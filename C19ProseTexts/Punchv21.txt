AT sun-rise this morning," PUNCH was alarmed—for one
minute only, by the repeater, taken from the head of his
bed—by the sound of guns. ...," Bless us!”, said we, “have
LIBERTÉ, EGALITÉ, FRATERNITE come to London, and are they
at it in the streets " More guns ! Hushing our beating
heart, we listened. Hark! That’s the Tower gun—and there
—that's the Park gun . It must be another royal arrival.
Well, we have seen no promise of it in the Morning Post, but
it must be another “addition to domestic happiness!”
We laid ourselves back again with the thought; when a
knock came at our bed-room door, and we heard the sharp,
eager voice of the Printer's Devil—“Wish you many happy
returns of the day, Sir " cried the little Devil.
“Day !” we answered, “what do you mean?”
“Mean, Sir! Why, please, Sir, have you forgot it, Sir!
This is your Birth-day, Sir. To-day, Sir, you're One-and-
Twenty Volumes old. They're a-firing the Tower guns, Sir;
and the Park s, Sir ; and they're going to roast bullocks
in the Green Park, Sir; and BARCLAY AND PERKINs gives
away three hogsheads on account of what they call the
'spicious day, Sir ; and we're to have rockets and blue lights,
—and now they're a-ringing all the City bells—don't you
hear 'em, Sir?—hurray! hurray!” And the Little Devil,
carried off his legs by his feelings, seemed at one jump to
reach the bottom of the stairs.
We again fell back in the bed, subdued, yet grateful with
the thought that warmed our heart. “It is true, true as
Time: we have attained our majority of paper and printſ
Yes; this present Christmas PUNCH is ONE-AND-Twenty
VolumEs OLD !”

iv. PREFACE.
How all the City Bells did ring ! What a shower of silver sounds they let fall upon the roofs, adown the chimneys,
in the streets' And our own bell of St. BRIDE's, with what a sweet significance it wagged its neighbourly tongue ! And all
rejoicing at the ONE-AND-Twº NTIETH Birth-day of PUNCH. We are proud to confess it: we did feel our heart-strings tremble,
sweetly responsive to the music.
We arose at our usual winter hour; and—there was the finger of luck in the matter—we unconsciously put on our
court suit; that very cut, velvet worked with amaranths adown the borders and pocket-holes, and spotted with forget-me-nots on
the body—together, with the satin waistcoat with those life-like halcyons worked in it—the whole to conclude with the
amber-coloured inevitables. (Yes; we endued ourselves in that very court suit which we have had prepared for us, when—at
a minute's notice and upon the last emergency—HER MAJESTY may wish to swear in the Privy *...)
We had scarcely breakfasted, when our jocund Publisher stood before us. He wore a wreath of mistletoe, and carried a
wand twined its full length with holly. “If you please, Sir,” said he, “they're come.”
“Who’s come 2'' we asked.
“Everybody's come, Sir. The guns have fired—the bells are ringing—and everybody's come. Which will you have
first, Sir LoRD JoHN RUssell or the LoRD MAYor?”
“LoRD John Why, you never mean”—
“They're all here, sir; but one and all, sir, say they'll take3. in the rough, and insist upon no ceremony. Twill be
more hearty and like yourself, they say, Sir. Which first, Sir? Lord Joms, or the Lord MAYor?”
And not awaiting an answer, our Publisher vanished, and the next minute we heard ceremonious footsteps treading the
stairs. Another minute, and Lord JoHN, with “all the Ministers in town,” stood in our modest apartment. We all bowed
to each other. -
Lord John then approached us—took us by the hand, and said, in his own epigrammatic way—“MR. PUNCH, as a
slight recognition of the value of your counsel—counsel, so modestly advanced, but that ever has its weight at a certain
Table—my colleagues and myself are here to congratulate you. It has been said, Sir, that the literary mind is ‘the unacknowledged
legislator of the world.' The saying is true; .." I hope the acknowledgment will henceforth be made as manifest. MR. PUNCH,
you have this day One-and-Twenty Volumes on your head; may every new Volume, like every Volume past, be only as a new curl
upon the head of SAMsoN–so that with a hundred Volumes you may stand like the giant of old, the stronger with every
growth !” (Cry of “Hear / Hear!” from Lord PALMERSTON.) -
e Lord CHANCELLOR and the JUDGEs next presented themselves. “MR. PUNCH,” said his Lordship, “we are here to
congratulate and thank you as a great law reformer. When HERCULEs cleansed the Augean Mews, he had (besides the river) a
broom. You, Sir, are mightier than HERCULEs. What can wº your river—sable stream —flowing from your ink-horn ?
And whilst your mighty goose-pen supplies at one end the power of the HERCULEAN besom, does it not—pointed and endowed like
ITHURIEL's spear—touch false seeming into true reality, with the other ?” (Cry of “Very Good / .” from MR. Justice TALFound.)
The Lord MAYon and ALDERMEN (in their robes) were next shown up His Lordship said, “MR. PUNCH, from the first
hour that you condescended to take up your abode in the City of London, which, Sir, I will venture to call the metropolis of the
world—(“Hear / Hear / " from SIR PETER LAURIE)—the City has felt, in a thousand ways, the beneficence of your whereabout.
Sir, since your wit has shone in Fleet Street, Fleet Street has never known a Fog—(cries of “Oh ſ”)—that is, not a Fog to speak of.
It is to you, Sir, that we owe the abolition of the tyrannous twopence taken heretofore at St. Paul's—it is owing to your irresistible
pen that the pens of Smithfield have no longer an iniquitous existence. And, Sir, to conclude, I feel that I am only possessed by that
traditional spirit of prophecy that has j all Lord Mayors, from WHITTINGTON to HUNTER, to predict that, whatever future good
shall descend upon the City, that good will full upon it fall—as from the feathers of a Bird of Paradise—from the pen-feather of
PUNCH.” (“Hear, hear !” from SIR PETER LAURIE ; who also says, aside, “An excellent speech; I shall certainly put it down.”)
And thus was PUNCH congratulated by various bodies, until, at four o'clock, he was left grateful, delighted, and exhausted,
alone in his arm-chair. He §. into slumber, when his faithful Publisher aroused him. “Sir” said he, “you must not
forget the dinner—five, punctual;-everybody will be there.” Enough ; we went forth and dined, dined with—but our Artist has
given the Company.
. However, we rose from table early, and accompanied by many of our friends, sallied forth. It was about nine o'clock in the
evening when we visited Hyde, Park. 'Even at Apsley, House, we began to smell the bullocks roasting in honour of our
Twenty-First Volume. Nor could there be, throughout the breadth and length of the land, # pºpulding bigger than PUNCH's

A Hollow Trick.
A wicker-work Elephant has been purchased for
the purpose of exhibiting, in the Crystal Palace, some
beautiful gold trappings that have been sent over
from India. We advise an inspection of this wicker-
work Elephant before it is admitted into the precincts
of the Palace, or else a surprise may be successfully
carried out—or rather carried in—after the manner of
the wooden Horse of Troy.—Who knows that CöloxEL
SIBThorr–and LoRD BROUGHAM—may not be con-
cealed, each in a leg of the Elephant, to enable them to
| emerge at night, and take a peep, unobserved, of the
| wonders of the Exhibition ?
THE HoRRORs of THE MIDDLE PASSAGE.-Our Fat
Contributor, on a very hot day, going through the
Lowther Arcade.
THE LAY OF THE LONDON WAN DE RER.
AM tired of the season, I am blasé of its sweets; "
I am getting sick of London, and the turmoil of the streets;
I have danced till I am dizzy º: polk'd till I am lame;
Each thing in the Crystal Palace I can almost tell by name;
I have feasted in the City, crammed with turtle to the throat.
Let me rush on board the steamer—let me take the Margate boat.
Wharfwards in a cab I hurry, and the driver puts me down,
Having earned his one-and-eightpence, having º mehalf-a-crown.
I have gained the gallant vessel, and the deck I boldly pace;
Funnels in my ear are shrieking-blacks are flying in my face.
Now, the Skipper skips before me, -on the paddle-box i. stands,
Making faces with his features, making signals with his hands:
Gallant tar, with bronzed complexion, hero often thousand trips,
In the little Greenwich steamers, and the larger Margate º :
Gallantitar, that brought the Daisy safely over Chelsea Reach,
When the water at its lowest scarcely covered half the beach :
Gallant tar, that brought the Brilliant safe athwart of Woolwich Pier,
With the Meteor slap afore her, and the Blazer in the rear:
Gallant tar, that has presided daily at the festive meal,
Sliced the bacon, cut the cabbage, pass'd the salt, and carved the veal;
Help'd the lady sitting near him to a bit of under-done,
Seasoning the dainty morsel with the lightly utter'd pun:
Gallant tar, that, after dinner, 'twixthis finger and his thumb
Takes the old familiar penn'orth of the old Jamaica rum:
Gallant tar, that gaily paces both the fore and after decks,
Taking—for the fares—the money, giving—in exchange—the checks.
Onward, through the muddy waters, goes the vessel in her course,
Banging 'gainst o'erladen barges with a superhuman force.
Hark, the cry of “Now then, stupid!” hark, the shout of “Awkward fool!”
Following each fresh collision in the overcrowded Pool.
Limehouse we have left behindus; Rotherhithe becomes a speck;
Greenwich seems to swim around us as we walk about the deck.
Qhjects now are growing little that were lately very big;
Tilbury is disappearing underneath the Captain's gig.
Soon the Nore we shall be passing-Youth itself at last may cloy;
Looking out, we can't help asking, “Who would always be abuoy?”
Now the water's getting rougher; pale-faced people grimly glide
To the windward of the vessel, hanging helpless o'er the side.
Now the Captain comes before us—every inch a gallant tar;
Qn his head an old sou’-wester, in his mouth a cheap cigar;
Round his throat a woollen kerchief, with a grog-drop in his º:
In his voice a tone of hoarseness as he bids the crew “stand by.”
Through the water rides the vessel; merrily our course we urge,
As old NEPTUNE seems to pledge us in a pot of foaming surge.
Past the Bay of Herne we ºl. that all-tranquil coast,
Where the sinecure policeman fattens on his useless post;
Where the architect's invention saw in fancy streets and squares,
But his plans, alas ! have ended in potatoes, corn, and tares.
We have left the Bay behind us; M. now attracts the sight,
With its Jetty on the ocean, and its windmills on the height:
There the Camera Obscura in its well-known watch-box stands;
PHILLPotts, CRickett, Wood, and PREEBLE, with machines adorn the sands.
Who is he that now is standing on the Pier or Harbour's brink,
With a coat whose cuffs and collar dazzle with intensest pink?
Can it be the local postman?—No, a nobler stamp he bears;
'Tis the uniform of Windsor this marine official wears. -
Can it be the Crown's Adviser, leaving Downing Street awhile,
For the baths, bazaars, and donkeys that abound in Thanet's Isle *

Even flymen cease their quarrels, as he passes through the town.

All respect him, save the urchins—Mischief's own acknowledged

Soft reflections thus indulging, twenty porters gather round,
Snatching my portmanteau from me, with obeisances profound.
Margate's shore my feet are touching. Though I’m in a stranger land,
Fifty hospitable greeters come to take me by the hand.

Crying, “Wright's lº'-the “York,” Sir!—“Ship,” Sir!—last, not

At each door a deputation to receive him will attend,.
Bowing him the outward welcome of an old familiar friend.

THE WAGGERIES OF WAGGETT.
THE House of Commons is in a fix for want of WAGGETT, the missing
witness in the St. Alban's Election case. A reward of º pounds has been
offered; but MR. WAGGETT does not mean to allow himself to go—or, rather
to come-at such ashabby figure. The factis, he seems waggishly disposed, an
appears to relish with a rich sense of humour the fun of an interview with the
Inspector, who goes after the witness, round the witness, and into the company
of the witness, without being able to touch the witness.
Snug in a French hotel
The witness loves to dwell.
And, in fact, MR. WAGGETT likes France so much, that he contemplates, it is
said, proceeding into the interior.
Those who would run after WAGGETT, as they would after the Hippopotamus,
the Elephant, or any otherlion of the day, must expedite their movements if º
wish to see the interesting object within an easy distance of London; for he
not, as he tells the Inspector, remain much longer “on view” at Boulogne.

Let me have a dozen chances in yon raffle for a doll.

A NICE LITTLE GAME–TO BE PLAYED ON A.
FOREIGNER:
If we hear of a violent assault—or perhaps a murder—bein
committed in broad daylight in Regent Street, we shall no
be in the least astonished at it. If anything fearful occurs
after the warning we have given, the fault will rest entirely on
the heads of the Police. ...; we think they ought to put
a stop to the games, however funny they may be, that are
being daily played by the street vendors who are attachés to the
h'hite Bear in Piccadilly. These facetious gentlemen delight
in practising their fun upon the pºor foreigners who spring
§. from the Richmond Busses. Their favourite game is the
ollowing:
-- º select the poor unfortunate foreigner who has the
longest beard. They surround him on all sides with bundles of
open razors in their hands. They follow him from street to
street, extolling their merits. He shrugs his shoulders—per-
haps laughs-then looks fierce—and implies by the most
expressive pantomimic gestures that he does not want any.
They still follow him, recommending their wares,-"Monseer
will find a razor will do him a deal of good.” The monseer gets
angry. They flourish their razors in his face. He stamps,
and, if Sacré be a French oath, he certainly swears. A crowd
collects. The little blackguards laugh—Monsieur contributes
unconsciously to the fun, by losing all command of his French
temper. If he raises his hand, or his foot, the delight of the
mob knows no bounds—It shrieks with laughter. The razors
are brandished still more vigorously in his face, accompanied
with witticisms which our reputation forbids us to repeat.
This game is carried on in the funniest manner, all the way up
Regent Street, till at last the unhappy object of it, takes
refuge in some billiard-room, or a cigar shop, and then there is
an end to the fun.”
Now, we are only afraid if a razor should happen to touch a
hair of the Frenchman's beard that the fun might take a very
different turn. We are very reluctant to interfere with the
amusements of the people, and have no desire to deprive
them. of one of their sports and pastimes; but the game in
question we denounce as a cruel one, and, if not stopped, will
certainly lead to the most serious consequences. Only con-
sider, for instance, what would be the fearful result if the
game were accidentally attempted upon Caussionese.
One Way of Getting Through the Exhibition.
WE hardly think it can be true that SIBTHoRP was in the
car of the balloon which nearly fell through the Crystal Palace.
The thing is so absurd, that we can scarcely give it credence—
and yet we have believed many absurd things of the Colonel in
his time. The stupid rumour is, that the Hon. Member for
Lincoln was anxious to visit the Exhibition unobserved,—and
that he had chosen the Balloon purposely, in order to give him
an opportunity of “dropping in” on the sly!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
It is quite easy to realise the considerable difficulty that the natives
of this old country are like to have in estimating the rapid progress of
ideas on all subjects among us, the Anglo-Saxons of the Western
World. Mind travels with us on a rail-car, or a high-pressure river-
boat. The snags and sawyers of prejudice, which render so dangerous
the navigation of Time's almighty river, whose water-power has toppled
over these giant-growths of the world, without being able to detach
them from the congenial mud from which they draw their nutriment
are dashed aside or run down in the headlong career of the Ünited
States mind.
We laugh to scorn the dangers of popular effervescence. Our
almighty-browed and cavernous-eyed statesmen sit, heroically, on the
safety-valve, and the mighty ark of our vast Empire of the West moves
on at a pressure on the square inch which would rend into shivers the
rotten boiler-plates of your outworn states of the Old World.
To use a phrase, which the refined manners of our ladies have
banished from the drawing-room, and the saloon of the boarding-
house, we go ahead. , And our progress is the progress of, all—not of
high and low, for we have abolished the odious distinction—but of man,
woman, and child, each in his or her several sphere.
Our babies are preternaturally sharp, and highly independent, from
the cradle. The high-souled American boy will not submit to be
whipped at school. That punishment is confined to negroes and the
lower animals.
But it is among our sex—among women-(for I am a woman, and
my name is THEodosia Eudoxia BANG, of Boston, U.S., Principal of
the Homoeopathic and Collegiate Thomsonian Institute for developing
the female mind in that intellectual city)—that the stranger may realise
in the most convincing manner the progressional influences of the
democratic institutions it is our privilege to live under.
An American female–for I do not like the term Lady, which suggests
the outworn distinctions of feudalism—can travel alone from one end
of the States to the other—from the majestic waters of Niagara to the
mystic banks of the Yellow-stone, or the rolling prairies of Texas. The
American female delivers lectures—edits newspapers, and similar organs
of opinion, which exert so mighty a leverage on the national mind of
our great people—is privileged to become a martyr to her principles,

and to utter her soul from the platform, by the side of the gifted
PoE or the immortal PEABODY. l this in these old countries is the
peculiar privilege of man, as op
signed to the slavish duties of the house. In America the degrading
cares of the household are comparatively unknown to our sex. The
American wife resides in a boarding-house, and, consigning the petty
cares of daily life to the helps of the establishment, enjoys leisure for
. pursuits, and can follow her vast aspirations upwards, or in any
other direction. . .
We are emancipating ourselves, among other badges of the slavery of
feudalism, from the inconvenient dress of the European female. ith
man's functions, we have asserted our right to his garb, and especially
to that part of it which invests the lower extremities. With this great
symbol, we have adopted others—the hat, the cigar, the paletot or round
jacket. And it is generally calculated that, the dress of the Eman-
cipated American female is quite pretty,+as becoming in all points as
it is manly and independent. I enclose a drawing made by my gifted
fellow-citizen, IncreaseN TARBox, of Boston, U.S., for the Free
Woman's Banner, a . under my conduct, aided by several gifted
women of acknowledged progressive opinions.
I ap to my sisters of the Old World, with confidence, for their
sympathy and their countenance in the struggle in which we are
engaged, and which will soon be, found among them also. For I feel
that I have a mission across the broad Atlantic, and the steamers are
now running at reduced fares. I hope to rear the standard of Female
Emancipation on the roof of the Crystal Palace in London Hyde Park.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
UNCH has to acknowledge the
receipt of several letters depreca.
tory of the observations which he
& has made on the subject of Homoeo-
& § and urging reasons for his
3 believing the so-called system of
medicine to be true, instead of con-
sidering it to be ridiculous. “The
Father of a large Family” assures
Mr. Punch that, “as the results of con-
siderable experience, it is the best family
system that could have been adopted.”
He states, that his wife “once regularly
had her days of physic-taking; ” besides
which, “on all occasions, for every symptom
or ailment, medicine was adopted as the
remedy; in fact, medicine-taking was of
almost daily recurrence.” He continues
—“And yet our children were ever sickly
and ailing.” . By “and yet?” Punch pre-
sumes that his correspondent means “and
therefore,” as he proceeds to say that he
ascribed these ailments to the medicine.
Under this impression he put a book on
Homoeopathy in his wife's way; she read it;
became a convert, to the doctrine of
HAHNEMANN; discontinued the medicine
as before, and began to physic herself and
children with infinitesimal doses instead—
the consequence being their restoration to
health.
..Very likely. Many of FATHER MATHEw's
disciples, doubtless, regained their health
- -- upon renouncing strong liquor. Had the
worthy Father administered homoeopathic globules along with the
pledge, they would have got well too--of course, a homoeopathist would
say, from taking the former rather than the latter. Unquestionably,
perseverance in infinitesimal doses may remove the effects of debauchery
in black draughts. The mischief arising from over-fondness for the
medicine-bottle may be remedied by exchanging it for the º:
pill-box. Infinitesimal doses are next to no physic whatever, and, cer-
tainly, next to that, they are the best remedies for having taken too much.
Mr. Punch has no doubt that homoeopathic doses will cure infinitesimal
diseases. He only, hopes that “The Father of a large Family” will
not, one of these days, lose some of its members through his wife's
treating her children homoeopathically when they are really ill.
Another correspondent, assuming the name of JUDY, reminds Mr.
Punch that her infant, when sick of a fever, was cured by . to a
bottle containing acqnite, and that he himself was once relieved of a
headache with which he had risen on the morning after a dinner-party,
by a globule which she had given him, clandestinely. As to the baby,
it is no child of Punch's, and he as little owns the headache, or an
other of the alleged facts. Moreover, as fevers often get well, and head.
aches go off in a few hours when left alone, he does not at all see what
would be proved }. the subsidence of either one or the other, after sniffing
at an agonite bottle, or swallowing an inappreciable quantity of medicine.
“It is quite provoking,” says JUDY, “to find you running down what
ou so little understand.” But who, does understand nonsense? She
#. Punch will not again “abuse Homºeopathy” until he has tested
its º in the mode recommended by himself., Mr. Punch must
decline taking that trouble till some case is made out for his doing so.
Failing this, he cannot be expected to investigate a theory which carries
apparent absurdity on the face of it. He is not bound to inquire whether
warts can really be whispered away, or toothache º by a charm,
before, he ventures to laugh at such superstitious quackery. It rests
with homoeopathists to prove their doctrines; in behalf of which
Mr. Punch has never met with any but homoeopathic arguments. To
be sure, their logic is more powerful than their doings, for their globules
have no perceptible operation on any organ of the body; whereas their
infinitesimal doses of reason and common sense produce a decided nausea.

style of travelling. It dispenses with everything in the shape of luggage.
Our only passport was a shilling. This passport is very convenient.
It requires no riséing. No allusions are made in it to your eyes; no
questions asked about your name, residence, or nose. You present your
assport at the door; it is taken from you;, and you never see it any more.
W. wish every passport was as º obtain, and as easy to get rid of.
We like travelling round the Globe. First of all, there is not a single
turnpike on the road. There is no dust, nor any throwing of eggs nor
flour, as on the journey from Epsom ; and again, there are no beggars,
as in Ireland,-no revolutions, as in France, no monks or mosquitos,
as in Italy,–and no insults, as in America. It is as easy as going up
stairs to dress, and coming down again to dinner.
The journey is made on foot. Young ladies who cannot travel any-
where but in their own carriage, must abandon all thoughts of travelling
round the Globe. It is true, the journey might be made on horseback,
but then the horse must be one of those “trained steeds” from
Astley's, which are taught to run up ladders without missing a single
step. The travelling, it must be, confessed, is rather . and
resembles very much a journey up the Monument. This resem lance,
however, arises entirely from the peculiar formation of the interior.
In this respect MR. WYLD has made a grand, discovery....He has
satisfactorily proved that the interior of the Globe, is not filled with
gases, according, to . AGAssiz; or with, fire, according to BURNET;
neither has he filled it, like Foubień, with water, as if the Globe were
nothing better than a globe of gold, fish. No ; MR., WYLD has lately
shown us that the interior of the Globe is occupied by immense strata
of staircases | - -
These staircases rise above one another, like, the steps in the Duke
of York's Column. This new theory must make travelling remarkably
easy for persons who are occupied all day long in running up and down
stairs, and seems as if it had been purposely laid down for maids-of-all-
work, or poor relations on a visit. -
Our first flight through the Globe—that is to say, when we came to
the first landing-place—convinced us that the crust of the Earth very
much resembled the crust of a beefsteak pie that had been considerably
overbaked. The inequalities on the surface, where the mountains are
supposed to rise, represented to our ingenious fancy the bumps caused
by the potatoes slumbering below, whilst the cracks, through which the
rivers are imagined to roll, disclosed to our mind's eye the crevices
in the crust that sometimes display such tempting glimpses of the rich
gravy that is flowing underneath.
This notion of the pie is not in the least overdone; for really the
heat of the Globe is equal to that of any baker's oven. We don’t
wonder at this, when we observed at every turn that there were small
jets of gas bursting out of the Earth, in a number almost sufficient to
roast a prize ox at any of the ensuing elections. The combustion of
these several gases raises the atmosphere of the Earth almost to boiling
point; and we are confident that if any one, anticipating a long journey
round the Earth, took his dinner with him, he could cook it on the
spot, free of expense.
The most curious thing is, that the higher a person ascends in the
World, the hotter it becomes for him; so that when he has reached the
reatest elevation a man can attain, he suddenly finds the World too
lot to hold him, and is obliged to come down again with a run. This
is a fine lesson of worldly ambition, which we experienced, for once,
ourselves. We felt the heat so excessive, and, fancying the Arctić
Regions must be of all regions the coldest in the World, we steamed our
panting way up there; but, will it be believed?—accustomed as we are
always to be at the top of the Pole, -we could not stand the climate of
early peas and pine-apples, that is almost at forcing-height in those icy
districts; and we were compelled to run down stairs to the Tropics as
fast as we could, in order to get cool again. It is lucky that there are
º of the Globe where a person can breathe with comfort, or else
R. WYLD would have made us regret that we had ever come into the
World at all !
And of this we should have been profoundly sorry; for, to speak the
truth, this World is a most beautiful one. It is most agreeable to stand
in the centre of the Earth, and to see yourself surrounded by oceans
and continents, first, to feast off a bit of land, and then to drink in
with your eyes a whole Atlantic faii of water."frink as much as you
will, you cannot take all the water in. You dread lest the waters should
close in around you, and swallow you up like a cork in the middle of
a water-butt. You cling to the railings for iº but the sight of
land cheers you the next moment. All the World is before you; you
have only to choose, where to go to. With a patriotic rush your eyes
run to England, and you are wonder-struck that a country which oc.
cupies, so large a lº in the thoughts of the world, should take up
so little room on the surface of it. England, that has filled so many

How true it is that the man who makes a pun will pick a pocket, may
be ascertained from the reports of last week's proceedings at the Old
Bailey. It will be found, from reference to those dismal records, that
a man has made a pun-that he has picked a pocket—that he has been
tried, and found guilty. . The facts are these :—An infatuated wretch,
of the name of Cotton, stole a handkerchief; and, on being called upon
for his defence, he declared “he thought it was his own, because it
was a Cotton one.” Judge and Jury felt at once how much the
atrocity of the pun added to the enormity of the offence. Who, after
this, will dispute the soundness of the axiom, that the man who can
make a pun will pick a pocket The thing has been logically proved;
and henceforth, whenever a punster is known to be present in a large

MR. PEPYS HIS GHOST AT THE QUEEN’S BALL.
UNCH has to thank his old friend,
MR, PEPys, for the following
June 13, 1851.-From Elysian
Fields to London to the great
Ball, which the QUEEN did give
to Night, in the Dress of my
Time, to see the Sight and the
Dresses, and whether they do
all right or no; and much, it do
delight me to visit the World
from Time to Time, and see what
goes on, and is as great a Plea:
sure, I think, as any I have, and
more than iſ coul hope for or
expect. The State Rooms thrown
open for the Ball, and all cram-
med with fine Ladies, the greatest
of the Court, besides the Foreign
Ministers and Ambassadours' Wives, and a Throne set for the
and the Court have come tol
Ladies or finer, and their Doublets, Trunks, and Sleeves decked out ||
with Ribands and Lace, and the Fashion of their Clothes for the most ||
QUEEN, and the PRINCE, with a Canopy of crimson Velvet fringed
with Gold, and a
flowered Satin and Silver Fringe, and the QUEEN and PRINCE sitting
on the Throne together in State, with so much Gold and Silver,
and Muslin, and Silks, and Satins of all Colours, and Diamonds, and
Pearls sparkling everywhere about them, and flowering Shrubs behind".
their State Chairs, that made, I think, the finest Sight I ever did see
in the World, and much finer than any Thing I saw when I lived there;
and good Lack, to think what Splendour and Magnificence the World
The Gentlemen's Dresses as fine as the
Part quite right and proper, and did do my Eyes good to see. The
QUEEN did wear the grand Dress of the Court of the French King that
was in my Time, mighty splendid, and more than it was then, which I
did not think possible, of grey watered Silk, trimmed with Gold and
Silver Lace and Bows of rose-coloured Ribands, fastened with Knots of
Diamonds; and the under Skirt of embroidered Cloth of Gold with
Trimmings of Silver Fringe, and the Gloves and Shoes embroidered,
too, with Gold Roses and Lilies, and four great Emeralds shaped like
Pears, and almost as big, on the Front of the Dress, cost more Money
than I can tell. Then to see the PRINCE in a Coat of Cloth of Gold
adorned with Roses and Jewels, and pink and white Feathers in his
Hat, and grey Silk Stockings, mighty, handsome, beyond what I ever
saw the King, in his Life, and I do think to get me a Suit like it. Bye-
and-bye the Band begin to play a March, and in come the Spanish
Quadrilles, danced by Lords and Ladies almost all, and then French
and Scotch and English Quadrilles, and then my LoRD STEwARD
walking backwards like a Crab, with great Reverence, did lead the
}. and the PRINCE from the Throne Room to the Ball Room, and
they did dance the Countess of WILTON's Quadrille with other great
Lords and Ladies and Gentlemen, and after that the QUEEN did lead
off the Polonaise, and the Company followed two and two, which was
mighty pretty; and both the QUEEN and the PRINCE do dance rarely.
But to think how different the Fashion of Dancing, what with Waltzes,
and Polkas, and Gallops, is to what it was as I remember, and how
unlike the Priscº do behave to the King, in dancing with the Ladies,
and the Ladies too, to the Ladies in my Time; which is more handsome;
but, methinks, not so much Sport. Glad and pleased mightily to hear so
many Tunes played that I knew, but did not hear “Beauty Retire,” which
and
Iexpected to hear, but did not, which vexed me to the Heart. I did also
lºok to see them dance the Brantle, but they did not, #." Country-
Dance which I did hear the King at his Great Ball at Wiſtehall once call
for by Name. I did see the Duke of WELLINGTON in the Dress of a
General of the King's Troops, and mighty glad to have a Sight of him,
and to see how well he do bear his Years. But what did most delight
me was to see my LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE in the Robes of JUDGE º
did hope to see him dance therein. I did also hope LoRI,
BRough AM would be there in the Dress of the King's Lord Chancellor,
and had set my Heart on seeing him dance the Polka, which methought
would be great Merriment, and am sorry I could not see. At little
after Midnight the QUEEN and PRINCE to supper, and fell to heartily,
and then back to the Ball Room to dance; and the QUEEN did dance
with the PRINCE OF LEININGEN in a gold Brocade Waistcoat and
black Velyet Breeches, which I did mightily admire. The Dancing
kept up, I do think, till past two in the Morning, but I *: at Cock-
- . leaving them dancing, and I mighty delighted at what I had
beheld, and yery noble it was and great Pleasure to see ; and have done
much, good to Trade. So Home to Supper off Nectar and Ambrosia,
and did relate what I had seen to my Wife, and very merry we were,
only I think she did not like to hear me talk so much of the Court
contribution from the Shades:—||
ſº Cornice, at the Top, and lined with ||
Ladies; but I do fear she, poor Wretch, is more of a Fool still than I
could have imagined, or almost believed, she being now in the State

MEDITATIONS IN THE EXHIBITION.
BY MR. DOLDRUMS.
I visiTED the Crystal Palace,
And there I saw a crowd as great
As ever gathered round a gallows;
A mob is just what I do hate. -
Thought I, This multitude immense
Seems full of happiness and glee;
Yes, but in two or three years hence
I wonder where or how they’ll bel
Those foreign goods are very well,
As something merely to behold;
But our own wares they’ll undersell,
And so will drain away our gold :
It something may the mind enlarge
To view the works of every clime;
But then a shilling is the charge-, ...
And so one spends both cash and time.
The Arts encouraged thus, indeed,
To many must afford employ;
But then to luxury they lead, .
And that the million can’t enjoy.
The people's taste they may refine;
But, on the other hand, 'tis clear
They'll cause the masses to repine,
And wish to live above their sphere.
We may learn º; good, 'tis true,
- By mixing with each foreign nation;
But we shall catch their vices too.
It may be that fraternisation
With those from whom we stood aloof
Before, will foster peace and union;
But—here a Clown with hobnailed hoof
Trod right upon my favourite bunion.
TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE INDUSTRY OF ALL NATIONS 1
SHOULD the Great Exhibition be repeated a few years hence, the
Mºſ department may perhaps be enriched with an invention
which will put the nose of FRIAR Bacon's Brazen, Head quite out of
joint. MR. ALFRED SMEE, author of a work on “Electro-Biology,”
has just published another volume, entitled The Process of Thought,
wherein he says, that—
“From the laws which have been already detailed, it is apparent that thought is
amenable to fixed principles. By taking advantage of these principles, it occurred to
me that mechanical contrivances might be formed which should oboy similar laws, and
give those results which some may have considered only obtainable by the operation
of the mind itself.”
In plain terms, MR. SMEE conceives it possible to construct, a
thinking apparatus; and he actually talks of a “rational” and a “dif-
ferential machine,” by whose combined action he proposes to imitate
the operations of the mind. If MR. SMEE can bring these contrivances
of his to bear, he will confer a great boon upon the insane; as those
who have lost their wits will then perhaps be enabled to have artificial
brains made for them, as easily as a person who has suffered amputation
is supplied with a wooden leg. Advertisements will invite our attention
to “An Entirely, New Description of Intellectual Faculties,” or “A
New Discovery in Brains,” or MR. So AND So’s “Patent Cerebral
Succedaneum, Warranted Never to Decay, or Fall Out.” The pro-
gressive perfection of mental machinery will render it applicable to
purposes of greater and greater delicacy, and we shall have automatic
poets and musicians—mechanical ShakspeaREs and BEEthovens–
actuated by steam and electricity, instead of genius; and excelling live
bards and composers as much as a power loom excels a hand loom.
Cabinets will be literally constructed, by an improvement in Cabinet-
making, and the functions of Parliament will be executed by instruments
evolving legislative wisdom.
At present, however, it does not appear that any cogitative
machine equal to a single donkey power has been really produced; and
perhaps, on the whole, the following brief epigram, addressed to the
author of The Prºcess of Thought, is the correct expression of the
general opinion of his project for performing that process by mecha-
illsill --
“MR. SMEE
Fiddle de dee!”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN INSTRUCTOR OF THE FOREIGNER.
T Marylebone Office one JoHN
FRANCIs BIGGE—“of military
appearance”—was charged b
SIR GEORGE ARMYTAGE wit
spitting. in his face. And
IGGE did not deny the fact:
nay, BIGGE rather applauded
himself for the unseemly deed.
He moreover admitted that a
few days before “he had spat
in the face of a Frenchman.”
MR. BROUGHToN sentenced
BIGGE “to pay £3 or "-(and
here.we have the beauty of
English law, that makes ruffian-
ism the purchaseable luxury
of the man of money)—“or to
be imprisoned for six weeks.”
\ . What a lesson is this for our
- º visitors! A Frenchman
has his face spat upon; and
- - his condoling remedy is—the
dirty fellow who commits the mastiness, can afford it! In England, you
may be a brute, if you can lay down sixty shillings, the police price of
the brutality.
AN ORANGE INSULT.
[For the Tipperary Fire-eater.]
WITH inexpressible feelings of burning indignation we have to call
the attention of all Ireland to a speech said to be delivered by PRINCE
ALBERT at a meeting of a society calling itself a Society for the Propa-
gation of the Gospel. There is not an Irishman whose heart beats in
the right place who will not, with flashing eyes, burning brow, and
clenched, sinewy hands, read what it is our awful duty to lay before
him. The PRINCE said—
“This Society was first chartered by that great man, WILLIAM III. (cheers), the
greatest sº this country has to boast of (loud cheers), by whose sagacity and
energy was closed that bloody struggle for civil and religious liberty which had so long
been convulsing this country, and were secured to us the inestimable advantages of our
constitution and of our Protestant faith (loud cheers)."
Yes, they "cheered.” The brutal Saxon, gloating over the miseries
of this afflicted—this outraged country, bleeding from ten thousand
gashes—the malignant Saxon raised his wolfish shout at the name of
that man whose iron heel was stamped upon the breast of Ireland.
A great man! Will ye forget this, ye men of Erin P “WILLIAM
THE THIRD, the greatest sovereign this country has to boast of !”
And, why “the greatest ?” Because—can there be a doubt of the
insult?—because he drove from the rightful divinity of his throne, that
really greatest sººn the brutal Saxon has in reality “to boast of”
—JAMES THE SEcoSD!
“Our Protestant faith !” But with CARDINAL WIseman firm as a
rock in Westminster, we may afford to smile at the insult. Yes; and
with that ºd band, our own Irish brigade—for we accept
the term as a distinction—our own brigade “in burning row” in a Saxon
House of Commons, we will smile; we say, we will smile; smile, and
silently swear-swear !!!
THE FRONT ROW OF THE SHILLING
GALLERY.
WE like occupying the Front Row of the Gallery on a Shilling day of
the Exhibition, and comfortably seated down, with plenty of ...'.
our legs, to enjoy all the little incidents that are being quietly exhibited|d
below. It is like going behind the scenes—if a person can be up in the
gallery and behind the scenes at the same time—and peeping at the
audience through a hole in the big curtain.
The great mob keeps playing about the floor like an immense sea of
Jack:o'-lanterns. You cannot look at them without winking. It is a
Quadrille of colours—a Reel, of prismatic rays—which may well turn
the poor Koh-i-moor pale with envy. There they are dancing in the
most fantastic figures—-Poules—Pastorals—Pantalons innumerable—
Grandes Rondes without end round the Crystal Fountain—Cavaliers
Seuls looking after their, partners—and inextricable Chaînes de Dames
extending, like garlands, the whole length of the building. Fancy these
all moving, surging, tossing together, whilst, countless sets are wildly
rushing up and down the middle, and balancer-ing, like summer lightning,
from one side to the other, and you will have but a poor notion, after
all, how PEté is danced through, with a gaiety it has never known
before, at this year's Exhibition. The dazzling effect we can only
compare to a series of TURNER's pictures being viewed, on a summer's
day, through the windows of an express train, going at the rate of
sixty miles an hour.
After a time, however, this flying panorama of colours slackens its
speed, a bit, and the eye, at first blinded by the immense glare,
begins gradually to recover its power, and to settle on distinct objects.
Here it †. a sunny corn-field of bonnets, gracefully waying

scene; there it can discriminate a sullen acre of black hats, running in
lines, like a newly-ploughed field. . In one spot is a rich garden blooming
with all the gorgeous hues of fashion;, and, in another direction,
spreads an immense plantation of poplar-looking boys, and of sturdy
men of the circumference of oaks. The scene grows before you, and
almost articulates; here a Statue speaks, and there a bright fountain
leaps up, laughing like a child, with joy. It is, to be extatic, a living
chapter of Boccacio read alond with the eyes.
But we must descend from our imaginative balloon, and step on earth.
The cynosure (or rather, the sinecure) of all eyes seems to be the
Koh-i-moor diamond. , Poor jewel—there is something the matter with
it, for it disdains to shine. It has been lately served up with gas—but
this, apparently, has only subjected it to more roasting than before.
There is something touching in the fact of a sick diamond calling in
the assistance of one of its poor relations—for both the diamond and
gas are descended from the same family of coal—which said family, by-
the-bye, must be about the oldest family in the world, for it. numbers
more generations under ground than any other. But this is not the
first time, by many, that the Koh-i-noors of society only shine with the
borrowed light of those working beneath them in station' But we
leave the perfect setting of this brilliant moral to others.

That your petitioners belong to a class of persons of highly respectable
exterior, whose character, from personal acquaintance, can be vouched
for by HER MAJESTY's police.
That the body of well-dressed and decently-conducted individuals
whereof your petitioners, are members, are dependent, for their sub-
sistence on their manual dexterity applied in relieving HER MAJESTY's
subjects at large of proprietary encumbrances by a peculiar process of
extraction, and conveyance or transference.
That your petitioners thus levy on the subjects of HER MAJEsty a
species of contributions somewhat of the nature of taxes, and differing

That when any objection is made to the said contributions, levied, as
aforesaid, by your said petitioners, an appeal lies to the nearest magis-
trate, who usually disposes of your petitioners' case by a very summary
rocess of justice,—if justice that award can be called which usually
inflicts much laborious exertion, and other severe hardships on your
petitioners.
That there is another class of persons, not at all, superior to your
petitioners in respectability, and who cultivate a similar but a less in-
offensive branch of industry; such persons being connected in divers'
official capacities with HER MAJESTY's Board of Customs.
That the persons in question are wont and accustomed to seize and
take various and sundry goods, chattels, and merchandize, in excess of
their warrant as defined by statute : that is to say, after the manner of
your petitioners: only that they, the said persons, very frequently make
captures and seizures enormously larger than your petitioners ever
make—the value of the said captures and seizures amounting in many
instances to thousands of pounds.
That whereas a mistake made by your petitioners in the abstraction
of a silk handkerchief, worth but a few shillings, renders them amen-

STARVED-OUT AMBASSADORS.
Gover NMENTs guilty of extravagance have been subject to so much
cutting up, that, cutting down has become a recognised branch of
administrative policy.
There is, however, a good deal of tact required
to leave in-tact those expenses which are for the public good, and
diminish those that exist to the public detriment.
There can be no doubt that the reductions in our diplomatic establish-
ments are very wholesome; and though we should not wish to see our
diplomatic relations reduced to very poor relations, a good deal may yet
be done—or, rather, undone—in this department of our outlay. Our
Ambassador to Paris, Lord NorMANBY, who likes to do things on a
liberal scale, has undergone a reduction of income which may, as hinted
by Loºp PALMERston in the House of Commons, lead to some curtail-
ment of the dinners that a certain class of the English in Paris expect
to be invited to.
We don’t see that the dignity of England is enhanced by the in-
dulgence of a few travelling gourmands, and we are fº. therefore,
that the country will be spared the expense, and the Ambassador the
trouble, of entertaining them. We do not, however, wish to see the
MARQUIs or NortMANBY, or any other Ambassador, cut down to an
inconveniently low figure, which would prevent him from cutting any
figure at all; and we will take LoRD PALMERSTON's word for it, thai,
since the Republic has thrown Paris so thoroughly out of luck, there
has been more lure than ever. Of course, when in France, the
ust do as France does, and it must, require a large
amount of English gold to keep pace with the French Capital.

Lenten Entertainment at the Mansion House.
MR. PUNCH begs to offer his Puseyite friends his condolence on the
circumstance that the Lord MAYor gave, the other day, a grand dinner
to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, which the ARch-

prelates, helped to eat. Punch would console his genuflective readers

THE CRYSTAL PALACE-TO THE RESCUE.
MR. PAXTON asks—“What is to
become of the Crystal Palace £’”
And MR PAxton replies to the
question in a manner at once de-
lightful and practicable. He says,
let the Crystal Palace be a
“Winter Park under Glass.”
And then in his own workman-
like, characteristic way, he pro-
ceeds to show what a Garden of
Eden for the sons and daughters
of fallen ADAM may blossom and
look green in Hyde Park; the
while an English winter shall rage
outside the Crystal panes, and
with
“— the secret ministry of frost
Shall hang them up in silent icicles,
Quietly shining to the silent moon."
With a few sentences our Crystal
Magician fills the palace with
every condition of natural and
artistic beauty... Fountains leap
up, and fall in diamond showers;
orange groves blossom ; statues
—a "whole Walhalla of English
worthies—gleam whitely from
among the trees; the atmosphere
is fraught with odours; and still,
old º winter, in his most savage mood, may bluster, without biting almost the heart of English oak.
The Crystal Palace, then, is not to melt away like the silver mist of a summer morning. No ; it is
to stand, a brilliant and enduring monument of the genius of its designer; a monument, a thousand
times more glorious to him than is the Great Pyramid to the questionable memory of its architect.
The glass shall outshine the granite.
For there can be no doubt that MR. PAxton's question, “What is to become of the Crystal Palace £º
will be answered by a consenting, and, we may add, a grateful people, in the words of the querist himself: be
“let the Crystal Palace become a Winter Park under Glass.” Already, we can anticipate somewhat of
the ceremony that shall inaugurate the *f; of the Crystal Paradise: that shall give a fitting welcome
and an enduring home to English Flora. There is QUEEN VICTORIA, with a wreath of roses around
her brow, PRINCE ALBERT with the olive branch, the Royal Children with buds and blossoms, and all the
officers of the Court and Household in appropriate costume, and bearing floral and sylvan emblems.
And now, PAXTON, turns up the soil; - -
Chamberlain's wand—and the QUEEN plants the young tree in commemoration of the day, and—
“From yon blue heavens above us bent,
The grand old gardener and his wife
Smile"
upon the act. For that tree shall stand for hundreds of years, the green monument of the happy,
humanizing thought that caused the nations of the earth to come together in their works beneath a
crystal temple; to engage in the contest of commerce and art; and thence to take away a solemn lesson
continually teaching peace and good-will towards all men. - - -
And PRINCE ALBERT will also plant his own monumental olive—and every one of his children some
tree henceforth to bear the name of the planter, to flourish for generations “a kindred grove.” This,
Punch, with his old, prophetic eye, already sees: meanwhile, let the great Gardener ADAM Paxton
speak in the present:—
“In the Winter Garden I propose, climate would be the principal thing studied. All the furnishing and fitting up would
have special reference to that end, so that the pleasures found in it would be of a character which all who visit could share.
Here would be supplied the climate of Southern Italy, where multitudes might ride, walk, or recline, amidst groves of
fragrant trees; and here they might leisurely examine the works of Nature and Art, regardless of the biting east winds or the
drifting snow.” -
“MR. PAXTON never failed in anything he undertook,” is the testimony of the princely Devonshire;
and we already see the gleaming statues, we already snuff the fragrancy of the trees in Paxton's
pamphlet, even though at present they stand only in words, and are redolent of nothing more odorous
than printer’s ink. MR. PAxton proceeds, laying out his garden in type:
“Beautiful creeping plants might be planted against the columns, and trailed along the girders, so as to give shade in
summer, while the effect they must produce, by festooning in every diversity of form over the building, would give to the
whole a most enchanting and gorgeous finish.”
And the beauty of the inner garden would smile upon the outside winter. MR; Paxton is gene.
rously, anxious for the comfort of the opposite neighbours to the Garden, annoyed by the “turmoil of
so vast an undertaking as the Great Exhibition,” and therefore shows that no such discomfort could
arise from his future plan. The whole wooden boarding of the Crystal Palace would be replaced wit
glass. It would, therefore, be “a thing of beauty” and “a joy for ever” without; and within, “for
the six winter months, a climate equal to Southern Italy'. - - - -
b . MR. Paxton is not yet done with the Garden. He further proposes to stock it with animate
caut --
“There might be introduced a collection of living birds from all temperate climates, and the science of Geology, so closely
connected with the study of plants, might be illustrated on a large and natural scale, thus making practical Botany,
Ornithology, Geology, familiar to every visitor."
Who, knows? We may yet see live humming-birds in London; see them building and sitting,
familiarly as we now see º: At present we are ſain to be richly content with the feast
of beauty daily set before us by MR,Gould's ºf. collection—jewels in feathers!—nevertheless,
we cannot forego the hope of beholding the live London humming-bird feeding upon the honey of the
flower blossoming in Hyde Park.

THE GRAND HATCHING YEAR.
HE year 1851 was looked
upon as a Grand Hatching
Year. The number of things
A that were to have been
hatched this twelvemonth
would require a Catalogue al-
most as long as the one of the
Exhibition to detail them all.
Suppose we describe the
result as we would a visit to
MR. CANTELo's Incubator, in
Leicester Square.
We are shown into a room
papered with patterns of the
Crystal Palace — that being
the Great Imaginary Oven
by whose magic heat j
thing was to be hatched.
The fact is, the year 1851 was
looked upon as a great Se
with the Golden Eggs, that
was to lay a golden egg for
every one. It remains, now
to be proved—and that is the
object of our present visit—
how many of these golden eggs.
have brought forth anything?
In the middle of the room
are large chests of drawers,
smoking away like the grating
of a cook-shop. The drawers
pull out, like those of any
; : fº, and are º to
e full of eggs—eggs large
and small—eggs i. and
blue, and a good sprinkling of
them green-eggs sound, and
others cracked—so cracked,
in fact, as to let any one see
that there is literally nothing
in them. These cracked eggs
are very pitiful to view, and
suggest ridiculous ideas, that
the geese who laid them must
have been anything but
Solons !
The heate of the place is
intolerable. We are sure it
is at fever-height, as if it had
been regulated by the expecta-
tions of those who had expec-
ted to realise large fortunes.
We were standing opposite to one of the open drawers, and were running our
i. and our fingers—the latter most tenderly, lest we should get them burnt—
along the surface, when a gentleman, with a CHARLEs MATH Ews tone of familiarity,
came up, and volunteered the following explanations:- - - -
“This large egg, Sir, was sent to us by a Theatrical Manager. You see it is
marked at the top ‘Overflowing Audiences.” It burst in less than one month after
the Exhibition had opened. The manager has never been to claim it. I have
heard that he º a-night at least to come out of this egg. We took
the greatest pains with the hatching, and kept puffing and puffing at the fire all
day; but, somehow, nothing would make it draw. I am sure we put on all the
what I know, those broken egg-shells before you, may
steam we could. We fed it with the best French pieces, but they only went off
in smoke, and did more harm than good to the poor egg. Sad thing, Sir, but we
wºº afraid the egg was a little addled. - -
“This nest of eggs, Sir,” continued our lively cicerone, “was presented to us
by a lodging-house keeper. You see they are of all sizes. They represent the
different floors in the lady's establishment. The largest marked ‘4210 10s. A-week,
witHout PLATE of Atten pance,' represents the drawing-room; the two smallest,
labelled respectively, “10s, ANd las, A-week—Boot-cLEANING Extra,’ are the front
and back attics. Poor woman! We paid every attention to her eggs, but you see
there is not a sound one amongst them, except the back attic, which is occupied
by an Irish M.P., and which can scarcely be called a nest-egg, for he will neither
pay nor quit. Floor after floor gave way; foreigners were slow in coming, or else
wouldn't pay the large sums that were demanded, till, as the season advanced,
the house regularly fell in, like an ommelette-soufflée, and the back attic is all that
remains of the splendid mansion the lady had raised in her mind of this year's
profits. It’s a pity, Sir; but some people are not content with hatching their
eggs, but must attempt to force them; and the consequence is, they break, like
so many railway bubbles.”
He pursued his moral journey
with the sharp edge of a truth. “
round the room, cracking an egg at every step
This one,” he said, holding an egg of all colours
before the light, “was a Panorama nearly as long as the
Wall of China. It was to be descriptive of a suit in
Chancery. The proprietor expected a fortune to spring,
ready-made, out of it. He took a large room, and, relying
upon the proneness the English have for "...; into any-
thing like Law, expected that thousands would flock to
his Exhibition. But, curiously enough, the thousands per-
sisted in stopping away. Probably they thought that, if
they once went—such would be the natural representation
of the Chancery picture—that it would require nothing less
than a lifetime to appreciate it. It’s painful to think,
Sir, that a project which looked so very pretty in the egg,
should be smashed ‘all to nothing’ in the hatching. The
Chancery Panorama has since been cut up for the canvas,
to make workhouse suits for paupers.”
There was a whole, drawer-full of broken tradesmen,
whose greediness of gain had egged them on to their own
destruction. There they lay i whipped together, as if
ready for a pancake. Our informant told us that over:
expectation had been the breaking of them all. They had
asked prices which no countryman or foreigner, however
bent upon pleasure, had chosen to give. Each tradesman
had his name on his egg, which was so much towards
turning it into a tombstone to be laid over the fortune he
expected to pick out of it: , “The amount of fortunes
thus broken on the head, and lying together in a confused
heap, has never been surpassed,” added our oval philo-
sopher, “since the days of the Railway Mania.”
“We now come to another drawer,” he continued, “as
peculiar as any of the others, but a little more cheerful in
its aspect. You see it is full of eggs, black and ill-shaped
as they can be. They are too foul even to be thrown by a
Gentleman on a Derby, Day. They are ominous-looking
§. and I am very flº they never came to anything.
ose eggs they are, I cannot tell, but I should imagine
they, were serpents' eggs—eggs of the most venomous
reptiles-eggs, I hope, #. never will be hatched in Eng-
land. The names, written in red marks on the outside
offer us, luckily, some clue to their origin. You will
observe some are labelled “Socialist,’ and others ‘Demo-
cratic.” This large monster of an egg, that looks as mis-
chievous as a bombshell, bears for inscription, you remark,
the word, “Mountain.”
“These titles lead me to believe that they were intended,
when hatched, to scatter over England a brood of the most
oisonous doctrines that ever laid waste a beautiful country.
ou know the report that was widely circulated before the
opening of the Exhibition, that all sorts of conspiracies
were being hatched in this country. It was said we should
have armies of Republicans first fighting us, and, after we
had been all killed, fighting amongst themselves. We were
to have troops of Socialists carrying about with them the
torch of discontent wherever they wandered. We were to
have bands of Red Democrats stalking about the country
like wild beasts, devouring every master that ſell in their
way, and distributing his well-earned property amongst
his servants. The Crystal Palace was to be shattered into
a thousand pieces, and its aisles to be desecrated with the
horrors of Civil War, instead of being solemnised, as now,
with the blessings of Universal Peace. In lieu of being
the cradle of international civilisation, it was to have been
the tomb, amidst the ruins of which, it was prophesied
PRINCE ALBERT, like a modern MARIus, would be heard
mourning in six different languages. All these vile things,
it was said, were being hatched in this country; and, for
º
have contained the germs of them. What I do know, is
that nothing I ...iſ do would rear them; from which i
imagine that there is something in the atmosphere, of
England, let it be heated at times as much as it will, that
is not favourable to the growth of such doctrines, and
extent in a free country. “Therefore you see, gentlemen,”
said our moralising guide, before showing us to the door,
“that fully as much Good as Evil has attended our hatchin
operations this year. If most of the theatrical, commercial,
and social eggs, that were laid in this prolific Annus
Mirabilis, have failed in being properly hatched, and in
yielding that large amount of gain that was expected to be
reared from them, still we should remember that all the con-
spiracies, of which the Crystal Palace was to have been the
barricade-ground this year, have also as signally failed in the
hatching—which will be a lesson, I hope, to Socialists “never
to count their chickens until they are hatched,’—at least,
not in the English market.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 15
THE SAILoR AND THE TAILoR;
or, THE BATTLE of THE THAMEs.
RING forth the leaden ink-
stand, of steel the sharp-
est pen;
For lead and steel should
chronicle the deeds of
fighting men.
Fierce battle's rage must
now engage the poet's
tuneful lyre
How the "tailor was the
uailer before the sailor's
e.
On the banks of old
Thamesis there rose a
country seat;
A tailor had selected it,
and call’d it his Retreat.
Within its small planta-
tions a retrospect he cast
Upon the work of days
gone by-the labours of
the past.
Within the little garden he
... plied once more the shears,
In cutting out the suits of green—the livery Nature wears.
Kind Nature he adored; for she, to bless his later life,
Took from him, in a generous mood, a vixen of a wife.
'Twas on an Easter Monday-oh, how he loved the day,
That snatch'd, to his extreme delight, the termagant away!
He kept it ever afterwards, and with the rising sun
He usher'd in his happiness with joy-proclaiming gun.
There was a gallant sailor, an old Whitechapel tar,
That fought on board the Gravesend boats in opposition's war;
He’d seen the fares diminishing—and he had kept afloat,
When the railway, with its iron rule, lorded it o'er the boat.
‘Twas beautiful to hear him, over his pipe of º
Boast of the passages he'd made to Herne's enchanting Bay;
The water was his element, he little cared for land;
A. * º bought, in which he cruised 'twixt Putney and the
t
Tanu.
She was a clipper of her kind, rigg’d tautly fore and aſt—
A spanker under canvas-a-rightish, tightish craft.
Her jib was pleasant to behold, graceful her stern and round;
Her tonnage it were hard to guess—at least, within a pound.
A. f. crew she had aboard—a mate who loved the seas,
Who danced a naval hornpipe with elegance and ease;
Besides two jolly British tars, who'd learn'd within a week
Qſ marlin-spikes and tiller-ropes familiarly to º ła
Who never touch'd a thing on board without a wi d". hotº
Who at each gust would warble “How the stormy winds do blow!”
Who neverlet a Frenchman’s name fall on their British ears ºl
Without a wish that they might meet with some of “them Mounseers.”
Exclaiming with the º shriek, “We never will be slaves!”
Androaring out in cºncert, “Bºtºxia rules the waves.”
It chanced the gallant vessel, with alther canvas spread
Was 'gainst a wind from Battersea cleverly making head:
When from the shore there came the roar of cannon, loud and deep ; :
The day that took his wife away, the tailºr chanced to keep.
Whitechapel's gallant seaman, the festive signal heard;
To pipe all hands for action, he gave at once the ºw
The mate put on his dancing pumps; an d'high with joy;
He call'd on deck the old :::::::::::#. lºbby.
The gallant grewºisºftwººd,
"Now;avast heaving!” and at once were at the vessef’s side.
The old Whitechapeſ seaman, hearing the tº's fire,
Exclaimed—“Those lubbers on the land an *inst require.
Quick!ºman the guns!” He scarce had dropp'd the sentence frºm his
mouth, ---. -
When three were pointed to the north; the ºthers to the south:
From the tea-canister was brought er in attice;
They weigh’d out six half-bu precision mice; -
They ramm'd it down with walking-sticks, and at the well-known word
Proceeding from the gallant craft a loud report was heard.
The tailor and his company were seized with fear and ire;
“Pirates assail us,” roar'd the host; “let us return the fire,
But not with harmless powder. Oh! here's a fearful scrape.
Go, Richard, to the hot-house and º and find some grape.
I wish my geese were swans, alas! unhappily they’re not;
But if they were, we might send back some real swan's-egg shot.”
Thus said the frighten’d tailor; his guests were just as bad;
With anger, flurry, and alarm, the host was almost mad.
“What’s to be done? can nobody the knotty point unravel,
How to return the pirate's fire? I have it now—the gravel.”
The thought was quickly acted on, the tailor's guns they load
With gravel from the gravel-walks, and pebbles from the road.
"Now at 'em!” cried the tailor, and, swift as lightning, flew
A shower of stony º: midst the Whitechapel crew.
The mate he danced his hornpipe with desperation bold;
The crew of two, caboose and boy, took refuge in the höld;
The brave Whitechapel seaman still walk’d about the decks,
Observing the phenomenon through his gold-mounted specs.
He gazed until a pebble—one larger than the rest—
Struck him upon his double chin, and dropp'd upon his breast.
As flint will raise the heated spark, so rose the seaman's ire;
The stone had struck from out his breast fierce indignation's fire.
He piped all hands, and roar'd aloud for all his gallant crew,
His mate, caboose, loblolliboy, and British seamen two.
...Return the rascal's fire,” he cried; “direct a bold attack;
Upon the fellow's chimneys aim—straight into yonder stack.”
Great was the crash of pottery, and dismal was the growl
Qf the tailor o'er his weathereock, his chimneys, and his cowl;
But, not content the house-top with bricks and tiles to strew,
The bold Whitechapel seaman summon'd his gallant crew,
The mate that danced the hornpipe, and eke the old caboose,
Who suddenly was called upon to cook a tailor's goose.
A landing they effected—at the Retreat they dash;
The tailor and his followers felt they had been too rash.
The mate and the loblolliboy made a terrific rush;
The tailor setting up a whine, ran to the nearest bush;
But speedily they captured him; they took him from the land;
His trial by court-martial they straightway made him stand.
The old Whitechapel admiralthen ask’d him from the chair,
“The flag of Britain to insult, how could the culprit dare?”
Inaudible his answer—for fear, in wildest freaks,
Had gumm'd the tailor's mouth up, and blanch'd the tailor's cheeks.
They found the tailor guilty; then what shall be the fine?
A tarring and a feathering forthwith upon the line.
He begged aloud for mercy—he knew on such mishap
He couſinot plume himself, nor boast a º in his cap.
He turn’d him to the gallant mate, but turn'd him all in vain,
Then to the young loblolliboy, then to the seamen twain.
The sentence was inflicted—and he was put aground.
Where the mud, and broken bottles, and oyster-shells abound.
The office of his lawyer, when he revived, he sought,
To take his retribution out within the County Court.
But there the poet makes a pause—the poetstands with awe
Upon the stony threshold of the abode of law;
The poet dare not enter; for though he braves the seas,
For him, alas! too stormy the atmosphere of fees.
Sosilently withdrawing, he leaves the angry pair—
The sailor- e-tailor—to fight their battles there.
*OKANGEISMIN THE CRYSTAL-PALACE:
The Crystal Palace, doubtless, would make a magnificent orangery;
but it is a pity that MR. Paxton's splendid structure should be turned
into an orange-peelery, as it has begun to be by the youthful consumers
of the fruit, whose golden rind they have taken to fling about the floor.
This practice is equivalent to }º. the publica slippery-trick, the
nsequence of which may be a direct encouragement of surgery, never

but country visitors to tº Exhibition, who are in the habit of slaking
their thirst at these fountains, and have been used to the genuine form
of that beverage, cannot but be disgusted with aqueous tincture of
orange peel and infusion of cahe. We are sorry to suggest an invasion

We understand that the Commissioners of
Police are about to issue orders for the regula-
tion of the now inconveniently crowded balloon
traffic of the Metropolis. So long as the intrepid
voyagers were likely to confine #. collisions to
each other, it was not thought necessary for the
| authorities to interfere, as the evil was likely to
correct itself to a certain extent, and so mitigate
the mischief. There was not so much objection
to the inconvenience falling upon the heads of
the aeronauts, but now that the aeronauts seem
| likely to fall on to the heads of the public, some-
thing should be done to put a stop to the
nuisance. We believe it is in contemplation to
give directions, that no balloon be allowed to
set down, or tumble down, within a mile of the
| Crystal Palace. Had that volatile daughter of
air, Mrs. GRAHAM, let out her grappling-irons,
the other day, upon the Exhibition, they would

A CONVERSATION AT THE EXHIBITION,
Between an anarious Mother and a Policeman.
“Good Policeman, tell me, pray,
Has my daughter pass'd this way?
You may know her by her bonnet,
Yellow shawl, and brooch upon it.
Far and near I’ve sought the girl;
I have lost her in the whirl:
Do you think she yonder goes,
Where the Crystal Fountain flows?”
“Ma’am,” says he, “on this here ground,
Whatsomdever's lost is found;
Rest quite heasy in your mind,
I your daughter soon will find!
Though she's got to forrin lands,
Hicy-burgs or Hegypt’s sands,
Still, depend on ’t, soon she goes
Where the Crystal Fountain flows!
“Perhaps Italian Hart attracts
Her, or them there flowers in wax.
Maybe she has got hup stairs
In among they heasy chairs;
And like GULLIVER is sleeping,
Where them Lillipushum’s creeping ;
But she’ll wake, and then she goes,
Where the Crystal Fountain flows!
“Yet, good Ma'am, I should explain,
She may stop a bit in Spain:
Smelling of them Porto snuffs,
Looking at the Turkish stuffs.
Or if warm, a Chiny fan,
Offer'd by the Tartar man,
Will refresh her as she goes
Where the Crystal Fountain flows!
“She may see the silver things,
Little watches, chains, and rings;
Or mayhap, Ma'am, she may stray
Where the Monster Horgans play;
Or the music of all sorts,
Great and small pyanny-forts,
May detain her as she goes
Where the Crystal Fountain flows!
“Or she may have gone in hope
Of a patent henvelope
To take home, and if she’s able,
Try to see the Roman table;
Or insists on one peep more
At the sparkling Kºi...,
Then, the chance is, on she goes
Where the Crystal Fountain flows!”
“Well, Policeman, certainly
You’re the man to have an eye
Over such a place as this, ...
And to find each º: Miss |
Pray, good man, my daughter tell,
When she hears them ring the bell,
I shall find her, if she goes.
Where the Crystal Fountain flows!”

The Softer Sex in Smalls.
THE revolution in female attire which
has commenced in America may extend to
this country. Well—no matter if the attri-
|butes of the husband are arrogated. . It
may be well that ladies should know what
| is to be continually having to put the
hand in the breeches-pocket.
AN AFFAIR OF HONOUR.
THE Hampshire Independent says that
LoRD John MANNERs has accepted the
Rev. Dr. M'NEILE's challenge to meet the
Rev. Canon in Liverpool for explanation on
the Papal question. This is the sort of chal-
lenge for Punch. How much more rational
to fight with canons than with pistols'
Mesmerism for the Member for
Lincoln.
IN order that he might see the Great Ex-
hibition sitting in his arm-chair, and so
without the danger of being mobbed, we
should recommend our Colon EL to be
magnetised with the view of becoming a

clairvoyance would consist in merely seeing
through his magnetiser.

as the declaration of the untruth, and since a man must commit either
the one transgression or the other, had he not better prefer, of the

A CHINESE PUZZLE.
WE confess the Chinese Lady, at the Chinese Collection, is a Chinese
Puzzle to us. We do not deny her Celestial beauty—nor do we deny
the smallness of her foot. Her singing, also, is as perfect as Chinese
singing can be; but we are puzzled as to the fact of her . “a lady
of quality.” We are told that she occupied a very fashionable position
at Canton, where she was the belle for one or two seasons. This is a
º to us. We cannot understand how “a Lady of Quality” can
end herself to a shilling exhibition. It is a mystery, which our total
ignorance of Chinese manners and customs does not enable us unfortu-
nately to fathom, how a “Lady of Quality” can leave the realms of
fashion in which she reigned supreme, to show herself as a curiosity in
a foreign capital, and be stared at “from 10 till dusk.”
self to be .. to Canton, and singing and playing on the Piano, and
dancing, and s
of China.
There is no doubt an English Collection would be as attractive in the
Celestial Empire as the Chinese Collection is amongst us—but still we
doubt if it could boast of so great a curiosity as a “Lady, of Quality
from Belgravia,” occupying the largest line in its bills. “The LADy
ANN ELIZABETH Blooms.BURY, of Gower Street, London—the English
Beauty, with the largest foot in the world—will be in attendance, and
will eat a hot luncheon regularly every day at two o'clock.” Sugh an
announcement as the above in the Canton advertisements, could not
have surprised us more than the one of a “Lady of Quality,” which
figures in our daily papers in connexion with the Chinese Collection.
The only parallel instance we know of in English life, is that of BARON
NATHAN at Rosherville Gardens; and we advise the Baron to go to
Canton, and exhibit himself as “a British Nobleman.” If he were to
dance his celebrated “hornpipe amongst the tea-things,” it would
immediately be taken up as a compliment to the Celestial plant, and
his fortune, in such a tea-drinking community as China, would rapidly
be made; and who knows his representations of “The British Noble-
maa” would be just as true to the life as those of FI-FI-O-YU-NAU-TI-
TING are of a Chinese “Lady of Quality?”
Serve him Right—and Left!
An advertisement appeared on Wednesday last in the Times, ad-
dressed “To Those will.ING to serve ANother.” We understand
that the answers, which were very numerous, were all from Sheriffs'
officers, whose willingness to serve another, and another, if necessary,
there is no reason to dispute.
Chinese
fashionable life must be very different to ours, for we cannot conceive
an English Lady of Quality—a Patroness of ALMAcks'—allowing her;
owing her foot, at so much perhead, to the GoBEMOUCHEs

| AUCTION OF SOULS.—PULPIT AND HAMMER.
IN, the imperial salt-mines of SówáR, in º Hungary, “there is
one thing,” writes a traveller, “very remarkable: namely, a chapel
which may easily contain a hundred people cut in the rock-salt; with
an altar, pulpit, sacristy, chairs and forms, cut in the same rock.”
Now a church of salt-of salt in its º: the Church of
England; and yet the auctioneer will now then usurp the place of
the parson; and sometimes, the pulpit will resound with the hammer
of the rostrum. The custom is to be deplored; for may it not, in light
and ºpertº minds, deprive the salt of somewhat of its orthodox
savour?, When souls are made a matter of auction, the charge of the
aforesaid immortal essences loses a trifle of its divinity. The shepherd
undoubted right to sell them.
A few days ago certain Christian flocks were submitted to the
pastors; namely, to those happy shepherds who could best afford to
offer the highest price for the chattels. Not being present at the
ceremony, Punch does not pledge himself to the most, rigid, yerbal
accuracy in the report of the transaction; but no doubt the auctioneer
did his best in the disposal of the goods, after the approved method of
auctioneers in general. - -
“Gentlemen,” says the man with the hammer, “the next article

THE CHEMISTRY OF SLUSH.
EveRAL scientific gentlemen, accord-
£ ing to the Times, have been set to
work upon the great Water Ques-
tion, and have just now made their
formal report thereon, which con-
tains, a striking refutation of the
popular, belief that the donkey is
\ peculiarly nice as regards his drink.
\ It may occur to some of our read-
ers that this document might have
been published under the title of
“Pumps upon Water.” The Thames
is pronounced by these sages to be
uite weak of the nitrogen whereof,
if nitrogen can, in any of its combi-
nations, affect the nosº that stream
is obviously strong. They say that
it contains “animalculae” only
when they are in season; whence,
...the conclusion would be that it is
little worse for “infusoria” than it is for whitebait. Admitting it to
be, as “the main drain of a large and populous city,” full of corruption,
they assert that it possesses within itself the power of self-purification:
but they forget to notice the remarkable allegorical fact that the Thames
is exactly parallel to the British Senate. Cheap tailors are bad enough,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI 21
A SECOND JOURNEY ROUND THE WORLD.
F have read somewhere the
prºfoundremarkof a Gascon,
‘that there was no place
where so much was to be
seen as in the World.”
This profound remark has
| induced us to take a Second
| Journey round the World in
º Leicester Square, and the
Nº fºllowing are the valuable
ſº discoveries we have made.
| There are but mine fixed
inhabitants in the World.
These consist of one Check-
taker; four Guides, with
long wands; one Page, with
dazzling brightbuttons; one
Night-porter, to prevent any one setting the World on fire; and two
Charwomen, who, long before the World is stirring, put their scrubbing-
brushes round the World in quicker time than Ariel could put her
girdle round it. - - -
The language spoken by these inhabitants is a singular mixture of
English, Scotch, and Irish—the latter predominating very largely in
the mouths of the charwomen.
It is false to say that the Globe moves. We hope we shall not be
imprisoned for this new truth, as GALILEo was for his. We maintain
that the Earth does not move—and it is lucky it does not—or else the
Equestrian Statue, which is buried underneath in the centre of the
Globe, would come tumbling out of the top, and be smashing all the
World to pieces. As for the Rotation of the Earth, we were so.com.
pletely convinced of the fallacy, that we never tried a single experiment
to test the truth of it. The only rotation we witnessed was performed
by a drunken cabman, who could not find the entrance of the Earth,
and kept going round and round Leicester Square at least half-a-dozen
times before he could find it. -
The night and morning of MR. WYLD's Earth differ from our night
and morning, inasmuch as the morning, commences when the gas is
turned on, and night begins as soon as the gas is turned off, which is
just the reverse with the world we live in. -
At night a heavy dew falls upon the Earth from the watering-pot,
with which the Night-porter goes from floor to floor to sprinkle the
four quarters of the Globe; for, as there are four staircases inside
at equal distances, we suppose they are put up to represent the four
quarters of the Globe.
We discovered there was no morning, or day, on the Sunday, except-
ing when the porter left in charge turned on his bull's-eye to enable
him to read his, Sunday paper., With the exception of those brief
| glimpses of sunshine, universal darkness reigns upon the Earth from
Saturday night to Monday morning. -
The length of the day averages generally from “10 until dusk.” The
longest day is generally a wet one, when not a person, comes to visit
the exhibition—the shortest, when the tide of population runs in so
º º difficult for the Čheck taker to take the shillings suffi-
Clently quick.
The population of the World varies, a great deal. Sometimes it is
ſº sometimes less. The Census, however, is taken every evening
y the Treasurer who fetches away the money box. As many shillings
as are found in the box, so many persons have been in the World that
% The machine for taking, the Census resembles the toll-gate at
aterloo Bridge. It has one drawback, for it marks just the same for
bad money as for good. Now every bad shilling taken knocks a human
being off the Census. Consequently, if nothing but bad shillings were
taken, the Returns of the Population of the World, for that day, would
be exactly Nil—which would be too absurd even for MR. MALTHUs.
You travel round the Earth by degrees; for as the big staircase
inside is rather steep, you cannot get, through it for a minute. The
degrees of longitude are calculated in the easiest manner by a person
reckoning by his watch how long it takes different persons to reach the
summit of the Exhibition; but the degrees of latitude vary a great
deal, as it is found that one person, especially if he be a medical
student or an Irishman, will take so much more latitude than another.
MR. WYLD's Earth is nearer the Sun than our Earth by at least
150 feet—which, we believe, is the height of the building. This will
account for its being so much hotter at the North Pole than it is at the
Equator, or on the pavement in Leicester Square, There is no fear,
however, of MR. WYLD's Earth coming in contact with the Sun, any
sooner than our own—and su posing it does, it has the advantage, we
are told, of being fully insured in the Fire Office of that name.
... There are ñº. in MR, WYLD’s Globe as on ours; that is to say,
if you are at the South Pole, and we are walking over your head at the
North, you are our Antipodes—but then, we are not subject to the same
laws as the Antipodes of this Globe. For instance, if it is summer with
us, it is not winter with you. If we are strolling about in the broad
i. of noonday, you are not tumbling over each other in the pitchy
arkness of midnight. We bask in the same gas, we enjoy the same
stifling heat; neither do we walk, as we should be walking on this
Globe, with our feet directly opposite to your feet—which might be
very inconvenient for you, unless you had the faculty, peculiar to flies
and certain dwarfs, of walking along the ceiling without tumbling off.
MR. WYLD has shown a very great impartiality, we think, in extending,
in his Globe, the same advantages to both Antipodes—which is a
superiority over many exhibitions, where, finding yourself at the very
antipodes of intelligence
on your head or your heels.
rou hardly know whether you are standing
MR. Wyld's Globe has another immeasurable superiority, and that
is, a person can remain in it a whole day, and it will only cost him Qne
jº. When shall we be able to live in this World for a Shilling
a day
SHOOTING FOR THE POPE.
(See the Roman news in the Times of June 18.)
In Rome, some days ago,
There was done a glorious deed,
In the Place “del Popolo,”
Where two People's men did bleed
By the bullets of the French, free and brave,
To the PONTIFF who were lent
By their noble Government,
And their Roman brethren went
To enslave.
These mutineers had kicked
Against the lance that held them down,
Spurned the foot they should have licked,
As before the Papal Crown .
They abased themselves to earth with bated breath;
But instead, their fury rose, -
And they flew upon their foes;–
Should not fellows such as those
Die the death?
The leaders of the land,
Which is Priestcraft's present hope,
On his throne by the strong hand
Who uphold their Lord the Pope,
His Viceroy of this world whose realm is not,
Sat in judgment by the right
That’s identical with might,
And condemned each rebel wight
To be shot!
“Dulce et decorum est”
In a martyr's grave to lie;
Who would wish a death more blest
Than “propatrid mori f"
SARMONEI and SAVINI, can it be
That the muffled drum so drear
Told your sacrifice was near?
Sure, the Frenchmen played “Mourir
Powr la Patrie.”
The Gallic legions all
Sent a force the place to guard
Where the victims were to fall,
That a rescue might be barred,
And their balls in safety drill each Roman's heart,
Who, their fate to undergo,
And afford a public show,
Were brought, solemnly and slow,
n a Cart.
This was on the Twelfth of June;—
And forthwith their eyes were bound;
Their last words were spoken soon,
And their knees scarce touched the
When the muskets through the Papal P
And the Pope and all his crew,
And his subjects also, knew
His allies had shot those two,
by the clang ! .
All silently the crowd
From the scene of blood dispersed,
For their curses were not loud,
If internally they cursed;
But they meekly saw their soil—let us hope-
Drink that sanguinary drench,
Shed their liberty to quench,
Crying “Blessings on the French
- And the Pope l’”

PEACEl-A SKETCH
HOUSE OF CORRECTION FOR GENTLEFOLKS.
WHEN a person is convicted at a police-court of having been drunk
and disorderly, broken the peace and some one's head, or knocked an
individual’s teeth out; nay, sometimes when he has even caned a con-
stable, the rule, with few exceptions, is, that he is sentenced to the
option of fine or imprisonment. If he is a gentleman—that is, a
member of the Gentility—of course the fine is “ **'. and
off he walks or drives. But in case he is one of the Humility or
Mobility, not able to make the disbursement, he is forced to submit to
the more unpleasant alternative, and is removed in the van.
This is, practically, a very uneven-handed sort of justice. Durance
is durance; hard labour is hard labour. A fine, to those who do not
feel it, is less than a flea-bite. To mulct a rich man of five pounds, is
like flogging a fellow in armour, The needy offender, who has to choose
between forfeit and incarceration, is sure to suffer something. This
disproportion is obvious; and the magistrate now and then, in a spirit
of Rhadamanthine rigour and †. disregard of persons,
adjudges peace-breaking Gentility to the House of Correction. . .
n this sentence, however, there * still be º The justice
of justices is sometimes over-just. Total ruin of hopes and prospects
may result to the patrician, from a punishment which, in the plebeian's
case, would consist, simply, in so many days' or weeks' confinement
and tribulation.
The question, then, is, how to visit upon misdoers of the Gentility
the exact amount of suffering, inconvenience, or annoyance, due to their
demerits? For instance, how to treat persons of that class, for pelting
people, with broken eggs, precisely as any masty fellows ought to be
treated, and no worse? cent events have incited Mr. Punch to the
consideration of this difficulty, which he has settled, to his own satisfac.
tion, by a plan which he has devised of a Genteel Prison.
This Prison, as conceived and designed by Mr. Punch, is to be erected
in a locality to be named Warm Bath Fields. Cold baths, for the sake
of cleanliness, are provided in other prisons; but Punch would have the
Genteel Prison supplied with warm baths, out of consideration for the
more acute sensitiveness of skin, possessed, generally, by a class accus-
tomed to luxury. Each º. however, on entering the establish:
ment, should, with equitable rigour, be made to suffer the indignity of
immersion. In the same spirit of severity, fairly proportionate, the
chevelure of every new-comer should be submitted to the scissors. But

The prison-uniform of the gentlemen is to consist of a suit of plain
black, with white neckcloth. That of the ladies—for ladies, occasion-
ally, commit themselves, so as to deserve committal—should a
simple morning dress, without ornament. The former shall be employed
º compiling statistical tables for the use of Government; the hard
bour of the latter shall be crochet-work.
The diet shall be strictly confined to plain bread-and-butter, joints,
and vegetables; all drink more stimulating than tea or lemonade being
strictly interdicted. -
The Genteel Prison shall afford no indulgences whatever of a luxuri-
ous nature; but the cells shall be decently carpeted, and each furnished
with an arm-chair, a sofa, and such other accommodations as fashionable
habits render absolute necessaries of life.
The silent system, will be so far enforced, that no conversation
respecting races, balls, the Opera, or any other amusement, will be
allowed; nor will any political discussion be permitted among the
gentlemen; and any attempt at the †. of these regulations
will be visited by the seclusion of the offender in his own apartment.
Thus the chastisement received in the Genteel, House of Correction
will be rendered exactly equivalent to that endured in the Common
Bridewell, and will no longer involve that loss of caste by which impri.
sonment, when awarded to ... is now aggravated. The magis-
trates will give those delinquents whom they think a fine will not incon-
venience, a genteel week or ten days instead; which would doubtless
tend greatly to the discouragement of egg-throwing and other fashion-
able outrages. Mr. Punch offers his suggestion of a Genteel Prison,
as the solution of a problem of which he will venture to say “Quod
erat demonstrandum.”
“The Pope he leads a Happy Life.”
This line of the old song was touchingly illustrated at a late revel—
the festival of dedication—by the clergy of St. Barnabas; illustrated
by the following items:–
“The gross weight of the meat was upwards of 1,000 lbs., and there were 100 gallons
of ale, and port and sherry in abundance.”
Out of compliment to the Pope, the beef was, no doubt, bull-beef.

LONDON CHARIVARI.
Emotion of our Famenn Sibthorp on READING IN A Public Paint the
Paoposal that the Caystal Palace should REMAIN IN Hydr Park.
THE EGGS-EMPLARY HUSSARS AND LANCERS.
CERTAIN gallant officers of the 15th Hussars and 16th Lancers are, at
the present time, withstanding a tremendous siege. , They are sum-
moned by Justice to surrender; but they hold themselves impregnable
in their contempt of equity. It is enough for them—gallant fellows!—
that one HENRY FRAzER DIMsdale, a youth, should take his trial for
their common act of gallantry, when, on the Oaks Day, on their return
from Epsom, they added another achievement to the brilliant onslaughts
# #. British army, by pelting men, women, and children with
etid eggs. -
Young MR. DIMsDALE–“from a feeling of honour”—says his
counsel—
“Refused to give up the names of several officers belonging to the 15th Hussars and
the 16th Lancers, who were vastly his seniors, and who were the principals in the
cowardly and outrageous affair.”
This is, doubtless, very chivalrous on the part of MR. DIMSDALE;
but we must also pay a due tribute to the determination of those gallant
men, who, in defiance of every summons of generosity, continue to hold
themselves in a condition of siege; refusing to capitulate. “No
surrender” is the heroic motto that at the present hour surrounds, as
with a halo, the men who officer the 15th #. and 16th Lancers.
And even as in a warlike siege, in a real battle, where whole regiments
bear the shock of an attack, or make a terrible onslaught, even as then
the acquired glory is associated with the whole body, -so, at the
present hour, is every individual officer of the 15th and 16th an object of
peculiar interest, as ºf in the renown of the eggs of the glorious
Oaks. As gunpowder perfumes a whole corps, so does the odour of
those pelte º sweeten every such officer in the nostril of Public
Opinion. But then, what is Public Opinion in the serene and lofty
thoughts that elevate a military mess! What a poor, º squint-
eyed, pig-nosed, bandy “snob.” is Public Opinion, despised and laughed
at by the withering scorm of Lancers and Hussars'
Therefore, let young MR, DIMSpALE comfort himself as he may in
the Queen's Bench Prison, the while his companions in eggs, leave #.
—says his counsel—
“To bear the whole of the brunt and odium of the disgraceful offence, while they were
the principal actors, and never contributing one single shilling to the expenses aiready
incurred by MR. Dimsdals!”
They joined—these fine fellows—in firing the eggs—but since then
have permitted MR. DIMSDALE to pay his own and their shot... It is
one thing to find foul eggs, for the persons of women and children,
another to supply money—the sinews of law as of war—to barristers
and attorneys.
MR. PEAt, the army-saddler in Bond Street, may in like manner
contemplate the generosity and heroism of the picked officers of the 15th
and 16th. M.R. PEAT—guileless, trustful man l—on the day of the
Oaks, when the officers, with all their shell practice, were in the
hands of the vulgar and insolent people, peppered and reeking with
the shot of the assailants—MR. PEAT stood between the mob and
the officers. He-
“asked the gentlemen, if he pledged himself to b; accountable for them, they would
attend on the following day? and they all declared tuey would; and MR. DIMSDALE
was emong them. They did not appear.”
Doubtless, they were too modest; they, waived the solemnity of a
public triumph. The victors' car (the probable police van) they would
not mount. JoHN Collins gave it in evidence,—
“That on the evening of the Oaks day he was returning from Epsom, with his wife
and children, and on reaching Lower Tooting, he was pelted with eggs by the gentle-
men on a four-horse coach."
CoLLINs was, moreover, unmercifully whipped by these heroes in
the shell; whereupon, to appease the mob, MR. PEAT gave his word
for the appearance of the officers, in the confidence, of their pledge.
|MR.PEAT is forthcoming: the gallant 15th and 16th still hold themselves
º in their barracks. It should be enough for them that
youthful DIMSDALE has been consigned to the walls of the Queen's
Bench. DIMSDALE only breaks his egg to be put into a cage; but the
eaglets of the 15th and 16th crack their shells to soar above the world
|and the world's opinion.
May we suggest to the Horse Guards, that, in default of the surren-
der of the heroes, the respective flags of the 15th and 16th should hence-
“OAks, 1851.”
And as regiments, in their pacific march, have been headed, some by
an ostrich, some by an eléphant, some by a goat, so the gailant 16th
Lancers and 15th Hussars should, in memory of Epsom, have hence-
forth driven before them a certain number of cocks and hens.
PAXTON'S ATMOSPHERIC HOSPITAL.
“HERE comes another candidate for the Orange Grove.” This, says
BASIL HALL, is the frequent greeting given by the wags of Madeira to
the º: Englishman, who, with death, in his face, lands at
Funchal; the Orange Grove being the church-yard of the island.
MR. PAXTON.—if his plan of, what we venture to call, an Atmospheric
Hospital, be adopted—will deprive the jocose people of Madeira—an
island, no doubt, famous for fun as for fennel—of the time-honoured
jest. For MR; PAxton proposes to have Madeira in London; not to
import its sunlight in air-tight tin canisters—but to have a Madeira of
metropolitan manufacture.
At the late meeting in the matter of the projected Consumptive
Hospital in the East of London, MR. Paxton exhibited his design of a
Sanitarium, which secures to the patients the same atmosphere both in
winter and summer. MR. Paxton shows how London, in its worst
winter, may have its fogs filtered and warmed; how London smoke
may be purified into an atmosphere that shall feed and sustain the rarest
plants known to give out the test quantity of oxygen; such atmo-
sphere being continually supplied in its best freshness and purity to
replace that consumed by the lungs of the patient. This Atmospheric
Hospital will be constructed of glass; and, at a yery small additional
cost, make—in fact—a Madeira in Shoreditch or Whitechapel.
..Who, then, need land at Funchal, with the Orange Grove in the
distance? ...Who, delaying the time of departure from home and
friends, until the separation be almost inevitably, final—who will take
ship, when he may take a cab for a delicious climate *. It may no
longer be said, “Poor fellow, he went to die in Madeira; he is laid in
the Orange Grove,”, but, “He gave the fogs the slip, and though
feeding his lungs in the thick of London, he found º and strength
in PAxton’s Atmospheric Hospital.”
THE GREAT NEEDLE CASE.
THERE was a short discussion the other night in the House of
Commons, on what may be called the Great CLEOPATRA's Needle-case.
It seems that MEHMET ALI has given to the British nation the cele-
brated Needle of CLEOPATRA; but the Government, looking at the
Needle with an eye to economy, and coming directly to the point, have
decided that it would not pay to bring the affair home; and, indeed,
when we hear that it would cost several thousand pounds, we do not
wonder at the reluctance of the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER to
incur the responsibility. We certainly cannot advocate such an enormous
outlay for the transfer of the Needle to England, and we should suffer
severely from the pricks of conscience, if we were any party to sticking
it into the public to the frightful extent that would be required. . We
are rather surprised that the veteran economist, MR. HuME, who is
generally as sharp as a needle in all matters where the outlay of the
national money is concerned, should have departed, in this instance,
from his usual course; and should have been the first to recommend
our pinning ourselves to this Needle at an expense for carriage that is
quite fearful to contemplate.

PUNCH UPON PORTRAITS.
URING the present Season London
is determined to be cosmo-
}. in all things. The
ndustry of all Nations is
collected under PAxton's
in Hyde Park; the cookery
, of all Nations scents the air
} of Kensington; the mounte-
bankism of all Nations, is
jumping over garters, flying
through hoops, kicking its
infant family through the air,
or tying º, *H.
upon carpets, at the Hippo-
#. and Astley's, at Waux-
hall and Cremorne Gardens;
the Costumes of all Nations
enliven our streets ; the
penny-a-liners of all Nations
puzzle our newspaper read-
ers; undertakings to speak
the languages of all Nations
boldly assert themselves in our shop-windows; Excursion-trains of all
Nations alight, like locusts, upon Leicester Square (not to eat,every
green-thing, but to be eaten as green-things themselves); and last,
not least, the modern pictures of all Nations meet pleasantly, and for
the first time, in Lichfield House, St. James's Square, while the
lorious old masters of all Nations have their annual gathering in the
ritish Institution. -
That good will come of this multifarious rubbing of shoulders, we do
devoutly believe. In industry, in cookery, in hats, in coats, in pictures,
and in sculpture, in horse-riding and penny-a-lining, in street-orderin
and hotel-dealings, there is not one of us, nations of the nineteenth
century, but has a good deal to learn of some one or other of his
neighbours. " - -
As to pictures, now. The elder art of all nations, happily, we have
Poor as we are in the old original Pre-Raphaelites
RAPHAEL himself, and LEONARDO, and GIAN BELLINI, TITIAN, an
FRANCIA, LUIN1, Giorgio NE, and the CARAccis, CoRREGGIo and DEL
PIoMBO, CLAUDE, and the Poussins, REMBRANDT, and RuBENs, and
WANDYKE, the whole tribe of daguerreotypic Netherlanders, and tulip-
loving, salt-water Dutchmen, have long had their homes in, our private
galleries, more or less accessible to such fraction of the public as could
achieve, by any means, the honour of a private introduction, at first,
second, or third hand, to the gentleman-gaoler in charge. -
Every year, a draft of these illustrious captives is assembled in the
rooms of the British Institution, and allowed to receive the visits of
such friends and admirers as can apply the silver key that opens all
doors. This year is, as it deserved to be, especially favoured... .
Let me beg of you, my dear young friend and rising portrait-painter,
to walk in with me, for a few minutes' chat with the old worthies.
Don't blush, pray, nor be so long cleaning your boots... We can under-
stand your little awkwardness. Yes; it was a collection of villanous
daubs that your brother brushes lately sent in here; and you may
reasonably expect a wigging from those who now occupy the same
quarters more worthily. fººt mastery is ever indulgent. Come in, my
young friend, without apprehension. -
And first, my dear young portrait-painter, let me introduce you to
Holbein, here. This is CARDINAL Fish ER. Take a good gaze. The
CARDINAL will return you stare for stare; but the fixed sneer is not
meant for you...There—what do you say to this masterpiece of hard-
hitting, straightforward, determined mastery in portraiture?, Is there
any mistake about the man there? Is there any thought possible, while
looking at that picture, of anything but the man on the panel before
}. strong of purpose, ruthless of will, scornful of scruples, with a
old on his inferior clergy as firm as that gripe of the Cardinal's cap in
his hand * One doesn’t think of the dress, somehow, one doesn’t see
it, even; and there is no inkstand, no table, no chair, no pillar, no
curtain, -in short, not one of the indispensable requisites that go to
make up a Bishop upon canvass now-a-days.
And now shall we pass from grim and gaunt HolBEIN, to REM-
BRANDT, that master of the Black Art—magician whose spells were
light and shadow? I think, my dear, young friend, that in the dozen
heads by this master, to which I shall have the pleasure of presenting
you, there is rather a remarkable absence of manner. It is curious, one
can always recognise the broad handling of our own DABSTER, R.A. One
never misses the same spot of light on the tip of every nose, the same
snuffy smear on every upper lip, the same Indian red-brown shadows
on one side of every face,—the same dashing landscape of every back-
ground. Whoever encounters a canvass from the hand of that elegant
eighteen acres of glass roof
first glance, “Ah, that's FLIMsy "-seeing in every frame FLIMsy
always, and his original never, except as quite an accessory. In fact,
one might almost fancy that our FLIMsys and DABSTERs turned their
Fºllº out by a patentP. as MR. BARRY multiplies decorations
or the New Houses of Parliament, growing a remarkably rich crop of
ornament at a curiously small expense of fancy-seed.
And now, with the performances of DABstER, FLIMsy, & Co., in
}. mind's, eye, look at these REMBRANDTs. Take that did man's
lead (contributed by LoRD Col.BoRNE), unwashed, the wear and tear
of rough life visible in every broad, coarse, commonplace feature of the
face, till, as you look at it, it grows into a living reality,+not by force
of anything remarkable in (i. man who sat for it, but by dint of the
resolute mental insight with which the painter conceived the personage
before him, and the daring mastery with which he dashed, and plastered,
and splashed the colours of that rugged and unlovely flesh upon the
canvass., Here is a pair from the same hand, the portrait of BURGo-
MASTER SIX, and his dainty wife, the friends and patrons of the painter,
as commonplace a couple of citizens as ever looked on at a frolic on the
ice, or received their friends to pipes, tea, and gingerbread in a lust-haus
overhanging a canal. But look how the painter has informed the phy-
siognomy of that sandy-haired, sandy-moustached, sandy-eyebrowed
burgher, in his plain black doublet and white band, by the play of light
upon face and hair! He has caught him bowing—for doubtless BUR-
GQMASTER Six was a polite man—either to a deputation or a customer.
His lady sits there placidly—to be admired; nothing remarkable in her
but her º and comely trimness in look and dress. What is it
makes these pictures so interesting?, Simply that they are visibly BUR-
GOMASTER Six and his wife, and nobody . Every feature in each
belongs to every other feature, and to all the features put together.
Each is a harmonious conception, and masterly, reproduction of the
original, and no other possible burgomaster and burgomaster's wife in
the wide world.
You agree with me, my young friend, I see. So let us pass to the
WANDYKEs, if you please. No wonder you come to a stand-still
before that portrait of SNYDERs. You are quite right. It is the
most gentlemanly portrait in the world. Even the elegant and accom-
plished FLIMSY never got upon canvass a more unmistakeable air
of good-breeding and refinement. But observe how utterly indifferent
is all in the picture, in comparison with the sad, somewhat sunken, but
still most sweet and serene face. That this should be the painter of
boar and wolf hunts, whose bold brush dashes in howling bear-cubs
and disembowelled º: and bristly porkers, struggling, and goring, and
gnashing in a ruck of hounds, by º side of which LANDSEER’s animals
subside into curled and combed drawing-room pets!
Those are rather a remarkable pair of full-lengths, I think, my young
friend, on either side the MABuse. Arts and arms, the gown and the
buff-coat, in quiet contrast,-the Spanish officer of VELAsquez, and the
ABBf ScAGLIA of WANDYKE; the former upright and sturdy, with his
leading staff in his hand, and his helmet by his side, ready to be braced
on, when the word is given to march at the head of those irresistible
pikemen against the breached redoubt, or into the grande ſº". upon
those rebellious burghers, who have hoisted the town flag on the
Beffroi, and are holding their frightened burgomaster prisoner in his
own Hôtel de Ville; the latter pale and rather drooping, but with eyes
full of thoughtfulness—the impersonation of subtle intellect, in whose
hands the brute force of the . is a tool.
Either these painters must, on the whole, have understood their
originals better than FLIMSY, DABstER, & Co. understand the crop of
red-coated generals, and black-coated clergymen, who yearly blossom
on the walls of the Royal Academy rooms, or the soldiers and clergy-
men of the days of VELAsquez and WANDYKE must have carried more
of their character and calling in their limbs and looks than their
respective brethren now-a-days.
Of course, my dear young friend, you jump at the latter alternative.
The fault is in the sitters, and not in those they sit to. Will you walk
with me into the South Room, and see the SIR Joshuas, hung here in
worthy neighbourhood with the works of REMBRANDT and WANDYKE,
HoLBEIN and RUBENs 2 -
Let me beg your attention to that sweet little Lady CAROLINE
HowARD–
al a rose
'Mong roses—mingled with her fragrant toil.”
Was, innocent girlhood ever better conceived, and more gracefully
ainted ? Or was boyhood ever better put upon canvass than in
ASTER HENRY BUNBURY-staring open-eyed at SIR. Joshua, no
doubt—his hands upon his knees—a boy capable of any amount of tarts
and toffy, but a little gentleman withal:
Was all this in the sitter, think you? As if to beat you out of your
lines, my dear young friend, be good enough to give a passing glance
at those LAWRENCEs, at that staring and tea-boardy canvass of
MRs. ANGERSTEIN AND SON, for example; and, remembering that
Sir Thomas's sun rose as Sir Joshua's set, and that Šin Taoyºs
was the crack and Court portrait-painter of his time, more unmis-
and gentlemanly creature, FLIMsy, A.R.A., that he doesn't say, at the takeably popular among the fine ladies and fine gentlemen than even

DABster, R.A., or FLIMsy, A.R.A., now-a-days, be assured, that what
the picture is tº be, depends on what the artist is; that the work rises

the infernal gods, than to the fatal fortune which now wreathes with

THE SUN TO PUNCH.
“FRIEND Punch,-Don't start, that I write this upon your study
walls with my best diamond-pointed beam.
“Well, haven’t I done the handsome thing this summer of 1851?
Haven’t I sent a magnificent specimen of an English summer to the
Great Exhibition? Shall foreigners henceforth flout at your summer;

more than a rightful courtesy, be also pleasant to the allowable self-
esteem of your fellow-labourer, Mr. Punch,

Extraordinary Liberality in a Prelate.
THE Westmoreland Gazette has published the fact that the Bishop
of Durham has subscribed £15 towards an Independent chapel in
Newcastle-upon-Tyne. With the farthest intention possible from
ECCLESIASTICAL CROAKINGS.
On the motion of SIR BENJAMIN HALL we have another “blue book.”

their incomes should not come up to the mark, contrasts with the easy
nonchalance with which they pocket the difference when they happen to
be above it. The exertions ...ſºthe Secretary to make “things pleasant.”
is very commendable.
First among the croakers is poor DUNELM. He seems to have con-
tracted for Durham on a vacancy in 1836. He was then Bishop of
Chich Ester, with some £3500 a year; notwithstanding which, he cannot
come with this coaly see without a “clear unembarrassed income of
£8000.” “In the very numerous and large subscriptions and charities,”
he writes, “if I diminish one half, it may appear mean, and I must do
so, and yet incur a considerable outlay. For instance, the late Bishop
ve fifty pounds or guineas per annum to the sons of the Clergy here,
including what he gave to the Anniversary. I believe he gave the same
to the Newcastle Infirmary.”
It seems that it was first of all proposed that his Lordship should
have his clear unembarrassed cº". year, and pay over the surplus of
the See to the Commissioners. On second thoughts, however, they
negotiate for a fixed annual payment from the Bishop; and he thus
instructs his agent:
“I shall not object to any sum that they (the Commissioners) may
determine upon, not exceeding £12,000. Iconfess I think it ought not
to exceed £11,000. Ever since I have been compelled to think upon
this subject, it has appeared to meflo,000, under all the circumstances,
was a reasonable sum to pay.”
After such disinterested liberality, it is satisfactory to add that his
Lordship, after paying £11,200, had above £27,000—"pounds, not
guineas.”-last year for himself. Well done, DUNEEM
Poor Woncester has been done in his wood. “My predecessor,”
he writes, “having been induced by his pecuniary difficulties to cut
down every available stick of timber upon the Ecclesiastical Estates,”
amounting to £5000 in two-years; “by which excessive and illegal
fall the bishoprick is damnified to the extent of £600 a year” wants to
be allowed a set-off to that extent, the Commissioners having been cruel
enough to require him to reduce himself to his £5000 a year; though
as he º other Bishops are getting more than their fixe
incomes. “More, but not less,” seems to be their motto.
CHICHESTER has been done out of £500 a year. He expected £4500.
“It is not pleasing,” he says, “to compare his situation with that of any
other Bishop; but having learnt that the Bishop of Ripon has £4500,
he is compelled, in justice to himself, to press for more.” He says
“If Ripon is farther from London than Chichester, the expense of
living is less.” Dusº does not seem to have allowed for this in
his calculations.
Ripon has been desperately done. He has had to create an entire
new place-new pleasure-grounds, gardens, plantations, roads, walks,
fencing, draining, and hopes the Commissioners will assist him. Instead
of that, they reduce him £200 a year, hinting that it ought to be £400.
His º then sends the Secretary a balance-sheet, which he
pleasantly calls “Conscience v. Purse,” to show that he ought not to be
mulcted;—and as there the matter seemstorest, why, we will rest too—
feeling, as we must all do, that such extracts require no comment.
A CALL ON MIR. CANTELO.
CERTAIN “gentlemen” belonging to the 15th Hussars and the 16th
Lancers, who lately distinguished themselves in so eggs-traordinary a
manner, paid MR. CANTeLo's Hydro-Incubator, the other day, the
“honour” of a visit. It was observed that they wore shell-jackets, a
peculiarity in the uniform of those particular officers, prescribed, by
command, to commemorate their celebrated achievement at Tooting and
South Lambeth Gate. The gallant heroes appeared to take much
interest in the exhibition, evidently º: with wonder, as sources
of animal life, objects which they had hitherto been accustomed to view
principally in the light of ammunition. They requested that any eggs
on which MR. Cantelo's process might prove inoperative, might be
sent to their quarters.
Chemists and Druggists.
The Member for St. Alban's introduced a bill—afterwards withdrawn
until next Session-requiring an examination of chemists and druggists.
MR. BERNAL said—
“There were but too many persons employed as chemists' assistants who did not
comprehend the difference between oxalic acid and Epsom salts.”
We believe this to be true. We also believe that with better educa-
tion must come a better reward: that whereas many assistants at
present know not the difference between acids and salts, so do they
not now know the distinction between their own salaries and the wages

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE FEMALE STREET ORDERLIES.
E know of none, among the numerous
acts of utility, performed by ladies in
the present day, involving so much
cleansing the public, thoroughfares.
The length to which the fair sex i.
in the article of dress, is only to be
exceeded by the lengths to which they
go in rendering their dresses useful
to the whole community. Few, who
have not watched the elegantly-habited
female pedestrian passing through thick
and thin, to assist in sweeping the
London streets, can form any idea of
what she carries in her train when she sets the example we, have
alluded to. All that is required to render the ladies the efficient
and constant scavengers of the Metropolitan foot-pavements, is to
organise them into a body of female orderlies, and though, the City
Court of Sewers rejected MR. CochRANE's proposition to cleanse the
streets by means of his troop, the objection being, founded, chiefly.9n
the class to which its members belong—we have little doubt that the
services of the ladies, should they be tendered, would be accepted with
eagerness. ---- -
Since the commencement of the shilling days has admitted to the
Crystal Palace a majority of those belonging to a class who are self-
interested enough to study economy and personal cleanliness, the
building gets only on Saturdays the benefit of that thorough sweeping
which the five shilling classes are Fº to administer at the sacri-
fice of their dresses, and at the cost of accumulating about themselves
all the dust and dirt that would otherwise remain on the floor of the
Exhibition. Unfortunately, the fine-lady scavengers are chiefly among
those who consider the payment of five shillings necessary to protect
them from the contact of the vulgar; and they do not, therefore,
attend in large numbers on the .#. so that the only .# to
secure their scavenging services would be to have a second five shilling
day, when, released from the fear of all association with what some of
them would call the scum of the earth, they might take away all the
dust and dirt of the ground on their legs and petticoats.
THE CANTING CHANDLER.
(A New Version of an Old Story.)
To the CHANCELLOR of THE EXCHEQUER.
PARDON, SIR CHARLEs, if I relate a tale,
Which, certainly, is rather antiquated;
But statesmen like their wit a little stale:
Jokes that have been for some time celebrated
Always obtain the loudest cheers,
Both in the Commons and the Peers."
I take my narrative from good old Joe,
An author every Member ought to know.
A certain straight-haired Chandler, not at all
A credit to his trade, or his “connexion,”
Address'd his 'prentice thus, with nasal drawl: ,
“John,” snuffled this pretender to “Election,”
“John, hast thou water-ed the rum ?”—“I have
Dome,” said the tyro, “as thou hast commanded.”—
“Ah! very well,” pursued the saintly knave,
“And likewise hast thou the brown sugar sanded ?”—
The hopeful youth responded “Yea.”—
“And wetted the tobacco, eh?”—
“That have I also dome,” the lad declares.
“Then,” quoth the pious rogue, “come up to prayers!”
When jokers shall this story tell
From this time forward they'll do well
To add two points, required to make it good–
The canting Chandler's last demand
Was. “Hast thou chicoried the coffee?” and
'Twas “Then come up to prayers—for SIR CHARLEs WooD.”
Here We Go, Round and Round.
A LETTER in the Times states that there is, after all, nothing new in
the idea of CoIT's revolving pistol, there being one on the same prin-
ciple as old as the time of CHARLEs THE FIRST, in the British Museum.
If this is the case, the American revolver only comes round to the point
from which the other pistol started two hundred years ago; or, in
other words, CoLT has found a mare's nest.
LITERARY SAMPLES.
..WE notice a great improvement in the shop-windows of some of our
literary contemporaries. One of them, in Fleet Street, has displayed a
most miscellaneous stock of toys, haberdashery and perfumery. It
self-sacrifice, as the , practice adopted consists of Anti-Macassars, bottles of fau de Cologne, children's
by our fashionably-dressed women, of “tiddity-iddity” boots and shoes, ladies’ handkerchiefs, gentle-
men's braces, relieved here and there with bunches of peaches and
grapes made in the most tempting wax. The effect is very good, and
attracts many a passer-by to lookin at the window, whereafter stopping
for half-an-hour over a chess-board, wondering how ever it is possible
|for “White to win in three moves,” he rushes into the shop in despair,
to buy the number that contains the solution.
We think the idea is so excellent that it should be imitated by all the
|newspapers and periodicals of the day. We throw out, at random, the
following suggestions, which any of our contemporaries are welcome to,
if they think them worth adopting. They may pull in a customer
or two, besides being looked upon by the public as fair average
samples of the usual contents of the paper:—
A PROTECTIONIST NEwsPAPER should exhibit in its window a
DISTREssed FARMER. Care should be taken in selecting the very
leanest of that impoverished class; but to keep up a semblance of
appearances, the specimen selected should rather weigh under than
above DANIEL LAMBERT. The top-boots, corduroys, broad-brimmed
hat, should be of the most correct pattern, and, if possible, a jolly good
dinner should be continually smoking before him, with the customa
tankard of foaming ale, to enable him to enjoy his pipe after dinner. #
the tankard were sufficiently large, and no expense were spared in the
dinner, the readers of the newspaper would not fail to imbibe a proper
notion of the terrible state the łºś. FARMER was reduced to, and
the tableau rivant would conjure up before his mind a truer picture of
the agricultural wants and necessities than any amount of Leaders upon
the same subject.
A SportING Journal might have a small stable fitted up in a window
—where the “Favourite” of the approaching race might be on view
for so many hours a day; or better still, the stick, or stone, that broke
the poor Reporter's head, when he was busy reporting the “Grand Mill
for the Championship of England.” could belaid out on a velvet cushion
for the admiration of all lovers of Fair Play, together with a copy of the
Doctor's bill, for mending the same, broken head, in order to give the
public a notion of the liberality of the paper. “The Champion before
. after the Fight,” might also form, once a year, a very attractive
object.
A GARDENING PAPER might show us a few of the “Enormous
ºrie ” and Cabbages which we never see anywhere but in
print.
A LITERARY REVIEW could show us an AEsthetical Contributor
writing an aesthetical article, in a purely aesthetical spirit; and a
MEDICAL Journal could not do better than lay before the public the
yarious noisome ingredients of adulteration that, upon analysis, had
been found to assist in a pound of the Best Mocha.
The PRoyncIAL PAPERs should have a stock of wonders perpetually
on yiew, which might be remitted to London as their attraction began
to fade in the eyes of country subscribers, in order to feast those of
Metropolitan readers. Thus, we should have an opportunity of
witnessing for ourselves those wonderful phenomena which are so often
read of in the country º: but never, by any accident, met with in
our rambles, through Nature. Each separate wonder should be
labelled, and the identical paragraph that eulogised its incredible
º or attributes should be conspicuously displayed underneath.
n this manner we should see exhibited “This Extraordinary
SHoweR OF FROGs,” from the Tipperary Moderator, lying by the side of
“A WonDERFUL TAKE of SALMoN ?” that had been sent up by the
Aſana Cat. Country º would compete with each other, in contri-
buting the most startling º: and, after a time, a paper like
the Morning Herald (or rather like what it used to be in its palmy days
of Gobemoucherie) would be able to collect a Museum #. ...i
make BARNUM leap over the Falls of Niagara (in his own exhibition)
from sheer despair.
But the great advantage of these shop-window exhibitions, after all
would be to convince incredulous readers that the vegetable and
other wonders which they read of from week to week, did not sprout
out of a Penny-a-liner's prolific imagination, but had really grown and
flourished in some less fabulous soil. If we read of a “Sheep with ten
legs and two tails,” we should all of us be too inclined to doubt it;
but where is the man who could refuse to swallow the sheep if he saw
it in a shop-window, and was enabled to count the legs and tails for
himself?
And what great phenomenon should Punch exhibit? Why, nothing
but his weekly number. Admiring millions see it every week, and are
happy and content, knowing too well that it would be impossible for
Punch to show them any greater Wonder!

“SIR,--The Hansoms of the present day are nothing to what the
used to be. I had a whole day’s º: lately in a Hansom Ca
in Epping Forest; so I think I can tell what there is in a Hansom, and
what there isn't.
“FIRST of all, there isn't room enough. They are not built wider than
an arm-chair. Formerly a Hansom would hold two º but now,
if two persons wish to ride together, they must each take a separate
Hansom.
“Secondly, the entrance is not high enough...You can't get in
without knocking your hat, and it is the same if you wish to get
out.
“THIRDLY, the roof is not high enough. You cannot sit inside with
your hat on, unless you wish to have it jolted over your face till the
rim rests on your shoulders. To save your hat, you take it off, and
the consequence is you catch cold.
“Fourth LY, the splashboardis not strong enough. As a general rule,
I have found that Hansom horses are more given to kicking than any
other breed of cab-horse. I have sat behind Hansom horses that have
kicked through everything. I can assure you, Sir, that the worst thing
that you can have flying in your face (next to your wife),
horse's legs. I have been for two hours in that awful predicament—
curled up in the corner of a Hansom, with no possibility of getting
out, and afraid to move lest my nose—which, from its extreme length,
is particularly, unadapted, for Hansom, travelling—should come in
contact with a big hoof...They say it is lucky to fling an old shoe after
One on a º: but still I do not like a horse to be the person to
fling it, especially when you are sitting not the distance of the hair of
a whisker behind him. -
“FIFTHLY, the present race of Hansoms jolt too much. You not only
have your swing for your money in one of them, but rather too much of
a swing. You are knocked like a ball from side to side. If you were
not wedged in so tight, from the narrowness of the seat, you would be
bruised all over, like a bushel of MARY WELDAKE's oats.
“And Lastly; I mean to say it is very un-hansom treatment to be
pinched for room; to have your hat injured; to be knocked about like
a cricket-ball; to sit in peril of losing all your teeth; to be jolted up
and down, as if you were in a churn; and then to be expected to pay
double fare—for no Hansom cabman is contented unless you pay him
twice as much as any ordinary cabman.
“ Unless the above nuisances are remedied, I shall be driven to ride in
that infernal machine called ‘BLAthen ANskATINski's Patent”—which
looks like a cab-stand of Hansom's that had been jammed up all together
—I may be stared at, but, at all events, I shall be safe.

MESMERISM AT THE CUSTOM HOUSE.
To DR. WILLIAM GREGoRy, F.R.S.E., &c., Professor of Chemistry in
the University of Edinburgh.
LEARNED SIR, - -
A LApy, under the signature of “D.” writes to the Times to
complain of the treatment which some packages of hers received in
assing through the Custom House. She declares that her boxes had
en broken open, although she had sent the keys; and her clothes and
other property thrown about as if they had been wholly worthless, and
then forced back into the boxes in a confused state, and covered with
the dirt of the warehouse-floor. Her dresses were valuable; none of her
property was chargeable with duty; and for having had it thus
scandalously damaged, she was forced to º £4.13s. . -
In your lately published “Letters to a Candid Inquirer on Animal
Magnetism,” which I take to be addressed exclusively to myself, who
am the only individual that inquires candidly into anything, you state
that MAJon Buckley—you ... . produced in upwards of 140
persons a degree of clairvoyance enabling them to read, with almost
invariable accuracy, printed mottoes enclosed in boxes or nutshells.
Do you think MAJoR BuckLEY could magnetise the Custom House
officials, so as to give them the ability to see inside of trunks? You
have yourself known some persons in a state of “lucidity,” you say,
describe, the interior of the human trunk. If it is in the power of the
gallant MAJort to develop this faculty in the persons in question, it is
desirable that he should º employed by Government to enable them to
ascertain the contents of ladies' boxes, without rummaging the boxes
and spoiling the things. But I am afraid that, in order to obtain clair-
voyance, the MAJoR would require subjects with a much more delicate
system than that of Custom House officers.
I am, Learned Sir, your recent reader,
33&hºcº.
SPIRIT OF EXCHANGE.
ERTAIN newspapers adºpt the system
amongst each other of “exchanging.”
This does not consist with copies of
papers only, but frequently with long
articles and reports—though the ex-
change is too often all upon one side;
for we * *::: of ours
repeate taken by news rs,
º their giving us the º:
chance of taking one in return. We
have been told of a person who is
so fond of “exchanging,” that he
carries it out on every possible oc-
casion. If he goes to a public
dinner, and finds his name at the
bottom of the room, he does not in
the least scruple to “exchange” it
- with one at the very top. If he is
travelling with a large party, and has a bad bed allotted to him, he
never hesitates a minute in “exchanging” it with a friend who has a
good one. If at a picnic he meets with anyone who has a silk
umbrella, he is always too ready to “exchange” his cotton one for
it. Again, if three persons, of whom he is one, are walking in a
pouring shower under one umbrella, he will not wait to be asked, but
with the greatest willingness will “exchange” his place outside the
umbrella for the one in the middle. He has been known to “ exchange”
the leg of a beautiful fowl for a liver-wing; and even to pass his ice
pudding on to the young lady sitting next to him, if there was only
‘a bit of game” to be got in “exchange.”
Nor do his “exchanges” stop here—for at an evening-party he never
misses leaving his old hat behind him, and exchanging it, if he is
reduced to it, with a better one. Nor is this all—for it is reall
believed, that, if he met with a handsome, amiable young lady, º
to the nobility, with something like £10,000 a year settled upon her
and perhaps as much more at the death of an old aunt, he would
not object, if it was agreeable to her, to exchange names with her, and
to let her take his name simply in exchange for her property.
More Papal Bishops.
The Porº, is manufacturing English bishops as fast as they make
buttons at Birmingham. He has, within a fortnight, made a Bishop of
Plymouth—a Bishop of Southwark—a Bishop of Saſſorth—a Bishop of
Shrewsbury, and so forth. They will, we hear, enter upon the full
enjoyment of their dignities when the following other primates take
pºssessiºn of their sees; namely, the Bishop of the Moon—the Bishop
of the Dogstar-the Bishop of the Great Bear, and the Bishop of
Saturn and his Ring.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON C
HAR1VARI. 31
HYPERBOLES OF THE HOLY SEE.
Is the late papal “Appeal to the Piety, and Charity of Italians,” urging them
to subscribe to the erection of a new grand Roman Catholic Church “in the centre
of London, in a fine position, in one of the most majestic streets in the City,” it is
declared that
“Those conversions to Catholicism, so frequent and remarkable; that necessity which, in the present
day, Protestants feel for instruction in Catholic concerns; those efforts which the ministers of error are
now making to stop the spontaneous impulse of the nation towards the truth, are strong reasons for conceiving
the sweetest hopes of the immediate return of that prodigal daughter within the bosom of its afflicted
mother, the Roman Church.”
FERDINAND MINUcci, also, “ARCHBIshop of FLORENCE, of the Holiness of our
Lord (1) Pope Pius IX., Domestic Prelate, Assistant Bishop of the Pontifical Throne,
Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit,
under the title of St. Joseph’—and Punch doesn't know what else—in his “notifica:
tion” on the same subject, headed with the unworldly and unpretending titles just
uoted, talks of “the happy success of the Catholic Apostleship in the United
ingdom of Great Britain;" of “the numerous restorations to the bosom of the
true Roman Church, not only of the unlearned, of the simple, and of the poor,
but especially of the most enlightened, of the most learned, and of the most
honoured personages; ” expresses, likewise, “the sweet hope” of Great Britain's
speedy conversion to Popery, and asserts “the marvellous tendency of that nation
towards Catholicism.”
Did you ever, reader, meet with the like of this? Why, yes; for of course you read
Shakspeare as well as Punch. In Richard the Third, Act III., Scene 7, you will
recollect Buckingham gives Gloster the following hopeful account of his attempt to enlist
the citizens of London in behalf of their design upon the Crown:-
“When he had done, some followers of mine own,
At lower end o' the hall, hurl’d up their caps,
And some ten voices cried, “God save KING RICHARD !’
And thus I took the vantage of those few:
*Thanks, gentle citizens and friends, quoth I;
‘This general applause, and cheerful shout,
Argues your wisdom, and your love to Richand.’”
What only makes the cases not precisely similar is, that whereas, when Buckingham
tried it on for Gloster, “the citizens were mum, said not a word,” and nobody
responded to his solicitations but a few of his own flunkies, a similar manoeuvre on
the part of CARDINAL WISEMAN in the cause of his chieſ, elicited a tremendous roar of
“No Popery l’’ all over the kingdom.
MINUCCI's assertion about the “numerous restorations” to his church, “especially
of the most enlightened, of the most learned, and ºf the most honºured personages,” is
really quite seasonable—it is so cool. Perhaps MINUccI seriously imagines that the
principal ornaments of the Bench, the Bar, the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons,
the Royal Institution, the Peerage, and Army and Navy, are the kind of persons who
have lately been turning papists. Punch hopes MINUcci has deceived himself-if not,
MINUcci has made a very bold attempt to deceive Punch.
The new place of worship to be built under the auspices of the Pope is to have its
site “in the centre of London in a fine position.” The centre of London is Smithfield,
and what position could be a finer one for the Church of QUEEN MARY }

A GAP IN THE GREAT EXHIBITION 1
THERE is, one great omission, in the British contributions to the industry of
humanity. . Among all our astonishing machinery, we have not one specimen, nor
even model, of the BENEvoleNT MACHINE. The reader, peradventure, says he has
never heard of such an invention. It is no invention, however; at least no modern one;
but he has heard of it often enough-under another, name. We exhibit machines
simply destructive; guns, pistols, artillery, shells, all kinds of devices intended to
smash, pierce, shatter, , mutilate, and kill, perhaps with horrible agonies, brave and
good men, or to dismiss bad ones—suddenly it may be—to such fate as may await them
elsewhere.
The Benevolent Machine, it is true, is associated also with, the idea of physical
suffering in connexion with the Great Čhange; but how much otherwise than muskets
field-pieces, and mortars! Its intention is—returning on the part of society good
for evil—to provide the vilest, the most atrocious
criminal, a passage to the realms of endless bliss. For
are we not told that almost every villain, who, by the
award of law, exchanges this world for the next, has
died devoutly penitent—brought, ‘by the exertions of
the reverend chaplain who attended him, to a due sense
of his awful situation?” Shall we be ashamed, then,
of the material instrument by which this great feat of
philanthropy—may of Christianity, if society canteth not
—is accomplished? Well, then, is it not either by an
unaccountable oversight, or by a wonderful inconsis-
tency, that, whilst there are plenty of fountains, there
is positively not one Drop in the Great Exhibition?

HOW TO GET ON IN THE ARMY.
veryone who considers the mat-
ter must see that the shortest
road to promotion in the British
Army is by way of the Conti-
ment. The best of it is, that the
º is not only very rapid,
ut the service extremely light;
for it is possible to take rank
whilst on half-pay, and, indeed,
in some cases, without having
held any commissionin the army.
The momentaretired lieutenant
finds himself in a continental
town, he can, if he pleases, ad-
vance himself to the highest
rank, without the sanction of
the Horse Guards being either
asked or required. The result
is, that Italy and France, as well
as other countries, are overrun with Generals, Major-Generals, Colonels,
and other military heroes; whose names, however, by some extraor-
dinary omission, are not to be found in the Army List.
| The same principle seems to apply to the advance of aristocracy,
among the English, abroad, many of whom become elevated in the most
extraordinary manner to Baronies and Earldoms, of which Burke and
DEBRETT, by some curious oversight, have failed to take cognisance.
It is also a remarkable fact, that the further of the º: may be, the
higher is their position in the Peerage. We should like to see all the
Lords called in occasionally, like the damaged sixpences, for we suspect
that in the latter case, as well as in the former, the spurious issue
frequently passes current for the genuine metal.
AN ITALIAN CHURCH IN LONDON.
THE Pope, considering us Londoners with the like, feelings of pit
and love that moved another Pope to compassionate the flaxen Britis
boys—the pink-cheeked, fair-haired pagans in the Roman market—has
resolved that a magnificent church shall be built in the very best part
of London. Whether Pro, NoNo resolves personally to lay the first
stone, or whether he will delegate that glory to CARDINAL Wise MAN,
we know not; but the decree is gone forth, and a church will be built;
a church to be governed “by a congregation of Italian secular priºts
founded at Rome, that the Roman spirit may influence the same.” We
are getting on: when may we expect IL BAMBINo to be carried in
state to Westminster?
. But Punch has to suggest to his old friend the Pope a plan by which
time may be saved. At the quickest, º months must elapse ere
the new Italian Church can be erected. Wherefore, then, not at once
purchase the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane? Certain we are that the
º empowered to sell would let the fabric go cheap-dog-cheap.
eally, the structure is worth his Holiness's notice; deserves the
Pope's eye. The scenery and machinery, pantomime tricks, and so
forth, with a very little expense, would be convertible to Papal uses;
and possession—we doubt not-obtained immediately. -
It is true that Drury Lane Theatre is not, according to the conditions
the city,” but it is, nevertheless, a magnificent fabric, and may no
doubt be had a bargain.
And whereas it has been by some contended that SHAKsPEARE was
at heart a true Catholic, let the Pope accept or make that fact, and
late. Drury Lane Theatre, once, become an Italian Church, be duly
dedicated to “SAN Gugliel Mo.”
“WENUS’S LOOKING-GLASS” IN THE WINTER GARDEN.
By all means convert, the Crystal Palace into a Winter Garden... If
you incur expenditure thereby, you will diminish consumption. What
an advan will such a place of resort afford to the out-patients of
Brompton Hospital! Here will be a morning's draught of Madeira
(air) in December, procurable, in a few minutes, by a phthisical patient
in arv mart of London. “Oh! this dreadful cough will be—ha, ha!—
cureu in a week.” MR. Paxton will then have built a conservatory, not
only for the industry of all nations, but for the health of our own
citizens. Well; but if this magnificent project is carried out, we
believe the boarding of the side aisles of the edifice will be removed,
and glass put in its place. In that case we suggest that the glass
ºft be coated on the outside with an amalgam of quicksilver. The
interior of it will then present a series of reflecting surfaces—in point
of fact, of ..". besides trees, and shrubs, and flowers, the
building will always afford agreeable objects of contemplation to ladies.

PROTECTION TO BARRISTERS.
WE understand that a League is in contemplation, under the title of
the Anti-Cheap-Law League, the object of which is to give protection
to the British barrister." Mr. Bºss has met Mºijº once
or twice at the latter's chambers, once or twice at his own, and on two
occasions, the two learned gentlemen have met each other half way—
on the staircase—with the view of talking over and arranging the pre-
liminaries of a League that is to give protection to the British ister.
MR. BRIEFless, in a speech of considerable force, addressed the
ºf. formed by his meeting MR, DuNUp on the stairs—and
pointed out the loss of dignity to the Bar which must arise from the
cheapening of that commodity, of which Westminster Hall had for
years enjoyed the happy monopoly.
R. DuNUP, in an eloquent burst of feeling, spoke of the disastrous
state of prices, and alluded to the fact that a suit which would have
once cost £40 was now to be disposed of for 40s.
MR. BRIEFLess read extracts from his fee-book for the last year,
consisting of not §." blanks, and payments, or rather liabilities, to
his clerk, while. ... DuNUP produced an immense sensation by
pulling out of his pocket, four (unsettled) bills for the last four years.
charges at the Robing Room. MR. BRIEFLEss then proposed, and
MR, DUNUP seconded the proposition, that an attempt should be m
to place the ruined barrister before the public in the same way as that
which had been adopted in calling general attention to the ruined
farmer-for it was the belief of both of the learned gentlemen that the
ruined lawyer would make quite as splendid a ruin in the public eye as
the ruined agriculturist.
It is a curious fact that in this as well as in other Protectionist
combinations, the principles of protection as applicable to the public
pocket, seem to be altogether lost sight of.
We may add, that MR, DUNUP, having been worried by his creditor's
little, accounts,” the learned gentleman has proceeded under the
“Winding-up Act.”

Church Intelligence.
It is said that the Bench of Bishops are so convinced by the reason-
ing of the MARQUEss of BLANDFord of the necessity of an addition to
their number, that they propose to form new bishoprics out of their
own funds. As thus: the Bishop of London will divide his income
with two other new bishops. We have heard of the corpulent person
who seemed “three single gentlemen rolled into one.” Well, we shall
have an episcopal unrolling; a single bishop of £30,000 a year unrolled
into three single bishops of £10,000 each.

England, for every one speak of him as My Mackintosh.
I must tell you, that Mac means “The Son of”—so, MacKINTosh, is the son of KINTosh-but I
scratch my head with wonder, for all the Scotchmen are Macs. Thus, Scotland must be a nation of all
sons, with not one single father amongst them! I leave with you, the enigma.
The Scotchmen also play, like children, with wheelbarrows—like our º: with village dances,
round poles with flowers—like our Professeurs of the Savate, with flinging their feet in the faces of both
other; and this they do just all as well as nous Français, qui ont porté ce noble jeu a la plus grande
hauteur, and have, with the agility of our feet, always put the noses of all nations out of its joint! ... They
likewise play and dance with the sword; but unlike ius, ma foi; for whenever a Frenchman take the
sword, c'est pour faire danser les autres.
Ef l'hospitalité Ecossaise P-I hear
you ask me. Ah! It was nobly sup-
rted. I was one of the invited to
olland House—the Palace of Lord
Hollas D, one of the most great Lords
of Scotland. Oh! I feast, and drink
in the conservatory, which was stream:
ing with light, all the night, and did
porter beaucoup de toasts to the health
of Scotland, and of everybody... Oh!
it was Une Nuit de Songe d’Eté, as
SHAKspeARE says—but what did please
me more than all the rest, I did dance
one Ruile with her LADY of Holland,
and the celebrated Host of our grand
Empereur by CANova did smile on your
humble feuilletoniste for so doing. But
what did make my blood mount to the
face, was that one blacquiard wanted
to persuade me it was not her Lady I
dance with, but her Lady's Maid.
Why am I a republican, if I no know
the Noblesse when I meet him * Infame
defamer, I did send him quickly to the
place where they do the Baggypipe.
All in all, I enjoy myself to a wonder
at the Scottish Fête, but it is a
thousand pities one must be wet
through before one can enjoy him.
The Crystal Palace Doomed.
No hope for, the Crystal Palace.
That brilliant bubble is blown out by
the breath of wisdom—that fairy fabric

an Alderman. solemn vestry of
Marylebone, SIR PETER LAURIE has
declar against a winter-garden.
Fragrant trees, and aromatic flowers

gether?
The world looked to SIR PETER

AWFUL OCCURRENCE AT AN EVENING PARTY.
THE TAX UPON ATTORNIES.
THE CHANCELLOR of THE ExchE-
QUER will not give up his tax upon
attormies. Like sportsmen, attornies
must still take out a license to bag
their game. This is very hard upon
the lawyers: because it is an admitted
fact pulsating in the heart of every man
who practically knows what law is,
that the tax comes out of the lawyer's
own pocket. It is a yearly offering
made by himself to the conscious
dignity of his profession; a matter of
personal enjoyment in no way con-
tributed to by his clients. In fact, the
parallel of sportsman and attorney is,
as we conceive, perfect. The sports-
- º º º . º:
2 . . . . is license to kill game: it would be
//// º absurd in him to expect of irrational
4 / * / hares and partridges to subscribe the
/4 º / amount of such purchased permission.
No, being licensed to kill, the sports-
man kills; and having killed, he eats
what "he has hit. The lawyer bein
licensed to practise, practises; an
having practised, eats what he has
blue-bagged. In both instances, the
game never pays its own powder-and-
shot—never.
----
The Bishop of Bristol and
Gloucester,
Bishop Monk has so ordered his
renewal of leases that, says the Daily
News, “just in proportion as his family
will profit after his decease, so will the
Church lose.” The Bishop, with such
an eye to excess, has earned an en-
larged title for his see. Henceforth,
instead of Bishop of GloucestER,
“My GooDNEss, EMILY! THEY’RE BEGINNING THE QUADRILLE, AND HERE's ALL My ‘BACK let all men read “Bishop of Double
HAIR” coming Down!! WHATEVER shALL I
Do?” GLoucestER.”
THE FORTHCOMING ECLIPSE.
EveRYBODY is in expectation of the Eclipse of the Sun which is
coming off, or, more properly, coming on, on the 28th instant. Stories
are in circulation of strange freaks performed on similar occasions by
the lower animals, who began to make a night of it under the influence of
delusion. For ourselves, we expect the following cognate phenomena:—
When the darkness begins, FLUEF will put on a dress “front,” and
stroll away towards the Casino. Finding that establishment shut, he
will think that “it must be infernally late,” and will go to bed. FLUFF's
boots will be visible in the open daylight, to the astonishment of the
first-floor, who patronise Mechanics’ Institutes soon afterwards.
PLUMBY will wander forth in a “wide-awake,” with a pipe, and being
met, as the obscuration clears off, by a respectable relative, will be cut
peremptorily. -
Members of Parliament will go down to the “House,” wonderin
how the time has flown so fast. A few will stare when they fin
nothing being done there: the majority, however, will find that, so
matural, from experience, as probably to go in and lounge there, while
the darkness lasts. . - -
A few Protectionists will attribute the .."; to the repeal of the
Corn Laws, and will watch it angrily through smoked glass—as they
do most things. . . -
Policemen, having lighted bulls'-eyes, will cast sheep's eyes in the
direction of favourite haunts.
Punch will make on the occasion various moral reflections; thus:-
The moon's darkening the earth by hiding the sun-results from the
littleness of the two first, not from that of the latter, luminary. Bear
this in mind, JooBLE, whose reputation gets between the reading public
and MILTON.
An ºr: is favourable to the observing of spots on the sun-as
people look at defects in the ruined ToMKINs, which they did not trouble
themselves with when ToMKINs was affluent.
Flowers sometimes shut up during an eclipse. So geniuses languish
when the figure of BLUBB, the critic, passes across the sky.
Eclipses are periodical, and Punch's periodical eclipses every periodical.
THE FIRE OF GENIUS.
AMONG the various inventions of the day, there is one that has
extremely puzzled us. e allude to a Pocket Stove, which is being
pretty extensively advertised. A man must be able to take it extremely
cool who can afford, to have a fire in his pocket; and, indeed, he can
never draw out his handkerchief or his purse without running the risk
of burning his fingers. Perhaps a pocket stove may be intended to keep
off the light-fingered gentry, who, if they attempt to pick, a pocket
furnished with a stove, would at once find themselves in hot coals,
instead of being thrown, } the more uncertain chances of detection,
into hot water. We should be glad to know which is the pocket in
which the stove is to be carried—whether in the waistcoat for the
purpose of warming the heart, or whether a stove should be carried in
all the pockets at once, with a view to the equal melting down of those
who are inclined—against their own inclination—to be corpulent.
With every respect for the inventor of such an article as a pocket
stove, we think the present is i. the time of year, or the sort of
weather, in which the public will be disposed to take up the stove with
much warmth—or, rather, the warmth, with which they would take it
up, if they touched it at all, would induce them to set it down again.
Wh. winter comes round, we shall be happy to fill our pockets with
as many stoves as the Life Insurance Offices will allow us to carry
about us, without increasing our *:::: on the ground of our lives
having become doubly and trebly hazardous.
“The Tvrant Customs.”
WHEN SHAKESPEARE spoke of the “tyrant Custom,” he could not have
foreshadowed our own system of Customs, which we are told by the
Board is anything but tyrannical. Qf course we are bound to believe
so high an authority, and indeed we have no objection to go so far as
to echo the good opinion the Board has of itself, and to invest their
Chairman, Sir Thomas FRE-MANTLE, with the mantle-or in other
words—the cloak—of justice.

A FORTUNATE ATTACHMENT.
PHELIA, a young lady, has
written to us in a deeply sen-
timental strain, complaining
of the reckless way in which
attachments are severed, and
new ones formed, by the
unromantic interference of
the Foreign Office. She calls
our attention to several para-
phs and announcements,
in which it, is stated, that
- certain gentlemen lately at-
- tached to So-and-so in one
- place, have been transferred, by LoRD PALMER-
ºr ston, and are now attached to So-and-so in quite
a different locality. The fair writer asks, in a
strain of tender indignation, “whether such a
sacred thing as an attachment is to be under
official control?”—and adds, that, “although
dynasties may fall, or ministries change, under the
baneful influence of politics, the man who is really and truly attached
should, at least, be *. to remain constant to his first attachment.”
|. We regret we have no consolation to offer our fair and indignant
friend; but we must plant another immense.barb in her already
lacerated bosom, by avowing to her our own opinion, that the parties
are all quite right, and that the persons whose attachments are altered,
simply change, as they have a right to do, because they can, pecuniarily
speaking, make a better thing of it. ---

Watkin, walkin, ladies and entlemen, and see the interestin’spec-
tacle of the United and Happy Family, showing the wonderful
of human hintelligence in subduin the ferocious and sanguinary dispº
sitions of the hanimal creation. Here you be'old'em livin' together in
peace and’armony, like so many industrious bees in a glass’ive; witch
celebrated hedifice was designed a-purpose for 'em, by that remarkable
talented indiwidgial, MR. Joseph Paxton.
Fust and foremost, in a central situation, yºu see that magnanimous
quadruped, the British Lion, a lookin', round about him, with a gum-
placent expression of countenance, him being ºn the best of terms bºth
with his-self and everybody helse, and feelin' perfectly satisfied in his
own mind that he is “monarch of all he surveys.”
Right over agin that noble hanimal you observe the Gallic Cock,
between witch creatures there has been supposed to exist a materal
henmity; but this is a wulgar error. The courageous bird has now
quitted his position, and strutted right in between the pors of the
Lion, witch, though naturally a carnivorous hanimal, is now, you per-
ceive, a-eatin a loaf of bread, made, I may remark, out of FreeTrade
corn. The Cock is pecking crumbs out of the Lion's mouth; witch
the generous quadruped no ways begrudges, seein’ as how he is blest
with an abundance, and can well afford to spare the small trifle.
* Not far from this amiable hexibition of fraternity, you see the
Roossian Bear, fabulously reported to have no bowels; a circumstance
disproved by his remarkable gentleness of disposition, and appetite for
plum-pudding; and there can be little doubt that 'tis to that salutary
change in his diet he is indebted for the wonderful improvement of his
temper. -- - - -
In the immediate neighbourwood of the Bear of Roosha, you be'old
the Haustrian and Prooshan Heagles, a-billin' like a pair of turtle.
doves, and it is probable they would be cooin' too; but that, owing to
a materal impediment in the construction of the wind-pipe, they are
unable to manage. - - - -
Here is a remarkable fine specimen of a London Terrier. The little
hanimalunder his nose is a Hanover Rat. There you have a splendid
Spanish Bull; a good deal more at home where he is, I warrant you,
than he would be in the Hamphitheayter at Madrid. There, alsº, is a
Roman hanimal of the same species, with a brace of British bulldogs
fast asleep alongside of him; may he never go further and fare wus!"
On the right is the Royal Bengal. Tiger, whose native ferocity has
been so completely conker'd that he is havin' a game, of leapfrog with
the Swiss Shammy. On the left, the Great Indian Elephant is amusin'
his self by feedin' the Chinese Pig with gingerbread nuts,
That large black-looking bird yonder is the Danish Raven; he has
got a Turkey Pullet under his wing. - - -- " --
Yonder-snug little friendly party is composed of the Rhinoceros

from the New World, and the Kangaroo from the Hantipodes. To
judge by their actions, they’re engaged in cheerful conve tion, arter

what they understands each other perfectly well. . -
Eastwards, in a elewated situation, werry conspicuous, you view a

THE NOBLE MILLER;
oa, NoboDY MINDs H.B.
THERE was a noble Miller, who
With no one could agree; .
He mid and sang his whole lifelong,
A slap-up Slasher he?
And all the burden of his song
Was, as they tell to me,
Oh! I'mind nobody, no, not I,
For mobody minds H. B."
This Miller was a learned Peer;
Not many such have we;
Full well he could expound the law,
*And justice could decree; "
But in a Mill was most at home,
For then he’d sing with glee—
Oh! I mind nobody, no, not I,
*For nobody minds H. B."
The Miller would with all set to,
No matter their degree, -
If in his measures they presume
eleast thing wrong to see."
Oned
ºfesang so hold and free-
Oh! I mind nobody, mo, not I,
For nobody minds H. B."
He sometimes proved the better man,
Sometimes the worse, a wee;
But, worse or better, never once
Was brought upon his knee; . .
And still would sing, though in his ear
He rather had a flea,
Oh! I mind nobody, no, not I,
For nobody minds H. B."
The Miller used, almost each night,
To mill with one J. C.:
Those mills have stopped, and no one knows
Thereason what can be. -
J.C. is Lord ChIEF Justice now;
- What’s that? says B. and W.:
Oh! I mind nobody, no, not I,
For nobody minds H. B.
When TRURotrod #. his corns,
His last grand mill had he:
He got the poor LoRD CHANCELLoR
Himself in Chancery:
And as he fibb'd him, still he sang,
Amid the sport and spree,
Oh! I mind nobody, no, not I,
*"And nobody minds H. B. :

ARISTOCRATIC SPORTS EXTRAORDINARY.
gº HE LORD CHAMBERLAIN, on the occa-
*** sidm of HER MAJESTY's state visits to
the Opera, has lately gone through his
- unique and interesting feat of walking
º backwards, up-stairs and down-stairs,
through the lobbies, and across the cor.
ridors," holding in his hands—during
the whole time occupied in the per-
formance— a pair of massive silver
candlesticks. The feat was ſº
in the usual clean and masterly style,
to the great admiration of all who wit.
hessed it. The Chamberlain went off
at a slapping pace, turning all the cor-
ners with his usual adroitness, and
taking the stairs, as pleasantly, as a
regularly-trained hunter would take a
hedge or a hurdle. We know of nothin
equal to this exploit since the splendi

backwards, six yards on his

and an acre on stilts, picking
up by the § & new-laid

three yards apart, and conclu-
; by throwing three somer-

to, the massive silver candlesticks. º, ... º. ºf
W. must confess that these feats, however well adapted to such
places as the Hippodrome, are in our opinión unsuited to the atmo-
sphere of a Court, and particularly a Court so distinguished as our own
for good sense and good feeling, as well as for the banishment of all
etiquette, save that which, without the humiliation of the subject, tends
to the dignity of the Sovereign. An excellent, proof of this good
sense, on the part of Royalty has just been shown in the expressed wish
o R MAJESTY, that the ceremony of presenting the Keys be
dispensed with on her entrance to the City. These now unmeaning
fooleries are well enough in a stage spectacle; but the QUEEN naturally
| feels averse to taking a part in such an absurdity as the presentation
º -
to her of a pair of property Gilt Keys, which fit no lock whatever. We
hope to see, as a further proof of going forwards in the same direction,
the necessity for the LoRD CHAMBERLAIN’s going backwards done
away with very speedily. - - -

* THE QUEEN’S HEAD-DRESS.
To His Grace the Duke of Richmond.
“My LoRD DUKE,
* “To you as the hope and pride of Protection—for the EARL
of DERby won't speak out; and MR. DisrAELI has a great deal too
much of what is called, wit really to feel for, anybody—to you, I
ess myself as a stanch Protectionist on a subject, delicate, I own
t no less a subject demanding the co-operative attention of every
ho would once again see wheat at 70s. per quarter. I allude,
ord Duke, to the head-dress worn by HER MAJESTY on her late
Avisit to the City. Here are dress and head-dress:
*HER Maresty wore a white satin dress, embroidered in gold, trimmed with gold,
silver, and white satin ribands, and richly ornamented with diamonds. The head-
dress was composed of poppies, golden oats and wheat-ears, ornamented with diamonds.’
| * “The QUEEN–Heaven bless her ſ—can do no wrong. But inas-
much as the Majesty of England is considered constitutionally infallible,
so is an English Ministry held peculiarly accountable for the nominal
acts of the Sovereign. Therefore, the country—which is the landed
interest, at º: heart and backbone of the nation—the country
expects of your Grace an immediate impeachment of the Ministry for
the insult insidiously offered to the Agricultural interest in the QUEEN’s
d-dress; for the cruel jest of which our Royal Mistress was made
the innocent and unconscious expression. . . . . . " *** -º-º-º-º:
“Your Grace is aware that that glass bubble blown in Hyde Park—
(I understand it is to be kept up as a garden to grow mutmegs, ginger,
and cinnamom at half-price, so let the grocers look to it)—was blown in

THE SCHOOLMASTER’s BEST ASSISTANTS.
WEAK is the schoolmaster, without the aid of certain ushers; and
these are Light, Soap, and Water. The EARL OF SHAFTEs BURY—pro-
moted to tº: of flords—takes with him his Ragged Scholars;
and in their tatters they do him at least as much honour as his robes o
velvet and ermine. It is well when the strawberry, leaves and the
leaves of the ragged primer go, thus together:* The Earh knows that
what the boy or girl ſearns at the Ragged School, theehild unlearns at
its Pigstye Home. In the houses of the poor, with five or six families
degraded by the communion forced upon them; the child, fresh from
the Ragged School, where he has been made to con'the theory of human
decency, l". at once into the practice of human debasement. What
lessons of goodness have passed through his ears; and what sights of
filth and abomination are nakedly Fººd to his eyes! -Theory with
its book, and Practice with its foul reality. What hope for the mocked
and confounded pupil?, Therefore, the noble Earl, confident in his pur-
pose, moves the second reading of the Íodging House Bill; and it is
read *...*. - ***, *,
e may, therefore, hope that in due season—the sooner still the
better—the ragged schoolmaster will be supported and assisted by
ushers heretofore almost unknown at the hearths of the veriest poor.
Light will be busy with its continued teaching; and Soap and Water
do their daily ministrations; and that to the partial discomfiture, it is
to be hoped, of fifty-seven millions, at present º; through the
land; and the more especially, pillaging the cupboards of the lowliest.
Gin, Tobacco, Beer, says MR. PoRTER, give to the Exchequer an annual
amount of fifty-seven millions of money ! Now Light, Soap, and
Water, arrayed against Gin and Tobacco, must have their victories.
They may not wholly defeat the forces of fire, and smoke; but there
can be no doubt that, with fair play, they will quench much alcoholic
flame, and clear into sunshine clouds of stupifying smother. ºr
We are to have Light for nothing... The fiat of the Exchequer has
gone forth-‘‘Let the sun shine gratis.” And Water—almost cheap
as Light—is promised to the people. Let the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchequER in his next Budget complete that work of cleanliness, next
attribute to holiness, and earn for himself an immortal statue. Not a
thing of marble, brass, or bronze, but a statue—to be honoured in
every household—a statue of Untaxed Soap ! * .
From such soap may be blown a bubble of reputation—a bubble that
shall endure longer than granite. tº
American Rifling.
AN ingenious correspondent in Notes and Queries, asks—
“Is there any one use for which an American rifle is to be preferred to an
English one?”
Punch makes, answer for his pleasant and useful contemporary, and
answers “Yes.” Since the decision of LoRD CAMPBELL, who, very
properly, will not suffer foreign visitors to be Bohned, cost free-the
American rifle is superior to the British one; inasmuch as, in the
. of the Yankee bookseller, it inevitably brings down the English
author. “ -
Flax v. Hemp.
ONE of the transparencies exhibited in Cheapside on the occasion
of the QUEEN’s visit to the City represented a crop of flax, with the
inscription, “Flax the Remedy of Ireland's Distress.” It is to be
hoped that this plant will prove more efficacious than a kindred one

PUNCH*S BULL AND INDULGENCES.
Punch, LXXXV, FLEET STREET.
FROM the first moment when we started in Wellington Street
Waterloo Bridge, and afterwards, when we removed to the Stran
opposite to St. º Church, after that, also, when, for the better
regulation of the affairs of the world, and especially of the City of
London, we fixed our seat at 85, Fleet Street, and from that blessed
and ever-memorable period until now, we have not ceased to devote
ourselves, with all the anxiety of our paternal heart, to the emancipation
of opinion, the promotion of civil and religious liberty, and the diffusion
of useful knowledge, as well inforeign countries as at home. For not only
did we, in verse and in prose, and by large or small woodcuts, always,
as occasion required, expose the erroneous designs of our own Ministers,
but we never hesitated to assail, both with pen and with pencil, foreign
Potentates, whenever they were guilty of tyrannous or unjust conduct
towards their own subjects., .We have, indeed, nothing so much at heart
as the progress of mankind in morality and true knowledge: in which
two things, the happiness of an intelligent being chiefly consists. Both
the experience of ages, and the opinions of the wisest men, attest the
truth that there is no greater auxiliary to the inculcation of virtuous
precepts, than instruction in the laws which govern the system of
nature, whereby it is rendered manifest, even to the most obtuse
understanding, that what is a man's duty, that, likewise, is his interest.
To disseminate this so-much-to-be-desired information, we are con-
vinced, by the undeniable evidence of a multitude of facts, that
Mechanics' Institutes contribute in no small measure. Seeing this,
and internally groaning, and, sighing, and grunting, in the most vehe:
ment manner, to behold the deplorably degraded, benighted, and
bestial state of Italy, and especially of Rome, whose inhabitants,
in as far as concerns, natural and political science, are for the most
part overspread with Cimmerian darkness, we, in the plenitude
of the license which we have assumed to interfere with, other
people's business, have determined, on mature reflection, and after
many grave.consultations with our Dog Toby, to decree the esta-
blishment of a Mechanics’, Institute in a central, situation, in a
fine. position, in the Eternal City. From the marvellous desire of the
Italian people for enlightenment, we entertain the sweetest hopes of
their conversion to the sublime principles of Newton, and the wise
and reasonable views of JEREMY BENTHAM; nor do we doubt that the
great truths of ADAM SMITH, if only due diligence shall have been used
in their propagation, will in no long time be received beyond the Alps.
In honour of the principal founder of modern philosophy, we ordain
that the new institution to be founded at Rome shall be called the
Baconian Mechanics' Institute; and that it may be the more thoroughl
actuated by the British spirit, we have settled that its Professors º
Lecturers shall be all Englishmen, and selected from among graduates
of the University of London, distinguished for their attainments in
º science, and remarkable for the liberality of their opinions in
politics and matters of faith. By these means, we confidently trust
that not only will the dark clouds of superstition which have
so, lºng, overshadowed the country of Italy be speedily dissi.
pated, but also... that the Italians, imbibing English ideas, will
in the end submit themselves entirely to the salutary influence and
control of England. As nothing in this world can be done without
a certain amount of money, and the execution of the proposed
laudable project will cost above six thousand pounds, we have
thought fit to appeal, hereby, to the benevolence and bounty of English-
men, and especially of those sojourning at Rome, and to exhort them to
contribute, according to their º to this glorious and patriotic
undertaking... And the more to stimulate the generosity of the affluent
to aid, with their pecuniary assistance, so desirable a scheme, we have
determined to unlock our aerial treasury, and accord to the bountiful
who, shall have subscribed towards the end in view, the following
indulgences. We grant * in a box at the Opera to any one,
on condition that he will stand on one leg and repeat Chrononhoton.
thologos three times, and Heautontimorumenos twice. We grant an
indulgence in a glass of brandy-and-water and a cigar every evening to
j one whose health shall permit him to enjoy it. And we grant an
indulgence in a hearty laugh to anybody who shall read his Holiness
The Poºk's last Bull. Given at our Qffice, in the Twenty-first Volume,

HERALDIG FRAGMENTS.
Nobody has a right to a “coat” who has never had a grant of one;
but many assume them on credit, or get credit for them, we should say,
on very questionable grounds.
When you marry an heiress, you quarter, the arms of her house—
when she has money, you quarter yourself in her house, likewise.
Various ugly animals are borne in Heraldry, as they are borne within
society—conventionally. For instance, a man may carry a “boar” about
with him, but then he is a recognised form of boar—as argent, or or—
aboar with money; *#. a respectable boar; or “in chief,” a well-
to-do eminent boar. He bears perhaps a “lion” in his field (or#.
but the “lion,” besides being a colourable one, is usually a saliant, or
leaping-up-in-the-world lion, and displays conspicuously a derter (that
is to say, dexterous) paw, or is couchant (snugly placed), or gardant,
taking care of himself, or otherwise in a º #. “position.” In
Heraldry, as in life, everything depends on a defined position. Every
“creature” is known by that; and, except in defined position, not
known or borne by anybody at all. A few years ago, as we all remember,
the Stag was seen everywhere—in very good coats indeed. The stag
trippant went about very gaily; the stag “displayed,” most houses
patronised: soon afterwards, however, the stag º his conventional
position—and was ruined. Astag pauperised is not known in Heraldry'
Animals, in parts, are used a good deal in Hº: thus a lion's
W, a ſº claw, may stand independently by themselves—the
onour lies in their being the parts of power. So in society, one is
tolerated for his satire; another for his head.
Be careful to distinguish, in describing “creatures,” their attitudes.
Thus a bird volant, is flying; regardant, looking towards you... For
example—if you should see a dun regardant, take very good care to be
volant directly! -
“Differences” in Heraldry, like differences in life, have their origin in
family matters. A difference is worn by a son to show his numerical
order in the family. Thus, a third son wears a “mollet” for his
difference; though many a younger son in life finds that a difference
leads to his having no mollet, mullet, or other fish, at all accessible.

The result of an Awful Engagement on the part of HER MAJEsty to
honour the City Ball with her presence.
In London, when folks' taste was low,
They used to like the Lord MAYor's Show;
But now 'tis voted very slow—
A dull affair, decidedly.
But London show’d another sight,
When the Queen came on Wednesday night,
Escorted, through a blaze of light,
To join the City revelry. i
At every window, smart º
sat Civic lass and Cockney blade;"
And all the populace hoorayed
To see the Royal pageantry.
Then shook St. Paul's, with shouting riven;
Then rush'd the steeds, up Cheapside driven'."
And still more stunning cheers were given.
By noisy British loyalty.
But noisier yet the crowd will grow,
Through King Street, as the Queen shall go
To Guildhall, there—on gouty toe-.
To see her hosts dance heavily.
The concourse thickens! Heroes brave,
Who flash the bull's eye on the knave,
Wave, Crushers, all your truncheons wave,
And charge them with the cavalry |
The Hall is gained; but, lo! what fun!
As to a ball, the Sovereign's done!
Except her suite, there’s room for none
To dance before HER Majesty.
Few, few can polk where many meet, 4
And have no space to kick their feet; -
The Hop a failure was, complete;
The Supper went off decently,

THE POPE'S ARMY.
. The Pope may laugh at Loan, John's Bill, and at the THEsigER
improvements of the same; for the Pope has an army fighting in the
very heart of England-fighting in the cause of Popery to i. confusion
of the English Church. § an English Bishop but is enrolled—
enrolled at his own banker's—in the Pope's service. y an
English Bishop who does not—it may be unconsciously—bring thou-
sands of mercenaries in aid of what he loves to denounce as the Scarlet
Harlot. ...And nevertheless he does her service, blindly battling for her
abominations. Here is one Bishop-let him wear the mitre whom the
mitre fits—one Prince of the Protestant Church; a Prince professing
the meekness and self-denial of the Christian state, who, in the course
of fourteen years, has received no less than £79,639.19s. 83d over his
salary; such annual salary—for the purchase of camel's hair, locusts, and
wild honey—being only eight thousand pounds per annum!
With the Pope invading us—invading and proselytizing—do not the
very Bishops fight for him? Unconsciously, no doubt: nevertheless,
every pound so retained by a Bishop is a mercenary on the side of his
Holiness. And this admitted, at this hour Pope Pius THE NINTH has
an army of hundreds of thousands, strong fighting for him—actively
battling-although, locked up in the coffers of Protestant Bishops.
. would advise them, with all speed, to disband such unhallowed
orces.

ROTTEN EGG THROWERS.
URELY there must be something very rotten,
besides rotten eggs, in the state of the army,
when we find it disgraced by such affairs as
have recently happened. Some persons,
calling themselves “officers and gentlemen,”
—though the term “an officer and a gentle-
man’” will soon fall into ridicule, or disuse,
if matters go on as they have done—are on
the point of being made to pay the penalty
of their cowardice and blackguardism in the
shape of a sound thrashing, about to be
administered by some of those who had
been assailed, when there is a general cry of
“Craven;" happening to recognise a
, , , , respectable London, tradesman, they take
advantage of his knowledge of them to entreat his protection, in saving
them from the just, but º become illegal, indignation of the public.
The respectable tradesman, whose word had weight with all who knew
him, and who, lugkily for the trembling “officers and gentlemen,” was
known to some of the by-standers, consented to pass his word for the
appearance of the “officers and gentlemen,” who had pledged their words
to him; and they were then permitted to sneak away, or get away as they
could, without any retaliatory violence having been inflicted upon them.
Having got out of their danger, the “officers and gentlemen” slip far
more easily out of their promise, and though they had pledged their
honour to MR. PEAT, they have left, until this day, the worthless
article, like an unredeemed pledge, on the hands of that gentleman.
Round robins have, it is said, been signed and addressed to the
colonels of certain regiments, declaring the determination of the
“officers and gentlemen” not to deal with MR. PEAt for saddlery,
because, when called upon to answer in a court of justice, he most
properly, and, indeed, unavoidably, put the saddle on the right horse,
or, taking a more charitable view of the juvenile egg-thrower, let us
* the right donkey. -
ow we do not for one moment entertain the idea that the
colonels, or the Commander-in-chief, would permit a piece of black-
guardism on a race-day to be consummated by a j of dastardly
mali º, which, in these days, at least, would be happily without a
parallel. - *
MR. PEAT has acted straightforwardly towards the public, and kindly
and considerately towards the egg-throwing “officers and gentlemen,”
whom he might, if he had chosen, have left to be dealt with by the
excited numbers who had been outraged by their disgusting violence.
It is true that the police would have protected ifiem, but it could
only have been by, their removal to the station:house, involving the
certainty of their appearance to answer those complaints for meeting
which, as their “honour only is, pledged, they evince no readiness.
Fortunately for the “officers and gentlemen”, involved in the egg-
throwing nastiness, the days of barbarism are quite gone by, and such
practices as these can exist only among a limited number of “gents”
of their own mental and moral calibre. If it were not for this happy
fact, we know of no offence that would so richly deserve the lear
talionis of the p"; - r
The stain of these eggs will, , we fear, stick to the army, if the
delinquents are not discovered and repudiated by the general jº
.. we are disposed to give the credit of being all that they ought

THE
REPEAL OF WINTER IN HYDE PARK.
"THE folks of Marylebone have been, as a body, the first to declare in
favour of a total repeal of the fogs, sleet, snow, and wind, of an English
winter; MR. Paxton having guaranteed the absence of the terriblººd
tyrant from, at least, eighteen acres of Hyde Park; where Eden may
be raised under the Crystal Palace, and kept in perennial bloom. The
City of London is expected very soon to speak upon the matter. The
civic taste for exotic turtle will—who can doubt it?—declare for
congenial orange-groves, and for other lemons than those to be found
in winter-time in certain mouths in the larders of certain taverns. . No
time is to be lost; for we understand that Colon EL SIBThorp is about
to present a petition declaratory of the vested rights of an English
winter, as shown, time out of mind, in coughs, colds, blue noses,
chilblains, and chapped fingers.

no objection, just by way of a treat. Since the Exhibition he has ta

from morning to might. He has let his beard grow as long as an ol
clothesman's, and #. moustaches too, which is particularly unpleasant;
and, to make himself look as much a fright as possible, he has his hair
cropped quite close to his head, like a prisoner, and is altogether such
an object that I am really quite ashamed of him. He has had his coat

jockets, #. a sawney's, half-way down; and he goes about with
lands in them, and a cigar in his mouth. Instead of a decent, respe e

really dirty: and, I must say, he does not § that attention to his

when I think upon it. When he does come home to dine, he generally
brings two or three of those foreigners with him that he has picked up
at that Exhibition, where he has learned to copy from them. He calls
this cementing the bonds of universal brotherhood;—it will come to
universal sisterhood next, I suppose; but that I never will stand, I am
determined. After they are gone I always sprinkle the floors, with

‘mon amie,’ instead of Sally, as he used; but he does not pay me
half so much attention, and is so taken up with the whole human
family, as he terms it, that he seems quite indifferent to his own. Dear

Really quite DREADful!"
A VISIT TO THE BRITISH CONSUL's
AT BOULOGNE.
(From our own Correspondent.)
THE demand for economy in our diplomatic establishments has been
promptly met at Boulogne-sur-Mer, if we are to judge by the arrange-
ments made to represent HER MAJESTY at the Passport-office of the
British Consulate on the port. The locality chosen has an air of
extreme cheapness, for it is flanked by the fish-market on one side, and
the hackney-carriage stand on the other; so that the Consular establish-
ment is within ear-shot of the language of the poissardes and the
quarrels of the fly-drivers, besides ºf within nose-shot of the articles
in which the former individuals deal. The establishment itself is upon a
scale which would afford the utmost delight to the lover of retrenchment,
though the concern is not of a nature to set the British bosom bound-
ing with national pride. At a small house, inscribed with the words
Fºrblanterie, Chaudronnerie, Poèlerie, Plomberie, or, in plain English,
Tin-ery, Saucepan-ery, Pot-ery, and Lead-ery, the British Consulate
occupies a room, which cannot be entered boldly from the front, but is
accessible only by going “round the corner,” where may be found the
Consul’s bell.
On opening the door, the traveller seeking “aid and protection,”
in the name of HER Majesty, finds himself in a dark entry, when
the noise he makes in tumbling about the passage will elicit a femelle
cry of “Walk up,” if his signals of distress happen to be heard.
The would-be protégée of the British Government having groped his
way up a narrow staircase, with a sharp turn in the middle, comes face
to face with a female, to whom the noise of the tumbling about serves
as a convenient summons, and who desires him to *Wº: in there.”
The traveller obeys the order, and enters an apartment sufficiently light
to show him that he has carried away a considerable quantity of white-
wash from the staircase wall of the establishment on his clothes. He is
now in the office of the Consulate, the furniture of which consists of
two rush-bottomed chairs, a very small deal table, and a sort of deal
box, elevated ". four articles resemblingbroom-handles, which serves
for the official desk.
The British traveller waits with due respect for the entrance of the
British Consul—the representative of the British Government, acting
in the name of HER. Majesty—when in runs an individual, whose
toilette is anything but soignée, and who wears a cloth cap, which is
probably glued, gummed, or otherwise fastened on to his head, and
exclaims—"Want a passport? Sit down here.”
A glance shows the º that he is not in presence of the
veritable British Consul; for the cry for cheapness and its conventional
companion has not yet led to the necessity, for reducing the repre-
sentative of the Government to the sort of article we have described.
Taking one from a number of documents in blank, but already
bearing the official signature which is to give it its validity, and is the
guarantee to the French Government that the bearer of the passport is
entitled to aid and protection, the individual in the immovable cloth
£º off a slice, and pushing it towards the stranger, exclaims—
“Write your name there.” The ceremony is performed. The stranger
writes his own name, if convenient, or anybody else’s name, if he pre-
fers it. The name given is inserted in the passport, which is handed
over, with a demand for 5 francs, 14 sous.
The printed form ſº for certain particulars, as to hair, whiskers,
eyes, and nose, the description of which used to be thought a complete
precaution against fraud; but since hair-dye has enabled every swindler
to travel under false colours, the colour usually devoted to the taille,
nez, front, bouche, visage, cheveua, &c., is left in a state of blank
ambiguity.
It is difficult for the º: to resist an exclamation of, “What a
farce this is " Upon which the deputy deputy-representative of the
British Government will probably observe, with a sudden sense of the
dignity of his occupation, “Oh, no! it’s very necessary; the roads
wouldn't be safe without it. There’d be all sorts of characters goin
about.” It is probable the stranger will not argue the question wit
the man in the immovable cloth cap; but it will not require much con-
sideration to arrive at the conclusion, that a passport, signed in blank,
to be delivered by an underling to anybody who chooses to give a
name, and 4s. 6d., cannot protect the roads from any bad characters
whatever. We do not join to the full extent, with the economists in
crying out for the curtailment of useful expenditure, but we do object to
the system of eking out the pay of a Consul by imposing a fee of 4s. 6d.
on such a miserable mockery as the obtaining a passport at Boulogne.
We do not say that the British Consulis, or is not, overpaid; but we
do say, that it ought not to be necessary to keep on foot the wretched
one-pair front over the fish-stalls at the Saucepan-ery, Pot-ery, &c., &c.,
for the purpose of getting the four-and-sixpences out of the pockets of
the British º: to Paris. If the Consuls are to be paid, or
º paid, by a tax on travellers, it might be all fair enough; but
et the tax be claimed in a straightforward manner, and not in the name
of as gross a piece of humbug as ever was gone through in the name of
constituted authority.
One of Lord PALMERston's reasons for paying a sufficient sum for
the diplomatic service, is the necessity for hospitality to Englishmen
abroad; but the arrangements at the consular establishment on the
Boulogne port, with its two rush-bottomed chairs and little deal table,
are anything but hospitable in their external character...We must do
the Consulate the justice to say, that the chief establishment in a
distant and inconvenient part of the town is sufficiently imposing for a
consular residence; but to the traveller who sees nothing of the repre-
sentative of the British Government beyond what he finds at the
Tin-ery, sº and Pot-ery over the fish-stalls and the #.
will feel that the dignity of the crown, descending through seve
deputies to the immovable cloth cap on the head of a not very distingué
§. in less than demi-toilette, is rather poorly provided for.
CAMPBELL’S PLEASURES OF HOPE.
(Rendered into Prose for the Erhibition.)
º: the constitution of the Crystal Palace is much too light ever
to last !
That it has not a frame that is not completely shattered!
That it has fresh panes breaking out every day !
That the air of Hyde Park is not sufficiently bracing for the girders!
That the body of the building is as delicate as that of a fashionable
young lady at the end of the season!
That one season, in fact, has regularly knocked it up!
That, above all, the building is much too beautiful—far too clever-
ever to live long !
That the idea of º it into a Winter Garden is a tremendous
Plant that never can flourish'
That a Winter Garden will only rear rheumatisms, coughs, and agues,
and can be nothing more than a huge hot-house for consumption!, , .
That unless young ladies are dressed in Divers' costumes of oil-skin
or º: they will be infallibly drenched to the skin—as has been
painfully proved to be the case with all the young ladies who frequent
the Jardin d'Hiver at Paris—everyone of whom has died inconsequence.
That, in order to prove the idea “will not hold water for a minute,”
it is highly necessary to pick as many, holes in it as possible—for it
is very clear that if the holes are only large enough, the rain will
come through, and by that means the concern may be eventually
swamped altogether -

THE GREAT DOWAGER QUESTION.—THE WINTER
GARDEN.
LAIN John CAMPBELL has made a
speech and presented a petition
against the 8. Palace as a
Crystal Winter Garden. Plain
John CAMPBELL–(after his
speech on the occasion, we should
rather call him highly-coloured
John)—assured the House of
Lords that the proposed garden
was objected to, not only by the
Dowager Countess of CLAREN-
DoN, but by—the sister of LoRD
Auckland! Great are Dowagers
and mighty the sisters of departed
Aucklands ! -
But there is more than this.
The Winter Garden was not ap-
proved of by-‘‘MR. Justice
CREsswell, a lawyer, a scholar,
and a gentleman l’”
The Dowagersmites the Crystal
Palace with her fan; the lawyer,
scholar, and gentleman hurls his
wig at it, and it is vanished—
ne like an exhalation | Tremen-
ous in its crushing effect is that
triplicity, “lawyer, scholar, and
gentleman l’”
Once upon a time there was a
conduit of sweet, crystalline
water, that gave health and com-
fort to a certain quarter of an
Eastern city. And suddenly, the
conduit ceased to run; and men
were begrimed and athirst.
And after a despairing time,
there was long and diligent search
made for the cause that had
stopped that flowing water; and
the cause was discovered to be an
old slipper, the cast-off property
of neither lawyer, scholar, nor gen-
tleman, but of an old muckworm, choking the main-pipe of the conduit.
Oh, people of England 1 shall a Dowager's fan—shall the wig of
lawyer, scholar, and gentleman, be permitted to choke up and destroy
your expectations of your Crystal Winter Garden?
TO BISHOPS OF NEGLECTED EDUCATION.
CoCKER, THE YouNGER, having opened a School of Arithmetic, in the
neighbourhood of Fulham, begs respectfully to address himself to the
Parents and Guardians of those Bishops whose apparent ignorance of
the First Principles of Arithmetic imparts to them a character of child-
like simplicity, in beautiful harmony with their mission, though—such
is the condition of a corrupt society—susceptible of the worst misre-
presentation by unscrupulous and unchristian men.
CockeR, THE YouNGER, is a lineal descendant of the Cocker, whose
name is immortalised in the hundreds of thousands of ledgers of this
great commercial and great shop-keeping nation. Therefore, it is with
a º: confidence, that—seeing the lamentable arithmetical mis-
takes committed for a series of years by certain dignitaries of the
Established Church–Cocker, the YouNGER, proposes to himself the
task of their Guide, Accountant, and Friend.
Extremes meet: an ignorance of arithmetic may be alike a distin-
guishing defect in the most benighted and savage as in the most pious
and . of men. It is well known that whole nations exist,
incapable of counting more than ten; that any higher number is ex-
pressed by a hopeless appeal to the hair of their heads. In like manner,
it has been proved that men may become so rapt and sublimated by the
continual contemplation and performance of their divine mission and
duties, that they are altogether at sea (or as it is sometimes spelt, see,)
in a matter of worldly figures. In the Romish Church, penance and
flagellation are often matters of wholesome self-discipline; and the Pro-
testant Bishop is not without his whip of thongs. Here it is:– .
“Multiplication is Vexation,
Division is as bad;
The Rule of Three doth Puzzle me,
And Practice drives me mad.”.
CockeR, THE YouNGER, ventures to analyze the emotions of a Bishop
of neglected Education, his brain ever haunted by this jingle; even as
we know a jig tune will, at times, possess itself of us whether we will
or not.
* Multiplication is Wexation.”
This truth the Bishop of some £30,000 per annum of accruing leases
acknowledges, with a groan that must tear the very sanctuary of his
heart. Wexation, indeed, in banked and hoarded treasures, which his
very simplicity permits him not to count!
* Division is as bad."
Quite as bad—or worse; and so the Uneducated Bishop cannot
bear to think of it.
“The Rule of Three doth Puzzle me.”
. The Rule of Number One being the rule predominant in Episcopal
Innocence.
“And Practice drives me mad."
Of course; and is therefore to be avoided, even as a rabid dog. For,
imagine a Bishop of £30,000 bitten by the Practice of Division!. In
his insanity he might shower about him all the results of his Multiplica-
tion! What a deluge of Loaves and Fishes!
In conclusion, Cocker, THE YouNGER, in dedicating himself to the
service and improvement of Bishops of Neglected Education, and con-
sequently in Embarrassed Circumstances—for their arithmetical mis-
takes have not tended to strengthen their credit with the country at
large—pledges himself to enable any pupil, in only three lessons, to
strike a just balance between his own allowed income (according to the
Ecclesiastical Commission,) and the sum due to the Commissioners.
CockeR, The YoUNGER, begs to assure all Parents and Guardians of
Bishops—for, considering Episcopal innocence in the ways of arithmetic,
he cannot look upon Bishops but as babes and sucklings—that every
attention will be given to their morals; especially to that morality
which is intimately connected with a just rendering of accounts.
Cocker, The YouNGER, proposes an early examination of his Pupils,
whom—he pledges himself to this—he undertakes to prepare for the
most satisfactory solution of the most difficult questions. (MR. HoRs-
MAN is invited to attend.) -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CONNUBIAL QUERY.
Sa woman, Mr. Punch, I should
hope that I am a constant
reader of what I consider to be
the most interesting part of
the newspaper; need I allude
to the Births—Marriages—an
Deaths?
“Well, Mr. Punch, I now
constantly see the names of the
clergymen, who tie the holy
knot, together with the names
of other clergymen, who are
said to “assist” at that blessed
ceremony.
“Now, Mr. Punch, this
brings me to what I took up
º my pen for, which is this.
When I was married to SIM-
cox -- (for I don't hesitate, why
should I? to give my name) — I
needn't say how many years ago, we
were married by only one clergyman,
not “assisted” at all by any other
clergyman soever, and we have both
of us—at least I will answer for my-
self-considered that knot as binding.
Still, when I see every day that it
now takes two clergymen to perform
holy matrimony, where before one
was considered quite enough, I can-
not but express my fears, that as
only one parson tied me and SIM cox
the knot may not be considere
quite so strong as when tied by a
couple. Are we, then, to consider
that with only one clergyman the
tie is single, but with two, the
tie's all the stronger, as it then
becomes a double knot? Yours, a little nervous,
Cupid Cottage. “EMMA SIMCox.”
“P.S.–I know you’ve interest with him... Could you get the Bishop
of Exeter to give us his opinion on the subject?”
PUNCH AMONG THE PENS.
THE Show-yard of the Royal Agricultural Society, in Windsor Home
Park, afforded Mr. Punch much food for contemplation in the beef,
mutton, and pork, which he there beheld, all alive and lowing, bleating,
squeaking, and grunting.
To discuss if: respective merits of Devons, Herefords, and Short-
horns, is peculiarly within the province of those whose talk is of oxen
—and therefore quite out of that of Mr. Punch. Soft-horns are the
only cattle on which he can expect that his observations would meet
with much attention.
There was one point, however, about the prize Fº and bulls, and,
indeed, the swine and horned animals generally, of which Mr. Punch
will venture to express his admiration. One human being, by the long-
continued habit of gazing on the countenance of another, sometimes
comes at last, it has been observed, to acquire that other's expression.
Now the pigs and the bulls—the fact was strikingly obvious—presented,
in their faces, as well as in their forms and contours, a wonderful
resemblance to a style of physiognomy very generally characteristic of
agricultural gentlemen. -
Did the animals contract it from eyeing the farmers, or the farmers
from contemplating the animals? #. that as it may, there was the
likeness. The bulls, particularly in the eye, showed a doggedness of will,
an unpersuadable bent, and a negation of fancy, the exact counterpart
of an aspect often observable among the British yeomanry. The same
traits were exhibited by the pigs, and were accompanied in them by an
appearance of distress aud discomfort, the result, indeed, of a plethoric
habit, but evincing a sense of suffering under persecution and wrong.
This sentiment was further expressed by a continual grunting and
squeaking in tones of angry complaint and indignation; which by no
means lessened the similitude. One great hog was making so frightful
a noise, that it might have been supposed that he was being scalded
alive: but he had stuffed his head into some litter, out of the way of
the sun, that he might go to sleep; and the uproar he was making was
occasioned by the attempt of a spectator to get him on his legs. He
seemed to have settled it that he was down, and could never rise again,
and to be exasperated by the attempt to convince him to the contrary.
Other members of the same family, of prodigious bulk, were stuffing
themselves, and at the same time groaning ºf...; as if for very
hunger, both as loud as they were able. In short, they were enjoying
their agricultural dinner. To complete the parallel, they were evidently
neither starving, nor likely to starve; and in the determination—
amounting, perhaps, to obstinacy—so strongly displayed, both in their
utterance and their, features, there was a correspondence to a qualit
which, doubtless, will bear another description of grumblers tº:
He saw the
d|their difficulties.
But did Mr. Punch observe no animals like himself?
Suffolk Punches.
There is one thing which is a certain promise of prosperity to the
Agricultural Society. Its exhibitors are terribly in earnest. A number
of gentlemen had gathered round an enormous bullock, and were
gauging its huge dimensions with their walking-sticks. This was done
as seriously as if they had been pagan priests, consulting over a victim
intended for sacrifice; nay, more so; for their looks betokened a reve-
rence for the object of their attention, which would not have been
shown by the heathen clergymen. Some labourers, leaning against a
ºf rail, and looking on, behaved with equal decorum. One
of them only cried out, “Halloa, MoRGIN 1" to which MorgiN replied
with an inarticulate noise, and a grin; and this was the only approach
to levity made by any of the party.
Several Frenchmen were present, exclaiming loudly with admiration,
and declaring they had never seen such beasts in their life—as the
cattle, they meant, of course.
Not a few fair damsels were also there, and Mr. Punch saw some of
them patting the pigs in a most affectionate manner; insomuch, that he
could almost have wished to be a pig himself. How delighted must
CoBBETT have been, if looking on in spirit, to see these sensible girls
improving their minds and exercising their limbs at a cattle-show,
instead of crawling about a fancy fair! The solid nature of the
refreshmen's provided for the visitors, consisting chiefly of pork-pies
and beer, instead of your wafers and ices, must also have gratified the
shade of that lover of the substantial.
By the performances of the agriculturists at the refreshment-shed,
as well as by their bodily condition, Punch was delighted to see that,
notwithstanding Free Trade, they are as great in consumption as in
production.
THE LIBERTY OF THE STAGE AT BERLIN.
PRussia would be justified in looking its Prussian-bluest at the
arrangements recently made for the theatres of Berlin. It is fortunate
for us that our actors borrow nothing but their gloves from that
country, for our stage could never exist under the conditions imposed
by the Prussian Government. -
In the first place, the actors are forbidden to introduce anything of
their own, or deviate from the authorised text. What would become
of all our farce actors, if this rule were applied here, and if every super-
fluous exclamation of “Believe you, my boy!” “Bricksey, Wicksey,
Picksey !” or other spontaneous ebullitions of humour, were to be pro-
hibited to the actor, whose notions of wit are completely dependent on
his having full liberty to say these things, or any other equally amusing
things, whenever they come into his head? In the case of all proces-
sions, the manager is to send to the authorities all the masks, banners,
and mottoes that are to be employed. We can fancy the censorship
gravely employed in perusing the fºur: of the masks intended for a
Christmas pantomime, with a view to ascertain whether sedition might
lurk in some goggle eye, whether treason may be curled up in some
monstrous ear, or want to inflict a decisive blow through some sus-
picious nose. The same regulation applies to ballets; and every dance
is to be described beforehand, lest the dancers should take some revolu-
tionary attitude. -
We should like to see a description of a sailor's hornpipe prepared
for the edification of the authorities, or the programme of a pas de deur
submitted to the deliberation of a Cabinet Council. We, think a
minister would be a little puzzled by some of the information he would
receive as to the number of skips, bounds, or shuffles, backwards,
forwards, or sideways; and he would hardly know how to decide
whether the movement intended would prove dangerous to the Slate.
The only way would be to summon the danseuses themselves before the
Government, who could then see exactly what no verbal description
could give an adequate idea of. It is almost impossible to imagine
such things occurring under our happy constitution; but for the
absurdity of the thing, we will suggest the possibility of Rosati,
CARLotta GRISI, or Marre TAGL10N1, being sent for, to Downing
Street to acquaint the Cabinet with the nature of their intended
new pas.

rush of Episcopal Corre-

indeed, if the letter-writing
of the Right Reverend Bench
is carried much further, the
columns of our respected con-
temporary will afford ample
specimens of the literary
styles of all our Bishops. We
have no objection to offer to
their Lordships becoming
contributors to the public
journals; and, indeed, it is
one of the most agreeable
signs of the Times to find the
position of the Press so
thoroughly acknowledged as
it is by the Right Reverend
portion of the Peerage. To
find the Bishops pleading at
the bar of Public Opinion—
in person, though certainly
not in formá pauperis—is a
prehensive one.

DEFEAT OF THE JEWS BY LORD NELSON.
) E have a NELson still who
altars; for the gallant and
reverend Earl ennobled by
Trafalgar has led the van
against the Hebrew host,
now thundering at the gates
of Parliament. The old shot-
pierced coat of NElson lies
a bit of moth-eaten woollen
in Greenwich Hospital; but
the indomitable will that
worked beneath it animates
and inspires the parson Earl
of the House of Lords.
Heroically beautiful was
NELson, “flaming on the quarter” of the Spanish three-decker; no
less “lovelily dreadful” was the Nelson still spared to us, boarding
the Synagogue! When shall his triumph be celebrated at Exeter Hall?
When shall white-robed virgins sing his praises—when shall rejoicing
elders chant his name? True it is—according to, our Nelson—that,
“the Legislature was not now bond ſide Christian.” And–
“The relations between the Church and the State had been greatly shaken by this
circumstance, and was it right to add to this source of danger at a time like the
present?”
No doubt of it: the relations have been shaken. There has been such
pushing and jostling by certain folks for thousands and tens of thousands
—all eager as scrambling boys for nuts—that the relations have been
shaken; the pillars of Church and State have somewhat rocked. And
then our NELSON thunders this question-
“If they admitted the Jews, where would they stop?" -
Where, indeed? THE EMPEROR OF CHINA—for º: best known
to himself—may swamp the House of Commons with flowery members
from the Flowery Country. The SULTAN–of course in collusion with
the traitorous PALMERston—may send a score of Mahometans–(think
of the fez in St. Stephen's')—for no other purpose than to beard
SIBTHoRP himself with their bigotry. Nay, the KING of DAHOMEY may
forward his Africans (a Colonel or two of his Amazonian Light Horse,
cunningly disguised for the occasion,) to advocate his own particular
interests in the slave trade.
“Where would they stop?”. How far-seeing, how profound, the
human interests involved in this question! And how comforting to
remember, that the time-hallowed query has never, been in abeyance!
The Ancient Briton, when he doubted of mere paint as his only wear,
was met by the awful interrogation of his more ancient countryman—
“What! dress in wolf-skins'ſ Where will you stop?” “Travel ten
miles an hour by railway, MR. STEPHENson | Bless us and save us!
Where will you stop?” “What! Cover eighteen acres of Hyde Park
with a skeleton of iron and a body of glass, that shall not be rolled up like
a scroll by the first gale of wind—shall not be broken to atoms by the
first storm of hail. Where, where, MR. PAxton, will you stop?”
It is a great comfort, a great conservative delight, to know that the
world—in its worst barrenness of great men—has ever a supply of
those sages endued with the unerring sagacity that can compass a
question. “Where will you'stop?” In the infancy of every society,
when the first step is made—there was ever a wondering grannam to
exclaim—“Where will you stop?” And so the world went on. The
waggon, asked it of the mail-coach—the mail-coach of the railway-
train—the railway-train of the electric telegraph, and—as an astounding
climax of interrogatives, the REveREND EARL NELson of the audacious
LoRD John Russell—“Where will you stop?”
The Earl, moreover, clenched his argument against toleration of the
Jews—(when Jews were no longer mulcted of their grinders or their
money; doubtless some NELson of the middle ages, marvelling at the
clemency, ſasked—“Where will you stop?”)—that the world at large
cared nothing for the Hebrew. Certainly, we anticipate no riot from
the fact that, the Jew Bill has been defeated: Christians will not
fraternise with the denizens of the Minories, and march upon the
Lords. NELson's windows are safe; nor will he be given to the flames,
in effigy, in Holywell Street or Houndsditch. But the Lords' majority
will not settle the question. Still MoRDECAI will sit on the steps—
sit and sit on the outside—until society insists that he be allowed to
take his seat in the Commons.
. Meanwhile EARL NE1son believes that, the people care not for
justice to the Jew: and in such case leave the people to the enjoyment
of their indifference. For, if you do justice an ... before you are

A TRAGEDY IN HIGH LIFE |
OUR, friends the French have some reputation for proficiency in a
particular branch of industry not represented in Hyde Park—that is,
unch was going to say, in dramatic literature; but the days of RAcINE,
and CoRNEILLE, and Moºre have departed. ell; say, instead,
that they are considered to be rather clever playwrights. . At any rate,
the article which they manufacture competes successfully in the market
with British produce; and a new tragedy from Paris holds, presumably,
a decent rank among imports. Such a commodity has recently arrived in
this country, and may be pronounced to be a very pretty piece of goods.
MM. AugustE MAQUET, and Jules. LACRoix are the fabricators of
this work, which they call “A Drama, in Five Acts, in Verse.” Being
of a dismal and melancholy nature, with a suicide for the catastrophe,
it has thus all the elements of genuine tragedy, except that the verse
in which its five acts are written is not poetical. In remarking on a
H. of a tragic nature, Mr. Punch may be thought to step a
ttle out of his way; but not so-no: there are some tragedies which
are strictly in it. There is the Pyramus and Thisbe of MM. QUINCE
and Bottom; there is also the Valéria of MM. MaquET and LACROIx.
Waleria, the heroine of this nice play, is the wife of the EMPEROR
CLAUDIUs. The lady so denominated is called by her second name—
her first having acquired an odour of which the ventilation of more than
eighteen hundred years has failed to deprive it. MM. Lacroix and
MAQUET are evidently not the sort of dramatists to *. the fact
that the nomenclature of a rose does not affect its fragrance, nor to
understand, the converse of that SHAKSPEARIAN proposition. The
§: of their glorification is better known by her primary appellation
of MessaLINA.
The history of the person alluded to is in general so sufficiently noto-
rious, that, for further particulars, the reader who does not understand
Latin, is referred to the sixth satire of JUVENAL, where he will find an
account of the conduct of MRs. CLAUDIUs as intelligible as it is proper
that he should be presented with.
He may, however, be informed, that, according to JUVENAL, MRs.
CLAUDIUS played her pranks under the assumed name of LyciscA. On
this foundation our Gallic dramatists have built. They have repre-
sented Waléria (that is, MRs. CLAUDIUs) and Lycisca as two persons,
only bearing an extraordinary personal resemblance to one another;
whence it happens that the acts and deeds of the “thing of naught”
get attributed to the amiable and interesting Empress. -
So far, perhaps, there is nothing in this but an eccentric taste, a
taste in French dramatic writing allied to that sometimes shown in
French confectionery. The idea of making a heroine out of a MEssa-
LINA, Punch takes to have been conceived by the same kind of imagina-
tion as that which devises sweetmeats in the form of loathsome insects,
and the like; apparently regarding both interest and appetite as stimu-
lated by the suggestion of the abominable.
But the peculiar manner in which MM. MAQUET and LACROIx
whiten their Roman sepulchre with their French stucco, merits farther
notice, Paléria (MRs. CLAUDIUs) is rendered a pattern of affection
and fidelity to—another gentleman than her lord and Emperor. As for
old CLAUDIUS, her relation to him is about as sacred as that of a ward
to an imbecile old guardian in an English farce. The sentimental
affinity of Waléria to Silius is coolly taken as constituting her appeal
to the sympathies.
The points—to use a technical phrase—in the tragedy of Valéria are
not numerous, amounting just to one; and that one has not the com-
pensating advantage of being select. It is a scene in which Lycisca, the
courtesan, gets tipsy, after the manner of the ancients, in a revel with
Mnester, a pantomime dancer.
When the Bishop of LoNDON has been told that the Fº above
described has been acted in this town, his Lordship will probably
wonder at the progress, which he will imagine the French language
must have been making in the Metropolitan slums, and will be, perhaps,
for bringing a bill before the Peers for the better regulation of tavern
tºº. Waléria, however, has been played no farther out of the
Ishop's particular beat than the St. James's Theatre. RAcHEL sus-
tained the several characters of Waléria and Lycisca, and certainly wore
her two pairs of buskins as well as their fit would allow. She appa-
rently delighted large and fashionable audiences; and she certainly
interposed her genius between the arms of MoRPHEUs and Mr. *:::
Well, at any rate, the emancipation of the stage is now safe. Now
that Waléria has been allowed to be enacted, what possible performance
will be prohibited on the ground of its moral tendency? The office of
Dramatic Censor will of course be henceforth a sinecure—the sole
function of the Licenser of Plays will be to confer boundless license.
An Aldermanic Salute for the Artillery Company.
THE reason the “H. A. C.” was excluded from the Guildhall
Entertainment was, because the Aldermen and Common Councilmen
thought such “great guns.” of themselves, that it did not require the
aid of any other Artillery to make the Ball go off well.

52 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MANIACAL PAS DE TROIS,
DANCED BY POLICEMAN MAC X. AND TWO FRIENDS AT WAUXBIALL.
BOOK OF ETIQUETTE FOR THE CITY.
(To be consulted when the QUEEN attends another Ball.)
NUMBERs prove respectability. So, collect as man º: together as you
can. If you can cram three thousand people into a Hall that will not contain
two thousand, all the better. Your Ball may not be so comfortable, but it will
be all the more respectable. -
Dancing at a Ball is not necessary. If you have no room, it is better to
dispense with it. Let the band play the music-first a uadrille, then a polka
—and after that a waltz—varying each tune a little—and the forms of society
are quite complied with. People are tired of dancing, especially when there is no
clear space to dance in.
Talking of the forms of society, it is usual to stand upon them whenever the
QUEEN (that is to say, when you catch the QUEEN, again) is coming in your
direction. If there is not a form, take a chair—or a table—do not stand upon
any ceremony, but upon the first thing that comes in your way. If you are not
lººk in jumping up, the QUEEN will be out of sight, and you will miss seeing
er.
Should you miss seeing the QUEEN, run after her; do not lose heart or breath
—waylay her—lie in ambush for her, until you succeed in meeting her face
to face—and then take a good stare HER MAJESTY cannot fail to be well
pleased with your earnestness.
If you see a number of persons hurrying in one particular direction, join them
by all means, for you may be sure they are running either after PRINCE
ALBERT or the QUEEN–and it may be both. The chance is too valuable to be
thrown away. The QUEEN may smile, the PRINCE may nod!
When supper is announced, all hurry down together. Press forward as much
as you can—or else the wings of all the chickens may have flown away before
your arrival, and have carried off everything with them.
At supper you must take care of yourself. Where there are so many mouths
to feed, you may be sure that every person's hand is raised against his neighbour's
|. so if you get anything on yours, you had better make the most of it as
ong as you can keep it. If you don't help yourself, you may depend upon it no
one else will.
It is customary at a City dinner sometimes to pass the bottle, when asked
for it. But it is different at supper. It is laid down as a general rule, that if
you get a bottle, you had better keep it—that is to say, as long as there is any-
thing in it. If empty, of course you pass it on to your neighbour.
It is not necessary to preserve silence at supper—far from it. Noise is a loud
sign of gaiety—so be as noisy as you like. Laugh. Do not wait for something
to make you laugh, but laugh at everything. If an Alderman attempts, a witti-
cism, laugh. # a Common Councilman ventures on a joke, and falls down
in the iii. and smothers it as flat as himself, never, mind, laugh all the same
—laugh all through the supper—without knowing why or wherefore. A City
sº is nothing without roars of laughter! - -
there is a door to go in by, make a º: of going out by it...On the same
principle, if there is a door to go out by, do not fail—as you love City regularity
—to go in by that very door. - - - -
As A GENERAL RULE, every one invested with a little brief º must
make himself, when the QUEEN visits the City, as big and as ridiculous as
he possibly can.

PITY the sorrows of a poor old soul,
That never asked your charity before,
Nor seeks it now—reserve your paltry dole-
Make her amends from your abundant store!
Thin, tatter'd clothes her poverty bespeak,
She, who a decent living earned for years,
Is ruined, and forbid her bread to seek,
By affluent gentlemen and wealthy peers.
She kept a stand in Hyde Park's royal ground,
A grant from Royalty for rescue owed;
Her grandsire saved the KING from being drowned,
Whose gratitude the privilege bestowed.
Hard is the usage of the helpless poor!
Had she a castle owned, entailed instead,
Official flunkeys had revered her door,
That now have driven her from her humble shed.
The Woods and Forests bid her quit her home;

She begs them hard their cruel hands to hold ;
And SEYMoUR, to confirm the heartless doom,
Writes her an answer miserably cold.
Wainly she tells the story of her grief;
The Board has nothing like a human breast;

From PHIPPs's answer, if we may divine,

They seized the very bricks that formed her cot,
Unpaid for which, she wanders forth forlorn.

But stern policemen war against her wage;

to a º that the QUEEN was
going to visit Guildhall a second
time. They need not have dis-

sarily. The contradiction , was
uite useless, for not a soul be-
lieved the rumour. When the
recollection of the first Ball has
died away, then the QUEEN ma
induced to try a second,
but not before. The fact is,
HER MAJEsty had so much of

! I relieved myself of the encumbrance of my wealth.
THE INCOME AND EXPENDITURE OF THE
RIGHT REVEREND DR. PUNCH.
If I were a Bishop with from £5,000 to £28,000 a year, I would soon
silence any remarks that might be made about the largeness of my
income. In whatever ignorance I allowed one of my hands to remain
as to the actions of the other, I would take care that the Public, at
least, should be acquainted with the operations of both. I would—or
my name is not Punch.
At present, a single hand only of a Bishop is seen at work. Every-
body beholds his right pocketing money: nobody perceives his left
disposing of the cash.
Consequently, an opinion has become prevalent that out of upwards
of £20,000, perhaps, of yearly revenue, the greater portion is expended
on the appetites, desires, propensities, and affections of the episcopal
individual. A good deal of it, having first been transmuted into fluid
and solid aliments of a luxurious nature, is supposed to be converted
bodily into Bishop., Some part is estimated to be spread over
the surface of the prelate in the form of canonicals. It is reckoned
that the carriage runs away with another share. Not a little, it is
surmised, is turned into ribbons, silks, satins, lace, and other articles of
attire or ornament, investing or decorating the Bishopess, and the
other females of the Right Reverend family. A considerable portion is
suspected to be absorbed by the collegiate education and accompanying
indulgences of his Lordship's eldest son, or is conjectured to be more
legitimately laid out in the purchase of a commission, or in procuring a
post, for another of his, offspring, And, a handsome remainder is
imagined to be deposited at the banker's. The world cannot well
conceive how so much money can be kicked down except by yachting,
betting, driving four-in-hand coaches, keeping a stud and a pack of
hounds, or undertaking the management of an opera-house. People
know that the Bishop could never get rid of it by using any degree of
hospitality, unless he were continually giving Lord MAYor's dinners and
Champagne suppers. They do not reflect that the establishment of a
Bishop is not quite so splendid as that of a Sultan, and that the whole
...' Bench, however, large consumers of good things, would
robably be found to weigh less than an equal number of distressed
armers.
Now, then, if I were a Bishop, the low-minded world—which never
dreams of the possibility of such a thing as devoting riches to bene-
ficence—should know how my money went. I should not care about
being accused of parading my charity. My object would be to vindicate
the character of my order. I would publish a book that should confute
HoRsMAN, confound the politics of SIR BENJAMIN HALL, and scatter
all our enemies. That book would create a deeper sensation than any
ublication that I know of has excited of late years. Therein should

and all the various expenses I had gone to in scattering plenty over a
smiling diocese, and making wives and children happy. It should
be manifest that I was only the almoner of my see; merely a con-
duit for the distribution of its revenues, and that of the stream of
#.” that passed through my hands, very little indeed stuck to my
gers.
This most interesting publication, in short, should be a Bishop's
Account Book—a work showing, in the most satisfactory manner, how

i.". any farther relief from that burden, it would be for the nation
Judge.
HANGING ON TO THE EXHIBITION.
We notice that several tradesmen have adopted the trick of hanging
on to the Exhibition. They could not command admission by their
own talents, so they endeavour to hang on to the building ły the
aid of some little miserable falsehood. They pin these falsehoods
on to the corners of their shawls, or let them, dangle, fanciſully
from the ribbons of their bonnets. They print them in brave bold
letters on the pieces of pasteboard that give the public the novel
information that such and such a Wisite is “CHAstE,” or that the pea-
green Pardessus, which is opening its arms in the most affectionate
manner, the whole breadth of the window, as if it wanted to embrace
#: earliest opportunity of meeting with a purchaser, is “QUITE THE
GE.’
These fashionable announcements abound mostly in Leicester Street
—the late Cranbourn Alley—and in all the ticketing-shops along
Oxford Street and Holborn. One fact, printed in large vermillion
letters, at least the thickness of a red-hot poker, made us quite start
in. It revealed to us the important secret that a Beaver Bonnet,
big enough to be the coal-scuttle that ſeeds the fire of the Palm-house
at Kew, was “Worn by HER MAJEsty at the EXHIBITION ; ” the
latter word being large enough to be read by a short-sighted man
without spectacles from the opposite side of the way. Further on, a
Coiffeur de Paris intimated to us, through the mouthpiece of a pink
label, that a beautiful brown Wig was “Selected by PRINCE ALBERT
at the EXHIBITION’—the largeness of the latter word being such as
would have done no discredit to one of JULLIEN’s monster posters.
The wig was curly, and beautifully full–and well it may have been, if
only to cover the baldness of a story on so large a head. We were
next stopped in Holborn to admire a Shawl, the pattern of which must
have been taken from a lobster salad, and which a printed card
informed us was “Too LATE FOR THE ExhibiTION: ” meaning, we
suppose, that some one had attempted to wear it on the opening day,
but had been so stared, and laughed, and hooted at by all the little
boys, that the lady, venturesome as she was, had been obliged to
turn back, and so the Shawl had arrived “Too Late for the Ex-
hibition.”
These are not half the tricks with which tradesmen dress up their
ugly goods, only, the dressing, does not make them look, any the
prettier... One bold genius has drawn, a sort of landscape in
teeth, which gives you the toothache to look at... Underneath it is
written, “THE ORIGINAL IN THE EXHIBITION.”. We have not seen it
–nor do we wish to, particularly—but we imagine the view must be
in Tus(k)cany. Nº. genius has displayed a Fire-Extinguisher,
which is described as being “IN USE AT THE EXHIBITION.” Now,
as we have never heard of the Crystal Palace catching fire, we cannot
understand how the instrument in question can exactly be “in Use at
the Exhibition.” Probably a part of the Exhibition is set on fire
regularly every day, to prove the superior merits of this wonderful
* Fire-Extinguisher.” Perhaps it is kept in close attendance upon the
Koh-i-moor, upon the authority of scientific men, that the Diamond is
“a combustible body.” If so, we can account for there being, so
little fire in the Koh-i-Noor. The fact is, the “Fire-Extinguisher” has
completely put it out.
So various are the schemes for hanging on to the Exhibition, that
we expect to see MRs. GRAHAM's balloon announced to make an
ascent under the title of “THE ONLY BALLOON THAT HAS BEEN UP IN
THE ExHIBITION.”
THE CROWN AND THE MITRE,
“There’s a divinity doth hedge a king.” Touching and beautiful is
the practical recognition of this truth by the Bishop of GloucestER.
With a loyalty, whose source is in the breeches pocket, the Bishop
renews a lease “for three lives; ” and it is erroneously given out, that
these lives are the youngest lives of the Bishop's own family. Not so;
the Bishop, with an affecting, devotion, towards the Crown, chooses
“the lives of three infant children of the royal family!”. A family—
says MR. HoRsMAN–“notoriously one of the longest-lived in this
country.” Surely, there is an ungenerous insinuation conveyed in this
remark; a worldly-mindedness that smacks of the profane layman. If
the Bishop selected three of the royal children in preference to any of
his own olive branches, it was from no unseemly calculation of com:
parative longevity; but solely from a wish to vindicate to a sift-necked
generation, the necessary connexion of the Crown and the Mitre in all
things: from no remote desire to endow the wº prayer for the
long life of the royal family—a prayer put up in all pulpits—with a
monetary interest; but solely to prove the loyalty of the churchman in
the devotion of the lessor. There was once a Bishop who said to a
King, “Sire, you are the breath of our nostrils:” now the Bishop of
Gloucester proves, in a manner, what the by-gone Bishop declared:
for three of the Royal Children, by the conditions of the lease aforesaid,
are literally made the breath of the nostrils of the lessee. In them, he
ives, and moves, and has his being.
Were it possible there could be a condition of pagan society, in
which leases were granted not for a term of human lives, but of lives
of irrational animals, it is not unlikely that some astute bonze would
measure the duration of his leases º the lives of three tortoises
“notoriously of the longest-lived in his country.”., Nay, if, an old
Egyptian priest, he might take three lives of three of his sacred cats—
in all, seven-and-twenty lives;–but then, such astuteness would betray
the benighted selfishness of the infidel. How different the operation
of what the profane know as personal interest, in the serener soul of
the Christian accountant P
Nil Admirari.
WE really feel called on to admire a young gentleman, who, when

This is decidedly ingenuous. It seems difficult to say what will
become of the youth, if it be true that ex nihilo, nihilſit.

HE CHANCELLOR OF

to acknowledge the sum of £250,000
from three Bishops, whose names,
from obvious feelings of delicacy, he
refrains from mentioning. The mu-
nificent donation was sent under the
head of “Conscience Money,” and
was said to consist principally of
“Monies overpaid.” It was accom-
panied with the request that the sum
might be handed over to the Eccle-
siastical Commissioners, with the
view of its being applied to the in-

THE GREAT EGG MYTH.
THE REVEREND.MR. ALBAN PIPEcLAy—Chaplain to the 209th
jº. his regardful compliments to Mr. Punch, and #:
to direct his instant attention to a recent overwhelming letter of the
Colonel of the 8th Hussars, who—curtly as becomes an officer—denies
the popular conviction (though supported on oath) that º of his corps
was engaged in the Battle of the Eggs, on the day of the Qaks.
Since then—MR. A. P. observes, that—one MILEs, who “encloses his
card,” assures the Morning Herald that, “with one exception, no officer
of the 16th Lancers” was present in the apocryphal affray.
The REVEREND MR. A. F. submits to the consideration of Mr. Punch
this question—“Is not the whole matter a myth? Do the 8th Hussars
exist? Are there any 16th Lancers?” At a time like the present,
public opinion cannot be too cautious.
The wise PLUTARCH has propounded this question (not yet resolved),
“Which was the first, the bird or the egg?”
MR. ALBAN PIPEcLAY, in consideration of the high claims of the
army upon the gratitude of Englishmen, suggests that they had better
first determine the above question, ere they accuse of ungentlemanly
conduct the mythical officers of mythical forces. When it is determined
which—from the beginning of things—was the first, the bird or the
egg; then—MR. A. P. respectfully submits—then, will be the proper
time to investigate the causes of an assault which, in the opinion of
every military mind, is purely mythic and fabulous. But there will be
a wholesome re-action. Yes; another fortnight, and the eggs of the
8th and 16th will take their place with the roc's egg of Sinbad the
Sailor. “Such"—as MR. ALBAN PIPECLAY, after much thought upon
the matter, conceives—“such is life!”

THE PEACE MOVEMENT AND THE
PRELATES.
However Utopian may be the aims of MR.
CoBDEN and the other members of the Peace
Congress, there is no doubt that the designs of
the pacificators—the endeavour to turn swords
into ploughshares, and spears into reaping-hooks,
and to establish the kingdom of peace upon earth
—are warranted º some decidedly strong texts.
The attendance, therefore, of all the Bishops at
the late meeting of the said Congress, at Exeter
Hall, was, at least, quite consistent with the
character of their office; and any ridicule which
it may have exposed them to must be regarded
in the light of martyrdom. To prevent mistakes,
it must be observed that the Bishops went to
º: º Congress, not with a crosier, but with
a look.

Double-negative Pius, my NoNo of Rome?

hich we’ve spent in the labour of cropping your comb.
Our PREMIER, instead of removing abuses,
Has been occupied mostly in weath'ring the storm
By your Holiness brew'd, which, of course, his excuse is
For not having got on with the work of reform.
To give your attention, friend Pius, I’d crave you
To one rather large fact that concerns our late row,
The majority, Pope, that declared “We won't have you!”
Your pretensions that firmly refused to allow.
So long, 'gainst a force so o'erwhelming how held you?
How brook'd we the tricks of your Irish “Brass Band,”
When we might, had we chosen, at once have expell'd you,
With your Bishops and Brief, from the face of the land?
What could it have been that induced us to bear a
Pope's carriage obstructing the national way?
A gem—which I don't think adorns the tiara–
A jewel, my Pontiff, entitled “fair play.”
Would your Holiness stand as much argumentation
In case we had foisted a Bishop on you?
Would you grant such a clergyman bare toleration,
Or isn’t that more than you’re willing to do?
Well; be that as it may, you have no persecution
For your prelates or pastors in England to fear,
Secured by the shield of a free Constitution—
That’s if they won't fly in the face of it—here.
Now I hope we shall all live together in quiet;
All have their opinions; let each hold his own;
And your folks, on the subject of doctrines or diet,
Just believe what they please-only leave us alone.

URING the past week GENERAL

has printed his veto against the

There {j be no Winter

tion, the foxes—the little foxes
have spoilt our vines! How-
ever, with the instinctive justice
of a great mind, GENERAL Fox
suggests reparation of the fullest

—asks GENERAL Fox—as a statue of PRINCE ALBERT, and a statue of
RICHARD COEUR pulſion . . When we consider the beautiful significance
that is borne to the Crystal Palace by the traditional reputation of the
battle-axe King of the Lion's Heart, we must confess the idea to be as
profound as felicitous. The worshipper is worthy of the sº :
Coeur Du Lion of Coeur Du RENARD. To be sure, we have heard of an
individual-by name, if we mistake not, Joseph Paxton—who is said
to be associated with the notion of the Crystal Palace, but it is natural
that GENERAL Fox—with his great martial tendencies—should forget
Joseph THE FIRST in favour of the earlier Richard. - -
Any way, we trust that the idea of Colonel Fox, if carried out, will
furthermore be made to redound to his individual honour. If we are
to have a statue of PRINCE ALBERT (to which we object not, if erected
in the Winter Garden, standing amidst congenial olive,) and a statue of
Richarp in bushes of dragon's-mouth, –let there also be the rera
effigies of GENERAL Fox, accompanied by the statue of a certain vigilant
bird, with which foxes are commonly associated.

HERALDIC FRAGMENTS.
N treating of animals borne
on the shield as "charges”
(and the charges for which,
by-the-by, come to some-
thing, in case you want a
grant of one, now), we notice
a peculiarity in our friend
the Stag. He is represented
as tripping, when an ordinary
animal would only be passant.
He is at gaze—that is to say,
looking about him with con-
siderable intelligence and
curiosity—when an ordinary
creature is gardant. And he
is often found in a position
º marked as
lodged. Who shall say that
Heraldry is meaningless, or
gone by, in modern times?
How often has the Stag been
only too securely lodged

Animals are often blazoned
or pictured in characteristic
and honourable attitudes, in
preference to others.

for instance, is in her piety.
This symbol is borne by lofty
aristocrats—and of course
symbolises the care with
which they provide for their young ones out of the public money. . A

in his pride—which exactly applies to the case of a Premier. ...An

p There are a lot of imaginary animals borne in º: and perhaps
the most imaginary º are the warriors named as the founders of
families in “The Peerage.” Too often, the griffin or the unicorn
are as really historical as these persons. It has been supposed that
iffins, unicorns, &c., were once believed to have been met by
rusaders during their journeys in the East; and perhaps some
centuries hence, a policeman azure, passant, and gardant, with a baton
in his dexter paw, will be borne by the descendants of some. London
families on the same pretext. At all events (a propos of this idea), “a
flººk sans beak and feet,” is still known under the name of a cannel in
Heraldry. Perhaps the said descendants will bear a duck, still further
demolished, in memory of the exploits of the same animal in our day.
The heraldic word “proper” is º to birds when borne of their
natural colour. Thus, those young birds whose eggs recently annoyed
the Kennington people on the Oaks Day, would be described simply
as goslings proper-meaning green.
It is a well-known rule in Heraldry, that metal must not be put on
metal, nor colour on colour. You cannot with propriety blazon thus–

the introduction of water-bogets—such as those borne by the name of
BourchIER. These, of course, came on the tapis, very naturally, when

A PALINODE.
From Punch to HENRY BROUGHAM.
“During the last five or six weeks, he had with the utmost difficulty, and against
the opinion of his medical advisers, attended the service of their Lordships' House.
During the last ten days the difficulty had increased, and become more severe. In the
hope of assisting in this greatmeasure, in a cause to which his life had been devoted, he
had struggled to the last, until he found he could struggle no more.”—Lord Brougham's
last Speech on Law Reform in the House of Lords.
AND is the busy brain o'erwrought at last?
Has the sharp sword fretted the sheath so far?
Then, HENRY BROUGHAM, in spite of all that’s past,
Our ten long years of all but weekly war,
Let Punch hold out to you a friendly hand
And speak what haply he had left unspoken
Had that sharp tongue lost nought of its command,
That nervous frame still kept its spring unbroken.
Forgot the changes of thy later years,
No more he knows the Ishmael once he knew,
P. of battle 'mongst the Peers, -
Your hand 'gainst all men, all men's hands 'gainst you.
He knows the Orator whose fearless tongue
ed into infamy and endless scorn
The wretches who their blackening scandal flung J
Upon a Queen—of women most forlorn.
He knows the lover of his kind, who stood
Chief of the banded few that dared to brave
The accursed traffickers in negro blood,
And struck his heaviest ſetter from the slave;
The Statesman who, in a less happy hour
Than this, maintained man's right to read and know,
And gave the keys of knowledge and of power
With equal hand alike to high and low;
The Lawyer who, unwarped by private aims,
Denounced the Law’s abuse, chicane, delay:
The Chancellor who settled century’s claims,
And swept an age's dense arrears away;
The man whose name men read even as they run
On every landmark the world's course along,
That speaks to us of a great battle won
Over untruth or prejudice or wrong.
Remembering this, full sad I am to hear
That voice which loudest in the combat rung
Now weak and low and sorrowful of cheer,
To see that arm of battle all unstrung.
And so, even as a warrior after fight
Thinks of a noble foe, now wounded sore,
I think of thee, and of thine ancient might,
And hold a hand out, armed for strife no more.

Then her lower-deck ports are under water, and we plug them up.
Without her lower tier she doesn't carry metal enough; so we clap two
sixty-fours at her bows, and two sixty-fours at her stern. Then she
won’t make any way at all, and we are forced to begin all over again;
and the account concludes with an awful bill to pay.
In very much the same way, our landsman architect builds us a
House of Commons. It is a beautiful building, only before it will do
it wants a new roof, and new windows, and new galleries, and new
lobbies, and new floors; and after all this, we are warned that its
acoustic properties have been only partially tried.
To be sure, we have one building that answers its purpose admirably,
and that is the Crystal Palace. Therefore we are going to pull it down:
But it wasn’t built by an architect. It wasn't at all like a practical
people to trust a gardener. They should have left it to the R.A.s,
and then we might have calculated on a great architectural master-
piece. ...To be sure, it would not have held the articles for exhibition,
or, if it had, there wouldn't have been room for the spectators; or,
if there had been room for both, it wouldn't have been built in the
time; or, if it had been built in time, the bricks and mortar wouldn't
have been dry; and if the bricks and mortar hadn't been dry, the
building would have tumbled down. Yes, certainly, the Exhibition
Commissioners were anything but practical men.
The Value of the Koh-i-moor.
THERE is a vast difference of opinion as to the precise value of the
Mountain of Light in the Great Exhibition. Many are inclined to
think we have been making a mountain of a molehill. A Spanish
jeweller of some experience has estimated it at upwards of a million
reals;, while an English friend of ours, so far from appreciating it by
reals, has set it down at one enormous s
Touching Liberalities.
THE newspapers tell us that— -
“At his recent rent audit, George Hupsos, Esq., M.P., of Newby Park, liberally
returned to his numerous tenantry 10 per cent. on their respective rentals.”

respective losses

Now as you’ve cooked the goose of your Popes and CARDINAL WISE-
MANTS,
I dare say, Mr. Punch, you’ll find room for these here two advertise-
ments.
What is your opinion about them as a candid man?
Number two, you must know, concerns myself and HANN. |
As to number one, I can't think who ever would answer that;
Nobody that takes care of number one, I should say, but some flat.
But only to think how very much improved the age is,
And what a rise has took place in poor servants' wages." -
I don't mind the word, though it sounds rather more like the gallery
Than the boxes; 21 pound wages is better than 20 pound salary.
But what I say is this, thof Iown my situation is humble,
A good Plain Cook as gets more than a Governess has no call to grumble.
But Cookery seems to be getting into hestimation; - |
Leastways some folks thinks more of it than others does of heddication.
But then some folks is gentlefolks, and others the reverse.
20 pounds salary wouldn’t leave much in the purse
Of a young lady, who in course would be expected to appear
As such, when her things was paid for at the end of the year.
20 pounds a year, and to be always speaking French—what a shame !
They couldn't get a parrot for less that could do the same.
What sitch people gives their servants I should very much like to know,
Seeing they pays their Governess so low.
I shouldn’t think they wore out many pots and kittles
Or had much to give away in the shape of broken vities s
And getting their tooition so werry cheap, I should dread
That the scollards of this establishment was about as well taught asſed.
A REGULAR STAND-STILL.
AN astronomer, speaking of the effect of the last Eclipse of the Sun
in 1812, says, “that horses came to a stand-still, and neither whip nor
goad would induce them to move on.” We know of some political
parties who seem to labour under the influence of a sort of moral eclipse;
for, remaining in their darkness, they camot be induced either by
goad or spur to move on. Among other remarkable phenomena, “oxen
arrayed themselves in a circle, as if for defence; ” and we are somewhat
surprised that in the absence of intellectual enlightenment, the oxen
have not gathered themselves into a circle in Smithfield, for the protec-
tion of their market.
The Enemy of Intolerance.
THE most distasteful clause in the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill to the
Pope's hierarchy is that which renders theiu liable to be proceeded
against, for infringement of its provisions, under the sanction of the
ATToRNEy-GENERAL, by a common informer. No wonder. From the
conduct of the Popish #: in Ireland with respect to the Queen's
Colleges, it might have been expected that the papal prelates would,
under any circumstances, object to common information.
A TAKING TITLE.
THERE is a spirited little Italian contemporary of ours, published
in London under, the name of the Bºo di Sºndrºla. We suppose
they call it the “Echo,” because they think it likely to “answer.’

THE END OF AN IRISH TALE.
THE announcement has just been made in the House of Commons,
that MR. J. O'Connell has accepted the stewardship of the Chiltern
Hundreds. We cannot conceive a more ‘. . volume than
would be produced if every steward of these celebrated
to publish an account of his stewardship. Considering the frequency of
an application for the office in question, we are prompted to inquire, why
Chiltern and its Hundreds cannot be invested with a few other dignities,
such as a butlership, cookship, or footmanship, for example, in order
that, the stewardship might no longer remain the only position open to
applicants. . We think also, that the Chiltern Hundreds might have a
housemaidship added, for the accommodation of such ladies as may feel
anxious to give Chiltern the benefit of their services. -
In congratulating MR. J. O'Connell, on his ambition having led him
to a post for which he is no doubt duly qualified, we may, perhaps, be
allowed to felicitate the Commons on the fact, that “the floor of the
House” is not likely to become the scene of that melancholy event to
which MR. J. O'Connell had at one time destined it. Instead of
dying on the floor of the House, the Honourable Gentleman is now at |b
liberty to select any one of the Hundreds of Chiltern as his final
resting-place. We, however, wish him long life to cultivate the
interests of that locality with which he has chosen to connect himself,
and health to devote himself to those duties which he has adopted as
being better suited to him than the functions of a Member of Parliament.
A propos of this new dignity of MR. J. O'Connell, we may add, that
a simple correspondent has asked us, whether the Qhiltern Hun >
whose stewardship seems so enviable, is the name of a steam-packet.

THE BLUSHING STATUES OF LONDON.
Brief by the Metropolitan Pontiff.
SINCE the most extraordinary and magnificent wonders are now
aily happening, to the confutation of incre º: and to the diffusion
of true enlightenment, in an age dazzled by the false glare of philosophy;
than which splendid marvels nothing can be more conducive, to §:
delectation of the cockles of our paternal heart, and the glory, honour,
and interest of our Office; we are by no means surprised to hear of
the stupendous miracle which has lately happened at Guildhall, in the
City of London, in the presence of many millions of spectators. For,
considering the utter, failure and most miserable, so to speak it, mull,
which was perpetrated by the Corporation in the Ball lately given by them
to HER MAJESTY, we thought it, very likely that some prodigy would
happen before long to render that absurd transaction the morememorable.
We therefore received as nothing more than what was to be expected, the
intelligence of the notorious fact, that, the statues of Gog and MAGog,
ever since that ridiculous event, have been seen from time to time to
e suffused, as to their faces, with a rosy hue; blushing for the mis-
management of the body corporate. Having nothing so much at heart
as the promotion of genuine rationality and the encouragement of
veracity, we have thought it fit to stimulate our faithful Public to the
observation"of this illustrious portent. We therefore grant an unlimited
indulgence in turtle-soup and iced punch to any one who, having H.
his due respects to the LoRD MAYOR, or other civic personage of the
requisite influence, shall have procured a ticket of admission to the next
Dinner given either in the said Guildhall or at the Mansion House, on
condition of his making a pilgrimage to Guildhall aforesaid, and takin
a sight at the City Giants, that he may have ocular demonstration o
the shame and confusion they are affected with, in beholding their
blushes on account of the City Ball; and if, through a depraved and
heretical obstinacy, he will not acknowledge that they do blush, let
him be &c. (Signed) 388852&Cº.

LECTURES ON YACHTING."
By PROFESSOR AquaRIUS BRICK.
- E were present when the
accomplished PROFESSOR
BRIck recently delivered
a series of Lectures on
Yachting, which were
very well attended. By
his kind permission, we
have preserved bits of
the discourses, here and
there. We extract, a
discrétion:—
“I come now,” went
on the Professor, “to
your most important
yachters—your genuine
swells. Their cutters are
in every harbour; you
trace their wake by
empty champagne bottles
on every sea. To such
dandy sea-kings I would
now say one word.
“About your choice of
cruising d you can-
not have much difficulty. The Mediterranean is your proper spot. It is true that we will not
tolerate its being made a French lake—its proper vocation is that of English pondſ
“I would advise you all to be very particular in not letting your ‘skipper” have too much
authority. Remember always, that ſº are the owner—high-spirited gentlemen do. Surely a
man may sail his own yacht, if anybody may ! It is as much his ...}} as his horse is. To
be sure, when the weather is very bad, I would let the fellow take charge then: , There is a very
odd difference between the Bay of Biscay and the water inside the Isle of Wight, when it blows.
And a skipper too much snubbed gets rusty at awkward times.
“Your conduct in harbour will be regulated by circumstances—which means, dinners.
Generally *. the fact of having a yacht will carry you everywhere. As every aeronaut
is “intrepid’ by courtesy, so every yachtsman is a ‘fashionable arrival.’ This great truth is
scarcely enough appreciated in England... I have known very worthy men spend in trying to get
into great society in London, sums which, judiciously invested in a yacht, would have taken
them to dozens of ſº º; houses abroad, You will get asked to dinner; you will be
feasted well, generally. Anything in the way of excitement—particularly good, rich, hospitable
excitement—is heartily welcome in our colonial settlements and stations.
“But I am not now speaking only to those who yacht, because to have a yacht is a fine thing.
I recognise also an imperial class of yachtsmen—the swans of the flock of geese...I have seen
a coronet on a binnacle, before now. I have seen a large stately schooner sail into a Mediterranean
port—as into a drawing-room—splendid and serene. The harbour-master's boat is on the alert
these mornings. The men-of-war send their boats to tow; the dandiest lieutenant goes in the
barge; the senior captain offers his services. When such a yacht as that goes into the Golden
Horn, the Sultan, is shown to these yachters—like any curiosity in his capital—like any odd
thing in his town!. They are presented to him, as it is called, that he may be looked at.
“To this magnificent class. I have not much to say. They don't snub their skipper—they
are far too fine to do that. They are scarcely distinctive as travellers, for they are the same
abroad as at home. In them, England is represented. England floats in a lump through the
sea, like DELos used to do. As they say and do just the same as they have always said and done
at home—see and mix, with the same kind of people—I often wonder what they learn by it.
When they go to visit Thermopylae or Marathon, it is with a lot of tents, donkeys, camp-stools,
travelling-cases, guides, and servants—such as XERxes might have had. They encumber the
ruins of temples with the multitude of their baggage. The position seems so unnatural, that
I can’t fancy their getting any moral or intellectual profit from it. They are too well off for
that—like a fellow who cannot see for fat. Depend on it, you cannot see much through a
painted window, however fine it is.” -
PROFEssoR BRIck concluded his first sketch amidst much applause.
THE BAR IN DANGER.
CoNSIDERABLE consternation has prevailed among the members of the Bar—and particularly
the outer portion of it—since the publication of the Report of the Commissioners on Process
and Practice. The Lawyers' Protectionist League, under the presidency of MR. BRIEFLEss, has
already been joined by MessRs. HoRRID and FLORID of the Criminal Bar, as well as by MEssRs.
MoHAIR, Nohair, SPLUTTER, FLUTTEE, MAMMON, and GAMMON, of the Courts at Westminster.
Though the report is signed by the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and the Attorney-
General, who has ii; given all the weight of his official position to the cause of Law
Reform, MR. BRIEFLEss is Fº to maintain—though a maintenance of any kind, from that
quarter is a poor look-out—that his own opinion ought to be taken in preference to that of SIR
ALEXANDER CocKBURN. M.R. BRIEFLEss particularly insists upon the impolicy of the recom-
mendation to abolish the Rule for Compute, which he declares that he regards, as a sort of
Palladium of British eloquence; for many a young orator has exercised his early pinions on
this rule, and prepared himself for the maturer flights of his full-fledged rhetoric.
MR. BRIEFLEss, insists that the Rule to Compute should have been preserved for the sake
of its elasticity, inasmuch as it admitted of being ºl. for in every º form, from the
silent bow to the enthusiastic burst of impassioned appeal, or the learned and elaborate
continually running rill of forensic argument.
MR. BRIEFLESS is understood to insist on the
fact, that LORD ELDON commenced his career
by moving for a Compute, as a reason why
the rule should be preserved, as the portal—
the side-door, the back-gate, the area entrance
to future greatness. The learned anti-re-
former also declares that to compute is, by
no means, the insignificant matter of course
that some people imagine; for it requires a
certain amount of proficiency in arithmetic on
the part of the advocate; and, in fact, MR.
BRIEFLESS declares he knows of no other
proceeding that offers a sort of guarantee
bhat the branch of education specified has
been attended to by the Barrister.
The Protectionist League of Lawyers pur-
pose holding an aggregate, meeting as soon
as a convenient site can be found, and the
Thames Tunnel has already been spoken of .
JEWISH NOTE AND QUERY.
Query.—Supposing none but Jews were re-
turned to Parliament at the next election,
what would be the result P
Note.—It would be rather curious—for as
a Jew is not allowed to take his seat in Par-
liament, we should have a House of Commons
that could not sit. The only way to compro-
mise the matter would be for the House to
legislate on its legs. This would do very
well for members who were accustomed to
Standing Committees;–but it would be rather
tiresome when the House was kept up to
a late hour in the morning by the squabbles
of the Irish Brigade. One advantage might
be, that probably it would shorten the length
of the debates—for the House, when pre-
vented from lolling on the benches, and going
to sleep, would be less inclined thanºver to
stand a long speech. The most obvious
result, however, would be that England could
literally boast then of hºle most Up-
right Legislature in the World.

THE RACES OF MAN.
We recollect a very instructive, amusing book, being published under the above title. It
contained one deplorable omission, however, which may be partly accounted for by the fact,
that at the time the book was published, MR. BATTY's Hippodrome was not in existence.
We are pleased at being able to repair that omission, and to increase the value of a clever
work with the addition of the following Races of Man, which, we must premise, have only
been recently discovered.
These important discoveries were made in a large circular building, open at the top, and
the interior scooped out, like a Stilton Cheese. In form it was not unlike a Roman Amphi-
theatre. . It is situate, somewhere about Kensington, and any one, by paying a small trifle
at the door-say a shilling, or a couple of shillings—will be shown º great civility over
the building.
It was inside the walls of this monster Stilton Cheese that we made our discoveries. At
one corner of the Stilton there had been nibbled a large hole, and in and out of this hole
there kept ºf: like so many rats and
mice, a number of horses and poneys, ostriches
and monkeys, whose principal amusement con-
sisted in running round and round the bottom
of the cheese at the very top of their speed, and
then running out again.
With our matural quickness, wesoon discovered
that there was a method in these wild evolutions.
We involuntarily ejaculated “Eureka!” as we
found out that the great object in the running
was to see which horse, or poney, or ostrich, or
monkey should come in first. In short, they
formed a number of Races; and we were not a
little proud in this matter of fact world, in which
everything has been turned, not only inside out,
but also outside in, as in Leicester Square, to
have suddenly opened the door, in such a
strange out-of-the-way cupboard as Kensington,
upon several new Races of Man.
The following is a faithful description of these
new Races:—
First of all, there is the CHARIOT RACE.
Several warriors in tub-like chariots gallop round
the circle. The warriors have all Roman noses,
in order to give the entertainment the most
classic feature of ancient times. Wreaths of
stockings shed over the calves that animate the
scene a beautiful couleur de rose. In each chariot
are four horses, and they have Roman noses also,
and the laurel-wreath round their brows. Twice
they gallop round the merry circle. The Race
is run, almost before it has commenced; and the
shouts of the applauding multitude proclaim that
Jones, not of the Seven Hills, but of the Seven
Dials, is the victor.
The next Race is on horseback; not as in
Rotten Row, seated quietly in the saddle, but
standing upright on the backs of two maked
horses. The warriors are again from Rome, and
their gay scarfs stream behind them, like a flying
rainbow. . They shuffle backwards and forwards,
like a pack of cards in the hands of a conjuror.
At last Red is the turn-up card, and again Jones
is the trump who wins.
...Again the dustman's bell is rung, and a pair of
high-mettled Ostriches plunge into the saw-dusty
arena. This Race is unquestionably the funniest
Race of Man—funnier even than the French
Race. The other Races are exciting. They
bring your heart into your mouth.
Qstrich Race only fills it with laughter. The
Ostriches do not run; they fly. The Bedouin,
who follows on his Arab steed, plies his spurs in
vain to catch them. Their long legs seem to
have wings to them. You might as well at-
tempt to catch MERCURY by the heel as one
of them. The boy...seems to sit as light as an
ostrich feather, on its back. The riding, too, is
peculiar; no whip is requisite to urge them on-
no bridle is necessary to guide them—no bit
wanted to make them turn to the right or the
left. They run, like a bill, without any effort, of
their own accord, and do not stop until taken
up at the end of their a pointed running. It
must be very pleasant riding—for the Ostrich
never throws his rider. e does not kick
either, nor plunge, nor rear, nor jib, nor roar,
nor is he subject to any of the ills which horse-
flesh is heir to. We expect to see Ostrich
riding very popular. We may hear of more im-
prºbable things than a lady saying to her groom,
“John, bring my Ostrich to the door at six
9'clock.” At all events, a Derby, with nothing
but three-year-old Ostriches in it, would be ex-
tremely amusing. We must say, that of all birds
the 9trich affords the very best game—by along
run.
There were several other Races, but, after the
Ostriches, they l d a long way behind. There
was the race of Monkeys, but we have seen so
much of the same ºf in the Park better done,
There was the Race of Jockeys; but they were
not so good as many young Lords whom we

have witnessed in a similar character. There were Races with female
charioteers—carrying off gold cups with immense ecstacy; but the
cup brought no pleasure to our lips, and we turned our heads away
with the peevishness of satiety. There were Races also with horses
with and without riders, and a heap of other Races. In fact, we do not
know when we had seen a greater mixture of Races.
The Great Exhibition was to have brought every member of the
human º together; but the only Exhibition that has effectually
done it, is BATTY's Hippodrome. It has succeeded in doing what
civilisation, we suppose, will do some day—for it has brought all the
Races of iian into the same Circle!

A FORM THAT WANTs REFORMIMG--
THE favourite objection with several Members against ALDERMAN
SALoMoss taking his seat is, that there is “no form for it.” The
objection is not a bad one, for it stands to reason that if there is “no
form,” the Honourable Member can hardly sit down upon it.
Idem per Idem.
CoLoNEL SIBTHoRP presents his compliments to the Editor of Punch,
and begs to state, that the statutes of WILLIAM and MARY, which im.
osed the Abjuration Oath, were clearly directed against the Jews.
he statutes were meant to exclude the Jacob-ites; but Is RAEL and
Jacob are identical, therefore the statutes were meant to exclude the
Israel-ites. Q.E.D.
PROTECTIONIST-IDRAMATICs.
PROTECTION recently got a little “draw” by the performance of
MR. G. F. Young's Trip to Scarborough. By electing such a man, in
triumph, Protection shows her love for another play, too—She Stoops to
wer-with a vengeance!
THE CHURCH AND THE DEAD.
“SEEng that we are all equal before the throne of God”—such was
the tenor of the º DowageR's testament—“I desire that m
funeral may be conducted with as little ceremony as possible.” Suc
was the meaning of the QUEEN Dowager of England; but the Dean
and Chapter of Windsor—by virtue of their function—knew better.
Money-money—is a necessary consecration of the dead; and therefore
they demand ºthe Government the fee of £220 for opening St.George's
vault, that upon one of its shelves so much Royal dustrmay be deposited.
The Duke of Sussex sagaciously baulked the Dean and Chapter, and
chose a cheaper resting-place in Kensal Green.
But the dead seem to be the especial property of Churchmen; who
will turn the y not only upon dead men's dust, but upon dead men's
memories. hat is done in the Royal vaults of Windsor is imitated in
the churches of hamlets... Once upon a time—let us say a few months
ago—there died an excellent man in the historic village of Putney:
made historic by Wolsey, who, alighting from his mule, went upon his
knees, and blessed his royal tyrant; historic by FAIRFAx, who had
head-quarters there; historic by SAMUEL PEPys, who would eat his
dinner and chirrup his song at Barn Elms; historic by the birth of
|GIRBox; and still and still historic by the eccles
iasticalingenuity of a
fervid preacher; who brings us back to the death of our benevolent
deceased. Men, with a tender memory for his life of goodness, met to
take counsel how best to enshrine the recollection of his benevolence,
“Let it be something enduring—something that shall defy the
tooth of time. And, my friends, what better than a modest marble
tablet affixed to the walls of that church wherein our philanthropic
friend was wont to offer up his Sabbath prayers?” Felicitous thought;
the laudatory lines were written; cut in marble; and the marble
º placed for ever in the church, to delight the eyes and touch the hearts
§ of yet unborn cºngregations. ...And so the ceremony finished?
Not quite. A few days afterwards and a demand was made for
certain fees. If you put up a tablet, no bigger than a door-plate, in a
church, you must pay the suggestive churchman. “Good people, fifteen
pounds, if you please: only fifteen.”
In a small way, is not the church of Putney worthy of St. George's
Chapel, Windsor? Churchmen—we doubt not—will be delighted by
that better system of things, surely arriving, that shall no longer make
the dead such a very marketable commodity. Beautiful is the figure of
the Christian dovel And otherwise than beautiful the unclean bird
that feeds on carcases.
THE WESTED INTERESTS OF OLD WOMEN.
The Lords' Committee on the Smithfield-market Removal Bill—in a
tenderness for vested interests which some of their Lordships have not
shown to poor ANN Hicks—have decided that, for the loss which the
Corporation of London will sustain by the abatement of their lucrative
mulsance,
“The City are entitled to compensation, to be calculated on an average of five years
of the tolls prior to its closing. Should the site become valuable, and built on, the tolls
to make up the deficiencies, as in Clause 50 of the Islington-market Bill.”
To be calculated at what rate percent?...Deficiencies in what?
Really, there is more to be understood in this specimen of lordly
composition than we can possibly understand; except, the general fact
that the City is to be indemnified for the loss of Smithfield out of the
tolls. Considering that the City has had the fullest warning of the
inevitable fate of its filthy cattle-mart, and might, had it chosen, easily
have made a fair arrangement with regard to the new market, we
should say, let the tolls out of which it is to be compensated be those
of the knell which has so long been tolling Smithfield's doom.
The Parliamentary Treadmill.
The failure of Mr. HERRIES's motion respecting the Navigation
Laws, suggests the question, Why are the Protectionists like a squirrel
in a cage?—to which there can º: one answer—That they are always
moving, and never getting on.
PROPERTY FOR-rious uses.
MR. PUNCH on being asked what was the meaning of “Cathedral
Trusts and their Fulfilment,” answered—Deans and Chapters pocketing
all the money they are trusted with.
Evening Dress for Ladies in the City.
THE Times states that at the Guildhall, Ball many of the ladies'
dresses were ripped up the back....We do not doubt this—for to believe
MR. DAKIN’s statement—the Ball must have been “a perfect ripper.”
—Bell's Life.

PRIZES AWARDED AT THE HORTICULTURAL FETE.
THE weather is always so unmerciful at the Horticultural Fête, that
we think, that the company, more especially the ladies, deserve prizes
}. distributed to them for their hardihood in making their appearance
there. - e. : .
We expect next July to read an award of prizes somewhat similar to
the following:—
To Miss CLARA pH WERE. For the prettiest drawn bonnet of pink
silk, trimmed with black lace and black bugles, completely spoilt by the
rain—The Gold GUNTER Medal. - -
To LADY AugustATHUMPER. For the most delicate crape dress,
with pinked flounces, and mantle en suite, slightly edged with Honiton
lace, so soiled that it can never be worn again—The Silver Swan AND
EDGAR Medal. - -
To MRs. CHERRY Bounce. For the most chaste dove-coloured silk
parasol, with muslin embroidery and silk fringe, completely, washed
out by the wet—The Howell AND JAMEs' pair of Earrings.
To Miss LAURA ADELGIsA STURBs. For the most recherché, rich,
puce-coloured glacé silk with embroidered flounces, and braided Poika
a l'Amazone to correspond, scarcely recognisable n, and actually
refused by her maid–A Buhl Box, containing two dozen of Jouvin's
best Gloves. . . . . - - - .
To MADEMoiselle FELICIE DE WERTPR£. For the neatest, thinnest,
smallest pair of French Bottines, completely wet through-A Box of
Bonbons from the Fidèle Berger. º
To LoRD NARCIssus, WERISOPHT. For a cherry-coloured paletót,
and a snow-white wide-awake made of the finest felt, both sacrificed
to the inclemency of the weather—A handsomely embroidered Cigar
Case and Silver Vinaigrette. -
To MR. HERCULEs SMITH...For wearing a pair of summer trousers,
hopelessly ruined—A Pair of Silver-Mounted Pistols.
USEFUL EMPLOYMENT OF WASTE TIME.
A LADY, living at Wimbledon, presented last week to her husband a
handsome waistcoat as a birthday present. It was most beautif
embroidered, and had been worked by her during the spare half-hours
that would otherwise have been wasted, whilst waiting at the various
stations on the South-Western Railway. So numerous are the delays
on that sleepy line, that ladies, who are compelled by necessity to travel
by it, make a practice now of taking their needlework with them in the
i.i. carriages, so that they may turn to some useful account the
dreadful waste of time that is squandered in going a simple journey of
ten miles. We have been shown Sto.NE's picture of “Cross Purposes”
most effectively worked in Berlin Wool by a young lady, who was
engaged on it,only for one month, and performed, but one journey to
town every day. This will give some little notion of the amount of
time which that one, journey, must have consumed per diem to have
enabled the fair Arachnea to have completed so laborious a piece of
work in so short a period |

THE thousands—the hundreds of thousands—of pounds that have
been º up in the Diocese of Durham and others by such an ex-
perienced Diver as MR. HoRsMAN, furnish only another proof that, in
ecclesiastical matters, none of us know one half of the treasures that
are buried at the bottom of the See.
The Great Day of the Session.
THE 28th of July was expected to have been a grand day in Parlia-
ment; for, considering the many laws that are made without adequate
information, a day legitimately º of legislation in the dark, would,
it was thought, have been taken full advantage of.

A Shabby Turn-out.
It was a general observa-
tion in the House of Com-
mons, on the night of the
removal of MR. SALOMONs by the order of the House, that it was
singular an objection should be made to the Member for Greenwich on
the score of his religion, when the Speaker himself had turned out a
Jew aſter all.
THE FRIENDS OF ITALY.
“NowHERE, in all, Italy, save now partly * the Piedmontese,
can a man think, speak, or act, as a being made in the image of God; ”
certain other images, Austrian, Roman, and Neapolitan, forbidding the
sublime privilege. Images of GoD are apt to become perplexing,
troublesome ; and therefore are to be overthrown as idols of a false
religion;–an infidelity blasphemous to Pope and Emperor. Images of
God the subjects of a K. of Naples! Let the images be made to crawl
in the dust; best showing their loyalty when they show themselves on
all fours. What has the crowned incarnation of evilry to do with the
images of God, if not to outrage and destroy them? FERDINAND of
Naples and the images of Gop! A gibbering satyr of the woods, with
a sceptre for a murderous club., Nevertheless, there are Englishmen—
made smug and comfortable by the sea that rolls around them, insuring
freedom by day and night; in their counting-houses and in their sheets
—who by no means approve of the discontent of those Italians, who
would walk upright before their rulers. And if in the bold attempt at
such unseemly, freedom they are rebuked, smitten into the dust,-
why, we really have our own taxes to º ; and when we dispassionately
consider the subject, what has Italy to do with us?
It is to make satisfactory answer to such, self-complacent querists,
that a Society is constituted; a Society numbering men whose names
are names of earnestness and truth. On the door of 19, Southampton
| Street, Strand, on a small brass-plate, may be read, “OFFICEs of THE
Society of The FRIENDs of ITALY.” The members of the Council
are upwards of seventy in number; a wide circle, holding such men as
LANDoR and MACREADY, ScholeFIELD and Lord DUDLEY STUART.
The purpose of this Society is not to make war on Italy—“not a war
of arms, but that kind of war which all acknowledge to be legitimate;
a war of intellect, of sentiment, and of political action.” ith this
F. vital in the hearts of some seventy faithful resolute men, the

... “Men are lived over again,” says SIR Thomas BRowNE; and surely
the KING OF NAPLEs, another ScyLLA, is re-made of blood and mire. A
ruthless savage, he ought to wear a crown of feathers, with his regality
tattooed in his portentous countenance. What is he more than a New
| Zealander, whose one merit it is not to eat men, only to outrage and
| destroy them P. MR GLADstone saw the late Prime Minister, PoERIo,
with others, chained to felons: chained and clothed in the infamous
garb of convicts; their declared offence, Republican aspirations:–
“The weight of these chains, I understand, is about eight rotoli, or between sixteen
movement, much as if one leg had been shorter than the other. But the refinement of
suffering in this case arises from the circumstance that here we have men of education
and high feeling chained incessantly together. For no purpose are these chains
undone; and the meaning of these last words must be well considered; they are to be
taken strictly. . . . . Among these, I myself saw a political prisoner, Romko, chained,
in the manner I have described, to an ordinary offender—a young man with one of the
most ferocious and sullen countenances I have seen among many hundreds of the
Neapolitan criminals.”
Once upon a time, runs the legend, there was a certain DUKE
Robert of SICILy; a worthy ancestor—whether he lived in the flesh
or only in the pages of the story-teller—who played the fiend with his
subjects—his unhappy images of GoD–even as the living KING of
NAPLEs AND THE Two Sicilies, the triple Monarch—the legitimate
CERBERUs. Now, this DUKE ROBERT, one day falling asleep, woke u
no longer outwardly a Duke, but as the Duke's fool and jester—a º

uke, that he might bless the wondering and rejoicing people. Whilst
the real Duke, in the despised body of the fool, was continually com-
|panioned with a loathsome ape, until, in the fulness of time, his Grace
himself;-the angel, his task completed, departing.
Oh, that our Kisa or The Two Sicilies might, for awhile, be made
co-mate with an ape; even as he manacles his Ministers with felons !
Though in truth FERDINAND may be taken as an improvement upon
DUKE ROBERT; being brute and potentate in one.
PUNCH'S CHALLENGE TO ME. HOBBS.
A Lock that cannot be Picked.
PUNCH throws out a º: to MR. HoBBs, which he is at liberty
to accept or not, just as he pleases. It is to operate on a Lock that
cannot be picked!. It has hitherto defied all attempts to turn aside one
of its springs, which are most numerous, and of such a complicated
nature, that no one has ever been able
to pick his way through them, much
less to get over them. It is defended
by a Bar that is most difficult to move,
though fortunes have been spent in the
numerous trials. It is full of Wards,
whose movements are guarded with the
most jealous scrutiny, so that it requires
the greatest nicety to get one of them
to bolt. The name of this wonderful
Lock is the CHANCERY Lock.
Every kind of key, silver and golden,
has been tried in vain to open it. The
treasures which are said to be enclosed
in the large money-chest which it defends, are reported to amount to
countless millions!
Now, Punch challenges MR. HoBBs to open the above celebrated
Lock! He may take, what time he pleases. He may operate with
what instruments he chooses. He may take it home with him, so as
better to study its many eccentric forms. In short, he may do what he
likes with it; and if MR. HoBBs opens it, he is a much cleverer man
than Punch takes him to be.
As for the reward for so much successful ingenuity, Punch will not
fix the amount, like MR. BRAMAH, at £200, or name any amount at all.
He will not pick a quarrel with Mr. Hoges upon any such trifle. Let
him only open the Great Chancery Lock, and he may help himself to
whatever amount he pleases | What would a hundred thousand pounds,
more or less, be, when taken out of the immense fortunes which, we
know, are locked up in Chancery! Let him only succeed, and we are
sure the nation would think the operation cheap at a million.
Rival Works of Art.
We have all seen and admired, in the Exhibition, the beautiful
Statue of “The Amazon,” which is supposed to be the chef d’aeuvre of
Kiss. But this is nothing compared to the Kiss, which was exhibited
on the Limerick platform by LoRD ARUNDEL, and which, it is reported,
was quite a marvel in its way. Those who have witnessed both Exhi-
bitions, declare they are puzzled which Kiss to 5. the preference to.
To avoid confusion, however, in the future annals of Art, they suggest
that The Kiss in the Exhibition should still retain its name, of “The
Amazon; ” whereas LoRD ARUNDEL's might be deservedly distin-
guished by the name of “THE AMAZIN' Kiss.”
A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION.
EveRYBody seems to think that we know everything, and the result
is, that we are asked all sorts of questions by all sorts of people. , The
last individual who has sought information from us, wishes to know
whether, in the event of the Crystal Palace being turned into a winter
garden, the exhibitors of machinery will leave all their plants?

PUNCH'S ANNIVERSARIES.—No. 2, FIRST CONTEST FOR DOGGETT'S COAT AND BADGE, AUGUST 1st, 1715,
OUR OWN WIEW OF THE ECLIPSE.
WE regret to say that—with reference to the late eclipse—we par-
ticipate in the views—amounting to no view at all—of the public in
eneral. We had made extensive preparations for the ceremony, an
ad smoked a large piece of glass, though, had we seen through the
affair before-hand, we should have paused ere we threw a stain on that
which had hitherto been perfectly spotless. At exhibitions in general,
it is a matter of complaint that there is nothing to be seen; but the
cause of our dissatisfaction with the solar exhibition extraordinary was
the fact, that we could see everything. The whole affair reminded us
of the intended feat of the man who was to get into a pint bottle. The
sun was to have been, on this occasion, the performer, and his attrac-
tion was to consist in his disappearance; but as he never appeared at
all, his powers—like those of the bottle conjuror—were not tested.
Extreme disappointment was occasioned to the public; for the per-
formance º was to have taken place before the eyes of Europe,
which were glazed expressly for the sight, ended in a sort of hole-
and-corner meeting between the sun and moon, behind a screen of
vapour.
The Safest of Railways.
THE Midland Railway Company has had the misfortune to be
damages on account of the death of a lady's husband,
which occurred through mismanagement on their line. No doubt this
sum, will be soon made up to them again by increase of excursion-
so much
for their servants' carelessness, is just that which one would prefer to
travel on.
Fashionable Movements in Rome.
THE Seventh Battalion of French Chasseurs, newly arrived from
France, to quarter in the offices of the Holy Inquisition; turning out
the º
The Tribunal of the Holy Inquisition—willy-nilly—to the Palace of
the Vatican.
A few more such movements on the part of the French army, and it
may recover somewhat of the ground lost since its occupation of Rome.
HIBERNIAN REPRESENTATIVES.
In the Committee on the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Bill, MR. Scully
is reported by the Times to have
“Protested against proceeding further with it at solate a period of the session, when
there were but very few Irish Members in town.”
But what is to be done, if the majority of the gentlemen alluded to
will run away the moment they suppose that Popish affairs are disposed
of for the Session? If they choose to devote themselves exclusively to
the Pope's concerns, instead of minding the business of their consti-
tuents, whose fault is that? MR. Scully ought to be glad that there
are those to be found who will attend to r old neglected Ireland.
But if English Members are to manage Irish matters and their own too,
the representation of England ought to be considerably extended; the
rather that the result of the next election will probably be the return of
an additional number of so-called Irish Members, who will in reality
represent nothing but the See of Rome.
A Stand for the Crystal Palace.
It was some time ago debated whether the Crystal Palace would
stand. There is no doubt that it will, if the nation will agree, to
keep it up. The question, therefore, now is simply as to the probability
of the people standing—and surely they will stand—a trifle for the
preservation of one of the chief wonders of the modern world.

T H E CAS E O F M I S T R E S S H | C K S.
Now list to me, ye Commons all,
Of mirth if ye i. fain,
The rather that there is a call
Upon me to explain.
A goodly tale I will you tell,
The case of MISTRESS Hicks;
Methinks it shall content you well
To hear about her tricks.
In Hyde Park she had owned a stall,
In sooth, for many a year,
And there she sold to children small
Fruit, cakes, and ginger-beer.
By Royal grant she held the same,
'Tis said—that I don't know—
I had heard nought of such a claim
Till some few weeks ago.
But not contented with the shop
Wherewith she did begin,
She begged a place to keep her “pop,”
And lock her bottles in.
The Board did tardily accede
To such a grave demand,
And Mistress Hicks, it was agreed,
Should have a wooden stand.
She wrote to thank them for the stand;
But wood for Mistress Hicks
Would not suffice;—with taste more
grand,
The lady asked for bricks.
But all this while, of Royal grant
No mention did she make,
But urged her prayers exorbitant
For fifteen children's sake.
A BALLAD FOR
| They granted bricks instead of wood,
With somewhat more ado;
The fact is, they were much too good;
And see what that led to
HERALDIC FRAGMENTS.
INCE our last number, we
have discovered that water-
bougets are, indeed, singular
objects. It would be easy
to bring a subscriber to the
water, but it would take a
good deal to make him drink
out of one of them; for we
never saw one blazoned that
looked at all fit for use, or
could compare, for practical
urposes, with an ordinary
jug. Indeed, the charming
feature about Heraldry now-
a-days is just this inappli-
cability of everything about
it to any use. All the beasts
look as if they were cramped
up by some Wombwellian ar-
rangement; lions are drawn
of imbecile appearance; and
warlike birds appear to be
stuffed. Some people, in-
deed, looking at these repre-
sentations, fancy they are
“all stuff” in a still more
comprehensive sense; but
perhaps they are just as like
the real animals as their
bearers are to the original
people who adopted them And so, perhaps, Heraldry may be said
to be somewhat typical still.
Hitherto, we have spoken chiefly of the bearing of animate objects,
and we hope in an animated manner.
borne in parts—parts of animals being as -
Strict rules attend the carving;
animals of parts are in general life.
Let us say a word of beasts
º in Heraldry as
though we regret that it is not generally the eatable part that is
Her stand she found was now too small
Therein her wares to stow,
And where to put her bottles all,
Forsooth, she did not know.
Again they weakly yielded here,
And said, to hold her store,
That MISTREss Hicks her stand might
rear
Just five feet high ; no more.
She thanked them at a mighty rate,
A grateful woman she
Now might she have a little grate
To make a cup of tea?
To this they never could assent;
They said her nay, right flat,
“Your hut was for your bottles meant;
A grate?—we can't stand that!”
The wily MISTREss Hicks, again,
Preferred another prayer;
Her little hut let in the rain,
The roof might she repair?
They said that she the roof might mend,
From wet to guard her stall,
But they would not the leave extend
To alter it at all.
But give an inch, and here’s the proof
Old wives will take an ell;
She very shortly had a roof
And chimney built as well!
LORD S-YM—R.
And into office when I came,
Besides all this, I found
A little garden, which our dame
Had fenced with hurdles round.
The hurdles Mistress Hicks had raised,
Because, forsooth, quoth she,
The people vexed her as they gazed,
And watched her at her tea.
The hurdles kept advancing still,
For all our men could say;
They spoke of her §º, ill;
I could not let her stay.

He told me that Isl , by rights,

She vowed she would not stir a bit,
And said it was her land.
The law did Mistress hicks displace;
We gave her something down,
Allowing, for a twelvemonth's space,
Her, too, a weekly crown.,
Such compensation will secure
Another stall and site
For those she holds not by a sure
And certain legal right.

To titled Rangers large amends
Impartial Justice makes,
But little to the dame that vends
Poor ginger-pop and cakes.
selected. We never hear of anybody's bearing a haunch of venison, for
example, which would look as if he was descended from some jolly
respectable fellow. But stags' heads are often carried with the horns
looking very threatening: where the head is severed clean off, it is
called couped; when torn off, erased. Alas! to allude to our friend the
Stag once more, how often has he been both cut and erased from
society within these few years! By-the-by, we may remark that a
Roebuck's head is not unfrequently carried; there is a Sootch family
that carries “three Roebucks' heads” in its shield, though we never
heard that any of them claimed to have three times more valuable a
headpiece than the honourable Member for Sheffield.
With regard to inanimate objects, there are, to begin with, nine
“Honourable Ordinaries”—daily, by-the-by, at six o'clock, or so
visible, variously, about the Park and the West-end, on carriages and
cabs. "There is the Chief, the Pale, the Fess, Bar, Bend, Bend Sinister,
lº Saltire and Cross. Each of these is marked by lines on
e Sillel (1.
The Chief is drawn horizontally, from left to right, across the upper
part of the shield. It is sometimes “indented,” and looks as if it
had been rather roughly rubbed against—which has happened to many
Chiefs, Whig and Tory, in our day. This is perhaps the most
dignified of Ordinaries: how natural, therefore, that the Douglasses,
who have an Ordinary of this class, should sport, as they do, three
“mullets * on it !
The Pale is formed by the perpendicular lines falling down the whole
area to the base—as occasionally happens to the pail of common life.
The Heralds tell us that the Pale was derived from palus, a stake—
and what better foundation than a steak could you have for an ordinary?
The old EARLs of MAR carried a l’ale; but they, poor gentlemen, have
long since kicked the bucket. When a shield is divided by a vertical
line, it is called party per pale—a division not without a meaning; many
a party being kept out of the social pale by a line equally clear.
A Chevron is that curious-looking figure which the reader may have
observed on shields, looking something like a letter A in an imperfect
state. It is so called from its resemblance to the rafters which support
a roof–called by the French a chevron. It is a curious coincidence,
which we state on the authority of Nisbett's Heralary, that certain
Scotch Paxtons wore two chevrons on their shield, long ago. Whether
they ever boasted of so much º: as our contemporary “raſters”
have produced, we are not prepared to say.

THE BOOK OF BISHOPS.
Punch believes it to be his mission to write The Book of Bishops, with
portraits of the most distinguished arithmeticians that at present adorn
the Bench., The Book of Bishops: a marrowy, dainty, volume, contain.
ing a simple and withal, popular, story of the manifold doings of the
men of lawn in this wicked world, with their º strugglings with
those sinewy giants of life L.S.D., that now and then will throw the
strongest in the dirt, the yellow dirt, that clings to, and yet begrimes not.
The Book of †† upon bank-note paper in ruby type—
bound in §. velvet, with gold edges; gold, inch-thick, and to be
had at all Cathedrals. . The Book of Bishops, uniformly printed with the
service of that Church, whose self-denying ordinances prelates of ten
thousand per annum so affectingly illustrate.
The hero of the past week—for every week, has its episcopal move-
ments, even as it has its police reports of vulgar fraud and embezzle-
ment—is the Bishop of RochestER; who, when Dean, showed the
profoundest respect for the spirit of antiquity, in the matter of twenty
grammar boys; as thus—
“By the Rochester statutes (says the Times), amongst other allowances, there are
allotted to the different classes of functionaries at that cathedral payments as follows:
—to the dean, £100; to six prebendaries, £20 each; to six minor canons, £10 each; to
the master of the grammar-school, £13 6s. 8d.; to the master of the choristers, £10; to
the second grammar master, £6 11s. 10d.; to twenty grammar boys, each, £1 13s. 4d. ;
and to four students at Oxford and Cambridge, £6 13s. 4d. each.”
Now the income of the Dean in 1840 is increased from his income of
1542, with a fine sense of the relative value of money at the two periods,
thus:-The DEAN or Rochester, (the present Bishop) in 1542 has
£150; but in the year of profit, 1840, his £150 expands into £1426
But what is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the É. inasmuch
as the scholars are not advanced a shilling from the sixteenth to the
nineteenth century!. The Rev. M.R. WHiston, stirs, in the matter;
and the dignitaries of the Cathedral call him “atheist.” The man does
not believe in the righteousness of Church embezzlement, and he is a
benighted infidel. That a Dean and Chapter should annually eat up
twenty grammar boys, and no blessing asked upon the yearly feast, by
the ReverEND MR. Whiston, shows in the minister a want of that
Christianity that said, “Suffer little children to come unto me!” .
In a very few days Punch will issue his prospectus for The Book of
Bishops; meanwhile the subject enlarges itself. “Matter,” says STERNE,
“grows under our hand; therefore let no man say, I will write a duode-
cimo.” Nevertheless, Punch will endeavour to make his Book of Bishops
no thicker than a Bishop's thumb–his golden thumb for all pockets.
THE ECLIPSE OUT OF ENGLAND.
UNCH has received from
his own astronomers
—and that, too, with
the greatestdespatch
—the fullest account
of the late eclipse of
the sun, as seen from
different points of
Europe. Some of
these reports, di-
vested of astronomi-
cal terms, are simply
as follow:—
Roy E. – Wery
dark, indeed; the
moon appearedsome-
thing e a Fisher-
man's ring – our
readers are, no
doubt, familiar with
the trinket—on the
disc of the sun;
wherever the ring
was visible, the light
of the sun was alto-
gether intercepted.
NAPLEs.-The sun was edged with blood; and the moon itself, now
looked like a bomb-shell, and now—as the man-in-the-moon showed
himself—a portrait of KING FERDINANn.
MADRID.—Here the moon appeared upon the sun elongated, thus, 0:
which cipher was interpreted as having some significant relation to
Spanish bonds.
VIENNA.--Total darkness: clouds shaped like a huge double i;
blotted out the sun: birds went to rest; and even the Ministry pulled
off their boots for bed, believing midnight conne.
PARIS.–The moon—as described by M. ARAgo—appeared like a
pitch plaster upon the face of the sun. Certain deputies, however,
declared it to be like a monstrous blot of censor's ink.
. Poor young Fop, he is greatly to be
pitied ? We should advise him to put
We are

PARTICULAR REASONS FOR PULLING DOWN THE
CRYSTAL PALACE.
HAT . accidentally produced a
º handsome building—which any metro-
E= polis might be proud of—is no reason
at all why it should be preserved.
That London, in fact, has so many
handsome buildings that an additional
one is not in the least wanted:
That the building, beautiful as it is,
is a perpetual eyesore in the eyes of
Belgravia, and blocks up the view
from the garret-windows of the houses
opposite.
}. it would be perfectly ridicu-
lous to maintain a building which only
took six months building, when there
are the Houses of Parliament which
are not finished yet, after the lapse of
- as many years. . .
That the building, if retained, would
only cost £140,000; which would be a downright absurdity by the side
of the Houses of Parliament, which have cost upwards of £2,000,000.
That, above all, it will be a perpetual source of temptation to the little
boys to break the windows.
A PRETTY LITTLE PICTURE FOR PRETTY LITTLE
PROTESTANTS.
(To be Admired some Twenty Pears hence.)
SUPPOSE we shift on the slides of the Magic Lantern of Time, and look
forward some twenty years hence. What do we see pictured before us?
We see a view of a magnificent Cathedral. It is embellished with
all the resources of Art. Sculptured Saints are pointing their marble
fingers in hundreds to heaven. Its mighty dome towers over the
crouching city, and spreads far and wide a long black shade, that seems
to wither up all the churches that surround it. Their lofty spires look
shrinking to the ground with fear, as if they felt themselves overawed
in the presence of such a monster rival. The interior is no less worth
of admiration. The i. ache to look at it. ..It is, one blaze of gold.
The altar shines like the front of a silversmith's shop, beautifully illu-
minated. In front of it is drawn out a long grenadier army of candles
—all burning to do honour to the brilliant scene. What is the name of
this magnificent Cathedral, that is pictured in such gorgeous colours
before us? It is St. Peter's, erected most appropriately in the centre
of the old Smithfield Market, and built by express command of His
SACRED HIGHNEss Pope PIUs The NINTh ! #. the side of it poor
St. Paul's lifts its head no higher than a toadstool. It is crushed—
reduced to a mere oyster-grotto—which every one passes, and not a
soul remembers.
The next, slide shows us a new view of this Cathedral. The people
begin to feel the tyranny of its oppression. The City longs to cast it off.
It seems to press with a heavyweight on its lungs, that º. its
breathing freely. You see a tumult takes place. . The populace refuses
to bow any longer to the Cardinal's hat. There is confusion—smoke—
fire-bloodshed; and we pass on to the next slide.
. This shows us the Cathedral surrounded with French troops—the
interior is likewise filled with them. Church service is performed at
the point of the bayonet. The altar is supported on French cannon,
ready charged. CARDINAL WISEMAN goes through High Mass with a
lighted match in his hand. Infidels are immediately converted by being
shot. Conversions take place every day, in hundreds and thousands,
till the Holy See is turned into a Sea of Blood. But at last the truths
of Popery are triumphant. St. Peter's is as great in London as St.
Peter's at Rome—thanks to that new Army of Martyrs—the Army of
the French Republic. -
Here the slides, stop, and all beyond it is darkness. But do the
slides we have already seen, portray the truth, or, are they, only
pictures of our own iºn?” Time, twenty years hence, will best
show. . For ourselves, we cannot help fearing that if we have a Pope's
Qathedral in London, the Pope's soldiers must soon follow. If the
Romish Church cannot maintain its ground in Rome, without the
aid of French guns, why should it do any better in London? If a soul
cannot be cured in Italy without the assistance of French saltpetre,
how can Pius THE NINTH cure English souls without calling in for us
the same remedy? In fact, this mixture of Romish piety and French
gunpowder seems to us so highly probable, that we suggest that the
new Cathedral, instead of being simply called St. Peter's, should, out
of compliment to one of its elements, allow itself to be christened
St. SALT PETRE's l—There is abundance of food for hope, however,
in this state of things; for the Church that has a Powder Mill for its
foundation, is sure at some future day to blow up.
THE WINTER GARDEN IN PARIS.
LoRD, CAMPRELI, anxious to know how the Winter, Garden
“worked” in Paris, sent over a Commissioner expressly to make
inquiries. The following is his report:
“I have visited the Jardin d’Hiver at Paris. I was prepared to see
the most terrible results of so false a system, but the reality has far
exceeded my most sanguine expectations. I have hardly recovered
from the effect of it yet.
. “All the visitors are Invalids. Infatuated mortals? The visit,
instead of doing them good, only makes them worse.
“You see nothing but pale faces; you hear nothing but coughs, and
sounds of pain. The combination is anything but agreeable.
“The debilitating effects are so º, that young ladies are
forbidden by their parents to attend the Garden, under any pretence
whatever.
“Physicians are always in attendance to pay attention to cases of
extreme exhaustion, . Two Physicians have already made their fortune.
“There is a small Infirmary attached to the Garden for the reception
of urgent cases.
“The Bills of Mortality have increased fearfully at Paris since the
establishment of the Jardin d’Hiver.
“A person who visits it more than once never escapes paying the
penalty of death for his rashness.
“There is not the slightest, doubt that the establishment of a
.. Garden in London would be attended with precisely the same
penally.
“The above are all the facts I have been able to accumulate, as
really, I had, not the courage to collect more information, having
already visited the deadly place six times.
“Your Honoured Commissioner,
“ (Signed) HENRY STRETCHER, M.D.”
WONDERS OF THE REFRESHMENT ROOM.
We are surprised at the apathy hitherto shown by the critics to the
wonderful efforts of art, which have been met with in the Refreshment
Room since the opening of the Exhibition. Our attention was, on a
recent visit, particularly directed to a section of a ham sandwich, con-
taining a small *: of ham, so beautifully attenuated as to be worthy
of weighing by the machine capable of appreciating the weight of a
millionth part of a scruple. We have also met, occasionally, with an
object—not very rare in the metropolis, but still, in its way, curious—
namely, a lukewarm ice. Some, electrical experiments may also have
been met with, occasionally, on the part of a waiter, who has now and
then exhibited a very shocking article very highly charged. These
experiments have occasionally given rise to a gratuitous lecture from
a waiter desirous of enlightening the public, but the result has not
always been as satisfactory as might have been desired.
Moral Reflection on France.
WE see that Lotteries are tolerated again in France—but the greatest
Lottery of all is decidedly the Government itself. We are afraid this
is a Lottery that is full of so many turns and strange revolutions, that
it will take years to alter it, much less suppress it. Every statesman
plays at it in the hope of gaining the Grand Prize. For instance, who
can tell what may turn up next year? . In the meantime, Louis
NAPOLEON is buying up as many tickets in the great Lottery as he can.
GREAT RIVAL TO PRINCE ALBERT.
THE clever performer at the Hippodrome, who ascends on the globe
up an inclined plane of fifty feet, and then goes down again, has been
described as “a Great Rival to PRINCE ALBERT-ſor he moves in the
very highest circles, and every day of his life walks on the Slopes.”
A Refreshing Conundrum.
WHY do young misses, and boarding-school young ladies, at the
Exhibition, refuse to lunch at any other refreshment-stall than the one
in the Transept *
Because they like a “Young-HUSBAND,” and object to having
“MASTERs.”
The BEST MAN TO SETTLE THE MINUTES.
As MR. BROTHERTON has his eye generally upon the clock, we should
say he would be the best man in the House “to settle the minutes.”
MovemENTs of THE ARIstocracy.—LoRD ARUNDEL has gone down

72 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI.
LAST Toosday, SIR.”
SAVE ME. PAXTON AND THE CRYSTAL PALACE FROM
ITS FRIENDS.
PUNCH regrets to see a spirit of destructiveness among the Peerage,
some of whom are for pulling down the Crystal Palace—an act that
i would have the effect of bringing a large quantity of iron, and a still
| larger quantity of well-merited irony, about our ears. We have great
respect for LoRD CAMPBELL, as a very good judge, but he has shown
himself a very bad judge in this one particular; and though he acknow-
| ledges himself proud of the friendship of MR. Paxton, we are afrai
we shall be obliged to save the latter from his noble friends, if they
evince their friendship by endeavouring to destroy what ought to be a
rpetual monument to his merits. LoRD CAMPBELL ought to have a
#. for a brother architect, who has triumphed over
difficulties—for his º as the truly illustrious architect of his
own fortune, should sympathise with MR. Paxton, as a labourer in the
same laudable school of architecture—and protect his work against the
ignorance and prejudice of those who think an aristocratic neighbourhood
. be injured by bringing to it a place of popular recreation or
resort.
The million—for we may here use the word in its literal sense—who
have frequented the Crystal Palace, have shown, by their conduct, that
there is no reason in either repelling or running away from them, inas-
much as Royalty itself has suffered no inconvenience from the closest
contact. We know LoRD CAMPBELL, in his energetic discharge of his
judicial duties, has the strongest ºl. to anything in the shape of
a remanet, but the Crystal Palace should at least be an exception to his
scruples—against allowing any thing, to remain. We cannot, for a
moment, imagine that the fact of his Lordship. living immediatel
opposite, is the cause of his opposition to the building being preserved.

THE Board of Health has been aspersed and vilified for
having done little or nothing towards the prevention of
intramural interments. The EARL or SHAFTESBURY, on
his legs the other night, satisfactorily vindicated the Board
from the charge, by a statement of facts, which he con-
cluded by saying, “That was the sum of their proceedings.”
By the noble Earl's account it seems that the sum of their
proceedings amounts to £0,0s. 0d.,, which in order to
carry out the requisite proceedings under the Metropolitan
Interments Act of last session—is all they can get from
Government.

The Rival Fathers.
A LITTLE Boy having asked his intelligent Papa what
was the difference between the Papal Hierarchy and the
Episcopal Bench, the parent replied, “Now that the Eccle-
siastical Titles Bill hasº my little dear, our Bishops

reverend fathers.”
Should the Constituencies go on returning Jews to the
Mouse of Commons, and should the Lords persevere in re-
fusing to admit the elected to Parliament, a row of stalls
should be partitioned off in the Lower House, for what
might properly be called the “reserved” seats.
LULLABY ON THE RAIL.
THE Globe contains the particulars of an accident which happened,
the other night, on the South-Western Railway, near Bishopstoke, in
consequence of the engine-driver and fireman both falling asleep on
their posts. We never heard of a more remarkable case of somnolence
than that of an engine-driver sleeping under such circumstances, and
his fireman helping him in so doing. MoRPHEUs might assume these
slumberers as supporters to his arms: for which they would be more
d|suitable than lions, dormant, or dormice proper. The Seven Sleepers
were less extraordinary fellows than these two: however, we hope to
hear of no more, such sleepers on a railway. They certainly deserve a
testimonial, which, it may be surmised, should be the sack; but, as our
contemporary states, that
“Both men were perfectly sober when they started with the train but were greatly
fatigued, having been up, they stated, for two days and nights,”
it may be a question whether the compliment should not be paid in the
shape of a new velvet-nap apiece; and, as the legs of one of them were
severely injured, if not broken, whether his employers ought not to put
some additional remuneration into his hat.
Strange Difference of Antipathies.
RACHEL was compelled to discontinue her performance the other
evening in consequence of the opposition of a Dog, which had been
accidentally introduced into the theatre. With French performers it
is the bark of a Dog, apparently, that puts a stop to the performance;
now, with English performers it is, generally, the Catcall !

THE RURAL MIND ON THE RETURN FETES
AT PARIS.
SAYs old SquTRE CLoD unto young SQUIRE Pole
*Here’s the rummest news ſºve heard of since I was a foal;
The LoRD MAYOR of London, and a lot more beside,
Be gone over to Paris, nigh a week for to bide.”
Says young SQUIRE Pole unto old SQUIRE CLOD,
“This here information is curious and odd;
But what be 'em gone for?—I pray you explain.”—
“Oh, to feast wi'a chap called Perfect of the Seine.
“There is goin’ to be a terreable to-do;
I read it in the paper, which always speaks true:
Balls, concerts, sham-fighting, and fountains at play,
And singin' at the Uproar, where they turns night to day.”
“And what is the reason of all this set-out?”—
"Oh! the Crystal Zibition; that’s what it’s about;
Return eatin’-matches, ’tis what you may call–
To come off agin them as was play'd at Guildhall.”
“For eatin’ and drinkin' I never would roam,
And I think a Lord Mayor med as well bide at home.”—
“Yes, I see, they’re to feed off a Paris quizzeen;
That’s fricasseed frogs, mun; we knows what they mean.”
“I’d touch none of their messes.”—“No more wouldn't I.”—
For a rump-steak and inions, is what I would cry.”—
'But I wish you med get it.”—“And then, only think
Of the varjuicy wine that they’ll give 'em to drink.”
“But I don’t bepity’em one mossel nor mite;
They'd no business to go there; it sarves 'em quite right.”—
“Ah, they’ll find their mistake out !—they’d better stopt here,
Instead of gallivantin' where they won't get no beer.”
-->
“But when they returns, mum, what figgers they’ll be *—
‘Such scarecrows, depend on’t, as never you see.”—
“Just fancy a mayor in a beard and a blooze | *—
“Ees, and then they will learn 'em to wear wooden shoes.”.
“This Crystal Zibition, I always had fears,
Would lead to our mixin’ with French foreigneers.”—
...That’s true, but then quiet and pace it per-motes,
Which is better than cuttin' of each other's throats.”
“There is rason in that: I hates bloodshed and scars;
But just think what wheat was a load in the wars.”—
“Well, and that’s true agen; but then what did we get?
Why, the answer to that is the National Debt.”
20, though hopin' we never shall learn foreign ways,
eace and comfort's my maxim.”—“And that’s what I says.
Come, let’s have t'other bottle; a tooast I’ll gee,

THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE CAB-STAND.
INDEPENDENCE has reached those who—to use a vulgar expression—
are literally “carriage folks;” for the true men of substance, of the
present day, are the cab-drivers. The test of respectability used to be
the keeping of agig; but, in these days, the keeping of a cab–especially
a Hansom-begins to be a test of affluence. Our men of rank—that is
to say, of cab-rank—are really our men of capital. So vast are their
earnings in the day-time, that, in the night, there is scarcely a cab to be
had either for love—if it is not an absurdity to talk of love towards a
cab-driver—or for, money. No sooner have the toils of the day gone
by, when all a cabman's best feelings begin to possess him; he casts
his “rank” aside, and mixes with his fellow-men, giving up to mankind
what was meant for parties—inasmuch as at parties the guests have
to walk home, for want of a cab to carry them. We are always ready
to rejoice in the prosperity of a class, but we really wish the cab-drivers
who have made their fortunes would retire totally, instead of partially,
and leave the stands to those who would find it worth their while to
§ the demand of the public in the evening as well as in the
y-llme.
Legacy Duty Unpaid.
NELson left his daughter as a legacy to the Nation. The legacy
has been left now for several years; but we have never yet heard of
the Legacy having been taken up, or even the Duty attended to; and
this in, mind you, spite of .NElsós's well-known injunction that “Eng-
land expects every man will do his duty.”

AN EXCLUSIONIST JOKE.
T is not often that we have

bear from the following, even
though it savours a leetle of

A YOUNG LADY'S OPINION AS TO WIHAT SHOULD
BE DONE WITH THE CRYSTAL PALACE,
“OH ! My DEAR PUNCH,--I am a young lady—which I should have
felt great diffidence in telling you—only you know everything—and
besides, I go to all the Fêtes—and so, where would have been the good
the truth from..". I must tell you, then, that my pocket-
money is exceedingly small: papa, says he can't afford to give me any
more; and, though dear mamma is as kind as she can be, still she is as
fond of going to the Fêtes as I am; and you don’t know what a deal of
money that costs. I can’t sleep sometimes when I think about it. I
should be so happy, and would go everywhere, if I had plenty of money.
As it is, I am frequently obliged to stop at home-and I don't like it.
“It isn't so much the money we spend in tickets that we care for, as
the expensive dresses we are obliged to wear... I don’t half like talkin
to you about such things. I’m afraid you’re laughing at me; but st
I don't mind, and will go on to say that the dresses are wearing our
hearts out; and I don’t know what I shall do for a new bonnet (not
“an ugly,”—I hate them) to go to the sea-side with. I have had so
many new dresses, that I shall have no money left to read a single novel
this year on the sands. It’s all the fault of our climate—and why we
have such a climate I cannot tell. It’s always raining at the very time
you don't want it to rain—just as if it did it purposely to spite you.
“It rained the first Horticultural Fête-and my dress was spoiled.
“It rained the second Horticultural Fête, and a beautiful new bonnet
—quite a duck, with the exception that it wouldn’t take the water—
was completely sacrificed. - -
“And the third Fête, you know how it rained! There wasn't a bit
of room in any one of the tents; and the consequence was, that every:
thing I had on was ruined—so much so that I could have cried, if I
wasn’t afraid some one would have seen me.
“And we fared very little better at the Botanical Fêtes. I am not
clever at counting. I can only tell you that each time the rain came
down (and didn't it come down just last Wednesday?) I had to pay for
it most dearly, in the most provoking sense of the word. A lady cannot
wear a waterproof bonnet, or a Mackintosh pelérine, as you gentlemen
do. One drop of water, and, like a bright stove (pray excuse me), our
lustre is gonel
“You must confess, my dear Punch, that the loss of so many dresses
in one season must be very heart-breaking to a poor girl, whose pocket-
money is as low as my spirits at the present moment. I couldn't help
thinking how nice it would have been if the Botanical Fête, last
Wednesday, had only been held in the Crystal Palace' I shouldn’t
have cared for the rain then... I shouldn't have got wet feet. My
parasol wouldn't have had all the colour (it was a light cerise) com-
pletely washed out, and we could have walked in comfort, and have
enjoyed the society ever so long-till tea-time. -
“I am told that the Crystal Palace is to be pulled down. , Dear
Punch, if you allow it, I will never forgive you; It is the only place in
London where we ladies can walk about in, without fear of getting wet.
It is a large glass Parasol, under which we can laugh at the rain that is
pattering over our heads, and snap our º at our wretched English
climate. Pray let it remain up, and then—who knows—the Horticultural
Fêtes may be held inside it next year, and we shall no longer have to
go all the way to Chiswick to be caught in a shower of rain, and we
shan’t have to buy so many dresses, which is not pleasant, in the course
of the season. Do this, and you will confer, like a good fellow, as I am
sure you are, a great favour on tº ONE who Loves You DEARLY.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CRYSTAL FESTIVAL IN PARIS.
PARIs and London embrace,
and give and take the kiss
of peace under the re-
membered dome of the
rys Palace. In the
Hôtel de Wille, Paris, are
celebrated the triumphant
utilities of the world-wide
fair of Hyde Park. All
folks of all degrees asso-
ciated with the origin and
completion of the great
work, are invited to eat,
N/ drink, dance, gaze, and be
\\!/ merry, at the cost of the
º, French Republic. The pro-
ºf gramme of the festivities is
- Y”; full and very various.
A dinner and a concert on
the Saturday; waterworks
and fountains at Versailles,
on Sunday; on the Monday,
a grand fête at St. Cloud,
under the patronising brow
of the President; on Tuesday, a ball—multitudinous as a geometric
dance of summer gnats—of 8000, shakes the foundations of the
Hôtel de Ville; and on Wednesday, as a conclusion of fireworks
and finale of smoke—“A review and sham-fight in the Champ de
Mars!” . Of all sham-fights that were ever feignedly fought, this
Wednesday fight—circumstances considered—should be registered as
the greatests of all. The powder white powder; noiseless, smoke-
less, the battle of a dream; a visionary flash-in-the-pan, with no
true fire. For, says the programme, the occasion of the visitors so
honoured and so regaled,—
“May do much to cement the more intimate connection between the two nations,
whose mutual relations must be beneficial. In fact, following up the impression made
by the Grand Exhibition of Industry of all Nations, this visit to our Parisian neigh-
bours may be made the real Peace Congress, divested of long speeches and Utopian ideas.”
There can be no doubt that the sham-fight was fought, not only in
honour of the Peace Congress, but in illustration of the madness and
folly of war, as set forth and preached at its gatherings. MR. CoBDEN
might use the thousands of soldiers with their arms and artillery, even
as a lecturer employs manipulations to prove his arguments. “Imagine,”
says MR. CoBDEN, “that these roaring guns have belched and
spluttered showers of shot into compact masses of human creatures;
believe that those mortars have flung shells into a city, blowing up the
habitations of industrious men, and burying whole families in a fiery
tomb! Behold the smoke cleared away; and then picture upon the
field ten thousand human creatures, dead, or dying, in every horrible
condition of human agony, and then make answer, and—as you are a
rational creature, endowed with an immortal soul for an immortal
destiny—say, wherefore such strife, such sacrifice, such cost of blood
and cost of wealth (which, wrung by taxation, may be blood, though
not shed in war)—when the ennobling aspirations of man should make
reason, not, force, the arbitrator? Brains, not balls—hearts, not
howitzers ?”. And in this way, as we conceive, MR. $.". as a
member of the Crystal Palace Commission, may turn to profit the
sham-fight of the Champ-de-Mars. -
Haply, too, MR. THoMAs CARLYLE may eloquently preach thereon.
For has he not sent, a letter—a veritable palm-leaf-to the Peace
Congress sitting in Exeter Hall? A letter in which—said the news-
paper reports—were weighty words of sympathy and approvalº. There-
fore, it was not too much to hope that CARLYLE himself, smiting with
root of olive tree, the hollow drum, would prove to a reflecting world
what an empty wind-box that tambour is
‘Long speeches and Utopian ideas?” Poor Utopia; ever º at
as a fiction, a flam; though in some way ever palpably under our feet
and round about us. Do we not live, and have firm footing in what
was the Utopia of our ancestors? ...Call up GeoRGE THE THIRD : take
him a trip by the rail: let him receive a letter by the penny-post; then,
let him answer the aforesaid letter by electricity. Thus the Utopia
of ºnce. of prejudice, becomes the solid globe of practised
knowledge.
What a curious picture-gallery might be collected of the portraits of
succeeding Utopians! Of such dreamers as GALILEo and HERVEY, and
NEWTON, and JENNER, and WATT, and STEPHENson, and WHEATstone
and Rowland HILL, and—(he is now the newest; for he-poor
enthusiast—dreams of a Winter Garden)—and Joseph Paxton'ſ
-º-yº.
It would seem that the Lords, in resisting the admission of Jews
to Parliament, would convert, every Jew so elected into a standing
joke, rather than allow him to be a sitting member. -

tion put to LORD LANSDown E

ship, “I am afraid not.” The
Minister also wisely said—“It
was an established maxim of the

with bishops in Utopia to preach
the loveliness of self-denial to
all other persons, the episcopal
preachers themselves taking
=--- Sermon.
. “Shining lights deserve pre-
cious candlesticks.”. A yery good saw, this, of the old divine, full of
the belief of the Christian uses of splendid bishoprics. Now the
Bishop of LoNDoN is fast in this creed of sumptuosity; not even
MR. HoRsMAN shall convert him to the pauper faith of the primitive
fathers. Blomfield is a shining light; and of virgin gold flashing
with many a carbuncle, with many a healing, episcopal amethyst, is
the candlestick of Fulham. How could Bishops burn the true light
Aptly, beautifully, did Bishop BioMFIELD plead for the necessity of
a Protestant church at Rome, “where the extermal and internal
decorations are proportional to the important sacred objects to which
they are applied:” and—can we doubt it?—the Bishop of LoND9N can
lay his hand upon his pocket, and avouch his belief that a bishop of
£20,000 a year-ground-rents and leases included—is at once a proper
external and internal decoration of a Christian temple. ...Self-denial
being the spirit of Christianity, money-changing, lease-granting bishops
faith. And this is now a daily spectacle, at which the profane laity
stare with something more than wonderment; a market-dealing in the
Temple at which backsliding dissent thrusts its tongue in its cheek,
and wags its irreverent head. Do we want a constant farce—an hourly
burlesque for the laughter of the heathen * We have it in the doings
of certain Churchmen, whose creed it is to be simple fishers of men;
but whose acts are the rapacity of rovers. PETER’s boat has too often
become a privateer; nay, when it is very hazy weather, it is difficult
always to make out the Lamb in the ensign of the boat pushed from the
willowy bank of Fulham.
But to return to Rome—(by the way, not so great a distance as
upon one time reckoned from the Thames, Fulham side, to Tiber).-
The Bishop of LoNDoN said:
“It is true that there is a granary at Rome used as a Protestant
chapel by our countrymen: and that it is large enough for those who
usually attend it: but—”
And here the Bishop—as becomes a Bishop of his yearly in-comings
—touches upon the want of external and internal decorations; a want,
no doubt, acutely felt by a prelate with a particularly fine eye to church
effect; to what the slang of criticism calls the mise en scène of a
tºº. and originally got up under the smiling sanction of BLOMFIELD
innseil.
Pio Nono-it is believed—will allow no better temple to Protestants
than that afforded by a granary; whilst, at the same time, he has
published proposals for building a rival cathedral in London, pitting
against God's St. Paul's, a Pope's St. Peter's And, it is said, the
subscriptions are coming in; brought down by indulgence—the Pope's
judgments. The spirit of TETZEL–if we may believe London's Bisho
—goes about England with his pedlar's box; selling salvation to |
purchasers; and snipping bits of redemption to fine ladies, as a mercer
snips riband.
nd if this really be so, whose the fault? If we are to have a
St. Peter's in London, who has really laid the first stone of that Pope's
fortress, another battery thrown up to awe the liberty of human
thought Have no prelates worked both consciously and uncon-
- - - Has not St. BARNABAs had flowers stuck
in his button-hole by a Protestant prelate; tapers put between the
º thousand a year. In one year, how many Dissenters are made
by the Bishop's yearly gold; a sum levied in the name of Christian
self-denial; and oft ... in the spirit of a Roman Praetor? What
LoRD FAlkland said, may now be repeated with even a more sor-
Lord-|W
some ten thousand a year for the h
the, daughter.” , Many a Protestant, prelate is the spiritual father
of thousands of backsliders. An Established Church, with her founda-
tions laid in the Bank cellars! An Established Church, with her
Bishops, so many eyeless SAMsons, tearing down her pillars!
And with these thoughts, the Christian Fº of London's Bishop on
the granary temple, the Protestant chapel at Rome, does not melt us.
e are even content that Protestants (“it is large enough for those
who usually attend it”) should continue to prefer their prayers beneath
the simple roof, where grain was hoarded : grain, it may be, winnowed
from chaff and husk; a type of purity not wholly useless to the
thoughts of pious worshippers, Indeed, that granary church may, in
its rudeness, in the very nakedness of its K. preach the intrinsic
purity of Christianity: may show in beautiful contrast to the Cathedral
of St. Peter's; that, spiritual stithy where, amidst blearing pomp, at
which the heart sickens, with muttered incantations, and mystic
dronings, the spiritual fetters of the human soul are forged; made red-
hot in purgatorial fires, and hammered and fashioned by Vulcan Pro
and his Cyclops Priests. - -
Opposed to St. Peter's, blazing with gold, and foul with incense,
ow much more like a Christian temple, that naked, unadorned granary;
even should it retain some odour of its past uses, some hint of the
bread by which men live?
Nevertheless, let us believe in the sorrow of the Bishop of LoNDoN
that a Christian service should be performed, shorn of what he believes
to be its internal and external decorations;-gold and velvet within,
and Bishops and Pluralists without, being of them. Let us believe in
the º and then, must we not ask of him—“Are there not in
England churches no better, than granaries? Are there not English
ministers with salaries no higher than the wages of millers’ men P Why
weep over the granary Church at Rome, when the granary Churches
of England and Wales may, at your own will, be transformed to
temples P. And then, how many well-appointed Preachers of the Word
—men whose office should be their best worldly pomp-might be
obtained from the superfluities of the Bishop of LoNixon f°
In the meantime, we can bear with the Protestant Granary at Rome.
It may seem in us wicked infidelity to a Bishop of £30,000 per annum;
but we can calmly entertain the idea of worship offered up in a granary,
to that Divinity that first beamed on men from a manger.

RULES FOR THE BETTER BEHAWIOUR OF
HONOURABLE MEMBERS.
LoRD John Russell has º: up the Report of the Committee
appointed to inquire into the order in which Hon. Members should
roceed to the House of Peers, whenever their attendance is requested
y HER MAJESTY. The recommendations of the Committee are so
curious, that they remind us more of the instructions given by a Beadle
to a troop of charity children, as to how they are to fall into procession
when they go to church, and how they are to behave there, and in what
way they are to come away from it. On our word—which, on a matter
of profound ridicule, no one would think of doubting—the recommenda-
tions of the Committee are fully as ridiculous as the following:—
As not more than a certain number of little boys can attend the
Bar of the House of Lords at the same time, every little boy who
wishes to go must send in his name to his Master (the SPEAKER) a full
week in advance.
The Master (the SPEAKER) shall take all the names; and for each
name he shall take a penny-piece, which number of penny-pieces he
shall divide into an equal number of “heads and tails.”
As a general rule, the clever Members shall represent the “heads,”
and the Irish Members, and public agitators, the “tails.” -
The Speaker shall then take the º; and put them into a
large pewter-pot, in which he shall shake them as long as he pleases, after
which, in presence of the assembled House, he shall throw them on the
green-baize table.
If there is a greater number of heads uppermost after the throw,

then the “Heads” of the House shall be allowed to go and stare at

instantſ
HER MAJEsty. But if there is a majority of “Tails,” then the House
must not get more angry than it can help at being represented, during
the royal interview, by the Irish Members.
During the interview, the following rules must be strictly attended
to:-
The boys must form in a procession of four abreast. The big boys
must go first, and the little boys afterwards. ..
They must not sing, nor whistle, nor catch flies, nor make faces, nor
crow, nor bray, nor give way to any juvenile imitations, as they enter
the House of Lords. - -
No little boy must jump on the shoulders of another little boy in the
presence of Her Majesty. -
All games of peg-top, pitch-and-toss, highcockalorum, and scratch-
cradle are strictly forbidden whilst HER MAJESTY is speaking.
Any little boy found “taking a sight” at the Lord CHANCELLOR, or
any of the Peers, will be instantly expelled the House,
And lastly, any little boy convicted by his Master (the SPEAKER) of
breaking any of the above rules, will never be allowed permission to
attend the Hºle of Lords a second time.
**
Really, from the very grave manner in which the Committee has laid
down its absurd recommendations, one would imagine that Members
are no better than Common Councilmen, and that they are in the habit
of “mobbing” the Queen every time she goes to Parliament, in the
same vulgar manner as aldermen and tradesmen do, when she goes to
a ball in the City. There is very little difference, it would appear,

The Long and the Short of it.
MR. CHAPLIN said, at a railway meeting, that “it had been remarked
that when the speeches were long, the dividend was always short.”
This is not unlike our Houses of Parliament, where the speeches are
much too long, and the dividend (of public good) far too short. We
wonder if reversing the system—which has been tried long enough—
would be attended with a contrary effect. Perhaps if the speeches
were shorter, the dividends might be longer; or, better still, perhaps if
there were no speeches at all, the dividends might attain that extreme
length that nothing short of the abolition of the National Debt would
be the end of it!
We recommend a trial by all means, as there is everything to gain,
and nothing to lose by it!

PUNCH*S LUMBER-TROOPER IN PARIS.
RACIousLY wishing to give a most original
account of the sham-fightfought in bonour
of the English visitors at Paris, Punch,
wholly regardless of expense, entered
into arrangements with CAPTAIN FLASH-
INPAN of the Lumber Troop, to supply
the article. The Captain has served (as
defendant) in several actions; and has
also seen some service in the Fleet.
“Hötel de Caniche, August 7.
“MR. PUNch,--I have the honour to
sit down, covered with dust, to give you
the details—from a bird’s-eye view—of
- one of the most glorious sham-fights ever
yet fought upon the field of fiction. If I know the hearts of
yourself and readers, you will, I know, pardon me, if at the earliest
paragraph, I state that the LoRD MAYOR is safe! His left whisker
was blown off in an early part of the day; which necessitated the
shaving of the right; his Lordship, as a British merchant, knowing
the propriety of a proper balance, MR. ALDERMAN SALOMONs—(he im-
rudently appeared in real gold epaulets as a City Artilleryman of the
Red Sea division)—was surprised, and carried off by the enemy on the
first attack; but was returned “better as new,’ in the handsomest
manner to his hotel in the ...; -- - -
“The morning broke beautifully; and—it being 95 in the shade—
there was every belief that the river would be hotly disputed. The
Champ de Mars was on the left of the Seine; the Trocadero and the
Bois de Boulogne, on the right. Out of compliment to the LoRD
MAYOR, who was dressed as a full general of Lancers, and seated in a
tribune, flanked on each side by a dozen of London porter—the troops
on the left began to move en echellon across the river, to the ‘Roast
Bef of Old England.’ Their fire was gallantly received—as much of it
as came—by the troops on the right.
“Here, however, the troops from the Trocadero deployed at double-
Quick, time, all but turning the flank of a pontoon. Success would
have been certain, only at this critical juncture a battery threw off its
mask, and played away in real earnest. To form a hollow square, and
so cover the counterscarp—materially weakened by the artillery of the
enemy—was only the act of fifteen minutes. And then * * * *
* * * But here, I regret to say that the increased firing prevented
my seeing anything but clouds of smoke, that rolled in the most magni-
ficent manner to the other side of the river.
. “At this moment a splendid movement was made by the Cara-
bineers, determined to carry the post of the enemy, or, perish in the
attempt, when—[I am again compelled to omit details, the smoke being
thicker than ever.]
... Here a brilliant charge was made, when—[Smoke].
“Covering the heights, and then deploying to the left, the artillery
of the enemy blazing away, and—[Consequently more smoke).
“The smoke clearing off here occurred one of those heart-delighting,
soul-subliming, incidents that make war the game of demigods. I have
already said the day was hot: at this moment the mercury stood at
20; when—the smoke cleared off. Then might be seen both armies
nearing the banks of the Seine. The men approached each other fear-
lessly; threw down their caps and muskets; talked to one another about
Le grand Mairé de Londres—Le Palais Parton—Ponche—and so forth.
All asperity of feeling seemed forgotten Cigars were about to be
exchanged, when suddenly the bugles sounded; the drums beat to
arms; the rival soldiery embraced;, parted with mutual expressions
of fraternity; and, before you could say “Jack Robinson,’ were again
at the bayonet's point. Then, the stupid philosopher would have
º why not shake hands for good, and throw away bayonets for
ever ? But the cannon roared: i again war—magnificent, glorious
war—was [Smoke-smoke-smokej -

CAUTION.
WHHHHAs a quantity of FRENCH MONEY is in Circulation, this
CAUTION is given to all young Englishmen who are in the habit of going to
places of Public Amusement, to look carefully at the Silver they receive in exchange
19F their Gold ; or, otherwise, they will pocket a loss of One Shilfing and Threepence,
if not more, upon every Five-Franc Piece they receive in lieu of a Five-Shilling Ditto;
to say nothing of the additional loss of Twopence, at the very least, for every miserable
Franc that is palmed upon them for an honest Shilling; in addition to a further
ºl, preciation in the value of every Sovereign, caused by a number of paltry little
ten-sous pieces being substituted for an equal number of valuable Sixpences.
(Signed) COLONEL PUNCH,
Inspector-General of Moral Police.
THE SONG OF THE PUMP;
As supposed to have been sung at the Grand Teetotal Demonstration
of August 4.
How sad the delusion—how great the mistake—
That punch cures gout, cholic, and phthisic;
That it j any ailment, relieves the least ache,"
Or in any way answers as physic! -
And, oh! how fallacious the doctrine they teach-
Those unphilosophical thinkers–
Who would make you believe that care never can reach
The souls of deep-swilling wine-drinkers!
'Tisn't true that the lover, when pallid with grief,
Can from toping derive consolation; ..
Taking glass after glass will afford no relief,
But lead only to intoxication. -
When they †. there’s nothing to tipple like beer,
That it best suits the human interior, .
Don’t believe them; pump-water, salubrious and clear,
Is in ev'ry respect far superior.
Cups of kindness to quaff is completely absurd,
t is silly to pledge friends at table;
Why not be content to wish health with a word,
Since to wish it is all that you’re able P
What an error with drink when you servants repay,
Or workmen excite to exertion |
They care not for grog or malt-liquor, not they !.
º, ; they hold such rewards in aversion.
How erroneous the notion that funerals are made
Less mournful, or weddings more merry,
By anything stronger than nice lemonade—
By your claret, champagne, port, or sherry !
A ºpitºl. playhouse, or church, when you found,
Ah! why must the liquor be flowing?
When a beadle's sworn in, or a bishop enthroned,
Why are bottles and barrels set going?
When you christen a baby, what need you to sip
Strong liquor? you’d better not take it. . .
Wy not do as you do when you christen a ship?
ave your bottle, but fling it and break it.
This, this is the way, boys, your bottle to crack,
In F. so genial and hearty; -
And I’m sure a companion you never will lack,
If I can be one of your party.
PALMERSTON THE FRIEND OF ITALY.
LoRD PALMERSTON.—he announced the fact amid the cheers of the
House—has had copies of MR. GLADSTONE’s pamphlet on the atrocities
of the KING. of NAPLEs sent to our Ministers at the various Courts of
Europe. When a murderer, a burglar, or a footpad commits a crime,
the description of the culprit is printed in the Hue and Cry, and sent to
all police offices. KING FERDINAND's portrait, drawn from demoniac
life, is by this time in the hands of our Ambassadors and Consuls.
How is it painted?
“Head, big as biggest bomb-shell; and filled with the same diabolical materials.
Mouth, a faux Averni-nose, the Bridge of Sighs.”
LoRD PALMERSTON praised MR., GLADSTONE for not diving into
volcanoes and exploring excavated cities: but, on the other hand, for
ing to Neapolitan Courts of Justice, and descending into dungeons.
is Lordship counselled other English gentlemen to copy MR.
GLADston E's example; counsel more easily F. than followed: for,
doubtless, the KING of NAPLEs will not feel so much flattered by the
GLADSTONE portrait, as to sit for other copies.
Amy way, the KING
FERDINAND, gibbeted by the English printer, now dangles in the office
We trust that the
of every English embassy. And this is something.
ORD PALMERSTON an
Friends of Italy will lose no time in electing
honorary and honoured member.
By-the-way, MR. CochRANE–who has written a book, in which he
shows the King of NAPLEs as a King of Maccarone, a most charming
and, to his subjects, most nutritious King–MR. CochRANE threw
himself between DE LAcy Evans and the Royal Bomb-shell. There
is an old proverb-
Un Inglese Italianato
E un diavolo incarnato.
As MR. CochRANE, nominally represents an English constituency,
let him cultivate English feelings. If the KING of NAPLEs is to have
a lucifer to show his merits, let not the match be British oak tipped
with Neapolitan brimstone.

PUNCH's ANNIVERSARIES.—No. 3. HENRY, EARL OF RICHMOND, LANDED AT MILFORD
ON HIS ENTERPRISE AGAINST RICHARD THE THIRD, AUGUST 7th, 1485.
HAVEN,
THE LORD MAYOR'S ARRIVAL ON THE
SHORES OF FRANCE.
The moment it was known that the Civic Mayoralty had selected
Boulogne as the spot which the civic pumps should first press on their
| visit to the shores of France, that impulsive watering-place was all alive
—from the tip of the feather of the hat of the tall Swiss to the lowest
welt on the highlow of the smallest drummer. By an early hour, the
flags of all nations—among which we recognised some decided
Bandannas—were floating round a square *. on the F; presentin
the gay appearance of an extensive pocket-handkerchief drying-ground,
Orl i. morrow of an enormous washing-day.
During the forenoon, an immense sensation was created by the
bringing out, of the steam-boat ladder, dressed out, in party-coloured
calico, and giving it the aspect of the car of a balloon—an incident
which gave rise to a rumour of some intended aeronautic exploits on the
part .#the civic authorities. . Curiosity continued to heighten with the
iide; and when the paguebot was signalled in the distance, enthusiasm
was with difficult ſ: within bounds by a square of ropes enclosing
the space reserved for the authorities. It was gratifying to observe
the immense number of officials who turned out, upon this occasion;
almost every one of whom seemed to have entitled himself, not only to
a cocked hat, a feather, and a sword, but to a medal, or series of medals,
for some services rendered to his country. - -
The head Custom-House officer was in the fullest*...* regimentals,
and his bosom groaned under a perfect galaxy of stars, in token, no
doubt, of his havin; been present at the taking of all the luggage—and
at other similar exploits. The gallant corps of Douamiers, or Custom-
House officers, whose swords have no doubt pierced many a question:
able parcel, and whose guns have battered many a set of contraband
crockery-ware on the spot, attended by their £º. band of five
trumpeters and fourteen drummers; while a detachment of the line
stood in a state of zig-zag, which seemed to be the result of eagerness
to catch an early view of le fameur Lord Maire de Londres. At length
the one cannon on the port announced, avec explosion, that the boat had
entered the harbour; and on the signal ºf heard, a trumpeter,
rushing to the front-door of the Custom House, blew a blast, which, by
running rapidly to the back-door of the building, he ingeniously
contrived to echo.
At length the vessel came alongside, and the authorities, all scrambling
for front places, for a time blocked up the gangway. The first glimpse
of the distinguished party presented something like the chequered aspect
of a chess-board; an effect produced by the alternation of black hats
and white basins, which were the most conspicuous objects on the deck
of the steamer. A way being at last cleared, a little gentleman with a
white head was conducted off the vessel; and on its being known that
this was the ſameur Lord Maire, a feeling of disappointment seemed to
pervade the French; and the old saying,
“Parturiunt Montes, nascitur ridiculus Musſgrove]."
was almost literally realised. Notwithstanding the disappointment of
their expectations—for the French were evidently prepared to receive
a live Gog at the least—the LoRD MAYoF was welcomed with several
warm shakes of the hand, and a speech in French; the purport of which
was explained to him, to signify that there was something to eat at the
Railway terminus. U pon this, his Lordship at once made for a fly that
had been in waiting for him, and six having got inside, with three on
the box, the vehicle proceeded at a severe pace—severe, considering
the load—towards Capecure.
. It was a subject of much surprise among the French that the English
did not receive their LoRD MAyor with more enthusiasm; but, although
his Lordship did what he could to distinguish himself, by taking off his
hat and bowing, it was found impossible to get up a hearty i. for
one of a party of nine in a hackney carriage.
HEY-SING was in attendance, as usual, to represent the Temple Bar
Junk; but we saw no prospectuses of that interesting exhibition delivered,
and it is possible, that the Mandarin, like some of the other illustrious
visitors, got separated from his luggage.
DIAMond cut DIAMond.—It is a curious fact, in connexion with
the Great Koh-i-noor, that, in spite of the penalty incurred by the
jeweller charged with the cutting of the precious stone, everybody,
almost, on seeing it at the Exhibition, has been disposed to cut it also.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAR1.

THE GREEN ONES.
THE Wegetarians have dined with a moral end. As Zeal-in-the-land-
Busy ate roast pork publicly in Bartholomew Fair, to demonstrate unto
all men his abhorrence of Judaism, so have Mr. BROTHERTON and
friends shown their disgust of sarcophagi, by eschewing flesh, and con-
suming vegetables only; carrots being the roots of all goodness... We
cannot but feel great reverence for these public exhibitions of virtue.
If a man set up within himself any particular rushlight morality, the
taper burns with additional lustre, if burning before the mid-day
luminary. Why should excellence be its own dark-lanthorn? We yet
hope to see the time when all and every of the domestic virtues shall
have their public gatherings; and the Faithful Husband Club, and the
Affectionate Father Lodge, shall have their mid-day processions in
common with the Brass-workers and the Glass-blowers; nay, we shall be
only the more delighted, if, like those material artificers, they–the
moral doers—shall be able to carry before them some type and evidence
of their domestic worth and industry. º
Now, taking it for granted that a man's household virtues—like a
man's clothes—are kept from the moth, by being occasionally turned
inside out to the sum, we object to the principle of the Wegetarians as
altogether short-coming of their avowed end. They d. the act
cruel and barbarous that turns sheep into mutton: they will eat of
nothing that has partaken of animal life. Why stop here Vege-
table existence exempt from pain?, Can MR. BROTHERTON lay hi
hand upon his heart or head, and declare his conscientious conviction
that there is no blood in a turnip?—That a parsnip has no dilacerating
.* when torn from the bosom of its º: earth? What says the
poet :
“For 'tis my faith that ev'ry flow'r
Enjoys the air it breathes.”
Have ‘. no hearts : Are not heads of broccoli a household
figure of speech? If MR. BROTHERTON gives up his mutton—if he
will no longer have a leg to stand upon—we cannot see how, as a man
of sensibility, he can honestly sit down to turnips: he cannot renounce
every morseſ of gammon, without foregoing every blade of spinach.
Moreover, can MR. BROTHERTON §§ eat of any vegetable marrow,
without a thought of the animal blood transmuted into its green flesh?
Why, the Vegetarian may consume garbage at second hand. . The very
riests of the Temple turned a penny upon, animal refuse; for, says a
abbi, “the blood poured at the foot of the altar flowed into a pipe,
and emptied itself into the valley, of Kedron; and it was sold to the
fl. to dung their gardens.” Now the blood of sheep, and now
the pulp of gourds.
Again, has MR. BROTHERTON ever fairly balanced his mind upon a
cocoa-nut? Certain Indian sects have a poetical belief, that of the
refuse of the red earth of which ADAM was made, was made the cocoa-
tree: a touching truth, marked and preserved in the cocoa-nut itself:
in its fibrous hair; in its marks of eyes and mouth. . We have a lively
faith that it is only necessary to awaken the sympathies of MR. BROTH-
ERTON towards the claims of cocoa-nuts in general, to make him fear:
fully eschew them, as most sinful food; as little other than the fare of
cannibals. Indeed, we believe that the same philosophy that renounces
animal food because of the pain inflicted upon animal sensation, has
only to follow its inductions, when it must give up the beans along
with the bacon. It may be that the Vegetarian hugs himself in the
belief of the innocence of his diet, because cauliflowers do not, like
capons, cry under the knife. But, it may be asked, do fish cry upon
the hook? Still, we do not believe that the Wegetarian would eat even
carrots if, upon leaving the earth, carrots screamed like mandrakes.
As the Vegetarians spread their table-cloth in public, and osten-
tatiously display their capers (without the mutton) to the world, we
infringe upon no private right of stomach, by criticising the vegetable
fare. We merely contend that the Wegetarians do not go far enough :
they have not proved the want of sensation in the things they gather
for their plates. Hence, why should they not improve upon their
benevolent intentions, and, wholly eschewing ſº meat, try pebbles P
In the last century, there was a man who distinguished himself by
boarding upon stones; a man, whose portrait has descended to us, as
The Stone Eater. Let the Vegetarians begin modestly with gravel;
and their next amended meal will, we doubt not, have, if possible, a
greater moral influence, and effect a more lasting social good, than their
ate banquet on meal and lentils., Indeed, we yet hope to see the day,
when certain philosophers—for the benefit of the human race—will
entirely subsist upon air. Nay, it is our belief that, in the next century,
children, set apart to become the sages and teachers of the world, will
be reared upon mere wind: yes, taken from the month, and brought up
by hand-bellows.
REAsos why THE “Good TIME” is so Long “CoMINg.”—It started
very foolishly, by an Express Train on the South-Western; so it would
be premature to expect it for a long time yet!
POPERY COURTING PERSECUTION.
To the Editor of the “Tallet.”
oNour ABLE SIR.—MIGHT I
ask you to consider, whether,
as a literary advocate of the
Popish cause, you do not
show rather more zeal than
discretion? A recent number
of your paper contained a
statement of the objects and
intentions of a confederacy
calling itself the “Catholic
Defence Association.” There
must be some mistake, lºyal
Sir, in this title, I think. The
*Čatholic offence Associa.
tion,” surely, is the proper
designation of this worthy
confraternity, organised as it
apparently is, to annoy and
exasperate to the utmost the
eople of this country, and to
rustrate the laws of the
realm. I need not ask your
pardon for identifying you
with a body of which you are
ostensibly the mouth-piece.
You, then, I address you
as the representative of
the Catholic Offenders —
have thought fit to proclaim
and publish to the world that
you are about to engage in a
determined struggle for the subjugation of the British nation to the
power of Rome.
Don't you think, my loyal Sir, that you had much better have kept
your designs to yourself?. First, you announce, with a bravado which
cannot, but consider, injudicious, that you must have the Ecclesias-
tical Titles Bill repealed; next, the penal laws against the Jesuits
abolished; and, lastly, the acts for securing the Protestantism of the
Regency, and of the Šuccession itself, done away with. You candidly
tell us, in fact, that, to use a sporting phrase, you mean to “go in” for
Papal Supremacy. -
Now, loyal Sir, is it really your intention to procure, if possible, the
repeal of the Catholic Emancipation Bill? Are you indeed desirous
that the people at large should rise, and demand the suppression of
all your monasteries, and the expulsion of your whole hierarchy from
the country? Is it a fact that you are labouring to occasion a renewal
of the London riots? Because, practically, these are most certainly
the results which }. fine writing is calculated to produce. * -
Are you, on behalf of your co-religionists, making love to persecu-
tion and martyrdom? Or can it be that you are the tool of some
enthusiastic but unscrupulous Protestants, and in that, character are
oing your very, best to render the Roman Catholic religion and its
professors as odious as possible? A * who, at the instigation
of your church, was roasted alive, said, at the stake, that he should,
that day, light such a candle in England as should never be put out.
It strikes me that you are trying hard to kindle as lasting a con-
flagration. - -
Only let me advise you to mind what you say about meddling with
the succession. This is dangerous ground: another step or two,
and you will put your foot in it—perhaps not your foot only. Be
warned in time, loyal Sir, by your occasional reader,
39ū9C#.
A Vulgar Error.
ON the appearance of the Lord MAyor in the streets of Paris, the
populace is stated by the papers to have shouted, “Pive le Grand
Mºire de Londresſ" Was not this a mistake? Should it not have been,
“Wire la Grand-mere de Londres f"
ONE OF THE TRIALs of GENTILITY.-Being had up at the Old
Bailey for throwing eggs.
Putting their Choler up.
It is said that ALDERMAN HUMPHREY, having lost his luggage, was
obliged to borrow a shirt in Paris. We are surprised at this, when it
is generally understood that the LoRD MAYOR gave a-front to all his
brother Aldermen.

MR. PUNCH2S REVIEW OF THE SESSION.
Now, August arriving, by dint of contriving, There was much talk of movement towards legal improvement,
| The Bills are showed on with unwonted progression; Of quick'ning the Chancery rate of progression,
| Till in part by hard working, and partly by burking, And Barristers leading, on Practice and §§.
The Commons have managed to wind up the Session. In Commission have sat for the whole of the Session;
A short retrospection may lead to reflection But this incubation, of lengthen'd duration,
On the sum of performance, compared with profession: View'd with so much alarm by the Learned Profession,
So as popular leaders, we call on our readers Has F. nought as yet, Sir-and the good we may get, Sir,
To follow us through a slight sketch of the Session. Whatever it be, can't be scored to the Session.
We’d best make the most of our one Bill to boast of, When promised a Jew Bill, we thought 'twas a true bill,
That slap on the face given to Papal Aggression; And hoped to see Rothschild in quiet possession
And that once recorded, and praise for’t awarded, Of his seat in the House, Sir, but the hope was a chouse, Sir,
One scarce knows what else we have got from the Session. For, thanks to the Lords, that’s put off for the Session!
The old Income-Tax, Sir, is still on our backs, Sir, So, instead of one Jew, Sir, we now have got two, Sir,
(And it’s not SIR CHARLEs Wood's fault we haven’t a fresh.”un); To make a still louder appeal 'º. oppression;
And for Window-Tax gone, Sir, there’s House-Tax laid on, Sir ; And City votes hustle poor dear LoRn John Russell,
And that’s the financial great coup of the Session. To take up once again his dropped Bill of the Session."
If Smithfield’s demolish'd, our sewers are n’t abolish'd; On the whole, looking back, Sir, one feels there’s a lack, Sir,
We’ve the Water Monopolists still in possession, (I think one may say so without indiscretion,)
And must still take Thames sewage for drink and for brewage; Of much to be proud of, or boast very loud of,
And the question of Water’s hung up for the Session. In all that's been done through the whole of the Session.
The dead are still hurried through the streets to be buried But there's one consolation for Punch and the Nation,
In graveyards pack'd tight at a Sexton's discretion, If one turns from performance away to profession,
And the Board of liealth can't act, when told that it shan’t act: The less that’s done now, Sir, the more, you’ll allow, Sir, -
And such are the sanit'ry gains of the Session. Is left for that wonderful period—next Session. -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SLANDERED KING BOMBA.
R. PUNCH, Does the
KING OF NAPLEs
wish to confound
his slanderers, by
rewarding—at the
shortest notice—a
disinterested advo-
cate P Here he is :
one CHARLEs MAC-
FARLANE, a person
singularly fitted to
shine at the Court
of Naples—shine,
like a last week’s
mackarel. MR.
MACPARLANE is
not unknown to
the worldof letters,
as an industrious
workman. He now
comes forward to
of KING Fer DI-
NAND, as his ad-
mirer. “The
Devil is worship-
ped for his burning
throne.” The ad-
miration of MR.
MACFARLANE is,
doubtless, extorted from him by the matural nobility of the Neapolitan
King: he loves him for what he is: and it is for the rebuked and
instructed world to pay homage to the idol and the idolator. MUMBo-
JUMBo and his º: priest are worthy of each other.
MR. GLApstone, in his letter to Lord ABERDEEN, speaks of torture
inflicted for political offences. “The mode of it being the thrusting of
sharp instruments under the finger-nails.”
MR. MACFARLANE, in his letter, thus disposes of the charge:– “The
insinuation that torture has been employed, is too monstrous and too
absurd to merit one moment's attention.” And, no doubt, MR. MAC-
FARLANE disbelieves it; just as MR. MACFARLANE would refuse credence
to “a sharp instrument” under, his own “finger-nails,” if thrust there
by the order of the KING of NAPLEs. The “insinuation”—though a
sharp one—would not “merit one uoment's attention.” One would
almost wish that MR. MACFARLANE could give warranty of such
disbelief.
MR. GLADSTONE–says MACFARLANE-in his tales about gaol doctors
and sick prisoners, talks “a perfect fable.” The miseries of Italy are
not the work of benevolent potentates like FERDINAND, but are attri-
butable—thus speaks the awful MACFARLANE, whose reputation shines
like the Koh-i-moor to all who know him—“to vagabondslike MAzzINI.”
When a MACFARLANE would lick away the blood and mire that incrust
a King of Naples, he must, of course, spit “vagabond" at men like
MAzzini. Some way, he must empty his mouth.
But MR. GLADstone has a reason—a selfish, worldly reason—for
the slander he has dealt upon KING BoMBA.
&
“MR. GLADston E is apprehensive of being unseated by his Alma Mater, and is
looking for a popular constituency, who would be captivated by his strange letters.”
This is an admirable touch; but only what we should look for from
the genus MACFARLANE. There is no creature so low, so helpless, who
cannot, make dirty motives for other people. MR. GLADSTONE speaks
from the fulness of a noble nature, outraged by a contemplation of
human tyranny and human suffering; and—MR. GLADstone does not
want a remedy for atrocity; no, he wants a popular constituency.
What other motive could be imagined by a motive-mongering Mac-
FARLANE * Yet hear him:—
“Again, other good men tell me that the RIGHT Hon. W. E. GLAnstone, M.P.-first
known to me as a Conservative—has suddenly conceived a strong dislike of all
monarchical institutions, and that he is now in the habit of saying, and repeating, ad
nauseam, that all the monarchies of old Europe are worn out and effete; that monarchy
itself is rococo, and that the sooner we approach to the model normal condition of
the United States of North America, the better it will fare with us all."
Hence, conservatism, in the gentle eyes of CHARLES MACFARLANE
is admiration of the KING OF NAPLEs and his ghastly doings. To
condemn FERDINAND is to applaud revolution; to sympathise with the
victims of a crowned monster, is to wish the downfall of the British
monarchy. The crown of Queen WICTORIA, and the fetters of the
late Prime Minister Porked, are—at least in the hot and twisted
brain of MR. MacFARLANE—strangely, yet indivisibly, connected.
However, we, hope that MacFARLANE will have some measure of
reward that will snatch him far away from England. Naples is his
atmosphere. We are not worthy of him. Can the KING OF NAPLEs
offer no retreat? No comfortable box, a little below the cinders, on
Vesuvius P. Or, probably FERDINAND has a royal menagerie; if so,
does not his ape need a groom or chamberlain? Q.
THE CHINESE IN LONDON.
LoNDON is beginning to be regularly overrun with Chinese, either
genuine or otherwise. If things go on at this rate, every large grocery
|establishment will have its own “Native of the Flowery Laid,” and
JoHN BULL will begin to fancy himself, on account of the numerous
emblems of China around him, a regular “Bull in a China shop.” The
Chinese Exhibition afforded the first instance of a native being converted
“catch the eye”
into an article of commerce, when a couple of flowery youths, said to
have been brought to England to finish their education, used to amuse
the visitors by jumping over the tables, and performing other feats,
evincing less of mental cultivation than of muscular activity. Feeling
a sort of parental interest in these youths—announced as the sons of a
Chinese noble, who had sent them to receive the last ILuropean polish
—we have watched them rather narrowly. We regret to say that we
think we discovered one about three months ago behind the counter of
a tea-dealer’s in the New Cut, where he was employed to give a genuine
appearance to the grocery. Of course it would be difficult to suspect
that the “Fine Old Twankay at Two and Four” being weighed out
by a veritable Chinaman was nothing better than rare old sloe, or that
the “Hyson recommended for Family Use" was nothing but Birch,
W. certainly is adapted occasionally for family use—though not as a
everage.
To come to the point, we do not believe that half the Chinamen we
see about town are more genuine than the Congou and other deleterious
compounds said to have come from China. We think there ought to
be some authority given to detect a counterfeit Chinaman, in the same
way as a counterfeit sixpence, by snipping off his ſail, or trying the
effect of soap and water upon his countenance. We cannot suppose
that so many mandarins can be spared from their official duties in
China, to speculate in Exhibitions of Junks, or other specimens of their
national industry. Fancy Lord JoHN Russell going out to China
with a coal barge, and remaining away three or four years at a stretch
to exhibit it. Imagine his Lordship getting up a ball on board, in one
of the Chinese rivers, as our Essex Street Mandarin does on board
the Junk; or fancy his Lordship, or any other nobleman, taking out a
quantity of upholstery, with his wife and children, and sitting in the
midst of it all, week after week, as an “Exhibition” at Hong Kong, like
the “family of rank” that are honouring us with a long visit—in return
for our shillings—at Hyde Park Corner. It is rarely that any members
of our aristocracy condescend to make shows of themselves, in the wa
we are called upon to believe that the mandarins and persons of ran
in China are accustomed to do when upon their travels. The worst
we can say of any of our lords is, that one of them, occasionally, will
take pills by the hundred, and rub in ointment by the ton, to oblige an
advertising “professor;” but even this, to the credit of our own
peerage, is a solitary instance.
THE TEA AND SHRIMP NUISANCE.
WE beg leave to call the attention of the Knightsbridge authorities
—whoever "..."; be—to the unpleasant fact, that it is impossible
to pass along the Knightsbridge road after ten o'clock in the mornin
without being invited, and almost dragged by the collar, to a me
of “tea and shrimps.” The road near the Exhibition presents all the
horrors of Greenwich at about tea-time, and the struggle round a
perplexed foreigner, whom it is desired to cram with a regular Gravesend
jorum of all sorts of coarse and cheap eatables and drinkables, is
sometimes most intense. To say nothing of the nuisance of being
estered to take tea at all hours, we want to know where is the affinity
[. the Exhibition and shrimps. We can understand shrimps at
a watering-place, but there can be nothing particularly fresh in the
shrimps of Knightsbridge, even supposing them to be caught as near at
hand as Chelsea, which is famous for nothing in the fish line, except
oyster-shells, which may be sometimes found scattered on parts of
the coast. Jn several occasions we have been nearly carried off into
some way-side house, after leaving the Exhibition, and been thrust down
opposite a large pile of that fishy abomination, which, next to the
periwinkle, we hold in the supremest contempt.
If we do not make a firm stand against the Shrimp, we shall be
having the Whelk thrust upon our disgusted attention, in connection
with Tea, a beverage we would fain protect against the unpleasant
contact. At all events, if there is a growing appetite on the part of
the public for the inland Shrimp, let those who have no taste for it
be at least secured from the annoyance of being beset by a swarm of
touters, who line the road between the Crystal Palace and Sloane
Street, dinning into the ear of the passenger the disagreeable cry of
“Tea and Shrimps.”

CITY PRIVATE THEATRICALS.
§
The following scene has, we understand, been performed in private, with no very great
success, at the Mansion House, since the return of the citizens from the Paris Fºes. The
LoRD Maxon appears to have given very great dissatisfaction by the manner in which he acted
his part, and by his unfair mode of endeavouring to keep in the back-ground those who ought
to have been prominent—as his brother actors—in the recent Parisian performances. The
Private Theatricals at the Mansion House have been limited to
THE CELEBRATED QUARREL SCENE FROM JULIUS CAESAR.

“‘To the Bishops and Clergy of the Roman Catholic Church, in
England: Benediction. I have a twofold object, brethren, in addressing
you. In the first place, I wish you, if possible, to disabuse the public
mind in Great Britain of the notion (I am afraid maliciously propagated)
that I am the author of certain absurd documents called Bulls and
Briefs, published in my name, replete not only with the most ridiculous
arrogance, but also with inflated phraseºlogy and pompous rhetoric.
In the next place, I wish you to contrºl the unjustifiable assertion,
that I will not suffer the Protesta!, to have a place of worship
within the walls of Rome, and have restricted them to the use of an
extramural granary. I desire that you will have the goodness to
notify the fact, that Protestants are welcome to erect a Church at
Rome in as fine a position and as central a situation as, claiming for
ourselves that toleration which we extend to others, I have recom-
mended you to build a Roman Catholic Cathedral in, by public
subscription, in London. We have our own opinions, of course; but
I wish you to convince the English people that we, nevertheless, most
religiously observe the principle of doing as we would be done by.
I shall be glad if you will explain that the only reason why the
Protestants have hitherto been confined to a granary out of Rome is
because they have not yet raised the funds necessary for erecting a
church in the city.”
“The usual signatures follow. This is the language of your bigoted,
intolerant, bombastic Pope. But—alas for British prejudice —I fear
the document will never be credited to be genuine, though vouched
for by your scrupulously particular correspondent, “W
‘WERAx.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
91
A NIGHT WITH HAHNEMANN AT THE FREE-
MASONS’ TAWERN.
“MR. PUNCH,-Health, Sir, health, as some sage observes, is the first
of earthly blessings. The next, as I say, is the means of recovering it
when lost. I have taken, Sir, large quantities of MoRRISON's Pills. I
have also had extensive recourse to those of PROFEssor HollowAY,
at the same time making copious use of the Ointment of that philosopher.
Some years ago, I underwent a course of brandy and salt, and since
then subjected myself to the water-cure. I should have told you, Sir,
that I am a valetudinarian, and rather considerably past that age when
a man is said to be either a fool or a physician—for my part, I am a
homoeopathist. I have studied the subject, Sir, in my own person.
For years I suffered greatly from severe nervous depression; for
which I was in the constant habit of taking medicine without effect
except that I got worse and worse. Nothing relieved me till I resorted
to the infinitesimal globules—leaving off my mixture three times a-day,
my sleeping powder, and my two pills night and morning. The result
is my É. conviction. that Homoeopathy is the only true system of
medicine. And now, Sir, as a friend of science, let me direct your atten-
tion to the Times report of the late meeting of the English Homoeopathic
Association, at Freemasons' Tavern. There, Sir, you will see that our
views are supported by sound and solid arguments. I look upon the
speech of Sir John KENNAway, the Chairman, as a masterpiece of
homoeopathic reasoning. Expressing exactly my own sentiments, SIR
John said,
“‘He was not a professional man; but he only asserted the claim which was granted
to all in their individual position—that of judging for himself.'
“This is just what I once told my medical attendant when I was laid
}. with the gout, and we had a dispute on the subject of º:
e said that the right to judge for one’s self did not always imply
#: ability. I did not understand this insolence, Sir, and I discharged
In.
“The worthy Chairman also observed, with remarkable wisdom,
that
“‘They could not enter into an investigation of the principles of the science—of its
application—of its successes—satisfactorily; yet they could tell, by the effects of it on
themselves, which of the two systems was the better.”
A man has been physicked, bled, and blistered, and
gets no better. He leaves off his medicine, takes infinitesimal doses,
and recovers. Why take the trouble to inquire whether his first
treatment was a fair sample of the regular system, or what influence it
had on his recovery, or how far that happy event was due to the simple
discontinuance of pills and potions? R. creep to conclusions in
this way. Jump at them, Sir ; jump with seven-leagued boots. The
patient took globules and got better; is not that enough P. It is all
very well for medical men to cavil and question whether the recovery
was post hoc or propter hoc, as they say; making a mystery of a plain
fact with their technicalities and their Latin. , No, Sir. Give me such
logic as SIR John KENNAway's, or the logic of MR. SHAEN, M.A.,
another of the enlightened speakers, who
“‘Said he was a living proof of the benefits of Homoeopathy. Eight or nine years
ago he was constantly in the doctors' hands; but since he adopted this system he very
seldom had to visit them; and when he did so, it was with satisfactory results, both to
his pocket and his health.'
“This is the way to argue, Sir. Here you have no quibbling as to
the effect of change of diet, habits, or other trivial and unimportant
circumstances. The globules were swallowed: the health was improved.
“To be sure.
Cause and effect, Sir. - -
“I coruially coincide also with the sentiments of MR. W. HASHURST,
who declared that

“No exaggeration this, Sir, of ordinary practice.

“Refined phraseology, Sir, rather.

sequence was, he stood before them, rescued from death, and in good health.' . . .
“There, Sir,’s a sequitur for you!

“Homoeopathic truth, Sir. The maxim, you know, has been laid down
by the College of Physicians. It : with SYDENHAM or HARVEY,
I believe; but I forget which.

the other members of the English Homoeopathic Association call them,
“Doctors.' ... Here, Sir, in conclusion, I must say a word to express
my admiration of the 'taste which so remarkab y distinguished this
assembly in general, but was more particularly and conspicuously
manifested by DR. EPPs, who, says the report,...' bore, down” ch the

A Noble Lord, who has been declared by an enlightened constituency a
fit and proper person to represent the county of Middlesex, coming
forward publicly as the patron of Homoeopathy, would do much to
remove an impression, unfortunately prevalent, that anybody who can
believe in infinitesimal doses must be a simpleton.

EXTRAORDINARY WISION AT THE MANSION HOUSE,
MYSTERIOUs disappearance of
the witnesses in the St. Alban’s
Bribery Case, a few months
ago, is only to be equalled in
strangeness by their very mys-
terious appearance, the other
day, at the Mansion House.
These witnesses are, in fact, so
many Ombres Chinoises, or dis-
solving views, of whom we lose
sight, until the QUEEN goes
down to the House with the
* view of dissolving or proroguing
Parliament. They are like clown
and pantaloon, who are to be
seen, as bold as brass, before the
door of the house, when the door
is closed; but who, when the
- door opens, and the Serjeant-
at-Arms issues forth, mace in hand are nowhere visible.
It is but a little while since that the Commons, indignant at the
breaches committed against, their privileges, were offering rewards for
individuals, who, with the bills still posted about for their apprehension,
are walked quietly into custody, and as quietly walk out again. Nobody
will have anything to do with them; though probably, next Session,
there will be the same indignation in the House, the same threats of
vengeance, the same horror at the breach of privilege, and perhaps the
same, or much higher, rewards offered to get hold of them. An active
officer, thinking he has secured a prize, goes with a couple of the much-
sought-after parties, and instead of finding them eagerſy clutched at on
all sides, and paid for in “gash down,” he has them left upon his hands,
as “stale, flat, and unprofitable” as a couple of buns baked the day
before yesterday. He goes to the House of Commons, and finds it shut
up; though there is an inspector outside, who won’t have the prize
prisoners at any price. The Serjeant-at-Arms is out; there is nobody
who will É. a dump for the captives, at the Treasury; the Solicitor,
when applied to, knows nothing at all about it; and, as a last resort, an
attempt is made to see whether the witnesses, lately so valuable, will
fetch a trifle at the Mansion House.
All is in vain; the witnesses have gone down as rapidly as railway
scrip after the bursting of the bubble; and though they would have
been worth fifty pounds apiece a fortnight ago, nobody will now make
the smallest bidding for them. They would have been quite a curiosity,
commanding, a high price at any moment during the Session; but
now, like a luxury out of the proper season—like oysters in May,
sprats in June, or hares in March—no one seems to consider them worth
house-room. In February next they will no doubt be once more, in
brisk demand, when they will grow as scarce as they had been during
the past Session.

STRANGE INSECT IN THE CROPS,
ALL accounts from the country continue to assure us that the wheat
is visited by, what the English farmer insists upon considering, the most
fatal blight. A curious kind of insect is to be seen in every ripe ear of
corn; and the riper and larger the corn, the larger the insect. Several of
these have been forwarded to Mr. Punch, who—the real farmer's friend
—has submitted the insect to his microscope of peculiar power. It is
tolerably well known that various things of insect life are significantly
marked. There is the death's head moth—the monk caterpillar. Now,
the insect at the present time infesting the wheat-crops of 1851—an
insect almost invisible to the naked eye—shows, when submitted to a
glass of 1000 power, a white space on its back, the white marked thus
—“5d.” By which Punch divines that the blight at present found
.#; British Farmers' wheat predicts—“The Best tern Loaf,
price 5d.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
They’ll talk big enough about it all, no
“A HIGH SHERIFE IN DIFFICULTY.”
THE High Sheriff of Suffolk has been an object of sympathy. At
one time there seemed no help for it, but that he must perform his
legal function of executioner; no deputy being obtainable. MARY
CAGE, for poisoning her husband, was to have been hanged on Saturday,
at Ipswich : but ČArcraft, the hangman, had to do his office on the
same morning at Norwich. The Warwick hangman was also pre-
engaged. Great was the dismay of the High Sheriff of Suffolk!
“To have had the law carried into effect on Saturday [says the newspaper para-
graph] would, beyond all probability, have been repugnant to the feelings of the High
Sheriff; for, as no person could be found to supply the place of Calca AFT, the High
Sheriff must have performed the horrid duty himself.”
And why not If the punishment be a wholesome punishment
—if the sacredness of life is to be taught by the taking away of human
existence—who can be too exalted to teach to the nations the awful
lesson? Wherefore “horrid duty?” Why not—solemn sacrifice P
“The unpleasant position of the High Sheriff, not only on this, but on a former occa-
sion, may be attributed to the usual course not being adopted —the making sure that
CALCRAFT can attend before any day be appointed for the execution.”
We altogether dissent from the principle that makes the office of an
executioner a “horrid duty,” and a reproach. If–as the advocates of
the infliction of death avow—the taking away of life be the fulfilment of
a solemn behest, solemnly, pronounced, then why should the High
Sheriff, or indeed any much higher functionary, be considered too nice,
too dainty, to carry out the injunction? But, no; human instinct is
greater than human sophistry. Our very loathing of the function of
executioner is the irrepressible condemnation of his office.

TOTAL ABSTINENCE AND MODERATION.
AN average meeting of Teetotallers was held jº. evening in
Spouters' Hall, to enjoy a little excitement derived from hearing every-
body abused, instead of from the abuse of fermented liquors. Some
Welsh choristers attended, and sang, at intervals, some of their national
choruses, occasioning among the more irritable of the assembly
paroxysms of enthusiasm approaching to frenzy.
MR. BELLOWAY took the chair, supported by the principal pro-
pagandists of the Pump, who would employ the handle of that useful
engine as a lever, with which to hoist clean off the world its whole load
of vice, misery, and disease; and who advertise the water-cure as a
panacea for all conceivable evil, from infidelity to measles.
| The CHAIRMAN congratulated the meeting on the immense success
which was attending the mighty Temperance movement, and which
would soon produce a magnificent deficit in a rascally revenue, swelled
by the atrocious Excise duties imposed and perpetuated by an unprin-
cipled Government that encouraged the consumption of ardent spirits.
He concluded an i. invective against HER MAJESTY's
Ministers, amid loud cheers, by calling on his hearers to make a solemn
resolution not to vote for anybody as Member of Parliament who,
amongst other pledges, would not take the pledge of total abstinence.
elsh song was then sung, and twice encored. A demand for its
third repetition occasioned a tremendous uproar that lasted several
minutes; after which,
MR. Scream ER said, the House of Commons was as bad as the
Government, and the House of Lords as bad as the House of Commons,
or worse. An election never took place without more or less of that
soul-destroying fluid, beer, being drunk; to say nothing of those yet
more abominable liquids, gin, rum, brandy, and whisky, with which the
vile and treacherous candidates paralysed the intellect and corrupted
the morals of a debased and slavish constituency. A young lordling—
a whelp of the aristocracy—could not come of age, but his brutal
parents, in honour of the occasion, must needs broach barrels of strong
ale, generally brewed at the young man's birth, and kept for twenty-
one long years, on purpose to acquire the more powerfully intoxicating
H.". and thus to make the tenants—he would rather say the
elots—of the inhuman oligarch more disgracefully drunk. What an
example, too, these minions of rank set those pampered menials whose
from their distant tone with Lord MAYok Musgrove, it was clear

business it was to wait behind their chairs at dinner, and keep
replenishing their glasses and those of their pot companions with per-
nicious champagne | The drunkenness of the lower orders was mainly
owing to the pattern afforded them by a boozing peerage and a gentry
of sots (Cheers).
MR. EARsplit said, that alcohol was the principle of evil. It was
against that, in particular, that the idle, lazy, worthless set of sensual
sinecurists, the clergy, had to contend. What had those clerical drones
done? The reverend impostors had done nothing. There ought to be
no Temperance societies. The parsons—those hireling shepherds—
were bound to have done the work. What was the use of those
hypocrites in canonicals preaching against drunkenness? That was
mere cant. Why didn't they join the Teetotallers? (Cheers), Why,
because the wolves in sheep's clothing couldn't give up their glass
of “old crusted ” after dinner. Let nobody talk to him of moderation.
It was much better to get dead drunk every now and them, than take
one glass of wine every day. At public dinners the Church was drunk,
and a bishop would of en respond to the toast. If the mitred swindler
did his duty, he would improve the occasion, by denouncing the deadly,
the diabolical, the execrable custom of drinking healths altogether.
(Tremendous cheering)
MR. STUNNER inveighed furiously against the medical profession for
withholding their sanction from the principle of total abstinence, which
he imputed to a selfish interest, on their part, in disease and suffering.
He understood that these licensed quacks employed, in their practice,
wines of iron, aloes, and other medicinal substances, besides a variety
of tinctures; which were medicated grog; and he insisted that the
administration of such liquid poison amounted to murder.
The Army, the Navy, and the Bar were fiercely assailed by various
speakers for not discountenancing the use of fermented liquors, by
excluding them from their several messes. A MR. LETHERHED also
ferociously abused the brewers, the distillers, and the publicans, whom
he appeared to confound with the class of persons who, under the
man empire, were so odious among the Jews.
After another Welsh song, followed by a renewed disturbance,
The CHAIRMAN, having proposed a resolution to the effect, that
PRINCE ALBERT should be requested to patronise the Total Abstinence
cause by taking the pledge,
MR. PUNCH said, that though not quite a convert to total abstinence,
he believed that temperance was a necessary virtue. He would not go
so far as to object to everything strong; but there were some strong
things he did object to. He objected to strong language and intemperate
expressions, which, though among the worst effects of drunkenness, he
perceived could be produced without liquor.
This brief remark occasioned a general row, in the midst of which
the meeting separated.
THE SIEGE OF GIBRALTAR AT CREMORNE.
= LL., persons ee that the
Rock of Gibraltar is not very
high. Viewed from Batter-
sea Bridge, it cannot stand
higher than eight feet above
the surface of the Thames.
This is rather curious ; for
we recollect when we saw
the same view at the Surre
Zoological Gardens, the Roc
was at least a hundred feet
high; so that, in less than
four years, Gibraltar has lost
more than nine-tenths of its
altitude. In another year we
suppose it will have disap-
peared altogether.
The Rock is exceedingly
perpendicular; so perpen-
dicular, that none but a cat
could possibly scale it. It
would be a question, however
if any one but a cat would
give himself that trouble, as
A a vigorous push of the elbow
A would pitch the entire Rock
ºf with the greatest ease into
the water. We could not
help thinking, as we witnessed
the Siege, that it was con-
ducted with a tremendous
waste of gunpowder, when any two scene-shifters could have taken
Gibraltar at a moment's notice simply by carrying it off on their
shoulders.'
ition of steam.
The scenery about Gibraltar is exce, dingly flat, reninding us ex-
tremely of one of the “wings” that shut in the Robber's Cave in the
Miller and his Men. We looked out for the monkeys that are said to
run about the topmost heights of the Rock, but not one did our eye–
experienced as it generally is in picking out a monkey—succeed in
catching. We immediately inferred all the monkeys had gone to dance
on the platform.
The thing that surprised us the most in the Siege was the introduc-
We never knew, before we went to Cremorne, that
Gibraltar was taken by the aid of steamers. This fact burst upon us,
the other evening, with all the brilliancy of a sky-rocket; and, as such
we hand º over to MR. MACAULAY, that he may illumine his historical
pages with it.
The names of the steamers engaged in the action were the Bride, the
Bridesmaid, the Groom, the Wedding-Ring, assisted by the Parson, the
Beadle, and the Parish Clerk. There seems to be a strict intimacy
between the Naval and the Matrimonial Services on the Thames; and,
by way of parenthesis, we humbly hope that the engagements of the
. will always terminate as honourably as the engagements of the
other |
There was a reserve squadron of the Citizen Boats lying off in the
offing, with an extra stock of fireworks on board, in case the attendance
at the Gardens had been sufficiently large to have called in their
assistance. It would be invidious to mention names, but we plainly
distinguished the cotton pocket-handkerchief of ADMIRAL JINKs flyin
proudly from the mizen-mast of the Grocers, whilst the brave Admira
himself was standing with the greatest unconcern on the paddle-box,
quietly smoking his pipe, as if nothing at all was going on | We re-
marked to a bystander, “That is exactly like JINKs l’”
The action began about 11 o'clock, P.M., by CoMMODORE JONES
giving the signal to “EASE 'ER.” Immediately his flag-ship, the
Bridesmaid, advanced to the Rock as near as the shallowness of the
water would allow it, and discharged such a broadside of squibs as made
Battersea Bridge shiver again in every one of its timbers. All the
other ships followed, each of them firing, as they passed the Citadel,
with the most admirable precision. The firing was fearful, for, to judge
of great results by little causes, we know we had on a white waistcoat
at the time, and in less than three minutes it was completely black. The
smoke, too, was so intense that we were obliged frequently to close our
eyes to the beauty of the scene. We regret we lost, in this way, a great
deal of the Siege. The consequence was, we heard a great deal more than
we saw. However, if we can trust everything in this world which we
hear, the Bombardment must have been one of the fierceston record, for
we have not heard such a noise since the opera of Florinda. When we
opened our eyes again, a flag was being waved behind the battlements of
Gibraltar—an unanimous discharge of sky-rockets leapt up from the port-
holes of every ship, as if they wanted to set the sky on fire; we heard a
voice (we think it was Jones's) crying “Stop 'ER!”—the Thames turned
from red ink to black,-and we were told that the impregnable Rock
had surrendered. The Siege was over in about ten minutes, and it was
as pretty as fireworks shot right and left, and then left and right, and
then both together, could make it; but we registered a vow on the spot,
that until cannons and Roman candles could be taught, like chimneys,
and PALMER’s “Compositions,” to consume their own smoke, we never
would witness another.
We afterwards strolled about the beautiful Gardens of Cremorne, and
as we listened to the music, that made us jump in a more agreeable
way than the cannon balls, and enjoyed a cigar, whose smoke was much
leasanter in our eyes than the most dazzling fusillade of Catharine
W. we puffed ourselves into a state of high philosophic enjoyment,
and rather startled the company by exclaiming, that “We would not

“WHICH IS THE BEST WAY OF TESTING A BLADEP”
WE find in our friend, Notes and Queries, an article with the above
title. They recommend various plans—such as pressing him with all
your strength upon an iron block, and knocking him against the fire-
grate as hard as you can ; and doubling him up by bringing a weight of
400 lbs. to bear upon his side, and a multitude of other agreeable tests,
which we should be very sorry to apply to any “Blade” of our
acquaintance. There are various ways of testing a Blade. You can
ask him to stand security at a Loan Office. If he shrinks, he is not a
ood Blade. The best way, however, is to try him with a good Bill.
f; the Bill is a very heavy one, and you find that, without much pressing,
the Blade gives way quietly, and allows you to make a handle of him
by putting his name to the Bill, and moreover, takes up the Bill when
it becomes due, you may consider it a very fair test indeed, and that
your Blade must be a first-rate one for not turning rusty, or snapping,
during the experiment. The softer your Blade, the better, of course,
he yields to the test. In fact, if your Blade is excessively soft, you
may bend him to anything you please, and it becomes difficult to say
whether there is any test so severe that you may not safely venture to
“try it on ” him

WISDOM PREACHING IN THE STREETS.
A FEw years ago it was a frequent spectacle in and about London to
see a concourse of persons collected in some open space, listening to
the exhortations of a preacher in shabby black, with a rubbishheap for
his pulpit, and the sky for his sounding-board. The Police authorities
appear to have suppressed a practice, which probably occasioned ſewer
conversions than cases of pocket-picking. We may, however, anticipate
a revival of sermons sub Jove, if there be truth in the statement of the
correspondent of a morning contemporary, who says,
“As I was passing along Orchard Street, Portman Square, last (Monday) evening,
about nine o'clock, I was surprised to see a great crowd assembled round ‘Kell Meli
Buildings,' and, on inquiry, I found that CARDINAL Wise MAN was preaching from a
platform in the open air. The court, through which there is a thoroughfare into Duke
Street, was illuminated, and filled with Irish. After waiting some little while, the
CARDINAL came into the street, to a carriage, which was waiting for him, attended by
boys and men wearing white surplices, and bearing lighted candles, banners, and also
an immense crucifix. There were a great many, police standing around, but none
attempted to interfere with this illegal procession.”
Of course the license which is conceded to CARDINAL WISEMAN will
not be denied to EBENEZER BROWN. The sincere Jumper has quite as
much a right to promulgate his doctrines in the streets as the zealous
Romanist. It is not because MR. BROWN is a shoemaker, or indeed a
repairer of shoes, that he is to be compelled to “move on,” and the
CARDINAL permitted to proceed. Should either disobey the mandate
to go about his business, the oleaginous collar of EBENEzek is no less
.# no more sacred from the clutch of the º than the what-d'ye-
call-it at the poll of N1cholas; and British Justice contemplates with
equal eye the rusty sables of the former, and the pontificals of the latter
(with all his properties to boot) in the station-house.
Toleration for ever !—but let it be universal toleration. In field
preaching let there be a fair field, and no favour. If the Romish saints
are to have a hearing, let those of the “Latter Day” have the same.
Now that the example has been set by CARDINAL Wise MAN, we may
expect that the REveREND Bo’s’N SMITH will re-enter on his itinerant
mission. The CARDINAL may consider himself to be a commissioned
officer of the Ship of PETER: but the Law of England takes no more
account of him than it does of the Bo’s’N. The wisdom of anybody has
as much right to cry in the streets as the wisdom of WISEMAN.
It's an ill Fire that burns good to Nobody.
AN accident by fire has just deprived France of a quantity of that
imsy rag in which she centres much of her glory. The flags taken in
battle, and hung up at the Invalides, were the other day nearly all re-
duced to tinder. We hope the circumstance may turn to the profit of
our neighbours, who might have a great deal more to be proud of than
their military trophies; and we trust, it will now occur to them that in

"I AM “The Wild Horse of the Pampas’—at least I am the unhappy quadruped that
goes by that name; and any one, to see the way I am pulled and hauled about of an evening,
Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.
would think I was the most vicious, unruly beast that ever was crossed. Now, it really is not so
—I am perfectly quiet, and although, what with 'Busses, and one thing and the other, I have seen
some work, perhaps, I am a very good average animal, and have no objection to amuse a public
(particularly a British Public) by any cleverness I possess. I Jump very well, and, as you may
recollect, I take a very good gate as a finish, in as meat a manner as some hunters, I have seen,
with very good characters. . But, however, what I more particularly write to you for, is this:–
every time I complete a rapid act, and am really more ready for five bars rest than anything else,
| I am seized by a gigantic Frenchman, in trousers, too, (alas! where are the dear old top-boots
I recollect in poor DUCRow's time?) who almost pulls my head off; and I really believe would
actually do so, if my rider did not tug as vi º; in a contrary direction—and this because I
am supposed to be raying mad, and that nothing but the most violent opposition prevents me from
.# out of the circle_and_galloping about the pit. No one, I am sure, can feel for a dumb
animal more than you, Mr. Punch; and I wish you, by a word or two, to abate, if possible,
the terrible pulling and hauling. I have alluded to Mind, I don't object to the galloping and
jumping—I rather like it—and I may say that it is a pleasure to be backed by a fellow with so
much pluck and nerve as MR. EATON STONE.

With grinning teeth and wolfish look;
On high their dingy fists they shook,
Their shirtless bosoms wildly strook;

They roared and bawled with all their force,

The shaft a torch; the limbs were two:
The Cross thus form'd he shook on high,
With felon hand, and evil eye,
And fierce and frenzied feelings woke
In imprecations whilst he spoke:–
“Woe to the spalpeen who shall view
This symbol of our native stew,
And not resolve that he will do
Whate'er he can a storm to brew,
For England’s overthrow !
Nasal and low his voice became
The while he tipp'd the Cross with flame;
And the few words that reach'd the air,
Although some saintly names were there,
Had more of balderdash than prayer.
But when he brandish'd o'er the crowd
Its blazing points, he cried aloud,
“Woe to the thief who turns his rear,
When summoned by this symbol here;
For, as its points these Congreves sear—
I say no more—the faithful near
Full well my meaning know.
Ye understand the hint of flame,
I’ll say no more about that same;
And lads and lasses on his name
Shall spit and trample, and cry shame
Upon our Pontiff's foe l’”
Then rang the tongues of females, till .
It seemed the clacking of a mill,
Everyone scolding with a will ;
And children, you’d have thought them ill,
Did squeak and squall also;
Answering, what to repeat we dread,
And likewise “Punch the sinner's head;
A couch of nettles be his bed,”
And “sorrow take him, too,” they said;
“Bad luck to him, and woe!”
A sharp and noisy echo gave
The Pope's Brass Band of fool and knave,
Who for a while have ceased to rave
*Mid outcries of “Oh, oh!”
Then paused the holy man anew,
And º hard he puff’d and blew,
While, with swoln cheeks and shaky hand,
And trembling so he scarce could stand,
And eyes that started from his head,
Worse than he had already said
He strove to say, against the blade
Sedition's call who disobeyed;
And thus again his voice was heard,
In language perfectly absurd:–
“Now bear this Cross, boys, in your van,
And pass it on from man to man.
Blind be the ear that fails to heed'
Deaf be the foot that shuns to speed
Confusion seize the speechless eyes!
Scorn make the heartless soul its prize 1
Drive the black traitor through the earth!
Scout the pale coward from each hearth;
And be a dwelling him denied,
Driven in exile to reside.
As dies in gloom this brilliant spºk,
So live his name in odium dark ſ”
He ceased; and all his hearers then
With one accord exclaim’d “Amen!”
Jeremiah, You needn't blow the Fire.
AMONG the recent inventions, is a venti-
lating stove, intended, we suppose, to enable
a fire to blow itself. ...This may be a con-
venient arrangement, though it lays, the in-
ventor open to the imputation of blowing
hot and cold at the same time. We presume
the ventilation is by a downward draft; for
it would be awkward to have a stove that
would blow up. Perhaps, after all, the object
is to save the expense of advertisements, by
enabling the ventilating stove to puff itself...;

96 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
BLACK LETTERS ON A TABLET ||
To Mr. Punch.
UNCH, in the itinerant
drama, proves, my dear
Sir, more than a match
for the Prince of Dark-
ness; yet—with pain. I
observe it—the Foul
Fiend occasionally de-
ceives even yourself.
There is a Catholic
newspaper, called the
Tablet, and published
at Dublin, conducted
in a spirit of singular
meekness, charity, and
loyalty. It is, indeed,
our leading newspaper; and its co-
lumns, accordingly, are pervaded b
those sentiments of moderation, -
ness, brotherly love, and respect for
Law and Government, by which our
Church is contradistinguished from all
other denominations of Christians—
if any other persons can be called
Christians but ourselves.
“Now, my very dear Sir, you, oc-
casionally quote, as from this religious
Catholic organ, language and expres-
sions the most atrocious and abomi-
nable; and, as parties are commonly
judged of by the tone of their journals,
these quotations are calculated to throw extreme odium on our
sacred cause.
“I know that your extracts from the Tablet are true for . I am
quite aware that you copy fairly the appearances of type; but I must
inform you that these appearances are merely diabolical illusions; such
as in older and better times were quite familiar, and among the Scotch
were designated by the term “glamour.” They can now, as the same
|
º
sort of phantasms could then, be dissipated in an instant by being
sprinkled with holy water: you may try this experiment any º but,
in order that it may succeed, it is, necessary that you shou d first
believe in holy water. A paragraph in the Tableſ—seemingly the
expression of the most currish rancour, the most frantic hatred, the
most venomous malice—by the slightest spargeſaction with the con-
secrated protoxide of '...}. in an instant (to the believer
in that sanctified fluid) a gush of the warmest benevolence, an emanation
of the heavenliest love. - -
“Here, for example, is a specimen of the celestial manna of the Tablet
—transformed by demoniacal agency into fellest aconite; which baneſul
plant, by the way, Protestant malignity calls monkshood. It appears—
to eyes that have not been opened by holy water-in, the Tableſ of
August 16th, under the head of Fifth Letter of the Rey; Dº.
CAHILL to the People of Ireland.’ And thus runs the Devil's
perversion of the epistle of the holy DR. CAHILL :—
“But, fellow-countrymen, England shall not have everything her own way. We
are now forming a society, such as never has been seen in Ireland before . It will be a
society fairly embodying the mind, and the heart, and the service, of every man,
woman, and child, in these kingdoms; and we shall live and die in defence of the deci-
sion of this new, and glorious, and (with the blessing of God) triumphant association.
Depend upon it that England has sapped her own foundations; depend upon me that
France is not settled, and that Europe owes England a grudge, which never will or can
be forgiven. Be convinced that, if PRINCE ALBERT originated one hundred Exhibitions,
and that the London Corporation dined, and slept, and lived with the French function-
aries every day and night for seven years, be convinced that after all this display of
artful civilities, there is not one Frenchman, or one Frenchwoman, or one French child, who
would not dance with frantic joy at the glorious idea of having an opportunity before they
die of burying their eager swords, and plunging the crimsoned French steel into the in most
heart of every man bearing the hated name of Englishman. Therefore keep up your
courage, and wait your opportunity in a strictly legal attitude, and England will be very
soon in your power. We shall now demand perfect equality from our oppressors. We
shall demand the complete annihilation of the temporalities of the Protestant Church;
and I tell you that we shall have all England at our back. We shall have the moral
support of all Europe, and the sympathy of the civilised world. We are now com-
mencing a struggle which shall end either in our entire emancipation, or in a conflict
which shall shake Great Britain to her centre.”
“The italics, merely, in the above, are mine; the language is the
devil's own. Here you have, apparently put forth in the chief Catholic
newspaper, ostensibly with the authority of a Catholic priest, a manifest
suggestion of desertion and treason to our Catholic troops; and not
only that, but an evident revelling in the idea of English bloodshed,
wherein, with half an enlightened eye, may be detected the workings of
the diabolical mind. What must the poor Protestant, whose feelings of
natural indignation have not been mortified by the influence of the only
true Church, say, on reading this devilish stuff? What! but that the
only answer which it deserves, is such as may be given by twelve men
in a ". and a judge on the bench! The poor natural Protestant
would be wrong, of course. Instead of resenting the fiendish ferocity
of the pretended priest CAHILL, he ought to weep over it, and pray
for the conversion of the supposed savage. But, alas!, it is only
Catholics who behave in this angelic manner under similar circum-
stances. Then, how truly Satanic, to palm off upon society, as the
writing of a clergyman of our Holy Church, the following inter-
mixture of falsehoods and devil's blessings, which I also extract from
the appearances of DR. CAHILL's fifth letter in the Tablet:—
“‘LoRD John Russell has appointed a festival, to be held every year on the 4th of
November, to burn the blessed Virgin, and to spit on the Cross; and the British Com-
mons (long life to them), and the British Lords (glory to them), and the illustrious
QUEEN of ENGLAND (may God bless her), have, with one voice, decided that all the
Catholic ladies of Great Britain and Ireland are prostitutes (this is the word), and that
their children's children are bastards by the laws of England!'
tº º
ying beast!” exclaims indignant Protestantism. ‘Malicious
hound! Édºu. detestable traitor! And this is the language
of you, Catholic priest, is it, as expressed in your great Catholic
p
“I have simply to reply, my very dear Sir, that the only genuine
portions of the foregoing paragraph are the benedictions it contains,
with which the rest of the Rev. DR. CAHILL's real letter is quite in
keeping. The demon has transfigured that gentleman's phrases into
semblances of evil, as he metamorphosed himself once into a form of
loveliness when he appeared in the desert to ST. ANTONY. As to the
real CAHILL, the original SIMON PURE, so mild a pº is that holy
man, that butter literally will not melt in his mouth—a fact which has
been proved by the evidence of seven millions of witnesses; to which I
may add the humble testimony, my very dear Sir, of
“Your faithful Servant,
* WERAX.”
“P.S. The Tempter, under the mask of . DR., CAHILL, writes
nonsense as well as wickedness. Speaking of England, he says–
“She has added fifty-two millions of money to the field of her commerce, filched
and extracted from the weakness of her neighbours; and she has been enabled, at the
same time, to strike a deadly blow at the Catholic Church, which has disabled her for the
moment.'
“The Evil One clearly made this last assertion with a view to
inflame English prejudice against Bulls.” “V”
THREE MONTHS AT SEA WITH A PIPER!!!
WE saw in the Times (August 6th) an advertisement from a strange
individual, describing himself as “a Piper,” and, amongst other recom-
mendations, saying, that he was perfectly ready for
AN ENGAGEMENT, to go to the Shooting with any Gentleman, or would
go to sea as Piper on board any of HER MAJESTY's vessels, and would make himself
generally useful.
Amongst “the pleasures of travelling,” we doubt if a Scotch Piper
was ever before included as one of the requisites. We would as soon
travel with a German Brass-band continually at our heels, or take the
monster Italian Organ, on four wheels, as a travelling-companion.
Besides, wouldn’t “the Piper” be a little in the way of the shooting?
Instead of helping to bring down the game, wouldn't he only frighten
it away ? A bird might stand fire, but we doubt if the boldest specimen
of the whole feathery tribe could stand the Bagpipes | But, if a plan
should be wanted for driving all the game out of England, in the same
way that St. PATRICK drove the reptiles out of Ireland, we beg to
recommend the above proposal of “the Piper” as the one best adapted for
that object. Let him only walk through England, with his instrument in
full blow, and all the poulterers might as well shut up shop, for not
another head of game will they ever be able to sell after the experiment!
We should see the poor distracted birds flying, in large clouds, out of
England, never, never, never to come back again! As for the second
half of the offer, we cannot conceive any individual insane enough to
shut himself up in the same yacht with a Piper! Depend upon it, if
he was not already stark staring mad at the time of sailing, that he
could not help, before he had been three months at sea, coming home
in a hopeless state of incurable º As for ourselves, we would
refuse to sail in any vessel that had the Bagpipes on board. The
knowledge of having such an instrument of torture in the same vessel
with us would produce in our breast such a feeling of sea-sickness as
would be the i. of us in less than one week!—which would not
be, we are afraid, the pleasantest way, for either party, of “Paying
the Piper.”
The Chinaman and his Wives.
CHUNG-ATTAI, and his brace of wives—his two better halves—
have been introduced to the QUEEN and the PRINCE at Osborne.
An illustrious lady was heard to remark that for one husband to have
a couple of wives, seemed an odd way of matching China; very like
giving one cup to two saucers.

OR
THE
THE WINTER GARDEN.
AIR.—“CUPID's Garden” (Rustic Melody).
AS down the Winter Garden in
fancy I did go,
Imet a gallant Colon EL that
most of you must know;
He wore a magnifier, an
held it to his :
And at the Ingy shrubs and
trees continually did spy,
Continually did spy.
sº I presently, accosted, him,
- and gently thus did say,
“Dost thee approve of this
here plan f Come, tell me
now, I pray.”
“I do approve of this here
Fº candidly declare,
P
| - hope that
| Axton may still the
- laurels wear,
May still the laurels wear.”
“Excuse me, gallant Colon EL; there’s no offence design'd:
I think as how I’ve heard that you warn’t always of this mind.”
“You speak the words of truth, which I freely will allow;
But my opinion’s alter'd, and f feel quite different now, .
I feel quite different now.”
“What chang-ed your opinion, might I beg you for to state P”
“Oh! I’m open to conviction; though 'tis sometimes rather late;
But there is no resisting this fair and lovely view
Of plants from Madagascar, and Chayny, and Peru,
And Chayny, and Peru.”.
“I pray you, gallant Colonel, to walk along with me
About the Winter Garden, its wonders for to see,
All in among the spice-trees, and scented gums and balms,
And the ferns of foreign climates, and the date-trees, and the palms,
The date-trees, and the palms.
|
“Look, here is the banana a-bearing of its fruit,
And here you’ve got the plantain, and the cocoa-nut to boot;
The coffee-plant in berry you also here may see,
And likewise the prickly-pear and the Ingy-rubber-tree,
#. Ingy-rubber-tree.
“And here’s the splendid orchises, so beautiful and rare,
That grows on trees, and only lives on water and on air;
And flowers, like moths and butterflies, and insects that appear,
And plants, with leaves like pitchers, that would hold a pint of beer,
Would hold a pint of beer.
“And here we have the vargint flower, which, if attention’s guy,
Will be found to have inside it a figure like a dove;
There you observe the fly-catcher, whereon there grows a trap,
Which, if a fly gets into it, will nab him with a snap,
Will nab him with a snap.
“The grand Wictoria Regia here before us you behold,
And which I think you’ll own comes up to all that you’ve been told;
And there you see the children, and the maidens sweet and fair,
That in the Winter Garden have come to take the air,
Have come to take the air.
*Now, ben’t this, gallant Colon EL, ablessing to the Town?
And yet ’tis said they meant to pull the Crystal Palace down.”—
*Ah! then I should have triumph’d—but here I should not be;
And HER MAJESTY's Commissioners would have been as wise as me,
Have been as wise as me.”
MAN AND WOMAN TRAPS SET HERE.
That is, at a certain Matrimonial Registration Office, in Chancery
Lane; where a philanthropist—for only the price of five shillings for
“registration,” guarantees to make “parties” happy who are “strangers
to each other.” MR. CALCRAFT, the an, always delicately
alludes to the condemned as “the party;” the Hymen of Chancery
Lane is no less scrupulous in his office; albeit of the two functions the
latter might be even more disastrous to those who fell into the hands
of the match-maker.
However, at the “Matrimonial Alliance Office”—(it might have been
the Hand-in-Hand)—everybody may be matched, “from the tradesman
to the Peer;” good tradesmen's wives, and unexceptionable peers’
daughters always on hand in every variety,
Felicity is guaranteed “on the principle of inviolable secresy;” we
will vouch for it, neither party ever dreaming of their happiness. There
is, moreover, this advantage: “applicants may sign by initial or motto;”
the bliss being more intense if obtained anonymously!
“None but respectable parties can be treated with.”
Such is the declaration of the “Secretary,” whose bill is before us.
With this intimation, we beg to hand the matter over to the attention
of that very respectable body—the “parties” of the new police...Perhaps
Inspector A. will favour the Secretary with his initial; and with it, his
motto—“safe bind, safe find.”

AWEUL FIRE AT DUBLIN.
(From our own Reporter.)
On Tuesday morning, August 19th, an extensive fire broke out in
Dublin; and, though happily unattended with loss of life, there are too
done considerable age to property, as the real victims of its
|ravages will be the producers of wealth; that is to say, the industrious
| classes. For some days, suspicious-looking columns of smoke had been
| observed to issue from the office of the Tablet newspaper; and a smell
of fire had been distinctly perceptible in various quarters of the city,
especially in and about the Roman Catholic ë. but on Tuesday,
at 9 A.M., the odour became general, and by 11, flames were seen
ascending in several directions. A Protestant placard was in a few
moments reduced to ashes, and a shop-front, of the same persuasion,
shared a similar fate. For a short time the flames were suppressed by
the praiseworthy efforts of the Police; but, between 11 and 12 o'clock,
they again burst forth in the Rotunda, which, being filled with the
most inflammable materials, rendered a conflagration unavoidable.
Bishop of TUAM, and other pretended Archbishops and Bishops of
Ireland, the spacious edifice contained a vast collection of those prelates
whose vestments are so extensively employed as combustibles among
our junior population on the Fifth of November. A great number of
lay figures, inclusive of those of MEssRs. REYNoLDs and KEogh, M.P.,
were likewise collected together, and from their known facility of
ignition, the greatest danger was apprehended. The gilded chair of the
so-called Asciinishop of ARMAGH was speedily in a blaze; the fire
appearing to emanate from the lips of his nominal Grace. In a few
moments several Romanist ecclesiastics and Members of Parliament
were in flames; and the devouring element then seized on DR. M'HALE,
rendering him almost instantaneously incandescent. Several other
notorious individuals present afterwards kindled in succession; MR. G.
MooRE, M.P. for Mayo, flaring up with terrific vehemence, and the
whole assembly were soon involved in a lurid glare, and emitted dense
volumes of smoke.
At the outset of the fire, Mr. Punch was sent for; and with the
National Fire Brigade, of which he is the head, attended with his usual
promptitude, and lost no time in setting his engine to play upon the
flames. By the exertions of Mr. Punch, the fire was in some measure
got under, but not until considerable mischief had been done: besides
which, it is rumoured that some of the parties involved will be found to
have severely burnt their fingers. The perils of the conflagration were
much enhanced by certain titular prelates pouring oil upon ardent
|spirits, of which there was a stock in the building. Although
the fire has been ially subdued, there is some reason to apprehend
its spreading, and the engine of Mr. Punch will continue to play on the
blazing ruins. The principal sufferers were insured in the Irish
Assurance Office. There is every reason to believe that the fire was
the work of ani iary.
ONE FOOL MAKES MANY.
WE wonder why it is that no equestrian entertainment seems to be
complete without an ascent on an inclined plane by somebody on a
revolving ball. Whoever can do this, may be said to have the ball at
his feet; for he is sure of an engagement just now when the town is full
of horsemanship, and this piece of perilous assmanship is invariably
added to the programme. We should imagine the public have had
|enough of this entertainment, having been bored over and over again by
the same sort of thing. We almost wonder it is still attractive, for as
the attraction is in the danger, and it does not seem to be dangerous,
since nobody has yet broken his neck, and the thing is being done some
thirty or forty times a week in different parts of London, we are
surprised people go on paying their money on the chance of a neck
being broken.
Miº good grounds for apprehending that it will be ultimately found to have

OUR bridges used to be one of
the prides of our Metropolis, but
they are now, alas! becoming our
disgrace. We have no right to
quarrel with the bridge that carries
us safely over, but we feel, we
have a right to quarrel with West-
minster and Blackfriars, for their
carrying us safely over has long
been a matter of doubt. The
bridges may be all very well in the
abstract, but they are so shaky
in the concrete, that if we trust
ourselves to the premises, we may
have to lament a premature con:
clusion. The fact is, that it won't
do to let a bridge rest upon its
own merits alone; for, if it does,
it is sure sooner or later to give
way.
The Cry is still They Can't
Come.
THE New Road has taken the
complaint of so many of the
London streets and thorough-
fares, and a general breaking-up
of the system has been the result.
The fact is, that in the parish of
St. Pancras the Wood Demon has
been at work. It is all very well
to quote the maxim, that “ W.
there’s a will, there’s a way,”
but the traveller who has a will to
go from Euston Square to King's
Crosswill find there is nowayatall.

PU N C H AT T H E PLAY.
A VISIT TO DRURY LANE.
If a modern Thomson were to wish to write another poem on the
“Seasons,” he would find novelty—at least of subject—in the Seasons of
Drury Lane. Some people are said to live a whole life in an hour, and
Drury Lane, most certainly, lives through several seasons in a single
ear. It generally begins about October, as the “Home of the
rama,” and finishes, about August, as the “Stable of Atar Gull.”
It starts with a “Popular Trage ian” in Autumn, and comes to the
“Acknowledged Man Monkey” before the Summer is at an end. The
worst of it is, that when it is the “Home of the Drama,” there are
scarcely any callers, except a few renters, who drop their compli-
mentary cards at the door, while the horse, “Atar Gull,” can boast a
nightly crowd of visitors. The “Popular Tragedian * gets plenty of
empty—ruinously empty—praise; but the “Acknowledged Man-
Monkey” receives substantial proofs of acknowledgment at the hands
of nightly crowds.
We will not ask why it is but, so it is; and, declining to ask
the question, whether it is caused by the dinner hour, the expense
of keeping the house dusted, the Italian Operas, the want of
actors, the high salaries, the dearth of pieces, or any other of the
hundred-and-fifty reasons usually assigned for the ruin of the large
theatres,-we pass on to the fact, that Drury Lane answers very well
for nearly everything but the purpose to which it is conventionally
assigned.
... We paid a visit, a few evenings ago, and entered a crowded house,
just as the “Acknowledged Man-Monkey” was going through his
“delineations of the monkey tribe.” As a zoological study, we should
say the “delineations” would be rather deceptive, and the student of
the habits of monkey life must not trust too implicitly to the “Acknow-
ledged Man-Monkey’—is the acknowledgment in writing?—at Drury
Lane. Afterwards, we found the “Brothers ELLIOTT,” with their
“Drawing-room Entertainments,” which caused us to wonder, where
the Drawing-room may be in which such entertainments could be con-
veniently carried on. The “Brothers” throw themselves, and each
other, about in a manner that would be fatal to any of those little
objects of knick-knackery to be found in drawing-rooms of even the
humblest pretension. We cannot imagine ourselves sitting in a salon,
and being bounded in upon by three youths in spangles—and scarcely
anything else—one of whom throws himself down on his back on
the hearth-rug, while another jumps on to the hands of his recumbent
brother, and is pitched, head-over-heels, into the middle of the room.
The foreigners who visit Drury Lane will, we trust, not go away
with the idea that our drawing-rooms are the scene of such proceedings;
and we must particularly warn them against the idea that at R
MAJESTY's Drawing-room there are any entertainments of the kind.
There never was so much horse-riding in the Metropolis as at the
resent moment. London might easily be divided, like Yorkshire, into
its North and West Riding. Drury Lane might rank as the capital
of the former; whilst for the latter, Cremorne, the Hippodrome,
: Astley’s might each claim the same epithet in its own peculiar
circle.
At Drury Lane, the Riding takes a higher bound than we have ever
witnessed in a similar arena. Their ambition seems to be of the most
vaulting description; the great merit of which, often as it leaps,
until counting becomes a bore, is that it never “o'erleaps itself.”
There is a grand game, called “Battoute Leaping,” in which the art of
leaping is carried to the very greatest .. “One fellow leapt so
tarnation high,” the American clown informed us, “that though he
went up quite a boy—in the spring-time of his existence—he never
came down till he was an old man, with a family of ten children.” The
aéronauts must be rather afraid of this new Yankee sect of Jumpers;
for they º up as high as sky-rockets, and then whiz round and roun
in the air like so many Catharine-wheels. If one of them came in
collision with a balloon, the bouleversement might not be exactly
pleasant.
The Clowns belong to the talkative genus of clowns; but then it must
be recollected they spring from an American race, which may account
somewhat for their loquacity. If anything, they talk too much.
“I talk so fast,” said one of them, “that it takes Echo six months
before it can give me an answer—and that’s a fact. I talk so tarnation
quick that no steam-engine can follow me; and in Kentucky, nineteen
old women, at a tea-party, died on the spot of vexation, because they
couldn’t P. in a single word, and if that isn't the truth I’m
blessed, if my wiſe mayn't run away, and never come back again.”
But still they can be as nimble with their feet as with their tongues.
The funny way in which one of them danced a quadrille all by himself
was proof of this facility. The difference between the Ancient an
Modern Quadrille, was given with a degree of point, which we have
rarely noticed in the toe of a Clown before, excepting, perhaps, the
resent wearer of GRIMALDI's mantle (and very hot it must be to wear
in this weather), MR. FLEXMoRE.
The Drury Lane play-bill gives the names of the horses and the
riders, but the names of the Clowns are studiously buried in the deepest
sawdust. We think this looks a little like Jealousy. The same mystery
is preserved with the Master of the Ring. If the same exclusive spirit

American Master, in point of ºl. and juvenility, lags at least

Auºreste (as JENKINs would say), the Drury Lane Company boasts of
the same number of wonderful horses as any of its wonderful rivals.
There are horses who fire off pistols; who dig up hidden purses; pick up
handkerchiefs and hand them, on their hind legs, to their legitimate
owners; who grind a hurdy-gurdy (“that's a fact,” as the Clown would
say), and dance the Golitska or the Cachucha, or any dance you please.
They jump through hoops, and over bars and scarfs, and run along the
edge of º barrier of the Circus. . In short, the wonderful creatures
do everything but speak. We imagine, however, that this accomplish-
ment, even, they will soon be tutored to acquire, and that before lon
we shall hear }.}}| played by an highly-trained stud of horses, an
we will be bound that they would play it quite as well as any company
which has been at Drury Lane, since MACREADY left it. In the mean-
time, until the horses learn to speak, the performances are well worth
going to see, for many of them are so clever that they speak for
themselves.
A FAMILY PARTY.
The Times, of the 18th instant, had one of the oddest advertisements
we have seen for many a day; an advertisement summoning all people
of the name of JENNINGs to a public meeting. It seems that some
roperty has been left by a JENNINGs, and the question is, which
º ENNINGs is to have it * The entire body, consequently, are to meet
together, with their pedigrees, to determine the matter. Hamlet talks
of his being “a little more than kin and less than kind;.” the passage
is obscure, but we think the forthcoming meeting likely to illustrate it.
Considering the party and the object, we †: there will be more
eople there than are likely to be “kin,” and something considerably
ess than kindness existent among them.
How is business to be managed MR. JENNINGs must take the
chair, and MR. JENNINGs must move the first resolution, and MR.
JENNINGs must rise to move an amendment, and MR. JENNINGs must
appeal to all the JENNINGSEs to be heard against MR. JENNINGS in the
sº who insists on order. If two gentlemen rise to speak together,
who is to settle which is to have the hearing P
of both cry out, “JENNINGs JENNINGs l’” How can any speaker
designate the last speaker with clearness? He cannot begin,
“Gentlemen, MR. JENNINGs has told you”—there will be a cry from
everybody present, “No, I didn't!” As for personality, that will
luckily be nearly impossible; it will be impracticable to insult a MR.
JENNiNgs in the presence of so many. . Exchanging cards will be of no
use in this case. Out of the dozens of JENNINGSEs on every variety of
pasteboard, how pick out your JENNINGs how select the man you
desire to call to account P The thing is awful to contemplate 1 Our
Christian names are not various enough to meet the difficulty; there
must be dozens of ToMs, and JACKs, and HARRYs, among the
multitude
They are called ostensibly as relatives, these JENNINGSEs. But who
does not see that it will be the interest of everybody to repudiate his
neighbour? Call one your first cousin, and you admit the possibility of
his being from an elder brother, and so nearer the common ancestor.
No. Everybody will insist that he is the only genuine JENNINGs; that,
like a bottle of the real KING OF OUDE's sauce, he alone has the genuine
name of the producer. There will be a fine overhauling of the pedigrees,
we may be sure. “That’s my great-grandfather, sº Sir,
mine !” Parish registers will be at a premium, and tombstones precious
stones, indeed, on the occasion. Many a jºnnings, we fancy, w
feel inclined to hang himself on the genealogical tree before the
business is over.
One consolation, at least, suggests itself—that the bearers of the
name of SMITH have not yet been summoned. No, no! The darkest
malignity only could suggest a step like that. If that comes off, why,
we must shut our shops, call out our specials, and prepare for the worst.

REMARKABLE CROCODILE FOUND IN IRELAND.
LITERARY ECLIPSE.
We hope, the printers will take the precaution to damp, with additional moisture, the
sheets on which our present number is printed, as we are about to introduce a piece of
brilliancy from, a Sunderland paper, which is really enough to burn everything else com-
º out. The writer, wishing to communicate the fact that the sun set on a certain
day, bursts forth into the following literary blaze. Our Sunderland contemporary can
scarcely be safe with such a fiery genius on the premises, which we trust are amply insured.
We feel it a sort of duty to throw cold water upon this luminary, and put him out. Now,
reader, take, care. If you have got a pair of green spectacles, put them on before you
read, the following, or get a piece of smoked glass. Are you ready? Now, then, let the
Sunderland luminary fire away:—
“The rest of the evening, and especially before sunset, the heavens presented the most glorious aspect we
ever remember to have witnessed. The blue expanse beyond, seemed more pure, stainless, and incorruptible,
than ever feasted our visual orbs before. Interspersed, as it was, with calm companies of gold-fringed, curling
cloudlets, that reposed in the most tranquil and holy rest on the breast of this stainless canopy; and the
floods of golden light that streamed with tremulous, wavy motions from the mighty orb, as ‘he stood trembling
at the gates of the west,’ electro-plating with burnished gold every hill and tree, every house and spire; and, as
he rolled down among the mountains of clouds that seemed to gather there to form a magnificent temple for
his reception, and which his setting beams invested with such brilliant tints and golden effulgence, we
thought that this was surely a scene enough to make any one, not absolutely irrational, to feel a struggling of
emotions too sweet, and too big for any other utterance than that of silent worship."
We have only one suggestion to make about the author of thisſº h. Let him be
placed in the centre of his own parish, where his brilliancy woul save all the expense of
gas or oil, and realise the most sanguine idea of what might be done with the electric light.
| THE POTATO IN IRELAND.
(For the Kilkenny Cat.)
PoTATo is regene-
rated. Through
the breadth of the
land, the root is
looking up; as if
in defiance of the
scorn and tyranny
of the Saxon. Yes;

the bigotted crew,
who have too long
dominated overthis

saved. ad it pe-

have met with sympathy from Turkey—with consolation from the land of the Great
Mogul. The Hindoo would have stinted himself in his food of rice to have stretched
forth a helping hand across the sea to Ireland; the Esquimaux would have wept like
a brother. Alſnations of all corners of the earth would have sympathised with stricken
Ireland,--whilst the callous, brutal, and calculating Saxon would have gorged himself with
the beef of Ireland's sons. We are saved from this insult, for the potato is sound—
sound as the hearts of Ireland's patriots, beating as they do with brotherhood and peace.

the spoons, they should have left any of the constables behind.

HERALDIC FRAGMENTS.
F singular heraldic objects, there is one
notably so; we mean a lymphad—
which is the heraldic name for a ship.
One of these looks as fit for sailing
as if it had been built by a modern
Admiralty. The DUKEs or ARGYLE
bear a “lymphad with sails thirled
up,” in the second and third quarters
p their shield, as representatives of
the Lords of Lorn—to indicate, we
boat with those old potentates. We
confess that we should be sorry, to
embark our fortunes in a lymphad
anywhere farther down the river than
flags and pennants flying, gules, as pre-
tentiously as it does in the above case.
And we are afraid, though with every
disposition to exclaim, “Row, brothers,
row,” to any worthy master of a
lymphad extant, that these vessels
will be symbolically, as they have been
literally, superannuated by the superior
powers of modern steam-w
We invited our readers last week to
certain Honourable Ordinaries. We
ointed out, the Chief, the Pale, the
hevron. The Fess is not so sus-
ceptible of a festive style of treat-
It is, however, rather an important one
ment as other heraldic objects. It -
—it encloses a third of the shield horizontally across the centre.
Antiquarians suppose it to represent a scarf. The Bar is in the same
tion as the Fess.
The Bend crosses from the dexter chief to the sinister base. It is to
be noted that most of these have their diminutives, little representa-
tives of them on a small scale. The Chief has a fillet—as LoRD John
has his HAwes. There is a half of the Bar, too, called the closet—
typical of the humble space occupied by so many members of the
profession of that name. As to the Bend Sinister, with regard to
which one hears so much said, and which is perhaps the only ordinary
whose name is perfectly familiar to the public, we have to notice an
odd theory regarding it, broached by old GUILLIM, the writer on
Heraldry. That learned man says that the bearing known as the Bend
roperly a baton or cudgel, and is worn to show that
gentlemen l; under the misfortune of having it on their shields,
are liable to be cudgelled as slaves—not being born free! This theory
has been severely reprobated by subsequent writers. But it is satis-
factory to know that whether GUILLIM be right or not, the Bend
Sinister is delicately repudiated by modern families, who give not so
much a sinister as a dexter-ous turn to the matter, by "...; their
arms within a “border wavy” instead. The next age will possibly see
them marching triumphantly “over the border,” and coming out with
shields in a state of primary purity. -
One of the most important matters in Heraldry is the marshalling of
arms, by which is meant the arranging of those “quarterings” which
one becomes entitled to by marriage. A husband has a right to impale
his wife's arms with his own, in an ordinary case—(ah! how often is
this “impalement” a terrible, punishment, hele, as in the East!).--but
if he marries an heiress, (or lady without brothers), he places her shield
on his own, and his son bears both arms “quarterly;” in addition to
which he has a right to all the arms which previous marriages have
brought into the damsel's own house. Hence come those huge batches
of quarterings which your great houses boast. You may pick a selection
of the choicest coats for your carriage out of the whole number—or to
grave on a pewter-pot, as is done by our friend FLUFF. We illustrate
this most romantic branch of Heraldry by a few lines.
A HIER ALID TO HIS IMIISTRIESS.
Dear heiress of the house of Ware,
My heart all gules before you lies;
And, like the birds the MURDochs bear,
Is vulned by your tender eyes.
Slow naiant visions past me shine;
Sweet étoiles glitter on the sense;
I long to bear your arms with mine
On an escutcheon of pretence /
Before your footsteps, as you pass,
May roses barbed and seeded grow;
And gleaming through the rich vert grass,
Sweet Bourbon lilies proper blow !
suppose, that they rowed in the same
Greenwich—even although it displayed
When the dark hatchment on the wall,
All black in f. shows both are gone,
When crests gleam faintly on the pall,
Our honours merge into our son.
He, quarterly, our bearings shows,
in first and fourth my lymphads sail;
Second and third with pride disclose
The crescents that you bear in pale.
A TESTIMONIAL TO THE SULTAN.
“MR. PUNCH,-I write to you from the vats of BARCLAY AND
PERKINs; and am emboldened to do so by the circumstance that, upon
another occasion—to which I needn't more partic’larly allude at this
minute–my pictur, and the pictur of two or three of my mates, had the
honour to find themselves in your widely circ'lated columns. But
that’s not what I’m going to write just now.
“Mr. Punch,--I see by the papers that the SULTAN–like a jolly
Turkey-cock as he is—is going to let out that brave fellow Kossuth
and his companions: let ’em out safe and sound, with not a hole pecked
in their precious skins by that varmint of a double-headed eagle, which
is kept in Austria to feed upon the hearts and vitals of brave men, for
§ . world as they feed the vultures on garbage at the 'Logical
ardens.
“On the 15th of Sºº-ºº: the rs—Kossuth and his friends
are to be free. The SULTAN-(well, 1 only wish the Pope was as, good
a Christian)—the SULTAN wouldn't be bullied into doing the shabby
thing; but, having given his word, he looked upon it like that diamond
that’s being shown at the Glass Palace, above all price,—and the up-
shot is, Kossuth isn’t to be hanged in Austrian rope, but is alive, and
I º will some day be found once again kicking.
“Well, I should like us, as Englishmen, to make what is called a
Testimonial to the SULTAN. I should like to give him something, that
he could look at when he chose; and see in it a proof that John BULL
loved, and honoured him—Turk, and infidel as they call him—for
standing like a noble fellow—and that, too, as I hear, when he was none
of the strongest—between the butcher and the brave.
“Me and some of my mates have been thinking over the matter;
and it’s our opinion that we could give nothing to the Sultan that
would be more grateful to his feelings as a Sultan, a gentleman, and a
good-hearted fellow as he is—nothing more grateful than a noble
gallon tankard, "..."; or all gold, if there’s money enough. Yes, a
gallon tankard, carved outside with hº and hooped like a barrel,
and writ with a proper inscription, that the piece of plate may go down
all his family as long as Turkey stands.--'T † be a fine thing,
wouldn't it? Always standing on the sideboard when any of the
'bassadors from Austria or Russia dropt in upon bus'ness? Do you
know, Mr. Punch, I do think Old England might be worse represented
in what is called the eyes of foreign powers. .
“Any way, Mr. Punch, just set, the thing going, and you may rely
upon subscriptions from one and all of
“Your humble Servants,
“BARCLAY AND PERKINs's DRAYMEN.”
.*P.S. We do think that the tankard shouldn't go to Constantinople
without a butt of our XXXXX. (and stronger than that, if you like). I
know that Mussulmans don't drink wine; but there’s no law 'gainst
hops. At least I should think so; for a good many Turks, now and
then, º come to see us; and don’t they see the bottom of the

A Check to Blooming.
IT is said that three females—wife and daughters of an innocent sea-
captain now on blue water—have appeared in the public promenade of
Belfast in full Bloomer costume. Punch has received various intima-
tions of an attempt in certain quarters of England at full Blooming;
and has been asked his advice upon the exigency. Punch has to pro-
pound an instant remedy. If women assume the dress of men, let them
undertake men's duties: hence, every Bloomer shall be liable to be
drawn for the militia, without benefit of substitute.

not of a regiment—but of the whole Irish Bar. Of course, the relation-
ship, if it exists, can only be by adoption, though we never yet heard of
the lawyers in a body adopting a young lady, unless she happens to be
a ward in Chancery—which we trust is not the case with the bride of
the paragraph. An opera called the Daughter of the Bar might make
a pendant to the Daughter of the Regiment—though the interest of the
former would be serious in the extreme. A Rataplan, with the usual
Chancery refrain of “Tin, tin,” would be highly effective; and as to
accompaniments, the dominant instrument would be the Gross case, of
which the Court has always an abundant supply.

FROM OUR LONDON CORRESPONDENT.
(For the Kilkenny Cat.)
F course you will not be sur-
prised at another attack by
the Saxon upon the last shred
of prosperity that, fluttering,
hangs upon our insulted coun-
try. Yes; the measure of our
wrongs is now full and run-
ming over. The emerald—like
the pearl of old—is dissolved
sº in the nitric acid of England,
tº Was it likely that the Crystal
Palace, as it is called, would
have passed away, without
leaving another wound on the
bleeding breast of Ireland?
It was not enough that that
fabric was raised by Irish skill
– that Irishmen hammered
the iron—and Irish glaziers,
as our own MooRE sings, “cut
their bright way through” a
million panes of glass;–not
enough that, to the very struc-
ture of the shamrock, MR,
PAxton owed his notion of
the form of his Crystal Temple
-(though, of course, all the
honour and glory of the idea
was given to the Victoria Lily)
—but, that a new prize ex-
pressly awarded º the Com-
missioners should be added to
the list, in order to outrage our beloved country ! -
Will it be believed—but why do I ask?—that a prize of enormous
value has been º to a person of the name of -I forget, but no
doubt of an Irishman—for the invention of a machine (an infernal
machine!) to be worked by steam; a machine that, in one day, shall
reap as much corn as would fall beneath the sinewy arms of a hundred-
power Irishman? Yes; the corn of the Saxon is to be cut by steam;
and loud is the brutal rejoicing at the fireside of every Saxon farmer.
At every harvest-home, the most exulting speeches have been made—
the most insolent toasts drunk to the success of the steam-labourer, and
the consequent and well-understood confusion of the outraged Irish
reaper.
- #: Irish industry and Irish benevolence, the Scotch and English
fariners have owed the gathering of a thousand harvests. Irish riches
have gleamed like sunbeams in the corn-fields of the º
wait awhile, and “no Irish need apply.” . The armies of CEREs that,
for many a season, have landed at Liverpool, and Bristol, and Glasgow,
spreading themselves over the breadth and length of the land; econo-
mizing their wages, on their return, by condescending to sleep at nights
from Union to Union,-these armies will be disbanded by the mechanical
reaper. The Saxon farmer is delighted with the prospect; and—-I
speak upon the best authority, or would I speak at all?-every night
drinks success to the mechanical reaper, and confusion to the Celt.
Our venerable Doctor CAHILL has, of course, been outraged at
Leeds. Benevolently disposed to teach the benighted Englishman the
true principles of astronomy—as set forth # the College of Rome, and
about to prove the sun one mile and a half in diameter, ºf to
the authority of His Holiness—that astral luminary was attacked b
the bigots, but has since come out from the contest in all the triump
of intelligence and purity; having eaten his words like a mess of
buttered beans, to the confusion of his accusers. Oh! it was a
beautiful scene to behold—a great moral aspect to contemplate—to
think of Doctor CAHILL, as an astronomical lecturer, teaching the
bigotted Saxon the machinery of the heavenly bodies, as accredited by
the Court of Rome!
I have also to inform you—and I do it rejoicingly—that LQRp John
Russell has already directed a Government prosecution of Doctor
CULLEN' The Premier will have his £100; and if it were a hundred
hundred, all the better; for wouldn’t the money leap from the pockets
of the flocks for the honour and glory of the martyr F. Of course, the
jury will be packed. I may next week send you the names of the
Protestant slaves selected by the Government for the dirty doing!
I must—in my duty of your own reporter—allude to other matters,
I must tell you that London is flat, collapsed, dead, laid out, after the
Glass Show. The greatest news, is a giantess, from Lapland; she has
only been here a week or two, but I understand contemplates an imme-
diate return to her own country, finding London so mighty dull.
And I had nearly forgot—the drama is taking a start. R. BARNUM
has enriched the stage with two little girls of the name of BATEMAN:
they play, among other things, Richard III. and Richmond, and make
the very least of them. The public is further assured that the little
girls can neither read nor write; a fact at which the public must
rejoice mightily. I have heard that the way to improve the notes of
singing-birds, is to put out their eyes; and, in like manner, to keep an
actor in the dark may be the best way of teaching acting. Mr. Bºrºus
has, however, delicately suppressed one fact—it is this:—He might, if
he liked—(and, for all I’d answer to the cont
prove the little BATEMANs, to be lineally descended from the distin-
guished LoRD BATEMAN, “who was a noble peer,” and who, in his
pilgrimage. to various countries, contracted a private marriage in
America; from which union have descended Richard III. and Richmond.
There can be no doubt, had BARNUM minded, he might have proved
this; and have further illustrated the fact, by showing the BATEMAN
family arms marked in the nape of the neck of either actress. Perhaps,
however, this may remain over until the “benefit.”

And all de people in de world to look at you dey go,
And say you am de finest ting dat 'Merica can show.
But though you am a lubly gal, I say you no correct;
You not at all de kind ob slave a nigger would expect;
You never did no workee wid such hands and feet as dose;
You different from SUsANNAH, dere, you not like coal-black Rose.
Dere’s not a mark dat I see ob de cow-hide on your back;
No slave hab skin so smooth as yourn—dat is, if slavee black.
Gosh!, if I war a slave again, all down in Tennessee
In such a skin as that of yourn is where I’d like to be.
I’spose de reason why your face look mellumcholly sad,
Is 'cause dey gone and torn you from your lubber and your dad.
How hard say Massa JonATHAN-oh, what a cruel shame!

... “I Don't know, whether, practical jº. are among the ab-
surdities you dealin. I dare say they are. I hate popular education.
I detest philanthropic associations and all such humbug, Then,
possibly, it was you, or some of your writers, who played me the trick
of sending me a copy of the Hampshire Independent, containing the
report of a Ragged School Meeting at Southampton, with a number
of passages in it, considered, I suppose, contrary to my views, and
therefore marked, and underlined. hoever, the jackanapes was, he
has not succeeded in rovoking me—not at all. If the object was to
convince me, I can only say that it has equally failed. I am not to be
imposed upon by such ridiculous anecdotes as those related by the
REv. J. BRANchi. But others are—weak-minded persons who are
troubled with, sympathy, as they call it—and are touched., Yah!
touched, indeed, by such stuff and nonsense as this, which is calculated
to soften—the feelings, they say, but I say the head:-
“‘A short time ago, a boy, about thirteen years of age, called at his (MR. BRANch's)
house, and said he wanted to see him. He was shown in, much to the terror of the
servant, who by no means relished his appearance, when, said the reverend gentleman,
the following colloquy took place:–'Well, my boy, what do you want?’ ‘Why, Sir,
I heard you preach a sermon, last night.” “Did you? Where?’ ‘At the Ragged
School, and your text was this:–Give to him that asketh of thee; and from him that
would borrow of thee turn not thou away. Now, I am come to borrow of you, and I hope
you will act up to your text." (Laughter). “Well, my boy, what do you want to
borrow? and what have you been in the habit of doing for a living?' 'Why, Sir, I
have been a thief, and have been lagged four times; but if I had ninepence, to set me
up in selling ingans, I would earn honest grub.” “I lent the poor boy a shilling,' said
MR. BBANch, “which he insisted on re-paying me, at the rate of threepence a-week,
and because I would not take any interest, he one morning, unobserved, threw a bunch
of onions into my room.’
“Never would have paid a farthing. Threw in the onions out of
mere impudence. Idle young rascals have served me the same way—
unobserved. Only wish I could have caught 'em!
“MR. BRANch may be a well-meaning man; but—don't suppose, Sir,
I aim at a paltry witticism—I must say I think this BRANCH extremely
green. He observes, that
“‘The answers given by some of the boys in the Ragged Schools, to questions put to
them, were most remarkable for quickness and pathos.'
“Pathos!—the sort of thing, I believe—whatever that is—that some

people find to cry at in a playhouse. Ragged Infant RoscIUSEs, I
suppose—much good they will come toſ Quickness?–Yes, Sir,
especially on the approach of a policeman, I’ll warrant you. . But, now
for the example: which is what I should call simply an instance of
sauciness and impertinence.
“‘One poor little fellow, who was very ragged, when asked if he had a mother,
replied, 'Do I look as if I had a mother, Sir?”
“A mere piece of street slang, Sir. Does your mother know you’re
out?”—“Oh, don’t I love my mother!’—all the same sort of thing—
what we hear every day of our lives from the little ragamuffins who
stand on their head and walk on their hands about the pavement; a
most dangerous practice—as the sight is enough to give a nervous
person a vertigo.
“Again:—Under an archway, one winter’s morning, MR. BRANCH
observed what he mistook for a bundle of rags; but,
“‘On approaching it he found two little boys, the one almost nine, the other almost six
years of age, huddled together, and almost perished with the cold. The arm of the
elder boy was round his brother's neck, and was quite stiff with the frost; and when he
was asked why he kept it so long in that position, he promptly answered—'Sir, my
brother is younger than I, and I am trying to keep him warm.' Here was a touch of
natural affection that had never been surpassed.'
“I beg MR. BRANch’s pardon, Sir. I have seen these young
monkeys surpassed in the same way by those in the Zoological Gardens,
often, Sir—very often. In one part of MR. BRANCH's address I rather
coincide. Appealing in behalf of Ragged Schools to persons of all
denominations,
“If my house were on fire,' said the speaker, “I should not ask the men at the
engines whether they were Churchmen, Baptists, Wesleyans, or Independents; but I
should say—Pump, away, lads, pump away.' (Loud cheers). He would also say, in
this great and good work—"Pump away.'
“So should I, Sir, if any amount of pumping would make the little
varlets clean. But you might as well try to wash a blackamoor white,
Sir ; for all your tº: and wash-houses, which are another innovation,
and, like your Ragged Schools, will soon, I suppose, extend into the
provinces, and we shall have all the lower orders, at. Southampton and
everywhere else, indulging in luxuries and acquiring learning above
their station, through your philanthropic system of “pumping.’
“I am, Sir, by several years, your

water on Ragged Schools.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 107
ANN HICKS TO F. M. THE DUKE.
(Favoured by Mr. Punch.)
Mrs. ANN Hicks—through Mr. Punch—presents her duty to Field.
Marshal, the DUKE and Conqu’ror in 100 Fights; and having had her
eye drawn to F. M. the DUKE’s letter, which appeared in the news-
papers reflecting upon her; and feeling that the meanest subject as is
can plead a habeas corpus, having in the poorest English garret the
strongest castle, MRs. ANN HIcks offers her duty, and as a lone
woman hopes to be permitted one word. Strike but hear, is the
motto of every Briton; and MRs. ANN Hicks—saving the presence of
F. M. the Duke—trusts, whatever LORD SEYMoUR may insinuate to
the contrary—that she has mot, and never will, forfeit her proudest
birthright, which is to feel that the newspaper press is like the air she
used to breathe in Hyde Park, if she has it not, she dies.
F. M. the DUKE takes it upon him to write to MR. GRIFFITHs of the
Anti-Enclosures—
“The DUKE does not exactly understand what connexion is supposed to exist
between his house in Piccadilly and Mrs. Hicks's cottage. The Duke purchased
from the Crown his property in Piccadilly.”
MRs. Hicks is the last woman upon the earth as would dispute an
account with F.M. the DUKE, who no doubt has filed his receipt for
Apsley House, which may it cover F. M. many Waterloo Banquets, the
Grenadiers never giving up the Conqu'ring Hero Coming, with God
Save the Queen and the rest of the royal family. -
MRs. Hicks says nothing against the DUKE's bargain about his
house in Piccadilly; but Mrs. Hicks would be less or more than, a
woman (which she has no wish to be, one way or the other) if she
didn’t feel the following as a stab:—
“MRs. Hicks is neither more nor less than a squatter on the retaining banks of
the Serpentine river.”
That’s it—“squaTTER l’” That’s the blow ! MRs. ANN Hicks
must feel it: to be called—and that, moreover, in print—a “squatter”
by the “Hero of a Hundred Fights,” and many more than that, she’s
bound, if they were all told—to go down to her grave as a “squatter,”
—which even Lord SEYMoUR, which is saying a good deal, never called
her before—is too much, with the eyes of Europe, as Mrs. Hicks, feels
tº: one of 'em, looking at her, and at F. M. the DUKE in the
1n.
i. Hicks, moreover, cannot but feel much hurt at what comes
next, as she reads it in the newspapers:—
“The DUKE has frequently considered it his duty to inquire, and he could never
find that MEs. Hicks had any authority whatever to establish herself there.”
MRs. Hicks does feel it partic'larly slighting of F. M. the DUKE
that he didn’t ask her own self about her rights to her stand, which
would have proved to the generous heart of F. M. His Grace that she
was no more a “squatter,” with her humble ginger-beer and inoffensive
apples, and her happy tea-kettle, that would have been singing still but
for the º: of a nobleman as shall be nameless.
MRs. Hicks says, she does feel that she could have proved herself
no more a squatter to F. M., than the DUKE is a squatter to himself;
though, as she hears, F. M. has, perhaps, set down before more places
than she ever dreamed of.
But to conclude, MRs. HICKs presents her humble duty to F. M.
the DUKE, and shall be proud and happy to wait upon his commands,
and to tell to His Grace the varnished story of her wrongs, beginning
with her first standing—(not squatting)—at the bank of the Serpentine,
until she was crushed to the earth by the Woods and Forests.
.P. S.–MRs. Hicks, sees by the papers that LoRD SEYMOUR has put
his keepers in the Park in livery: green frocks—gilt buttons—and red
stripes. MRs. Hicks has no doubt that they look very fine; but for her
own part, she wonders how Lord S-YM-R can look upon those buttons
without thinking of the widow's tears (who was no squatter)—and to
conclude, how he can behold those scarlet stripes without taking to his
bed, and dreaming of an unprotected bleeding heart.
Not far from the Truth.
A short time back, on the first night of a new piece—that is to say,
a new translation—at one of our theatres, (we could name it, but have
no wish to be spiteful), loud cries were raised, when the curtain fell, for
“Author, Author!”. These cries were continued for some time, when
no one appearing, a French gentleman rose in the dress circle, and sai
most seriously, “Ladies º Gentlemen, de author of dis piece is in
Paris.” It is scarcely necessary to state, that after this announcement
the English Author did not make his appearance.
The best Scotch Joke we ever Heard.
A cºver Scotchman, being told that DeMost HENEs was in the habit
of making speeches at the sea-side with small stones in his mouth,
exclaimed, “Hoot, mon! then he must ha’ been the first Member for
Peebles.” (Loud cries of “Apology,” which not being given, the Reader
proceeds to groan.)
“THE LAST NIGHTS OF JULLIEN.”
ORROR-STRUCK were we all
last week to see the walls
of London placarded with
the above terrible announce-
ment. We could not imagine
* || “… what fearful crime JULLIEN
! ~~ | had committed, that his
º t - nights should be numbered
| like those of a common cri-
minal. Knowing that he was
a leader of the greatest exe-
cution, our first impulse was
º - to send off to Newgate to
º make inquiries what sort of
mights the ill-fated Maestro
| d; had lately passed. . We
|h - ° were most anxious to know
J-7& ºil whether, in the phraseology
- of the penny-a-liner, “his
appetite had remained good
to the last,” and whether, “as the termination of his career approached,”
his usual firmness had in the least deserted him? These inquiries,
however, were never made at Newgate, or Horsemonger Lane Gaol,
or anywhere else; for, in the meantime, our forebodings had been
quieted by the agreeable discovery that the “Last Nights” which
had so much alarmed us, had reference merely to an engagement
at the Surrey Zoological. Gardens, where JULLIEN has lately been
flourishing his baton. His ambrosial curls and moustachios, and
ſºlº white waistcoat, have not been sacrificed, we rejoice to say, to
the severe requirements of any prison regulations. Our Jullie N,
thank Heaven! is still preserved to us; but really managers should be
careful not to shatter our nerves by such startling announcements.

CHEAP PERFIDY!
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“IN a defence of the Lord MAYOR's Court, signed “A
Solicitor,’ in the money article of the Times (which I think is always so
interesting), Iread, the other day, that, in that Court,
“‘The costs of an attachment as above, including two counsel's fees, seldom amount
to more than £10 or £12 on each side, let the debt be ever so large.’
“A perjured wretch owes, me at least a thousand a year—which I
know he has got—for blighted hopes and wounded feelings. I suppose
from the word attachment, that the Lond MAYoh’s Court is intende
to do justice to those who have been wronged, like me, in the tenderest
point. But would you, if you were me, bring an action for breach of
promise in a court where £10 or £12 is all the cost of an attachment?

help taking it into our head that there
is, for our own locks give the white lie
to the flattering announcement. It is
true we have not accepted the invita-
tion to go to some Emporium, and
have our poor old head placed in the
dyer's hands; for though we would do
almost anything to render ourselves
agreeable in the eyes of the world, we
are not yet prepared to dye for it.
Besides, we have seen specimens on
some of our female friends, and we
have a great objection to a prismatic
head of hair, which is the usual con-
sequence of an attempt to turn grey
into black, or a decided carrot into a
delicious chestnut.
We should like to see the experi-
ment tried of how far the false might
be made to supersede the true, in that
decided matter of form, the human

are, replaced by artificial means;
teeth, hair, and eyes are to be bought

To Pick the Padlocks that fetter poli-

To Pick as many of the Wards in

To Pick a Quarrel with LoRD JoHN RUSSELL, if something is not

To Pick the Irish Thorn out of the British Lion's Foot. ...
And lastly—to jump from painful subjects to comic—to Pick all over

A NOBLE NOWELIST.
MR. ShoBERL has reason to be proud of at least one of his noble
authors. Our friend the Post speaks of Percy Hamilton, a novel from
the head of LoRD WILLIAM LENNox. It must be now some seven
years since Punch honoured that distinguished writer by a pe:
notice of his merits. It would appear from the Post—for Punch is not
a cannon-ball, and cannot gothrough every book—that the bold LENNox
is as original as ever.
“He [saith the Post] plagiarises right and left, and stows the stolen goods of other
writers into his own book with as little conscience as Oliver, CBoxſwell thrust the key
of the House of Commons into his breeches pocket, after sending the Barebones
Parliament about their business.”
That a noble lord should stow stolen goods into “his own book” is
an original way of making a book “his own;” pocket-handkerchiefs
may become personal property by the like process. However, some-
thing, it appears, ...}. admitted; and it is this:-
“It must be admitted, however, that he often throws a new grace around an old story
by his free and graphic manner of narration, and that many a gem, whose lustre had
been clouded by long usage, shines out with fresh brilliancy when set off by his lucid and
easy dialogue.”
In the like manner that stolen jewels—many a pilfered gem—are set
off at the receiver's by the free and graphic manner of the would-be
vendor. Happy the man—and especially valuable to the tradesman in
noble brains—who, by his lucidity and ease, can turn an old story into
a new one. By these means, the oldest JoE MILLER becomes the
youngest BILL LENNox.
Alexander the Little.
. ALEX. DUMAs, fils, writes in this jaunty fashion to the French
journals:-

CAHILL’S TRAVELS.
A GODLY pilgrim, meek and poor,
I travell'd France from end to end:
I rapp'd at many a cottage door,
For France was ever Erin's fiend.
The farmer's cot, the noble's hall,
The curate's comfortable thatch,-
They gave me shelter, one and all—
Ineeded but to lift the latch.
I knew the rich and poor, and ate
The farmer's soup, the noble's feast;
A kindly welcome ever met
The poor and friendless Irish priest.
And Erin ever was my song,
And often (after dinner-time)
I’ve told the tale of Erin's wrong, .
And bloody England's guilt and crime.
And pray’d a curse—as who would not?—
On them that holds the tyrant's rod–
That sent the fell potato-rot,
And persecutes the men of God.
And as I did my grief assuage,
And, sobbing, told my country's fate,
M} audience wept with honest º
heir gentle bosoms thrill'd wit hate.
Yes, lovely France is Erin's friend;
And from Marseilles to Finisterre,
(I seen the land from end to end)
By all the blessed Saints I swear,
There’s not a man in lovely France—
That peaceful land, so full of charms,
With billions of inhabitants,
All bold in war, and bred to arms—
There is not, from Burdeaux to Par’s,

But does the bloody #. ish curse.
There’s not a lovely maid or wife,
Orlady there of any note,
But she would take a carving-knife,

As sure as I’m a man of God,

A QUESTION OF STALE EGGS.
MonTHs, in these rapid times, become centuries, and therefore we
may ask, as a question of archaeological interest, what has become of
the Oobali? The Qobali were certain persons, or, to speak more
correctly, a set of fellows, whose name is derived from the Greek words
dºw an egg, and 8&Aw to throw, by reason of their having distinguished
themselves by throwing foul eggs at people in returning from the Qaks,
last Epsom races. One of their number, it was understood, was to have
been tried for this outrage at the Old Bailey—but the trial has not yet
taken place. We repeat, then, what has become of the egg-throwers?
for, as their offence was not only filthy in itself, but followed by conduct
of equally disgusting baseness, they ought by this time to be all of
them at work picking oakum.
Not Going, but Gone.
THE papers stated, that during the LoRD MAYOR's late, visit to
Paris he had arranged to sell by auction many of the French articles
in the Crystal Palace. We tºld not believe that his Lordship so far
combined business with pleasure, as to make his visit the medium of a
job, or that he would knock down with the hammer of the auctioneer
the whole of his civic dignity. It so happens, moreover, that his Lord-
ship has retired from the rostrum, as the advertisements of “
GADSDEN, (late Musgrove and, GADSDEN)” will testify, and he
accordingly has ceased to put anything up, but his brother Aldermen.

THE WASTATOR EPIscopus—on, THE BLIGHT of THE SHAMRock—(MAY BE
sEEN witHouT THE AID of A MICRoscope).
THE Episcopus Wastator—some specimens of which have been lately exhibited in
Parliament—is a variety of the Moth, tribe, and is peculiarly remarkable for the
º: which it does ſo the cloth. The creature º e caught sleeping on
the Episcopal bench. In size it sometimes exceeds the largest beadle. It often
commits great ravages on Church º; which it getshold of, and appropriates
to its own purposes, by the most crafty management. Such, is the voracity of the
Episcopus Pastator, that a iº, individual of the species will consume the fat of
the land to the value of £10,000, £15,000, £25,000, or even more, per annum. It
is a lepidopterous insect; the wings with which it flies away with its booty being
exposed. The head is defended by a whitish pileglum, presenting a cleft appearance:
the body is invested with a mantle of snowy hue: and a similar covering, but
of a finer texture, clothes the two anterior extremities, which terminate in claws
of great strength and tenacity: the two hinder or lower limbs, are black; as also
the whole body is found to be when its exterior investment has been removed. Its
throat is garnished with two white bands. It is furnished with ºntenna, or feelers,
which it sometimes puts forth during its periodical visitations. On these occasions,
it emits a peculiar hum; whence, among the vulgar, it has obtained the name of
Hum-Bug. Another variety of the Episcopus Mastator is met with here, but is
more numerous in some foreign parts. It is distinguished by the peculiar brilliancy
of its colours, which vary from gold and purple to scarlet, exceeding in splendour
those of a shiny beetle. Ireland it is common; and is one of the principal causes
of the blight which prevails in that country. It is less voracious, perhaps, than the
other Episcopus; but is even more mischievous: for it is
armed with a sting, and its habits are analogous to those
of the gad-fly and the hornet.
The Episcopus Pastator must not be confounded with
the Episcopus Pastor, or true Episcopus, which it resembles
in nothing but external appearance.
EXCITING RACE.
The American “Liners” are, undoubtedly, very fast
vessels, but we think that we know a class here able to go
a-head of them—we mean our own newspaper “liners,”
who are capable of lengths to which most objects in crea-
tion are unequal. During the whole of the recent yacht-
ing at Cowes, our “liners” have been going the pace, and
showing that their craft are undoubtedly more than a match
for the craft now in the Channel: so intensely nautical have
the worthy fellows become, that common comprehension is
incapable of keeping up with them. ... We used to think that
fire was the natural element of the liner, but he now shows
himself equally at home in water, which, for that matter,
is equally, to be sure, a devouring element. Let us hope
that it won’t be necessary to interdict him from both fire
and water—as the Romans were wont to do by those whom
they declared enemies to the republic.
What can be more ludicrous than to see the liner run-
ning a race with the sailor, and becoming more nautical
than the nautical themselves? to have honest WILLBLUgsby
informing us that the Screamer “hauled her wind,” while
the Poppet “wore at two,” and “with gaff-topsail shiver-
ing,” got the “wind on her quarter?” hen we find him
holding forth on the fact, that the Titania lost way,”
on a certain occasion, it only leads to the reflection, that
#: *: is losing his way in a subject for which he is not
ted.
PROFEssoR AquaRIUs BRICK, the accomplished lecturer,
who has, of course, been at Cowes during the recent cruises
has written to us, severely stigmatising the assumption of
nautical airs by everybody. . He makes our blood run cold
by informing us that an old stager, recently paid off from
the West Indies, who ventured to make a remark on the
America, was told by young Gosling (of the firm of Flore
AND Gosling) that “no square-rigged man could sºil
a fore-and-after!”
Good News for the Nostrils.
THE other morning, at the first General Court of Com-
missioners of Sewers held under the recent act of Parlia-
ment, MR. E. Lawes, the lately constituted chairman of the
Commission, said–according to the Times, that
“He would take that opportunity of stating, that he should give
his personal attendance at that office every day.”
“A new broom sweeps clean,” declares the adage. Now
that MR, LAwes has been appointed to preside over our
sewers, may this proverb be exemplified in the state of the
Metropolis.
Hagiology in 1851.
It is the boast of Popish controvertists, that all the
saints exclusively belong to their persuasion; which is so
far true that no other sect at present pretends to make any.
Rome, however, continues to do so occasionally; and the
political line taken by her priesthood in Ireland renders
it highly probable that—as Assizes are still among the
institutions of the country—the Papal Church, although it
may fail to augment the army of martyrs, will soon afford
some additions to the Calendar.
Don't Run for Gold.
The latest intelligence from California seems to show that
the golden age is by no means, the most virtuous, for
incendiarism, robbery, and murder are every-day occur-
rences. As the ordinary tribunals cannot keep pace with
the extraordinary amount of crime, the inhabitants have
established Lynch law; but it is a bad symptom when it is
only by the use of a Lynch pin such as this, that the
common wheel is kept in regular motion.

THE IRON DUKE AT THE IRON BRIDGE.
O—THE DUKE has

— the Britannia

mained,” says the
reporter, “for some
time in one parti-
cular spot, and ap-

in his thoughts.” A
very natural cause
of meditation. The
iron soldier was con-

BRITISH DERWISHES.
A FEw years ago there was produced at one of the theatres a sort of
º performance, with music by BEETHoveN, called The Ruins of
thens. One feature in the performance was the celebration of
Mahometan service by a band of dancing dervishes, whose worship
consisted in spinning round upon their heels till they were giddy–
*. in the meanwhile a frantic chorus of Kaala / Kaaba /
rom that time to this, Kaaba / Kaaba / has not been performed on
the stage; but something very like it has been repeated elsewhere, and
continues to be, according to the subjoined statement of the Times—
though this Kaaba seems taken, not from The Ruins of Athens, but from
the Ruins of Rome:—
“THE ARCHBrºhop of CANTERBURY AND THE High CHURCH PARTY.—The ARCH-
make
Bishop of CANTERBURY has, for some time past, been in communication with several
clergymen in his diocese, in reference to the manner in which they are in the habit of
conducting the ordinary services of the Church. It appears that the clergymen alluded
to, practise many of the ceremonies for which the Bishop of London recently con-
demned MR. BennETT; such, for example, as having lights on the altar during morning
prayer, preaching in the surplice, intoning the prayers, and turning from the congre-
gation during certain portions of the service.” -
But our British Dervishes do things by halves; they turn only half
round. Why don't º go the whole hog, and regularly waltz, and
sing Kaabaſ instead of burlesquing something else, by intoning it?
And in spinning and pirouetting while they are about it, it would be all
the better if these reverend mountebanks would dance themselves out
of the Church.
IAL PATRIOTS.
ERTAINLY if ever the country should
want to be saved, we suppose
we must look for our patriots—if
their own account of themselves
is to be believed—in the vestries
of the Metropolis. Judging from
the estimate they form of their
own importance, in a national
point of view, the Cockney yestry-
men are the only champions of
our liberties, and we must go to
Pancras for our PyMs—should
we ever require one–or to
Hampstead for our HAMPDEN,
If this empire were one great
metropolitan parish, we might
perhaps entrust its destinies to
the noisy orators in the º:
bourhood of the New Road—
though we should feel some re-
luctance in doing so; but as long
as things, remain as, they are,
we protest against the Westry
Rooms of Marylebone and St. Pancras aping to themselves all the
airs, and affecting to deal with all the business, of the Houses of
Lords and Commons. The “debates,” as given, in the columns of a
Sunday contemporary, are racy specimens of British eloquence, and
British grammar, and the disagreements between the members them-
selves are no less striking than the want of agreement between their
verbs and their substantives.
One of the strongest weapons that could be used by a foe to the
system of self-government is put into his hands by the fact, that the
metropolitan rate-payers will entrust their interests to a set of gar-
rulous simpletons, who meet to talk about everything, and, as an almost
inevitable consequence, to do scarcely anything...The headings of the
subjects discussed might be mistaken usually for the titles ºf the topics
à. within Parliament, while the bickerings of the members are dis-
tinguished by nothing but perhaps their extra coarseness from, the
altercations between real Members of Parliament. Scarcely, a debate
takes place at a metropolitan vestry, in the course of which some
honourable member does not “fling the dastardly lie backinsome other
honourable member's teeth,” and in which somebody, does, not call
somebody else a renegade and a traitor, for having left the Blues, and
attached himself to the tail of the Greens, for some sinister purpose.
Hardly an orator rises to give his opinion on the proper allowange of
gruel for paupers, but he thinks it necessary to dilate on the evils of
state pauperism, and express a patriotic wish that he had the privilege
of administering their gruel to that class, of mendicants. Qccasionally
a Pancratian patriot, in denouncing the evils of superfluity, in the
allowance of tea to aged inmates, will have an oratorical fling, at super-
fluities in general, in which he will probably mingle together the House
of Lords, the Rector's income, the salaries of all public, functionaries
above five hundred a year, and a few other matters of a kindred kind,
as being all equally superfluous. We have not the slightest doubt that
if an offer were to be made to any of these metropolitan vestries to
combine the whole of the public business, with their own, the task
would be eagerly undertaken by a large majority of those exceedingly
self-sufficient, but otherwise inefficient, bodies.
We have no doubt that most of them mean well enough; but
labouring, as they do, under the effects of that most fearful compound,
excessive ignorance mingled with excessive conceit, they become guilty
of those absurdities which have the dangerous tendency of bringing
local self-government into contempt and ridicule. The ratepayers of
the Metropolis ought really to stir themselves, and send to the vestries
men who will do the business that it is really their duty to perform, and
leave state matters for discussion, in other places, and on other
occasions. We do not deprecate public discussion, by any means; but
a body appointed to do one thing, should not always be discussing some
other. †. vestrymen of Marylebone and Pancras should stick to their
parochial affairs, instead of hurling back the lie in each other's teeth,
casting defiance in the face of Lond JoHN, and throwing down—that
miserable piece of patriotic property—the “gauntlet” at everything
and everybody. We should be glad to see among the curiosities at the
British Museum the “gauntlet” that the metropolitan vestrymen are
always taking up and throwing down again.

OLD ENGLISH BULL-BEEF.
AGENTLEMAN, named GREENHow, an advocate of Protection, writing

“They have laid aside every true and independent English feeling, and have pan-
dered to the selfish and grasping spirit of a very small minority."
Of the same body, in the same paragraph of the same letter, the same
gentleman complains, that
“They have, by the vague, visionary, and captivating theory of “free trade,’
enchanted the unthinking part of our community (unfortunately much the larger
rtion), who, carried away by the irresistible influence of this spell, have heedlessly
!. in the cry to destroy everything British, in order to advance and elevate the
alien.’
What with pandering to the spirit of “a very small minority,” and also
enchanting “much the larger portion of the community,” the Legislature
must have gone a very considerable way towards º everybody.
If MR. GREENHow were a Papist, and would hold forth at the
Rotunda, he might outshine Messrs. REYNoLDs, Keogh, MooRE, and
Company, on their own ground. But with all due deference to the
Protectionists, the necessity for importing foreign cattle is, in no
measure, disproved by the exhibition, however large, of this splendid

FIGHT FOR CUBAN FREEDOM.
UST now American views of
Cuban affairs are very contra-
dictory. According to recent
Transatlantic news at a “mass
meeting” of 18,000 persons
held at New York, to sympa-
thise with the Cuban invaders,
it was resolved, amid tremen-
dous enthusiasm,
“That in the opinion of this meet-
ing it is consistent with the peace,
neutrality, and honour of our Govern-
ment for the people to assemble to-
gether, and express their sentiments
upon the subject of Cuban independ-
ence; that such an expression not
only comports with the magnanimity
and feelings of a free people, but is
more particularly honourable to the
character of a nation who were the
first to declare and establish the prin-
ciples of freedom.”
Also,
“That our Cuban brethren . .
have proved themselves not unworthy
of the liberty which our example has
taught them to long for.”
Likewise,
“That the appeals so frequently
made by the downtrodden inhabitants
of Cuba for aid and assistance in the
holy cause in which they are engaged
are worthy of being responded to by
the American people.”
- Now, “MR. AsHBEL SMITH,
in a letter to the Times concerning the movement in Cuba, thus writeth:—
of Texas,”
“The main cause of the Cuban movement is the uncertainty of their property, and the insecurity of their
social and political condition, and even of their lives, arising from the mischievous intermeddling of British
abolitionists with THE SLAVE INSTITUTIONs of CUBA."
And thus:-
“It is a conviction of the truth of this charge of intermeddling that has roused the sympathy and enlisted the
co-operation of numerous American citizens.”
So the “mass meeting” at New York sympathises with the Cuban revolutionists because
they assert “the principles of freedom,” because they have proved themselves not unworthy
of “liberty,” and because they were “downtrodden,” and engaged in a “holy cause”—the
cause of that same liberty.
Not a bit of it, says—or seems to say—AsHBEL SMITH, of Texas. The Cuban movement,
and the sympathy of American citizens therewith, has been occasioned by the attempts of
certain officious Britishers to procure, in Cuba, the abolition of slavery.
Further declareth doughty AshBEL SMITH, on behalf of his compatriots:—
“Nor will we suffer the institutions of Cuba to be destroyed by secret fraud or by open violence. The
attempt to do so by the first means is the true cause and origin of the present convulsion in Cuba.”
He has already explained that the institutions he means are slave institutions, and these
he declares his countrymen will defend; whilst sympathising as well as himself with the
Cuban insurgents, they profess to be actuated by a zeal for freedom. -
Can the large intermixture of Irish with Yankee blood, which has been occasioned by
emigration lately, at all account for this confusion of American ideas? -
One fact seems certain. The “sympathy” of the Americans is most eloquently repudiated
by those i. the inhabitants of Cuba who are most interested in the “holy cause” of
liberty. Four hundred and fifty gentlemen, zealous for Cuban freedom—the model freedom
of American citizenship—headed by GENERAL Lopez, and Colonels PRAGAY and CLEN-
DINNIN, landed near Cabanos, had a battle with the Spanish troops, were beaten, and some
fifty of them captured. Having ; to war on their own account, unsanctioned by their
Government, from no motive intelligible to their captors, but the desire of pay or of plunder;
the prisoners were—not unnaturally, though rather severely –treated as brigands taken red-
handed, and forthwith shot. And then—but let the New York Herald conclude the tale:
“After they were shot they were dragged by the feet by negroes, who commenced stripping them of their
clothes, which they carried on sticks through the streets, yelling like so many wild demons.”
Very horrid this; barbarous; disgusting; revolting. The atrocity, however, on the part
of the negroes, clearly shows that the Cuban slaves have rather a strong detestation than
any love of the propagandists of Yankee freedom. Strange—is it not?—that they should
evince such savage, furious hostility to the “holy cause.”
A Real Nut to Crack.
MR, DUNUP has, in order to encourage ingenuity, resolved on offering a very handsome
reward to any one who will pick his pocket so effectually as to get anything out of it. The
learned gentleman states, fairly enough, that he has tried the experiment frequently on his
own pocket, and has never yet succeeded; but, that if any, one else should prove more
fortunate, he will be most happy to share the produce with the lucky individual. The profes-
sional pickpockets have, it is understood, long ago abandoned the hopeless task, so that
amateurs have now a fair opportunity.
A CHALLENGE TO MR. HOBBS.

BRAMAH's Lock with twenty tumblers!
“This was done in the day-time. Can he do

“I don’t wish to boast, old Punch, but I

Coal Hole, or Cider Cellars, of opening a lock—
a patent CHUBB-with at least 25, Tumblers!—
Tumblers of Gin-and-Water l—hot |! mind you
—and this I have done, not with a set of instru-
ments, but with a simple latch-key! and I am
proud to say, my hand has never failed me once!
“Now, my dear Boy, if MR. HoBBs will under-

I will promise to pay him the £500–or the £50–
or the box of cigars—or the dinner for a dozen
—or the anything he pleases—in the event of
his being the winner, which I doubt very strongly;
for very few men, I flatter myself, are equal to
the task of opening a lock with five-and-twenty
tumblers of hot gin-and-water |
“This is a fair challenge. In proof of which
I have the pleasure of subscribing myself, to the
extent of three-pence every week,
“Your constant admirer,

An Old Fogey's Grumble.
Most things that are to be bought are obtain-

rience, which, as a young man buys it, he must
pay ready money for it. This may be one reason,
perhaps, why the young men of the present day
show themselves possessed of such very little
experience. They spend their money in other
things, and refuse to buy the only thing worth
paying for. But only let a shop be opened
to-morrow, where Experience could be had upon
credit, and the doors would be blocked up by the
crowds of young men rushing to buy it!

THE Pope and KING BoMBA are linked together by a tie of the closest

the iron fetters which link together the political victims of that amiable

THE HOLY WELL STREET CRUSADE.
THE spasmodic morality of a parish is pleasant to consider. How
long will a St. Molly-le-Strand, or St. Bacon-cum-Beans mod, absolutely
snore, over the most fetid, crying nuisance, as though the aforesaid
St. Molly or St. Bacon slept on roses, fulled by silver brooks. Here
has Holywell Street been a long-lived abomination; sinners there
have grown grey in their nastiness; nevertheless, the filth has been
respected by the authorities as though it were a vested interest, and
moral atrocity an allowed marketable commodity. In Holywell Street
Infamy took up its freedom, and was a protected citizen, And now,
housewives taken with an annual fit of cleanliness, and resolved to 1-
whitewash the house from top to bottom, are not more emergetic in
their niceness, than are, the parish authorities with Holywell Street,
suddenly discovered and denounced . The housewife takes her bed-
stead to bits, and sulphurs it, and soaks it, and kills the very larvae of
the noisome abominations. In like manner Parish Authority now
resolves to take to bits the infested Holywell Street. Well, there may
be bedsteads that fire alone can purify; and there may be some streets
tº-well there may be some streets that may be very like some
steads.

race, if she is made to feel in her turn the smartness of America's
Rigging.

I’m hungry, and often in want of a meal;
So, of course, Imust work, or beg, borrow, or steal.
But work there’s no getting, for none will employ
A shoeless and º vagabond boy.
I meet with companions,—there’s PENTONVILLE Bob
Good-naturedly offers to give me a job.
Says he—“There's the pawnbroker's, over the way;”
Take the coat from outside—there’ll be nothing to pay”.
I do as he bidsme; he tellsme, with joy,
He’s glad to have found such a promising boy.
And as without money I buy things so well
He thinks I shall make a good hand at a sell.
So he takes me at once to a kind-hearted gent,
With a beard rather black, and a nose very ben
Who gives me a shilling, and calls me “good lad,”
And asks if there ain’t any more to be had.*
The game I continue, with this thing and that;
To-day it’s some boots, and to-morrow a hat:
Though less I keep º for each thing that goes
To the gent with the beard and the bend in the nose.
The game it goes on, every day after day;
But more gets the trouble, and less gets the pay:
That it comes, very soon, as a pleasant relief,
To be sent for three months as a juvenile thief.
When turn'd out of prison—the season is cold-
Of a School for the Ragged Isomehow get told.
I think that I’ll go there;—if nothing Igain,
At least I’m kept out of the wind and the rain.
At first when I go there I’m ready to laugh;
I turn off the gas, and the teachers I chaff;
But as nothing their temper appears to provoke,
I very soon find there’s an end to the #.
The lessons they teach me, I try and repeat,
But my want, as I tell them, is something to eat.
They ask if I’ll work; I answer—“Of course;
If I’m fed like a Christian, I’ll work like a horse.”
So they give me a box, and of brushes a set,
And a bottle of WARREN's superior jet,
And start me in life in the polishing trade,
By which, ever since, a good living I’ve made.
And often my memory carries me bac
Comparing myself to the shoe that Iblack;
I think how the dirt might have stuck to me still,
…” For want of a little hard work and good will.
So, honour to those who are on the alert ..
To raise up poor fellows like us from the dirt,
And cause all the rubbings through which we have past
To end, like this boot, in a polish at last.
There is nothing so black, but, if r. we bestow,
With something like sunshine will speedily glow;
And, though deep in the mud, if exertion we use,
We may walk, very soon, in respectable shoes.
The Neapolitan Flag.
THE British fleet have arrived off Palermo. The Queen “saluted the
Neapolitan flag.” This, of course, is mere routine courtesy. But the
Neapolitan flag." As the pestilent rag at present taints the air, how
ought the atrocious bit of bunting to be “saluted?” What would be
* rightful salutation? The clank of chains, and the yell of, the
gman.
A Thought.—Imitation is the homage which Mediocrity pays to
Superiority.

THE POPE ALL SMOKE.
º
HERE there is smoke, there
= must befire.” So runs the
proverb; and the Pope—
it would seem—inclines an
ear to proverbial philo-
sophy. No smoke-no fire.
The Romans have ceased
to smoke; ergo, religion has
died in their hearts: the
true faith is spat from their mouths with
the last end of the last cigar. Butawhile
since, the Roman could notaway without
tobacco: inits leaf was his whole catholic
duty of man. Then, taking thought
that the weed was a precious burnt
offering to the exchequer of his Holi-
ness, the Roman flung it hence, patrioti-
cally setting his teeth against renewe
temptation. Quenched, extinct is state
tobacco-
*The breath of heav'n has blown its spirit out,
And strewed repentant ashes on its head.”
A serious meani ento a solemn
Pope—lies in that inch of charred to-
bacco, the waif of a Roman highway.
Infallibility, like a Paris º: may
stoop to the thing; but, unlike the man
of mud, may find a moral value in that
burnt weed’s-end. For when patriotism
cries “No smoke,”—then to a three-
crowned Holiness, may leaves of tobacco
be leaves of the Sibyl. Even in such small rejected fronds is written revolution. -
Let the Pope have due credit for his sagacity—his foresight. Unsmoked tobacco is not
lost ºpºn him. The Vatican is in dismay; for men breathe no tobacco clouds. The cryis
not, “the sacred chickens will not eat; ” but deeper, louder the wail, for-the Romans will
not smoke.” Now, certes, without smoke, there can be no fire; and least of all, without such
smoke, that en fire that—stolen, or taxed, or both—informs and animates the heart and
brain of the Roman government. - -
Sadly, indeed—as we gather from Rome—does the Pope take this obstinate temperance of
is once brave “tobacco-boys.” Had we the heart to dally with the state distresses of an
Infallible, we might picture the Pope aloft in his chamber, taking a vain sniff of Roman
atmosphere; in that sniff faintly hoping a pleasure of hope.
*— and his broad nostrils wide upturn'd;
Scented the “Roman' air."
No: not a leaf is burned in the street to the profit of his Holiness: quenched, and cold is
the altar of his Exchequer. And now the Pope cannot see his way for want of smoke.
Nevertheless, something must be done. Tobacco, being a government commodity, is sacred
to state purposes.
Assuredly—says the good Pope—we have discovered that the people are the breath of our
nostrils; for we only live while the people smoke. Not to smoke is, therefore, to conspire
against our vitality. In the time of witchcraft—a time all but brought back by the accursed
republicans—men were consumed in their living flesh, as their small waxen effigies melted
before the fire. With different means, sinners would, in our person, compass the like atrocity.
Our state is tobacco! our chair tobacco! I, your father, am tobacco-I, the Pope. And you
will spit us from your mouths! No, my children: rather you w hip us, as in the good
old time—worship us with fiscal incense, and in treasury clouds
But the Pope—a wiser man since his travels—resolves to wor icotian backsliders by
the force of example. He makes smoke a test of right of office.Tſe who eats the loaves
and fishes of the Vatican shall no longer eat unless he smoke. Nay, he shall, smoke abun-
dantly; putting all his heart, as well as all his lungs, in smoke. This is soberly true. The
order has gone forth. All who heretofore smoked, are now to smoke with greater zeal; and
they who never smoked before, are to give their qualms to the winds, and are immediately to
learn to live in clouds.
Who knows? The English Cabinet may, in some future day of trouble, take counsel of
this last doing of the Pope. Last week only, the QUEEN, through her minister, acknowledged
the receipt of the address voted by certain Temperance societies; all passively opposing the
revenue...In some time of trouble—may it be cycles distant!—the great body of the º:
for a political purpose, may renounce wine and spirits, as the Romans now close their lips
º: tobacco. Then may the ruler of these realms remember the wisdom of SAINT Pius–
(for he will no doubt be canonised by then)—and compel all ministers, and clerks, and all the
army and the navy to drink double of all strong drinks. The behest may bear hardly upon
the officials of that time; and may they be spared the trial Nevertheless, Pius THE NINTH
makes the experiment historically practicable.
To be sure, the Pope has at his hand thousands of men able, and no doubt willing, to
me tobacco-teachers; we mean the meek, unclouded priesthood. Pretty, to contemplate
the Roman youth, conning its first tobacco-leaf under the monk-master. To teach the young
idea how to smoke! And as the priests of Naples have published a new Political Catechism,
the purpose of which is to deify a King of Bomb-Shells—why may not the Roman youth be
exercised with a Dialogue on Tobacco, for the glory and profit of a Pope of Smoke? Some-
thing after this fashion:
algonquerit.
Q: What is tobacco º
4. Tobacco is a leaf from the only lawful Tree
of Knowledge.
Q. For what was tobacco created?
4. It was created to be burnt to the honour
and º and profit of the Pope—tobacco being
to his Holiness what myrrh and frankincense
were to Solomon.
Q. How do you best honour your Father, the
Pope? - - -
4. By thinking him tobacco–still tobacco–
and always tobacco.
Q. And how do you show yourself a true son
of his Holiness?
. A. By continually putting his Holiness (which
is tobacco) in my pipe, and smoking him.
This is but a sample, and slipshod enough.
Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that, at the
present...moment, tobacco being his Holiness’s
great difficulty, he is taking strong measures to
All his friends must smoke. Pipes
for the Roman Government. The Pope's true
circle is the spittoon.
THE LAST APPENDIX TO “YANKEE
DOODLE”.
YANKEEDoonLE sent to Town
His goods for exhibition;
Everybody ran him down,
And laugh’d at his position:
They thought him all the world behind;
Agoney, muff, or noodle;
Laugh on good people—never mind—
Says quiet Yankee Doople.
Chorus-YANREE DooDLE, &c.
YANKEE Doople had a craft,
A rather tidy clipper,
And he challenged, while they laughed,
The Britishers to whip her.
Their whole yacht-squadron she outsped,
And that on their own water;
Of all the lot she went a-head,
And they came nowhere arter.
Chorus-YANKEE DooDLE, &c.
O'er Panama there was a scheme
Long talk'd of, to pursue a
Short route—which many thought adream—
By lake Nicaragua.
John Bull discussed the plan on foot,
With slow irresolution,
While YANKEE DooDLE went and put
It into execution.
Chorus-YANKEE DooDLE, &c.
A steamer of the Collins line,
A YANKEE Doople's motion,
Has also quickest cut the brine
Across the Atlantic Ocean.
And British agents, noways slow
Her merits to discover,
Have been and º: her—just to tow
The CUNARD packets over.
Chorus.-YANKEE DooDLE, &c.
Your gunsmiths of their skill may crack,
But that again don't mention;
I guess that Colts' revolvers whack
Their very first invention.
By YANKEE DooDLE, too, you're beat
Downright in Agriculture,
With his machine for reaping wheat,
Chaw’d up as by a vulture.
Chorus.-YANKEE DooDLE, &c.
You also fancied, in your pride,
Which truly is tarnation,
Them British locks of yourn defied
The rogues of all creation;
But Chubbs' and BRAMAH's Hobbs has pick’d,
And you must now be view’d all
As having been completely licked
By glorious Yankee Doople.
Chorus-Yankee Doople, &c.

THINGS LEFT BEBIND IN THE EXHIBITION.
THE list of things left behind in the Exhibition would really make a
very curious little exhibition of themselves, and we would, therefore,
propose that the police may be permitted to open, for their own benefit,
this extraordinary cabinet of curiosities. The ladies, in E.; have
shown a singular amount of forgetfulness; one, in her absence of mind,
having left her petticoat, in the building; and another, having gone,
not leaving her bustle behind her in its usual place, but having actually
allowed it to remain in the Crystal Palace. Parasols, victorines, cuffs,
and children, have been picked up in large numbers by the police; and,
indeed, there have been so many boys and girls found in the building,
that there is some reason to doubt º -
been selected as a convenient spot for i.º.º. It was perhaps
considered that the infants thus abandoned would become, as it were,
wards of the Commissioners, and get supported out of the surplus.
Two ladies left their pockets; and the police also found a spirit-flask,
which, of course, belonged to one of them. Those who are curious as
to female carelessness may, at any time, pick up a great deal off the
floor of the Exhibition.
WHY DID THE “AMERICA.” BEAT US?
As numbers of our contemporaries have given accounts, more or less
scientific, of the build of the America yacht, and the causes of her
superiority to our own vessels, we have the pleasure of laying before
our nautical readers the following letter of CAPTAIN NELson Colling-
wood SAINT WINCENT SMITH, of the Royal Navy, with whose reputa-
tion for gallantry, as well as for science, every person is acquainted:-
“MY DEAR ADMIRAL, Sheerness, September 6, 1851.
“That the Yankee has beaten us is perfectly clear. I have
never seen a more complete beating since the day when on board the
old Borysthenes we took the Maravedi, 74, in Tapioca Bay. Neither of
us, nor any of the survivors, are likely to forget that day. . The next
best thing to conquering we have done on this occasion-we have taken
our thras j with perfect good-humour. No men were ever whapped
who bore so little malice as the Cowes gentlemen.
ether the Crystal Palace has not j
... “But I suppose they don't intend to be thrashed again. Sameness
}; as they say.—Let us see how to prevent this sameness for the
wture.
“I have gone over every inch of the America from athwart her
hause to the utmost shiver of her timbers. You have but to compare
her gannets and trunnions with those in use by our shipbuilders, and to see
what an immense advantage in a 6-knot breeze, at §.S. by S., she must
have. Her clewlines are 28 feet by 11, while ours are of the ordinary
register of 13 to the dozen. Any schooner so rigged (let alone cutters)
must clear the water-line with her log, and so get an advantage of a
common buffer-rigged, boat, whatever may be the pressure of her
scuppers. . The old Catawampus was so constructed; it was notorious
every dockyard in the QUEEN’s dominions, that this build was the
e possible in a trade-wind; and of course, in consequence, it was
out by the Admiralty. It wouldn't suit the patronage of my
to build vessels like the Catawampus.
“Look at our halyards, and then go and look at the America's
spanker-boom! Our gaffs are brass: whilst hers are india-rubber.
Every inch of canvas in her cuddy is as taut as a deal-table: to reef
the commonest caboose in an English yacht takes 79 seconds, whilst
her parabola is never calculated under an hour. -
“How could we expect, under such circumstances, that the issue
should have been otherwise than as it turned out?
“Always, my dear Admiral, truly yours,
*Neison Collingwoop Sºnſ' Vincent SMITH.”
Annexation.
THE American “Liberators,” who have failed in Cuba, are most
respectfully and earnestly requested to annex an island lying off the
American coast, called Ireland.

WHO'LL BUY OUR INDULGENCESP
UNCH intends to open a shop for the Sale of
Indulgences. It is a good profitable busi-
ness, and we do not see why the Pope
should have the monopoly of it. The pro-
ceeds of the sale we intend, 'of course, to
devote to some good purpose. It will be
the purchase of a handsome estate—or
perhaps we may build a yacht with it, for
the purpose of beating the America. How-
ever, there will be no difficulty in spending
the money. The first consideration is to
get it, and when once we have got it, we
will pledge our words of honour that every
farthing of it shall be *. For fear of
any misunderstanding, however, we beg
most º to state that the very last
purpose to which the money is likely to be
app ied, will be—a Cathedralſ
This is the plan of Sale, which, after
mature consideration, we have determined
upon, as the one most conducive to our benefit.
For every husband who takes his wife to the sea-side, or abroad, we
will grant an Indulgence of domestic peace for the period he is absent
from home during his wife's pleasure. -
To every Minister and Member of Parliament, who has worked hard
during the Session, we will award an Indulgence of grouse-shooting as
soon as the Session is over. -
To every Lawyer who is homest, and to every Barrister who pleads
for the love of truth and not the love of money, we will grant an
Indulgence of a trip on the Continent during the Long Vacation.
To every Cabman, who does not charge a Foreigner more than twice
his fare, we will award an Indulgence of fourpence in every shilling.
To every lazy Schoolboy, who is born with a talent for getting
into mischief, we will grant an Indulgence of , at least six weeks
º of flogging—that is to say, providing his holidays continue
as Iong.
To every old maid, who abstains from scandal at a tea-party, we
will present the Indulgence of the strongest cup of tea.
To every gentleman, who gives himself the trouble of exposing the
impositions of cabmen and omnibus conductors, we will promise the
Indulgence of finding a policeman on all the occasions he will be in
want of one. -
To every lady who buys a copy of Punch on crossing the Channel,
we will, graciously award, as a special Indulgence, our most fervent
hopes that she may not be yisited with sea-sickness, or detained more
than two hours at any English Custom-house.
The above Indulgences will be sold at the most moderate rate, at
No. 85, Fleet Street. The sale, we expect, will be something enormous;
and the proceeds we intend to devote, as we have honestly said, entirely
to our own benefit. If the English people are foolish enough to bu
Indulgences—and when a humbug is started, we think the English
people are foolish enough for anything—we do not see why we should
not reap the advantage of it as well as the Pope, or CARDINAL WISE-
MAN, or MR. PUGIN, or any one else. So, with all our lungs, we cry,
“Who'll buy—buy—buy—our fine Indulgences?”
PEACE FOR IRELAND. º
FoR the quadrature of the circle—pardon | We mean for the pağ.
fication of Ireland, a correspondent has sent us a very good suggestion.
The Irish, he says, are continually abusing and opposing the Goyern-
ment under which they live, and as constantly extolling that of the
Pope of Rome, and yearning for subjection to the papal despotism,
The Romans, on the other hand, he observes, are equally hostile to
the dominion of their Pontiff, and as anxiously desirous of a consti.
tutional government. These undutiful children of the “Holy Father,”
turned their poor Papa out of doors the other day, and would repeat
the deed, were it in their power. Just so would the sons of Erin, if
tº: could, expel their Sassenach tyrants and oppressors.
e therefore proposes that—with the consent of the respective
parties, which would be a matter of course—HER MAJESTY should
tºº. her Irish lieges with the Pope, for the temporal subjects of
oliness.
This proposal looks very feasible. In addition to the pleasure of D
wearing the “sweet yoke of Rome.”—Inquisition and all—and of seeing
others who hate it obliged to wear it too—there would be that of
º the warmth of sunny Italy; which, to a considerable portion
of the Hibernian º would be the greatest in life. Said sunn
Italy is much too hot to hold the Romans, for whose constitution the air
of Ireland would be considerably more suitable. . The QUEEN would
acquire subjects who would be too happy to enjoy free institutions.
~- -
The Pope would gain vassals who would rejoice in kissing his shoes.
What arrangement could be more convenient for QUEEN, Pope, PADDY,
and the Roman people?
But, recollect, there is a large proportion-much larger than is com-
monly supposed—of Irishmen, who are no Papists; and the noise that
is made by the Pope's brass band is no criterion of the numbers of the
enemy's troops.
Moreover, it is a question, whether, if we wished to subvert the
F. power in Ireland, the P. plan, would not be to establish
opery there; and whether, if Irishmen became the lawful subjects of
the Pope, their most violent Papists would not all turn Protestants.
A NEW MINE FOR THE PENNY-A-LINERS.
THE penny-a-liners have long ago exhausted the monstrosities of
the gooseberry, the precocities of the and the other freaks in
which Nature has sometimes indulged for the purpose, apparently, of
supplying the newspapers with paragraphs. Starvation seemed staring
them in the face, when an ingenious member of the fraternity has
happily hit upon an idea, of which the following extract furnishes an
illustration:
“Colonel — of —, now in his 86th year, on Tuesday week was’ out with his
gun and dog, and after five hours sport returned home to dinner, with seven and a half
brace of grouse in his game-bag, all shot by himself."
Here is sixpenn'orth for the penny-a-liner from an entirely new
source; and we have no doubt we shall have a large crop of venerable
or late colonels to supply the deficiency in the harvest of early peas or
monster gooseberries. łr. public may expect the above specimen to
be followed by a glut of admirals of 106, having been on their legs for
27 hours at a stretch, and having bagged their hundred head of game,
without having hoisted a signal of distress of any kind.
ST. LOUIS AND LOUIS NAPOLEON AT ROME.
IND Pope PIUs has paid an oblique
compliment to Louis NAPOLEON, the
President, through Louis THE
Twelfth, the Saint; whose fººte day
was on the 35th ult." The saint’s
festival was held with due pomp in
the Sacred College, the French Am-
bassador attending. We furtherlearn
that “a detachment of the 21st
Regiment of French Light Infantry,
with its band, occupied the nave of
the Church.” In the afternoon, the
Pope offered prayers in the chapel of
the holy monarch!
There is a significant delicacy in
the whole arrangement of the festival,
highly creditable to the Pope, and—
it cannot be otherwise—very flattering
to the President, whose saint's day
is marked with such especial favour...Very beautiful, too, the thought
that summoned “a detachment of the 21st Regiment of French Infantry”
to take part in the ceremony. They no doubt attended as repre-
sentatives of the whole French army'; and took-on the part of their
brotherhood in arms—an acknowledgment of that debt due to them
by the Pope, liſted back into his chair (at the best, by the way, an
uncomfortable hoist,) at the point of Gallic bayonets. , Delightful is
thankfulness in high places. A fourth crown is gratitude to a Pope!
Thus, his Holiness mixed thanksgiving incense, with French, gun-
powder; and —the band being present—with the praise of French
sanctity, did not forget French kettle-drums. It would be difficult to
show to a pure imagination, a more delightful, more º more
earnest picture than that of the aforesaid detachment of the 21st
French Infantry; upon whom, no doubt of it, SAINT Louis, on the
25th ult, was looking mistily down through seven centuries.
We earnestly trust that Louis the President, all the circumstances
considered, will take aspeculiarly complimentary to himself, the attention
nominally paid to Louis the Saint.

PUNCH'S ANNIVERSARIES.—No. 5, TEA FIRST INTRODUCED INTO ENGLAND, SEPTEMBER 2nd, 1666.
A CASE OF INGRATITUDE.
A PERson, by the name of John HENRY_NEwBoy, was brought up
before MR. ALDERMAN Moses, in Worship Street, charged by an old
lady with obstruction of her trade, and indecent and riotous behaviour.
The complainant, whose name is MRs. CHURCH, by trade a robe-
maker and haberdasher, is an old lady of great wealth and respectability,
and has a shop in Westminster, and another large shop in St. Paul's,
besides branch establishments in various parts of the country... John
HENRY had been in her service, and much trusted by her; till about
four years ago he left her business, and joined an opposition establish-
ment, kept by one MRs. HILLs, who has brought over a great number of
foreign workmen, and has set up an establishment for the sale of the
Babylonian Shirt, the Scarlet Chemise, the patent Haircloth ;
(which NEwBoy himself wears), the new thrashing-machine (for Englis
use) at the sign of the Winking Doll, in St. Mary Axe, with a great
number of branch houses in the country.
MRs. CHURCH came in such tribulation to the magistrate, that her
statements regarding NEwBoy were often quite incoherent. . She said
she had brought him up quite as a son of her own; had employed him
as a foreman in the robe-making, business, and set him up at Oxford,
(where the celebrated Oxford chºker had been of his invention ;) that
thousands of her shirts and chokers had been sold amongst the young
gentlemen of the University, and were worn in many of the genteelest
pulpits in London, until, a decree from the Ordinary against preaching
in shirts put an end to that practice—and reverend gentlemen now only
wore black robes. -
The worthy Alderman asked whether MRs. Church did not make
these too?
She said she did, and that she was robe-maker according to Act of
Parliament, and that her dresses were of the real original silk and cut,
and that none were genuine but hers;-on which NEwBoy cried out,
O venite / questo e un poco troppo forte—in the midst of a guffaw from
his friends, who were all silenced by the Court. -
“And,” continued MRs. CHURCH, with much volubility—“and if
something is not done, the robe making trade of Britain is ruined—
there are millions say there is no use in wearing robes at all; there’s
even Doctor LAMBETH that dares to say, that your common cheap
Geneva stuffs is as good as ours; and that there ain't two doctors in the
whole College as won't say as much—and there's this horrid old MoTHER
Hills has come over with her traps, and brings in pink shirts, and blue
shirts, and yellow shirts, and shirts embroidered with flowers.” And
finally MRs. Church begged from the worthy magistrate for protection
and for justice against New Boy.
ALDERMAN Moses said he could not see as yet in what Newboy had
. the law. There was a Free Trade in these, as in any other west-
menus.
One of the NEwBoy party here bellowed out in a strong Hibernian
accent—“Be dad, that’s not thrue—there’s a most intawlerable persecu-
tion against us by the beese, brutal, and bloody Whigs, and the sword of
the oppressor is at the troat of poor old suffering Oireland, which indig-
nantlee hurruled back the double-dyed malediction in the fiendish teet
of the toirant”—but the others begged FATHER MULLIGAN to be quiet.
“I do not see,” continued the Alderman, “how I can help you,
MRs. CHURCH. If a gentleman has a fancy to a Roman Camicci
instead of an English Shirt, with lawn sleeves, or not, how can
prevent him?”
“But,” said MRs. Church, “your worship can surely prevent him
calling me bad names, and making fun of me.”
“What is this Newboy f" asked the Magistrate.
º person addressed, a sly-looking man, with a look of great mischief,
Sald,
“My name is not Newboy.”
“Stuff!” said his worship; “a thousand men in Court know you,
Sir. I’ve seen you, myself, in Oxford—John HENRY NEwBoy.”
“My name is GIovaNNI ENRIco Nuovo FANCIULLo,” said the
other, meekly, and persisted in speaking all the time in Italian. “I
went by a name before, but I had no name. I was called Bachelor of
Divinity: but I was neither John HENRY: nor was I a divine, nor was
Ia bachelor: that is, I was a bachelor being a man, but not a bachelor,
being a divine, nor a divine being a bachelor: I could not form a part
of a whole which has no existence: and there being no whole, there is
no part. I could not be before I was born, or have a name before it
was given me. Having most undeniably had no name, I have a right
to assume that I was not. A gross material evidence, as of my person,
as of my bodily recollections, as of my having had a ſever, and taken
physic, as of my bills paid and docketted, &c., might lead me to infer
that I formerly was; but an undeniable logical conclusion shows me
that I was not. A man has a name; I had no name: therefore I was
not born. I have a name, therefore I am. Call me GiovaNNI
ENRIco Nuovo FANCIULL0, fottore.”
“Where do you live, Dottore?”

“At the sign of the Winking Doll in St. Mary Axe.”
“The Winking what?” asked the Bench. -
“The Winking Doll,” said the Doctor, meekly. “It is a known
fact that the blessed image winked at a cabstand, and converted the
whole stand, with the exception of the unbelieving waterman, And
though scepties have asserted that there were no cabs on the stand at
the time, and that the waterman who saw the sign, was intoxicated;
yet a waterman might be drunk, and there might be no cabs on the
stand: and a statue might wink—the latter proposition is quite
distinct from the former. Statues have been known to wink: statues
have been known to fly: statues have been known to swim; and to
talk like other blockheads. Our island is full of wonders, which come
down embalmed to us in tradition. On a peculiar emergency SAINT
Guy, the arithmetician, made two and two into five; SAINT WALKING-
HAM was in three places at once; SAINT FINNAN was in the habit of
reaching to the fish and the mermaids at the bottom of the sea;
AINT HoKIUs and SAINT PokIUs took refuge in a quart bottle when
rsecuted by the Druids, and being uncorked in presence of Swollo,
g of Little Britain, converted him, and his whole court. Why is
it more difficult to credit a marvel which happened yesterday, than to
believe a wonder which occurred thirteen hundred years ago?”
The magistrate said this had nothing to do with the complaint made
against NEwBoy, and begged MRs. CHURCH to state at once what was
her grievance.
The old lady complained that her late foreman was publishing libels
against her character, and against her shop: that he said her goods
were not genuine: that he was constantly talking against her, and
makin
†: whilst she was speaking, the complainant, NEwBoy, was
observed to laugh repeatedly and put his tongue in his mouth, and
handed round to his friends (a set of smug-looking people in black, with
heads, which looked as if they were afflicted with the ring-worm) a
caricature of old MRs. CHURCH, at which they all laughed. The old
lady's nose was trebled in this design, her corpulence was enormously
exaggerated, and her look (which has of late been a good deal puzzled
and bewildered) caricatured in the most ludicrous manner.
ALDHRMAN Moses checked this unseemly jocularity, and said, “MR.
NewBoy, it may suit you to make fun of old MRs. CHURCH; but you
will please to remember that there are other people besides her whom
some folks consider ridiculous; and I :*. that this tone of
levity does not become you towards an old lady who acted towards
ou as a mother. As for you, MRs. CHURCH, I don't see how I can
elp you: and you must remember that you have been calling MRs. |h
HIELs names your life, and very ugly names too. I’ve nothing to
do with the dispute between your shops; and can neither prevent
Mns. HILLs from selling her garments, or you from vending yours.”
A voice here, in the crowd, crying out, “Clo! Clo! ” in a jocular
tone, the worthy Alderman said, “Yes, if it is a question about clothes,
you know that our ople have the realoid clother-that we are unjustly
treated, and yet that we don’t complain: that we are º: and
that we don't threaten to rebel, or call foul names, or utter false.
oods, or incite to hatred and fury against those who do us wrong.”
And, another case being called, both parties left the court, perfectly
PIUS’S FICTIONS.
FRow a correspondence that has recently appeared in the papers, it
seems that a certain person, named Gawthoan, has been writing letters
to the ARCHRISHOF or CANTERBURY and others, sometimes in the
character of a dissenter, sometimes in that of a high-churchman, and
sometimes in his own—that of a papist—signing himself at one time,
FRANCIS, at another, Reks, and at another, WILLIAM, REEs FRANCIS
3AWTHORN, in full. The excuse of FRANCIs, alias REEs, alias
GAwTHoRN, is thus stated by himself:
“I assure you I had no object in writing the letter (besides complying with the re-
quest of my friend, to whom I am under great obligations) but to hasten the conversion
of those who profess High Church principles to the Catholic Church. I merely wrote
the letter at the particular request of the friend to whom I refer, and in the hope that it
might tend towards the conversion of those concerned, which we believe to be the
greatest blessing they can receive.”
We hope our readers will not suppose that MR. GAwTHoRN is no
other than the trustworthy correspondent that occasionally favours us
under the signature of “WERAx”—who scorns deceit .# imposture,
and does not pretend that his epistles to Punch are signed with his
proper name. Really, scarcely a week passes without some monstrous
figment, fabricated in behalf of “the Church,” being brought home
to some Romish ecclesiastic, agitator, or zealot. Does the “Holy
Father” of Rome know of this?—if he does, Mr. Punch will be obliged
to establish a story-tellers' corner, in which to put the children of that

HERALDIC FRAGMENTS.
THE intelligent reader (for, of course, every reader of Punch is intelligent) has now
some notion how a shield is divided, and what sort of things are º º it. The
subject is not—when treated with a certain, &c, &c., (here we blush modestly, gules)—an
altogether uninteresting one; though too, often heraldic books are so terribly dull, that in
them the shield, like the shield of Mºngsa, petrifies the lookers-on. - -
From the words, “pale, bend, bar,” &c., are formed adjectives of corresponding meaning.
Thus, when the field is marked with vertical lines, it is called “paly,” and paly º so-and-so,
according to the number of them. If you wanted, for instance, to blazon the face of a fast
man of loose habits, you would say that he was." º of three,” meaning that he had three
times indulged in pale ale, and loºked accordingly. In the same º * might accurately
describe the window of a spunging-house as barry; meaning that it ha several bars across
it. Combinations of these, also, are not unfrequent; a well-secured spunging-house window
might be barry-bendy, or paly-bendy, according to the direction of the bars. Were a human
face to be seen, pressed anxiously, from within, against the said window, the whole field might
be described as a human face deſruised of bars, for any animal having an ordinary laid over
it, is said to be, debruised. To say that our very old friend, that remarkable animal, the
s: has been debraised in every possible way, lately, is to venture on a jest of a character
as obvious as the said Stag's want of character.
indeed
... Note, that all these ordinaries are subject to
little modifications, which make the science
delightfully complicated. A bar may be ailed
or indented at the edges, though one would think
the worthy object would be quite sufficiently
irritating without anything of the sort.
Among sub-ordinaries we must notice a few
º not to be treated with contempt. The
pile is one of them. It consists of two fe ter-
minating in a point. How we must all wish that
our worthy pile, the New Houses of Parliament
would only terminate with equal definiteness?
And another sub-ordinary is the lozenge, which
is in the shape of a diamond. The reader who
º be inclined to try our patent lozenges, will
find them sufficiently attractive as bearings; and,
a shield lozengy is calculated to remové
the coldness with which a less retty one would
the idea of a knight's º:
er
he regarded. . We must not forget the guttes,
ºr drops, which also belong to this class. These
drops are of various tinctures, and if you are
inclined to take a drop, you must particularise
accordingly. A shield aving these on it is
described as gutte d'or, gutſ; de sang, &c., accord-
Hing to their colour. The fast man above men-
|tioned, would be gutte d'or, if his countenance
ibetokened that he was in the habit of charging
himself with liquids of a bright colour.
There are some odd little things, called roundles,
alsº, which include bezants, oranges, pommes, &c.
“Bezants” are said to have been Eastern coins
assumed from the Crusades. Whether this im-
º that the ancestors of our old-families
helped themselves to the money of thematives
and then adopted this figure as emblematic of
the exploit-or whether they received the bezants
as loans when in pecuniary difficulties—we don't
know. There is something very humiliating in
“Two bezants
more, and up, goes the Crus ”—yet surely
ºpins could not have been honoured as symbols,
if they had not been found by some of their
bearers of very vital importance. When a shield
is scattered over with an indefinite number of
roundles, it is said to be semée of them. Thus
poor Ass Hicks's stall in Hyde Park was nº
of oranges, pommes, and torteaur (cakes). Surely,
LoRD Seymour ought to have sympathised with
so honourable a bearing; but . he was
heightened in his zeal, as guardian of the Park,
by knowing that he bears three Lions passant,
guardant-aspart of the “augmentation” granted
tº Lapy. Seymoy Rºby HENRY THE Eighth.
The said Lions might be much more honourably
employed, however, than in capsizing apple-stalls.

mics, many of them weavers—
one of whom made the following
patriotic and political observa.
tion :-
“Foreigners may boast of their
liberty, equality, and fraternity; but is
not this something like fair play and
equality? The Government send one
band to play to the nobs in Kensington
Gardens, and they send another band
to play to us here.”
“Surely,” adds VIGIL, “the
Government, have touched the
right string in this case; ” with
the tenor of which remark we
agree, º: musically speak-
ing, we object to the word
“string:” as no instrument that
can warrant the use of that term
is employed in a military band.
The best music requires, for its
execution, violins, and we do
not think that Ministers would
be chargeable with fiddleſaddle
if they were to establish com-
plete orchestras, with a view of
playing on the higher feelings of
the *; Neither—we trust
—will this suggestion be re-
sponded to by the derisive
exclamation—“A fiddlestick!”
Perish also the vile punster who
would, in the remotest manner
hint that the idea of the musical
reformation of society is a-we
º *u- cannot write the word—the
equivalent of half a minim. If
those who have no music in their souls are fit for “treasons, stratagems, and spoils,” it follows
that the cultivation of the popular musical faculty must, on the other hand, tend greatly to
create a general unfitness for such atrocities; .# thus materially to diminish the numbers
of ginger-beer-bottle patriots, rogues, and pickpockets. . It would, therefore, be a capital
thing to send a band of Missionaries, with a Conductor at their head (and a Leader besides),
into the lanes and alleys, and up the courts, to charm savage breasts, and humanise brutes, as
ORPHEUs did. Such a force, with the brave Jullien as Commander-in-chief, would ensure
tranquillity—even though its services, should sometimes be required in a Row Polka.
Expense may be some objection to this scheme: and Government, perhaps, at present does
all it can, by employing, the only musicians, at its command. ... It is pleasant to see our army
engaged in preserving order with drums and fifes instead of with bayonets; and we like the
comical motion of civilising the rougher classes in this way, by the aid of the military.
HERALDIO FRAGMENTS.
THERE is one practice rigidly observed in Heraldry which we should be glad to, see intro-
duced into common life...It is the practice of describing what has to be described in the
briefest, tersest manner. There is nothing a Herald hates so much as tautology. “Blazoning,”
or heraldic description, is pointed and precise. Thus, if you, bear on a white shield a black
chevron with three cross-crosslets on it, say, white also:while there are three red roses on
the field ppr., we will suppose:-how do you go to work to describe the arms?–Simply,–ary,
on a chevron sa.. between three roses ppr., three cross-crosslets, of the first. The term “ of
the first,” avoids the repetition of the colour-the colour Qught never to be repeated, nor
the description prolonged. To illustrate from common life, Hif, you wanted, to describe
CAHILL, as a boar more dangerous than the generality of his order, but restrained from biting
by legal penalties, you wºuld state his case quite simply by saying that he was a boar, sable,
tusked, muzzled, or. How many “patriots” might be happily touched off by the expression
“muzzled, or /*. How clearly it defines a certain mercenary taciturnity!, This heraldic pointed-
ness is quite estimable in its way. Why take pains to delineate at length, some unworthy
impostor unworthily enriched—when the expression, a º gorged, or, settles him in three
words? For, gorged describes the ornament encircling the neck of a bird; and the ornament
is almost always a rich one. A goose gorged with gold, is no infrequent phenomenon in
| modern civilisation.
The word issuing is also susceptible of remark
able application. We hear of “a cross-crosslet
issuing from a crescent, sable,” as the crest
acquired by an old family in the Crusades. But
our days have witnessed the cross issuing from
all sorts of quarters. A remarkable cross has
issued from a square, or—we mean Golden
Square. The varieties of the cross are very
numerous. Sometimes, it is a cross, fleury—as
in the case of a dandy ecclesiastic, or a gaudy
church., Sometimes, it is voided—which means,
as the heralds tell us, that the “inner part is
taken ºig a church that has lost
charity and purity. Sometimes, it is engrailed,
signifying that the bearer desires to present a
jagged and torturing edge to all whom he
approaches. Sometimes, it is all of these:–
symbolising—what? Certainly not any church
or ecclesiastic mild, modest, and self-denying—
but worthy to be the token of bodies and indivi-
duals altogether the contrary –And so, Heraldry
may have a meaning and application in our days,
as in former ones.
THE FRENCH GIRL, ROSE.
A Song of a Modern Saint.
Dedicated to DR. NEWMAN.
OH ! my Saint is like the French girl, Rose,
TAMISIER by surname,
And leads me gently by the nose,
With wonders just the same.
A heart, tattoo'd upon her breast,
Stains handkerchiefs and clothés;
Of course through miracle imprest,
As by the French girl, Rose.
Her angel wakes me with a knock,
Each morn, at her command;
And puts new buttons on my frock,
At times, with unseen hand;
Sºlº in the air she prays,
'hen on her knees she goes:
And I believe whate'er she says,
And in the French girl, Rose.
What MR, LEWIS could not teach,
With all his pains and art,
My Saint, by means above his reach,
Can instantly impart:
She’ll cause a simpleton to write,
To read who not e'en knows;
And that by superhuman light,
Just like the French girl, Rose.
A round of toast was seen, one day,
Into her mouth to jump.
These marvels, scorn them as ye may,
I swallow in a lump.
From holy pictures, at her word,
A wondrous ichor flows:
True faith no statement deems absurd,
Nor doubts the French girl, Rose.
My Saint shone brightly in the dark,
And flew across the sea,
Convey’d by an obedient shark,
So great a Saint was she
Not half hysterical, half “do,”
As heretics suppose;
Oh no, my brothers!—more than you,
Or than the French girl, Rose.

126 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DEBT AND GLORY.
EcENTLY the papers have published
a list of the amounts of the public
debts and standing armies of all
the states of Europe. It seems,
from this document, that glory, as
represented by the military, does not
pay; for every state that has a
standing army, has a running debt to
º
liabilities. When we run our eye
down the list, and find England
heading it with a debt equal to one
half of what is owed by all Europe
put together, we may naturally start
at the penalty of greatness, and almost
envy the littleness of some of the
petty principalities, whose happy con-
dition is described by the words, “No
debt, no army.”
There are a few of the places men-
tioned whose standing armies must
be regarded as standing jokes, for
what could Lichtenstein do with its
sixty men? which is the number of
its entire soldiery. We defy the
sovereign of the place to get up even
a respectable ballet with such a
...? limited corps of supernumeraries;
and as to war, should such a thing
be declared, the idea of sending sixty
men into a field of battle is simply
ludicrous. Lichtenstein seems to us to be about a match for
Herne Bay; and should that ambitious watering-place ever wish to
measure the truncheon of its policeman with the sword of the warrior,
we, think there could be no. fairer contest than the little shingly
bathing-place with the shabby little Duchy.
We should not be surprised to see an advertisement in Bell's Life
some day, on the part of the Bay, intimating that “if the Duchy
means business, the Bay is to be heard of, any day, at So-and-So's
sporting house; ” nor should we be astonished at the arrival of a parcel
by the South-Eastern Railway from Lichtenstein, declaring the Duchy
to be in a state of perfect readiness to post the rhino at any bank of the
Rhine, on receiving proper notice.
We were rather astonished at finding Darmstadt pretty strong in
numbers, both as to debt and soldiers; but when we remember that
during the summer season every watering-place has its “Duke of
Darmstadt’s brass band,” we can easily account for the army being
numerous, to admit of its being cut up into green-baize bands, and sent
about collecting, perhaps in the summer, sufficient to support the
expense of winter ſquarters. Hesse Homburg has an army, which
seems large for the place, amounting to 350 men; but when we recol-
lect how many waiters are required at the baths, and at the other
national establishments, we see at once how such a force can be made
available. The Duchy of Baden has also an army, large in comparison
to the importance or non-importance of the place, and its debt is heavy;
but one or two good seasons at roulette would pay off the national debt;
and the troops are always available as croupiers, and in other kindred
capacities.

OMNIBUS REVIVALS.
TALK of the revivals on the Stage—they are nothing to the Omnibus
Revivals. An Omnibus plays many parts in its day. It first comes
out, spick-span new, all gold and gaudy colours. It runs its brilliant
career-goes to the Bank regularly five or six times a-day—till at last
it retires with rheumatic springs, or a pain in its side, arising from a
broken, panel. It is sent to the º: and put, as soon as it is
allowed to go out again, on easy work that will not test its strength too
much. It is next trieſ on little journeys where there is no opposition
on the road. It is “let out for the day.” It takes Young Gentle-
men's Schools out on picnics, or is entrusted with a valuable load of
old ladies, who are making their annual visit to the Opera, and have
made an express stipulation with the 'Bus to be taken home before
eleven. It does its work steadily—despises all the pomps and vanities
of ; letters and pretty colours—and walks about—it can scarcely be
called running-in a plain suit of quiet Qmnibus drab. It mostly moves in
the suburbs, where it is in great requisition at nights, attending at the
various §. of the neighbourhood, besides being a constant
visitor at the Mechanics’ Institute, whenever any Professor from London
comes down to exhibit the last fashionable quackery of the day. But
the Omnibus is getting old. It begins to get more shaky every day.
ſts windows rattle—its doors are seized with odd convulsions, that
allow no one any rest—and it is as much as it can do to get one wheel
before another. It disappears one , wet night—having fallen, from
extreme weakness, into a ditch—and we next see it on Epsom
course. It is plying, for hire from the Railway Station to the Downs.
It is a poor tumble-down, crazy concern—and persons who get into
it, from pity, are sure to get out of it quickly from disgust. It looks
terribly cut up, and as if it were tied together afterwards by strings,
like a ready-carved fowl, and you imagine, if one string was cut, that
all the limbs of the poor thing must tumble about on all sides in
different directions—when it would require the cleverest surgeon in
match, and does not discharge its 'Bus anatomy to put them together again. We thought that some such
ifate as this was always the last stage in the career of an Omnibus; but
we were disappointed. It seems that there was another torture in
reserve for the poor tortured, expiring vehicle—and that was the
Exhibition | - -
Look at the long string of decrepit, invalided, emaciated, worn-out
Qmnibuses, as they stand, any day outside the Crystal Palace. Was
there ever such a melancholy lot of Omnibus Revivals? Some with a
little paint to make them look spruce—as they put a young actress in
an ...if comedy, to make it go off better. Some with a new set of
wheels—as they advertise a lumbering old melo-drama, with “new
effects,” to make it run a little longer. Others are patched up in
the most piteous fashion—the patches barely hiding the scars and
wounds with which their mutilated bodies are gashed all over. Every
|artifice is resorted to in order to conceal the ravages of time and
ill-usage; and if there was a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Omnibuses, not one of the unsightly carriages—whose miserable
sides are made to carry a long plank, on which is painted, or chalked,
or pinned, the word “Exhibition”—would be allowed to make such a
painful exhibition of itself in public. All the old omnibuses in the world
are here collected together; and if you have missed a favourite old
'Bus for more than ten years, one which you are confident must have
been condemned to the î. long ago, walk down to Kensing-
ton, near the Symposium, and there we will wager you the best dinner
SoYER can give, (and that is not saying much,) that you will find your
favourite old 'Bus still plying, crawling for hire, ſrisking spasmodically
about, and attempting all the freshness of a one-year-old 'Bus.
An Omnibus is noted for its wonderful tenacity of life; and we
really believe if you were to cut one up into half-a-dozen pieces, that,
like a worm, they would all join again, and that it would still go on
running. Notwithstanding these wonderful attributes, however, we

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. BRIGGS ON
HE FIRST.
FORTUNATELY FoR MR. BRIgGs (who WILL LOAD HIs own GUN BECAUSE THEN HE KNows what HE Is ABOUT) The KEEPER
Discovers THAT HE HAs PUT ABOUT THREE QUARTERs of A Pound of SHOT INTo His RIGHT-HAND BARREL.
LARKING ON THE RAILWAY.
MR. PUNCH, a few evenings ago, between half-past eight and nine
o'clock, was travelling (with is characteristic valour) in a second-class
carriage of an up-train on the London and Windsor Railway.
In the same carriage—but happily not in the same compartment of
it with Mr. Punch—there was a party of six or seven gents. The
eldest of them might have been some four-and-twenty, the rest two or
three years younger. Their exterior was fashionable, after the fashion
of the Minories—their manners were, perhaps, rather less gentleman-
like than their *;
These gents had evidently been ºf their intellects—poor
though the offering was—to BAcchus; for their faces were flushed,
their conversation was noisy and unmeaning, their merriment excessive,
and apparently causeless; and moreover they made allusions to “that”
sº or Natural Sherry, and also to a species of wine, which they
called Uc.
They sang “Rule Britannia’’—that is, one part of them roared the
song so called, and others a free choral accompaniment of “Tol de rol,
de rol, de rol, de ray.”—In like manner, they also sang “Buffalo Gals,”
and “I’m Afloat,” which last canticle struck Mr. Punch as very appro-
priate to the state of gents who were half-seas over.
They sustained a loud and lively interchange of that sort of banter
termed by the lower order of cads “chaff,” whereof the ". portion
was unintelligible to Mr. Punch, and the whole, it is to be hoped, was
Hebrew to two ladies, who had likewise the misfortune to be in the
carriage.
The gents further amused themselves by tilting each other's hats off;
and one of these jokes elicited the repartee of “I beg leaf to observe,
Sir, that that’s my at.” Occasionally their “ats” were knocked over into
Mr. Punch's compartment, and were smilingly handed back to their
proprietors by that gentleman, who happened to be in even a more than
usually amiable frame of mind. -
By way of variety in their sports and pastimes, the gents got one of
their number down on his back, and poked him with their canes, and
tried to keep him there. Another of their diversions consisted in push-
ing one another about, in such a manner, that, if the handle of the left-
hand door had, by chance, been unturned, the door might have been
thrown open, and one or more of the gents out.
In the midst of an animated intermixture of conversation and song,
the possibility. of a collision was mooted among the gents, to the no
small º of their mirth. A gent remarked that “it would be
a great, loss to society”—alluding to himself and his companions, who
laughed inordinately at his observation; but rather, it seemed, in
admiration of his manly levity, than from any appreciation of his uncon-
Scious satire.
. Indeed, Mr. Punch, never heard so much laughter, with so little wit,
in any society, as in that of these gents.
Mr. Punch would suggest to railway directors, the expediency
of taking due precautions, not only against those ordinary con-
cussions which are daily occasioning loss of life and limb on rail-
ways, but also inst the . shocks that, delicate natures are ex-
posed to in second-class carriages, from the jocosities and gambols
of excited, gents. ... He is desirous that the Misses Punch should
travel and improve their minds, but he would certainly not wish that
either their vocabulary, or their knowledge of life, should be enlarged
by the kind of experience that he has above described. Indulgence in
free, expressions and riotous demeanour (one of the gents, by-the-by,
used this word, and pronounced it demeaniour) is, Mr. Punch believes,
called in the gentish dialect a “Lark.” Let there, then, be added to all
trains another class of carriages, to be called “Larking Carriages,” where
birds of a larkish feather may enjoy themselves, without disgusting
those of a more sober plumage. None but themselves should be con-
º to the company of gents under the influence of Natural Sherry
alloi UC.

Paper, are earnestly requested to make the speediest application for bits of the

Millions. Come early. No bigotry! All religions taken in.

MRs. BLoomeR to THE FEMALE RACE,
[Favoured by Mr. Punch.
“Womſºn AND SISTERs,
“THE great Question that has slumbered beneath the Ignorance
and Idleness of Ages is at length awake, and crying. Need Isay, that
Question is Petticoats?
“Petticoats have been the Badge of our Slavery to Man. But the
dawn approaches—the hour is about to strike—when with one accord
we may snap the Strings ºf our Yoke, and stand erect in the face ºf our
Persecutor/ -
“My Sisters, it is my wish to deal with this Convulsing Question—a
Question destined, as I believe, to shake the very Ends of the Earth, to
say nothing of every Fireside—with a Mildness that shalſ convince, and
a Softness THAT shall, DIs ARM. With the Boldness of the Eagle, I would
unite the Tenderness of the Dore,
cast a look long backward at the causes of Petticcats, not everywhere
to behold the Hand of the Tyrant and the Destroyer Man. Goodness
knows! I should be the last Person—if I know myself, the very last—
tº say a word that could offend—but this I must say; from the Dawn
of Time we have been crushed to the Earth by the heel of our Oppressor;
and at length—the Horm has Turned!
“My Sisters, The Cunning of our Arch-Destroyer is banefull
developed in the Fashion that like an Iron Manacle he has smilingly
forced upon us—the Fashion that makes any distinction whatever between
the Dress of Man, and the Garments of Woman / You will immediately
%. that this Distinction—the Cunning Device of the Barbarous
eginning of Time-was invented as a sort of Livery by which that
Intolerant Bigot, Man, (if I may be allowed the expression) has, for
Ages, Yoked us, as Trophies, to His Triumphant Car; trailing us and
our Ignominious Petticoats in the Debasing Dirt.
“The true Jºality of the Sexes can never exist until there is a true
#. ºf Cºstume. The independence of the Intcard Mind must be
snown #: Liberty ºf the Outward Dress, My Sisters, do not deem
me an Enthusiast; but I hope to live to see the Day (for I am, if
possible, even much younger than 1 look) when 'twixt Men and Women
there shall be no Outward Distinction whatever; when an Admiralgſ the
eet may be mistaken for his Wife; and a Lady Chancellor to all out-
ward * be every bit as good as My Lord. ‘Bone of bone and
flesh of flesh!”. Yes—when there is Ermine of Ermine and Broad cloth
of Broa "... Then there will be the true Equality of Women; then,
and neve, untº then / But all this in Good Time. The Present Move.
ment (that we may not too violently disturb the Bigotted Prejudices of
our oppressors, as I must be allowed to call them)—the Present Move-
ment is with Petticoats.
“Frºm this moment, let every woman really worthy of that improved
§nd still improving title-let every woman look upon Petticoats as
things ºf the Pasſ; relics of the Dark Ages; Rags cast off and
Nevertheless, it is impossible, if we ?
Fluttering down the Abyss of Oblivion. Yes; I see Woman rise from
her Petticoats, as the long-imprisoned Butterfly rises from its cripplin
and confining sheath! That Butterfly in its Caterpillar Condition crawl
upon the Earth, and licked up the Mud and the Dirt. And now behold
it, opening and shutting its Beautiful Wings in the Air; now balancing
º a Carnation, and now upon a Rose. That Butterfly, my Sisters-
%! will, | must be bold enough to say as much)—that Butterfly tº dº
downer.
“Wires and Mothers, -my first Appeal is to You. To You, future
generations may look forward for Emancipation from their Bonds.
You are strong; and therefore, in this Vital Question of Petticoats, you
must be up and stirring. - - - -
“Wºmen are timid. It is not my mission to hide anything. Women
are timid. It is the fault of their social state. But the time will come
when the true woman will have the like audacity with her present oppressor,
—nevertheless, (for I will not disguise the fact)—at present woman is
of the weaker sex. Oh, for another half-century, and there will be no
weaker sex!, No: one will be just as weak and as strong as the other/
“Buttoreturn to an embarrassing fact—Women are timid. Especially
the young, the º and the inexperienced. Therefore, wives an
º in this Pital morement of Péticoats, my Hope is in you?
ºf will not work upon your feelinº? I will not paint to you the fears,
the terrors, of the Unmarried—awed by the Tyranny of an Insulting
jºleiriº; yet fearing, to break the bonds of Petticoats. See that
eauteous Dºre'ſ How it peers from its nest. Now on this side—now
on that! And now it tries a branch of its parent tree. And, now it
hops from twig to twig. And now it looks abroad—abroad—into the
wide, and blue, and circling ether! Shall it fly? Yes—no! And now
—the little Dove has spread its wings, and taken its first adventurous
flight / And now it returns to its parent bough, and its little heart
flutters with joy, and it coos and coos with triumph!
“Such is the timid virgin, who would be a-Bloomer! -
“See her in plumage ſº herſº flight / She tripsin her bºudoir in
dread and fear. She looks from the window-her nest—into the
street! With a beating heart she trips down stairs—the street-door
stands * There—there on the other side of the threshold—is a
cold £º a hungry, and insulting world! This she knows; and,
ſ she the true spººf a woman ºf a woman fit for the future
ſº º her sex—she throws down the guage, for she crosses the
oºr-step
“The YoungBloomer is in the street /
“And, if she has a soul, she feels herself in a complete suit of mail
armour; and the looks and jeers of men fall harmless as sugar-plums
about her virgin º
“But—for, as I have said, it is not my mission to hide anything—but
every virgin is not made to become, of her own accord, a Bloomer/
Therefore, my hope is in the ifarriº, yes, and the Widowed. In this
great social Question of Petticoats, none can be too ºld, by precept and
example, to assist. I confess it, in the Bloomer Movement, I count
greatly upon the Dowagers/ -
“And wherefore? ſence has given them courage. Time has
taught them all the Arts of the Oppressor / In this War against the
Social Tyranny of Man-let this be understood—no Woman is Erempt
y Age.
“And now, Wires, to you I address myself! And I ask you as
women, beginning even at the twelfth hour and fifty-ninth minute to feel
your own strength, I ask you, what have you to fear? Compassion
may be shown towards those—weak and timid—who have yet to get
husbands; but having pot them,-you are, or ought to be, every one of
you, your own mistress.
“You will remember—for it is not my wish to strain the tenderness of
any conscience-you will remember that there is nothing in the Marriage
Ceremony that à. directly, or indirectly, touch, upon the point of
costume. Not a word. The Question of fetticoats is never agitated
—never. The compact that makes ‘bone of bone,” implies not one
syllable against trouser of trouser.
“But I would begin with the beginning. And I earnestly exhort
every Bride to be married as a Bloomer/ Let no woman consent to
take a husband, who, at the last minute, will not take his Bride full
Blooming / Again: let no bride have any Bridesmaid who has not the
mºral courage tº assert her own dignity by such a ceremonious disapowal
of petticoats. When the reform begins in the Church—when Woman
breaks her *}. at the Very Steps ºf the Altar—then Woman may
begin to look abroad upon the Universe, and claim her place/
“Women and Sisters, I Rest
“Your Sister and Champion,
“Bloomer.”
A very odd Lot.
A Mr. Loft, a Common Councilman, expressed, the other day, a
* that the public would soon cease to be influenced by the Press,
and that there would be no leading articles. We must give the
Common Council credit for real philosophy, if it can feel contented
with its Lott.

A youth, whose look told in a trice
That his taste chose the queer device-

He tapp'd a cane against his teeth;
His eye was bloodshot, and there rung,
Midst scraps of slang, in unknown tongue,

In calm first-floors he saw the light
Of circles cosy for the night;
But far ahead the gas-lamps glow ; , , -
He turn’d his head, and murmurd" Slow,”

“Come early home,” his Uncle said,
“We all are early off to bed;
The family blame you far and wide;”
But loud that noisy youth replied-

“Stay,” said his Aunt, “come home to sup;
Early retire—get early up.”
A wink half quivered in his eye;.
He answered to the old dame's sigh-

“Mind how you meddle with that lamp :
And mind the pavement, for it’s dampſ!”
Such was the F. last gºnigh -
A faint voice stutter'd out “All right.”

At break of day, as far West-ward
A cab roll'd o'er the highways hard,
The early mover stopp'd to stare
At the wild shouting of the fare—

And by the bailiff's faithful hound,
At breakfast-time, a youth was found,
Upon three chairs, with aspect nice,
True to his young life’s queer device,

They bore him to the Benc º

CURE FOR RAILWAY CARELESSNESS.
WE continually read in the º of an accident occurring on this
or that railway, “which might have been attended with serious con-
sequences.” -
mewhat less frequently—but still very º indeed—we read
of a railway accident which “has been attended with serious conse-
quences;” namely, with the death or mutilation of a large number of
human beings, º the loss of parents and friends, and with them of the
means of subsistence to various persons and families, more or fewer.
An accident which has been “attended with serious consequences,”
renders any railway company, on whose line it may have occurred, from
neglect or want of reasonable precaution, liable to heavy damages.
ow if Parliament, in its wisdom, were to impose the same penalty
in the shape of a fine, on any company, similarly culpable, in the case o
any acci

And º in its yet higher wisdom, Parliament were to declare
that any kage or detangement of machinery, any cºllision, or any
engine getting off the line, shall be presumed to imply, neglect and
carelessness, and considered to be an "acciden; which might have been
attended with serious consequences,” and shall be attended with a
serious fine?

OUR AUSTRALIAN AND KIENSINGTON COLONIES.
MR. BATTY, we understand, has
made arrangements for ex-
pediting the communica-
tion between the Bank
and Kensington—ajourney
which has hitherto had
many incidents to place it
on a par with the voyage
between England and Aus:
tralia. While economy of
time has been a considera-
tion on nearly all our home
nd º routes, the
º: rom London to
dney, and from Kensing-
to the Bank, have
rmed the two discredit-
able exceptions to the
general
raff of travelling. The con-
cation with Australia
may be tendered for are
- already before the public;
but we have the pleasure to submit the following heads of stipulations
to be observed by any one º the transport of the mails to or
from Sydney, and the males and females to or from the Bank and
Kensington:-
The tenders are to be made for steamers propelled by screws, and
omnibuses not propelled by screws, but by cattle that can peg away at
a rate to be agreed upon,
The journeys are to be made without stoppage of steamers at the
Cape, or of omnibuses for the cape—of the conductor or driver, in case
of a sudden shower.
The steam-packet contractors must be prepared to go six times
a-year to and from Sydney; and the omnibuses must be ready to start
six times a-day to and from the Bank and Kensington.
The steamers must go eight knots an hour; and the omnibus drivers
must have eight knots in their whips to ensure the same rate of
travelling.
The vessels to be supplied with charts, furniture, anchors, pumps,
&c.; and the omnibuses to be supplied with tables of fares, cushions,
drags, and either pumps or highlows, for the conductor to make a decent
º: In. - -
he vessels not to loiter, deviate from the course, or put back, but
to proceed at once to the line; and the omnibuses not to loiter, go
#. of their course, or put back, but to get into the line at the Mansion
ouse.
The above are a few of the most salient points of the conditions to be
observed in tendering for the new contracts about to be entered into:
and we trust that arrangements will soon be carried out which will
bring Australia and Kensington within the sphere of those improvements
in travelling of which almost every other portion of the civilised world
has long since enjoyed the benefit.
A SOWEREIGN OF A DOUBTFUL STOCK.
THE Austrian Government, according to the Vienna Correspondent
| * Times, is negotiating a loan, to be raised by general subscription;
ul
“England, probably as a punishment for its political hostility, is to be denied the
privilege of transmuting its hard cash into Austrian paper.”
English capitalists may consider themselves insulted by the Austrian
Government's refusal tº borrow ºf them; but they ought, at the same
time, to feel obliged. If they º convert their money into Austrian
paper, the best thing they could dº with that material would be to
make fool's caps with it. It is to be feared that the creditors of the
MPERoR of AustrºA will receive very limited dividends; since, for
flagrant tyranny, * barefaced º ºf faith, there is probably at
hand a day of reckoning which will leave his despotic MAJESTY without
a crown.
Naples Dissatisfied.
THE Correspondent of the Daily News writes that the Kng of
NAPLEs is not satisfied with the pamphlet of the Anglo-Neapolitan,
MacFARLANo: he did not go far enough. This is a little too bad.
The pamphleteer went over head and ears; dyed himself in his ink-
bottle. It is plain the King of Nº. would have an Ethiop more
than black. How much soot does Majesty think can be made to

N the workhouse school-room, choky and small,
That looks out on the workhouse wall,
Sit the pauper children, drearily,
Under the pauper mistress' rule,... . -
Mumbling, and stumbling, and stuttering wearily,
Over the tasks of the workhouse school;
While the sun-light smites uncheerily
Sodden faces, blank of thinking, .
Eyes that cannot keep from blinking,
Little bodies, sore and sinking
That scarce hold up on bench and stool.
But on the side that’s out of the sun,
In the furthest corner, and darkest one,
Two little pauper heads are minglin
Their scanty growth of pauper curls,
Two little pauper faces tingling,<
Two pair of pauper eyes rain pearls,
As two little hands go slowly singling
The sense, .# by word, of those tattered pages,
Hoary and brown with the thumbing of ages.
What is the lesson that so engages

The glorious book of º lore,
That charms even pauper childhood's leisure,
With its marvellous tales of dwarf and giant,
Of ladies distraught, and knights defiant,
And a world of wonder that moves compliant
Tojthe waving wand of the fairy corps.

And the two are reading the story old,
Wherein of CINDERELLA is told
How she crouch'd at the kitchen fender,
And how, in her poor clothes and worn,
She was fairer than in their splendour
Her sisters, stately and fulſ of scorn;
For loveliness lives not with hearts untender;
And how, with their Fº and trains a-sweeping,
They drove to the ball, and she went creeping
Back to her ashes, and there sat weeping;
And how, to the maiden all forlorn,
Çame the fairy godmother true;
And then-oh, wonders ever new l—
Of the pumpkin-coach, and the mice that drew it,
With its old grey-whisker'd coachman rat,
And the green-coat lizards for footmen to it;
And how in the ball-room, where she sat,
She was the fairest, and never knew it;
And how, of Time's flight, Twelve struck, to remind her,
And she fled, and left her glass-slipper behind her,
And the Prince sought the wearer, and did find her,
And she lived a Queen ever after that I
% blessed Fancy, that chases the gloom
ven of that blank workhouse room!
Their little heads and hearts are working,
And wond'ring if fairy god-mothers now
n_chimney-corners may be lurking—
When comes the sharp word and sharper blow :
“Drat you! take that, your tasks for shirking!”
Alas! the chiding and cane so ready
Are Fact's stern warning to fancies heady
That back to the workhouse jog-trot steady
he world's poor paupers is quick to cow.
THE SLEEPING-ROOM.
Little breaths come hot and hard
In the crowded children's ward,
Where three and four in a bed are sleeping;
While our fairy-ridden pair
Vigils of the brain are keeping,
For the ſays are busy there,
And in night-long revel sweeping,
i. Fancy's treasures, hoarded
n the workhouse, sad and sordid,
With a liberal hand afforded—
Wealth of dream-land, rich and rare
THE WARING.
Hark! the workhouse clock strikes five,
And the crowded room’s alive;
Careless hands of pauper nurses
Shake the sleepers out of bed,
And that done, with cuffs and curses
Bows each little pauper's head,
And its parrot-prayer rehearses;
Then, their breakfast bolted wandering,
The half conqueri slumber blundering, -
To the i. they’re march'd, while thundering
Through the gate the vans are led.
THE RIDE.
What the journey they’re to go,
Little do they care to know, -
Blunted by j. workhouse training;
So the vans they roll along,
Without question or complaining:
But the power of sleep is strong,
And, as now the Park they’re gaining,
Haif the troop is sunk in slumber,
Our two friends among the number),
enser crowds the way encumber,
Scarce the vans can cleave the throng.
THE VISION.
The vans have come to a sudden stop,
And their sleepy freight they drop;
And our little ones' eyes, in blank amazement,
Open upon a wondrous pile-
A range of glittering crystal casement,
Stretching along #: mile on mile;
Within all is wonder, from crown to basement;
--
Fountains of glass in sun-light glowing,
Great green trees and bright flowers growing,
And beautiful men and women flowing
In an endless stream from aisle to aisle !
Wonder on wonder—more and more
Gems, and jewels, and sparkling ore—
Is it real, or is it seeming,
This world of marvels they wander through?
“Qh yes! I know we are not dreaming;-
The book we yesterday read is true:
'Tis Fairy-land, so bright and beaming;
The fairy godmother of the story
Because we are friendless, and sad, and sorry,
Has changed the workhouse into a glory,
For pauper children like me and you.’
FLOWERS OF THE ORATORY.
LL º: readers are
aware that there was held,
the other day, at Birming-
ham, a Roman Catholic
meeting in honour and glory
of the Very Rev. DR. NEw-
º MAN: that DR. NEWMAN
ſº did thereat deliver himself
| of a speech, and that the
subjoined is an extract from
the reported oration of the
Father of the Oratory:—
“It was a curious thing for him
to say, though he was now of
mature age, and had been very
busy in many ways, yet this was
the first time in his life that he
had ever received any praise. He
had been in other places, and done
works elsewhere before being a
Catholic, but there was no re-
nse, no sympathy; it was not
the fault of the people, for they
could not respond.”
DR.NEwMAN, in this ob-
servation, affords a singular
instance of the truth that
extreme simplicity may ac-
company great abilities.
Considering what the great
Tractarian leader had been
doing all along at Oxford,
can it be wonderful to any-
body but DR. NEWMAN that he met with no approbation until he found
himself at Rome? -
The Very Reverend Father is represented as having proceeded to
say—
“Some instruments could only make beautiful music, and some from their very
nature could only make a noise. So it was with such a body as that to which he once
belonged—they could only make a noise—no echo, no response, no beautiful music,
But it was quite different when a person went into the Catholic Church.”
What does DR. NEwMAN, think of moans from Neapolitan dun.
geons P What of howls of sedition, rancour, and malice from fa

them instead, which he mistakes for beautiful music. When we re-
member, also, his extraordinary confession of faith in relics and modern
miracles, we cannot but entertain a serious apprehension that he is
labouring under a delusion which may be termed New—mania.

A NICE MESS FOR MESSMATES.
“PUNCH, ahoy!
“Here’s a precious paragraph for you, that I’ve cut out of
one of the newspapers, put in by some land-lubber:—
“‘TEA For THE NAvy.—Messrs. W. S. SHUTTLEworth & Co., of 86, Fenchurch
Street, have again taken a contract to supply 50,000 lbs. of tea for the use of the Navy.'
“Avast there ! I sung out when first I read this. Teal—tea for
British Seamen! What next? Bread-and-butter, I suppose, as though
they were young ladies at a seminary; and, a pretty boarding-school,

notion of tea on board a seventy-four—turning a man-of-war, d'ye
mind me, into an old woman.
... Howsomedever, when I’d chewed the matter over a bit, I twigged
it all. Steady! thinks I to myself. Belay!. How about the truth of
this story? It can't be., No, Punch, my hearty! I don't believe a

SOMETHING TO TAKE A SIGHT AT.
WENHAM ice is tolerably cool, but it is positively tepid compared
with the coolness of the following advertisement:–

He must be a member of the Hall or College. A young man wishing to see prac-
tice would be preferred, as no salary will be given. Apply to — —
A young man may have an intense desire, perhaps, “to see practice,”
but the look-out must be dismal indeed if unaccompanied by any
prospect of salary. We should like to know how the surgeon, in
town, would like to give his services upon the same terms as those he
offers to his assistant; and whether he would take a practice offered to
any duly qualified surgeon “wishing to see patients, as no fees will be
given P” It may be all very well to “see practice;” but, unless the
young professional enthusiast can see his way pretty clearly, how to
live without an income, the mere fact of “seeing practice” would
amount to a very visionary sort of benefit. The worthy assistant must,
it seems, put entirely out of the question all idea of serving himself, for
the very superior satisfaction of seeing, and, of course, assisting in
another person's practice. After this, we shall, not be surprised to
read advertisements for partners, stating that those will be preferred
who are desirous of “seeing business, as none of the profits will
be given.”

not been able to sleep. We have been tortured with one great fear,
which, as loyal subjects, has robbed us of rest, peace, appetite, every-
thing. It is perfectly well known that a certain Diamond, as big as
a walnut, is confined in a “safe” (the word seems to mockus), which
is secured by a lock, or a spring, or something of that sort, which has
een manufactured by Chūgº-tbut Cirupp offers no impediment to the
burglarious skill of Hobbs. Therefore, in an agony of anxiety—for

tremely odd lots that would be comprised in such an arrangement.

FOREIGN FAMILIES OF DISTINCTION IN LONDON.
EoPLE have cried out that
there were no foreigners in
London; yet London never
was so full of them as at the
resent moment. We almost
elieve there are more
foreigners in our metropolis
just now than Englishmen.
e only hope that, F.-M. the
DUKE, and other alarmists of
a Foreign Invasion, have
taken every precaution that
the guards at night are
doubled at the Tower, and
that the Bank, is sufficiently
defended to resist a nocturnal
attack.
We not only have foreigners
in units, and parties, and
| clubs, but we have whole
families of them coming over,
and exhibiting themselves, it
| may be, for the purpose of
| Fº º: their expenses. Lon-
on is presenting to the mind
of the philosopher a pleasant
picture of “Le Monde en Fa-
mille.” There is the Syrian
Family at the Egyptian Hall;
the Iroquois Family at Cat-
lin's Exhibition; the Chinese
Family at the Chinese
Gallery ; the Bushranger's
Family at Cremorne; the Al-
gerine Family at Vauxhall, or
somewhere; the Italian Bro-
thers at Drury Lane; to say
from all parts of the elastic

we may shortly expect the arrival of the following foreign families
of distinction:—
h THE Russian FAMILY. They will drink a pint of train oil every two
Ours.
THE FRENCH FAMILY. They will take up their quarters at the
Dramatic Authors’ Society. They will go through their wonderful
performances of a French #evºn, erecting a barricade, planting a
tree of liberty, with national songs, &c., twice a day.
THE TIMBuctoo BROTHERs, in their native costumes and sheep-
adornments. -
THE BROTHERs of THE DESERT, who will exhibit themselves in the
Exeter 'Change Arcade. A camel has been hired to give due effect to
the celebrated tableau of “The Death of the Camel.”
THE GERMAN Cousins of UNITED FATHERLAND, to the number of
1032, each little State sending its Cousin. . Each Cousin will, sing a
song about “Was ist das Waterland?” claiming it, of course, for his own
little individual State. The whole to conclude with the celebrated
farce of A German Constitution, which will be the signal for all the
1032 German Cousins to take his pipe, and, to begin talking and
smoking as vigorously as they can, which will continue for several
hours, and, only be cºncluded with a general fight, and the entry, of
IRussian soldiers, giving altogether a most striking idea of “United
Fatherland,” as understood by our German Cousins.
A NEAPOLITAN FAMILY—all in chains—fettered by the leg to felons
(sent orer by the kind permission of the KING OF NAPLEs).
A Roman FAMILY, with a French soldier standing over them, com:
º them—women, children, and all—to smoke “in the name of
he POPE.”
Should these and more arrive—including specimens of the newly;
discovered race in the interior of Africa—men and women who are said
to have tails, just like monkeys—all the different members of the large
“human family” will be assembled for the first time in London. It
would be an interesting sight to collect them all together in the
Crystal Palace, and give them a dinner, with WIDDIconſB in the chair,
he being confessedly the oldest member of the Human Family.
The Cabbage Rose, Tamisier.
WHEN the brothers of the Oratory met to discuss the last miracle of
the Cabbage, and agreed to receive it, FATHER WAGSTAFF said meekly,
“Which of us, dear brethren, would not embrace the Pope’s chou ?” A
faint smile passed round the refectory-table, and a table-spoonful of
split-peas was awarded to him as a recompense for the mild joke.
THE CUSTOM-HOUSE FILTER.
THIS is the slowest Filter on record. It is for the use of steam-
vessels. As soon as the steam-vessel arrives off the Custom-House,
the whole contents of it are poured º into the Filter. It is
most amusing, then, to watch the process of filtration. For two hours,
rather more than less, are the contents kept locked up in the Filter.
This is to allow them properly to settle. The space, in which they are
stowed away is not large; it being necessary to keep the body as
closely packed together as possible, so that nothing may be lost in the
process. As soon as the two hours have expired, a small door is opened
at one of the extreme ends, and the rush is tremendous. The object
is to prevent this rush, and accordingly the opening is made smaller
and smaller, till at last it is with difficulty anything can be got to pass
through it. The filtering then begins. It is extremely slow-so slow,
that it is only after hours that you can perceive that the body of people
locked up for filtration has in the least diminished in density. Only
one person is allowed to drop through at a time—so that if there are
three hundred persons waiting for their turn, it can easily be imagined
how long it will take before the whole mass can be cleared away, until
not a drop remains behind. Sometimes a heavy trunk blocks up the
narrow aperture. The filtration is them suspended, and the whole
forces of the Custom-House are brought to bear upon the removal of
the heavy trunk. Portmanteaus and carpet-bags are squeezed more
easily through; but reticules and ladies' boxes are sad stumbling-
blocks, owing to the number of bottles (whether of Bau-de-Colºgne or
Eau-de-vie, we cannot discuss,) that impede the free circulation. A bit of
sponge, placed in the palm of the hand in contact with a piece of silver,
will sometimes expedite, it is said, the filtration; but though the Custom-
House officers will lend their hands freely enough to the sponging
system, it has but very little effect upon the Filter itself, which seems
to take so many hours to empty itself, and will not be emptied sooner.
This Filter will keep in any climate; but nowhere does it act so well
as at the Custom-IIouse in London.
The following Testimonials, which we are happy to subjoin, will prove
its wonderful efficacy:—
“GENTLEMEN,
“I have used your Custom-House Filter, and am bound to
say that it acts slower than any other Filter I know. It is true it
leaves behind it a slight deposit of 6d. each package; but then the
settlement of this is got right rid of so very quickly, that I am sure no
one can possibly object to it.
“I remain, Gentlemen, your grateful servant,
“EBENEZER OLDFILE.”
“GENTLEMEN,
“I have been in the habit of using your Extraordinary Filter,
now, for the last ten years; and I must say that I know nothing like it
in the world. This is high praise; but not more than ſº deserve; for
I can safely say, that though I have been a traveller all my life, I never
met with any Filter that did its work half so searchingly, or so slowly,
as your Custom-House Filter; but the very slowness of its operations
is the strongest guarantee that nothing escapes it; for your Filter has
the particular faculty of clearing the smallest thing that passes
through it. (Signed) “CAPTAIN CARR. (Travellers' Club).”
“GENTLEMEN, -
“I can answer for the cleanliness of your Filter; for when I
went into it I had as much as fifteen shillings in my pocket; but when
I was “cleared .# I was so beautifully cleaned out, that I had
not a single sixpence left. “Jack Towell.
“To Her Majesty’s Officers and Commissioners of Customs.”
We have desks full of other testimonials. , Some from young ladies,
sighing to reach home; some from elderly ladies, complaining after a
long voyage of sea-sickness and fatigue, but still bearing testimony as
to how wonderfully the Filter had relieved them; and others from poor
foreigners, alluding in terms of comical distress to that same relief-
“for when they landed in England,” they say, “they might be full of
apprehensions as to the future, with only a few shillings in their pockets,
in a foreign country; but they no sooner left the Custom-House Filter,
than they felt relieved of everything.” All these testimonials breathe
the same sweet tone of unequivocal praise; but, after those we have
already printed, no one, we think, can have a doubt as to the admirable
workings of the Custom-House Filter, if he has, only let him take
a journey to Ostend and back again to London, and we are sure he will
be convinced at once.
Tea for the Navy.
SoMEBODY has just undertaken to supply no less than 50,000 pounds
of tea for the use of the Navy. This is a good sign, and the next piece
of agreeable news we expect to hear is, that tea will be the only sort of
gunpowder that our Navy requires.

He most wonderful instance of the fitness

accidental descent of a balloon-con-

The only improvement we could have

sequence of the bursting of the balloon,

appropriate enough that the place of

a burying-ground. . It is strange that
these airy enthusiasts will not take

A BID FOR THE NEW AUSTRIAN LOAN.
Mr. PUNCH presents his compliments to His Excellency the Austrian
Minister.
Mr. Punch has at this minute the sum of Three hundred, and fifty:
three thousand nine hundred and eleven pounds, three shillings, and
four pence, lying unemployed at his bankers, MESSRs. ALDGATE PUMP
and 8. of thi city, as reference to the books of those gentlemen will
fully prove.
It is Mr. P.'s desire to invest this sum as advantageously as
possible, as part of the fortune of his twelfth little girl.
In this country, the Chartists and the high price of the funds; in
France, the Red Republicans and the doubtful issue of the Presidential
Elections, rendering investments in English or French Stocks un:
available; the King of Prussia, being clearly not in his senses; and
the illustrious Spanish nation having already absorbed three million
one hundred and nineteen thousand seventy-six pounds of Mr. Punch's
loose capital, without making him any return, Mr. P. naturally
looked to Austria, as to a maligned but flourishing country, where
demagogues. were suppressed, order was restored, HAYNAU in a
graceful retirement, and a spirited and excellent '. monarch
established on the throne, blest with the vigour of youth, and the
instructions and advice of a religious mamma.
It was, them, HERR. Won PUNCH's intention to invest this portion of
his youngest child’s fortune in the New Austrian Loan, ºf the
greatest hope and confidence in the good faith and prosperity of that
mighty empire. . . -
Not good faith in promised ºil. constitutions be
hanged —but in the solvency and stability of the Imperial Government—
a good faith very much increased by the late Imperial declaration, that
his Imperial and Royal Majesty, having dissolved all previous engage-
ments made with his people, was, from this time forth, accountable to
GoD only for any measures which he might do, or undo, and for the sole
and supreme conduct of his empire.
Knowing his Imperial Majesty to be eminently religious, this direct
mode of settling accounts gave Mr. Punch (as a commercial man) the
deepest sense of security and satisfaction. For what could be more
delightful than to think that the next world was answerable for the new
five per cent. loan * or, in the event of the terrestrial non-payment of the
dividends, his Imperial Majesty, acting under the immediate sanction
and authority of Heaven itself, referred his creditor to the Great Firm
of which he was the sole Agent and Commissioner? A heretic Go-
vernment, or a borrower, who had no sense of religion, would offer some
sort of gross º security for a loan; whereas, it is far better to
transact business with a religious Sovereign, celestially delegated, taking
his most religious promise in strict confidence, and allowing him to act
without a complication of accounts, without responsible ministers, with-
out chambers, without consulting his people; indeed, without what are
called securities or embarrassments .# any sort. There is nothing like
simplicity in business transactions, and Mr. Punch, as a capitalist, would
have been delighted to lend a few hundred thousands on the Imperial
and Royal word of His Majesty the Emperor and King.
. Under these circumstances, Mr. P. is deeply vexed to find that there
is no office in the City of London where he can subscribe to the new
loan; and the more so, as he is aware that the circumstances of H.I.M.,
the delegate of Heaven, are such as to render pecuniary accommodation
presently necessary. - -
.The traitors in his Imperial Majesty's Kingdom of Lombardy refuse
his Imperial paper, money, and, will, for the present, only be paid in
bullion: this rebellious spirit drains his Imperial Exchequer, and, of
course, adds immensely to the expense of the vast armies which are
required to keep order in the rebellious provinces of North Italy. For,
if the rebels consented to receive notes of the Bank of Austria (which
has issues pretty much like those of the late celebrated Bank, of
Elegance in this City) in return for their produce, it is manifest that
the army of the gallant RADETZKY could be fed and clothed at a much
cheaper rate than at present. -
Mr. P., and several other influential Capitalists of the City of
London, would, therefore, have been glad to lend such a sum of ready
money as should enable his I. ºf R. Majesty to send into the
Lombardo-Venetian territory, a force that should set the paper-money
question at rest—that should be able to offer the Italians a choice of
paper or lead; and that should at once lessen the present, immense
charge to the empire of paying troops and de # with rebels in corn.
And, this .# got over, one currency (that of the Bank of Elegance)
§º established throughout the vast dominions of His Imperial
ajesty.
ne currency—one government—one truth—one faith—one Emperor
(accountable to Heaven only) are thus the advantages which, by a
little seasonable ready money, might be secured for the Empire.
As there is but one truth; it need be told but by one organ; and all
newspapers might be done away with.
As but one faith: Jews, Turks, Protestants, Infidels, &c., and their
pastors, must conform, or take the consequences.
One Government, and the humbug of Chambers, Diets, debates
votes, and rubbish, might be put an end to. Newspaper bickerings and
palavers of local assemblies cause half the embarrassments of Govern-
ment. , Books propagate most of the errors which inflame weak and
wicked minds. Books, newspapers, and local assemblies being abolished,
the course of Government would be clearer, and infinitely less costly.
Had the Hungarians never debated, they would never, have j;
and never have been punished; and the expensive Russian would never
have been called in. Had MADAME DE MADERSBACH never been able
to read, she would not have had wrong thoughts; she would not have
been flogged. What money, what blood might have been spared! No.
Let there be one currency; one government, one newspaper, , one
catechism of politics and religion, and one finperor—accountable to
Heaven, of course.
What efforts will not Herr Punch and all right-minded men take to
secure these desirable ends: what an Elysium will the Austrian empire
be when these ends are secured.' . And why are there not offices open
in London where English capitalists might exchange their money for
Austrian Paper? -
Mr. Punch entreats His Excellency the Austrian Minister to accept
the assurances of his most profound consideration.

PALMER'S LEGS,
N American gentleman, named
PALMER, having lost
one of his own lower
limbs, has invented a leg,
with which he walks as
well, dances as well, rides
film.
- ||||In
| III º as well, kicks as well, as
Tū with the original member.
| |
|\|
| |\
l We hear that bushels of
legs are ordered for Chel-
sea and Greenwich Hos-
pitals; and that the ser-
vices are very much
annoyed, because persons
losing a limb will not be
pensioned in future, but
will be refitted and sent
back to active duty in
their ships and regiments.
ADMIRAL LOPP and
Colonel HoPPER, C.B.,
at the United Service
Club, have expressed
their determination to
have each his leg taken
off (the Admiral suffering
much from gout, and the
Colonel, who is still the
dandy of 1815, from a
tight boot and corns), and
to wear nothing but Ame-
- rican legs for the future.
A council of footmen has been held at the Wheel of Fortune, MR. JEAMEs in the chair.
Several gentlemen who are out of place, and thin about the calves, have expressed their
determination to amputate against the season, and are going into the Saint George's Hospital
forthwith. It is thought that families requiring tall footmen, will be better pleased to have
uniform legs behind a carriage, than the unequal calves, the thick ankles, and the unartificial
stuffing, which so often disgrace the footboards of the aristocracy.
The Corps de Ballet is much excited. Miss BANDINELLI talks about chloroform and the
knife, which a young Surgeon oftGuy's offers to employ gratis; Mesdemoiselles KNox,
CBooksHANKS, SPINDLE, and LANKY propose to remedy the defects of nature by having
recourse to this admirable American artist.
Indeed, MR. PALMER thinks that he can perfect his invention, and construct not only
legs, but whole bodies, which will perform Fº execute pirouettes, entrechats, and so
forth; sigh, grin, pant, leer, and ogle, as well as the very best coryphées. And we hear that
Mr. Luºy is in treaty for six dozen of these danseuses, which will perform in the ballets
perfectly: which, after the first º: will cost the enterprising lº nothing: which
will never quarrel, tattle, or use bad language behind the scenes: which, if they sprain their
ankles, can be mended easily, in ten minutes, by the Carpenter of the Theatre: which will
not lead young noblemen and men of fashion astray: and which, if wanted, can be hired out
for parties to Greenwich, Richmond, &c., perfectly dressed, and capable even of taking cham-
*::: lobster-salad, &c., as well as the present ornaments of the Terpsichorean stage.
d they will not grow old, thin, fat, *:::: as the best of the living machines must do:
and when gentlemen are tired of them, can be put away without any inconvenience.
THE DIGNITY OF MILITARY SURGERY,
As Estimated at Head Quarters.
THERE is, a certain mean, worthless, despicable set of fellows, who have never, until lately,
been treated with the scorn and indignity which they deserve.
These vile and infamous wretches get a disgraceful living by administering to the hard
exigencies of those distressed individuals who, ...h. by the misfortune of bodily
injury, or loss of health, are reduced to the necessity of seeking relief under their sufferings
from the resources of a paltry science, or of a low mechanical art. The caitiffs and miscreants
allud d to are, in common language, called physicians and surgeons, or medical men.
Medical men—if men a class so debased can properly be called—after a few years spent
in the easiest possible of studies—enter on a l; of idleness and freedom from anxiety,
called practice, in which nominal labours, of a menial character, are attended with immense
remuneration. -- -
The “practice,” as it is termed, of the degrading employment styled the “Medical
Profession,” is the dirtiest of all possible work, and is pursued altogether from the equally
sordid desire of gain. Hence it is that the followers of that ignoble avocation are regarded
in º odious and contemptible a point of view by persons who pretend to be high-minded
gentlemen.
A vulgar Public, it is true, from a *::::: of selfishness, entertains a certain sort of respect
for these fellows, out of consideration for the magnitude of the humiliating services which they
render to society.
The spirit of military chivalry, however, has a proper sense of their dishonourable position.
From the head-quarters of that loſty sentiment—from the Horse Guards itself—has issued an
order, commanding that the army medical officers shall henceforth perform the duty of
In the Russian service, the surgeons are com-
pelled to act as barbers to the troops; but the
more barbarous task which has been allotted to
our own military surgeons, shows the authorities
at the Horse Guards to have improved very con-
siderably upon the Cossack idea of the dignity
of the “medical profession.”
Probably a course of studies under MR. CAL-
CRAFT, with a view to acquiring proficiency in
the application of the cat and the halter, will
soon be prescribed as a necessary element in the
education of the British army-surgeon.

ected; but, as nothing has been expected of the
ridge, this is not saying much for the state of
its health. - - -
Blackfriars Bridge has been sinking for some
time past. There was a rumour that it was getting
stronger, and would soon be able to rise from its
bed; but we have learned that, unfortunately,there
is not the slightest foundation for the rumour.
BARBER BEAUMONT's Pump in Piccadilly has
been laid up now for the last month, and, what
is worse, gives but little hopes of mending. It
still carries its handle in a sling.

The Punch Office still shows the same extraor-

AUSTRIA’S
FRIENDS IN THE CITY.
RECENT City, article
of the Times, in
reference to the
new Austrian
loan, says that
“The Roman Ca-
tholic prelates have,
it is alleged, deter-
Inined to subscribe
to the extent of all
the available means
of the convents;
and the principal
Jews have also
been influenced to
‘recommend' all
of their profession
- to subscribe libe-
º rally.”
And why not?
Is not money
like any other
commodity? Am
Ito be debarred
from selling £. s. d., because my customer is
likely to make a bad use of the article, &c.?
Must, I decline to export iron, because a
despot might have fetters made of it, to chain
patriots together withal—or cotton cloth, be-
cause it might serve an absolute prince for a
nightcap, &c., &c., &c.; - -
Well, my commercial moralist, suppose you
- have the right to supply a tyrant with the
sinews of war on human liberty; suppose your conscience need be
disturbed by no such reflections, as that every penny you lend may
be a bullet, for a true heart, a knot in a scourge for a woman's back,
&c, &c. Let all that pass;–there are other points in question. . .
Are the Jews recommended to subscribe liberally to the Austrian
loan as a good investment merely? -
Is it simply as usurers that the Roman Catholic prelates have deter-
mined to devote all the available means of the convents to the same
purpose?
§ the Jews be likely to expedite their emancipation by lending
their money expressly to abet the EMPEROR of AUSTRIA! -
Will the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, by pressing, the cash of their
Church into the Austrian service, gain any additional credence for their
constant assertion that they are merely a spiritual, and not a political
organisation, and by no means hostile to human liberty, and not at all
desirous of confining the intellect and enslaving the soul?

THE NATION AND ITS MONUMENTS.
THE National Gallery holds its place
In Trafalgar's noble Square,
And being a national disgrace,
Will remain forever there.
The Duke on the Arch was raised, in spite
Of all that the world could say;
And because he stands on an awkward site,
We of course shall let him stay.
The Palace of Glass is so much admired,
Both in Country and in Town,
That its maintenance is by all desired :
So we mean to pull it down.
The Flower of Politeness.
THERE is now growing, at a nursery-ground in Chelsea, a Victoria
Regia, so gigantic as nearly to fill up the garden. A person of cere.
monious habits, in passing the flower, put it gently aside, exclaiming at
the same time, “Now then, by your leaf.”
ANOTHER AND ANOTHER STILL.
THE novel cable just prepared for the Electric Telegraph may justly
be called the greatest curiosity in-new—rope—(in Europe).

PANORAMA OF THE INGLESE—AN INGLESE
FAMILY.
(From the Beyrout Banner, Joppa Intelligencer, and Jerusalem Journal.)
THE renowned and learned Sage and Doctor of Beyrout, the excellent
HADJEE ABoo Bosh, has just returned to his beloved country from his
wonderful travels in distant lands, having visited most of the cities and
people of Franghistan. He is familiar with all languages, and has
deeply studied the customs and manners of the Infidels. He has caused
skilful limners amongst them, at the expense of many millions of
piastres, to paint pictures representing the chief towns of the Franks;
which, works are so wonderful, life-like, and resembling nature, that
true Believers, without leaving the cushion of repose, or the pipe of
meditation, may behold the towns of Europe presented before them,
and have the mountains to come to them, which would not advance in
former ages, no, not even to meet the Prophet.
The famous and skilful HADJEE has arranged, near the Bazaar, by
the Rope-makers' quarter, in the large vacant hall formerly occupied by
the baths of EI. THAwer, a vast chamber, in which he exhibits the
wonders which he has brought from foreign countries. Having paid
money to a negro at the door, you are introduced through obscure
passages into a chamber as dark as Gehemma, and into a place which
they call, a pit, where you sit in expectant terror, before an awful
curtain, lighted but by a few faint lamps.
Many of the stoutest Agas and Effendis in Beyrout entered this
ſº apartment not without awe. The women of the hareem of
AP90SH PASHA were placed in a box, guarded by a gilt cage; as were
the ladies of the establishment of BLUEBEARD BEy, and the three wives
of the GRAND MoLLAH. Women's curiosity, indeed, will go any-
where. As the poet has sung—
Ther * º secret so dark, but the eye of ZUTULBE will pene-
rate lit.
There is no tangled skein, but the finger of LEILA will unravel it.
There is no lock so cunning, but the crooked nose of the old hag,
FATIMA, will pick it.
—Indeed, a vast audience of the officers, lords, and topping merchants
of Beyrout were present to behold the ABoo Bosh's wonderful
pictures.
Before the curtain drew aside, and our eyes were dazzled, our ears
were diverted by a dexterous slave, who executes the barbarous music of
Europe, favourite songs of the unbelievers, by merely turning
the handle of a small chest, called a Hurridee Gurridee. The handle
operates upon a number of bulbuls who are confined within the box,
each of whom at his signal comes forward and pipes in his turn. One
sings the hymn of the French Feringhees; he is called the Parees Yenn:
when he is tired, another warbles the war-song of the English; he is
called the Roolbretawnia: this over, a third nightingale begins to pipe
the delicious love-song of the Yangkees, who are a kind of Ingleez, and
the name of this songbird is Yangkeedoodool. The sweetest of all the
songs is this, and fills the heart with delight.
hen the birds are tired, he who turns the handle of the box stops
turning, and the music ceases with a melancholy wail. And then, as
in a blaze of splendour, the pictures begin to pass before the astonished
beholders.
The city represented yesterday was the City of Lundoon, which lies
upon a river called the Tameez: over which are twenty thousand
bridges, each twenty hundred parasangs in length, and to which there
come daily a hundred thousand ships.
In one quarter of Lundoon, during the winter months, it is always
night. It is illuminated, however, with fire, which gushes out of the
bowels of the earth, and affords a preternatural brilliancy. This
quarter is called Stee; twenty, thousand carriages rush thither every
minute, each carriage holding forty persons: the drivers and grooms
crying out Stee, Steel In this quarter the Shroffs and principal
merchants reside. The palace of the LoRD CADI is here, and each
ward of the City has an Elderman: who becomes Cadi in his turn.
They are all fat in this district, drinking much of an intoxicating liquor
made of citrons and rakee, called Panj, or Poonj, and eating of a stew
of tortoises, of which they take many platesfull...ABoo Bosh owned to
having tasted and liked the stew, but about the liquor he was silent.
After seeing the Merchants’ quarter, the view changed, and exhibited
to us the great Mosque of Paul, whereof the dome is almost as high as
Mount Lebanon. The faithful pay two paras, to enter this Mosque;
which sum goes to the support of the dervishes. Within, it is sur.
rounded by white images of captains, colonels, and effendis; whose
figures show that the Ingleez were but an ill-favoured people. In the
court is an image of a beloved Queen: , the people say “QUEEN ANN
is dead,” and tear their beards to this day, so much do they love her
memory.
The next view was that of the building in which the Councillors and
men of law of the kingdom meet for their affairs. In all Stambool
there is not such a palace. It is carved without, and gilt within. The
Chambers of Council are endless, the chair of the QUEEN is a treasure

of splendour; and ABoo Bosh says, that when she comes in state, and
surrounded by her vizeers, this intrepid Sovereign of an island race,
that governs provinces more vast and distant than Serendib and Hind,
always carries in her arms three lions. But the Hadjee did not see the
QUEEN, of THE INGLEEz, and I doubt of this story.
Besides the Mosque of Paul, there is the Mosque of Peter, whereof
we likewise saw a view. All religions are free in this country, but only
one is paid. Some dervishes shave the top of their heads, some tighten
a piece of white cloth round their necks, all are dressed in blackºwe
saw pictures of these, as also of the common people, the carriages, the
QUEEN's janissaries in scarlet, with silver caps on their heads, and
cuirasses made of a single diamond. These giants are all ten feet high :
their officers fifteen : it is said that each consumes a sheep, and drinks
a barrel of wine in the day.
A Boo then showed us the triumphal arch, near to the house of WEL-
LINGTOON, PASHA, who has but to look from his window and see his own
image on horseback. Ten thousand images of WELLINGTOON are placed
about the town, besides: the English being so proud of him, because he
conquered the French JENERAL BoonAPooBT. But lovers of poetry
know the opinion of the bard:—
The vietory is not always with the bravest: nor the robe of honour
given to him who deserves most.
An eagle is shot down, and a leopard runs away with the spoil.
Near this is the Maidaun, where the young lords and ayas ride, with
nymphs as beautiful as those of Paradise, arrayed in tight-fitting robes,
and smiling from prancing chargers.
And now came a buzz of wonder, in the crowd, and outcries of
delight from the women's boxes, which made the eunuchs move about
briskly with their rattans, when the wonderful
#: us, representing the prodigious Castle of Crystal, and pavilion of
It is many miles long, and in height several furlongs. It is built of
rock crystal and steel, without putty, wood, bricks, or nails. , Qn the
walls are flags, in number one º and seventy-eight, thousand.
We said “Praise to Allah!” when we saw the scarlet standard, with
the crescent and star of our august master, ABDUI, MEDLID.
This palace was built in a single night an enchanter named
Paxtoon. This wonderful man possesses all the secrets of mature; he
can make a melon in ten minutes grow as big as a camel, a rose spread
out before your eyes to the size of an umbrella. Lately, in a convent of
dervishes, he caused in one evening a cabbage to grow so big, that
after hearing a sermon from one of their Mollahs, who got up into the
boughs, axes were brought, the plant was felled, and the whole com-
munity dined off it; several bursting with repletion, so delicious was
the food. . This was told ABoo Bosh by a Mollah of Birmingham, a
twisting dervish, who had seen many wonders.
Having seen the exterior of this Hall of Light, ABoo Bosh now showed
to us the wondrous interior. All the treasures of the world are there
surely. Ten hundred and ten thousand persons come thither daily, and
they all go first to see the saddles and embroidery, from Beyroot.
What arcades of . splendour ! what fountains! what images! The
tallest trees grow in this palace. The birds cannot fly to the roof: it is
so high. At one end, is a place where travellers are served with cakes
and sherbet by ravishing houris, with moon faces. O, ABoo! O,
HADJEE, I suspect that FATIMA, your one-eyed wife, has not heard the
end of those tales! What says the poet?
The best part of the tale is often that which is not told.
A woman’s truth is like the cloth which the Armenian sells you in
the bazaar: he always cribs a portion of it.
And now, having spent several hours in examining this picture, the
bulbul-box was again set in motion, and the greatest curiosity of all
was represented to us. This is an Ingleez family of distinction, whom
AB00 Bosh has brought with him, and who will be exhibited every day
at three hours before, and three hours after sunset. But the account
of their strange behaviour shall be reserved for the next Intelligence.
The Greatest Miracle of all !
Roman Catholic priests are very fond of boasting of their wonderful
miracles; but there is one miracle which they have never yet been able
to accomplish. They have been trying at it for a wearisome number of
.." least, they pretend they have; but hitherto their holy efforts
ave not been attended with the slightest success. The miracle we
allude to, as still waiting for fulfilment, is no less than
THE PACIFICATION OF IRELAND !
When Ireland is restored to peace and quietness, such as England
enjoys, and restored, too, by the pious agency of Roman Catholic
priests, we shall look upon the happy realization as the º miracle
of all Roman Catholic miracles, and shall almost be prepared to
believe in winking statues, bleeding pictures, St. PETER's Chair, St.
JANUARIus's blood, and enormous cabbages—even though the cab-
es may be larger, and have as much leart in them, as CARDINAL
WisemAN's sanctity!
icture dawned
THE RAILWAY TRAVELLER'S FAREWELL TO
HIS FAMILY.
'Twas Business call’d a Father to travel by the Rail;
His eye was calm, his hand was firm, although his cheek was pale.
He took his little boy and girl, and set them on his knee;
And their mother hung about his neck, and her tears flowed fast and free.
I’m going by the Rail, my dears—ELIza, love, don’t cry–
Now, kiss me both before I leave, and wish Papa good-bye.
I hope I shall be back again, this afternoon, to tea,
And then, I hope, alive and well, that your Papa you’ll see.
I’m going by the Rail, my dears, where the engines puff and hiss;
And ten to one the chances are that something goes amiss;
And in an instant, quick as thought—before you could cry “Ah!”
An accident occurs, and—say good-bye to poor Papa!
Sometimes from scandalous neglect, my dears, the sleepers sink,
And then you have the carriages upset, as you may think.
The progress of the train, sometimes, a truck or coal-box checks,
And there’s a risk for poor Papa's, and everybody’s necks.
Or there may be a screw loose, a hook, or bolt, or pin,
Or else an ill-made tunnel may give way, and tumble in;
And in the wreck the passengers and poor Papa remain -
Confined, till down upon them comes the next Excursion-train.
If a policeman’s careless, dears, or if not over-bright,
When he should show ared flag, it may be he shows a white;
Between two trains, in consequence, there’s presently a clash,_
If poor Papa is only bruised, he’s lucky in the smash.
Points may be badly managed, as they were the other day,
Because a stingy Company for hands enough won’t *:
Over and over goes the train—the engine off the rail,
And poor Papa's unable, when he’s found, to tell the tale.
And should your poor Papa escape, my darlings, with his life,
May he return on two legs, to his children and his wife,
With both his arms, my little dears, return your fond embrace,
And present to you, unalter’d, every feature of his face.
I hope I shall come back, my dears—but, mind, I am insured,—
So, in case the worst may happen, you are so far all secured.
An action then will also lie for you and your Mamma,
And don't forget to bring it—on account of poor Papa.
MAZZINI.
ccording to the authentic reports of the
continental papers, SIGNOR MAzzINI—
albeit in England—continues to be the
prime disturber of the peace of the
world.
The matter is not yet thoroughly
searched to its head, but, we fear, there
now remains but little doubt that the
late earthquake in the Kingdom of
Naples originated in the dark mind of
the triumvir. His Majesty KING FER-
DINAND has been heard to express him-
self very decidedly upon the point.
Galignani — that original and high-
principled journal—laments the banish-
ment of families from the sky of Paris:
all the fugitives being victims to “MAz-
ZINI-ISM.” There can be no doubt that
the late descent upon Cuba originated
s from the same cause; and should the
plague break out, within the next ten
years in Constantinople, the pest will
inevitably be Mazzini in his worst
virulence.
We would advise the authorities of
our happy country to be upon their guard. Lord PALMERSTON is
jºy over-frank and confiding. A great proportion of the
#: crop is gone in Ireland. We make no accusation; but we must
ope that MAZZINI will not ultimately be found at the root of the matter.
“Latet Anguis in,” &c., &c.
THE Pope is so well known at Rome for the extreme, slipperiness of
his dealings, that some heretical wag has been scribbling over the
door of the Vatican the following inscription:—“THE CELEBRATED
ORIGINAL EEL-PIUs!”

PIECEs may have long runs without any fatigue to themselves—how-
ever tiring they may be to the audiences—but when we hear of a horse
having had a run for 83 consecutive nights, we begin to wonder the
%. creature has a leg to stand upon. We perceive that our old friend
azeppa is still upon his legs at Astley's, after having “urged on his
wild career” without interruption since the beginning of June last.
When the poor brute became sensible that the drama was henceforth
to be his peculiar walk, he never could have calculated on a run of such
duration. Since the introduction of railways and omnibuses, few horses
are brought up to the stage, and the stage of Astley's seems to be the
most arduous stage of an animal’s existence.
Though the poor creature was sane enough when he commenced
delineating the arduous character of the “Wild Horse of the Desert,” we
can readily believe that he has been driven wild at last by over-exertion;
and the insanity that used to be once feigned, may have become at last
natural. Like the maniac in the song, he may now exclaim, with
terrible earnestness—“ º: we driven me mad!” No horse can stand
such continual nagging as this one has been subject to.
The French President and the French Press.
ALMost every day brings its triumph to Louis NAPOLEoN over the
French press. He has a nest of singing-birds, all in a cage., . As the
Tyrian dye is a lost, secret, so hopes the President to make his world
forget the printers' black. In a few years, with the nephew of his uncle
at the Elysée, men will have retrograded to scribes and parchment. In
the meantime, a monument is to be erected to the glory of the President.
And as NAPoleoN had statues of himself cast from the cannon he had
captured, so will Louis NAPOLEoN have a colossal figure cast from the
types he has made waste metal. As the spoil of twenty battles was
molten for the glory of the Emperor, so will the lead of twenty news-
papers commemorate the reputation of the President.
LONDON POLITENESS.
The Glasgow Eraminer has been to London, and has returned to
Glasgow delighted with a sense of London politeness. He never heard
a rude word in our streets: he never saw “a drunken person in
London,” All our cabmen are pinks of gentility—our cads would pass
for noblemen. In fact, all London society, like a cabinet-pudding, is
covered with sweet sauce; but then, the Cabinet itself, is a great cause
of this; for, says Eraminer,
“In London the people are accustomed to see HER MAJESTY and Her Majesty's
Ministers and advisers moving about among them, and they learn to respect them-
selves, and to avoid all rudeness and insolence, but too common in the provinces.”
Eraminer has pounced upon the cause of our good-breeding. Our
d little QUEEN bows and smiles us into gentleness, and the QUEEN’s
inisters, “moving about among us” in all directions, have a beni
influence upon the crowd. Godwin has well said, speaking of the
universal operation of SHAkspeaRE, that even a Chinese Mandarin may
be in some sort humanised by the poet, even though he shall never
have heard of him. And, in like manner, many an English coalheaver

TAMISIER.
UNCH has had his attention
called to certain miracles
performed in this country by
a young lady, which are
quite as remarkable as those
of MADEMoise LLE TAMI-
| SIER, and a good deal more
credible. e feels certain
that, after hearing them, the
reader will no longer trouble
himself about Rose, but will
exclaim with HoRACE,
“Mitte sectari, Rosa quo locorum
Sera moretur,”
and withdraw his attention
from her at once.
The young lady's name is
ELLEN B–. From her
childhood there has been
something peculiar about her
appearance; a strange lustre
of eye, and a peculiar tint
and form of mouth, which
marked her as one destined
by fortune to make some im-
pression in the world. While
a child, it was observed that
people loved to take her in
their arms. Nay, when only
mine, she cast a glance at a
..". gentleman, a friend
of the family, the effect of which was to make him abandon his hoop,
and quite withdraw for a time from his usual sports. And whereas
the only thing, miraculous about the youth, previously, was the
romptitude with which he converted pieces of copper into º:
#. turned his lollipops into gall; into gall, we say, advisedly, for he
rejected them contemptuously, and, soon after, burst out crying. How
did she achieve this last result? Simply, by taking her parasol (she
has been known to do wonders with that instrument), and walking
away from the door, homewards!
But it was when Miss ELLEN.B— returned from school, aged
seventeen years and six months, that the exercise of her miraculous
powers became most noticeable. - -
Statues have been said to wink on various occasions; but what was
the effect of ELLEN on a block—head in H-Street f She caused,
by simply coming into the room, the mouth of this odd figure to
partially open, j its eyes to roll—producing a degree of expression
in the #: of which no one believed, it capable ! And the wooden
figure in question afterwards would “imitate,” or nod—in what was
conceived to be intended for a knowing manner—at the mere mention
of her name ! -
Rose TAMIsIER awoke a youth, we are told, through the medium of
her guardian angel. But it is a well-known fact that our ELLEN-b
her mere influence, unseen, and absent—kept awake all night a yout
from Oxford, who had met her at an evening party. The same youth,
when he returned home, on that very evening assured his sister most
firmly that he had seen an angel. , This is a fact to which dozens of his
friends are willing to depose; indeed, his reiterated assurances of it had
become rather a bore. When asked what sort of a figure it was, he
replied—“A gentle, stately figure, with dark hair, and deep blue eyes.”
There can be no doubt that it was to the influence of ELLEN B– that
we must attribute his belief in that apparition. .
ELLEN had Visions; and these were very variously represented—and
misrepresented by some people, ladies, generally, we believe. Some
were wont to assert that she saw visions of herself, with her head
encircled by a halo in use among the English aristocracy on state occa-
sions, and called a coronet: that she loved to see herself in the state of
vision, encircled with a small kind of golden crown, bearing five pearls.
Others add that she fancied herself borne along in a sumptuous chariot.
But it is vehemently asserted by others that all her visions were of
objects of real beauty and purity. - -
umberless were the phenomena which this young female produced.
Her name appeared on the bark of trees, how put there, nobody
knew. Tears, visions, bleeding hearts, were the ordinary results of her
miraculous doings. If the TAMIsIER did wonders with cabbages,
ELLEN sometimes prevented people from dining at all. -
Such was—or rather is -our countrywoman, ELLEN B–, a rival
of Rose TAMIsIER herself, and assuredly the cause of much rivalry in
others,

MERE CHILD’s PLAY.-The Performances of the BATEMAN Infants

A PRETTY KETTLE OF TEA ''
“PUNCH, Elysian Farm, Sept., 1851.
...“In my celebrated work, called “Cottage Economy, of which
fifty million copies were sold in this country, and twice that number
in America, I some very sensible observations on the subject of
that, ruinous and detestable stuff, tea. proved to demonstration
‘that it contains nothing nutritious;, that it, besides being good for
nothing, has badness in it, because it is well known to produce want of
sleep in many cases, and in all cases to shake and weaken the nerves.”
But, notwithstanding the t amount of information that I possessed
qn every subject, I little knew how much badness the body and soul
destroying tea-trash contains, although my wonderful sagacity gave me
an inward persuasion that the quantity of the Poison must be immense.
And so, indeed, it turns out. Read the Lancet, and make your wife
and your daughters read it too, if they can be induced to rea anythin
but foolish novels and unmeaning poetry. There they will see wit
what a delicate beverage they wash down their dainty slices, or
rather, shavings, of bread-and-butter. Prussian blue, indigo, turmeric
powder, China clay, Chinese yellow, soap-stone, catechu—these are some
of the less, loathsome of the filthy drugs, and virulent and deadly
Poisons, with which your tea, nasty and pernicious as it is in itself, is
adulterated. Black lead, vegetable red, and carbonate of lime or chalk,
are enumerated in the list of abominations; and the Times, in com-
menting on the Lancet’s disclosures, says that, in a particular sort of
this tea-rubbish “there were found little lumps’ resembling what
ladies, who fritter away their time in keeping silk-worms, would
recognise as the sweepings of those insects' cages. Other nice messes
consist of what is called “lie tea;' which is a hodge-podge of tea-dust
and sand, made up with rice-water; a very fit mixture, with a ve
suitable name, too, this ‘LIE TEA, to enliven a party of scandal.
mongering old crones of an evening.
“As, to what is called green tea, the greenness is a mere dye, com-
municated by Poison. The stuff, moreover, sold as tea, is, in many
cases, no such thing, but a parcel of leaves of the beech, elm, horse-
chestnut, plane, oak, willow, poplar, hawthorn, and sloe, which, how-
eyer, I should say, are rather more wholesome than the thing which
they are meant to counterfeit. Mixtures, indeed, called “La Veno
Beno” (whatever that means), and "The Chinese Botanical Powder,’
composed of sumach-leaves, wheat flour, and catechu, are sold under
the name of “tea-improvers,’ and may improve the tea for aught I
know. The commonest piece of tea-dealers' rascality, however, is that
of mingling with the ‘genuine’ Chinese weed re-dried tea-leaves, and
these are ‘faced,’ to give them “a bloom,’ with black lead, as grates
are ‘faced; or they are ‘faced’ with rose pink, or vegetable red and
chalk, exactly as a ‘bloom,’ when wanting, is imparted by “facing,” to

these tea-leaves would be preferable to any other, for the badness has,
at least, been pretty well stewed out of them. It is right that the
reader, and especially the lady reader, should know that they are prin-
cipally bought up of charwomen, whose perquisites they become, when
those old cormorants are employed in a ‘genteel establishment” to
clean up the furniture, and scrub the floor, owing to the piggish indo:

her lolloping daughters.
“A play-writer of the name of SHAKSPEARE, I think, in a Scotch
farce, called Macbeth, represents three old witches as compounding a
diabolical mess, of which the ingredients are too nasty to be specified;
but I will venture, to say that the cauldron of those hags contains
nothing half so horrid as the contents of the teapot, which certain others
are accustomed to croak and mumble over. I would not have been so

This is the drench in which your teetotallers would have us steep our

a less injurious habit than such guzzling as this. Bad as spirituous
liquors are, they are not so bad as Prussian blue and black lead, which
are worse than any spirits that inhabit the Shades in a quarter entirely
remote from the abode of

The Crystal Palace for Ever!
WE read that certain pawnbrokers have of late received bushels of
watches from people pledging them for money to visit the Exhibition.
That watches should be disposed of for such a purpose is a significant

all time.

PUNCH'S ANNIVERSARIES.—No. 6, THE FIRST BALL00N ASCENT IN
ENGLAND, SEPTEMBER 15th, 1784.
WINCENT LUNARDI THROWING OUT A LITTLE BALLAST.
THE HIPPOPOTAMUS, THE ELEPHANT, AND THE URAN UTAN.
WE perceive by the announcements in the papers, that the little jealous differences be:
tween the Hippopotamus, and the Infant Elephant are made up, and that all professional
rivalry being set aside, they are advertised as exhibiting together in the Regent's Park.
This is as it should be, and sets an example to other public performers, which the latter
would do well to imitate.
Mr. STENTor will often refuse to play, Richmond to the Duke of Gloucester, of MR.
Leatherlungs, and thus Richard the Third cannot be performed efficiently, thqugh at the
Zoological Gardens we have the º: appearing in conjunction not only with the
Elephant, but side by side also with the Uran, Jian-known familiarly as the Ourangotang.
Considering the length of time during which the Hippopotamus led the business, and gambolled
making a long stay, the Hippopotamus has wisely
determined to smother all ill-feeling, and share
the public favour with the new comer. The
conduct of both towards the Uran Utan is
beyond all praise, for they seem to have asked
themselves, “Is he not an Ourangotang and a
brother?” and answering the question in the
affirmative, they have established, a state of
liberty, equality, and fraternity, which is quite
delightful to contemplate.
MODERN SEA-SONG.

Let it stand a little on;
Then we will settle on
Our beam-ends to tea.

And bring the bohea.
Hand the cream; now, pray, take care;
A hand, too, with the teapot bear;
And if you’ve the slop-basin there,
Pass it to me.
British sailors have a knack
Qſ,swigging down the green and black,

A SERIOUS DIFFERENCE OF DOCTORS.
THE London Pharmacopoeia, just published,
differs, rather widely, in some important points
from that of Edinburgh and Dublin. The Winegar
of Colchicum of the Dublin is three times as
strong as the same compound as prescribed in the
London and Edinburgh. The strength of the
Winegar of Opium in the Edinburgh is thrice what
it is in the Dublin. The Edinburgh's Prussic
Acid is twice stronger than the London and
Dublin's; and the solutions of Hydrochlorate of
Morphia and Acetate of Morphia of the London,
bear the same º to those of the Dublin
and Edinburgh. these particular medicines
are dangerous or fatal except in very small doses,
the chances against a patient who has the mis.
fortune to be prescribed for, according to one
Pharmacopoeia, and compounded for according to
another, may very possibly be three, or two to
one; a consideration, which cannot but suggest
the remark, that what is one man's physic, may
be another man's poison.
The Truth is hard, but must be told.
ENGLAND has been called “a Nation of Shop-
keepers.” Since the frightful revelations, how-
ever, of the Lancet, by which it has been proved
that nine out of every ten tradesmen in London
sell articles that are most poisonously adulterated,
it would seem that we are not only a “Nation
of Shopkeepers,” but something more. In fact,
if these dishonest practices are persevered in,
we are afraid that some new NApoleon — a
NAPOLEoN of Truth—will arise, and very politely
tell us, “You are not only A NATION or Shop-
KEEPERs, BUT OF Rogues ALsol"

SMOKE-COMMUNICATION WITH AUSTRALIA.
THE ears of the delicate are
sometimes shocked by a cer-
tain vulgar, but expressive
phrase, namely, “to choke
off.” It is a metaphorical form
of speech, evidently borrowed
from the vocabulary of the
sport called “canine:” and, in
its primary sense, denotes the
act by which a dog, in fight-
: or badger-baiting, is com-
pelled to let go his hold.
Such being the etymologi-
cal fact, the Admiralty issues
an advertisement for tenders
for a steam commumication to
Sydney, at intervals of two
months, by the Ca
Hope, at a speed of eight-
and-a-half knots per hour;
which advertisement, accord-
ing to the civic correspond-
ent of º “is º
upon in the City as simply
ridiculous,” as, probably, *
paragraph will be by those
who see a want of connexion
in it, and will not read on
for the explanation thereof.
But what act of the Admi-
ralty’s is not, and has not
been for some time, simply
ridiculous, and ridiculously
simple? Did they not build
war-steamers of cast-iron, without trying whether their rusty inven-
tions would stand shot? and is it not notorious that their expe-
rience of irony has alone deterred them from applying to the con-
struction of line-of-battle ships the materials of the Crystal Palace?
Nay, did they not, at one time, contemplate establishing a dockyard in
staffordshire, and building vessels of crockery - - -
To proceed, however—still keeping in view the point in etymology.
Facts and figures are not wanted here to prove the commercial
importance of the Australian colonies, and the necessity of a .
steam communication with them; so that it will, of course, be under-
stood that the absurdity of the Admiralty's advertisement only consists
in proposing a plan which would not at all answer the purpose. That
the wishes of the colonists ought to be consulted, must also be evident;
and, because the Antipodes are beneath our feet, there is no reason
why they should be trampled on. Whereas—the Times tells us–
“The public meetings of the colonists, which were almost confined to petitioning for
steam communication, and protesting against convict immigration, were answered by
steady obstruction in the former case, and, in the latter, by the intrºduction into Van
Diemen's Land, during the past year, of no less than 2894 criminals.”
This brings us back to the etymology of the phrase “To choke off.”
which, though derived from the inferior classes of society, evidently
expresses the intentions of Government towards our Australian colonies.
HERALDIG FRAGMENTS.
A Few incidental heraldic points are the fragments of this week’s
article—crumbs from our heraldic table. Our memory is semée of
. little facts, which we now bestow with due commentary on the
reader.
There are a few things used as “changes” very rarely; odd articles
of strange appearance—rarely “borne”-and, by-the-by, rather un-
bearable. Such are gal-traps, for example. The DRUMMONDs wear
“a mound semée with gal-traps.” One would fancy, from the name, that
these were a kind of fortune-hunting implements-devised to ensnare
incautious young ladies. Not so. They are, or, rather, were-for they
are now only known in Heraldry—weapons scattered about the field of
battle to wound horses. It is clear that they were very dangerously
useful. The enemies who came galloping up suddenly, found that they
had put their foot in it, with a vengeance!
The griffin, the heralds tell us with a very amusing candour, is a
“chimerical” creature. He is described “with large ears and no
wings.” But we are far from being sure that he is so very chimerical
after all—if these be his proper distinctive characteristics. , Poets and
politicians of the description are still found in Europe. And perhaps it
is some real modesty that induces people who have no right to arms, to
assume griffins, as they not unfrequently do. Pray be particular about
the ears, gentlemen! Punch begs it of you, as a favour.
of Good
Enhaunced, is a term used when any ordinaries are raised above their
usual position. By Ron bore “argent, three bendlets, enhaunced, gules”
—and very considerably he enhanced his family honours accordingly.
The reader will be surprised to hear that the homely “hedgehog” is
borne in this noble science of armorie. Qld GUILLIM, who, to do him
justice, is uncommonly ingenious in devising reasons for everything-
and who loved heraldic animals as an Arab does his horse—says, that
“the hedgehog signifies a man expert in gathering of substance.” If
this be true, the hedgehog ought to be borne a great deal more exten-
sively in this country—and, we may add, that the prickles of the animal
ought to be very distinctly defined—to signify how difficult it is to get
at the “substance” which our “expert” men gather.
A Cap of Maintenance is an honourable cap, of crimson velvet
generally. But a fool's cap might with propriety be called so, if it
maintained him as part of the furniture of his buffoonery. The cap of
maintenance is worn by nobility, and if the cap fits, of course they have
a right to wear it.
Is the public aware that “a cardinal’s hat, with strings, pendant and
plaited in true love knots, the ends meeting in base, paleº"—are the arms of
Sclavonia?—Happy country—so honoured—well known to be the
happiest and most enlightened in the world! Why does a miller wear a
white hat? is a question familiartous from the pages of Joe. But why
a cardinal wears a red one—is not, perhaps, so well known. The
miller does it, we are aware, to keep #. headwºrm, and nowadays it
would seem as if the cardinal did it to keep the country warm—i.e., in
hot water. But the orthodox answer is not so No. the
cardinal wears the red hat to signify that he “ought to shed his blood,
if required, in the defence of ecclesiastical liberty.”—Beautiful idea! Of
course, the red colour never typifies the blood of other people-nºver
symbolises, the episcopal claret. We have rarely seen a more tender
touch in all our experiences of blazoning, than the sweet motion of the
strings “plaited in true-love knots” (for which see CLARK's Heraldry,
f 105). It was positively the last notion that a cardinal's hat could
have suggested to us—or to anybody else, we fancy. How deliciously
the strings intertwine, like the tresses of the Babylonian lady! To be
sure, there are people—incapable of sentimen fresh from the
dungeons of Italy, and other fabulous places, who would believe rather
that they better symbolise—the ropes of the hangman and the knots of
whips. This would be too absurd. As well askus to believe GLADSTONE!
THE SCHOOLMASTER AT ST. ALBAN’S.
REATLY have we been delighted with
the intelligence from St. Alban's.
MR. Jacob BELL is an example to
M.P.s. He does not stalk his
recess in the Highlands; or throw
away himself at Baden-Baden. No:
he goes down to his own borough-
(whatever a man pays for ought to
be his own) — and, busy in the
interests of education, he examines
tº school-children: the little ones who,
* some day, will have the borough
at their own disposal. We hear
that many of the youngsters dis-
- º a marvellous precocity. Babes
- and sucklin icked out from
gingerbread alphabets the letters BRIBE AND COR-
RUPTION, eating the letters with a relish that delighted the hearts
of their parents. It was remarkable, too, that the letters thickest gilt
were soonest swallowed.
The “Court Newsman.” Corrected.
THE Court Newsman tells us that “the PRINCE of WALEs took his
usual exercise, attended by Mr. BIRCH.” We have authority for
adding that study is not altogether sacrificed to recreation, but that, at
a fitting period of the day, “the PRINCE of WALEs did his usual
exercise, superintended by Kin BIRCH.”
THE DUKE OF ATHOLL's shTLLING.
THE North British Mail assures us that the Duke of ATHoLL exacts
one shilling a head from every person taking a walk in his ground at
Dunkeld. This is rather dear; but the impost would be insupportable
if his Grace insisted upon also shewing himself for the money.
An Express Train for Ladies.
THE charms of English, ladies were formerly so irresistible, that
they enjoyed what is called “an European reputation” for sweeping
everything before them; but, at present, the only European reputation
which English ladies º is—thanks to their long dresses—of
sweeping everything behind them.

Now, as we all know what a very

for the strength of the structure that
it has not sunk long ago., . But few

THE FITZFUNKS IN FRANCE.
THE French. President, taking especial care that no harm shall come
to the Republic, has given orders for a general registry of that mis-
chievous and unprofitable body of people, the resident English in
la belle France. e feel humiliated by the knowledge of the fact that
a conspiracy did exist—it is now crushed, like the broken egg of a
cockatrice—to seize the person of Louis NAPOLEoN, and to convey it
far from France (the very island in the Pacific was confidentially named
as the future prison); and this diabolic plot—we blush again as we write
*...* in the circle of an English family! It would seem that
the hope, so darkly, fostered, of the conspirators, was to bring back
LEDRu Rollin at the very nick of the Presidential election. “ Rouge
pagne” was the secret password of the traitors! The plot had most
extensive ramifications, branching under the hearthstones of hundreds
of the English. Therefore, the President of the Republic can hardly be
accused of trepidation, in taking the strongest and most summary
means of defeating the conspirators. Let the reader, hasty to condemn
caution as pusillanimity, imagine hi f now snug in cotton (gun-
powder cotton) in the Elysée, an object of a people's love, and of the
embraces of the dames de la Hall, and—presto!—dropt upon an island
“far amid the melancholy main,” his rations raw turtle, cockles, and
cocoa-nuts!. For ourselves, friends of order, we heartily thank the
French President for his vigilance. We believe that he is every day
endearing himself to the ordained owners and masters of the human
race, the FRANCISEs, and WILLIAMs, and FERDINANDs, and NoNos.

in twenty years has learned just half his French, MRs. or MADAME FITz:
| FUNK—she was the daughter of an attorney at Tadcaster—is tout-à-fait
Française. Nevertheless, this respected family—(the FitzPUNKs have
had their house twice gutted by two revolutions,)—have been compelle
to wait a whole day at the gates of the Prefecture of Police to obtain
leave and permission to remain in Paris, to have, in the event of Revo-
lution No. 3, their household gods once more turned upon the paré. ...
MR, Fitzfunk has been required to arm himself with four humili-
ating documents., No. 1, a passport! No. 2, a certificate of residence,
duly attested by the benevolent Commissary of Police, residing in Fitz-
Fºk's quarter!, No. 3, a full and particular account of the means by
which he supports, himself and family; by funded property, or by the
ignoble sweat of his brow or brain. No. 4, a certificate that he is a
man of good conduct; moral, peaceable, and obedient to the law, as by
the President established.
º MR. FitzPUNK complied with these formalities; and was then
directed to go straight home and wait for a permis de séjour, a sort of
ticket, of residence; or for a notice to quit. For two days was the
household of the FitzPUNKs in the most alarming state of anxiety lest
they should not be permitted, by the benevolence of the government, to
remain and lay out their income upon the tradesmen .#Paris. Once

mildly requested her husband not to make a fool of himself, as the

AN
INGLEEZ FAMILY.
LL along, the Exhibition was explained to us
by a Frank Interpreter, who under-
stands perfectly our language.
Among the Ingleez, he said, men
are allowed but one wife: a hard
case, OAgas! for these poor women;
for as the bard has remarked—
“When I am in a queer temper,
in my hareem, I may beat ZULEIKA
with my slipper, but I smile upon
LEILA and Zutul BE.
“When LEILA’s fatness becomes
disagreeable, then Zutulbe's lean-
ness commences to be pleasing.
“When both annoy me, then little
ZULEIKA resumes her reign; for
strawberries ripen at one season of
the year, at another time figs, at
another time water-melons. But
always strawberries would be weari-
some; as to hear bulbuls all day
would cause one to yawn.
“Man takes delight in variety
as the bee sips of a thousand
flowers.”
So, for any poor creature to be
subject always to the caprices of
one man, is cruel on her; as to
compel one man to have but one
wife, as º the Ingleez, is a
tyranny unheard of amongst civilised
nations like our own; and we may
thank our stars that we do not live
in Lundoon, but Beyroot.
If all the old women among the
Ingleez are no better-looking than the
one whom ABoo Bosh showed to us,
I do not envy the elderly gentlemen
of that nation, and can quite under-
stand their habitual ill-humour.
In the first part of the play ap-
- peared this old woman, the Khanum of
the house, or “Misseez,” as the Interpreter says she is called; her two
daughters, LoLA and Lota; her son, the young Aga; and the Father of
the family, called BRowN EFFENDI.
BrowN EFFENDI is fifty-five or six years old. He is tall, and of a
portly shape, and, like all the elderly Ingleez, is bald: nor has he the
decency to cover, his baldness with a couple of caps, as we do, but
appears with his shining pate without any shame.
His wife is two or three years younger; they must have been
married these thirty years: no wonder that they quarrel together,
and that the Effendi is tired of such an old hag!
The Interpreter explains that it is the beginning of the day. A
table is set out, covered with a snowy damask cloth, with urns and
vases of silver for º of porcelain, one for each of the family
bits of roasted bread, hot cakes, meat, honey, and butter. This meal
the Ingleez of distinction take in common. An Effendi often does not
behold his family (always excepting the old hag of a wife) except at
that hour.
“Before the girls come down, and you go away to the Stee, MR.
Brown,” says the Misseez, “will you have the goodness to give me
some money? Look at these bills.”
ing. "Can't you let a man read his ºp per in quiet ’’
.O Allah! read his newspaper in quietſ. It is an immense sheet, as
big as the Capitan Pasha's mainsail. ...I should think it has as many
letters and lines as the Koran itself. The Interpreter says, every
Ingleez reads a paper every morning—it is called in their language,
El Tins—from beginning to end, every day, before going out. Praise
be to Heaven that we live in Beyroot!
“Well, don't swear at a woman, MR. B.,” she says; “don’t swear
when the children and servants are coming in. How can I help it, if
the house is expensive * I lived in a better, before I came to yours.
My mamma—”
‘Confound your mamma!. How much is it?” says Brown EFFENDI;
and drawing a paper from his pocket-book, he writes an order to his
Shroff to pay so much money.
The daughters now come in—there was a great sensation among us,
especially in that rogue who sate by me, Poor ALLEE, who is always on
the look-out for almond eyes. These virgins were young and fair, of
fine shapes seemingly, wearing a sort of loose gowns buttoned up to the
neck, with little collars, and little caps, with little ribbons; their
“Jehannum take the bills!” roars out BRowN, rising up and stamp-
cheeks pale, their eyes heavy—nevertheless, comely damsels, that
would fetch a round sum of piastres in the market.
“Why don't you come sooner?” growls the Father.
“They were at LADY Polk's, at MRs. WALLs's, and were not home till
four: the girls must have sleep, M.R. B.”
“Why do they go to those confounded balls?” asks Brown
EFFENDI. The Interpreter explains that a ball is a dance where
many hundred women assemble.
“They ought to be in bed at ten,” growls the House-father. -
“We do go to bed at ten, when there is nothing at night, papa,”
says . eldest. “We couldn't live if we didn't go to sleep on the
off nights.” |
“You don’t wish them not to go into the world, I suppose, MR. B.
You don't wish them not to #. establishments? You don’t suppose
it is for my pleasure that I go about night after night with these poor
things, whilst you are drinking with your male #. or at your
clubs?” (The Interpreter explains that a Club is the Coffee-house of
the Ingleez: they sit there smoking until late hours.) “You don't
". that I go to dances?”
RowN EFFENDI bursts into a laugh. “You dance, Polly!” says
he., “Do I suppose the cow jumped over the moon?”
“I wish Papa wouldn't use those expressions,” says Miss LoLA to
MIss LotA.
Papa now sits with his face buried in El Tims, and when he has read
it (only in this Exhibition, or play, of course, the actor did not read the
whole of the immense sheet, or we should have atti night)—this
labour over, and his breakfast done, he goes away to Stee.
“That is the commencement of the day with thousands of English
Effendis in Lundoon,” the lºº explains. “He rises at eight,
He shaves. He meets his family: kisses them, but rarely speaks,
except to swear a little, and find fault. He reads through El %. He
gives money to the Khanum. He goes to the Stee: where his
counting-house or office of business is, and which is often a long way
from his house. He goes on foot, while his wife has a chariot.”
“That I can understand,” says Poor ALLEE. “A man will not
allow his womankind to go out except in an Aroba, guarded by the
slaves. Even an unbeliever is not such a fool as that.”
“You are in error, O Effendi,” said the Interpreter. “The women
are free to go whithersoever they please. They wear no veils. They
go about the City unprotected, save by a male servant, and even he is
not, necessary. They, frequent the shops, and bazaars, and public
gardens. I have seen ten thousand in the $pring time basking in the
gardens of Kensington.
“O my eyes! I will go there,” said Poor ALLEE, stroking his beard,
that sly rogue.
“They are to be seen everywhere,” continues the Interpreter, “and
at home, too, receive men into their houses.”
... “This, I suppose, is one,” remarked a looker-on. “He is splendid; he
is tall; he has richly-carved buttons on his coat. He takes up the silver
urn. Is this an officer of the Sultaun ?”
“That P*
“That is a servant,” said the Dragoman. “He is bringing breakfast
for the young Effendi, who comes down later than the rest of the family.”
“That,” cried Poor ALLEE, “a servant? Why, he is a pearl of beauty.
He is a stum. He is strong, tall, young, and lovely. , Does an old
#. allow such an Antar as that to walk about in his Hareem?
Psha! friend Interpreter, you are joking.”
“It is even so, Sir,” said the Dragoman. “So i. is the pride
of certain classes of the Ingleez, and so barbarous—blasphemous, I had
almost said—their notions with regard to rank, that the aristocracy
among the Ingleez take no more account of the persons below them, than
your honour does of the black slave-boy who fills your pipe. And of
late, one of the lootees—or buffoons among the Ingleez—acquired no
small share of popularity, and received from his bookseller ten thousand
pieces of gold, for a book of jests, in which a servant was made the
principal hero, and brought to live among Lords and Agas—the point
of the jest being, that the servant was made to feel like a man.”
Here came in the young actor who, the Interpreter said, represented
the Son of the house. He drawled into the apartment, nodded
languidly to his sisters, kissed his mother's forehead, and sank into the
vacant chair by his sisters.
He called to the servant. “John!” he said, “pale ale.”
“My love!” said the Mamma. -
“Tell the cook to devil some dam thing,” continued the youth.
“My darling!” said the old lady. - -
“Hot coppers, Ma'am!” said the young man, pulling a little tuſt 0
hair on his chin. “Keep sad hours—know I do. Out on the crawl til
five o’clock this morning. Last thing I weckolect, shandy-gaff.”
“You’ll kill yourself, child!” cried Mamma. -
“So much the better for brother Dick. Youth is the season of
enjoyment. O dam what a headache I’ve got! “Gather ye roses
while ye may.’ Youth is the season of pleasure.”
“What sort of pleasure?” asked one of the sisters.
“Well—I think it was with two cabmen off the stand, at Bob
Cwoft's,” said the young man. “It’s not very good fun, but it’s

better than those dam balls that you go to every night. Here comes
the breakfast.”
And the curtain-bell ringing, the first part of the entertainment
Was OWer.
During the interval, the Interpreter continued to explain to us the
manners and customs of this queer pe? le: and the curtain again
rising, showed us a view of the Queen's Palace (before which there is
a figure of a Lion and Unicorn, which makes one die of laughing); the
Courts of Justice; the Castle of Windsor, which seems, indeed, a
º of splendour in a rose-garden of delight; and an immense hole
ored under the sea, the dark appearance of which made Poor ALLEE
shudder. And now, having seen the Ingleez in the morning, and heard
how the men pass the day in their offices and counting-houses, the
women in the shops buying, in their carriages, in the gardens, visiting
one another, and receiving company at home, the Dragoman said, “We
shall show them as they are dressed of an evening, expecting visitors
for the evening.”
The curtain drew up. BRowN EFFENDI was now dressed with a
white band round his neck, that made his eyeballs start out of his
head, and his red face blaze like the standard of the Sultan. MRs.
Brown appeared so changed since the morning, that you would not
know her, and Poor ALLEE (that rogue) said, “O my eyes! the old
woman to-night looks quite young, and I always liked a stout woman.”
They stood one on each side of the fire-place—the Interpreter said, in
the attitude of receiving dinner-company.
SchAUN, the servant, came in with a note on a silver salver.
“It’s from WAGG,” said BRowN EFFEND1–“d—n him " he says
he’s ill; but he’s asked by a lord, and has thrown us over. Take away
one cover, JoHN,” ... -
How splendidly attired now is this SchAUN!, His costume of the
morning is nothing to that which he now wears. A white coat barred
with gold lace; a waistcoat of red and gold: shulwars of § ush, the colour
of butter-cups—and has he grown grey since the morning? No, he has put
powder into his hair. He is beautiful to behold; a peacock is not finer.
And now, who enter? Who are these two houris? Who are these
moon-faced ones, with the lustrous ringlets, the round arms, the shining
shoulders? The heartbeats to behold them. Poor Airº's eyes brighten
with rapture. They are the damsels of the morning, LoLA and LotA.
“This is the habitof Ingleez damsels,” says the Interpreter, with rather
a sly look. “All day they cover themselves up, but at night, because it
is cold, they go with very little clothes. They are now § to dinneri
they will then go to a concert; they will then drive to a ball or dance.”
“But a ball, of course, only amongst women,” said his Excellency
PAPoosh PAshA, Governor of Beyroot, who was smoking his kaboon in
a box near the stage.
“Among women, excellent Sir! There are men, too. If there were
no men, the women would stay at home. This is the way that the
Ingleez——”
“Silence, shameless!”, roared out his Excellency. ... “KISLAR BEg!
Carry my women home this moment. Stop the Exhibition! All the
principles of morality are violated. Women in that dress show them-
selves to men l Never! or if they do, it can º be amongst barbarians,
and such a fact must not be known in a civilised country. HADIEE
ABoo Bosh! this part of the Exhibition must be no more represented,
under pain of the bastinado.”. And his Excellency flung out of the room
in a passion, and the Exhibition ended abruptly.
As for Poor ALLEE—that rogue—he has gone off to England by the
last Peninsular and Oriental steamer.
A BOLUS FOR BAD JUDGES.
REPORT, says it is intended by the College of Physicians, who are
daily making, such valuable contributions to science, to establish a
Chair of Psychological Therapeutics, or Medicine as applied to moral
and intellectual diseases. A malady which has recently exhibited itself
more conspicuously than usual in a sister profession, #. of the Law,
has, it is stated, occasioned the design. Judicial wisdom has lately
been doing its best to nullify LoRD, CAMPBELL's Act, by declaring it
cannot see how pecuniary compensation can be assessed for the loss-
by a wife or children—of the parent or husband who earn their bread,
and by whose loss they lose so much a year. Judicial wisdom, never-
theless, can estimate the amount of damages due for a broken heart,
when the breakage is involved in a breach of promise of marriage. It
sometimes, puts them at a rather high figure when the heart itself
is a mere fiction of law. It rates them, perhaps, at some hundreds of
pounds, when the heart alleged to have been broken is the hypothetical
property of a Miss fresh from a boarding-school, and the heart-breaker
a rich old fool. There is plainly, then, something the matter with
Judicial Wisdom. Its eyes are in fault. It can only see things by the
light of precedent. It is purblind, and squints. What a blessin
would be an extract or infusion of euphrasy, that should purge .
purify it to a sound vision! To discover some such remedy, and other
cures for ailments of the inner senses, is the object of the College of
Physicians in establishing the Chair of Psychological Therapeutics. A
learned professor of that branch of science. has already, it is said,
invented some Prejudice Pills, and Emollient Pectorſ Ointment;
strongly recommended by the faculty to their legal brethren, and
especially to the elder members of the Bench and the Bar, , whose
fallacies have become chronic, and whose consciences are indurated
through sedentary occupation and want of exercise.
It is known that blue pill will often cure blue devils: why not expel
other evil spirits? How do we know that oxide or chloride of mercury
would not have cast the demon out of NERO, or that BoMBA might
not be exorcised by a course of taraxacum?.. Black bile may be the
cause of more atrocities than you imagine. Of course, the P. of
psychological physic may be extended, and the progress of discovery
may enrich the Materia Medica with sedatives for envy, sialagogues
for hatred, expectorants for malice, and diaphoretics for all uncharita-
bleness, together with stimulants of all the cardinal virtues.
It is to be hoped, at any rate, that the Professor's Pills and Ointment
will rectify that derangement of common sense and disorder ºf mºral
perception, with which certain Judges appear to be so sadly afflicted.
MAMMON AND THE BISHOPS.
ERTAINLY the Ecclesiasti-
Commissioners have
treated the Bishops as if
they were no better than
common men, with souls
tinged with the jaundice
of filthy lucre. This we
hold to be a scandal. All
Bishops appointed after
the 1st of January, 1848,
are accountable to the
Commission; and, as we
think, in the most inde-
cent manner, are liable to
be pulled up on points of
vulgar arithmetic, like
money-takers on a turn-
ike trust. Fortunately,
owever, for the dignit
of the Church—by i.
we hope we understand
the money of the Esta-
blishment—there are not
many Bishops open to the
- insolence of the Commis-
sion. How few, in comparison, are Bishops of three years' growth !
Thus many years may elapse ere the whole bench can be submitted to
the indignity offered to the Bishops of 1848. Again, what chances
may in the interim occur P Beautiful and provident is the dogma
attributed to PALEy—“Never pay money †you can help it; some-
thing may happen:”—A bit of wisdom even worthy of a Bishop; espe-
cially of certain Bishops translated prior to 1848. -
Again, the Commissioners commit a gross affront, when, in the
matter of fines, they will not suffer the renewing lessee to pay the
amount into hands episcopal; but into the treasury of the Commission
itself. There is a doubt implied in this order cruel and scandalous to
the reverend body. For when did a Bishop refuse to pay, even to the
last farthing—and something in superflux—to the Ecclesiastical Com-
mission,--whose new orders in the matter of fines and recoveries smack
of the vulgar distrust of the coarse and the profane. It is with pain
we confess it; but the published determination of the Ecclesiastical
Commission, for the future conduct of the reverend bench, has a sort
of charge of constructive embezzlement.
The Spaniards have an uncharitable
of folks in º trust:—“It is with money as with oil; some of it
always sticks to the fingers of those who measure it.”, Now, this hard
i." *i: to the money-taker at a toll; but hardly to a
Bishop: to a am turnpike-man, but not a Fulham shepherd.
roverb, touching the weakness
“There's Poison in the (Tea) Cup!”—Hamlet's Mother.
THERE is a spurious tea sold, called “lie tea,” which is simply tea-dust
and sand made up with rice-water. Thus, when a lady enters a grocer's
shop, and asks for a pound of “genuine” tea, the worthy grocer smiles,
and thinks nothing of deliberately giving her the “lie.”
The Grocers may almost be called “THE PoisonERs of THE NINE-
TEENTH CENTURY.” . If they continue in their present deleterious
practices, they should be classed with Chemists, and, prevented from
selling green tea, as Chemists are prevented from selling arsenic. In
short, we now move—and we hope some influential Member will second
our motion next session—that “The Act for the Prevention of the Sale
of Poisons” be º: most stringently towards Grocers, or else, our
word for it, we shall not have a single washer-woman alive next year!

THE MONKEY TRIBE OF THE
METROPOLIS.
AMONG the manners and customs of the pre-
sent day, there is none more startling than a
practice that has lately grown up among the
children in our streets—if anything can be said
to be grown up which is met with nowhere but
in the juvenile º: of the community. The
ractice to which we allude is that of intro-
ucing the feats of the Bedouins into the public
thoroughfares; for it is impossible to enter town
by an omnibus from any suburb, without having
the vehicle accompanied by a parcel of children º
whirling round on their hands and feet by the
side of the wheels, after the pattern set by, the
Arabs at BATTy’s Hippodrome. It is really a
| lamentable thing to see so many children thrown
upon their own hands at such a very tender age,
and venturing so near to the wheels, that the
omnibus seems threatening every instant to
do the work of the car of JUGGERNAUT. We
cannot think what has got into the juvenile
population’s heads, that they should select that
very unusual portion of the body to stand upon.
The stranger walking along the Westminster
Road would fancy that the world had been
turned upside down, so many would he meet
with their heels where their heads ought to be.
Progress is an excellent thing, no doubt, but we
do not sympathise with the advance that is j
daily made, in such arts as running up incli
Fº on balls, jumping about on the ground
ike a frog or toad, and going round on the
hands and feet, after the manner of the sails of
a windmill. If “the child is the father of the
man,” our modern street boys will become the
rogenitors of a race of India-rubber Incredibles,
R. Cut Arabs, or Lambeth Acrobats. We
suspect that what are absurdly called the
“Drawing-Room Entertainments,” introducing
the contortion of infancy into all sorts of
most painful positions, have given rise to that
mania for acrobatising in the streets, which
renders it difficult for us to ascertain whether
an urchin is standing on his head or his heels
when we see him in a public thoroughfare.
Tayſ ERICA AT FAULT IN IRELAND.
THE American Ambassador, in his zeal to be
civil to Ireland, has overshot the mark, and has,
therefore, been piously rebuked by the nominal
ARchbishop of TUAM. M.R. LAWRENCE, in
answer to a Galway address, begged to be per-
mitted to hope great blessings for Ireland; and
one of these blessings—the Bible. , Yes: in a
hasty moment the American hoped that “all
Irishmen would be instructed in the book which
all Christians revere.” Upon this John M'HALE
informs the imprudent diplomatist that this once
he is forgiven for the iº he was doubt-
less taken by surprise. Henceforth, however,
no more impromptu replies; but well-considered,
cut-and-dried answers, in which, there shall be
no word about the Bible: a book not to be vul-
rised amongst the ignorant laity. ... Bishops,
if you please; but no Bible. When TELLIER—
who, as Louis THE FourtEENTH's Confessor,
had charge of the royal soul, which, to royal satis-
faction, he fitted for its future flight—when
TELLIER was opposed by a citation of the doc-
trines of SAINT PAUL and SAINT AUGUSTIN, he
was—like M“HALE-vehement in his wrath.
“SAINT PAUL and SAINT AUGUSTIN,” exclaimed
the Jesuit, “were hot-headed fellows, who, in
these days would have been thrust into the
Bastille.” Just as-in these days—the TELLIERs
of Ireland would thrust the Bible into a
dust-hole.
Household Worlds. – “Mamma! I want
some more bread and butter.”
PUNCH AND HIS CORRESPONDENTS.
Eare not surprised that
there should be a ge-
neral desire pervadin
the whole world o
those who can wield a
pen, to get a joke into
Punch; for, to be the
author of one short
line in that periodical
is higher honour than
to boast of a connection
with the longest line of
illustrious ancestors.
Feeling the power
we possess, of conferring immortality on the
smallest emanations from the humblest ink-
stand, we are obliged to use it very cautiously;
and though we should be delighted to contri-
bute to the happiness of all our correspondents
at once, by admitting something from each of
them into our imperishable columns—the portico to the true temple of Fame—we regret that
there is scarcely ever—certainly not more than once in five million times—an opportunity of
gratifying our benevolent desire.
We have at this moment before us a perfect Mont Blanc--we might truly say a Mount
Blank, as far as their value is concerned—of correspondents’ letters; and we put it to the
world—we put it to the writers themselves, in their lucid intervals, (if they ever have any,)
whether we should not be compromising our high position by mixing with the brilliants
of Punch the pieces of paste-and-scissors—of which we will give one or two specimens:–
Number One is from an individual signing himself “Young England,” who may, perhaps,
t in a plea of infancy, to save himself from liability on account of the following enormity.
!he unhappy stripling has ventured to ask us—
“Why is a beefsteak like a locomotive engine P” And he has positively dared to add the
reply—“Because it’s of little use without it’s tender.”
Number. Two is from a verbose caitiff, who has not the courage to attach a signature to
his dastardly attack on our patience. He writes us two long pages about an alleged joke,
perpetrated by an apocryphal hairdresser, on a fabulous old gentleman who has married a
mythical young lady, the whole party having been, no doubt, trumped up, to form the data
for our assailant's trumpery. The “joke” consists in the pretended remark of the apocryphal
hairdresser on his fabulous customer, that the latter has “the patience of a block;” and the
caitiff who sends it to us finishes with these atrocious words:–
“I am fully confident the witticism, and any illustration you may give to it, will cause
merriment to your readers.”
Merriment! Reader, have you laughed? Do you think you can ever, smile again after
this melancholy exhibition of human imbecility? Give it an illustration! Were we to insult
our artist by the base suggestion, might he not break his pencil, chop up his wood, or lay
; º hopelessly on the block, and withdraw from the world, refusing henceforth to draw
Or lt
Though bad begins, we are sorry to say that worse remains behind; for Number Three
outrages all our best feelings, and excites all our worst to a degree of irritation almost
uncontrollable. It runs as follows:–
“A CHAILENGE, to ALL NATIONs.-Shame a Railway Director—Mr. Punch, If you can
make anything of the above, it is at your service. “Yours, “SUGAR.”
We turn from SUGAR, with the bitterness of excessive disgust.
Number Four proceeds from one who, with remarkable rashness, has actually given his real
name and address, and who “begs to hand” us what he terms “a few. Enigmas, with the
answers, for insertion in our journal.”
The novelty of those Enigmas consists in the fact that the answer is the most enigmatical
part of them. The following is an example:—
“Why is the Crystal Palace like the Moon?—Because it’s borrowed.”
We were not aware that the moon was merely out on hire; but probably our correspondent,
who lives more immediately under the moon’s influence than ourselves, may know more of
its arrangements. But will any one believe that the following has actually been committed to
paper, as one of the “few enigmas”?
“Why is Punch so highly esteemed P”—“Because it’s a (Well-ink'd-un) WELLINGTON.”
The man who would assail another with such a dastardly blow as this, deserves—but we
cannot say what he deserves, for our Criminal Code is happily too merciful to enable us to
extract from it any adequate punishment.
Our readers will admit that we have gone far enough for one day; and as lunatics can
see the insanity of others, though they are not aware of their own calamity, we believe that
our correspondents, having seen the specimens here put forth, will acquiesce in the justice of
a general exclusion of all such effusions from our columns.
THE DISGRAcE To Down!NG STREET.-Our South African and other Colonial Dependencies
give us a great deal of trouble. John BUIL should remember that when a family of children
turns out ill, it is too generally the fault of the Governor.

“Since this assurance, the rich

portant fact in Jewish history.”
A very important, fact, , and
very illustrative of the Hebrew

º, “From this they can learn that the
acquisition of civil and religious liberty
is in their own power, if they will but have moral courage enough to exert the power
they possess—holding, as they do, the purse-strings of Europe."
There is a fine philanthropy in this; an enlarged sense of the
blessings of religious liberty. If the synagogue may stand, money
will be supplied for the destruction of Christian cities:, if the halter
be kept from the neck of the Hebrew, the Hebrew will undraw the
urse-strings of Europe to buy any number of halters for the patriots of

SCOLLARDS.
UNCH thought he should
never hear again of the edu-
cational establishment at
which instruction in “man-
ners” formed an extra of
“tuppuns moor.” It has
turned up once more, how-
eyer. The subjoined adver-
tisement, at least, can hardly
relate to any other Aca-
demy:—
B SCHOOL, con.
ducted by , M.A.,
Member of St. John's, Cambridge,
and Eight able and experienced
Masters. Members limited and
select. Term divides on the 29th
inst. The best parts of public
education are retained, and the
objectionable discarded. Three
young Gentlemen finish their edu-
cation this Michaelmas: one the
Nephew of a Solicitor holding a
high appointment under the Corporation of London, and Cousin to an eminent Queen's
Counsel; the other, son of an eminent Stock-broker; the third, a Merchant. He has
two of the vacancies filled by the Son of a Physician, who places his Son because he
is acquainted with a late Pupil of 's, who is about to take honours at the London
University; and the other by a Clergyman's Son, who is a Rector. References to a
French Gentleman in Paris, whose Son will also leave B for France shortly.
These Parties the Principal will cheerfully refer any parent or Guardian to as to
their Education, Domestic Comforts, Sound Health, Principles, and the formation of
Character and Disposition, which cannot be done with large and indiscriminate numbers.
Terms moderate.
The inquiring mind may be exercised by this wonderful piece of com:
ition. “Members limited and select”. Members, of what? Qf
t. John's, Cambridge, or Blank School?, What are the objectionable
parts of public education that are discarded? The parts of speech, in
matical arrangement, seem rather likely to be discarded by the
ard who conducts the school at Bank of the three young gentlemen
who finish their education this Michaelmas, is the first mentionednephew
of a solicitor, and also cousin to a Queen's Counsel; or is it the solicitor
who is the Queen's Counsel's cousin: Is the third really a merchantº
—this must be a commercial school indeed, if so. Has the merchant
—that is to say, the young gentleman, if the young gentleman is a
merchant—two of the vacancies filled by º son? How can
the physician's son fill two, vacancies? How can the merchant have
even one of the vacancies filled by the physician's son, if it is the physi-
cian who places his son? Does theº lace his son because his
son is acquainted with a late pupil of DR. BLANK’s, or because he
himself has that advantage? two of the vacancies are filled—no
matter, how—by the physician’s son, is the other, apparently described
as filled by a .. son, the third; and are there only three ?, Is
it true that the clergyman's son is a rector?. Of how many parties does
the French gentleman, to whom we are referred, consist?...And is it
for information touching their own education, &c., simply, that we are
referred to the parties ...; the French gentleman? Lastly,
what is it that cannot be done with large and indiscriminate numbers?
—the whole business of education as conducted at Blank School, or the
formation of character and disposition?
The terms of the Blank Schoolmaster are stated to be moderate-
considered in the relation which forms language, they may rather, be
described as low. They certainly make very imperfect English, if they
do not, indeed, make perfect nonsense. Yet DR. BLANK's st le is not
exactly foreign; on the whole, it would seem to be Irish;, that is to
#: º as might be expected from a successor to the original
h Tutor.
NO MORE LOW SPIRITS.
SoMEBODY has invented an article called “a Hydro-Electric Chain,”
to be worn by nervous individuals. It is to be worn round the neck,
and is to have the instantaneous effect of raising the spirits, dissipating
depression, and neutralising every feeling of nervousness.
e have no doubt we shall soon be inundated with Testimonials after
the following fashion:-
Testimonial, No. 1.
“Sir, Having a motion of course to make in the Court of Queen's
Bench, I suffered so severely from nervousness, that I could not utter a
word. Happily the Usher observing my distress, lent me one of your
Hydro-Electric Chains, which was no sooner round my neck than my
utterance, which had been previously choked, began to flow so º that
I spoke with the utmost boldness for upwards of an hour. I think your
Chain ought to be round the neck of every Barrister.
“Your obedient Servant,
“J. BRIEFLEss.”
Testimonial, No. 2.
“MR.DU.NUP presents his compliments to the Inventor of the Hydro;
Electric Chain, and begs to thank him for—what he never enjoy
before—a pleasant interview with a creditor. MR, DUNUP, having
observed his tailor coming up the court, felt one of his usual attacks of
nervous depression coming on, and was about to shut his outer door,
when he was induced to try the effect of the Hydro-Electric Chain,
which he'found so [marvellous, that he was not only able to face, but
even to threaten to kick down stairs his unfortunate creditor. As
MR. DUNUP has several bills, coming due very shortly, he will feel
obliged by a dozen of the Hydro-Electric Chains, to enable him to
:*: ills—or rather the presenters of the bills—with becoming

SONG FOR HARWEST-HOME.
Adapted to the Improved System of Agriculture.
Now harvest is carried and hous-ed at last,
And we’re met to partake our accustomed repast;
There’s all hands of us here that’s employed on the farm,
And a cup of good liquor wun't do us no harm.
Tol de rol, &c.
Here’s a health to our master, the founder of our feast,
Two pound of fat bacon a head at the least;
Likewise for each man half a gal’n of strong beer;
Yet our harvest-home wun't ruin master this year.
Tol de rol, &c.
Though many’s the labourers that he entertains,
There’s very few on 'em as ever complains;
More work and less grumbling I never did know;
So let’s drink to our master, and mistress also.
Tol de rol, &c.
The like of our ploughmen you never see before,
Doing ten times in one day what took three, or more;
Just to keep their pot bilin' is all they requires–
Works from morning till º not one ever tires.
Tol de rol, &c.
There’s our sowers, and thrashers, and winnowers likewise;
I warrant our mowers would also surprise:
But what, most of all, would a stranger confound,
is to see how our reapers gets over the ground.
Tol de rol, &c.
One reaper of ourn, mun, will rip e'er a field,
And the largest of crops it can possible yield:
He cuts, and he binds, and he pitches the sheaves:
And here is confusion to them that deceives.
Tol de rol, &c.
But scarce would folks credit the tale Irelates,
If I told 'em how little we drinks and weates;
Six pound of fat bacon, six quarts of strong beer,
Though we’ve all had º is the whole of our cheer.
Tol de rol, &c.
We mates, that our master maintains in employ,
Amounts to no more than two men and a boy;
The rest is Machines, strange although it may seem,
And the chief of his servants is osses and steam.
Tol de rol, &c.
When the gentlefolks dined at the fat cattle show,
They once used to drink to the Labourer, you know;
But, since such a vast alteration there’s been,"
I suppose that henceforward they’ll drink the Machine.
Tol de rol, &c.
Success unto farming !—come º me, you two;
For I can’t say, all round; and I likes to spake true.
And to think I should ever a harvest-home see
Where the whole of the party is Engines but we

PUNCH'S ANNIVERSARIES.—No. 7. SEDAN CHAIRS FIRST INTRODUCED INTO ENGLAND,
BY SIR SANDERS DUNCOMB, SEPTEMBER 27th, 1634.
AN INTERVIEW WITH THE SYRIO-LEBANON
FAMILY.
We called at the Egyptian Hall about two o'clock, and found the
family at home. We sent up our card (which is our passport all over
the world), and were introduced to them at once.
We found them in a first-floor back. The room at times is very
dark, but, º the view from the window is all the more delightful
for that. From this window you º the most charming Panorama
of the Holy Land... We must say the Syrio-Lebanon Family have been
been purposely constructed for them. Let them look out of their large
green-baize window, at what hour they will—at twelve, or three, or
of their lovely country unrolling themselves peacefully, like a picture
rom a cylinder, before their enraptured eyes.
As we entered the room, a piano was playing. It was strange to
We little
expected to fall over a ºf: on the top of Mount Lebanon, or to be
ough the gorgeous aisles of the Great
Mosque of Omar !
We were received most politely by the Syrio-Lebanon Family. They
are fourteen in, family; and a very fine family, too, as far as we can
judge. Their dress is very much in the Bloomer style, with the
addition of the Turkish fez. The ladies wear Bloomer trousers, with
ankle-jacks, and look very comfortable in them. -
To oblige us they got up a wedding. A Syrian wedding is gone
great deal of drinking. The noise resembles in shrillness the sound
which we have heard little field-boys make to º away the crows.
The smoking is the finest Turkish tobacco; and the ladies smoke as
well as the gentlemen. Fancy, marrying a young lady who has just
been smoking a long clay pipe, though the clay pipes which the Syrians
smoke are beautiful Narghiles; but, comparatively, it is all the same.
The drinking is, coffee and arrack, and they drink so many cups that
we wonder the happy couple are not sometimes carried to church on
Both the bride and bridegroom behaved remarkably well. The bride-
groom showed immense courage, which we could not help admiring,
and the bride did not cry, nor go into hysterics, nor faint, nor commit
any of the fashionable affectations peculiar only to English brides. We
thought this a great improvement on an English wedding, though the
"...º. was a sad falling-off. It consisted of more noise,
more pipes, and more coffee, without a single bottle of champagne; but
then, to make amends, there was no proposing of healths, and no
toasts, and no crying, when the bride was carried home. She'left her
papa and mamma in the happiest manner, and did not seem in the least
miserable because her husband was going to take her away. English
brides might learn a great deal from a Syrian wedding.
The coolness of the bridegroom, we must say, vastly surprised us.
He did not look in the least sheepish, nor ashamed of himself. If he
had been going through the Insolvent Debtors' Court, he could not
have taken it more coolly. This courage was all the more surprising,
as a Syrian bridegroom is not allowed to see his wife's face till after
the ceremony is completed, when it is too late, of course, to change it.
Fancy marrying a young lady, whom, in your mind's eye, you have
actually imagined to be all perfection and finding, when the veil was
lifted, that she squinted hat a dreadful blow to your mind's eye."
We are afraid that, if the Syrian ceremony was prevalent in England,
we never should get married at all. The mystery, would be so awful,
that we never should have the heart to face it., The ceremony is quite
terrible enough, as it is, without an additional terror being thrown, in
the shape of a veil, over it. By-the-by, this custom says but little for
the beauty of the Syrian women. Are the young ladies that play at
bo-peep round the cedars of Lebanon, so very plain that it is thought
prudent not to let their husbands see their faces till after they are
married? It is very lucky the custom does not exist with English
ladies, for very few, we are sure, would give their pretty countenances
to it. The veil would be torn to pieces in less than a week, or would
be made so transparent that any one, “with half an eye,”—as the ºf
is, though we never, recollect meeting any one who only, had “h
an eye”—would be able to see through it; and if any one did take the
veil, it would be because she could not get any one to marry her, or
because some designing Roman Catholic priest had persuaded her, poor
stretchers.

customs of far distant countries singularly differ. In Syria, the veil is
thrown aside when a young girl takes a husband. In England, is the
veil taken when a young girl renounces all future hopes of one. Of the
two, we decidedly prefer the Syrian veil.

he told most delightfully, his feet and hands making as much noise
as his tongue. If his story had a fault, it was a trifle too long, for it
lasted upwards of half-an-hour; beyond this, it was very amusing,
though we are sorry, from our ignorance of Arabic, that we could not

We do not know whether anybody is still in London (we write this
article from Windmill Hill, at Gravesend), but if there is any one, we
advise him, as a distant friend, to pay a visit to the Syrio-Lebanon
Family. He is sure, to be entertained, and can have no cause to
complain, more, especially as, at this time of the year, there cannot
be lºsiºn Family left in London worth paying a similar compli-

We had forgotten to say that there is a Syrian lecturer, who talks
the most perfect English;-so perfect, that many of our English
lecturers might take lessons from him, and yet not talk half so well,
or so amusingly, as he.

I have trod the Road of Nations every morning since the day
When the Exhibition opened, on that glorious first of May.
Let me throw my heartstrings open l—artist’s touch I don't require;
Let the hand of Recollectionſº stray across the lyre.
On the day the Palace opened, 'tis not now the time to dwell;
Qther bards have told the story, others yet will live to tell.
Guinea days I can remember, when the coronetted throng,
In the flunkey-furnished coaches, like a torrent poured along.
§ the sight; but soon it sated: admiration quickly starves
When 'tis fed on nothing better than a footman'sJ. calves.

They are like myself, I thought me—they who go and pay their crown.
Then there came the one-horse carriage, and the smart suburban fly,
With a family from Clapham, or a group from Peckham Rye.
Peckham Rye | that-thought is madness—for’twas there, in early youth,
I believed MATILDA JoHNsoN to have been the soul of truth.
Yes, I see her now in fancy, as her form I used to see,
At her father's homely table, pouring out the evening tea,
With an elder sister's kindness—(ah, how closely love observes!)–
Watering her brother's tea-cup, to protect his little nerves.
Often at the square pianº, .. her sweet contralto voice,
She would warble, “Still so gently,” 't was the aria of my choice.
But ’tis past !-Matiºn, joissos gave my heart a sudden stab,
Marrying * horrid Quaker, in a suit. of dismal drab.
-
Recollection! thou hast wander'd-straying idly thou hast been;
Take me to the Exhibition—lead me back to Knightsbridge Green.
Ah, where was I?, But no matter–Mem'ry, pursue thy ways;
Set me down about the middle of those wondrous shilling days,
When the 'busses, overloaded, brought the Million daily down
From the country's far recesses, from all corners of the town;
Every class and every station, young and old, and rich and poor,
Privileged alike to enter Industry's inviting door.
Great, indeed, the Exhibition;, great in more respects than one!
Not to Art can be conceded all the good that it has done:
Much that’s good in human nature it has also served to show;
Witness vans of pauper children in a long continuous row;
Witness wagons º with workmen, in a liberal employ, |
Going the Exhibition wonders gaily gratis to enjoy;
School-boys, school-girls, homely tenants, labourers upon the farm,
By the bounty of the richer, to the Crystal Palace swarm;
Some in carts, and some in wagons; some in dress of every style:
He is only out of fashion who neglects to wear a smile. .
Though 'twill all be shortly over, the impression will remain
Of how one has help'd the other—and can do the same again.
BALLOONING AT HOME AND ABROAD.
ANOTHER balloon has lately burst—of course, with “our own
correspondent” in the car, who notes the circumstances with perfect
coolness; describing the “crack like a musket shot.”—the dizzy
descent—the throwing overboard of ballast—the cutting the cords—the
conversion of the balloon into a parachute—and the final landing in a
market-garden—as accurately as if he had been sent up for the express
purpose of coming down in this way, and so indulging the public with
a full, true, and particular account of all that takes place when a
balloon explodes at a mile from the earth. -
It has ſong been admitted that the balloon is a perfectly useless
invention; but the veteran GREEN’s long experience had led the public
to believe that a balloon-ascent was not only a useless, but a safe
erformance; and its attraction, as a show, had naturally died away.
ut now that the excitement of danger is introduced into the feat, the
aéronaut is a sure card; and not a suburban Hippodrome, Garden,
Saloon, or Stingo, but announces its balloon-ascent.
But our ballooming is a wretchedly tame business compared with that
on the other side ă. Channel. Here it is always the same “veteran
GREEN,” with his shabby coat and his fur cap—the same three gents
who have clubbed their respective £5 notes, and who try so hard to
look “plucky” as they clamber into the car—with “our own
correspondent,” of course, to report any blow up, or break down, that
may occur.
When the balloon is once filled, and its swag-bellied oscillation over,
has shot up into the air, and GREEN has saluted with his flag, and the
gents, holding very hard º rim of the car, have waved their hats,
and when the sand of the first ballast-bag emptied, has come down into
the upturned eyes of the crowd, there really is nothing left to stare at.
But in France they manage these things much better. In the first place
the aeronauts of France are not veterans, but green jº 3. In
have none of those scruples about risking their necks, which “Veteran
GREENs,” with wives and families, may be excused for indulging.
The notion of going up in a common-place car is quite exploded.
I have just come back from Paris, where, in a fortnight I have had
the pleasure of seeing borne into the air, at the tail of a balloon-
1. An eight-oar boat, with its crew and steersman.
2. A four-roomed house, with its furniture and occupants.
3. A phaeton and a pair of horses, with the aëronaut and lady inside,
and their mounted groom underneath.
4. A car, with “the intrepid THEVELIN" on a slack-rope suspended
from it, throwing innumerable somersets and “roasting the pig” in mid
air, till we could see him no longer.
5. Ditto, with an allegorical group of young ladies, in aerial suspen-
sion, bearing wreaths of flowers and other graceful devices.
Do not let our readers imagine that this is a joke. The bills of these
various performances may be inspected at the office of this periodical.
I don’t speak of the bulls, asses, horses, and ostriches, on which
M. and MADAME Poitevin are in the habit of disporting, as animal
ascents are now used up, and it is supposed that not even an aeronautic
elephant would draw an audience in Y.
Here is a fine field opened for English imitation. Let MEssRs.
BATTY, SIMPson, ELLIS, and SoxER, go to work and show us what a
balloon may be made to raise. The objects to be chosen must, of
course, be the last one would expect to see going up-such as .
bonds, Mr. HUDsoN's reputation, Protectionist principles, or Caledonian
Railway shares.
Prince Metternich on Dry Land.
“AFTER me, the deluge,” said PRINCE METTERNICH in his hour of
lory: an inundation came, and the Prince was floated to England.
The waters have somewhat subsided, and, on his way to Vienna,
“PRINCE METTERNICH has arrived in Stuttgard.” We have little doubt,
however, so astute is the Prince, that he does not trust in the con-
tinuance of dry land, but, ready for another deluge, has duly prepared
himself with a cork-jacket.

THE KNIGHT OF GARRON TOWER.
WHo says the age of chivalry is extinct” As long as Garron Tower
stands in the County Antrim, and there sits in that tower a party who
wields the pen of a statesman, and the sword-point of a knight—so
long Chivalry cannot be said to be actually defunct. She may be on her
last legs, and those the limbs of CHARLEs WILLIAM, MARQUIs OF
LoNDoNDERRY. But there he is yet; there he is on Garron Tower;
CHARLEs WILLIAM, the good knight; sword and axe—plume and sur-
coat, lance and pennon—hurray, hurray—on a great thundering wooden
.." ... a la rescousse-pounding down upon
you, driving his iron through you, slashing your head off; one, two,
three, whack, carte, tierce, St. GeoRGE, into your midriff, off goes your
head; and the prodigious combat with the giant Nobody over, the
brave old victor canters round to the bower where the Queen of Love
and Beauty sits, and gracefully receives the guerdon. Since the days
when a certain hero of La Mancha used to go a-riding, there has been
nobody like CHARLEs WILLIAM for a happy gravity, a courteous
splendour, and a high-bred manner of dealing with giants, which only
belongs to your true knight.
It is true that some men say there is also SIBTHORP.--SIBTHORP
pooh! A brave warrior is he of Lincoln and a good knight, but he
demeans himself by pleasantries—he is a mad wag—go tol Now the
Knight of Garron Tower never jokes, any more than did the lover of
the peerless lady of Toboso; he salutes you with a grave grace before
he is at you; and drives his lath weapon through you with all the
courtesies of war. It is because he is so grave, he is so irresistible.
Given, that yonder post is a giant; yonder empty tub in the yard a
roaring dragon; the pole which the warrior bestrides a galloping destrier;
and the weapon he brandishes, a deadly mace or curtal axe, not a stick
with a bladder tied at its end; and you have before you courage,
generosity, courtesy—a hero. The combat with the post over, he takes
off the saucepan which has served him for a shining morion, wipes his
fevered brow, and gallops round gracefully for another career at the tub.
. Lately, in his wanderings in quest of dragons, giants, and virgins in
distress, the Knight of Garron Tower came to a certain castle, called
Amboise Castle, in which he found, confined and guarded, a Mahometan
Knight once famous in battle, and who had met and conquered the
best French warriors in a hundred fields. But being overcome by
numbers, the gallant Turk had given in, and had yielded, himself
up with his family, to the French King: on a promise from the latter
that he should quit the King's pretended dominions in Africa, and
be set free. But the treacherous monarch of France, having in his
possession the doughty Chieftain of Mauritania, refused to set him free,
according to his kingly word, and locked him in the castle of Amboise,
where he pined, to the disgrace of chivalry, so that the very minstrels
of England sang his valour, his capture, and his traitorous captivity.
This knight, this captive, this bravest of the followers of MAHOUND
in his captivity the noble Knight of Garron found. A crying sin and
shame it was, said he, and swore to set the noble Arab free. He
galloped straightway to KING PHILIP's court, and begged him to
release the Turk from Amboise Fort. PHILIP, a courteous and astute
old Prince, when charged with his crime by the MARQUIs of LoNDON-
DERRY, no doubt felt his conscience wince. “Most Noble Knight,”
he said, “and doughty English Thane, famed at Vienna's Congress, and
likewise in Spain! That I have locked up this here valiant Turk it is
most true: a dirty piece of work. That I have promised his release is
true, yet (though perhaps no business 'tis to you). I give my royal word
from dungeon vile I quickly will set free this Arab child.” He did not
keep his word, and what ensued?—a bloody revolution plunged his land
in blood The fierce Republic raised her sanguine head, and perjured
PHILIP called a cab, and fled, until us Britons bold he took refuge
with, under the vulgar name of MR. SMITH,
In the meanwhile poor ABD-EL-KADER lay locked in Amboise Castle,
as close as ever: and his untiring champion now came to “the nephew
of the Emperor NAPOLEoN, now,” as Lord L., finely remarks, “the
President of the French Republic,” and asked him to let out the Arab
captive. Entreaty, eloquence, passionate appeal, elegant compliment,
homo tu quoque, brilliant and astounding metaphor, cut—thrust-carte
tierce—upper cut—under cut—run you through the body, horse an
foot l—Never was there such an assault as that of the Knight of Garron
Tower, and he publishes the result of the transactions up to the present
moment. “My despatch,” says he to the President, “ was official, and
sent through the Minister of War.” You see this single Knight, alone
yonder in Garron Tower, county Antrim, engages, de pair en pair, with
actual Governments, with great Presidents of Republics, who have
five hundred thousand men at their back, besides National Guards.
“Come on,” cries hel “I’m not afraid,” says plucky little Garron
Tower. “ Witness, Europe—witness, all the .."! I challenge you to
answer why ABD-EL-KADER is not set free.”
And what is the consequence of this manly conduct? The admiration
even of Frenchmen is extorted.
“I ought to state, in the course of this affair I have been greatly assisted by a
noble and distinguished personage in Paris, to whom I have sent a copy of my letter of
August the 25th. He requested leave to publish it in the French journals, and it may
be known in France prior to your doing me the favour of noticing it in the Morning
Post. I subjoin what he says:—
“‘M. DE LA GUERRoNIERE, qui est motre plus grand écrivain politique, vient de lire
votre lettre; il désire la publier dans son journal, Le Pays, dont LAMARTINE estaussile

d'état et la pointe d'épée d'un chevalier. Cet appel d'un grand coeur retentira dans le
coeur de la France et de son Gouvernement.'
“You will not, Sir, accuse me, I am sure, of quoting the above from vanity: the
advantage, in my object, of such men and such authority as I feel I possess, enables
me to support any personal criticism or disapprobation.”
The great GUERRoNIERE has read the Marquis with emotion and
bonheur. He says his Lordship's work is a masterpiece, written with
the pen of a statesman, and the sword-point of a knight. He has
given the President (and Louis-PHILIPPE, but he is done for) some
home-thrusts truly. (Copy.)

“Mere phrases and words do not belong to Louis NApoleon, unless prosperity pro-
duces a different nature from adversity. Your Chambers are about to be prorogued;
your splendid fates to the Industry of all Nations are past; there is surely now time to
turn a thought on the poor prisoner of Amboise. In the intoxicating fairy-land of the
Hôtel de Ville, when hundreds and thousands of souls poured the wide stream of
flattery and incense around you, did the thought never occur, “Where was . ABD-EL-

Can you refuse, mon Prince, after this? No, the Emir must be free. He shall

And, noble knight, honest old Knight of Garron, when you ask why one man
who fought bravely for his country against immense odds, may not go out of
France : ask why another, who, too, was a chief in a noble and unavailing struggle,
may not pass through France? ABD-EL-KADER is at Amboise, because Kossuth

BLOOMERISM AND BUNIONISM.
IMPORTANT MEETING OF LADIES.
NUMERous and Fashionable
Assembly of Ladies was
held yesterday, at PHYLLIs's
Rooms, to consider what
course it would be expedi-
ent to adopt in regard to
Bloomerism.
LADY PARKE LANE was
voted into the chair, re-
marking, that though she
certainly had been in service
as a maid-of-honour, she
little thought ever to be a
chairwoman.
MRs. TYBURNE said, the
question before them was
one which affected the wives
and daughters of England.
Miss Rhoda EDGEwARE
thought it affected the
daughters more than the
wives. Married ladies had
accomplished the principal
object of all dress; what
they wore was compara-
tively, unimportant, except
to their husbands.
MRs. WILTON CRESCENT
thought the Bloomer cos-
º tume decidedly a wives’
- - - * question. The principal
§. in dispute was precisely that which had been the subjeet of contention
etween man and wife from the beginning of the world. . .
Miss KENSINGTON said, not quite from the very beginning. The controversy
commenced precisely when married life ceased to be a state of Paradise.
MRs. GALLY GAskyNs would assert the rights of woman. -- -
MRs. FAIRFIELD observed that property had its duties as well as its rights.
Would not those ladies who might appropriate the article of dress alluded to, be
liable to certain inconveniences affecting its pockets?. -
Miss Titterron wanted to know where they carried their watches. Did they
wear waistcoats as well? -
The CHAIRwoMAN thought these details were irrelevant. The question was,
would Bloomerism effect a reform in costume or not? -
MRs. MyDDELTON approved of moderate reform, but looked upon Bloomerism
as a revolution.
Miss IIGHTFoore was of opinion that the present dresses were much too long.
Everybody said it was a great pity. She had heard it remarked, that they gave
the idea of being slipshod and slovenly—anything but what was cleanly and meat.
She did not think them at all nice.
MRs. Hoore thought the present fashion a very sensible one. Comfort was the
great thing—at least, at her time of life; and a good long gown enabled her, to
wear a warm worsted stocking and a list shoe, which was a real blessing for her
poor corns and rheumatism.
MESDAMEs HobbLER, LIMPRINs, and SPLAYFoot, and MissEs HALTER and CLUBB,
expressed similar sentiments to those of the last speaker. -
Miss Punch agreed with what her papa said, that the real question was one
between Bloomerism and Bunionism. The Bunionists wanted long dresses, for an
obvious reason; the Bloomerists short ones, for a reason equally obvious., Good
taste lay between. Miss LIGHTFoote had said on a former occasion, she had no
notion, of being fancied to hide a “cornucopia” under her flounce....That was
natural. Still that was no reason why she should go about in a frock like that of
the celebrated “little old woman cut shorter.” Gowns of a fashionable length,
however, were certainly mere veils to conceal ugliness and untidiness; or, if not,
it was only because they served for brooms as well. Her opinion, therefore, as
well as her papa's, was that they should concede an inch to the demand for
the reform in dress, but oppose the Bloomerists' clamour for an ell. -
These sentiments having been generally approved of, were embodied in a
resolution, which passed without opposition, except from MRs. Hoofe and her
artisans, on the one hand; and on the other, from
W. GALLY GAsKYNs: and thanks having been voted
to the Chairwoman for her conduct in the Chair, the
fairy-like meeting vanished. .
ROMAN CATHOLIC MIRACLES.
WE. may be partly prepared to believe, in Roman
Catholic miracles, as soon as we see the following miracles
accomplished:—
As soon as DR. CAHILL is taught to keep in his head a
respectful tongue. - - - . . . . . .
s soon as the Roman Catholic Priests cease instigating
the poor Irish against England, and impressing them with
the wicked notion, that England is the source of all their
poverty and woes. - -
As soon as CARDINAL WIse MAN has succeeded in rearing
the “little Paradise” round Westminster Abbey which he
talked so boastingly about in his Address.
As soon as the Pope practises in all his actions the ex-
treme benevolence he professes in all his words; and, as
the first proof of it, releases the hundreds of poor prisoners
now confined for political offences, in the dungeons of
Naples and Rome. -
As soon as the Pope allows an English Cathedral to be
built in the centre of Rome, as we allow a Roman Cathe-
dral to be built in the middle of London.
As soon as the French soldiers are driven out of
Rome, and the Pope's body-guard consists of none but
Romans.
As soon as the above extraordinary events are accom-
plished, we shall be better prepared to believe any impos-
sibility in the way of pictures that wink, or statues that
bleed, or cabbages that sneeze, or anything else they please;
for nothing short of a miracle can bring to pass the accom-
plishment of events so utterly improbable, if not perfectly
impossible. When they are accomplished, we will promise
to be amongst the most stubborn believers in Roman
Catholic miracles; but till then, we must be allowed the
healthy privilege of a little rational incredulity.

Declension of Bloomerism.
THE names of MR. and MRs. DEXTER are associated
with the Bloomer costume. Thus we have DExTER and
DEXTRA, masculine and feminine; but as the dress in
question seems to belong indifferently to either gender
—that is, to neither in particular, or to the neuter—the
wearer ought surely to be DEXTRUM.

“Huzzah, my boys! don’t mind the noise.”
| “HOW THE GREAT PROTECTION BALL00N BURST,
AND THOSE IN THE CAR WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT.”
(Being a New Song to an Old Aylesbury Air, “Bucks, have at ye all!”)
WITH woe and wail, I tell the tale of the Great Balloon ascent, Sirs,
When, in a fright, to dizzy height, the British farmer went, Sirs;
Their aeronaut, so trim and taut, but lacking circumspection,
Was BENJAMINDIs RAELI, of the old Balloon “Protection,”
Bow, wow, wow; Foll de roddy, oddy, oddy; Bow, wow, wow.
“Get in like men,” says downy BEN; “the gas is on 3. see, Sirs,
And up sky-high you’re safe to fly, if you’ll be steered by me, Sirs.
We’ll first let go, the ballast, so—and then the valves we’ll fasten;
The one makeslight the car for flight, the other keeps the gas in.”
Bow, wow, wow, &c.
The farmers start; soon inside out had turned each bag and pocket,
And towards the moon the big Balloon shot upwards like a rocket;
The ballast gone, the valves tied down—when sudden BEN reflected,
That doubtless those who with him rose, to be brought down expected.
Bow, wow, wow, &c.
The farmers sat, each broad-brimmed º: down with desperation,
Their fists hard clench'd, their foreheads drench'd with anxious per-
spiration;
Whileimaspeech BEN proved to each success theascentimust crown, Sirs;
And softovoce asked himself, “How the deuce shallweget down, Sirs?”
Bow, wow, wow, &c.
(The Balloon here gave a
rumble.)
“None e'er did soar so high before.” (Aside.) “Loºp, when wetumble!
| Andwhenrestored to friends adored, you’llboast yourselves the first, Sirs,
Whoreached the moon in a Balloon. (Aside.) By Jove, it’s burst, Sirs.”
w, wow, wow, &c.
The simplemen, whose faith in Ben was something quite affecting,
Sat still at first, blow-up or burst, not in the least suspecting;
The silk it gaped, the gas escaped, while they, their eyes upt
Cried, “Loºp, how high into the sky Protection be a-going!”
ow, wow, wow, &c.
Qºth Bºs,who knew what was to do, (old GREEN, is not more cute, Sirs),
“The thing for me, I plainly see, is to make a Parachute, Sirs;

Talk as I will, they’ll argue still, it’s up, not down, we’re going.”

CANDIDATES FOR THE CHARITY OF THE EXHIBITION.
Wºhave received a number of suggestions for the disposal of the
Exhibition surplus; two of which follow:—
No. 1.
To the Editor ºf Punch.
“SIR,-Might Iventure to suggest that a part, at least, of the vast
amount of profit which will have accrued to the Royal Commissioners
from the Receipts of the Great Exhibition, shall be applied to the
foundation of an Asylum for decayed Cheesemongers? “ STILTON.”
No. 2.
“SIR,-When the question of the disposal of the proceeds of the
Exhibition comes to be considered, I hope the debt of England to her
sister kingdom will not be forgotten. I propose that the whole of the
sum be devoted to the liquidation of the claims now made by Govern-
ment on Irish Poor-Law Unions; and that the remainder shall be
applied to the more effectual relief of Irish encumberedestates. Ithrow
qut this suggestion as a demand of justice, and I hope that my natural
diffidence has not prevented me from explaining myopinions as
“An IRISH LANDLORD.”
Nautical Farce of all Nations.
Everybody is familiar with the phrase “performing quarantine,”
but few, fortunately, have endured the performance. A Congress has
met at Paris, with a view to pronounce judgment respecting this
serious infliction on the merchants and travellers who are condemned
to sit or sleep it out. The prejudices of a section of medical men have
been absurdly humoured in the piece of useless precaution alluded to;
and therefore much argument and many words may be wasted in the
attempt to preserve it on the stage of nations. But, in the simple fact
that no worse plague than itself is ever known in the Lazaretto
Theatre, where it is enacted, the Congress has sufficient reason to
determine that it is a worthless farce, which ought not to be performed
any more.
MEETING (VERY) EXTRAORDINARY OF THE
BISHOPS.
FTER the notice appeared in the Gazette
on the subject of the incomes of the
Bishops, a meeting was held by the
Right Reverend Prelates, who came
together spontaneously for the pur-
pose of doing as an act of grace, what
is declared to be honest and just,
though the law.cannot make their
honesty and justice imperative,
We do not mention individual
names, where the conduct of all is so
much alike, and where all deserve to
be viewed in the same light as pat:
terms of self-denial, humility, and all
the other virtues which it is their
sacred duty to practise and incul-
cate. It was urged by one of the
Bishops appointed previously to 1848,
that though the º would allow
them to go on pocketing a large
surplus beyond the income they were
intended to receive, still, after the
late Order in Council, it would be
impossible to go on doing so without
being guilty of a rapacity in the
pursuit of superfluous wealth, which
is highly unbecoming in a body of
tº men so remarkable for an utter
abnegation of * principle of
worldliness. The Right Reverend
Prelate admitted that he and his
brethren had been for some years appropriating thousands of pounds
more than had been appointed for their incomes; but they had done
so in a spirit of meek submission...to, circumstances; and if these
circumstances happened to be particularly flourishing in a pecuniary
sense, there was no help for it. -
It was the general feeling of the Bishops that the late Order in
Council seemed to contemplate the Right Reverend Bench as a class
of persons whom it is usualto describe as “better known than trusted;”
for it leaves nothing to their honour, or honesty, for the future, but
applies the screw to all who are henceforth to be appointed. Hitherto,
the experiment has been tried, whether the Bench would voluntarily do
what was right; but their opposition to the voluntary principle has
been as stubborn on this as on other º: and therefore the newly-
appointed Bishops are to be made to do what is right-at least, with
regard to their incomes.
At the very extraordinary meeting to which we have alluded, some
very extraordinary resolutions were carried. The following-we have
heard—was the principal point on which the Right Reverend Prelates
unanimously agreed; and we hope to see the following printed shortly
as an authorised advertisement in all the newspapers :-
“At a meeting of the whole Bench of Bishops, called by Common
Decency, and presided over—on this occasion—by Good Sense, it was
“Resolved UNANIMously,
“That though, by a late Order in Council, those, Bishops only, who
have been, and may hereafter be, appointed, since the 1st of January,
1848, are to be reduced to those paltry pittances, beginning, at £4200,
and ascending to £10,000 a year, which have been absurdly thought
adequate to supply the very simple necessities of the titled teachers of
humility—they, the Bishops appointed previously to 1848, doyoluntarily
put themselves on an equal footing with their poor bereaved brethren,
and will pay over, half-yearly, whatever they may receive beyond the
income they are injustice and honour entitled to.
“It was further resolved unanimously, That any other course than that
prescribed º the above resolution, would place the º appointed
previous to 1848, before the world as a Right Reverend body of men
taking advantage of an accident or oversight to retain excessive incomes
which they were not intended to enjoy, and which—particularly after
the late Order in Council—they could not retain without a violation of
the dictates of morality and honour.
“It was further and finally resolved unanimously, That all pecuniary
sacrifices are contemptible in the eyes of the Bishops, when compared
with the interests of the holyl religion over which they preside, and
which they cannot but feel would suffer most materially were they to
continue—particularly after the late Order in Council-in receipt of the
enormously excessive revenues, which, though perhaps secured to them
by the strict letter of the law, as it now stands, are considered
universally as a disgrace, rather than an honour, to the Right Reverend
recipients.”

EALLY the Quack Medicine Wendors
seem terribly put to it for some-
thing new in the shape of a cure.
In the dearth of other patients, the
Lunatics have kindly and appro-
priately come toº to patronise
the quack medicines, as will be
seen by the following extract from
a country journal:—
“MADNEss.-SAMUEL CRABB, of Pinhoe,
near Exeter, who had twice been the
inmate of a Lunatic Asylum, was tho-
roughly restored to reason, when he was
verging upon his seventieth year! MR.
Kirr, landlord of the Heart of Oak Inn,
Pinhoe, vouches for this case, as also for
another in the same neighbourhood,
, “where a young man was effectually
cured, in a single night, of insanity, by
swallowing the whole contents of a thir-
teen-penny-halfpenny box of No. 2 Pills, which had been inadvertently left in his
| bed-room.'
We suspect, however, that there is nothing very new in the con-
nexion between the pills alluded to and the Insane; for we should
imagine none but madmen could have been attracted by the puffing

About his landing on our shaw;

CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE.
THERE seems some difficulty in getting the
public to have an eye to Cleopatra's needle,
which is, nevertheless, valuable, on account of
its connexion with the thread of history. A
recent writer in the Times suggests that the
needle should be allowed to remain sticking in
the mud of Memphis, in order that we may bring
over from the same spot a statue of Rameses,
the Sesostris of the Greeks, who only wants a
new head-dress and a new pair of legs to place
him on a footing with the most respectable pieces
of sculpture.
We, by no means, coincide with the suggestion
to leave Cleopatra's needle behind; for considering
the tremendous piece of work she was always
getting up, the needle of Cleopatra must always
be an object of interest.
advertisements in which the universal effects of quack medicines are
stated. There is something melancholy, and yet mirthful, in the idea
of a young lunatic jumping out of bed, “swallowing the entire contents
of a thirteen-penny-halfpenny box of No. 2, which had been inad-
vertently left in his room,” and waking up in the morning with all his
mental faculties restored to him. e can, nevertheless, very well
believe, that if any insane person should enter upon a course of quack
pills, a single box will be quite enough to bring him to his senses.
BOMBA’S DEWOTIONS.
In the Morning Post it is recorded that—
“At the recent celebration of the annual solemnity of the Holy Virgin of Piedigrotta,
at Naples, the King reviewed 54 battalions of infantry, 42 squadrons of cavalry, and
9 field batteries, in honour of the “Queen of Heaven.'”
We know who is meant here by the absurd title “Queen of Heaven;”
but is that Heaven BoxBA's Heaven, and that personage BoMBA’s
Queen P. We should think not. In the first book of Paradise Lost is
contained an account of certain spirits, who, ascending out of another
place, established themselves on earth as heathen deities. Among
them, sings MILTON,
“Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians called
Astarte, queen of heaven.”
This we should rather take to be the goddess 'of BoMBA's idolatry;
the divinity in whose honour he let off his murderous cannon, and burnt
his sulphurous incense.

PUNCH*S NOTES AND QUERIES.
UR curious and enter-
taining contempo-
rary, ing the

have notes addressed
to him occasionally,
which ought to have
been forwarded to
the
therefore,
and them writing re-
plies to them. -
An individual in
a recent number,
who signs himself
“L. L. L.,”—(did
ever three ells go
to such an absurd
length before?)-in-
quires into the al-
leged insanity of
arch hares. We
beg to assure him
that there is no au-
thority for the say-
ing, that hares ac-
tually go mad in
March, though it is
about the time of
the year when each
very particular hare may be seen to stand on end—which is, perhaps,
the origin of the old saying. - -
Dalstonia, in the same number, inquires, “Who wrote Mºth ER
BºsTaiºsº." Need we tell him that Mother Busch's Tales all
came out of MoTHER BUNCH's head in the usual manner? -
One A.C. writes a short note to inquire what is the meaning of
“Boosing Grass.”. We neverheard of “boosing grass,” but we have no
hesitation in explaining it to be any kind of grass that a man, in a state
of intoxication, happens to lie down upon.
We shall, from time to time, furnish answers to the notes—as well
as the queries—sent to our contemporary; and those who do not find a
satisfactory reply, in the pages, of our ingenious, little friend, will,
perhaps, meet with enlightenment in our own periodical.
AN HISTORICAL TEA-PARTY.
THE English Court Circular is the most vital bit of English history;
and more than any other piece of literature exalts usin, our own eyes
and in the eyes of the nations as a most philosophic and withal
most methodical people. By means of the Circular—which is a note
written to the present world and the world's posterity—we and future
generations learn that on such a morning, on such an hour, Majesty or
minor Royalty took a ride or walk; a knowledge, that doubtless
enhances the value of royalty in the breasts of the loyal and the con-
templative. With this abounding faith in the exalting uses of Court
news as shouted from the minarets of a palace, we are happy to find
that the visits of two of HER MAJESTY's little boys are already deemed
of sufficient national importance to be gravely chronicled for the present
and the future:
*The Pance or Watts and Pance. Altººn honoured Sir JAMEs and LADY
Claak with their company AT TEA, at Birkhall, on Saturday afternoon!"
This announcement is affecting by its very simplicity. “AT TEA '''
Two monosyllables set forth the whole ceremony. As two cherry-stones
may be made to contain a double service of tea-spoons; so do two
words shut up all the pomp and circumstance of a princely tea-party!
Yet, we fear that the very brevity of theº however sufficient
for the severely wise, may fail to satisfy the more curious and news-
mongering of our generation. Busy thousands may ask—and vainly
ask—“was it green tea?” Another multitude may anxiously inquire
—“was the tea black?” A third impulsive host may emphatically
desire to learn—“was it mixed?” History having chronicled the fact
of the “Tea,” ought not to have omitted the particular canister. This
is a fault; nevertheless, let us be thankful that we are assured, past
all doubt, present and future, that tea was stirred, sipped, and
swallowed by the PRINCE or WALEs and PRINCE ALFRED, at the table
ºf SIR JAMEs and LADY CLARK, at Birkhall, on a Saturday afternoon!
To our stock of historical knowledge this is something.
Great is the effect of the doings of baby and boy princes upon the
folks they are in due season to control and govern. How much of our
veneration towards PRINCE GARGANTUA may we owe to our knowledge
of his doings with his nurses; who, every morning, to cheer him up,
“would º with a knife upon the glasses, on the bottles with their
stopples, and on the pottle-pots with their lids and covers!” And
when we learn that, in his infancy, PRINCE PANTAGRUEL “at every
meal supped up, the milk of four thousand six hundred cows,” we are
wisely prepared by such knowledge to await and expect the full-blown
lory of his after-time. Thus, we shall consider the tea-table of LADY
LARK as the starting historical point of the little PRINCE OF WALES
and the lesser PRINCE ALFRED.
LINES TO BE RECITED ON THE CLOSING OF
THE EXHIBITION.
At last the Exhibition closes—but
Most things that open are obliged to shut;
Its knell is tolled º its electric clock,
Which strikes—and everybody feels the shock,
“Happy,” cries Colonel, SIBTHORP, “the release!”
Well, well!—the Exhibition’s end is peace.
That end was gained, and SIBTHome must confess
The whole affair has been a great success.
Among ourselves—with folks of foreign lands,
We’ve had one general scene of shaking hands;
The whole World's arms have great John Buli embraced,
But failed to compass his enormous waist.
Grim Disaffection ne'er has reared his head,
With beard, and blouse, and P ian fool's cap red;
Norformed the pike, nor forged the bolt of fear
Byloading bottles meant for ginger-beer.
Still London stands, her thousand sewers amid,
And Liverpool—exactly where she did.
'Twas order everywhere, and quiet all;
There ne'er were better manners at a ball."
Oh cabment mourn the Exhibition's end!
You'busmen, also, should lament your friend;
The arts it fostered—they were not a few—
Qwa prººf omnibus—were good for you.
Alas! ye worthies of the whip and rein,
When can you hope for such a chance again?
With such a multitude of fares to meet,
And such a lot of foreigners to cheat
Time, the great Showman, soon will let us know
The grand results of this gigantic Show.
A finer taste—there’s reason to suppose-
Will carve our furniture, and cut our clothes;
Will o'er our glass, our plate, and crockery reign,
And dye our fabrics with a nicer stain;
Enhance each ornament which Beauty decks,
And add attraction to the female sex.
Meanwhile, a new machine our harvest mows;
A novel fire-arm threatens England's foes.
But all that’s fine must have its day, or hour-
The World’s great Fair, or garden's little flower;
And stiless time can iaiſord to spend-
So thus I bring my verses to an end.
THE EXPECTED REFORM.

What are you doing? I have not heard a word from i. for
It is said that you are at work on a plan for extending the

representation—how do you get on with it? ...Mind what you are
about: as it is, you will have trouble enough with the Irish Brigade
next session; but that will be nothing to the difficulty you will encounter
from the manoeuvres of the papal enemy, if you, allow Parliament to
dissolve without having considerably increased the representatives of
true Britons. I am, my dear Lord, everybody's adviser, but more
particularly, at the present moment, yours,
33NH2CH4.
P.S. The Conservatives and Protectionists may, perhaps, think it
desirable that the Irish element should possess more influence in the

their utmost to defeat any such plan of Reform as that which I
recommend you to bring forward. P

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
AGE BEFORE HONESTY IN THE CHURCH.
N Advertisement, of which
the following is a literal
copy, appeared in the
Cambridge Chronicle of
the 13th of September,
1851:—
TO AGED CLERGY-
MEN.—A Clergyman, not
less than Seventy-seven, is
sought, for presentation to a
vacant Benefice. His views
must not differ materially from
those of the Primate.
“It is desirable that he
should possess some small Pri-
vate Means.—References will
be required.
“Address , care of Mr.
—, Cambridge.
“N.B.-No applications can
be replied to except from
parties likely to meet the ad-
vertiser's views."
It is quite clear that
here is a case in which
“age before honesty” is
required in the character
of a clergyman. He must
be not less than seventy-
seven; or, in other words,
he must have one foot in
the grave; and as it is
quite impossible that, the
poor old victim will be
able to teach his parish-
ioners how to live, he
may at least make up for
the deficiency by teach-
ing them how to die very
speedily.
“His views must not
differ materially from
those of the Primate.”
The views of a poor old
- gentleman of seventy-
seven can scarcely give much trouble to his clerical superior. But at all events
the advertisement gives him a hint that if he does happen to have any convictions
of his own, he must let them remain exclusively his own, and keep them to
himself accordingly.
It is also “desirable that he should possess some small private means;” from
which it appears that the unfortunate veteran is not to expect from his benefice
enough to live upon. His “private means” must, however, be sufficiently “small”
to make his independence impossible. -
Though the clergyman of seventy-seven must subjugate his own views to those
of others, it is clear that the “patron” is resolved on a will of his own; for no

One of our objects, in calling attention to this disgraceful advertisement, is, to
give the “Primate,” whose name, or, rather, whose title, , is introduced on the
occasion, an opportunity of looking into it. We say nothing of the pecuniary
part of the business; for the surplus moneys of the Bishops appointed before 1848,
if retained at all, in opposition to the principles declared by the recent Order in
Council, will, of course, only be held in trust for objects of charity; and, espe-
cially, for the prevention of such scandals to the Church as are shown by an
advertisement requiring a clergyman, who is not to be paid from his benefice a
sufficient sum for his support, but who is expected to have private means to supply
the deficiency. The point to which we would direct the attention of the Bishop
of the diocese, is the age of the required incumbent, whose capacity for his duties

THE SUB-MARINE TELEGRAPH.
WE confess ourselves not a little disappointed at the non-carrying out—or,
rather, the carrying out and non-carrying home—of the sub-marine telegraph.
We had hoped to have been able to talk from London to our friends in Paris; and
though the voice employed would have been what the critics call wiry, or ropy, we
should have been perfectly satisfied. . We have been longing to see England and
France bound together by the tie of this extraordinary cable. The long and short
of it seems to be, that the rope is not long enough; and after “laying out twenty-
four miles,” two-thirds of a mile remain still due to enable the rope to meet its
engagements. It is a great pity that, while the manufacturers were spinning
a yarn, º should have stopped, short at the point of
interest; and though the incident does not exactly amount
to “spoiling the ship for a hap'orth of tar,” it realises the
idea of injuring the metal rope for a little copper.
NEW MANUAL FOR MILITARY SURGEONS.—
REVIEW.
“PUNch's OUTLINEs of MILITARY SURGERY.”—This
publication is from the pen of Mr. Punch, who reviews his
own book, in doing which he is not singular. The work
was called for by the Horse Guards Order, imposing the
duty of branding deserters on army surgeons. Fº is, as its
name may be said to imply, a treatise on the tracing of out-
lines on the surface of the human body; an art of which
the process of branding is an application. In it, however
the subject of branding, generally, is fully discussed; and
sound practical directions are given to military authorities
for inflicting a stigma or mark of disgrace upon an honour-
able profession. ... With reference, further, to the probable
transference of the other duties of the executioner to the
military medical man, the various methods of administering
corporal and capital punishment are also described; and it
may be affirmed that this volume will prove of material
assistance to the young operator, whilst learning how to
adjust the halter or to wield the cat. No mere book,
however, will afford ... the surgeon that qualification for
employment in the British Army, which, in accordance with
the views of the Profession entertained at head-quarters,
it will be incumbent on him, henceforth, to acquire from
clinical instruction in the school of Jack KETCH.
Mr. Punch does not, fail to call the attention of the
Medical Profession and the public to the fact, that the
tattoo, which has hitherto exclusively devolved on the
drummer, has now been allotted, in a great measure, to
the army surgeon.

HINTS ON DESPATCH WRITING.
(ILLUSTRATED BY EXAMPLES.)
Being Mr. Punch's Advice to a young General.
MY DEAR GENERAL,
As you are now leaving the important business of garrison duty,
and district inspection, for the still more arduous tºº. of a
colonial command, the following hints on one part of those responsi-
bilities may be useful to you. -
You may be aware—though, perhaps, I have"no right to presume so
much—that there are savages in the neighbourhood of the colony to
which your appointment takes you.
he existence of these savages renders it probable that you may
sooner or later find yourself engaged in a war. - -
The extension of British territories is, of course, an object which you
will never lose sight of. No colony can be comfortable with a horde of
savages on its frontier. .You will, therefore, of course keep perpetually
advancing that frontier into the district occupied by the native tribes.
It is true there will still be a frontier, and that the savages will still be
on the other side of it. . It is probable, also, that they will make an
obstinate resistance, and that your acquisitions, worthless in themselves
can only be purchased at a great sacrifice of money and men. You will
also hear it said by a disaffected colonial press, and echoed, perhaps, by
ical journals at home, that the existing frontier is a larger, one than
can be protected, that the ground you gain is barren sand, and that no
.* upon it can ever be safe from surprise by the dispossessed
natives.
I need not suggest the answers to shallow objections like these,
Savages know no argument but that of force, and a wholesome terror
of the British arms must be inspired. Besides, *...* regard for your
own professional prospects requires that you should do something in
your command, besides presiding at reviews, and writing general
orders. Without a war, you will have nothing to do, and without doing
something, you will have nothing to write to the Cºlonial Qffice about;
and without writing to the Colonial Office you will soon find yourself
shelved and forgotten. - - -
I take it for granted, therefore, that you will lose no time in getting

sumes the name, as well as the shape

specimen of the dastardly blow that has been
aimed at us?
“Why may a Curate hope to be a Bishop?”
-“Because he has a for-lawn hope!”
“Monster, away !” is the only reply we can
deign to one who has so far forgotten what is
due to himself and to society as to indite a
conundrum which would lay him open to an in-
dictment in the Court of Common Sense—which
is certainly not at Liverpool.

A PRETTY POLKA.

to meet you, and when he, comes, bully him. . He will probably retort,
and you may then punish him for his insolence. This will provoke
reprisals, which a regard for the credit of the British name will not
allow you to overlook. ... Or you may prefer the plan of recognising
native rights to the frontier territory, and insisting on the same recog-
nition from the out-camping settlers, which they will, no doubt, refuse;
whereupon the native landlord will, no doubt, distrain on their cattle;
and a quarrel is pretty safe to ensue, which will require an armed
interference on your part. -
The war once begun, you will, of course, keep it up with British
pertinacity, and prosecute it with British valour; and your efforts will,
º doubt, be crowned by that success which British valour rarely fails
O Secure.
But, as you, in your well-earned character of a thoroughly educated
soldier will, no doubt, prefer to adhere to the rules of regular warfare,
while your native adversaries will, no doubt, follow their own savage
fashion of fighting, you may occasionally meet with checks, and even
temporary discomfitures. These will furnish you with an opportunity
for displaying the qualities of the great general—I do not mean so
much in overcoming, as in reporting them.
Your literary training has probably been imperfect. But a general's
literary duties are by no means the least important nowadays. It is
an easy thing to conquer; but it is not so easy to report a defeat, so
that it reads like a victory. ---
I have no doubt of your capacity to get out of a dangerous position,
but I am not so sure that you can describe how you got into it, so as to
leave the impression that it was rather by a profound stratagetic move-
ment, than a humiliating blunder. -
It is this feeling which induces me to venture on giving you these
hints on the art of military composition. -
For proclamations and general orders, NApoleon is the great model.
Do not suppose, because f. commanded an army, and you manoeuvre
only three regiments, that his style would be unsuited to your position.
Follow the example of a recent Indian Commander-in-Chief, and always
say the least thing in the biggest words. The soldier likes to

Suppose, for example, your soldiers, have got into a slovenly habit of
taking off their stocks, which in a hot climate is very likely, your

and you enlist the imagination and esprit de corps of your troops
against an effeminate practice.
But it is in announcing checks, defeats, and those accidents which
ill occur in the best regulated armies, that your chief difficulty will be
found. The problem for you is to state the fact correctly, but so as in
all cases to save your own credit. This is, of course, to be done without
in any way risking that character for veracity which belongs to the
British soldier.
I should recommend to you, for this purpose, the study of M. Thiers's
work on the Consulate and the Empire, which, with a careful study of
all contemporary bulletins, you will find of great service.
Briefly, you will, perhaps, prefer examples to principles. Take
this case. You have advanced on the scene of the war. You can-
not find the enemy. Your men are suffering from heat, exposure,
want of water, want of food, and the other hardships inseparable from
a campaign. instead of saying—“We marched on such a day, but have
not yet come up with the enemy,” &c., &c., &c., you may express exactly
the same fact, in substance, but much more creditably to yourself and
your men, thus:-
“The Bo-gee tribe is in full retreat before us. Indeed, so precipitate
is their flight, that I have not yet been enabled to come up with them;
but I trust that my next despatch will enable me to announce that i
have inflicted on those treacherous savages the punishment they have
; merited, and which the brave troops under my command burn to
CU.
Here you will observe that an ingenious use is made of the anticipa-
tion of the great news your next despatch will contain. When the one
you are writing contains unpleasant intelligence, always pass from it as
soon as you can to the pleasant things you trust to announce in the one
you have not yet written.
If a tribe, by a feigned retreat, has drawn you into a barren and
difficult tract, in order that they may plunder, unmolested, in your rear,
. may even get credit by your i. if you describe it in this
style:—
“My movement in advance on the hill district of the Bo-gee tribe,
I am glad to say, has met with the success. I anticipated. KICK-A-
LILLI, their most formidable chief, is hemmed in, in the Rot Mountains;
and the brave troops under my command have borne down all resist-
ance in the advance. I am not able to report the taking of all their
eattle, as this region is so barren that none have been driven here; but
I trust that the operations of Colon EL SweLTER, on the plains beyond
º º Pooloo, will result in the capture of enormous herds of cattle
and sheep.
“KICK-A-LILLI is, I have no doubt, most anxious to treat; but,
with the usual dissimulation of these º he has not yet taken any
step which might betray this, anxiety. But his desperate position
cannot be maintained much longer; and the rapid and successful
invasion of this, the most inaccessible part of the Boºgee district, by
the British arms, will, I feel persuaded, convince this observant savage
of the hopelessness of further resistance.
“The health of the troops, I regret to say, is indifferent; but nothing
can surpass their steadiness under fire, and I trust soon to prove this
in an encounter with the skulking foe.
“Of course, the advance of the troops left the frontier to some extent
open, and advantage has been taken of this by some of the outlying
tribes near the Scut river to make a foray on the British settlements.
They have now, however, retreated, terrified, no doubt, by the news of
º ºtions in this quarter, and carrying with them some 6000 head
of cattle.
“I should have despatched that most intelligent and active officer,
MAJoR SQUABASH, after these wretched plunderers, but the necessity
of striking a vigorous blow at this crisis of the war has hitherto pre-
vented me. I trust, however, in my next despatch to announce the
utter annihilation of these marauders, and the restoration of their booty
to its owners. This will, in all probability, conclude the war, and I am
glad to think that my advance on the hill district will have conduced to
an end so glorious to British valour.
“The conduct of the officers and men under my command is beyond all
praise. To Colon EL Swelter, MAJOR SquaBASH, CAPTAINs Toozey
and MAccoollup, and all the subalterns engaged under them, I am
lad to have an opportunity of directing the attention of your Excel-
º No words can describe the value of the services rendered to me
by these officers, without exception. The men also have been admirable.
The only difficulty has been to restrain their ardour amid the dangers and
difficulties of this arduous campaign, and to encourage them in the
pursuit of an enemy whose miserable pusillanimity did not allow him
once to show himself.”
Now, who but a man accustomed to this sort of thing, would ever
guess, from this description, that you had been humbugged, hood-
winked, and drawn on to the ruin of the colony by the very savages
you fling so much ink at
This, I take it, is the object to be kept in view.
Of course you must be prepared for the grumbling of Colonial mal-
contents. But do not let that discourage you. It is the lot of every
faithful servant of the Colonial Office.
And provided that your despatches are so worded as to stand the
scrutiny of newspaper-readers, you need not apprehend anything from
the sternness of official criticism. The Office are quite sensible of the
duty that lies upon them of º their servants in their too often
thankless duties, and all they ask in return is that their servants should
do as much for the Office. . Then, as for the troops under your.com-
mand, only take care to praise everybody, and nobody will be dissatisfied.
Attention to these hints, will, I trust, ensure for you a glorious com-
mand, and a good pension. En Attendant,
Believe me, my dear HoRNBLower, with best wishes,

How to Wash out a Horse's Mouth.
THE following is the mode in which the mouth of an omnibus horse
is usually washed out, while the passengers are kept waiting.
The driver, having drawn up at a public-house, descends from his
box, and retires with the conductor into the bar, where a pot of porter
is called for. Both drink, alternately till the whole is finished, when
the driver resumes his seat, the conductor his perch; and the horses'
mouths are to be considered as “washed out,” to all intents and
purposes.

passages:-
“I sit here, my dear MACAss, and see the people go by to the Exhi-

a dozen rush-bottomed
chairs gave promise that
the stage was about to
be graced by a “goodly

full of water, and six
tumblers, stood on a

the tumblers could not

great as if the promised
performance had been a Christmas pantomine. - -

debted either to nature or burnt, cork—and we leave the parties to
settle their claims in the court of the young gentleman's own conscience
—rushed on to the stage, and striking his hand upon his heart,
indicated emergetically that that was the place upon which to touch a
British audience. The appeal was met by silence; for when did an
apologist punch his white waistcoat in vain, or plant his fist on his own
ribs, without giving a dig, at the same time, to a body of impatient
Englishmen? " He appealed for a little delay, which was granted, and
in a few minutes, the Bloomers, in a body of twelve, running—like a set
of jugs—in sizes, made their appearance amid that laughter and cheer-
ing, which are the signs by *. John Bull invariably indicates his
sense of the ludicrous.
The Bloomers had been announced as a Committee, and we were sur-
rised to find such an early aptitude for business in young ladies
etween the ages of seven and eleven; for there were at least three or
four of the Committee who were evidently in the early milk-and-water-
hood of extreme juvenility. A middle-aged matronly Bloomer, with a
good-humoured twinkle in her eye, as if she could see and relish the
absurdity of the whole business, occupied a chair in the centre, while
under her wings clustered the younger Bloomers; some trying to look
very demure; others on the point of going off into one of those bursts
of nature in which a º to laugh is incontrollable. The very
young Bloomers looked rather frightened until the self-possession of an
American lady, who seemed to be the only genuine Bloomer of the
party, appeared to re-assure the whole of them. Pouring out a glass of
water, she proposed “Success to the Cause,” amid †† loud
and unanimous as if the toast had been the health of the Queen, long
life to Punch, or any other ſavourite sentiment of the British people.
Amrious to give Bloomerism fair play, we would have scrutinised the
dress; but there were so many varieties, that we found ourselves even
more perplexed than the looker-on at the peep-show representation of
the exploits of NAPOLEoN and the Duke of WELLINGTON. We would
have inquired on the spot, “Which is the Bloomer costume P’” but a
dread of the º. Whichever you please, my little dear,” put a curb
on our tongue, if not upon our curiosity.
Bloomerism, as represented by the Committee, consisted of nothin
but rather short petticoats, with the usual schoolgiri trousers fastene
at the ankle, and the old original Adelaide boots, with which the eye of
the commonest observer must be familiar. There was an attempt at more
orthodox Bloomerism on the part of one of the Committee, aged about
fourteen, who wore a hat, in which she was curbed up with terrible
tightness under the chin, and a brown jacket slightly slashed, after the
fashion of a peasant descending the mountainous platforms of our
operatic scenery.
The American lady proceeded with her lecture in favour of Bloomerism,
the gist of which seemed to be, that short petticoats are a high moral
º º

º: easy. She contended for the necessity of female emancipation,
ut as we have always considered our own sex to be the slaves, we, of
course, were unable to see the force of the reasoning of the fair
lecturer. She promised a tremendous accession of physical energy to
the ladies if they once get into trousers; but this looks so like a knock-
down argument, that we are not very willing to admit the force of it.
the course of the lecture, there was a shuffling at the wing, and a
fresh accession of Bloomers made their appearance, amid cheers and
laughter, which reached the highest point of excitement when a veteran
Bloomer, in black, with worsted stockings, high-lows, and a black beaver
bonnet, something between a Mary Stuart, a wide-awake, and a cottage,
skipped forward with a short quick step, and a smiling but peculiarly
comic countenance. The lecturer had just been insisting that it was
from no idle vanity the dress was adopted, when her position received
the accidental illustration we have alluded to. The veteran Bloomer
was accommodated with a chair in the centre of the stage, and acknow-
ledged, with a good-humoured cock of her eye, the cheerful salutations
of the audience.
The lecturer concluded by thanking those present for their attention;
but she innocently expressed surprise that some of her hearers should
have been rude enough to laugh—a proof that she knew little of John
BULL, who would receive Socrates himself with a roar, if he were to
come forward to lecture on the subject she had chosen. A British
ublic will listen to reason and hear information; but it must have its
augh with, or at-it does not matter which—something, or somebody.
The performance terminated with “God save the Queen,” by a sort of
Demi-Semi-Bloomer, who had only bloomed slightly about the ankles,
but in no other respect gave indications of even a budding propensity.
The Committee of Bloomers were as inharmonious in their chorus-sing-
ing as in their dress, for nearly every one adopted a different line of the
national anthem, as each pursued a different line in respect to the
Bloomer costume. Unanimity was not obtained even at the second
verse, notwithstanding a preliminary cry from the audience of “Now
then—all together this time !”—a hint that was quite lost on the
Bloomers, who had each a different note, as each
a different cut and material. When they are agreed among -
what the Blooner costume really is, we shall be able to give sufficient
reasons for not adopting it.
THE BALLAD OF SWEET DIZZY AND THE FAIR
MAID PROTECTION.
(From our private copy of PERCY’s “Reliques.”)
Two lovers sate, on a summer's day,
In the shade of an ancient thorn,
And they saw the pleasant breezes play
Through the un-protected corn.
“I see no harm by you, fair maid,
And you see none by me: .
Before long, a Duty shall be paid
For your thumping dow-e-ry!”
Protection sate at her bower-window,
Watching her yellow crops;
She saw sweet Dizzy with Lady Free Trade,
Pass by from the nearest copse.
She rose up quick from the bower-window;
She threw BULwer's pamphlet by :
sº. with a groan, to the darkened room
ere the queer statistics lie.
And all in the lonely midnight time,
Past the lonely peeler's tread,
Up came the Spirit of that fair maid,
And stood at Dizzy's bed:
“And are you awake, sweet Dizzy " she said;
“Or, sweet Dizzy, are you asleep?
Heaven send you grace ºyour gay Free Trade,
And me of the Standard’s sheet.”
+ * * *
Protection, she died on one day,
Sweet Dizzy on the morrow;
Protection, she died of true, true love;
Sweet Dizzy died of sorrow.
Tº buried them both in the queer old street
here the politicians talk;
And from her grave there grew some wheat,
From his, a cotton-stalk.
They É. and grew, and gain'd the top
Of BARRY's new Houses' spire;
And there they tied in a true-love knot,
Which made the country admire.

THE ROMANCE OF THE MARKETS.
We know of nothing so sentimental in the columns of a daily news-
paper as the article devoted to the state of the markets. We seldom
peruse it without a tendency to tears, which are only checked by the
recollection that it is only on bags of coffee, bales of cotton, parcels
of pepper, and sacks of flour, that we are exhausting our useless
sº
We, however, defy any one to be otherwise than moved by the
description of the markets, which is evidently the production of a
writer who luxuriates in a strain of melancholy tenderness, that is
excluded by universal consent from every other portion of the news-
paper. The literary sentimentalist finding no market among the book-
sellers for his goods, has gone to the very markets themselves, and has
secured a corner in the journals, where he may indulge without restraint
his tendency to pathos.
Let us take a specimen of that affecting style of writing, which has
found its way, appropriately enough, to Mincing Lane, ever since the
mincing manner has been banished from the publications put forth
by the West-end publishers.
“An improved feeling had again begun to show itself in the coffee-market, where
dulness had until lately prevailed, and sugars began to assume a livelier aspect."
Surely this must be written by some fashionable novelist “out of
huck,” whose Rosa MATILDA-IsMs, that once used to cloy the circula-
ting libraries with their sweetness, have rushed to the sugar cask as
the only alternative to avoid the butter-shop. Substitute AUGUSTU's
DANVERs for the “coffee-market,” insert Rosa Lie in the place of
“sugars,” and we get a sentence that would seem to form part of a
sentimental novel of ten years back, when the writers of the same sort
of stuff could command their three or five hundred pounds for an
adequate lot of it. The paragraph, as amended, will stand thus:
“An improved feeling had again begun to show itself in Augustus DANvrºns (the
coffee-market), where dulness had until lately prevailed, and Rosalie (sugars) began to
assume a livelier aspect.”
We know nothing of the mysteries of what is termed, the “staff.”
of a daily paper; but we certainly picture to ourselves the writer of
the markets, as a pale gentleman, with a forehead shaved up to its
highest, a Byron tie, a turned-down shirt collar, and a melancholy cast
of countenance. We can imagine him walking moodily about the
markets, looking out anxiously for a glimpse of gloom in sugaº, and
feeling an indescribable satisfaction in the dulness of peppers. Why is
it necessary that Wool should be “flat,” Bengal figs “low,” Indigo
“dull,” Rice “depressed,” and everything that seems nice and eatable
so wretchedly low-spirited? It is seldom we meet with a bit of sensible
“firmness” in something or other; but, even if we do, we are told of
a “tendency to give way,” before we get to the end of the article.
We earnestly entreat our daily contemporaries to get rid of the dull
sentimental dogs who howl and moan over the markets, and put them
into the hands of some of the more lively writers, of whom there is no
lack on all the newspaper establishments. We can never venture to
look at the markets in any of the morning papers without feeling a con-
sciousness that our spirits are going to be damped by some details of
“dulness” here, “lowness” there, and “a feeling of depression”
everywhere, in which we are only too ready to sympathise.
Electric Compliments.
THE laying down of the Submarine Telegraph is to be inaugurated
by a fête.
“Paixon Albret is to flash an electric spark from London, which is to fire off a
cannon at the Invalides; and Louis NAeoleon, by the same means, is to fire off a
cannon at the Tower of London.”
And in order to give a double significance to the ceremony, the gun
of PRINCE ALBERT will proclaim to Paris the arrival of Kossuth in
England; whilst the gun of Louis NApoleon will publish the de-
parture of ABD-EL-KADER from France.
THE SEYMOUR MOTTO.
WE have it now upon the authority of the Times, that it is the motto
of Lord Sey Moun “to do nothing until he is forced, and then to do
as little as possible.” This speaks, the determination of the animal
enshrined in the ballad; the identical animal... that wouldn't go,” until
forced, and then, as little way as possible. Wits jump!
EIouse of Commons Relics.
SoME of the benches of the old House of Commons have been
purchased by an imaginative unholsterer, who proposes to work them
up into easy chairs, warranted to provide sleep for any sitters, together
with bedsteads that shall impart a sweet oblivion to whomsoever may
lie in them, however great their difficulties, and whatever the confusion

SUDDEN INDISPOSITION OF THE FRENCEI
TELEGRAPH.
EALLY no popular, singer is so
subject to sudden indisposi-
tions as the French Tele-
graph. There is never any-
thing of importance to com-
municate, but it is sure to be
laid up with some timely com-
plaint, that deprives it of the
use of its limbs. The great
cause of its many illnesses
seems to be the fog. No over-
aid Prima Donna in Eng-
and has been so often.“ In:
terromp, par le Brouillard”
as the French Telegraph.
An interruption of this
sort occurred the other day,
when Kossuth wished to
travel through France. The
Telegraph was entrusted with the message that had to be carried up to
the French President. About half way, a violent cramp seized its hands
and arms, and prevented it pointing a single finger, excepting the
finger of scorn, which people say they saw the Telegraph deliberately
point in the direction of the Elysée. A fog was the cause of this sudden
paralysis; and we have no doubt that Louis NAPOLEoN would see many
more things, which, if he were wise, he should see, if it were not for
the tremendous fogs in which his reason apparently delights in losing
itself. The fog in question lasted some four or five days—which is the
more curious, as fogs are not in the habit generally of stopping at a
place so long in the month of September. England, even—which we
always thought was the pays de prédilection of all fogs—is rarely
favoured with so prolonged a stay. However, it must be very con-
venient to have a fog always at one's command; and, to do Louis
NAPoleon justice, he rarely throws one away; for he understands the
art of keeping. France in a perpetual fog, as well as one who has
H. him in pulling the strings of Government, or the French
elegraph.
But when this wooden old Telegraph is done away with—for electricity
must soon splinter its crazy limbs into a thousand pieces—what will he
do then P. He will miss his affectionate fog. He will not be able to
say that the Electric Telegraph was “Interrompu par le Brouillard ” for
a whole week . Some new fog will have to be blown into the people's
eyes. It will be a flock of geese which has snapped all the wires, or
some thievish bell-hanger who has stolen them, or perhaps the galvanic
battery will be found too ill to work. A “sudden indisposition ” of
some sort will be found somewhere, if only to support the ancient repu-
tation of the French Telegraph. In the meantime, a number of cele-
brated physicians should be appointed to watch over it, with stringent
fear of its catching cold. If some such precaution is not taken, we
shall be having the result of next year's election “Interrompu par le
Brouillard,” which would be very provoking at a time when Louis
NAPOLEoN would wish to see his way perfectly clear through France;
though, on the other side, the greater the fog, the greater the President's
chances of re-election, as the people would be prevented from scruti-
nising too closely his claims to the office.
A TERRIBLE AND PROPHETIC SILENCE.
THE Times gives the following from its “own” Italian correspondent,
relative to the reception of the Austrian Emperor in Italy:-
“An eye-witness, a military man, assures me that the silence of the Milanese was
terrifying. When the Emperor was at the theatre at Verona, but one Italian lady of
distinction was present.”
What says the Italian poet, ALFIERI, of silence?
“Silenzio, figlia d'alta vendetta / "
“Silence, the daughter of deep vengeance!”
Such silence—let FRANCIs Joseph be assured of it—was at Milan
and elsewhere.
Many a True Word said in Jest.
WHEN we recollect how many broken-winded horses have been
employed in the omnibuses during the Exhibition, we are struck by the
literal truth of the remark, that the proprietors have been driving a
“roaring” trade. ,

WHAT SHALL BE DONE UNTO THE SULTAN ?
CITIES, and towns, and boroughs, are assembling to do congratulating
honour to KossuTH. Well and good—but what shall be done unto the
Sultan, who, at his own peril, harboured and comforted the patriot,
defying the beaks and talons of the double-headed Eagle ... Poor fare
was it for the carnivorous, obscene bird, to try to glut itself T. that
hard bit of board—hung a short while since at Pesth-with Kossuth
painted upon it. Tasteless, unsatisfactory food—literally dry as
chip!—Hard, indeed, for the bird to make a meal of a bit of wood,
flavoured at the best with resin or turpentine, when it might have had
the heart of Kossuth for its garbage; and would have had, but for
the gallant Abdul MEDJID, the Infidel Sultan, who manfully defied
a Most Christian Emperor.
And therefore, What shall be Done unto the Turk? Punch makes
answer:
Let every city, every town, straightway send to the Sultan some
fitting, significant Testimonial. What can iondon do? Well, his
Sublimity, to be sure, will never, need it; but London, might send him
her freedom, in a great gold box. No revolution is likely to cast
ABDUL MEDJID from his throne, flying as ABDUI, SMITH a-down the
Bosphorus, to take his seat in England; or rather his stand, with
Turkey rhubarb, in Cheapside. Hence, the golden box, though con:
taining the right of opening a shop, would be of no intrinsic value of
citizenship; nevertheless, i. the gold box, with, the civic freedom
beautifully painted and engrossed by Owen joNEs, be forthwith sent.
And Birmingham shall make a sword for the Sultan: a sword with
Koran texts, teaching human mercy to the fallen, lººp to the
helpless, gleaming on the blade. And the handle shall be of copper;
solid copper, wrought from the penny-pieces of the English million.
Manchester ...; weave the Sultan curtains, wherein shall be told the
story of his beneficent doings—curtains for the Turk's Divan' -
Sheffield shall send him razors—with handles of British oak, exqui-
sitely carved—for his noble head. -- -
From every town of the United Kingdom let there be some testi-
monial—however small—straightway voted for the Sultan. A park of
artillery cannot be too large a present (he may want it), a pocket
revolver too small a one. - - - - -
And when every city and every town have made their individual
offering, then let there be collected throughout the length and breadth
of the country, subscriptions, no matter how much or how little, so
that the total be large, as large it must be.
let a three-decker be built, rigged, armed, and provisioned. And let
this ship be manned, for the occasion, by British tars. "And as the ship
sails into the Bosphorus, let the Turkish guns answer the salute of
“THE Kossuth ; three-decker, a thanks-offering of the People of
England to the gallant ABDUL MEDJID, the Sultan of the Turks.’
And in this way—according to Punch—should honour be done to him
who preserved KossuTH, and defied FRANcis Joseph.
THE MAIDA-HILL NO-MOVEMENT.
RUMoURs have reached us by the last omnibus which arrived—over
due-from Maida-hill, that considerable agitation exists in the neigh-
bourhood, on the subject of the isolated position of the place, and that
a separate legislature is even spoken of in some quarters. We can
scarcely be surprised at even flis insane idea having got about in a
district, maddened by a sort of forced separation from the rest of the
civilised world, and dependent for occasional intercourse with it on the
rare and fitful efforts of a dilatory body of 'bus-rangers. We have,
however, reason to hope that a closer approximation will speedily take
place, by virtue of some arrangements now in progress, for expediting
the means of transit, and that besides looking upon the Maida-hillians
as men and brothers, we shall be able to regard them in the still nearer
light of neighbours, and visitors. We have long thought it a fearful
#. that Maida-hill should be severed from the rest of us by a
isgraceful species of 'bus craft.

THE POLICE AND THE PEOPLE.
It is evident that the police are beginning to take that place in the
affections of the people—we don’t mean the cooks and housemaids only,
but the people at large—that the soldiers and sailors used to occupy.
In the old war-time there was a sort of enthusiasm for the “blue
jackets,” the defenders of the country; but in these happier days of
ce, the blue coats—the defenders of order—are becoming the national
avourites. - -
Veterans, whose boast it used to be to have distinguished themselves
at the lines of Torres Vedras, find their glories eclipsed by those whose
pride it is to have been present and performed good service at the lines
of omnibuses and cabs going to and from the Crystal Palace. The
taking of a foreign fort seems to sink into insignificance before the
taking of a refractory cabman's number—for the simple reason, that
we do not want and do not care for foreign forts; but our comfort
very much depends on the good behaviour of our native cabmen.
Military engineering has been nothing to the engineering difficulties
that have been surmounted by our police force in effecting the passage
of the crossings, and carrying elderly females with their stores and
baggage from one side of the way to the other. Every one has been
charmed during the Great Exhibition by the mode in which this truly
civil power has been rendered effective; and if England expected, she
has not been disappointed in the expectation, that every policeman
should be every day on duty.
We should not be surprised to find the soldiers and sailors of the
stage displaced from their position as heroes of some of the stock
dramas, and superseded by the more, peaceful heroes of the bull's-eye
and baton. Our adapters will probably be setting to work very soon
on the alteration of the old play of the Recruiting Serjeant into the
Police Serjeant; and the little interlude of the Poor Soldier will possibly
be revived somewhere or other under the new and more attractive title
of the Poor Policeman. Our nautical drama will be superseded by a
new order of production, in which, instead of My Poll and my Partner
Joe, we shall be having My Cook and my Inspector Jones; and The Lass
that Lores a Sailor, with a few alterations, may be revived as The Gal
that Lores a Peeler.
Some modern DIRDIN will, no doubt, be found to respond to the
national feeling towards the gallant class which has lately taken such a
high position in public regard; and by way of encouragement to other
poets, some of whom, by the way, are only too ready to copy, and too
often, alas! to disfigure, while pilfering, any new idea we throw out-
we give the following specimen of a song in honour of the Police
Force:—
JACK ROUGH.
Suggested by Dibdin's Naval Song of “ToM Tough.”
My name, d'ye see, 's JACK Rough; I’ve seen a little duty,
Where Chartists used to throng, and stones sometimes throw ;
I’ve had a crack or two that have rather spoiled my beauty;
And in many a street I’ve cried—“Come, move on there ! Now go!”
I’ve served, too, in addition,
... . inside the Exhibition,
And with SUPERINTENDENT PEARSE have paraded to and fro;
And sometimes had to jog
, , . An old lady at her grog,
As I smiled in her face with my “Move on! Go!”
When from my Cook to part I first weighed anchor,
And she was smiling down in the area below,
For the meat and bread and butter I paused first to thank her,
But I jumped upon the pavement with my “Move on Go!”
Policemen, though exposed to jokes,
Love meat and bread like other folks,
Though their § they mustn't neglect, they know;
So I seized my truncheon new,
- ... Like a Peeler true,
And in ". of care sung out, “Who’s there?—you must move
on Go! ”
And now at last retired with a pretty decent pension,
Which is due to long service, as all men know,
I keep myself away from all strife and contention,
And never say to nobody “Move on Go!”
So I takes my pipe, and as I smokes,
I crack again the oldest jokes,
That I learned, when in the force, from facetious JoE.

A ForgotteN FEAST.-A feast in the Crystal Palace to the work-
men who built it.
PAPA, AND FREEDOM OF OPINION |
You should read PAPA’s Allocution. It is published in that nice
§." the Tablet. In it, PAPA says how kind he has been to his “most
ear Daughter,” MARIA ELIZABETH. You know that MARIA ELIZA-
BETH is the QUEEN OF SPAIN. PAPA tells us that his religion “is so
singly as heretofore to flourish and be dominant” in Spain, “that every
other worship is altogether removed and interdicted.” He shows us
what a dutiful l)aughter MARIA ELIZABETH is, in having promised to
help his good Bishops to restrain those naughty men who try to “per-
vert the minds of the faithful,” and also when the Bishops “shall have
to scatter and drive away from their flocks the detestable and dire
plague, and ruinous evil of perverse books.” How happy MARIA
ElizaBETH must be to have such a good PAPA, and how glad the
Spaniards must feel that, their QUEEN’s PAPA has given them dear
Bishops to drive away the naughty books that contradict all their
favºri!e winking pictures, and teach them not to worship pretty
Images :
Then PAPA also describes what a good boy his “most beloved Son,”
LEopold II., GRAND DUKE of Tuscany and DUKE OF LUCCA,
been, in asking PAPA to settle his laws as to Church matters for him;
and how PAPA has rewarded him for being so good. PAPA says
that his Bishops in Tuscany, too, are to “exercise censorship, over
writings and works which treat of things relating to religion.” Should
}. not like to live in Tuscany, with no -
ACON to put nasty reason into your head, and no wicked Punch to
find fault with poor PAPAf
PAPA ends by saying that he has great hope that a “convention”
ood-for-nothing LocKE and
may be entered into, which may answer the purposes and prosperity of
PAPA’s Church “in a distant region.” PAPA means this country. Do
you not wish PAPA may get it
In the very same Tablet that PAPA’s Allocution appears in, there is
also published an Address to all PAPA’s children in Great Britain and
Ireland, signed “PAUL, ARCHBISHOP of ARMAGH,” and “WILLIAM
KEOGH,” two of PAPA’s big boys. -
funny resolution passed at a meeting of a society which PAUL and
WILLIAM, belong to, and which society has been got up between them
and their brothers, on º to defend PAPA’s cause. The resolution
says, that the society pled
of Parliament that have - -
object the maintenance of civil and religious liberty in the British empire.”
Of course, PAUL and WILLY, and their society, do not mean the
liberty to believe and teach what you please, by “civil and religious
liberty.” If they said they did, they would tell stories:
Irish boy, especially if he is a true son of his PAPA, ever tells. They
mean the liberty to believe and teach what PAPA pleases, and nothing
else. And, if they could have their way, PAPA would be able to make
magistrates and judges restrain the naughty people that “pervert the
minds of the faithful,” and we should be blessed with dear BISHOPs,
with the lovely law to back them, “scattering and driving away
perverse books,” and “exercising censorship” over the paw-paw press.
And so we should have no more fie-fie books about divinity, and
philosophy, and history, and astronomy, and geology, and chemistry,
and physiology. -
And then, if John NY Bull would be a good boy, and own his PAPA,
and obey him, PAPA would give him a pretty string of beads to play
with, and a lot of salt fish, ină some nice images to amuse him, instead
! i. * books, and a little rod to whip himself with, and Fºx's
O8 to KISS.
Ramshay Translated into German.
[Private and Confidential.]
WE understand that the Ambassador for Austria, anticipating a
change in the fortunes of MR. RAMSHAY, Liverpool County Court
Judge, has taken upon his excellent self to offer MR. R. a post in the
Law Courts of Vienna, with letters of naturalisation. Persons ag-
quainted with MR. RAMSHAY believe that the bracing air of Austria
would be far more constitutional for the learned gentleman than the
mild atmosphere of Liverpool. With a few RAMSHAYs, the EMPEROR
might snap his fingers at half-a-dozen KossuTHs.
SYMPTOMS OF A SEVERE WINTER.

THE LAST NIGHT IN THE CRYSTAL PALACE,
THE time is close on midnight; above the roof of glass
With a tremulous touch of silver the Autumn Moon doth pass;
Now with paly fire uplighting a stretch of crystal wall,
And anon her level glories on the Transept letting fall:
But with the night she waneth, and her lamp is getting low,
And her fair head she hath hooded, forth from the sky to go;
But timidly, and tenderly, she first hath raised her veil,
To press a fond and farewell kiss on the Statuefaces pale,
That in the Crystal Palace look down so chaste and chill, . .
Now the º: have ceased their booming, and the groaning gongs
are sºl
And for buzz of myriad voices, and tramp of myriad feet,
There reigns so deep a silence you may hear your own heartbeat.
'Twas in this awful silence Istood within the place,
And thought of all this toiling and triumph of my race;
, ,
| Of the weary stretch of ocean, the weary waste of shore,
- º º: That for this wondrous gathering must have been travelled o'er;
\; - º What toiling hands and thinking heads; what wealth, and want,
and woe; - -
What hopes and fears, and joys and griefs, have joined to make
the show; -
How, under contribution, my country, strong of will, -
Hath laid both forge and workshop, quarry, and mine, and mill;
How into Art’s high studio she hath come with bold demand,
And all she found there worthiest, hath swept from every land:
Through the wide field of Nature hath sent labourers everywhere,
To garner up the harvest of water, earth, and air:
How, not recking creed or colour, her summons she sent forth
From African Saharas, to the snow-fields of the North;
And how, with hand all weaponless, and with a naked breast,
She folded in her great embrace the whole World for a guest—
And my heartswell'd high with thankful pride that I was England's son,
When came the sad and sudden º: 's done must be undone !
That the day now on its closing the last day was to be,
That those flood-gates would open to let in their human sea;
That with to-morrow's sunrise the mighty trophy falls,
Reared by the Industry of Earth within these crystal walls.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
I75
Sad with this thought, I measured the nave with heavy pace, -
When the great pulse of midnight throbb’d solemn through the place,
And the beat of the last stroke was still booming in my ear,
When all was life and motion, of a sudden, far and near.
There was rustling of draperies, and slamming of doors,
Tossing of naperies, and creaking of floors,
There were metals a-ringing, pianos a-singing,
And harps of themselves obligatos a-stringing,
And furniture tumbling, and organ-pipes rumbling,
And awkward machines o'er each other a-stumbling,
And glasses a-crashing, and porcelain a-smashing,
And bronze candelabra through mirrors a-dashing,
And carpets, and floor-cloths, a-rolling themselves up,
And dresses a-folding their breadths on their shelves up—
In short, such a shindy, and rumpus, and riot
Burst out all at once on the night and the quiet,
That, my bacon to save, I fled down the nave,
When I saw—all at once—pray don't fancy Irave,
The Statues in motion.—Have you e'er seen a Statue,
In the moonlight, at midnight—a-coming right at you?
Down from her horse swung the Amazon bold,
The Lioness dropped, much relieved, from her hold;
And the Horse gave a shake, as if thankful to break
From the pose he’d been forced for a six months to take.
Then tripped up the nave HIRAM Powen's Greek Slave,
, In a Bloomer costume, most provokingly grave;
* And Montº's sweet Vestal came swaſhed in her veil,
Peeping out from its wrappings, so pensive and pale,
Like a belle from the crush-room or ball, º: Warm-
And, oh! how I longed just to offer my arm'
Mother Eve from the wall whipped a large India shawl,
And folded herself up the closest of all.
And here, with a clank, fit to stave in each plank,
Came, with HAGEN and GUNTHER, the §.. rank.
And sans-culottes Cupids, a plump little throng,
From the Milanese Room, trundled, scampering along,
Not heeding poor VENUs, who begg’d and beseech'd
They’d comeback, like dear good little boys, to be breech'd.
Down came “ELDoN’” and “Stow ELL,” both stiff with the gout,
And I heard “ELDon’’ whisper, while looking about,
With a shrug “Humph! No good will come of it, I doubt?”
At last, lest I might be by accident crush'd
By the Statues that hitherward, thitherward, rush'd,
I made myself small, and shrank into a nook,
And plucked up a heart on the chaos to look:
When all was suddenly still as before—
The movement in each compartment was o'er,
And a shadowy form stood at every door!
And something within reveal’d to me
'Twas the Spirit of each land's Industry,
Which had gather'd itself from the objects there,
And now stood reveal’d to my wondering stare...i
France I knew, by the red cap she wore,
And the tatter'd and trailing tricolor:
Austria, by her scowl of pride
On sad, sweet Italy, crouch'd by her side:
Russia, by crown barbaric of mould,—
All m ite and Ural gold:
Germany, by her flag outspread,
With its motley of yellow, and black, and red;
Which Prussia slyly strove to hold back,
Protruding before it her white and black:
Switzerland stood like a mountain queen,
Sturdy of limb, and free of mien:
# broad-based Holland, half fish, half maid,
ith rudder, and oar, and dyking-spade;
While Denmark and Sweden were NortNAs fair,
With ice-blue eyes and amber hair;
America full well I knew,
By her stars, and stripes, and her Eagle, too,
But her hand held a scourge, and her back show'd scars, " .
And somehow the stripes seem'd to dim the stars;
Persia, on her cushions lying,
Her almond eyes with kohl was dyeing:
And Turkey, a slipper'd and shrouded dame,
Flash’d from her yashmac a glance of flame;
While India show'd, with a lazy grace,
From shawls and muslins, a dusky face,
Large eyes half of languor, and half of light,
And a brow that blazed with the Koh-i-Noor's light.
But in stature far above the rest, I mark'd one spirit tower,
The spirit of my own England—a spirit of peace and power:
Her eyes were deep and clear of look, and placid was her cheek;
And in her bearing that high calm to which all else is weak;
And as I bow’d before her, her chaste lips oped to speak:-
“Son, but now I heard a murmur in that shallow heart of thine,
That this gathering of wonders must henceforth no more be mine;
And a º thing to thy folly it appear'd to scatter forth
All * ºrd fruits of labour, East and West, and South and
orth.
Know, vain heart, it is not only what they brought unto my shore
That my guests will take back with them—poorer were they than before;
No, a store of mighty import will with each and all return,
Till the world shall by the scattering—more than by the gathering—earn.
As the seeds of costly spice-trees by the Indian birds are spread,
So, by all my guests returning, precious seeds will wide be shed;
Seeds of peace, good-will to nations—seeds of useful arts untried,
With whose growths the world hereafter will be glad from tide to tide.”
The deep voice ceased: and, when I raised my head,
Grey morn sat in the East, and I was smuga-bed!
DIFFERENT WIEWS OF THE BLOOMER COSTUME.
(Delivered without prejudice to the real merits of the Question.)
ON'T a lady's dress of the present day
take so many º to make up
—according to the taste of the
wearer?—but, with the Bloomer
costume, I should be sorry to say to
what lengths, the lady, who wears
it, might feel inclined to go toº-
Žn Indignant Milliner.
“Should the Bloomer costume be
adopted, petticoats will go out, and
petticoats going out, there may be
an end, at last, to Petticoat Go-
vernment —of which no one will be
more heartily rejoiced than’—The
Hen-Pecked Husband.
“’Ere’s the jolly good health of
the Bloomer costume! For I tell
you what, BILL, our Bus, with all
the shaking in the world, won't
carry, more than sixteen ladies,
ack 'em as tight as you will; but
} find that it will take twenty
Bloomers comfurrably, and allow
each on ’em a Bloomer Baby on
the lap! It's the dress, my boy,
vot makes the difference.”—The
*Bus Conductor.
*Oh, dear! how delightful it will be for jumping over the stiles!”-
The Fast Young Lady.
“I’m in favour of the new costume; because if my wife bothers me
for a new dress, I shall refer her to the tailor, and I can make out a
tailor's bill, and I know all his prices; whereas Idefy any man to under-
stand a milliner’s.”—The Mean Husband.
“This new dress will take all opposition off the road—for, really, the
long dresses of the ladies swept everything so clean, that there was
nothing left for us to clear away after them. In short, I look upon the
Bloomer as the very best friend to the Broomer.”—The Street Orderly.
“I don’t care how my girls dress, as long as they dress º:
but I am sure—as sure as quarter-day—that they will hang on to the
skirts of this new Bloomer costume—that is to say, if it has any skirts
—if it is only for the sake of getting a new dress: for I never knew
any girl of mine let a new dress slip through her fingers when she had
a chance of getting one.”—The Good-natured Papa.
-
The Senate and the Circus.
It is a wonder that La Patrie, or some other French newspaper, has
not adverted to the “East Riding Election,” as an instance of John
BULL's irreverent humour, supposing it to be an equestrian burlesque ||
on our representative system, performed at BATTy’s.

THE CONSTITUTION DEAD AGAIN.
THE eels at Billingsgate are accustomed to the inconvenience of
being skinned; they merely twist and wriggle a little more or less, and
there an end. The British Constitution is used to death—at the
hands of Whigs or Radicals. It has been murdered outright twent
times within our memory; and is about to be killed again. England,
instead of having the Lion and Unicorn for her arms, should bear Three
Cats; this would give her seven-and-twenty accredited lives, so that,
after the next life taken by LoRD JoHN RUssell, England, with the
twenty already lost, might have, six more to spare; which, with
moderation, might last our time. The Quarterly again weeps drops of
ink over the threatened death of the Constitution, a death menaced by
the Russell Reform Bill of next session: -
“And it is at this moment—this awful moment of doubt—while not monarchy only,
but even republics, are trembling before an invading democracy, that Lord John
Russell has had the weakness, or the rashness, to announce"—
In his own words, says the Quarterly, “a new rerolution /* And—
“This fatal menace—fatal to the ministry if not executed—fatal to the monarchy if it
is—was thrown out, as it is said, without the sanction of the Sovereign or the concert of
his colleagues, for no better reason, and with no higher motive, than to help him through
a paltry party scrape; to rally, on a pinching vote, a few Radicals back to his standard."
Poor monarchy! Dead again! What then? When duly killed, and
lying in its blood, will it not, like Bombastes. Furioso, rise again upon its
legs, and blithely sing (for the especial comfort of the Quarterly)—
“For 'twas better far
Thus to end our sorrow;
But, if some folks please,
We'll die again to-morrow?”
As, no doubt, the English Constitution will die again and again, and
again and again, sing its own epitaph (though we may not be here to
listen to it) and its own resurrection.

A BANG WITH A RIFLE.
cº URELY, the decidedly great
hit that was made, once
§ 2)
upon a time, by WILLIAM
TELL, has been immea-
surably surpassed by M.
Jules GERARP, surnamed,
“The French Lion Killer.”
As how P Why, that is
not very easy to say, ex-
actly. . In a letter, ad-
dressed to a friend, which
has been published in the
Journal des Chasseurs, M.
GERARD thus describes, a
remarkable shot, by which,
he says, he slew a lion:—
“I did not hesitate a moment,
and fired at his mouth. The
animal fell on the spot, as if
struck by lightning. My men
ran up at the shot, and, as they
were eager to lay hands on the
lion, I fired a second time be-
tween the eyes, in order to se-
cure his lying perfectly still.”
A very needless pre-
caution, it seems: for
“The first bullet had taken the
course of the spine throughout its
entire length, passing through the
marrow, and had come out at the
tail.”
Thus, you see, there is
no doubt that M. GERARD
beatsthepatriot of Switzer-
land hollow: indeed it may
be questioned whether his
achievement with the lion
does not equal the exploit
rformed by the cele-
É. BARON MUNCHAU-
SEN on the bear. The
only doubt is whether he is to be considered as having eclipsed TELL’s marks-
manship (and rivalled that of the other hero) with the rifle or—the long bow.
“He’s Hit, I'M shaw "
SACRILEGIOUS OUTRAGE AT WINCHESTER
(To the Venerable Mr. Punch.)
“WEN. SIR,
. . “ALLow me to callyour attention to an attack on Winchester College by
the Winton Correspondent of the Hampshire Independent, who, from his complaining
that the reverend administrators of #. institution, appropriate two-thirds of its
revenues, I conclude, as a pious canon says in a similar case, is an Atheist. For:
bearing to quote his painful remarks on a subject so sacred as clerical income, I
will content myself with refuting his assertion that the object of the founder of the
establishment is not carried out. Affirming, with an audacity smacking rather of
Manchester than Winchester, that this College was founded by WILLIAM OF
WYKEHAM for the children of the inferior classes, he says:—
. "“The very distinct and plain terms of the statutes, ‘poor and indigent scholars"—pauperes et
indigentes scholares—leave no doubt on this point; and that the class now educated are not poor and
indigent scholars, but the sons of rich men, moving in a sphere far above the class for whose
benefit Wykeham's charity school was intended, nobody will, we think, be hardy enough to deny."
“Now, Wenerable Sir, I deny that by “pauperes et indigentes scholares,’ as above
quoted, are meant the sort # scholars that are the proper objects of the charity
of a charity school. If WILLIAM of WYKEHAM had intended them, he would
have called them sordidos et pannosos scholares—dirty and ragged scholars—or
something of that sort. The superior orders can be poor enough—poverty and the
sense of superiority, often go together. Many of them—some who are even members
of Parliament—possess less than nothing by several thousands, of pounds, which
they owe. Others are actually described, by the infidel revolutionists who are
agitating for financial and ecclesiastical reform, as state paupers. The children of
such parents are the only poor and indigent scholars, in the literal sense, whose
relief was contemplated by WYKEHAM. Intellectual pauperism—from which the
better ranks unhappily are not exempt—was the destitution principally alluded to
in the statutes of Winchester College. The children are pauperes and indigenſes,
wanting learning: the same words, as applied to their parents, may very possibly
signify wanting nothing else. - -
“The case standing clearly thus, Venerable Sir, what business has the disciple of
SPINoza, who questions the inscrutable ways of clergymen in the Hampshire
Independent, to complain as follows:–
“‘It is a well-known fact that no son of a tradesman is admitted into the College of Winchester.
A profession is the lowest social grade a man must hold to qualify him for obtaining a scholarship
for his son at WYREHAM's College, founded expressly for “poor and
indigent boys.' It is well known that there has been within the present
century a tradesman's son admitted, and that the ‘poor and indigent’
.. º that time on ‘the foundation, drove him by persecution from
the School.
.“What would this wicked murmurer against clerical
dispensations have? Did not the holy Bishop of WIN-
CHESTER found his college to teach, above all things, the
Christian virtues—and especially humility? Is not this
the very lesson, which it teaches even the children of
tradespeople, who do not go there, and which it taught that
upstart tradesman's son who did? Tradesmen, Venerable Sir,
are getting above their station. A vulgar liberalism derides
the good old dogma, that there is an inherent baseness in
Commerce. We even hear of the †. of Trade 1 But
the spirit of chivalry yet haunts the old walls and towers of
our Cathedral cities. There, at least, the tailor, the cheese-
monger, are regarded with the contempt due to their
meanness. There the mighty difference between the man
who sells figs, and the man who prescribes physic, is yet
recognised. There society still believes in the great gulf
that is fixed between two persons, one of whom can trace
back his pedigree three generations nearer than the other
to the first man, And from the triumph of Trade which we
have just witnessed in Hyde Park, it is refreshing to turn
to the glorification of Industry, as Industry is glorified at
Winchester College. I say, Wenerable Sir, this is refreshing
to ºmind. which is constituted like that of your humble

THE LAST DAYS OF BATTY'S HIPPODROME.
NATURE took care that MR. BATTY should finish a brilliant and suc-
cessful season with a regular splash; for the rain poured down in
torrents during the last two or three closing performances, and gave
the spirited proprietor the benefit of a few—too literal—overflows.
The Grecian youths, on their Thracian steeds, had their faces literally
poulticed with mud, kicked up by the heels of each other's horses; and
it may be said, without a pun, that on their arrival at the winning-post,
the children of Greece were ...; The fiery coursers of Barbary
might have felt their fire quenched by the pelting showers that fell
upon them; and though unfettered by bit or bridle, they were exposed
to the heaviest rains. Happily the season had been too prosperous to
be marred by the contretemps of a little bad weather at the close; and
we shall look forward to meet MR. BATTY again, in all his glory, accord:
ing to his promise, in the summer of 1852. It may be cited as a proof
of the loyalty of the company, and the good nature of the horses, that
when caſed on to perform in the wet, the former never said “No,” and
the latter never said “Neigh.”
S
Humours of the Rail.
“A BARRISTER,” complaining in the Times of the gross want of
punctuality of the London and North-Western Railway, writes thus:—
“On going into the Station, I beheld a placard, stating that the company would not
be responsible for any delay either in the starting or arrival of the trains as stated in
the books, nor for any inconvenience which might ensue. I think, Sir, you will agree
with me that this out-Herods HERod.”
Indeed it does out-Herod HERod: as is likely to be proved by a
greater slaughter than the massacre of the Innocents.
A of sullen wilfulness, presided on the Saturday, and on the
SHALL THE CRYSTAL PALACE STAND P
ARE we to take to ourselves the closing ceremonies of the Exhibition
as sad, dull presages of the doom of the wondrous fabric itself—a doom
resolved upon, and relentlessly pursued by the stern wisdom of the great
PAN of the Woods and Forests? If so, most pertinently, most admir-
ably, were those ceremonies ordered: for the very genius º:
Wednesday. Not a man ... in the lack-a-daisical pageant, not one,
from the Prince to the Bishop, but dulness marked him for her own.
Authority seemed to be remorseful of the jocund bearing held on the
1st of May; and therefore did a sort of dropjaw penance on the 15th of
October. Humdrum was paramount! And skies sympathised
with human gloom, making all as dim and comfortless without the
crystal walls, as authority was dark and glumpy within. A loyal super-
stition attributed the wet and murky weather to the absence of the
QUEEN. Had she graced the pageant, all, would have been light and
debonnaire ; HER MAJESTY, according to the cheerful faith, being a
concentration of sunbeams.
But the fact is now unalterable; and let us, as sober, melancholy
mind-the-main-chance Britons, rejoice thereupon. We have redeemed
our character—our inalienable right—of dulness. If we did let loose
somewhat in unseemly gaiety on the 1st of May; have we not recovered
ourselves in the substantial stupidity of the 15th of October 2 If we did
mum and flaunt it in the spring, to the astonishment of the stranger–
who wondered much at jocund BULL!—have we not returned to our
national sackcloth, our characteristic ashes, in autumn P Yes; we hope
we have redeemed ourselves in the doubtful opinion of the foreigner."
We have every faith that the stranger will depart from our shores with
the strengthened conviction, that when JoHN BULL in authority makes
up his mind to be freezinglycold, and substantially sullen, he may triumph-
antly compete with all the human race. There was, as the closing cere-
monial was acted, one prize medal wanting. A medal, with a whole
pig of lead in it—for the dumps. And this medal—who can doubt it?
—must have been carried off by the Royal Commission. .
And yet there may have been a kindness intended in the gloom of
the ceremony: benevolence may have lurked in the doldrums of
authority. The utter blankness of meaning with which the Exhibition
was ãºred at an end, may have been studiously, yet, withal, tenderly
affected to prepare us for the grand consummation of the most pro:
found, the most triumphant, and most barbarous stupidity (spiced
somewhat with wickedness), that ever made ape kind gape at mankind;
—to wit, the destruction of the last wonder of the world, the mar-
vellous fabric that, at a glance, has won the homage of millions.
Not that the sensibility, masked in coldness, of authority, was all
undignified by a high, patrician º a stoicism that would see
the crystal wonder break into nothing, ike a prismatic soap-bubble.
Not, moreover, that LoRD SEYMOUR is to be thought the great original
of official insensibility: oh, no-
“Ere wild in Woods that noble savage ran,"—
we had many and many high examples of the rabid contempt of office
for the wishes and sympathies of .. people. Lord SEYMoUR, able as
he is in his way, is only a large contributor, not an originator. How-
ever, when the £alace shall have passed away, we trust that among the
statues to be raised to commemorate its once whereabout, there will be
some effigy to eternize the condescension and urbanity radiant in the
head Minister of Woods and Forests for 1851. May we propose a
statue of The Snarling Faun ?
However, taking it as foolishly and wickedly determined by authority
—and no less stupidly and criminally granted and accepted by the
country—that the wondrous fabric shall be broken up, having served its
turn, like a child's money-box—how about the reward for the inventor
of the new marvel? Great was the perplexity of the Royal Commission,
blinded and smothered by visions º bricks and mortar—no more to be
got together by the appointed time than the final bricks of Babel—
when Joseph Paxton shot like a sunbeam upon the darkened council.
An outrolling of a sheet of paper—a few master words—and Joseph
PAxton became the deliverer of his Prince and his Prince's Magi from
difficulties that threatened to be inextricable—making for himself a
ºxide renown, and leaving his name, “like a wild-flower to his
and.”
Well, Joseph PAxton, at this writing, has been offered knighthood.
What beside? Knighthood may or may not be a valuable nominal
Fº : the word—the sound—takes its worth from the estimation of
its bearer... Some men may make no more account of such title than
of the jingling of pebbles in a tin-pot: others may consider it still to
vibrate with ravishing music.
But knighthood—mere knighthood! Have we not accidental knights
– knights, of good luck? Royalty goes into the City; and, lo! by
virtue of that happy incident, two aldermen blow into knights. “Wings
at our shoulders seem to play !” On a sudden, spurs jingle at our civic
heels, delighting our civic ears.
Majesty makes a progress, in pelting shower, visiting Liverpool, and

the Liverpool bolster—a knight, of newest print, is stamped upon the
cotton city. And it may be well, with our institutions, that this should
be. Where the Queen of Beauty set her foot, flowers sprang at the
touch; where Queen Victoria travels, let honours blossom. But
these are honours of ceremony—Court Circular glories—hardly of
marked account, when vouchsafed upon men whose official life is not an
accident; but whose position in the eye of mankind has been won by
the inspiration and the labour of their souls. Surely, the case of Joseph
Paxton is a case of “Genius versus Mayors and Aldermen.”
All dues paid, the Exhibition Commission are encumbered with a
uarter of a million of money. How much of this is owing to the
elicitous genius, inspired at the happiest moment, of Joseph Paxton

to the fish within it. Of the millions of visitors to the Exhibition, how
many came to the sight, brought thither hy what they had heard and
read of the wonderful Crystal Palace? That Palace, dimly shown in
ictures—darkly outlined in printers’ ink? Displace that beautiful
abric from the mind, and in its stead place the brick-and-mortar moun-
tain that was to have been—granting it could have been piled by the
1st of May—and how many tens of thousands may be deducted from
the millions of pilgrims who for the past five months have thronged our
streets wending to Hyde Park; there, at one glance, to acknowledge a
wonder of beauty that seemed to realise (the fiction of fairy-land: fa
structure raised rather by the genii of SINDBAD, than the materialised
thought of human genius?
W. the CHANCELlor of THE Exchequeſt is, in his pride of office,
a smiling debtor to Joseph Paxton. Run through the items of the
increasing revenue—as last made up—and the fiscal influence of the
Crystal Palace brightens in almost every numeral. All folks with com-
modities to sell—or sights to show—whatever was the lull for the
month of May—have reaped a ten-fold harvest. There can be no sulky
denial of this truth; the Exchequer possesses proof of it—playhouse
managers, in thankful closing speeches, confess it. But leaving all
this profit apart, come we to the hard, glittering fact of a quarter of a
million made beneath the roof of the Crystal Palace.
What, then, for the architect? . Mere knighthood? Court ginger-
bread, with no gilding? This will never do. Some small per-centage
from that quarter of a million is as much the due of Joseph Paxton as
was his day’s wage to any Joseph the glazier who worked at the
fabric. All England must grant this truth; and to the will of England
to insist upon its application, we hopefully leave it.
Finally, shall the Crystal Palace stand?
This is a question to be answered, once and for all, by the people.
A certain knot of the aristocracy, strong in their faith of official
sympathy towards all that is exclusive, all that is contemptuous
of the masses, already rejoice in the certainty of the demolition of the
five months' wonder of the world. If the people do not speak with one
loud, unstammering voice, LoRD SEYMour and his merry men will
rush to the destruction; jolly, and full-blooded as the Goths rushed
into Rome. And they will do Goths' work, to the disgrace of England,
and the scorn and the amazement of the nations; if the voice of the
country do not with one acclaim cry, “Hold!”
A FEW WORDS ON WINES.
“At this season of the year,” as the advertisements and puffing
circulars have it, we feel it a duty to give the world a little advice
upon wines, and if we cannot tell them exactly what to drink, or what
to buy, we can at least inform them what to avoid. We therefore
offer the following hints:-
1. When you see wine advertised as “an excellent wine to lay down,”
be sure it is not worth picking up.
2. When you read of a wine that is described as “full of body,” you
may conclude that it is half spirit.
3. When you hear of a wine being particularly “racy,” you may set
it down as sloe.
4. When you are asked to purchase a fine old sherry with a mutty
flavour, the motion of the nut may suggest the idea of what is commonly
termed a cracker.

In a recent Birmingham Trade Report, it was stated,
“We had a fair consumptive demand for beans at the rates of this day se’nnight.
“Peas were less inquired for.”

THE JOKE MARKET.
ost happy are we to be able to
record a better feeling in the Joke
Market this week; and we have
seen, some specimens of very fair
middlings or seconds, which are
likely to command, some attention.
The following are the latest quota.
tions in dry humour—a species of
dry goods that will always be in de-
mand, if the quality is respectable:—
“A FEE SIMPLE-The Guinea
paid to a Quack.”
“A 200 GUINEA ChalleNGE To
MR. HoBBs.--To pick one of the
Dead Locks in Fleet Street.”
The Conundrum Market has not
. yet recovered from its flatness, and,
indeed, the facility with which any stuff can be manu-
factured, will give rise to those constant gluts which
the public taste naturally revolts against. In this way
some of the most respectable manufactories are often
| || left with a large stock, of a really good quality of
|| || Conundrum on hand, with no means of getting rid of
it. The following are some of the best samples we
have lately met with:—
“Why is a very old umbrella, that has been lost, as good as new when
found?” “Because it’s re-covered.”
There is no doubt that the excessive depression in the Comundrum
trade arises partly from the ignorance of many of those who embark in
it, and who inundate the markets with worthless paper, which no
respectable house will look at. The following stuffs have been offered;
and we only give the quotations for the purpose of warning young
beginners against having anything to do with them:-
“Why is a Review like an inferior species of tobacco-pipe?” “Be-
cause it’s a meerschaum (mere sham).”
It will be seen that all the first principles of orthography, on which
every literary transaction ought to be based, are entirely disregarded
in this dishonest attempt to gain credit for an article which is really
worth nothing. We have ourselves been sometimes asked to make
advances on produce similar to this; but we have always avoided doing
business of any kind with the parties who have applied to us.

* PRINCE OF WALES.”
ITH the closing of the Exhibition, among
other regrets, we must not omit to
mention those naturally excited by the
fact, that ADMIRAL BENBow Hazy, the
Commander-in-Chief of the Serpentine
Station, has hauled down his flag. The
gallant officer retires into private life,
garrying with him” (says Hoar's Nautical
Record) “those regrets which have usually
attended his departure from the stations
on which he has served during his naval
career.” -
Without inquiring too closely into the
Editor's phrase—susceptible, according to
some people, of a double meaning—we
may be allowed to express our regard for
the gallant officer whose career has thus
come to a close. In conformity with the
Admiralty regulations—which require the
transmission of all journals, &c., kept
during a commission, to their Lordships—
the Admiral has forwarded to Whitehall a
variety of documents. We extract a
general Report of his, which alone would
suffice to prove the attention he has paid
... • to his duties, and which is curiously illus-
trative of the present state of naval affairs. Some may suspect the
Admiral of irony, occasionally; but we must protest against any unjust
interpretation of his valuable document.
“R EPO R.T.
“My LoRDs, “H.M.S. Prince of Wales, Serpentine.
“IN forwarding to you the Log of H.M.S. Prince of Wales
with my Journals, I take the opportunity of making some general ob-
servations, founded on the experience of my commission. .
- “I am glad to inform your Lordships that the Prince of Wales is
quite dºi: of sailing. When you heave up her anchor and put sail
upon her (which three of your Lordships, at least, know to be the
necessary preliminaries), she proceeds to, move º the water,
according to the usual laws of motion. When you put the helm down,
and ease away the head sheets, and so gradually “raise tacks and sheets,’
and then haul round the after-yards—‘hauling of all,” when the after
sails “fill’—she tacks according, also, to the usuallaws—known to three
of your Lordships. I have not observed that she rolls at all remarkably,
or groans, or tears herself to pieces. It may surprise your Lordships,
but such is the fact....Your Lordships are aware that you rarely have a
vessel (capable of sailing faster than a collier) which does not roll, groan,
and tear, whenever it comes on to blow. - -
“I have to thank your Lordships, for not having, caused any altera-
tion to be made in the general build of H.M.S. Prince of Hales, while
under my command. Had your Lordships made a total change in the
build of her stern two or three times, as you did to the Caledonia, it
would possibly have spoilt her, as it spoiled the Caledonia. I thank
ou for your abstinence in this matter. It is with great deference that
ask a question—but, Doyour Lordships take so much pains about the
Sterns º vessels under the idea that that is the part of them we ought
to show to foreigners?
“I was prepared,º Lords, when I found that H. M. S. Prince of
Wales was a good sailor, to hear that you were about to have her
changed into a steamer...I remembered the ſate of the Penelope (with
all her architectural suitors), and expected to have had my vessel
lengthened, in order to undergo the said sea change.” I am grateful
to yºur Lordships for your kindness in this particular. . .
“The Prince of Males was supplied with the masts and rigging intended
for her, and suited to her size, and not with those of any other of Her
Majesty's ships of war. The experiment has answered admirably; and
I cordially recommend the custom to your Lordships in future.
“I have occasionally found a discrepancy between the depth of water
in the Serpentine sea as established by Nature, and the depth of water
laid down in the Admiralty charts. As duty prompted, I have generally
given the preference to the latter authority. But I would (with per-
mission) suggest to your, Lordships that these authorities should be
occasionally compared and harmonised. - -
“Such, my Lords, are the nautical observations which I have to
submit to you. - -
“With regard to my public duties, as Commander of a British force, I
leave them to your Lordships' kind consideration. My conduct in the
difficult matter of the enforcement of the compensation of the bo
Snogg, for the seizure of his punt by the Humane Society, was,
trust, worthy of a British Admiral. SNOGG was compensated. Enough,

We may possibly glance at others of the late Commander-in-Chief’s
documents at a future period.
PUNCH'S NOTES AND QUERIES.
Cock Robin.-“CAN any of your correspondents tell me,” asks
SCALIGER, junior, “who killed Cock Robin?” . An under-graduate,
writing from St. Bees, asks, “whether Cock Robin can be the same
as RoPIN. Hood?” An antiquarian friend suggests that the Sparrow,
with his bow and arrow, belonged to the old family of the SPARRows
who used to occupy a house over the archway on the Archery ground
which has been since pulled down.
The Horner Family.—We have been unable to trace the HoRNER family
further than the corner into which we were driven when looking after
little JACK HoRNER, the eater of the Christmas pie. Pies were not
always eaten at Christmas; but a correspondent, dating from Buenos
A ...hº..." Margate, suggests that a Mag-pie may have been the pie
uſed UO.
Enough's as good as a feast–We agree with our correspondent,
CLERICUs, that “enough” may be a corruption of unawf-meaning that
an egg is as good as a feast. The Saxons were the first who, from an
excess of piety, taught their grandmothers to suck eggs.
A TEA-TOTALLER'S WISH.
MINE be a cot beside a rill,
Where I can always drink my fill,"
And underneath an osier's clump
Give me a good old-fashioned pump."
Let me a pleasant brook command,"
Where I could drink out of my hand,
Qr ask—for lack of other mug—
The nightingale to lend his jug. 3
A stream should run from north to south,
O'er which I’d hold my watering mouth;
And if on more I fain would glut,
Give me a good-sized water-butt.
Let others sing the joys of wine—
The cistern's wholesome draught be mine;
I only need a small estate,
Enough to pay my water-rate.
Let me * idly o'er the marge
Of some full-laden river-barge;
My face in water let me dip,
To catch the fluid on my lip.
Wealth has for me nor charm nor bribe,
While water I can still imbibe;
Let poets other seasons sing,
But give me a perpetual spring.
Fashionable Departures.
THE tide of emigration has fairly set in, or, rather, has set out, from
the Crystal Palace. Half Austria has been crowded into vans of every
description; a portion of Russia has left in cabs; fragments of the
Zollverein have been carried off on trucks; and we have seen bits of
France on the top of an omnibus; the Greek Slave was driven off in a
#: and Cain and his Family took their departure in a very
broad wheeled wagon.
Not a Bad Dodge.
By a curious coincidence, the name of one of the United States
Commissioners at the Exhibition of Industry was MR. DoDGE. The
Americans could not have selected a better representative, as far as
name is concerned, for they have shown us a great many clever
Dodges that were quite unknown to us before, and we dare say the
Commissioner is the cleverest DoDGE of the whole.

PRUDENCE AND MESMERISM AT HUNGERFORD I
HALL.
“MR. PUNCH,
“I went, the other evening, to º Hall, Strand, to
see an exhibition of animal magnetism by M. LAssaignE and MLLE.
| PRUDENCE, whom M. Lassaigne, by setting her to sleep, causes to
| do things that make her appear extremely wide awake.
| “Miss PRUDENCE was soon made to slumber by the usual passes,
which, though not at all extraordinary in themselves, are, in their
effects—if they produce any—passing strange.
“The first feat Miss PRUDENCE was to perform was that of causing an
actual magnet to move without touching it, . She had been divested of
her rings, and other ornaments, which might, have been steel or iron
under a mask of gilt., I had satisfied myself that the magnet was a
bond fide magnet, by applying my latch-key thereunto. Miss PRUDENCE—
before being magnetised—had* arently tried to make it move without
effect. She passed her forehead backwards and forwards a few inches
from it; and the magnet no more stirred than if her head had been a
blockhead, instead of the knowledge-box of at least a very sharp young
lady.
*After she had been magnetised, on repeating the movement of her
forehead near the magnet, the latter certainly did unmistakeably
oscillate. I was convinced that Miss PRUDENCE had imparted motion
to the magnet. But I remarked that I was not sure whether Miss
PRUDENCE did this by magnetic influence or by communicating
vibration through, the floor. Hereupon the ..º.º. and stage-
manager of the exhibition, had the magnet removed to another place,
for the satisfaction of ‘the sceptical gentleman,” as he termed me.
But I was by no means clear that the magnet, by this move, was put
out of the sphere of vibration. It moved precisely as before, although
it was contained in a glass case, and could not have been blown
upon. But to have been enabled to form a conclusion on the subject,
should have required the magnet to be suspended in, its case,
instead of being set on a stand; and I should have wished Miss
PRUDENCE to place her head leisurely on one side of the magnet, and
on the other—without bustle and hurry. Unluckily, the power, I was
told, was evanescent, and haste necessary. , So the magnet moved; but
my mind, Mr. Punch, remained in º equilibrium.
“A display of thought-reading followed. MR. LassaignE, standing
ten or twelve paces behind MIss PRUDENCE, imparted—seemingly by
his mere will—to that young lady communications whispered in his ear
by any one who chose to come forward. He sent her with a bouquet
to whomsoever he was required to send her among the spectators. He
made her talk and gesticulate as if she were walking over briars, roses,
or what not—the ordeal might have been that of red-hot ploughshares,
if Mr. Punch had chosen. But I tried a different experiment. The
process by which the last-named wonder was worked, consisted, partly,
in the suggester of the idea to be impressed grasping the hand of the
somnambulist, and willing the same thing as the operator. I simply
asked MR. lass AIGNE to make her believe that she was treading on a
serpent. In the mean time, I took her hand, and willed, with all
might, that she should fancy herself walking on heather. She walke
on the imaginary serpent, but not on the heather. My will had
no effect on her whatever, that I could see. Therefore, Fº of the
process was unnecessary—then, why resorted to ?... And therefore,
though I was convinced that an idea was imparted by MR, LAssaignE to
Miss PRUDENCE, somehow, I could no more draw an inference as to
how it was done, than I could draw a luggage-train.
“Miss PRUDENCE related, very dramatically, short stories which
were whispered to MR. LassaignE, to the satisfaction, in every
instance, of those who tested her, and who certainly neither, ap-
º to be rogues nor fools. Collusion or trick_seemed impossible:
ut here, again, I wanted to analyze; and if I am to believe an
apparent miracle, merely because I cannot imagine how it is done, I

may as well be called upon to acknowledge that a plum-pudding can be
boiled in a hat. Such an operation is not more incomprehensible than
g_a series of ideas into the head of a person asleep a dozen
paces on.
“Similarly, at the mental command of MR. LassaignE, Miss PRU-
DENCE enacted various attitudes, after divers statues and pictures.
Anybody, might suggest such as he chose. I proposed JIM CRow:
This I did, not out of buffoonery (which I despise), but because I
thought JIM CRow's an unlikely figure to have been preconcerted.
The interpreter, with a bland smile, told me that JIM CRow was
“impossible—a caricature.”
“So I came away little wiser than I went; for I knew beforehand
that mesmerists show extraordinary phenomena, to which they seldom
let you apply the rather necessary process of analysis. They call, in
reference to their most astounding prodigies, the common caution with
which a chemist—or any other philosopher—verifies the least remarkable
fact, scepticism. Nobody else talks thus, except friars and quacks. As
ong as mesmerists continue to resemble them, I am afraid that their
wonders, however authentic, will obtain no more credit amongst
reasoning men, than the relics of the one, or the panaceas of the other.

THE LAW OF DOMESTIC STORMS.
WHTLst scientific men are very laudably devoting themselves to the
study of storms in general, we propose investigating that particular
branch of the subject which is applicable to every-day #!" for a know-
ledge of the theory and causes of domestic storms must be useful to all
classes of the community. -
It was on contemplating the ruin caused by a domestic hurricane, in
the midst of China, that the writer first conceived the idea of giving
his head to a subject about which his head had been broken more than
once, though he had never before thought of collecting together the
results of his experience.
He had observed that the various domestic storms he had encoun-
tered, as mate of a very troublesome craft, though sometimes sudden
and furious, had generally some determined cause, and frequently took
the same direction, by concentrating towards himself all their violence.
He resolved, therefore, on keeping a log, or journal, in which he
noted down, from hour to hour, the state of the craft to which he acted
as mate—with the nominal rank of commander. He described her
condition under a slight breeze, her behaviour in rough weather, the
effect produced upon her by all sorts of airs; and, in fact, he collected
such information, that he thought any judicious mate, attached to a
similar craft, would find little difficulty in her management.
One of the curiosities of this domestic experience, is the fact, that the
same hurricanes prevail at about the same periods of the year; and it
is remarkable, that though the wind seems to be raised with immense
difficulty about Christmas time, domestic storms are most prevalent
at that period.
These storms are not felt to º: so severely on those who are
provided with a heavy balance, which prevents the agitating influence
of those fearful ups and downs which are met with at the time
alluded to. -
Those who are protected by the shelter of a bank are comparatively
safe in these storms; though the less substantial, craft, unable to meet
an unusually heavy draft, will frequently be found incapable of keeping
the head above water. - -
It is a singular fact, that domestic, like other storms, prevail in
circles; and, indeed, there is no circle in which they are not to be
found; for they visit the family circle, the higher circles, and the lower
circles, with almost equal º - - -
A thorough understanding of the domestic hurricane is of course
invaluable to a master having the charge of one of the weaker vessels,
for it enables him to perceive the storm coming on, and to Fº out of
it. A domestic storm is generally preceded by a great deal of puffing
and blowing, which leads more or less gradually to a regular blow up;
and the craft will frequently begin to heave, in every direction. Some
masters endeavour to meet the storm by heaving to; but this often
doubles, without subduing, its violence. The damage done during a
domestic storm of this mature is always very great, and a family
wreck is not unfrequently the sad consequence. -
The numerous different airs that prevail, and form, as it were, the
elements of a domestic storm, would form a long and lament-
able chapter of themselves; but we give the heads of a few of the
principal. Sometimes a storm begins with trifling airs, but these often
increase suddenly to a squall of the most alarmin character. Some-
times a storm commences with vapours, which by degrees dissolve into
moisture, and a squall springs up, accompanied by torrents of tears
rushing down the face ºf nature, or ill-mature, with fearful fury. A
storm of this kind passes over more quickly than some of the other
sorts, though the craft often goes right over on her beam-ends; and,
under these circumstances, if allowed to lay-to for a time, she will
most probabl right of herself, without the mate or master taking any
trouble. If he is timid, he will probably begin to try and bring the
craft round, by taking her out of stays, cutting away her rigging, or
some other desperate process; but the best way is to leave her alone,
though it is sometimes justifiable to dipherjib well into the water, for
the purpose of keeping her steady. If the domestic storm threatens
to be disagreeably durable, and the squall continues, it may be advisable
to lower the gaff, by reefing the throat-rope or cap-string under the
jaws, and make all taut and quiet. This process is fermed, in nautical
º bending a spanker; and there is no doubt that the most
ormidable spanker may be bent by a firm adoption of the plan
suggested. If she labours much, you can ease the throat-rope, so as to
give room for everything to work fairly aloft; but if you see a squall
getting up, clew her down immediately.

NEW EMANCIPATION OF THE BLACKS.
WE are º to observe that there has lately been a new Emancipation movement,
which has ended in freeing those unhappy objects, the Ethiopian Serenaders, from the
fetters of soot and butter which for some time they have laboured under. Formerly our
streets swarmed with these miserable slaves to circumstances, and there was scarcely a
concert-room or a thoroughfare which had not a party of those Ethiopian Serenaders,
who, by blackening their own faces, may be said to have caused a stain on humanity.
The advance of civilisation—in public taste—has released thousands of these poor creatures
from their former degradation, and they can now appear in our streets with comparatively
clean faces, if not with clean hands. It used to be the boast of England, that the
negro no sooner put his foot on these shores than the difference in colour was virtually
obliterated; but it must now be our pride to think that the Ethiopian Serenader no
sooner puts his head under the British pump than he wears the complexion of freedom,
and washes out the black trace of degrading slavery.
What Language do they Speak in California?
THERE is a lottery at the present moment in France (tickets 1 franc 25 centimes each),
which is called La Loterie des Lingots D'Or. It is established for the purpose of sending
emigrants over to California; and of all places we should think California would be the
very ºl. where the Lingot D'Or would be of the greatest benefit; for we do not know
what language may be exactly spoken there, but we can imagine that the Lingo in most
people's mouths in California would certainly be the Lingo D’Or."

SERMONS IN (BRIGHTON). STONES.
ONE of the female and puerile amusements of Brighton is the picking
up of pebbles on the beach, and cheating oneself, or being cheated by
local lapidaries, into the belief that the stones are, to a certain extent,
precious, and that they are worth the expense of polishing.
A lady, or a child, turns up a round pebble, and runs with it to the
lapidary, who proclaims it to be a fine emerald, and sends home in the
course of the day a piece of green glass similar in size to the stone that
had been left with him. Superstition seems to have as many heads as the
Hydra; for, though there has long since been an end to the old notion
that London, is paved with gold, the kindred idea that the Brighton
shore is paved with precious stones seems to be still prevalent. As the
Brighton season is now on, we may intimate, to the female collectors
that, as all “that glitters is not gold,” so all that the lapidaries are
prepared to cut, polish, and charge for, are not jewels.
THE SKY-BLUE SONG.
&uggested by ALFRED TENNYson's Bugle Song in “The Princess."
THE Milkman calls at the outer walls,
And many a maid from upper story
Comes down the stairs in the dress she wears,
In all her afternoon-tide glory. -
* Qh, milk below !” sets the wild echoes flying,
“Oh, milk below !” crying, crying, crying.
Ah me, oh dear, how thin and clear,
Thinner and clearer daily growing !
I almost deem that I hear the stream
Of water into the milk-can flowing.
* Qh, milk below!” I’m surely never buying,
“Oh, milk below !” lying, lying, lying !
Oh, that is the hue of the pale sky-blue,
That’s made from cistern, pump, or river;
No cow in a field such stuff would yield,
The sight of it makes me shiver, shiver.
“Oh, milk below!” thus I send it flying—
Go, Milkman, go! lying, lying, lying ! .
ROSSUTH AT SOUTHAMPTON.
(By our own Reporter.)
YoUR own reporter ought to be at least one of a thousand. Your
humble servant is one of two or three thousand, who in genteel language
may perhaps be called a mob, that followed KossuTH up the High Street
of Southampton.
When I say I followed Kossuth, I mean I followed Kossuth's
carriage. When I say I followed KossuTH's carriage, I mean I followed
the MAYOR OF SouthAMPTON's carriage, which contained the Mayor,
several other gentlemen, and Kossuth. And when I say I followed
the MAYok of SouTHAMPTON's carriage, I mean I followed the last of
three post-chaises which followed in the wake of the Mayor's carriage,
if the carriage of his Worship the Mayor, or any other carriage, can be
said to have a wake.
Followed only by the post-chaises and the people, Kossuth may be
said to have cut rather a mean and shabby figure in his progress up the
High Street. No splendid line of vehicles, driven by liveried coach-
men, filled with rank and beauty, and adorned with scutcheons, formed
his train. Their place was supplied simply by an enthusiastic multi-
tude, whose vociferous cheers, and the waving of handkerchiefs
...hº...” window, constituted the only welcome of the Hungarian
chleitain.
A considerable number of persons assembled to witness the present-
ation of the banner, and the addresses to KossuTH, in the Town Hall.
But it is a mistake to suppose that, these comprised the entire popula-
tion of Southampton and the neighbourhood, as many as two or three
retired Admirals and half-pay officers stood aloof from the proceedings,
and denounced them with imprecations. -
In acknowledgment of the honours paid him by the corporation and
the inhabitants, Kossuth made a speech, which candour compels me
to admit, was decidedly eloquent, and replete with feeling that may
be described as noble and generous; but his warmest admirers must
confess that it was disfigured by a slightly foreign accent. It is true
that he did not express any Red Republican, Socialist, ºr Communist
sentiments, nor ; he violently abuse even his enemies; but he elicited
a strong expression of disgust and detestation against the EMPEROR
of Austria, the more remarkable because it was accompanied by
manifestations of the most fervent loyalty towards the QUEEN of
GREAT BRITAIN | -
I cannot conscientiously say that, Kossuth looks like a humbug: in-
deed, his countenance and bearing impress me with an idea that he is a
fine, noble fellow ; but you know that appearances are fallacious. Nor
has he, as yet, done anything ridiculous; but a foreigner, who appears
to be connected with him, is going about here in a beard, and a frock
braided with red, looking like a fireman waterman. This man is un ues-
tionably melodramatic; and KossuTH himself could not deny that he is
a supernumerary.
In spite of the alleged popularity of the Magyar leader, I can assure
you that I have heard no less than two respectable persons condemn
him as a rebel, and I am credibly informed that one young gentleman
has pronounced that he ought to be hanged. -
†. Kossuth banquet will have taken place before you can print
this. It will be an awful waste, both of sympathy and victuals;
for his Worship, the Mayor, under whose auspices, it is, got up, is
notorious for going the entire animal, not only in liberalism, but in
liberality.

Woman has hitherto been dr ged to the earth—such
is the avowal of the American Bloomer Priestess, from
Miss KELLY's Tripod, Dean Street, Soho-pulled
towards the very centre by the weight of her petticoats;
but she now throws them to the winds, and is straight-
way free and buxom as DIANA. oman-says the
Sibyl Bloomer—makes the best ruler; witness, ELIZA-
Beth, ANNE, Victoria. Even so; but then, they did
not rule in small-clothes. We are bound to look at
both sides of the question. If a Queen regnant take to
pantaloons, may she not, with male attire, assume
masculine weakness? ...But the answer of the Bloomer
is ready and confounding—“Tyrant, the women were
great and good despite of their petticoats.”
The Soho Bloomer declares that the original fault of
Eve, that for a time made her the serf of her husband,
has been pardoned; and to start from the present, that
“she was equal to man; and as she had never con-
sented to the several laws enacted in her behalf, she
ought not, in justice, to be bound by them.” This may
be true; but, unhappily, the like argument applies to
millions of men, privileged in all the rights of tailorship,
Nevertheless, we are still reminded of the great moral
questions involved in the Bloomer leggings. ...With
trousers comes social and political freedom. Forego
the cumbrous, degrading petticoat, and the woman is
emancipated—equal with her sometime lord.
“The Mountain Nymph, sweet Liberty,”
at one bound, asserts herself by going into small-clothes!

A DIRTY FINGER IN THE PIE.
THE story goes that once upon, a time a small, impudent chimney;
sweeper entered a pastrycook's shop, and laying his sooty finger amid
the jam of a raspberry-fart, inquired knowingly—"What do you ax for
this spiled tart?” §. FEARGus Q'Connor, like the chimney-sweeper,
would spoil almost every political and social pie he thrusts his finger
into. e has put his finger in the Kossuth pie, and if not with
damaging effect, it is not his fault. He attended the Hanover Rooms
meeting, and in allusion to that “infernal old ruffian, HAYNAU,'...benevo:
lently remarked that BARCLAY AND PERKINs draymen...really ought
to have put him into a brewing vat, and boiled him.” Boiling HAYNAU,
and welcoming KossuTH, have, of course, one and the same social in-
ference. When we consider what the brewers' men merely did, with
what FEARGus O'Connor would not have left undone,—how much
exalted are the draymen above the chimney-sweeper!

portraits and biographies of ſº. connected with the Exhibition,
whose families and friends will naturally provide themselves with copies
of their relatives’ lives and countenances, Mr. Punch, ever anxious
to benefit self and public, has it in contemplation to ornament his
journal with
LIVES AND PORTRAITS OF THE EXHIBITORS
Who have not gained Prizes at the Exposition of 1851.
And to this highly interesting class he strongly recommends his publi-
cation, of which if but six º weekly be taken by every Exhibitor,
a decent remuneration cannot fail to attend the labours of MR. P.
As specimens taken at hazard merely, Mr. Punch offers for the
present week, pictures and biographies of auf tº
SAMUEL PodgeRs, Esq., Exhibitor IN THE AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT:
An IMPRoved Spud, NoT IN THE LEAST Noticed BY THE CoMMITTEE.
MR. PODGERs is the eldest son, though the third child, of MAJOR
PoDGERs, of the Horse Marines, which fie commanded on the death of
their Colonel, in the flotilla action in the Bay of Fundy. The Major
married BELLA, seventh daughter of SIR MUFFTON, WROGGLEs, of
Wrogglesby, Northamptonshire, in which county the old Saxon family of
WRoggles, or WoRogies, has been located, since the days of ALFRED.
The PodgeRs º though ancient, is not of such antiquity. MR.
Podgers received his elementary education under the care of the
REVEREND DR. GRIG, at Northampton, whence he was removed to
Harrow-on-the-Hill, where he would have been a contemporary of
were studying there. It does not appear that MASTER Popg|ERs took
any prizes at Harrow, any more than at the Exhibition of 1851; his
enius, though useful, not being brilliant, and his powers of application
É. only trifling.
MR. PoDGERs was removed from Harrow to Coppermose. º:
Oxford, in the year 18–, and here, though not distinguished for
classical attainments, he was very near gaining the prize of valour in a
single combat with a gigantic bargeman at Iffley Lock; but the mariner
proved the better man, and an injury to M.R. PodgeRs's nose was the
only permanent consequence of the remcontre.
It was not till 1823 that he inherited, by the demise of the gallant
Major, his father, his estate of Hodgers-Podgers, Hants, where he now
resides, occupying himself with agricultural pursuits, and with hunting,
although increasing years and weight have rather wearied him of that
occupation. MR. Popg|ERs is a magistrate and a married man; the
father (by EMILY, daughter of the REVEREND FELIX RABBITs) of
thirteen children.
His spud was invented towards the close of the year 1850, and it is
unnecessary to particularise this invention, which has not been found to
answer better than, or indeed to differ greatly from, implements of a
like simple nature.
MR. Popg|ERs's opinions as a politician are well known. Not noisy
he is consistent; and has often been heard to say, that if all Englan
were like him, we should get Protection back again. England being of
the contrary opinion, no such result is expected. He is three score
years old, and weighs, we should think, a good fourteen stone ten.
MRS, FREDERICA GLINDERs, Author of A CountERPANE.
MRs. GLINDERs retained, by marrying her cousin, her own maiden
and respectable name. , MR. GLINDERs, her father, has long been
known as a distinguished medical practitioner at Bath. MR. FitzRoy
GLINDERs, her husband, is a solicitor in that city.
In Bath, or its charming neighbourhood, the chief part of the exist-
ence of MRs. GLINDERs has been passed. It was here that she con-
tracted, in the year 1836, that matrimonial engagement with the
REVEREND MR. FIDDLEBURY, which was so scandalously broken off by
the Reverend Gentleman, who married Miss BLUFF. #. jury of an
offended country awarded Miss GLINDERs £500 for the damage thus
done to her affections, which sum she brought as dowry to her cousin, the
(then) young FitzRoy GLINDERs, who conducted her case. Their union
has been blessed with a considerable family: and indeed MR. GLINDERs's
... Is * full of them, that he has been obliged to take another pew
at church.
The washerwoman of Bath has ever had a constant friend in MRs.
GLINDERs. The thoughtless chimney-sweep, the ignorant º:
man of her own city have always been plentifully supplied by her with
means for º: spiritual condition. The 8. and Man-
dingoes have found her eager in their behalf.
..The counterpane sent for previous exhibition to the national Expo-
sition is intended finally as a present for the King, of Quacco. It is
woollen, striped blue and pink, with a rich fringe of yellow and pea-green.
It occupied MRs. GLINDERs two hundred and seventy-four evenings,
and the prime cost of the wool was £17.14s. 6d. For a web which was
to pass under the eyes of her own Sovereign, over the feet of another,
though a benighted, monarch, MRs. GLINDERs thought justly that
expense was not to be regarded. She had fits on not finding her name
in the prize list, and had even entertained an idea that MR. GLINDERs
DR. PARR, SIR WILLIAM Jones, LoRD BYRON, and SIR ROBERT PEEL,
had he been placed at this famous school while those eminent individuals
would receive a public honour. But time and her own ..". spirit will
console MRs. GLINDERS under these disappointments: and for the sake

PROFEssoR SLAMCoe —“A KALONATURAE,” or “SLAMcoe's GENT's
own HEAD of HAIR.”
HoRATIONELsoN SLAMCOE was born in the New Cut, Lambeth, in
the year when England lost her greatest naval hero. His mother having
witnessed the funeral procession of Trafalgar’s conqueror, determined
to bestow on her child, if a º the glorious names of the departed;
hence, in due time, the two Christian names of the subject of this
memoir. The parents of MR, SLAMCOE were in humble life; and for
the eminence which he has subsequently acquired, he has to thank his
genius rather than his education, which was neglected for the labours
necessary to one whose own hands must work his own livelihood.
HoRATIo SLAM.coe toiled. Early taken under the roof of a tonsorial
practitioner in the Waterloo Road, MR. SLAMCOE learned the rudiments
of a trade which by him has been elevated to an art; for if to imitate
beautiful Nature be Art, what man deserves the proudname of artist better
than the elegant perruquier? At twenty-one years of age, MR. SLAMCOE
had the honour of attending at L-mb–th Palace, with a wig made by
his young hands, and offered to a late reverend Prelate of our Church.
PROFEssoR. S. augured ill for Episcopacy when those ornaments of our
dignified divines fell into desuetude.
As NAPOLEoN crowned himself King and Emperor, so it was, we
believe, that HoRATIo SLAMCOE, dubbed himself frofessor. "His
inventions are known to the world, and their beneficent influence is
exemplified in his own person. Before he ever attempted continental
traveſ, his “Balsam of Bohemia” was discovered ; just as America was
discovered by Columbus before that philosophic Genoese put foot on
shipboard. His Tuscan Dentifrige ; his Carthaginian, Hair-dye; his
Fountain of Hebe, are world-celebrated cosmetics, without which ſhe
says) no toilet is complete. They are to be procured at his establish-
ment, “The College of Beauty,” with the usual liberal allowance to the
trade, who should beware of unprincipled imitators, only too eager to
adopt the discoveries of the Professor.
That the Kalomaturae, or Gent’s own Head of Hair, should have been
unrewarded by a Medal, is one of those instances which cries shame on
the awards of the Committee. Let us hope it was not a conspiracy on
the part of rival wig-makers (enemies of MR. SLAMC9E through life),
º defeated the object of his ambition. . But, if there be any
individuals blighted like himself, whose hair turned white in a single
might, as some men's have through disappointment, the Professor re-
commends to such his Carthaginian dye, which will prevent the world,
at least, from guessing what ravages grief has caused, and manly pride
would hide; though it will scarcely be credited, the Professor's own
hair is indebted for its rich jelly colour solely to the Carthaginian
discovery.
Well and skilfully, through five-and-thirty years, have the hands of

MR. BuLL looked into the fire—looked down upon the hearth-rug—

“Nonsense,” cried MRs. BULL;, and, then she added, “Yet it is
strange, and i can’t make it out that things don’t go as they did. I
can’t think what it is.”

“JoHN, my dear, you’re enough to aggravate a saint. It’s neither
rats, nor mice, nor cockroaches, nor nothing of the sort; still, for all
that, if it was the last word I had to speak, I know there's something

BULL was a little touched by the earnestness of his wife, for the
tears were coming into her eyes. Therefore John rose from his seat,
opened the cupboard door, and though MRs. BULL saw nothing, BULL
himself beheld, in his mind's eye, neither rat—nor mouse—nor cock-

“YOUR WERY HUMBLE SERVANT.”
THE emigration from Ireland is beginning to show its effects in a
demand for servants from other countries; but the demand will be
greater than the supply if the vacancies are as thoroughly vacant of all
advantages as the following. The annexed advertisement certainly shows
that there is an “opening” for an industrious man; but it is an opening
which is only calculated to let in an unfortunate occupant. The extract
is from the “Ayr Observer,” and one would imagine that the servants
in Ayr are expected to live on the local atmosphere.
A SCOTCH BUTLER FOR IRELAND.
W ANTED A BUTLER, or General Inside Servant, who is strictly honest,
sober, and orderly in his habits. He would have the assistance of a Boy to
clean shoes, and bring water, &c., &c. He should be a good attendant at table, and
understand the care of furniture, and keep himself neat in his person.
The terms given are £20 per annum, with a suit of plain clothes; to pay for his own
washing; and there is neither beer nor tea given to any of the servants.
Apply to MR. J. —, Ayr, or MR. A. J. —, Parsonstown, Ireland.
We do not exactly understand the meaning of the term “inside.”
servant, unless it is intended that the butler should act also as cook,
and thus promote all the “inside” arrangements of the family. He
must be sober, and, indeed, he can hardly be otherwise, seeing that there
is “neither beer nor tea given to any of the servants.” He is to have
“a suit of plain clothes, to pay for his own washing,” from which it
would seem that he is to be continually pawning his coat to meet his
washing bill. This is an Irish mode of discharging a liability, which
may answer, once or twice; but if this practice were general, a suit of
clothes would at length get so º mortgaged, that it would be
necessary to extend the operation of the Encumbered Estates Act to
the coats, waistcoats, and trousers of the Butlers of Ireland.

THE EX-UNPROTECTED FEMALE, UNDER THE UNITED INFLUENCE OF A STRONG-MINDED
FRIEND, AND THE INSULTS OF MR. JONES, DISPLAYS SYMPTOMS OF BLOOMERISM.
SCENE.-The Back Parlour in Great Coram Street. Time–October, 1851.
The Ex-UNPROTECTED FEMALE discovered in téte-à-tête with Miss
RUNT, a most superior and very strong-minded woman, settling into
the forties, and owning to thirty-sir, with a long nose, a loud voice, a
large foot, and a general boniness of build, full º enthusiasm for
“isms,” and of scorn for conventionalities.
Miss Runt (rising). And now, my dear MRs. Jones, I must really be
golng.
The Er-Unprotected. Oh, don’t say so, Miss RUNT | Jon Es will be in
to tea directly; and he is always so glad to see you. You know he
does so admire your conversation. He says you talk just like a man-
I think it is—or like a book. I’m not quite sure. Now, do sit down
another five minutes. - - * - * - -
Miss Runt (with modest self-consciousness, and sitting down again)... I
never could see, my dear MRs. Jones, why woman should not talk like
Inan.
The Er-Unprotected. So I’ve often said to Jones, when he will have
the last ºf
Miss Runt. Or why woman should submit to man, in general, as she
does.
The Er-Unprotected. So I always say to MR. J., when he will have
his own way. -
Miss Runt (proudly). I have made a point of never submitting to the
other sex, . Jones.
The Er-Unprotected (with a dim sense that this may not be altogether
attributable to Miss RUNT). Well, my dear, I didn't for a long time;
but there's no knowing what may come.
Miss Runt (with virgin dignity). MRs. Jon Es, I beg you will not con-
ceive the possibility of my changing my condition.
The Er-Unprotected. Oh no! my dear; I don’t think it’s the least
likely.
iń. Runt. The position of woman is deplorable—in this country, I
should say—for I understand it’s very different in America.
The Er:Unprotected (clasping her hands), Qh! I'm told it’s dreadful
there, with the bowie-knives, and Greek Slaves, and picklocks, and
things. Don't talk to me of America, there's a dear!
Miss Runt (recalling the Ex-UNPROTECTED to the point). I spoke of
woman in that country. I’m told, they have institutions there, and
female gymnastics, and public meetings, at which women address the
audience; and what is the consequence P. A woman may travel by
herself from one end of the United States to the other, and have the
best places in the coaches, and the best cabins in the steamboats, and
the best of everything, in fact. :
The Er-Unprotected (pertinaciously recurring to her prejudices). But
I’m told they, spit dreadfully all over, wherever they are; and carry
bowie-knives and pistols in their pockets, with ever so many blades—
I mean the bowie-knives, you know—
Miss Runt (with condescension). You are speaking of the men, my
dear MRs. Jones. The men in America, I presume, are like the men
everywhere else, egotistical, vain, ignorant, and presumptuous.

Miss Runt (drawing breath). However, there’s some hope of an im-
provement in that, MRs. Jon Es?
The Er-Unprotected. Eh?
Miss Runt. Yes, thanks to those very superior women—MRs.
BLoomER in America, and MRs. DExTER, here.

mean to say, my dear—

occasionally, and is familiar with the general character of her figure).

The Er-Unprotected (feeling that if Miss R. does not see the why not,
there can be no hope of making it apparent). Oh, my dear! I don’t see
any reason, if you don't—I’m sure—oh, no-
Miss Runt. I see every reason for it, on the contrary, Ma'am. You
wear stays, MRs. Jon Es? .*
The Er-Unprotected. Certainly.

Jones! that’s your diaphragma.
The Er-Unprotected (in horror). You don't say so!
Miss Runt. And those are your lungs, which you see are all squeezed
up; and that’s your heart, which you see can't play up and down as
it ought; and that’s the liver—and there’s the ribs—(the Ex:
UNPROTECTED is overwhelmed with alarm)—and that’s what we should
be like if we didn't wear stays. [ºnting to the “Wenus de Medicis.”
The Er-Unprotected (rather ifted). Well; but she wears no stays

Miss Runt. Then there’s the length of our dresses. They sweep the
streets when it’s dirty.
The Er-Unprotected. That’s true.
Miss Runt (with redoubled energy). And they'don't keep us warm,
when it’s cold; and they blow over our heads when it’s windy.
The Er-Unprotected (interjectionally). Oh! on the bridges it's dreadful.
Miss Runt (rising with her theme). And they get draggled when it’s
wet, and they trip us up when we walk, and they entangle us when we
run, and we can't get over a stile with them, and we’re forced to hold
them up at a crossing, and to put trousers on when we ride; an

The Er-Unprotected (taken aback by the interrogation). Oh, I’m sure
I don't know, my dear, unless it is that they hide one's feet, when one
hasn’t pretty ones. -
Miss Runt. You ought to be ashamed of such vanity, MRs. Jones.
No; Bloomerism is a great fact, MRs. Jon Es—and it must, and will,
triumph! Look here, MRs. Jones (producing a f. of the Bloomer
Costume). I’m sure it’s very becoming to a tail and commanding figure
(unconsciously drawing herself up). And we may wear the prettiest
things; and only six yards to the dress, instead of twelve.

Miss Runt's argument). Well, it really is rather pretty; but I’m afraid

and the bigotry, for the prejudice and intolerance of the male sex, MR.
Jones; it’s what women must expect from you whenever they try
to raise themselves in the social scale.
Jones (testily). Then, why the deuce, as we’re so bigoted, and pre-
judiced, and intolerant, and all that, will you strong-minded women
insist on making yourselves like us? Eh! Miss RUNt?—(Miss RUNT
tries to find a smart repartee, but can’t, so boils silently, while Jon Es
continues.)—And as for Bloomerism, I don't mean MARTHA to wear the
breeches, Miss RUNT, yet awhile, I can tell her.
The Er-Unprotected (statelily). MR. Jon Es! there’s no occasion to
be coarse, as well as rude, at all events.
Jones. Coarse—rude—my dear?
The Er-Unprotected (bitterly). I understand your allusion, Sir, and so
does Miss RUNT, I’ve no doubt—(in a spirit of sudden revolt). But

them a fair wind and bon
voyage to Walparaiso?
A CURE FOR BAD LEGS.
Bloomerism.
A CHEMICAL PREVENTIVE FORCE WANTED.
EENLY alive to the
welfare of our coun-
try, we are sorry to
hear that the moral
health of the metro-
polis, and, indeed,
of the nation in
gene has sadly
declined during the
last fortnight. We
understand that the
ºn Lancet's exposures
*A of the horrid adul-
| terations of tea
have been followed
by an extensive re-
linquishment of the
Chinese infusion
for the more excit-
- - - - ing beverage of
Cognac and other kindred spirits. A great diminution has taken place
in the totality of teetotalism, and a large increase in the amount of
five shilling fines: not to mention other shocking results consequent
on an immense number of the disciples of FATHER MATHEw having
gone over to BAcchus.
Perhaps the Government may not exactly deserve to be impeached
for having permitted this state of things; but they might have foreseen
and provided against it., Still, better late than never; but it will soon
be too late: and not only that, but if they do not mind what they are
about, they will have every man, woman, and child in the kingdom
abstaining from all exciseable articles that are capable of adulteration—
to the fearful detriment of the revenue.
M. is our tea black-leaded? Why is 'our morning and evening
draught#. with catechu; coloured with turmeric and Prussian
blue P hy are we condemned to moisten our own with infusion of
China clay? Why must the sweepings of silkworms' cages mingle in
our breakfast-cupf._Simply because there are not p oper officers
appointed at the different Custom-Houses to detect and check the
importation of adulterated articles of food.
e swarm with excisemen of every species, each consuming the
revenue,which he is paid to secure, and inflicting more or less annoy:
ance in his vocation. Our coasts, to resist the intrusion of undutiful
brandy, are lined with a preventive force, much more than sufficient to
defend them from the #. Shoals of Custom-House officers lie in
wait for every one who enters our ports, and keep you waiting half
the day to feel your pockets, or rummage your carpet-bag for a ſew
Cigars.
ºft, all this trouble, to keep a little contrabrand tobacco out of HER
MAJESTY's dominions, and no care to prevent the introduction of black
lead, and Prussian blue, in large quantities, into the interiors of her
subjects?
These questions are suggested by an article in the Liverpool Journal,
complaining that at Liverpool, that enormous inlet for imports (at pre-
sent largely adulterated), the Customs are unprovided with a Chemist,
whose business it might and ought to be, to search the various articles
imported by testing i. for rubbish and poison.
our Customs establishment is a common nuisance to the com-
mercial world, a pest to travellers, and an object of detestation to every-
body but those employed in it, and as it probably costs twice the
amount that would be lost by the smuggling it prevents, the only satis-
factory reason for its maintenance, that can be conceived by the think-
ing mind, is, that it affords scope for patronage. This last consideration
º perhaps, induce the Government—however indifferent in respect
of Prussian blue, or anything else in connexion with tea, so long as the
whole, pays duty—to add to the Custom-House officials, at Liverpool,
and elsewhere, a Chemical Officer, to be employed as a Preventive
against that, sort of smuggling by which our food and medicines are
poisoned and polluted.
WERY MEAN.—We hear that an order is about to issue from the
Home Office to the Governors of gaols, commanding them to make
all refractory female prisoners wear the Bloomer Costume.

THE LAST DODGE OF THE RUINED FARMER,
ſº Y far the
º strongest ar-
º fº. We
} have yet seen
in favour of
Protection, is to be
found in the following
advertisement, ex-
tracted from one of
the Manchester news-
papers.
FARMER's Daughter,
in the 27th year of her
age, is desirous of meeting
with a PARTNER for
LIFE. On her marriage-
day she will be entitled to
a property worth upwards of £5000, which has recently been left by a deceased
relative. She is by profession a Baptist: and, under very peculiar circumstances,
advertises thus through a friend. None but respectable parties, whose character
will bear the strictest investigation, need apply. A pious, well-meaning man will
be preferred. Any person requiring information on the subject, must send a Post-
office order for 8s., the amount of this advertisement.—Address,
After this, who will deny that the Farmers require some protection
or at all events, some looking aſter? How touching is this picture o
filial devotion, in which the farmer's daughter comes forward with one
desperate effort, to save the ruined farmer by an appeal to the unmarried
portion of the public—not for a husband to take an encumbrance off a
struggling parent's hands—but for an unlimited number of Post-office
orders for eight shillings' - -
Who can resist the demand which is so speciously blended with the
prospect of a wife with 5000l. on her marriage-day, and who will pause
to think about a paltry eight shillings for even the smallest chance in
such a splendid lottery? -
Every farmer who has a daughter may hope for much more from filial
duty than a five-shilling duty; for the former may have all the advan-
tages of a sliding-scale, and the produce, in Post-office orders, may all
go into the farmer's own pocket. We can ..º. the preference
which the advertisement expresses for a! serious' young man, as no
one capable of seeing a joke will be likely to part with eight shillings
for the promised information.
FUNNY MARKET AND WITTY INTELLIGENCE.
As our daily contemporaries are in the habit of giving an article on
the Money Market and City Intelligence, we think that for our readers
the latest accounts of the Funny Market and Witty Intelligence will
ssess some interest. The English funds of humour have been very
uoyant to-day, and Stock jokes were quoted at an advance., Long
ambiguities were not much in demand, and active or practical jokes leſt
off with a downward tendency. - - -
There is some talk in facetious circles of establishing a Pun Exchange;
!. suggestion is said to have the support of some of the old
Jobbers. -
An uneasy feeling has been excited by the failure of an extensive
operator in chaff; but as he was known to have derived all his supplies
lately from one Miller, the failure was, in some degree, looked for.
The Comundrum fever has broken out again with great violence;
and we think it right to warn the public against being deceived by
specimens which are being daily th. upon, the market, as the
precious ore of wit, when upon examination it will be found to contain
none of the true metal. e have ourselves received a few samples
which have been left at our office, by reckless adventurers, and which
are placed here as a warning to others. The following is so palpable
that it speaks for itself, and convicts its author at once of getting
funny under false pretences:- - - -
“If the Doge of Venice went to a masquerade, after telling his wife
he was going to spend the evening with a sick friend, what sort of a
Dodge would you call it?”—“A Venetian Blind!”
The Joker's Protection. Society have just issued their half-hourly
circular, in which they caution the public against receiving stolen jokes,
and print the opinion of MR. DuNUP on the º: question
whether a person imay be prosecuted for receiving a joke, knowing it to
be stolen?". The learned gentleman intimates that as the act mentions
any kind of property, and as there are many persons whose sole pro-
perty consists in their wits, which they are obliged to live upon, a
stolen joke would be within the statute. What would amount to a
receiving, is, in MR. DUNUP's opinion, a very nice point; and he thinks
there must be, at least, one laugh, including an overt act by the opening
of the mouth, to render the receiver liable. He is inclined, also, to
believe that a person turning pale at hearing a stolen joke, has not even
a colourable possession. T. learned gentleman suggests a very
ingenious difficulty in drawing an indictment for joke-stealing, where
the thief and the owner are both diners-out, and where the latter having
a joke on the tip of his tongue, the other takes it out of his mouth; in
which case, one may be said to take the bread out of the mouth of the
other. The difficulty then arises as to whether the property should be
laid in the indictment as ajº: or as bread; and MR. DUNUP advises,
therefore, that there should be two counts, one charging the prisoner
with stealing “two hundred jokes, and one hundred puns, fifty conun-
drums, one hundred repartees;” and another count, charging the
prisoner with having stolen some bread; “to wit: two šu.".
rolls, fifty half-quarterns, one hundred cottage loaves,” &c, &c., in the
usual form of an indictment. Our private letters give us the following,
as about the average of this week's issues;–“Why does a coat get
larger when taken out, of a carpet-bag f"—“Because when taken out,
you find it in-creases.”
MAGIC OF HORSE-HAIR.
THE Judges of the County Courts do not care for attornies; whereas
–(we give this upon the authority of MR. CLARKE, solicitor, who
announced the gratifying truth at a late attornies' meeting)—whereas
the Judges of the Superior Courts had “trembled”—trembled was the
word—“before the independence of the bar.” And the cause of
this salutary fear and trembling was in the wigs of the advocates.
MR. CLARKE
“Thought that the Judges of the County Courts, if addressed by a gentleman in
horse-hair, of as much learning, and perhaps, greater experience than themselves,
would pay much more respect to their opinion than to a mere attorney.”
There cannot, upon a fair amount of contemplation, be a doubt of the
mysterious fact. What a small, perked thing is a wigless attorney to
a wigged barrister!, }
“And justice draws us with a single hair,”
says amended Pope. Man's respect is caught, springed by horse-hair,
like woodcocks. ... “When the law lays down its full-bottomed periwig,”
says the prophetic CUMBERLAND, “you will find less wisdom in bald
º: than you are aware of.” ere be truths!. The origin of
arristers’ wigs is popularly attributed to the device of the monks, who
with, such covering hid the tonsure, when they turned advocates and
pleaded in Court. For ourselves, we have no doubt that the beginning
of lawyers' wigs is to be discovered in a very, remote antiquity. The
genealogy of wigs is yet to be given with the like precision as the
pedigree of Arab horses, traced to the mare of MAHOMET. When this
is done, we doubt not that the first horse-hair used for the first
Chancery wig was hair grown in the manes and tails of the horses of
DIoMEDE; and they—it is allowed—lived by devouring men.
FREE TRADE IN MARRIAGE.
WE understand that a parish in Bethnal Green is placarded with an
intimation that there has been a REDUCTION IN MARRIAGE FEEs, and
that the fatal noose will, in fact, be tied at a frightfully low scale of
charges... It seems that, for the purpose, probably, of carrying out the
maxim, that “a good wife is a crown to her husband,” the price of
obtaining one has been brought down to exactly five shillings. The
following is the new tariff:—
£ s. d.
Publication of Banns . - - - • 0 1 0
Minister's Fee - - - - . . 0 2 6
Clerk's Fee - - - - - . 0 0 9
Sexton's Fee - - - - . . 0 0 9
iſ, O 5 0
We have already got the “cheap loaf,” but the idea of giving the
public a cheap wife is rather a novel one. The laudable example set in
Bethnal Green will, most probably, lead to much competition; and we
shall see hand-bills jº. “Look herº! Wives, positively given
Away !” distributed all over the Metropolis. It will be rather ominous
to allude to a marriage as an “Alarming Sacrifice,” but when the tide
of rivalry once sets in among the parsons, there is no knowing where it
may carry them. We shall not be surprised to find widowers tempted
by offers of a marriage at half-price, and, perhaps, it may be held out as
an inducement to whole families to marry off at once, that there will be
“a great reduction on taking a quantity.” We are friends to cheapness,
even in taking a wiſe, though she may often turn out dear in more senses
than one; and we therefore submit to the clerical profession, whether
a still further reduction may not be effected by cutting of the sexton,
for whose services at a wedding we can see no necessity.
LOVE AND PUNCH.
The RE is but one Love, says Rochefoucauld, though there are a
thousand vile copies, of it; and, in the same way, there is but one
Punch, though there have been a thousand stupid imitations of it.

COAL AND KOH-I-NOOR.
(Being a Dialogue PUNCH heard in the Crystal
Palace.)
THE Crystal Fount was sleeping,
And hushed the merry tune
Of its streams, that, tired of leaping,
Lay broad beneath the moon;
And near, two Shades were keeping
Their watch at midnight's noon.
One, a giant, smirched and wizened,
Uncouth and huge of size;
Like a great furnace glistened
The red fire in his eyes;
In his voice methought I listened
To a volcano's i.
The other was a maiden.
Of beauty dusk and dim,
Luscious, and languor-laden
Was flung each rounded limb;
Koh-i-Noor Gnome.
Do homage to my beauty;
The diamonds' Queen am I;
Fealty, and Faith, and Duty,
Bow down when I go by:
But thou art scarred and sooty,
And loathsome to come migh.
Coal Gnome.
Though lovely to the gazer,
Maiden, I may not be,
Greater than King or Kaiser,
I travelland and sea;
Nature, and what obeys her,
Are subject unto me.
Koh-i-Noor Gnome.
Much blood hath flowed around me;
I’ve lit men to their graves;
Their conqueror conquerors found me;
I have turned saints toknaves;
Though many lords have boundme,
Koh-i-Noor Gnome.
I in Beauty's splendour,
º breast I fall and rise,
More lightm#rays can lend her
Than her own sun-bright eyes;
And when all men commend her,
The praise is mine likewise.
Coal Gnome.
The poor man's dress I cheapen,
I cheer the poor man's hearth;
Tunnel and mine I deepen,
Bring wealth from under earth;
By me the corn is reapen, -
Ground, baked, and stored 'gainst dearth.
Koh-i-Noor Gnome.
It was a cage all golden! .
That high for me they raised,
And my bars were still enfolden
By a crowd that gaped and gazed.
I was weary of being beholden,
*Midshawls, and hair gold-braiden, My masters are my slaves. And weary of being praised.
Her eyes did flash and swim. Coal Gnome Coal
Now, list to my rehearsing, Peace at º birth presided; These crystal bays that sunder
As Itell you, sooth and sure, I forged her chariot wheel; Those western engine piles,
Of the Indian maid's commercing
With the giant dark and dour-
Of the Gnome of the Coalconversing
With the Gnome of the Koh-i-Noor.
Though to ill hands confided,
I’ve toiled at murd’rous steel,
The loom by me is guided,
And turned the rattling reel.
From where the organ's thunder
Rolls through yon eastern aisles-
This palace, with all its wonder
Is my work of leisure whiles.
ANOTHER DEMAND FOR JUSTICE.
“MR. PUNCH,
“AFTER, the neglect I have experienced, it’s of no use at all
to appeal to the Royal Commissioners; not the least. Ishan’t petition
Parliament, or trouble PRINCE ALBERT. Iscorn such means. I appeal
to gº for justice, which I feel sure is my only plan.
“All sorts of people have been knighted, and have had medals and
honourably-mentiomeds, and all that—and been asked to Windsor, and
received bracelets, and letters autographed and lithographed—except me.
Not that I would take a knighthood, mark you—not I. That would be
putting myself on the levelof an Alderman or a Sheriff—if nothing better
came with it; and City men, though they do boast of their feasts and
their eating and drinking, I look down upon from my loftier position
with contempt. ...But I have not even been offered that. MR. Paxton
planned the building, and a very beautiful thing...it’s been, and he
deserves all that he’s got or will get—and more. Then there’s Cubitt
—he told them how to put the thing together; and then there’s Fox–
(I speak of 'em in this familiar, matter-of-fact way, because they’re all
friends of mine)—there's Fox, I say, he built it all up-iron, and glass,
and the rest—and trouble enough it was, no doubt. But what’s their
trouble and labour to mine?...Nobody knows what I have gone through;
and nobody could know till the whole thing was finished. But now the
sum total’s been made out, just look at it... Just look here, Mr. Punch

toughest work to do:-

PROPOSAL FOR A NEW GOOSE CLUB.
UR readers are aware that the period has
arrived, when the homely goose, depicted
in water-colours, announces to the neigh-
bourhood from the windows of public-
houses, that a “Goose Club” is in course
of formation within. . .
Punch proposeth to establish a New
Goose Club, whereof the commercial
principle shall be the same, but whereof
the ultimate benefit will be to the sub-
scribers much greater.
The common Goose Club undertaketh,
for the weekly sixpence of instalment, to
provide to the subscriber at Christmas, a
Goose and a bottle of Gin. --
Punch proposeth to receive an instal-
ment, but to provide to the subscriber
something more nutritious than goose,
something more beneficial than gin.
* For Punch proposeth that the Fast Man, or the Idle Youth, shall pay
his weekly sixpence, and that at Christmas he shall receive some de-
lectable intellectual nutriment, highly beneficial to him. Let the Fast
Man, or Idle Youth, pay his sixpence, and receive-
A Copy of Whate º Logic/
A Copy of the Vicar of Wakefield/ -
Consider, my brethren, the sad intellectual destitution that prevaileth
amongst you—the long Christmas nights, wherein the tedium of vacancy
will make you mutiny against the nature of things, and blasphemo
declare, this noble Planet “slow!” Consider this, my brethren-an
subscribe.
This is the true Goose Club-which doth not propose the slaughter
of the Goose, but rather the benefit, and improved condition of the
same.

GROSS
INDIGNITY TO GOG AND MAGOG.
– HE heroic Kossuth, ex-
ſº of Hungary,
as, it will have been
observed, in his clever
and judicious speeches,
laid particular stress
upon our municipal in-
stitutions, whilst laud-
ing the glorious British
constitution at large.
By a curious coinci-
dence, a case occurred
last week at the Man-
sion House, which
must exhibit to the
eyes of foreigners, in
a striking light, the
importance of corpo-
rate bodies, as in-
stanced by the vin-
dicated majesty of the
municipality of Lon-
don, that had been
insulted in the person
of one of its officers,
A monster of inso-
lence, named WILLIAM
LIGHTERMAN, Was
brought before the
- - LoRD MAYor, charged
with having used language calculated to provoke a breach of the peace towards an
individual of the superb and splendid band of watermen employed in rowing the
civic barge. The language in question consisted of irreverent expressions reflecting
on the tasteful and picturesque costume worn by those fine fellows, who carry the
CAESAR of the City and his fortunes. The defendant set the waterman a nick-
name, which, though qualified with the title of “My Lord,” is one regarded as
contumacious even when applied to the most inferior description of bailiff.
By this derisive appellation was the waterman of the Lord MAYok continually
saluted by the little boys—too prone to º: their disrespectful sentiments to
every official habited in the ſaintest guise of a beadle. , Not content with jeering,
and instigating these youthful scoffers to jeer the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, as
represented by their servant, this wicked LIGHTERMAN had, on several occasions,
put his ... to his nose, and we may safely conclude had also twiddled his
fingers, at that highly respectable and decorated officer. For this high crime and
misdemeanour he was fined ten shillings, and held to bail for good behaviour for six
months, being threatened with heavier punishment in the event of similar mis-
conduct in future. Kossuth, who has so grand an idea of our corporate bodies
and who knows what it is to struggle for municipal rights, will doubtless feel
interested in observing how the Court of the Mansion House, if it has not tyrants
and despots to contend against, can nevertheless assert its dignity on occasion: as
against impudent fellows and little boys who “chaff” its watermen.
“CEASE, LOUD BOREAS.”
THERE is a practice gradually creeping into literary advertising which, we
are determined to “put down.”. It is the practice of sticking in among “Opinions
of the Press” the private opinions, delivered in private letters, by private indivi-
duals. It is a little too bad that the civil expressions of an author should be made
public to puff a book—just as the letters of patients are used to magnify the merits
of a new pill or old humbug.
Besides, it is to be remarked that a copious use of asterisks on these occasions
too clearly tells that some qualifying expression has been omitted. If the cor-
respondent, for example, expresses himself thus:–“Your poems, were they as fine
as MILTON's, could scarcely redeem the ill taste of your preface,” &c.—the puffer
coolly puts down “as fine as Milton’’ to the tail of his advertisement, and
makes the writer responsible for that assertion.
We suppose that any ordinary courtesy of phrase delivered in the street, or
at table, to these puffers, will soon be brought into the advertising columns in the
same way. We may expect “Opinions” like these:–
... An interesting work.”—Huggles (to my wife “at Jon Es's party”).
“Pleasantly written.”—PRofessor BRAY (at dessert).
“Really an extraordinary performance.”—KINDER (in the Park).
“Worthy of the author.”—Punch (with emphasis).
In print, too, any gestures or looks with which the said phrases were accompanied,
are lost—much, ãº. to the puffer's advantage.
The Universal Inn.
THAT ubiquitous hostelry, “The Marquis of Granby,” ought, in compliment to
the distinguished champion of the landlords', interest, whose name it so appro-
priately bears, to be entitled the House of Call for Squires.

COUNTY COURT POETRY.
“SIR,
“ANxious to combine pleasure with instruction
in every work of life, and knowing, that without poetry
that life would be dark and wearisome indeed, it has often
struck me that our police reports, were they metrically
and, at the same time, faithfully rendered, might affor
much pleasure to many elegant minds which are now
turned away from that wholesome reading by the repulsive
style of the narration.
“I have turned the report of a late speech of MR.
RAMsHAy’s in the Liverpool County Court into a blank
verse, which is not without its charm; and shall be happy
to do the Chancery and Old Bailey reports in the same
manner, for any journal that may be in want of a rhythmical
reporter. Gents are invited to inspect the original report
with mine as amended, and a single trial will prove the
perfect adaptability of the most stately decasyllabic verse
to the most intricate and crabbed questions of law.

This morning, by the windows being closed;
And as there be a many persons here,
I'll mark my sense of disobedience strongly,
Because I deem ’tis not the Judge's business
To waste his time with such a matter as this.
[The Court-Keeper, John Whiteside, then appears.
*Ramshay. Why oped ye not these windows, Court-
eeper?
The Keeper. I had no orders.
Judge Ramshay. Sayye, ye’d no orders ?
The Keeper. I thought that it was very cold this morning.
Judge Ramshay. What! cold?—and with a crowded Court
like this!
I shall impose a fine, Sir, of ten shillings,
For not attending to my orders given-
Aye, and repeatedly given, on this subject.
I {j it must be most uncomfortable—
Unpleasant—for all persons in this Court.
I shall inflict a fine, them, of ten shillings,
For disobeying my orders on this subject,

Which now have been neglected, and without
Any whatever justifiable ground.
I think, for life and health, fresh air's essential.
Shut in close Courts, I well-nigh lost my life,
And don't intend to have the thing again.

To make the character of Pantaloon still more ridiculous,
we are informed that all the Pantaloons in the forthcoming
pantomimes will be supported by Bloomers. This is said
to be the first time that the Panſaloons will ever be

that the effect will be exceedingly rich Several of the
Bloomers have been studying the character for some time
past in public, and are already declared to be extremely
ridiculous in the part.

tired of “standing,” we fancy, by this time!

minds possessed of but one idea, and that the idea of dear corn! What an
awful thing to hear them actually grumble at peace, because wheat
sold at so high a rate during the war, or complain of the abundant har-
vest, on account of its cheapening grain! ow pitiable the state of
these poor creatures, who believe that machinery is ruining the country;
who are persuaded that no way is so good as the old one—not even the
railway—and who denounce Free Trade, condemn the repeal of the
bread-tax, and execrate the memory of SIR. Robert PEEL in terms that
will not bear repetition 1
And why—demands ADAM RICARD0 SMITH-are these rough—yet
honest—victims of prejudice and delusion to be abandoned to their
fallacies? Must they . given up as wholly impracticable? Shall no
friendly hand be stretched forth to grasp their benumbed fists, and help
their dead-weight out of the mire? Well, ADAM RICARDo SMITH, you
will be rejoiced to hear that such a benevolent attempt has been made;
with what success if you would know, come, ADAM, and accompany us
to the Top-Booted School.
This unique educational institution, MR. SMITH, was founded | an
enterprising *::"...' to whom the idea of it was suggested by
the success of the Ragged Schools. ... Enter. No, you are not mistaken,
good Sir: it is conducted in a public-house. The founder was a man
of the world, Sir. He knew he should never induce those whom he
sought to instruct to assemble in a Mechanics' Institute, or a lecture-
room. So, like a sensible fellow, he took the Barley Mow Inn, close
to the Corn Market, and set about the accomplishment of his humane
purpose in the natural—we may say, endearing-character of landlord.
You may suppose that, in the execution of his design, he at first
encountered some opposition. Who was he f what did he know about
it? what call had he got to “intervere?” were the most moderate of the
demands that were roared at him, when he made a beginning of his
project by stating a few of the simpler principles of Political Econom
at his .
in the common room. Gibes, if not jokes, were lanched
and tumblers would probably have followed, but for fear of the expense
of breakage. And now, Sir, behold the result
Before you is a School for adult, farmers, based on the principle of
mutual instruction. We have called it a Top-Booted School—however,
you see there are leggings and gaiters in it as well as top-boots. Hark!
A member of the society has just read a paper—another proceeds to
deliver his opinion on the leading article. É. his facts and figures—
had you any idea that such an amount of statistics and arithmetic could
be contained in that bullet head? He is interrupted by an opposite
neighbour—really with some degree of politeness—who denies that
land can be considered as raw material. A discussion ensues—none
the drier for good liquor, nor the more obscure for a little smoke: for
in this school they allow grog, beer, and pipes–Bacco and tobacco,
as the Italians say.
Mark yonder expansive red face, supported by those two broad
palms. It indicates little philosophy—except, as you might say, the
Chaw-Baconian; yet the owner of it has arrived very nearly to
the perception of the law of supply and demand. There is a back
turned toward us; its breadth, you see, is remarkable. , Yet the
F. principles are broader than his loins—as broad as they
ormerly were narrow. Listen—he joins in the conversation. “If we
takes”—he has but recently commenced grammar—“if we takes their
carn,” he observes, “they’ll take our mannifacturs; and zo it’s as
broad as 'tis long.” He is, you perceive, Sir, as MR. DisBAELI called
his South Bucks audience the other day, a man of substance, as well as
a man of sense; though the latter has only begun to glimmer. But
then it has but just been illumined by instruction.
That burly yeoman, now grinning from ear to ear at the speaker's
refutation of a protectionist fallacy, Sir, is regularly “up” in .
and will be happy to initiate you into the mysteries of thorough
drainage—or will explain the beer-engine to you, if you prefer that.
Our friend in the nailed boots is a mechanician, and has invented a clod-
crusher, which is even more effective than his chaussure. Chemistry is
the hobby of yonder gentleman of stable-minded apparel and phy.
siognomy. Hear him, talk about the superphosphate of lime !—and a
i. ago, Sir, he didn't know the difference, chemically speaking,
tween the carbonate of that alkaloid and caseine. And when we
tell you that, most of these gentlemen, with the help of a dictionary,
read your valuable works, we hope you will not be dissatisfied with
your visit to the Top-Booted School, . ADAM RICARD0 SMITH.

W H E R E | S
EQUESTRIANs can, we know, ride almost any number of horses at
once; for we have seen the artist hanging by the hand to the mane of
one animal, holding on by the feet to the tail of a second, with his arm
round the ear of a third, his elbow supported on the back of a fourth,
and the tip of his toe resting on the neck of a fifth; but we cannot
understand how the same feats can be going on in two places on the
same evening. We have, however, lately had Mazeppa at Astley's,
and, Mazeppa at the Marylebone Theatre, on the same night, and the
wild horse of the desert has been urging on his wild career through the
Steppes of Tartary near the steps of Westminster Bridge, as well as
some other Steppes that have been lately got up, for the purpose, at
Paddington.
We see by the playbills that the Foung Chieftain (Hicks) and the
original old Khan (CRowTHER) have abdicated their Lambeth domi-
nions, and sought a new territory in the neighbourhood of Portman
Market, where the young Khan and the old Khan are causing, in
managerial phraseology, “a succession of overflows.” Whether there
has been an emigration also of the “Tartar hordes" we are not aware,
or whether there has been a local horde selected at a shilling a night

from the supernumerary population of Paddington. From the frantic
enthusiasm which AstLEY's Tartars always exhibited towards MR.
Hicks and the patriarchal old Khan, his father (MR. CRowTHER), we
might imagine §. the secession of the chiefs had been accompanied
by the secession of the underlings; but the recollection comes upon us
that nothing is more hollow than the adherence of a theatrical popu-
lation to a dramatic hero, and that the old original Tartar, horde that
has been hailing MR, Hicks as its hope, and clinging to the knees of
MB, CRowTHER as its father, for 587 successive nights, will hail and
cling to any other youthful heir and aged sire that MR. BATTY may
think proper to place on the throne of Tartary. Such, alas! is life in
general; but theatrical life in particular.
We can imagine, however, some little difficulty among the unaccus-
tomed horses, for Mazeppa, entrusted to the hands or legs of a new
stud, will entail the necessity for a new study. We can, nevertheless,
imagine the groom, with a few yards of pack-thread, enticing the unaccus-
tomed animal into a “wild career,” and the stage carpenter behind the
brute with a couple of property wolves in profile, with “practicable”
heads, serve as a persuader to the “horse of the desert.”

To the Judge and Jury of the Lancashire County Court.
SIR,-MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HoNOUR:-
I HAVE not hitherto taken much notice of you, because I feared
that you had a claim upon the attention of the Lord CHANCELLOR, who
is the legal guardian of most persons who behave as you do. I now
address you to ask, whether, as a discoverer of new and extraordinary
powers on the part of County Court Judges, you have discovered that
you have the power to sentence a man to death for winking his eye at
you; and whether you think that you are possessed of power sufficient
to order me to come down and be hanged, if you choose, and to compel
me to obey you if I don't And further, I would beg you to tell me
whether, if the LoRD CHANCELLOR is not to look after you, you do not
think that the CHANCELLOR of THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ought to
dispose—somewhat otherwise than at present-of your Honour’s
wisdom.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SWEETS OF LOYALTY.
PARAGRAPH in the newspapers informed
us, the other day, that a MRs. Sonſ E-
Body, of Everton, had sent a few
ounces of Toffy to the juvenile mem-
bers of the Royal Family, and that
in exchange for these ounces, a few
|...; to five in gold—
had been forwarded to the Toffy mer-
chant. We need hardly say that we
think the whole story a hoax, and
that the sweet-stuff has no existence
anywhere, but in the sugary brain of
the writer of the paragraph. In the
first place, we think HER MAJESTY is
not likely to be imposed upon by such
a palpable trick as sending a present
of a quantity of tom-trot, or other
treacly trash, for the purpose of
getting a royal recompense'; and, in
the next place, we have every reason
to believe that the little Princes and
s. Princesses are not allowed to spoil
their little teeth, injure their little
digestions, and mess their little
- fingers with the sticky stuff, which
derives its name from the luscious little º and buttery town of
Everton. We believe it is the excellent rule of the Royal Establishment
to refuse to receive all the rubbish offered for acceptance at the Palace,
and indeed, if it were otherwise, the servants need have nothing else
to do but open the door to white-mice, †: bits of crochet
work, pet lambs, favourite goats, early spinach, and other humble pro-
ductions of nature or industry. We think it right to smash the story
of the Everton Toffy, to prevent Buckingham Palace being besieged
with hard-bake, overrun with tom-trot, and stormed by brandy balls.
THE EX-UNPROTECTED FEMALE ATTENDS A
LECTURE ON BLOOMERISM.
Scene.—Great Coram Street, and all the way to Dean Street, Soho.
The Ex-UNPROTECTED, and her strong-minded friend, Miss RUNT, have
effected their escape from the house, under shelter of MR. Jones's
temporary stupefaction (produced as described in our last scene). The
ºricº, in her triumphant revolt, has secured her bonnel
and shattl.
The Er-Unprotected. How dirty the streets are, to be sure!—Oh, do
mind the crossing, Miss RUNT |
Miss Runt (º) ºn inſense sense of superiority). Mud is perfectly in-
different to me, Mrs. Jon Es.
ſ * Er-Unprotected. Oh, I don't mind it—only I’m so afraid of wet
eet.
Miss Run! (calmly). The costume preserves me from all incon-
Wenlences—
[At this moment they are passing a gas-lamp, by whose light Miss
RUNT is suddenly revealed at full length, in the Bloomer costume
—a blue polka, a green skirt, and pink pantalettes.
The Er-Unprotected (suddenly bringing herself to an anchor against the
wall). Oh, goodness gracious me! Oh, Miss RUNT, I never did think
–Oh, how ever could you—
Miss Run! (proudly and coldly). If you allude to the costume, MRs.
Jones, I left my pelisse in your passage while you were putting on
your bonnet.
The Er-Unprotected. But you’re never going to walk all the way to
Dean Sreet, Soho, in these things?—(pointing in deep affliction to the
pink petiloons, alias panlalettes).
Miss Ruuſ (with awful calm). Such is my intention, MRs. Jones.
The Er-Unprotected (halting, and inclined to kneel to the strong-minded
one). Oh, dear me, Miss RUNT' Oh, please—it’s very quiet here in
Coram Street; but when we get into Holborn, there’ll be the naughty
blackguard little boys, and the cabmen, and—-

Jon Es, I am ready.

Miss Run! (with awful serenity). You can do so, MRs. Jones; but I
shall ride upon the box.
The ſº-Unprotected (teringing her hands). Oh, that will be worse than
eyer. They’ll think there’s another inside. They’ll throw mud and
things at us, Miss RUNT, and call us such names. Oh, really, you can't
think how your feet show !
Miss Runt (unmored). If violence is resorted to, I shall appeal to the
laws of my country. - - -
The Er:Unprotected. Oh, if that’s the police, I shouldn't wonder if
they put us in the station-house.
[A moving panorama of a hideous cell, followed by the Old Bailey and
the scaffold, passes before her in º: succession.
[At this moment they have reached Southampton Street. A Small Boy,
with a procer's basket, comes out of Little Ormond Street.
BILL, 'ere’s a Bloomer! -
Bill (appearing, as usual, from nowhere in particular). Oh, Crikey!
Ain't she a rum’un ?
The Er-Unprotected. Oh, it’s the boys!
Miss RUNT—(stopping short, and imploringly clinging to the martyr.)
Miss Runt (whose supply of strong-mindedness increases with the demand).
I shall drink my cup to the dregs, MRs. Jon Es.
Small Boy (delighted with Miss RUNT's lower eartremities). Oh, what
rummy trotters!
The Er-Unprotected. There! Oh, ain’t
you ashamed of yourself?
Bill (with the street boy’s car-whoop). Oo-ray! 'Ere’s bunnions!
[Small Boys collect with rapidity, only to be equalled by the grains of
wheat in the favourite arithmetical sum.
Miss Runt (who feels, from the increased weight on her arm, that the
Ex-UNPROTECTED is gradually sinking). Be firm, MRs. Jon Es!
[A PoliceMAN, the Waterman of the cab-stand, two or three Cabmen,
a Połłoy, several Servant Maids, on pressing errands, a Mil-
liner's Girl, with a basket, and other street waifs and strays,
drift together to the spot.
Policeman (sternly to the Ex-UNPROTECTED). Now, then, you musn't
be making no disturbances 'ere—old 'ooman.
The Er-Unprotected (roused, even in her far gone state, by the uncalled-
for insult). How dare you?
Pot-boy. That’s a reglar arſ-and-arf. I’ll toss you (to Policeman) man
or ’ooman P
Miss Runt (descending from the martyr's pile for an instant). Now
mind, I’ll have you boys taken up.–(Resuming her dignity) Police'
invoke the protection of the law.
Policeman (with a rague sense that he is being “chaffed”). Come, old
'ooman—we can’t have no }. 'ere—move on!—Come, now, all
you boys, stand back (repulsing them with a secret sympathy).
Er-Unprotected. Miss RUNT—I’m going to faint.
Policeman. Now, then—none of that 'ere—we can’t 'ave nobody
fainting 'ere, and creatin’ obstructions—Move on 1
The Er-Unprotected. Oh, please, man—(makes an abortire attempt to
touch the heart of a sententious Cahman).
First Sententious Cabman (remoning his pipe from his mouth, after a
steady surrey of Miss RUNT). Well—you ort to be a good'un over the
stones, you ort.
Second Sententious Cabman. Queerish about the 'ocks, JEM.
[Direr/issement—A wild dance of Small Boys, with the usual accom-
paniments.
Miss Runt (who begins to feel that one may have too much even of
martyrdom.) Now do make an effort, pray, MRs. Jones, and come
along.
The Er-Unprotected (feebly). Oh!—and there’s all the gas in Totten-
ham Court Road l–and market-night, too!
Waterman (conclusively). One’s a good plucked 'un-t'other isn't.
'Ere—'ave a cab, mum.
The Er. Unprotected (gaspingly). Yes—yes—
º: Runt. No-no. I feel strong in the good cause. I’ll go through
with it.
Policeman (impressively). If you’re a-going to the Casino de Wenus,
ź. 'd better’ave a cab, or you'll be gettin' yourselves in trouble, I can
ell you.
[Four cabs hare driven up on the intimation of the Ex-UNPROTECTED's
desire; the respective drivers are engaged in the usual conflict
over her body. She is at last conquered by one, and deposited,
in a prostrate condition, inside.
Miss Runt. At all events, I will go outside.
Chorus of Small Boys. Ooray! ooray!
[Miss RUNT takes her seat on the bor, in all the majesty of strong-
mindedness and woman's mission. The Small Boys form themselves
into a guard of honour, and follow the rehicle, generally pre .#
the fantastic mode of locomotion called the windmill, e pull
up the windows on the state of the Ex-UNPROTECTED inside.
It’s your legs, Miss RUNT.
The Proto-Bloomer.
JoAN of ARC may be said to have been the first Bloomer, as she
wore a short tunic with tights, and was otherwise also clad in mail
attire. But JoAN was executed for witchcraft. Now, the Bloomers
do not seem to be conjurors; and at least there is nothing very bewitching
in their appearance.
Small Boy (calling to his invisible, but invariable, associate). BILL!—oh,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 207
TO HOBKINS BLOBB, ESQ.,
Penny-a-Liner, &c., &c., &c.
º Y DEAR SIR,-I
-º- cannot sufficiently
admire one cha-
racteristic of your
tribe—one whic
has been very re-
markably display-
ed on a recent oc-
casion. I allude
to your delight-
ful versatility; to
the active way in
which you all suit
your reports to
the tone of the
£ºnal you report
Or.
Come, my dear
Sir, you know
what I am think-
ing of. Of Kos-
suTH, eh? Just
so. Don’t you, all of you, describe his appearance, his recep-
tion, his crowds, his voice, &c., favourably, or unfavourably, accord-
ing to what the political writers of your journals say of him? And
yet, you ought to be aware that your business is to report facts passing
under your º the writer has to deal with the political aspect of
the matter, which is quite a different thing.
You, MR, BLOBB, for example, narrate KossuTH's public appearances
for a #. which dislikes the principles of his party. And you do so
in a slighting, sneering way—intended to help (as you fancy) the cause.
MR. BloBB, did you ever hear what Socrates said when XANTiPPE,
after a hearty scold, drenched him with an unsavoury shower He
observed, that “after thunder, there generally came rain.” Such as
that unsavoury shower, M.R. BloBB, is your unhappy effort at sarcasm,
after your employer's thunder. You remind me of the sign-painter,
whose “Angel” resembled a “Red Lion,” as he remarked. Your way
of painting a high apparition, is to make it look like a grotesque animal.
#. MR. BLOBB, you talk of the “populace,” and “the rabble!”
What is your notion of a populace or a rabble? Dainty and graceful
aristocratſ Why, dear me, MR. BLOBB, who are you? Who was your
grandfather? What are your arms ? When do you date from ? What
clubs do you belong to—what houses do you dine at P. M.R. BLOBB
Why, this sneering at the “rabble” would be snobbish in a gentleman
of sixty quarterings. But in you!. It is really unkind-heartless of
you—the oracle of the “parlour”—to be thus severe on your own class.
Come, Sir, be alive to the claims of kindred. “Blood is thicker than
water,” says the proverb; and yours ought to be a good deal thicker,
for it seems considerably obstructed by bile.
Let theorists argue as they please on theories, MR. BLOBB. But
don’t let us have any falsity about public facts. Don't you and your
compeers go on treating the public as certain Egyptians (vide
HERODOTUs) were wont to treat the captured crocodile. How was
that—you don't remember, it in HERomâTUs (as you call him)?—Why,
to be able to secure him all right—they blinded him by flinging mud in
his eyes!
33U$2C{ſ}.
Yours,
PUNCH*S SANITARY COMMISSION.
THE inquiries of the Lancet's Commission have struck terror into the
hearts of the eating public. They have revealed to us the exten-
siveness of a system of adulteration which pollutes our coffee-pots,
degrades our loaves, gives bitterness to our sugar, and danger to our
milk. Pope asked long ago—
“Why has not man a microscopic eye?”
and proceeded to answer the query in conformity with his system, by
saying—
“For this plain reason—man is not a fly.”
We should be inclined to answer, that it was for this plain-or,
indeed, ugly reason, that if man had, he would be obliged to die from
starvation from the impossibility of eating his daily food, as his daily
food is now prepared for him. -
But shall not the thinking, the reading public, be protected as well as
the eating one? Yes, we reply. Punch recently appointed a Commis-
sion to examine the mental food vended by some dealers in the metro:
polis. The packages were purchased at various shops, and submitted
to the scientific analysis of some gifted contributors. We extract from
their Report.
Lot l.-The Comic Penny Titillator :
(This was announced by the salesmen in the thoroughfares to be
by the ". writers.”)
Adulterated. With much lead, and with something apparently com-
posed of brass filings and common mud. Also, granules were found of
old jokes, in a state of decomposition, ground.
Lot 2.-The Secrets of the Bosphorus!
(Sold to the poorer classes as a “stirring romance,” and we believe
in large quantities.)
Very much adulterated. With lead as before, and with impure ma-
terials. Also with an odd stuff that seemed to your Commissioners to
be the parings of asses' hoofs. Traces, or hints of blood, also, occa-
sionally.
Lot 3.-The Moribund Pillowslip.
(Called a “sound religious publication.”)
Adulterated. Cant, three grains to every five. Wery fiery.
The Commissioners, in closing the Report, from which we quote,
affirm that such adulteration as that of which the above are specimens,
exists extensively among the intellectual food of the lower orders. Lead,
to be sure, is found occasionally mixed with the productions of very large
establishments, but the adulteration of the most deadly character
presses, like all adulteration, most heavily on the poor.
KOSSOOTH.
SAYs Dick to BILL–says DICK–“By Jove!
That 'ere Kossooth’s a plucky cove.”
“Well, so he is,” says BILL to Dick,
“Blow'd if he ain't a reglar brick,
A precious good speech, too, I call
That one as he made at Guildhall.”
“Yes,” Dick replies, “’twas all on 't fair;
There warn’t no Commonism there;
There warn’t no treason nor sedition;
His words 'll all bear repetition.”
“Ay,” answers BILL, “so I agree;
But yet some says, What is 't to we ?
They argues he’s a foreigneer,
And we’ve no call to interfere
With other folks and their affairs;
Let we mind ourn, and they mind theirs.”
“Ah!” Dick says, “yes: look on and see
The wust oppression as can be.
Let Austria hang 'em—Russia knout 'em,
And never take no thought about 'em!
Stand with your hands in pockets, chinkin’
Your cash—of nuffin else a thinkin’.
Let 'em alone, men's wives to leather,
And chain chaps day and night together.
Let tyrants torture—victims linger—
Nor raise to help 'em woice nor finger.”
"No, no!” cries BILL; “no, I’m be blest!
Whilst I’ve a heart inside my breast,
For patriots, whether French or Dutch–
Providing they behaves as such—
That lands upon old England's shore,
I’ll holler—if I can’t do more.”
“Well, come,” says Dick, “a pint I’ll stand;
Welcome Kossooth to Britain's land;
To drink good health to such a chap,
BARCLAY AND PERKINs is the tap;
That is the proper stuff to tope
To one as 'scaped from HAYNAU's rope.”
“With all my heart! So let it be;
“His health !” shouts BILL, “with three times three *
JUDGE RAMSHAY ON LAW.
RAMshay still sits on the Liverpool bench. To be sure, his case, at
the time we write, is to be considered on the 5th of November. The
appropriate 5th. RAMSHAY and Gunpowder FAwkes. But RAMSHAy,
ere he departs for that official oblivion whence, no RAMSHAY. Qught to
return, has enlightened his court with his opinions upon English law.
“He said it was generally supposed that the law was a system of chicanery. It
was, however, the result of the deliberations of the wisest men, and the essence of
good sense."
There are great popular mistakes. The English Judge, for instance,
is generally supposed to be always, the “essence ºf good sense;’
- - - >
whereas there may be exceptions to this rule;—some Judges being the
“essence” of RAMSHAY.

KossuTH has made his triumphal entry into the city of London.
The Austrian Ambassador, with wise forecast of the reception that
awaited the great Hungarian—who ought, many a month since, accord-
ing to the legitimacy of desrotism, to have filled a grave—the Austrian,
turned upon his heel, and for a while went his way. That Kossuth
ought to have sº a meal to the double-headed Eagle—never to be
gorged to the full with such provender;--and the rebel had balked the
destiny prepared him, had foiled young Joseph and his master Czar,
baffled all odds, and was here—to utter a discourse confounding the
policy of the would-be “gaolers” of the human race. A most pestilent,
most perplexing change!, When the rebel should have been in his
grave, and there he was, breathing words of flame, a living preaching
apostle of man's freedom, in the Guildhall of London! i.
had good right to bite its nails, and curse the SULTAN.
Kossuth's progress from his home in Eaton-square—made, for the
while, entirely his, by the true-hearted Englishman, whose roof-tree is
or ever honoured § its sometime tenant—Kossuth's progress to
Guildhall doors, was a triumph swelling and deepening at every step.
There was no attempt at show; the man himself was the display: the
noble spectacle. The man, whose master-mind had held all Austria at
bay—the man, whose voice was as a trumpet to his country’s heart—
the man, outraged in his nation, whose |im. principle he embodied
and represented, was revealed to the eyes of Englishmen, and they hung
upon that glorious manifestation, with looks of reverence, of love, and
sympathy. It was not merely Louis Kossuth whom the thousands
gazed upon and cheered; it was Hungary; bound and bleeding—but
still hopeful, resolute, defying Hungary.
Kossuth was nobly attended on his way from his home to the
Guildhall; for the hearts of Englishmen went along with him: of
the men who in their aggregate make “the people.” It is true that
KossuTH had with him no English Peer; no star, no garter, made a
part of the show: the great Hungarian was not patronised by any of
the mighty ones of the House of Lords; no, Kossuth had with him
for his escort the people; nothing more ; simply, the people.
“Why is it,” asked Cobden at the Southampton Banquet, “why is
it that the name of Louis Kossuth is heard at the firesides of the
middle classes, and I would fain hope of the higher classes, one of whom
we number among our visitors to-day P” One of whom That “one”
was, of course, LoRD DUDLEY STUART; whom we can scarcely consider
“one.” Surely, by this time, he has disfranchised himself; for so many
years has that strange Lord associated his active sympathies with the
oppressed and down-trodden of all lands, that he must have almost read
himself out of the Court Guide. , Has he not sadly compromised nobility
by his doings with humanity—has he not well-nigh forfeited the Lord
in his zeal for the people P
“One of the higher classes 1’’. Yet how many talking units of the
aristocracy in Parliament, and, at certain seasons on the hustings, are
loud and animated in their advocacy of popular freedom! The great
champion, great and glorious in his passing defeat, escapes the car-
nivorous jaws of despotism; a man of consummate genius and of noblest
worth—a God's true man evades, by grace of infidel, the hangman's
hands of Christian Emperors, and—save and except that eccentric one
Lord Stuart—there is neither £arl nor Lord to bid the exile welcomei
But their absence is their own shame; the cause of Kossuth, as it is a
cause deep and wide as humanity, can do without them: though, in
these days, it may be scant wisdom in themselves to aid in the preaching
of that social lesson. ...And yet, among the aristocracy, there might have
been found men, with at least a traditional respect for suffering
patriotism. There have been heads on the Temple Bar that KossuTH
assed through, that even now speak to us—there was a head that fell
in Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields—a few paces to the left of Kossuth, on his way
to Guildhall—that now utters and will still utter solemn teachings.
Yet no live Peer—no breathing liberality of the House of Lords—said
welcome to Louis Kossuth. Well, the people of London did the
honours; and so the great Hungarian may excuse the peerage. To
be sure, if RADETZKY or PASKEVITCH were to come to London—may,

putting aside the dread of sheriff's officers for certain unpaid damages,
were SchwartzENBURG himself to visit the Metropolis—great would be
the welcome of the illustrious new-comers. The doors of palatial
mansions would turn on their harmonious hinges to take them in.
How, for instance, did English aristocracy kiss the boots of Nicholas
--how did the fair English aristocracy mantle and blush, sublimated for
life, º the condescending salute of the emperor: at the imperial touch,
mere human blood became ichor?
Kossuth went his victorious way to Guildhall; and there, in a brief
hour, did, good battle against Austria and Russia.-There, in that
pacific hall, the Hungarian did as mortal injury to despotism, as did
ever his iron artillery. Some words are things; things irresistible as
cannon-balls; but with an immortality in them not to º spent. Such
words are the words of God-gifted men; of men like Kossuth; whom
to hear, is to listen to a noble human lesson—whom to look at, seen
through the glorious halo of his deeds and sufferings, is a sight that for
the time ennobles the beholder.
Kossuth went to receive the homage paid him by the people of the
City of London, without pomp-without display. The straight-forward
simplicity of the man found fitting harmony in the unstudied welcome
that was given him by the mere people. The people were at once his
ards and his entertainers. And for the foul, miserable lies, made to
lacken the name of a man whose reputation is unspotted—lustrous as
a sunbeam—they, too, were represented—typified, and to be found in
the dirt in the path of Kossuth—the dirt trodden by the feet of
Kossuth's horses.
THE BLOOMER BALL.
(Suggested by ALFRED TENNyson’s “Locksley Hall.”)
GENTs! produce your fifteen shillings; take a cab, and º the fare:
Bid the driver wait till wanted, near to Hanover's famed Square.
'Tis the place; and all around it crowds collect, who shout and call
At the people driving onwards to attend the Bloomer Ball:
Bloomer Ball—that in the papers promised much that might attract
Quite an overflow of people, rushing like a cataract.
Many a night to yonder uilding have Ijourney’d, nicely dress'd,
To a ball or evening concert, patronised by all the West:
Many a night I saw the broughams coming forward through the shade,
Glittering, with their lamps all lighted, like a line ºf silver braid.
-
Oh! my Bloomers, chicken-hearted 1, Oh! my Bloomers, what a fall!
Oh! the dreary, dreary aspect of the barren Bloomer Ball!
Seedier than fancy dresses; dirtier than Showman's stocks,
Half-a-dozen pairs of trousers, half-a-dozen school-girls' frocks.
'Tis as well, perchance, that ladies should avoid the London dirt,
By a higher range of clothing and a somewhat shorter skirt;
But it cannot be expected we shall ever see the day
When, in gentlemanly trousers, they’ll be figuring away.
As the husband, shall the wife be; he will have to wear a gown,
If he does not quickly make her put her Bloomer short-coats down.
Who can say—what ſº to go to—'tis too difficult by half;
Some are higher than the knee, some are lower than the calf.
*Tis the Ball! but, oh! how dreary 1–men and women don’t combine;
For, the latter to the former, are as one to ninety-nine.
Thinly scattered are the females, scorning custom's decent rules;
Dense the pack of men assembled, looking like a crowd of fools.
Well! 'tis well that 'tis a failure; had it more successful proved,
Perhaps the hateful Bloomer nuisance for a time had onwards moved.
Where’s the beauty in concealment of an ankle neatly turn'd?
Though they’re º in closely hiding legs that are as awkward spurn'd.
I remember one on Monday—heavily she moved about,
With a foot that might be taken for a martyr to the gout.
Yearning for the large excitement that a Bloomer Ball might yield,
Many thought, for some amusement, they might in it find a field;
And at night along the pavement, near the corner of the Square,
At each new alighting Bloomer, stood a noisy crowd to stare:
But the crowd was disappointed, seeing what it witnessed then;
Scarcely half-a-dozen Bloomers, nearly seven hundred men.
Men the Guardsmen, men the idlers, men with nought on earth to do,
But to seek, and dearly pay for, anything on earth that’s new.
As I stepped into the ball-room, far as any eye could see,
Saw the crowd of men on town, closely pack'd as close could be;
Saw the patent leather-boots—saw the coat with well-cut tail—
Saw the Gibus hats, white chokers, and the embroider'dshirt of male.
Heard the rooms all filled with shouting, and there rose a mocking cheer,
When that rarily, a Bloºmer, 'mongst them happened º appear.
--
Not in vain the Bloomer movement... Forward! forward, let us range!
Set the world of fashion spinning—all improvement, comes from change.
*Twixt the two extremes of folly common sense is always found,
Howsoever these things be, I shall leave the Bloomer Ball:
Not for me the promised supper—hence with i. tarts, and all.
Comes an odour up a staircase—savouring of low-priced wine;
Let it make another's headache, for it shall not fuddle mine.
Let it fall, the Bloomer Ball—never was a thing so slow.
Now the gents are getting noisy-cheering, hooting-off Igo!

THE LEADER OF A FRENCH NEWSPAPER.
FRENch Editors (if there is such a thing as a French Editor still exist-
ing—out of prison) are puzzled to know what to write about. If they
write about politics, their paper is sure to be confiscated, if those
politics are not exactly to the taste of the President. Still their paper
must be filled—and, to avoid imprisonment, and at the same time fill
their columns with something, it is not unusual to meet with a Leader
like the following, dressed in all the honours of the largest type:
“WHAT WILL BECOME OF FRANCE2
“We have asked—and asked—until we are tired of asking.
“Where's the use of asking, if you never get a reply?.
“Echo would answer ‘Where’—only she has got the influenza.
“Yesterday there was a new moon,
“Do you think the Hedgehog is happy, because he hasn't to shave
every morning?
“Hark! what fearful cry was that?..... - -
“It was the cry of ‘Marchand d'Habi-i-i-its”—but the Seine will not
contain one dead cat the less for that to-morrow!
“Of all the Mysteries of Paris, SAusAGEs are the greatest!!!
“We could weep, only onions are too dear.
*Twice happy is the man who can cut his own hair! -
“The sun will rise to-morrow, and rise the day after that, and per-
haps the day after that, and yet the Government will not dare to lay
hands upon him for inciting the people to Rise!
“And yet upwards of thirty carrots were pulled up Wººterday by a
Garde Champêtre upon the plea of their º Rogges!!!!
“Foreigners may have several complaints that lie at their doors, but
none can lie so much as a French Porter. -
“Two and two make ſour—and we hope the Procureur-General will
not prosecute us for saying so—for really we know no better. -
“Revolutions are the madness of many Frenchmen, for the gain of
very few. - - -
“Write a political article in haste, and repent in prison at leisure.
“It is rarely you see a married couple, both of whom squint.
“Brew your quarrels at home, if you like, but do not expect every
one who calls to partake of them. - - - -
“A man's choicest thoughts are lost in his mightcap; . .
“Mahomet's paradise is imperfect; there are no beds in it!
“Christmas comes but once a year! -
“Still it is most difficult to say—and we must again repeat our
question, which ends our Leader-

PROGRESS OF BLOOMERISM.
UNCH has been informed by a
gunsmith that some ladies,
attired in the Bloomer dress,
called at his shop, and asked to
see some caps.
The Bloomer costume facili-
tating walking very much, it is
in contemplation that young
ladies assuming it, shall walk
into various situations hitherto
appropriated to the harder sex.
We understand that a banker
has been favoured with a cir-
cular, inviting him to take
Bloomer clerks. Bloomers talk
also of demanding admittance
to the Church and the Bar; but
probably they would be kept
out of these professions by
their own objection to the
gown.
A young, smart, active
Bloomer, with a character from
her last place—a lady's maid
—wants a situation as a
tigress.
H. M. S. “PRINCE OF WALES.”
AMong the documents from which we extracted lately, belonging
to this vessel, were found the following letters. They appear to have
formed part of a kind of hostile correspondence, arising from a dis-
agreement between ADMIRAL BENBow #". and one of his officers.
We are given to understand that they illustrate with some clearness
the nature of those disturbances which lead to the courts martial not
unfrequent in HER MAJESTY's service.
No. 1.
“Sir, H. M. S. Prince of Wales, Serpentine.
“I have the honour to call your attention to the fact that,
when the hands were on deck this morning, you used, in relation to
myself, while duty was going on, the words “Son of a Sea-cook.' I
beg to ask you whether you intended by the epithet in question to
detract from my reputation as an officer and a gentleman?
“I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,
“To ADMIRAL BENBow HAzY. GRIMLY Spoon, Lieutenant.”
No. 2.
“Sir, H. M. S. Prince of Wales, Serpentine.
“I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter,
on HER MAJESTY's service, of yesterday's date.
“Nothing more tends to promote insubordination in one of HER
MAJESTY's ships than the custom of complaint by inferior officers of the
language of their superiors.
“If you wish it, I will communicate to their Lordships your dis-
satisfaction with your Admiral's conduct, in order that their Lordships
may give you an opportunity of causing a Court of Inquiry to be held to
investigate the circumstances.
“I am, Sir, your obedient Servant,
“To LIEUT. GRIMLY SPOON. BENBow HAzy, Admiral.”
No. 3.
“Sir, I cannot consider your explanation with reference to the
epithet, ‘Son of a Sea-cook,” satisfactory under the circumstances. I
feel sure that, upon further reflection, you will see the propriety of
modifying the offensive expression. Otherwise I must request you to
forward copies of this correspondence to their Lordships of the
Admiralty, that they may act in the matter as they see fit.
“Your obedient Servant,
“To ADMIRAL BENBow HAzY. GRIMLY Spoon, Lieutenant.”
No. 4.
(Letter from Admiral, acknowledging receipt.)
No. 5.
(Letter from Lieutenant, calling attention.)
No. 6.
(Letter from Admiral to Admiralty.)
No. 7.
(Admiralty to Admiral.)
No. 8.
(Admiralty to Lieutenant.)
No. 9. -
(Lieutenant to Admiralty.)
No. 10.
(Admiralty to Crown Lawyer, on the meaning of the “epithet.”)
No. 11.
(Crown Lawyer's “Opinion ” on “Son of Sea-cook.”)
No. 12.
(Admiralty to Admiral, recommending an “arrangement.”)
No. 13.
“Sir, H.M.S. Prince of Wales, Serpentine.
“I have to communicate to you, with regard to the subject of
our correspondence, that in using the epithet, ‘Son of a Sea-cook, I
had no wish to detract from your family, nor to imply that you were
incapable of discharging other duties than those which devolve upon
sea-cooks generally. I am sorry that your warmth should have led to a
controversy disturbing the harmony hitherto prevalent on board H.M.S.
Prince of Males.
“Your obedient Servant,
“To LIEUT. GRIMLY SPOON.” BENBow HAzy, Admiral.”
No. 14.
“Sir, H.M.S. Prince of Wales, Serpentine.
“I beg to express my satisfaction at the fact, that your
epithet, ‘Son of a Sea-cook,” was not intended to depreciate me
personally or professionally.
“Your obedient Servant,
“To ADMIRAL BENBow HAzy. GRIMLY Spoon.”
So the affair appears to have terminated amicably; and, indeed,
ADMIRAL BENBow Hazy expressed himself gratified with the result,
at the dinner-table of SIR — —, K.C.B., when the affair was last
mentioned. We believe that the full state of the actice list has, how-
ever, precented their Lordships from again employing LIEUTENANT
GRIMLY Spoon afloat.
*...* We have made several inquiries ourselves, on the origin and
real meaning of the epithet in question; but we have been unable to
learn why a “sea-cook” is more contemptible than other cooks, and
has any peculiar degradation which can be supposed to attach to his
É.i MR. Spoon, we believe, is from a branch of the Spoons of
amish, in Suffolk.
GRAND PROTECTIONIST GOOSE CLUB.
IN consequence of the great success of the Goose Clubs, which are
prevalent at the present season of the year, it is in contemplation by
the country party to establish a Wild-Goose Club, for the exclusive use
of the Protectionists. One of the main objects of the club will be the
getting up of a grand wild-goose chase atter Protection during the
ensuing session of Parliament. The wild-goose chase will call into
requisition several of the old Parliamentary hacks, and fine sport is
expected. In order to give as much variety as possible to the attrac-
tions of the Wild-Goose Club, many of the members of the country
party are prepared to go upon any number of wild-goose errands. The
promoters of the club are in treaty for an extensive mare's-nest, where
the process of hatching the requisite number of Wild Geese may be
conducted. The Wild Geese will be fed upon Wild Oats, sown by an
insane farmer, driven out of his mind by the repeal of the Corn Laws.
Measures will be taken to secure the well-known bird in hand with the
celebrated two in a bush—the search after which will, it is expected,
turn out to be a most exhilarating wild-goose errand.
Further particulars will be duly announced ; and in the meantime all
§: may be addressed to Goosey Goosey GANDER, Esq., Old Bond
treet.
SOMETHING LIKE A MIRACLE.
THE following wonderful passage occurs in an account of a prize-
fight, given by a sporting contemporary. . It may be premised that one
of the combatants had his jaw broken. At round

by Smith on the left ear, and Stevens went down. 5. Stevens hit out with his left,
catching Smith above the left eye, which bled freely.

closed for the fall; both down. STEvens under. 7. The men all alive.”
All alive / Well, really that, does, seem rather extraordinary. , All
alive, after, such a pommelling ! Who shall say that miracles have
ceased ?. The actual bruisers may yie with the legendary confessors
who walked with their heads off, and, we believe, (with a slight mental
reservation) came together, and came to, after having been cut into
little bits. Nevertheless, two fellows beating each other to §.
although they should remain all alive, form a not very creditable

FUNNY MARKET AND WITTY INTELLIGENCE.
NotwitHSTANDING the im-
º: in the funds of
humour, which we have re-
cently noticed, they made a
- further advance in conse-
quence of a large transac-
tion in stock jokes, sup-
posed to have been made in
anticipation of the Christ-
mas pantomimes. The
burlesque writers have not
yet begun to operate; but
when they do commence,
the better sort of puns
will go rapidly up; but it
is expected they will go
down—with the audiences
—at about Christmas time.
A gloomy feeling
was caused by the
rumour of the fail-
: ure of one of the
oldest jokers in the
City. The fact is,
that the trade has
been for some time
= thoroughly inun-
== †. #:
- - - Y and he has long been
*_ == \ º dealing in accom-
modation jokes, got
up between himself and another, whose name we will not at present
mention. Their dealings were almost entirely in chaff, and the Millers
—Joe—and company, into whose books they had gone very deeply—
will be the chief sufferers.
There was an arrival to-day of conundrums and other dry goods, speci-
mens of which were handed about rather freely. Several parcels were
consigned to the Punch Office, but few are above the average. The fol-
lowing are the best quotations:–
“If figs are sold at sixpence a pound by the ‘drum,” how should
they be º by the trumpet?”
“If £8 per ton is the price of lead in sheets, what would it be worth
in quires?”
|
The market was well supplied with small yarn, some of which was
about equal to the following:-
“An individual says that the following translation struck him (it
would have served him right had it knocked him down) during a three-
hours' journey from Kensington to the City:-Nemo omnibus horis sapit,
No one knows the times of an omnibus.”
There has been a perfect glut of the lower quality of stuffs, which
are offered at any price, but the dealers would have nothing to do with
them. The following will suffice to show the kind of article that some
unprincipled persons, trading on such capital as may be, found in the
j are desirous of foisting on the community. “How,” asks
one of these unprincipled adventurers, in a recent circular, “How can
you express in four units that food is necessary for man?-l. 0.2, 8.
One—ought—to–eat,” is the º he hazards. We are not sure that
an indictment for trying to get funny under false pretences would not
lie against the person, thus committing himself; or, at all events, for
passing a counterfeit joke, as the following goes to show a second case
of uttering.
“Why is a conspiracy like a chicken walking?—Because it’s a
fowl proceeding !”
There can be no doubt that the person capable of hatching a thing
of this sort deserves to be completely beaten up with eggs in the
nearest pillory.
There lºſiºn no packet from the Isle of Dogs when we went, to
press; and a funny dog we had expected from that quarter has
accordingly not arrived.
The following has just been growled out to us by a ſunny dog of our
own, who, with his MS., has been committed at once to the kennel.
(h “Why is a bald man like an invalid?–Because he wants fresh
)air.”
After this it will be º to keep the reader any longer in the
oppressive atmosphere of the Funny Market, and we accordingly
release him from his painful position.
An OLD PRovePB IMPROVED.—A Wink is as good as a Nod to a
Blind Auctioneer.
“THE FIVE NIGHTS OF ST. ALBANS.”
We remember, though very hazily indeed, that years ago, a romance
of the above name, exercised a most awful power over our young
imagination. The effect, if we remember right, was in a great measure
produced by the mysterious lighting up of the old Abbey, night after
night of the “five” which were the subjects of the tale. How it was
lighted; what went on there; what would come of it; all these specu.
lations kept us in a haze of mysterious wonder, scarcely dispelled
altogether by the birch which rudely woke us from the dieam when
we happened to indulge in its fascination “during school-hours.”
Now that we are come, however, to mature years, we clearly perceive
that there exists in the St. Albans of to-day the materials for an equally
stirring romance. The commission ºf there affords the subject:
and as for the “five nights;” five nights, there, at least, were recently
occupied in proceedings of a character as secret and as interesting as
ever were the materials of romance or novel yet. . A novelist ought to
take up the notion, and he would find that it would lead him quite out
# tº: common track (including the (Mrs.) Radcliffe Highway) of
culon.
Of course there would have to be a love story for basis. Young
DINDAMoNT is devotedly attached to ADELINDA; has courage, con-
stancy, &c.—everything but money. ADELINDA's parent, SIXANAITO
(of noble Italian origin), is an electioneering solicitor, who sternly
forbids the union. , Loyers are in, despair. ... DINDAMont soliloquising
near the Abbey, and, being told to “move on,” suddenly observes strange
lights in a house. Lover enters; is knocked down and hustled out.
Grief of ADELINDA. This would occupy one night.
The second night arrives. DINDAMONT steals off to watch the strange
house again. Dark figure *:::::: in cloak-moonlight ad lib., of
course. DINDAMoNT nears him; packet falls from stranger's hand.
Ha! the gleam of gold ! - --
The third night SixANAIto (in disguise) steals to DINDAMONT:
takes him off with him to strange house. Groups, wax-lights, mysterious
packages, &c., “Dost thou vote?” And the youth, raising his eyes
to heaven, replied, “Yes!”
Some light comic business about the beer of the populace, and the
“merrie jests” of the “host” of the Keys, might lead gradually up
to the proceedings of the fourth night. DINDAMONT happens (any-
thing “happens,” you know, in novels) to be the dangerous witness
against SIXANAito by the machinations of DELTREM-opposing solicitor
and rival. Banquet. Proposed flight. Passionate scene between
SIXANAITO, DINDAMONT, and ADELINDA.
And, on the fifth night, Dispºſost and ADeLINDA, who have been
married in, the morning, fly off with SIXANAIto's blessing, and some
help from the “Sitting Member” to pass the honeymoon at Boulogne.
Whoever, means to take this subject, in hand had better be quick
about it. For, as part of the interest will be political, it will be as well
to bring out the book, while the Borough of St. Albans has still a
political existence,—which won't be long !

THE Globe says that SiR JAMEs CLARK has called at Eaton Place—

to avail himself thereof. The country will appreciate the kindness as well as delicacy
which suggested this visit, not without its significance.”
SIR JAMEs CLARK, the man whose healing fingers are wont to encircle
the wrist of QUEEN VICTORIA! Truly, there is significancy in such a
visit. And yet Kossuth might, we dare say, have royal physicians in
plenty, if he cared to take their prescriptions. Can we doubt, for
instance, that Russia would refuse him a doctor; or that the EMPEROR
of Austria—the Hungarians’ “beardless NERo "–would fail to send

MR, MOLONY ON THE POSITION OF THE

(To the Editors of Newspapers in general.)
TR,--THE Times newspaper,

men. I am one of these—a

so nearly. . . But yesterday, as with a heaving breast and an eye
flashing with indignation, Í commented upon the statement of the
Law Review and the Times, that an Attorney had settled a practice
to the amount of a thousand a-year upon his daughter, the wife of a
Barrister—WIGGINs, of the Western Circuit, a flippant member of the
mess, with the heartlessness which characterises him, said, ‘I recom-
mend you, MoLONY, my boy, to see if the Attorney has got any
more daughters to marry.’ And he added, that he himself intended
to take lodgings in Bedford Row, and create an early interest
in the girls’ minds, by giving lollipops to the Attorneys’ children as they
went out to walk. Other remarks of a similar nature were made.
MR. HUGsoN's name was mentioned amongst others, who has thrown
over a young lady who was tenderly attached to him, for the purpose of
marrying a young lady who has a large Old Bailey connection.
“Sir—these remarks sickened me. I come of a race that holds honour
Sacred, and likes not to jest with Sacred thin That the Attorney
may be cast back into the perdition from which the reptile sprung—that
that livid and low-born wretch shall no longer interpose between the
º Barrister and the distressed public, is the wish and hope of
my heart.
“Cast away this intermeddler, and a new era commences for a profes-
sion. Talent henceforth speaks for itself. Parties interested in litiga-
tion are therefore interested in selecting their own Counsel. That an
Attorney's wife should be his mother-in-law, is no longer considered to
be a requisite part of the education of a Barrister-at-Law. The pro-
fession is to oe relieved from that incubus; and walks forth in its high
mission, erect and free.
“Except upon terms of hostility, I, for one, declare upon my honour,
I have never had dealings with an Attorney. I have known such men
but as the extortionate agents of unscrupulous tradesmen. Rather
than receive the emissaries of Attorneys, the writs of Attorneys, I have
quitted my chambers for the country, or the apartments of a friend, or
1 have simulated absence, and closed my door.
“In court, and on circuit, I have preserved the same independent
line of conduct. I have passed i.e. across the table to other men.
I myself was too proud to have dealings with persons belonging to the
lower branch of a profession which is at once the noblest and the most
debasing in existence.
“In the country where I first drew breath, and over, which my
ancestors reigned sovereign—in the green land of my fathers—(need I
name thee, my º my beloved, my persecuted Ireland?)–
Attorneys have been shot, have been hustled, have been ducked to
death. My dying sire left me scarce any other legacy than hereditary
enmity to that race. In my heart of hearts I cherish that hatred: in
my bosom's depths I nourish that holy and unquenchable flame.
Attorneys tº ruin upon me and mine. Vampires! how long have
they fattened on the red blood of the noble and the bravel A coward,
skulking, and in disguise, a janissary of a firm in Dublin, penetrated my
grandsire's hall, and served a writ on the unsuspecting old man. Ruin
followed on his ruthless footstep. The halls are desolate now, where
the great feasted, and the poor found shelter. The Attorney passed
over our threshold, and the child of kings was a beggar. There is a
grass-grown ruin in Connemara—there is a quenched hearthstone
among the weeds there—where the fires of princes smoked for a
thousand years. In a lonely chamber, in London, their descendant
lººsans fortune. Something tells him that she will visit
the Exile !
“The time has come, then, when the Attorney may be dashed aside,
and the Barrister may present himself with open breast to the world.
I am †". I am here. Men of England, seek ye redress? Here is
one will help ye. Unfortunate, i ye, a Champion? Oppressed,
need ye eloquence to aid your cause ? Orphans, are ye deprived of
tour rights? Mothers, wives, children! tremble ye for the fate of so
j father, pursued by vindictiveness? ere is one that wi
shelter ye in his immaculate robe, while he does battle with the yelling
hell-hounds of the law
“My written style is feeble in comparison with my spoken eloquence;
the torrents of my native mountains are not more impetuous than the
cascades of my oratory. Rainbows play around theirirresistible flow—
they fructify as they roll. I adorn, every subject which I touch. I
have a mind enriched with classic lore, and with native tradition. I
wait. I am ready. I am here.
| “I beg to announce that I shall beat home for consultation atm
| chambers, 5, Gutter Court, Temple, fourth floor—from nineo'clock till
eleven every morning: and in the evenings after the Courts of West-
minster are closed. - -
“As I have never yet received the visits of any Attorney, the public may
have confidence in me; and I shall be happy to give advice and take
fees DIRECTLY, and without the intervention of the middle man, so
ruinous alike to counsel and client. - -
“My staircase is proverbially easy of ascent, and occasionally lighted
at night. My sitting-room is airy. A bench for clients will be found
in the passage, and gentlemen coming on business connected with the
Old Bailey will be treated privately in my clerk's room, by one who
hopes the public will soon better know the name of
“Temple, Nov. 7. THADDEUs MoLoNY.”
AN ELYSIAN TEA PARTY.
IN bright Elysian bowers a troop of dames,
Such, first of GEORGES, as thine era claims,
As still their custom, blest as sprites can be,
Met to partake in tattle and in tea.
A purer Hyson scatters fragrance round;
With choicer China stands the table crown'd;
A sleeker Cat is purring on the rug;
Upon the sofa snores a fatter Pug;
More hideous Idols goggle on the shelf,
And tea is handed by a blacker Elf.
Oh, happy they, in that delightful place,
With endless cards and everlasting lace,
Unfading silks, and charms that never droop,
And all the ſº of the train and hoop, -
Where, fixed for ever in their proper sphere
They’re more at home than ever they were here.
“What news from Earth : * BELINDA first began;
“What's the last folly of that monster, Man?”—
“Not Man's,” fair CELIA said, “the last new freak.”—
“indeed! What is 'if' cried Chios. "Prithee, speak!”—
“A revolution”—“I supposed no less,”
PHYLLIs exclaim’d—“has broken out in—dress.
A Colonel's Colonel, Fashion's law defies,
And lifts the name of BloomER to the skies.
A hat, like some .. mushroom, shades
The head, whose locks are bound in closest braids;
A light surtout invests the female beau
“Gracious !” cried DAPHNE; CYNTHIA murmured, “Oh!”—
“The flowing form no stays coercive bind;
No tasteful art sets off the form behind.
Scarce to the knee the tunic’s skirt descends,
And the attire—in short—in trousers ends.”—
“The strife is won at last !” sharp BRIDGET cries,
“And woman gains the long-disputed prize.”—
“Nay,” replies sage CLARIssa, “child, not so!
Ne'er to those—things—the sex will influence owe;
Still let them keep—if they’d retain their sway—
Those flowing robes, that most mankind obey.
Power's empty badges leave the men to bear;
Nor, save in figure, what-d'ye-call-'ems wear.
But see, here comes SIR PLUME's conceited ghost:
CAESAR!—my fan, and more ambrosia-toast!”
Sporting, British and Foreign.
THE Sun reports that—
“The long-talked-of fight between Lord H. 's two owls—Iron Beak and Foung,
and twelve rats—came off at midnight, on the 27th of October, in the drawing-room
of the Jockey Club.”
Is not the venue of this transaction a misnomer, as the lawyers say?
Drawing-room Should it not have been Badger-drawing-room?

'Twas at the civic feast, on having won
he chair of WHITTINGTON,
Aloft, in lordly state,
The worthy HUNTER sate
On his official throne.
The Ministers were placed around;
Their minds to capon and to turtle bound:—
So should desert in Whigs be crown'd.
The plucky PREMIER near his side
Sat, who the Pope of Roºſe defied,
When he the HAT on England tried.
Happy, happy, happy MAYoſt'
None but a trump,
None but a trump,
None but a trump deserves the fare.
Musicians, placed on high,
Lest waiting guests should tire,
With soothing airs allay’d desire;
*Till fragrant fumes ascend the sky,
And rapturous thoughts inspire.
The feast began—by Jovel—
With soup that might be rank’d above
Ambrosia, which the Immortals love.
The turtle's shapeless form supplied the prog,
Sublime repast of MAGog and of Gog.
The banquet was by Burrell drest:
Two hundred and a half tureens—enough to
feast a world!
The serving men quick hand the plates
around,
And sighs of ecstacy and smacking lips
resound.
With heedless ears,
Each gourmand hears,
THE GUILDHALL FEAST; or, ODEON LORD MAYOR'S DAY.

Seems deaf as clod,

If question interferes.
The rites of HARKER now 'tis fitting should be

Of HARKER ever jolly, never sprung.
Lo! with the loving-cup he comes;
Twang the trumpets, thump the drums.
Now sip the spicy bowl; he comes! he comes:
HARREB, jolly, but ne'er sprung,
Over civic toasts doth reign.
HARKER's richness is a treasure;
Drinking is the City’s pleasure;
Fine the treasure,
Wast the pleasure,
Patriotic cups to drain.
Here, long ago,
Ere yet iced punch had learned to flow,
While pines were unknown fruit;
The Aldermen, in antique suit
And quaint attire,
Their paunches lined with beef from oxen
cooked entire.
At last great FRANCATELLI came,
To renovate the human frame:
Refined gastronomer, whose precious lore,
Enlarging ancient cookery's bounds,
New notions constantly propounds
Of kickshaws, and tit-bits, and plates unknown
before.
If BURRELL will not yield the prize,
Let both contest the crown,
And, while his best each artist tries,
Let Punch to judge sit down.

IN ANSWER to NUMEROUS INQUIRIES, we ARE HAPPY TO SAY, THAT MR. BRIGGs Is QUITE well, AND At BRIGhton. He Is TAKING
THE oppoRTUNITY to GIVE HIs FAMILY A Few RIDING LEssons.
IN A DAY OR Two.
WE shouldn't wonDER IF He went out witH THE HARRIERs
|ST. COPPOCK AND ST. ALBANS.
If the revelations made to the Commission inquiring into the ſº
of election in the case of BELL and CARDEN disgust a clean mind wit
the foulness of the borough of St. Albans; at least ºthere is a com-
pensating comfort in the “horror” of the “solicitor and parliamentary
agent,” St. CoPPock. Soothing, and beautiful, amidst matters of
irritation and disgust, was the evidence of our SAINT (Punch cannot
but canonize him while yet in the flesh) JAMEs Coprock.
ST. CoPPock said:— º
“If, instead of going through the register of voters, as Edwards had done, marking
the name of everyone who sold his vote, he were to go through the list of British
boroughs returning members to Parliament, beginning with Abingdon and ending
with Stafford, and if he were to put opposite the names of the respective members,
‘bought his seat," he should make a more extraordinary disclosure than that of Ma.
EdwahDs himself.”
St. STEPHEN must have held his nose at this denounced corruption
of his children. But what follows is sustaining from its beauty, its
generous frankness. Here CoPPoCK expands into the saint, with the
‘melodious twang” of AUBREY’s departing sprite:
“He stated this, to show the system, of which no man had a greater horror in the
kingdom than himself.”
How wholesome comes St. Coprock's horror upon us—what a note
of melody, and whiff of violets from amidst the money-changing corrup-
tionists of St. Albans ! We tie a few flowers together, culled from St.
CoPPock—sanctified as he is by his horror:
“22500 was to be forthcoming provided MR. BELL stood, and witness had heard that
£1500 was SIB RoeraT CARDEN's limit. The third party it, the borough wanted a can-
didate simply for the expenditure. The principle of "bleed and bribe' had always
been the ruling principle. . . . . Never had anything to do with the arrangement
or disposition of the money in these matters, and derived no advantage but a poli-
tical one.'
Great is the capacity of the “but”—the political “but.” No money
down; but the future comprehensive “but; ” as appears further on :-
“It was not unusual with him on similar occasions to recommend to Government
appointments, or to post people in his own office, on the principle of serving those who
had served him.”
St. Coppock, surviving his “horror” at bribery and corruption, to
reciprocate services bestowed!
“When SIR. H. G. WARD stood for St. Albans, it cost him £2400. When he stood
for Sheffield, containing some thousands in population, it only cost him £150.”
And here comes the remedy:—
“You cannot," said THE WITNEss, EMPHATICALLY, “PREvexr This species of
ExPENDITURE, UNTIL You Allow THE BALLor, which would BE THE only PRR-
wkNTIve. AGAINST Baibeh Y."
MR. CoPPock has, it appears, been in practice as a parliamentary
agent, for twenty years; º all the time in a condition of horror at the
wickedness, the human baseness, he has been doomed, by his fees, to
entertain. For twenty years he has handled pitch, suffering twenty
years' horror at the defilement! Wonderful is the self-adaptability of
the human animal to circumstance. Men have entered ovens with
shoulders-of-mutton, and sucking pigs; coming out alive and ".
though perspiring somewhat, with the mutton deliciously browned, an
the pig in a complete armour of crackling.
SIR John MALcol M speaks of a man whose daily diet was a certain
allowance of corrosive sublimate; and the man ate, drank, and was
merry. . And it now appears that, albeit horror may turn hair white
“in a single night,”—it may become nutriment to a man (especially if
spiced and seasoned with a political “but") for twenty years. What
seem the rigours of ST. STYLITEs on his desert pillar—to St. CoPPock
on the midnight bolster? What the anguish of the self-inflicted
scourge to the poignant recollections of human baseness! And yet man
(especially when a parliamentary agent) may be brought to flourish upon
º, turning it by the alchemy of custom into gold—to sovereign
gold.
The Crowns of Hungary and Austria.
It has been asked, “Where is the Crown of St. Stephen?” Punch
is unable to say where: but of this, Punch is certain. Wherever it
may be, it is far better of than the Crown, of Austria; for that (at
present) is on the head of a perjurer, named FRANCIS-Joseph.

BLOOMERISM.
A LATTER-DAY FRAGMENT. BY THOMAs SNARLYLE.
A MAn world this, my friends, a
world in its lunes, petty and
other; in lunes other than petty
now for some time; in petty-
lumes, pettilettes, or
pantalettes, about
these six weeks, ever
since when this ram-
Fº androgynous
loomerism first
came over from
Yankee land. A sort
of shemale dress you
call Bloomerism; a
fashion of SistER
JoNATHAN's. Trou-
sers tight at ankles,
and for most part
frilled ; tunic de-
scending with some
= degree of brevity,
- perhaps to knees,
*scending to throat and open at chemisette-front, or, buttoned there;
*ollar down-turned over neckerchief; and, crowning all, broad-brimmed
hat; said garments severally feathered, trimmed, ribboned, variegated
according to the fancies and the vanities: these, chiefly, are the outward
differences between Bloomer dress and customary feminine Old Clothes.
Not much unlike nursery-uniform you think this description of costume,
but rather considerably like it, I compute. “To me,” writes GLUMM,
in his own rough way, “these, Bloomers seem to resemble, in great
measure, overgrown schoolgirls, kept backwards, as they say, by
i. Mamma, at a ‘Preparatory Establishment for Young Ladies.’
see nothing at all admirable in them, for my part, but much not to
be admired on any account, and look upon them, at the best, as mere
strapping hoydens and audacious unfeminine tomboys.”. , Nor will you
most likely, more than GLUMM, discern aught laudable in external
Bloomerism: a masquerade frippery: an excrescence of the conceits
and the coquetries. Invisible are the merits of the Bloomer, dress,
such as it has. A praiseworthy point in Bloomerism the emancipation
of the ribs: an exceeding good riddance the deliverance from corset,
trammelling genteel thorax, with springs of steel and whalebone,
screwing in waist to Death's hour-glass contraction, and squeezing
lungs, liver, and midriff into an unutterable cram. Commendable, too,
the renouncement of sous-jupe bouffante, or ineffable wadding, invented,
I suppose, by some Hottentot to improve female contour after the type
of VENUs, his fatherland's, and not Cythera's. . Wholesome, moreover,
and convenient, the abbreviation of trains, serving in customary female
Qld Clothes the purpose of besom, and no other: real improvements,
doubtless, these abandonments of ruinous shams, ridiculous unveracities,
and idolatries of indescribable mud-Pythons. But Bloomerist inex:
pressible affectations, and mimicries of masculine garments, nether and
. such, my friends, I take to be no more than dumb, inarticulate
clamourings for the Rights of Women, GEORGE SAND phantasms, and
mutinous female radicalisms grown termagant and transcendent. The
last, new madness is this Bloomerism: the latest species of insanity
º from time to time: Puseyism having been the mania before
that. Disputes about surplices in pulpit, and albs elsewhere, give place
to controversies in theatres and lecture-halls concerning petty lunes
and frilled trousers; paraphermalia, however, not less important than
canonicals, as I judge, for one. Better, I say, MRs. Bloomer in her
petty, lunes, than the Rev. Aloysius QUIDDLEPOPE in dalmatic and
chasuble. But here are we, my friends, in this, mad world, amid the
hallooings and bawlings, and guffaws and imbecile simperings and
titterings, blinded by the November smokefog of coxcombries and
vanities, stunned by the perpetual hallelujahs of flunkeys, beset by
maniacs and simpletons in the great lunes and the petty lunes; here, I
say, do we, with Bloomerism beneath us bubbling uppermost, stand,
hopelessly upturning our eyes for the daylight of heaven, upon the
;: ºf a vexed unfathomable gulf of apehood and asshood simmering
orever! I
Not exactly the Man of a few Words.
Louis NAPOLEoN has just delivered a little Message to the Assembly
—only five columns long. Louis NAPOLEON's Messages run to that
extraordinary length, we should like to know the extent of one of his
conversations. Perhaps it is for this purpose that he is anxious to get
the term of his office extended; for he wishes to “say a few words” to
the French nation; but he finds that three years are by far too brief a
period to say anything in beyond a Message. Elect him for life, and
then he’ll speak his mind!
KNIGHTSBRIDGE BARRACKS-BROMPTON
KITCHENS.
“MR. PUNCH, Front Kitchen, No. —, Brompton Crescin.
“I write to you as one who won't see poor women put
upon (there's three of us, ELIZA, the under-housemaid, MARTHA, the
cook, and me here, at No. —, Brompton Crescin)—I write to you for
help against the wicked hardheartedness of the Times, newspaper,
with which, amongst the screams of all on us, the knife-boy joining,
cook all alight singed a goose yesterday. It’s about the removing of
the Knightsbridge Barracks out of London (well known to be the
brightest jewel in HER MAJESTY's Crown) * knows, where, to
Blackheath or Hounslow. And what for? Why, that a place may be
built—a sort of one shilling gallery—for pictures: stupid, unfeeling
things, with no flesh or .#in 'em—or, if there’s anything like it, not
always what it ought to be, and what wouldn’t be hung up in many
decent families I’ve lived in.
“Do away with the Barracks for picturs! As if there could be such
a picturas them bullworks of their country—the Guards; both Blues
and Reds! Well, if my blood don't fairly wobble, when I think that
him, as I won't mention—(six feet three in his blessed stockings, with a
colour like a rose, and moustarchers soft as any mouse's back)—and to
think that him and such as him should be sent away to make room for
what I’m told is nothing but canvas and booge, with ultra-marines;
which, whatever they may be, ain’t fit to i. the boots of the Guards;
—why, to think of it—but never!
“I don’t write this without knowing what I’m about. I’ve been all
round the Crescin, and there isn't a maid in the place-not so much as
one—for they’re all of a mind; and they say, if the barracks is to be
removed, and the dear soldiers sent into country quarters—there isn't
a servant that won't give warning, unless railway expenses is allowed
her in her wages, and her days out more than doubled.
“Fine Arts, I hear they call’em. Well, I’m sure! As if all the
Arts in the world—as fine as they might be-could ever come up to the
sweet, sweet Blues; for why should I hide it—that is NBY’s
regimen?
“You will, therefore, Mr. Punch, give warning that if the Barracks
is removed, the streets that embraces them—as far as housemaids is
concerned—will be a howling wilderness. Me, ELIZA, and Cook are
all of a mind; and if they move the barracks, are, to a woman, ready
with our boxes, to move with the first blast of the trumpet. I am,
“Your humble servant, Mr. Punch, to command,

singe with half-a-dozen Timeses to-night: HENRY, and 'Gustus, and
CHARLIE (this is 'tween us) is a comin!”
CARLYLE ON NOBILITY.
MR. CARLYLE says, in his recently-published Life of John STERLING,
that if asked how a noble life is to be led, the heart's answer will be,
“Nonsense! Noble life is in Drury Lane, and wears yellow boots.””
We can fancy some ºff". adopting this idea, and making

In :-
N OBILITY FOR THE MILLION |
Those who wish to walk in the footsteps of Nobility, should hasten to the
GOLDEN BOOT, NEAR DRURY LANE,
And supply themselves immediately with a pair of our Eight-and-Sixpennies.
According to CARLYle, the Golden Boot, NEAR DRURY Lane, is the only
way to a noble life.
*...* Copy the Address!—Come Early/
We certainly were not aware that there was any particular virtue in a
boot or a shoe; but perhaps MR. CARLYLE may recognise about the
foot that peculiar nobility of sole which he may regard as the Sola
Nobilitas. ...We may certainly look to the boot for the stamp of the
man himself, but we should never have thought of seeking in it the
stamp of his character. But perhaps, after all, there is no more ready
tº: of ascertaining a man’s walkin life than by reference to his shoe
eather.
The Worst of British Bloomerism.
We do not feel much alarmed by the probability that BRITANNIA
will leave off her Petticoats; but the news from Caffre-land makes us
seriously apprehensive that she may give up her Cape. .

CHURCH BELLS AND THEIR USES.
BEAUTIFUL are church bells, with their melodious invita-
tions—their solemn farewells! And, doubtless, the bells of
St. Mary's, Cheltenham, are of most melodious metal; at
times most melodiously employed. Here is, at least, one
proof of their beautiful use:–
“EARL FitzHARDINGE arrived at his Cheltenham residence, German
Cottage, on Friday afternoon. On his Lordship's arrival being made
kuown, the bells of St. Mary's rang their customary peal of welcome.”
There can be no doubt that the noble Earl, so significantly
welcomed, brings with his customary visit, a huge accession
of all the household virtues to lucre-loathing Cheltenham.
Yes, the bells of St. Mary's do not cry, “Welcome, oh
Earl mighty of purse, to the shopkeepers and traders in
Mammon; but thrice welcome, oh chrysolite peer—and for
ever welcome the virtues in your train! Welcome, meek-
ness of heart—welcome, humility—welcome, bright example
—for all these are with EARL Fitzhak DINGE!’
When church bells can ring such a welcome, they bless

Popish Remedies for Irish Evils.
THE Irish “exodus” is still going on, and, concurrently
with it, two Irish subscriptions are going on also. The
Roman Catholic Prelates of Ireland are calling on their
flocks to subscribe, first, to a Catholic Defence Associa-
tion, and next, to a Catholic University. The Association,
we presume, is to defend, and the University to educate,
the Roman Catholics whom the said “exodus” is taking to
the other side of the Atlantic; as it seems likely that, in a
very short time, there will be none remaining; and the
depopulation of Ireland will probably be rather expedited
by the two subscriptions.

presence of mind has not been restored by the remarks of the crowd

idea what we’ve gone through—with the boys, and the horrid women,
and the low people; but she would ride on the box- - -
Miss Virginia M. Pasamaquoddy (with a voice pitched so high that it
scorns the ordinary way through the lips, and comes out a story higher,
through the nose). Ah!—now, Miss RUNT, ma'am, you will realise the
holy satisfaction of the early Christian Martyrs, ma'am. Don't you feel
it a great and holy privilege to suffer, for the good cause—for the
elevation of woman-moral, physical, and intellectual? -
[N.B.-Miss WIRGINIA. M., PAsAMAQUODDY insists on looking at
everything in a moral, physical, and intellectual point of view-
#: human nature to a hearth-broom. - -

PAsAMAQUODDY.
Miss Virginia M. Pasamaquoddy. And then, ma'am, you'll feel, the
genuine enthusiasm, which only comes from persecution, ma'am.
I never knew what it was to feel real earnest, for the great Abolitionist
É. till I was nearly tarred and feathered in Lynchville, Old
arolina.
The Er-Unprotected. There! you said America was such an enlightened
country, Miss RUNT, and that a woman might travel from one end of it
to the other—and you see one might be tarred and feathered!
Miss Virginia M. Pasamaquoddy. Do not misunderstand me, ma'am,
I am proud of my country. The United States is certainly the greatest
and most enlightened nation of the Qld or New World... But opinion
is free with us, ma'am; and when the people arises in the majesty of
its might, I calculate there ain't any law that dare resist 'em. And
they were all on the Anti-Abolition ticket in Lynchville, I escaped,
thanks to that remarkable woman and true heroine, Mrs. Asa F.
TITTLes; but the sainted INCREASE F. PEABODY was caught in a corn-
bunker, and the way they tarred and feathered him was a caution.

lecture. Miss VIRGINLA M. Pasamaquodpy will address the audience
first; and if Miss Runt will then oblige with a few words—

the Audience, in a speech of two hours and a half, in which, to use
her own words, “she feels a great deal of liberty,” and shows it by
reading several passages of BLAckstone, on the tenderness of
the law to women—giving an outline of the life of MRs. John F.
Davis, wife of John F. Davis, whose name is revered by every
lover of humanity, but unluckily not known in the Theatre—
proving, what nobody is inclined to deny, that fight lacing is a
bad thing, and that Elizabethan ruffs, hoops, short waists,
and gigot sleeves are ugly and ludicrous—demanding for
women equality of rights with men, in the social, physical, and
intellectual relations of life—and, in short, doing everything but
make out any good reason for ladies dressing themselves like
ballet dancers, and exposing themselves to ridicule and insult, at
from three-pence to a shilling a head, on the stage of a public
Theatre. Throughout the lecture, Miss WIRGINIA. M. Pasaya-
Quoddy shows an alarmingly keen sense of impropriety, and
every time the Audience laugh, begs that she may not be mis-
construed. She also exhibits throughout a most comfortable
conviction of her own superiority, and a magnanimous condescen-
sion to the weakness of the stronger sea. The Audience listen
with patience for some time, till, finding there is nothing to laugh
at, they gradually drop off, and Miss WIRGINIA. M. Pasa MA-
QU oppy closes her discourse to empty beaches.
What WE MAY SEE.
The Lakes of Killarmey.
THE Daily News tells us that the EARL of KENMARE is taking
measures, that if permitted, will make him the keeper of
“The Lakes of Killarney, to which the public cannot approach without the permis-
sion of a landlord, which of course may at any time be withheld.”
It is a great comfort that a Scotch Duke cannot hide the sun in his
bonnet, or an Irish Earl wrap the firmament in his cloak. Otherwise the
world would be as comfortless and as darkas—as their own selfish souls.

ELECTRIC LYING.
HE Cologne Gazette contained
a. º message,”
to the effect that, two
Vienna papers assured their
readers,
“That Lond PALMERston has
addressed a note of excuse to the
Austrian Government in the mat-
ter of the Kossuth mania, in
which he states that the agents
of the Government had no sort of
share in it, and promises to take
steps that the mania may reach
its limitas soon as possible.”
This is very like LoRD
PALMERston, as all who
have considered the noble
Lord's foreign policy will
concede; especially like the
man who so lately snubbed
the Neapolitan Ambassa-
dor in his modest request that the Foreign Secretary would forward to
English embassies copies of the Neapo-English pamphlet of CARLo
MACEARLANo._The Vienna papers, however, have not given all the
assurances of Loºp PALMERston. Punch is, of course, enabled to
reprint them, in the order in which they shot through the electric
wires, warming and delighting the heart of PRINCE SCHWARTZENBURG.
Here they are:-

“The faithful troops of HER MAJESTY are under arms at Horse

floor of Westminster Hall.

nothing before them but their hands; and on turning into
the Exchequer, in the hope of more activity, we discovered,
in addition to the Barons on the Bench, a barren void. The
of a life of indolence; and, the other day, were despatching
messengers right and left to hunt up business from the
other Courts. There was, in fact, a regular battue of the
legal preserves; but, though one or two very old birds of
juniors were turned out, they had no motion in them, and
could offer no sport.
. After some difficulty, a Q.C., was bagged; but he was not
instructed, and would not favour the great guns on the
bench with an elocutionary flight. To see four or five
venerable legal luminaries all of a row—the Chief occupied
in nothing, and the Puisnés helping their Chief—is a
melancholy spectacle of Judicial much-ado-about-nothing-
ness. If a solitary “compute" happens to drop in, the
judicial mind, famishing for want of fodder, flies to it with
all the alacrity of a starving crew at the last biscuit. There
is scarcely a bone of contention left from which the Judges
in Westminster Hall are enabled to pick a bit; and so
great is the dearth, that of even the smallest and most
insignificant bone they insist on getting at the marrow.
The bringing to bear of so much judicial power on a paltry
amount of work, reminds one of a team of noble dray-horses
harnessed to a child's toy, wagon. We have sometimes
wondered at the policy of keeping up a war establishment
of Judges in time of peace; for never was less fighting or
litigation in Westminster Hall; but we have come to the
conclusion that five Judges are still necessary in each Court,
to keep each other, company. As there is no public, no
acting bar, and no business, the only mode of keeping the
look of life about the Court is by a good strong corps of
Judges... It is true that the crew and the passengers have
|all left the ship; but the officers still cling to it, which is
all right enough. Though we hardly see the necessity for
filling up-particularly at a cost of five thousand a year
-every vacancy that arises in the command of an o
lete hull, which has got stuck in the mud, and is superseded
by lighter, cheaper, and faster-going vessels. ,

description of the Lord MAYor's hats, including his own three-cornered
affair, and the richly cocked castors of his flunkeys. From the latter
epend massive tassels of lace, and the postilion's cap is surmounted
with a huge stag, under which the poor fellow would be not unlikely to
stagger. We have no doubt that the splendid official hats will be
generally recognised as the most interesting part of the official heads
of the City. All round his Lordship's hat he wears a white feather, and
from the top of it rises a º: puts our humble goose-
quill out of countenance. The civic dignitaries usually favour the public
with descriptions of their livery cºats, waistcoats, and breeches, but
they have never been so condescending as to hold up their hats to the
admiration of the world through the medium of the newspapers. We
must confess that we never yet heard of such a very hatty Lord Mayor,
though we have frequently heard of a Hatti-Scheriff.

the Roman Pontiffs, are subjected
to the penalty of excommunication,
cut off as rotten branches from the
Church of God, and if they die in
that state, doomed to etermal per-
dition.”
Pray, MonsIGNOR PAUL CULLEN, does your Church condemn Freemasonry without knowing any-
thing about it? If not, how did said dº procure its information? Are Masonic secrets no
secrets in the Confessional? And what have you to say against Freemasonry, after all?
The Church of Rome can only excommunicate the Freemasons. It dismisses them with a hearty
curse, and, speaking in the person of CULLEN, sighs that it can do no more. Monsignor continues—
“It is a sad calamity that a system so pernicious in its effects, and so hostile to Christian charity, should be tolerated or
encouraged in any district.”

is accorded to men of all religions.
“At the Manchester Meeting in honour of Kossuth, the other day, MR. BRight thought proper to
make some remarks in approval of conduct grossly illiberal to individuals of my communion. He
is reported to have used these words—HIs MAJESTY of Austria being the Emperor alluded to :—
“This Emperor, with all his power, could not raise as much money in the London market as the humblest merchant in
Manchester. (Cheers.) And here he must say, one of the most magnanimous and generous acts of MR. Cobden's life was
to call a public meeting to denounce the system of foreign loans to carry on war. (Cheers.) In that one act he had done more
for freedom in England than if he had raised a regiment of horse, or had equipped a ship of war. (Cheers.)”
“Sir, denouncing the system of foreign loans to carry on war, is denouncing my creed. I hold
that I have a right to sell my money, no matter for what purpose, to anybody whomsoever. For the
matter of that, indeed, I have a right to sell myself; and I and my co-capitalists do virtually sell our-
selves to the divinity whom we worship; and, if we did so by actual compact, we are not to be burnt

Sequel of the “Kossuth Fever.”
# THE Austrian correspondent of the Times says, that the “Kossuth ſever in England” passes “com-
paratively unnoticed” at Vienna. It is to be hoped that FRANcis-Joseph is prepared with a suffi-

CIVIC MODESTY.
SIIENCE, if you please, for the great
Oracle of the City! It is SIR PETER
LAURIE who is speaking :-
“He would unhesitatingly say that the ad-
ministration of justice by the Aldermen of the
City of London was not surpassed by the exer-
tions and judgment of any other portion of the
Magistracy of the Metropolis.”
Now, when we consider that SIR
PETER is himself one of the admini-
strators of justice in the City of Lon-
on, and that consequently he , is
speaking of himself, as well as of
brother administrators, we must say
that the above opinion strikes us as
one of the most modest things we have
read for a long time. If we mistake
not, the great act of SIR PETER
LAURIE’s magisterial life has been a
determination to “put down” every-
thing. In fact, he has carried out this
determination so .# that he is
known as the Greatest Putter-Down
of the present day. He has worked so
strenuously, that there does not re-
main a single thing for him to put
down but one—and we wish he would
end his magisterial career by puttin
that down as speedily as possible. It
would be a fit termination to a public
life that has been maintained with such
admirable consistency throughout.
As SIR PETER began, so let him finish.
He began some twenty years ago by

be so fortunate, and yet there is one
Marshal whose name will be proudly
associated with his name, and be
awarded a large share of all the Pre-
sident's successes. He has already
achieved an eminent reputation for
his numerous expeditions through
France, and so highly is he esteemed,
that at the present moment no less
than three departments, and the whole
of the sixth military command, are
under his immediate command. The
name of this mighty Marshal—this

reign—is, we need scarcely state,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WONDERS OF HUNGERFORD HALL.
ESPECTED MR. PUNCH,
“AccEPT my thanks
commenting on my
communication to you
respecting the exhibi-
tion of Mesmeric thau-
at Hungerford Hall. I
could ask you to let me
quote this º: in ertenso; but
your space, I know, is capable only
of limited contents; neither “gods,
men, nor columns”—particularly
the columns of Punch-admit of
the impossible: and there are some
impossibilities, pace the Mesmerists.
“Perhaps, however, you will
allow me to cite my correspondent’s
arguments, in a concentrated form,
which will render them none the
weaker: and thus concentrated,
peradventure you will allow me to
rectify them for the public market;
wherein Mesmerism just now is
somewhat quoted.
“Your correspondent begins }
complaining that I violate, wit
respect to Mesmerists, the law maxim, that everyman is to be accounted
honest till proved to be a rogue. So complain homoeopathists, so com:
Fº so complain astrologers, so complain Papist
and other fanatics: so complain miracle-mongers of all classes, against
the world at large. The marvellousness of their assertions induces
close scrutiny of their facts: and this they take as a personal affront.
You, Mr. Punch, like all other philosophers, when you have made
some extraordinary discovery, test it in all manner of ways, before you
confirm yourself in its belief ; not, Sir, with your mens conscia recti,
that you suspect yourself to be a rogue, but because you are aware
that you are fallible. Mesmerists expect to be trusted more implicitly
than you would trust yo In the meanwhile, men of common
sense form this canon:—Intolerance of scepticism, in matters of science,
is presumptive evidence either of imposture or enthusiasm:, and, if
your correspondent is a smoker, I commend this screw of philosophy
to his pipe.
“Your worthy, but illogical, º: writes as if I had denied
the verity of the phenomena exhibited by Miss PRUDENCE, or produced
between her and §. LassaignE...Not I, Mr. Punch. I simply argued
that they were “not proven.' I will believe in transmission of thought,
or anything else, that I am allowed to satisfy myself of by, rigid expe.
riment. I am ready to acknowledge the liquefaction of the blood of
St. JANUARIUs, if DR. NEwMAN will persuade the Neapolitan friars to
let me have the bottle, and the Saint's head, and apply the latter to
the former at a temperature of 32°.
“My “wonderful serpent-walking,” as your correspondent calls it—
I agree with him—simply proved that “the Professor' had succeeded
in influencing Miss PRUDENCE, and that I had not. Had a series of
similar experiments been tried by other persons equally sceptical—and,
I will add, equally candid—with myself, it would have proved some-
thing more, ... my experiment only went towards proving—namely,
that the will of one of the parties, at least, had nothing to do with the
result. I must remind your correspondent that the “wonderful ser.
pent-walking' was not mine: it was MR. LassaignE's and Miss PRU-
DENCE's: and I saw nothing more wonderful in it—as the case stood—
than in many a trick of a professed wizard.
“Your correspondent's evidence of the transmission of his own
thoughts to Miss PRUDENCE, would, if corroborated by that of a
sufficient number of other credible witnesses, doubtless establish that
lady's power of thought-reading. But it, is just that corroboration
which is wanting to Mesmeric marvels. For the production of such
evidence, moreover, the theatre of the Royal Institution, or some other
such arena, is the proper place, and not your pages, Mr. Punch. Let
not your correspondent jump—he is a good jumper—to the conclusion
that I consider him a knave. A jury may refuse to convict on evidence
which it believes thoroughly honest. Would your correspondent con-
ceive himself insulted because it was determined not to hang a man on
his unsupported testimony ?
“As to the question of Miss PRUDENCE's power to attract the
magnet, that, Mr. Punch, you may easily settle. Present your com-
pliments to DR. FARADAY ; tell him that you know a person who, as
you seriously believe, possesses this power; and ask him to be so kind
as to investigate the fact. DR. FARADAY, I warrant, will only be too
happy to verify a phenomenon more interesting than any which he has
matur
wish
for sending me a letter, be
yet demonstrated in his own peculiar science. Unless, Mr. Punch—
unless-DR. FARADAY should set you down for a credulous ass.
“Your correspondent insinuates that, because I do not understand
the Electric Telegraph, I ought to disbelieve in it, consistently with my
unbelief in Mesmeric miracles. I believe in the Électric #º.
:cause I can verify its action at any time for the sum of one shilling,
with no extra change of ‘scepticism;’ to say nothing of the concurrent
evidence of mankind: rather more powerful reasons than have been
offered by your correspondent or anybody else, on behalf of the pro-
digies of Animal Magnetism, to “THE Sceptical GENTIEMAN."
ALARMING SACRIFICE IN HYMENEALS.
..THE following handbill has been sent to Mr. Punch, who honours the
bill by insertion:—

To this notification no printer's name is affixed. Mr. Punch can
therefore hardly imagine it to be a bond ſide document. He rather sus-
pects it must be the composition of some wag of a clerk, reverend or
parochial, who intends to satirise a system of underselling pursued at
the opposition church. But, Punch, sees nothing disgraceful in doing
marriages at two-and-six. The goods needs must be genuine. A mar.
riage can't be supplied cheap and nasty. It is gratifying to see com-
tition bringing wedlock down—making even matrimony reasonable.

MR. PUNCH sat for the purpose of trying offenders, some of whom,
when brought to the bar of public opinion, at once pleaded guilty. The
following are a few of the principal delinquencies.

and wounding the English language, by asking, “Of what sex is the

A shabby-genteel looking person was next charged with uttering the
following counterfeit joke –
“What tree is it which is not affected by the season, and brings
forth neither blossom nor fruit *—The Boot-Tree.”
After the jury had been absent for several hours, the foreman entered
the Court, declaring that there was no chance of their agreeing in a
verdict. The Judge told them that, under these circumstances, they
had better go home.
A youthful individual, with a vacant stare, was next put to the bar
under the following melancholy circumstances. Having passed the
evening in company with a . he was about to bid the other good
night, when, turning suddenly round, he exclaimed, in a very unusual
tone of voice, “When is Fleet Street, like the country without a
Government?—When there’s no cab-in-it (cabinet).” The Jury
immediately returned a verdict of acquittal, on the ground of insanity.
The Court then rose.

to one of HER MAJESTY's
Godless Colleges, MASTER
Mouloy Molony, brother
of Tuan Deus #ſolony,
Esq., of the Temple, a

Whole hayps of logicians, potes, schollars, grammarians,
All ayger for pleeces, all panting to rise;
I gaze round the world in its utmost diminsion;
ARD JAHN and his minions in Council I ask,
Was there ever a Government-pleece (with a pinsion)
But children of Erin were fit for that task?
What, Erin beloved, is thy fetal condition?
What shame in aych boosom must rankle and burrun,
To think that our countree has ne'er a logician
In the hour of her deenger will surrev her turrun
On the logic of Saxons there’s little reliance,
And, rather from Saxons than gather its rules,

WE have not yet learngd who is the fortunate holder of the great prize
that was to be drawn a day or two ago, in the Great French Lottery of
the Ingots of Gold. There is, however, this consolation for the disap:
pointed,—that it is in the power of the whole six million, nine hundred
and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and minety-nine, who do not
get the prize, to embarrass the lucky one who does, by demanding a
scrutiny. The money will, of course, remain in abeyance until the process
of scrutinising each ticket is completed.

OUR POST BAG.
PUNCH has been favoured with a large batch of 'communications,
sealed with every species of heraldic device, and containing apologies
for the absence, so much complained of, of the “upper classes” from the
demonstrations in favour of Kossuth. When the great Hungarian
knows the many important duties which devolve on our “higher
orders,” he will, we feel sure, be the first to excuse them.
No. 1.
“The EARL of BELDERTON presents his compliments to Mr. Punch,
and begs to direct his attention to the enclosed paragraph.”
The “paragraph,” thus laconically pointed out to our notice,
announces the meet of the Scrambly Hunt at Gorse End. So goes
one batch of sympathisers away—across country.
No. 2 is a dashing, flippant little note; as follows:–
“DEAR PUNCH,-If you would drop your confounded sympathies
with Justice and Freedom, and that kind of thing, you would be a
devilish deal more amusing. How can I attend to Kosshoot (sic)
when CHARLEY B. wants me over at Paris to see his Bustard eat
ten Guinea Pigs; and I’ve got to raise money before I start
“BEARDLEY DE CAss.”
The next note we come to is marked “Confidential,” but we have
more pluck than the writer, and print it, regardless of his feelings.
He would be a very good fellow, if he dared. His seal bears, quarterly
first and fourth arg, a chevron between three trivets, sa..; second and
third, a fess dancettee. A most respectable bearing !
“MY DEAR SIR,-You ask me why I did not come up from Harrowby,
and see Kossuth, and attend one of his meetings. Between ourselves,
he’s a very fine fellow, plucky, and eloquent—as anybody can see
in a twinkling. And really these Austrians are a set of * (here a word
is rigidly erased)—“I mean not the men I like—not such men as my
ancestor in 1688, who came up to town to back old SoMERs and SUNDER-
LAND, and so on. Then, fancy what a figure any of us would make hold-
ing forth in Hungarian' But then there 's a grandmother of mine,
and there’s my aunt—and—and is not Kossuth somehow mixed up
with the Socialists, and the first French Revolution, and so on ?
cº Yours very truly,
“P.S.—Does BRONTERRE O’BRIEN belong to the THOMOND family P*
No. 4 appears to be written by a quiet antiquarian gentleman, who
informs us that he is of the RENDLEs of Rendle, and is claiming the
old barony of Tubton. He passes his life among the Record offices
and Collections of wills in the empire. We are sorry that we cannot
answer his final question with regard to the marriage of MATILDA DE
BILBOEs with one of the MONTMORENCYs in 1381.
We pass over such ordinary apologies as gout, weather, and the
“wretched state of agricultural affairs.” One gentleman is preserving
his game; another, is building a church for a Puseyite; a third, is looking
after the next election; a fourth, administering justice; a fifth, add ng a
wing to the family mansion; a sixth, paying his son's College debts. We
are desirous of taking a charitable view of these various excuses. And,
after all, it has been a very good shooting season 1
* ST. ALBAN AND HIS FLOCK.
‘ST. ALBAN's Agricultural Show has been largely attended. Amon
the company several persons of political notoriety were daily observed.
The main attraction was that portion of the live stock, generally famous
—if we may use the expression—as ST, ALBAN’s black sheep. The
Coppockbreed attracted great notice, and the EDWARDs variety was
scanned with eager interest. The attention of the visitors, however,
was chiefly concentrated on the sixty-year-old prize ram WAGGETT,
exhibited after pasture on the coast of Boulogne. The animals were
quoted at from £5 to £10 a-head, but it is believed that they will be
worth little or nothing when shorn, as they are expected to be next
Session; for they are known to be so much eaten up by the rot as to
be, in fact, little better internally than a mass of corruption.
Useless Timber of the Colonial Office.
DR. HopgkIN, at the meeting of the Aborigines and Peace Societies,
is reported to have stated, that the Caffres say to the British, “Send us
our sticks, and we will obey them, instead of bringing your troops.”
This is not fair to Downing Street. Has Lord GREY ever sent to the
Cape of Good Hope, or to our other colonies, any rulers but Sticks f

Number One, that is greaterre than all these.” Then they askēd him
“Where is this Number One, and under what image is he worshipped P’’
Then ST, ALBANs, took from his pouche medalles in golde, and

A WOTE-IVE OFFERING.
MR. Edwards, of St. Albans notoriety, is said to sport “a massive
silver snuff-box, the result of a penny subscription among one thousand
of the electors, and presented to him as a mark of esteem, as
well as in token of their disapprobation of the persecution to which he
has been subjected.” We should like to know the sort of snuff the
electors were up to, when they presented MR. Edwards with this box,
and whether it was filled with “blackguard,” by way of reminding him
of themselves. Undoubtedly, a very capacious snuff-box must be
required by a man who has constantly somuch corruption under his very

ExTERTAINMENTs. To-morrow, 12th, at Waltham Abbey.
We are afraid this MR. NewMAN wants to “come the old, soldier”
over the public, by giving his popular entertainments at an Abbey. He
has no right to call himself unrivalled NewMAN: clever as may be his
ventriloquism, its marvels are surpassed by saints that shine in the
dark, and cross the sea on their cloaks.
ELECTRICAL CLOCKS.
IN Berlin they have Electrical Clocks—and in Stockholm, all the public
clocks are ſº in motion by electricity. Why could not the same plan
be adopted in London? By this means, the various contradictions
that, exist amongst our public clocks might be remedied, and there
would not be the difference of five hours, as there frequently is, between
two clocks, in two neighbouring streets. We would not simply
have our public clocks º in this manner, but also our private
clocks. e do not see why the clocks on every floor, in every man's
house, could not be brought under the controul of electricity. Surely,
it must be just as easy to lay on electricity as water or gas, and there
is one comfort, that it would not cost one hundredth part as much,
. Our plan is this. Let there be one grand central Electrical Clock
in the Metropolis. Say the Horse-Guards, if you like—though that
public clock has, in a great measure, lost its mili reputation for
punctuality, ever since it fancied, because it belonged to the Guards,
that it could go on as it pleased, and keep whatever hours it liked.
However, say, for old association's sake, the Horse-Guards Clock.
This would be the Grand Electrical Depôt, and would regulate all the
Electrical Clocks in the Metropolis—may, throughout all the Kingdom,
if it were necessary. The electric fluid would be turned on every
morning with no more difficulty than the equivocal fluid which is given
us as pure water by our water companies. The clocks would never
want winding up, and there would be one uniform time all over
London. Differences as to Greenwich time, and Railway time, and
London time, would all cease, and our church clocks would no longer
be able to play of those absurd vagaries which, for along time, put at
sixes and sevens all those watches that put faith in their professions; for
every servant should have an electrical clock in her bedroom, and would
no longer be able to make the usual mistake of an hour in gettingu
of a morning; and cooks, when they were late with the dinner, woul
no longer be able to place the fault on the kitchen-clock. Greater
method by these means would be º: in every household, whilst
out of doors the advantages would be equally numerous. many
persons...would not be late for the train, from finding that there
was a difference of twenty minutes between railway time and the time-
piece they had left at home on their mantel-piece. A greater degree
of re ty would be observed in our daily engagements, and a man
who broke an appointment through *::::::::::::: or kept a dinner-
F. waiting, or wasn't in time for a picnic, or a wedding, would be
ooked upon as an unsocial monster, who ought to have lived in the
days, of the slow coaches, and not in a periodlike the present, when,
º: º electricity, everything goes, or promises to go, exactly “like
clockwork.”
THE TYRANNY OF CUSTOMS.
(To Louis Kossuth.)
EveRED SIR, - Don’t run
away with the idea that
this is a free country. A
tyranny is exercised by the
ritish Board of Customs
as monstrous as any in-
justice perpetrated on Hun-
garian or Polish victims,
either by the young NERo
of Austria, or the Russian
old Nick. The London
Dock Company has just
compromised a lawsuit
which it, had commenced
against this Board for ille-
gal seizures of the Com-
pany's goods, consenting to
pay £100 fine, under pro-
test. The Company stoutly maintains the unlawfulness of the seizures,
and is confident that, had it proceeded to trial, it would have gained its
cause. Why, º will ask, did it compromise the matter? Why,
Sir, because even if it had obtained a verdict, it would have been
let in, as our yulgar say, for ruinous law expenses. The reason-
would you, believe it, Sir?—is that “the Crown pays no costs.”
Government may, under a false pretence, clap its claws on the British
merchant's property; subject him to enormous loss and trouble;
make him pay more than it is worth to get it back again, and refuse
to indemnify him for his expenses one farthing. This is our land of
liberty, illustrious KossuTH! Take with you this little piece of
information, from 33Uſ?Cº.

THE LAW OF DOMESTIC STORMS.
Y a long series of
observations it has
been found that
Domestic Storms,
like other storms,
are rotatory; or,
in other words,
they move in a
circle, and come
round at regular
intervals. The
Domestic Storm,
as we have already
§§ seen, rages fre-
quently very high
at about Christmas
time, when the
trade winds are
prevalent. There
is reason to believe
that these trade
winds, which come
in counter direc-
tions, are preceded
by much heavy
swelling, and b
the extreme lati-
tude into which
the master has
been driven by the
eccentric action of
his craft. This
was the case in the
instance of the
Eliza, which, after
being first set in
- motion by gentle
airs, º: her head completely to the wind, and the mate lost all
control over her. An extract from his log—or diary—is full of
. for those to whom the Law of Domestic Storms is a matter
of interest.
Monday.—Light breeze, with a cloudy aspect.
Tuesday—Her head beginning to turn. All sorts of airs. Nothing
In View.
Wednesday.—Objects more clear.
running on to bank. Stormy at night,
gether threatening.
Thursday—inclined to be more calm. Changed her tack. Received
a slight check. Towards night stormy again. Spoke Policeman, A 1,
but could render no assistance.
Friday.-Hurricane continued all day. Split her stays. Squally at
night. Carried away the sheet, and went over on her larboard side.
Saturday.—Violent gusts. Her head carried away, everything
dashed to pieces, and every attempt to “wear” the craft quite unsuc-
cessful. Tried to overhaul her; but she became so unmanageable, that
cutting away from her was the only chance of safety. Succeeded in
etting clean off, and left her to her fate, when she was seen at a
istance to be brought to of her own accord rather rapidly.
Domestic Storms do not always proceed from the highest points, but
frequently arise from the lowest; and some curious phenomena have
been remarked under-ground, where a sort of blowing-up begins, such
as may be sometimes noticed in Cook and other great authorities.
These storms are often preceded by the sudden carrying away of stores,
and by the accumulation of a sort of dripping in the hold, which when
called to the attention of the master, causes him to prepare for a
hurricane. -
Some remarkable facts are mentioned by travellers as accompanying
storms, such as showers of fish falling on land having been cast up by
the violence of the sea; but in Domestic Storms nothing is more
common than a shower of cups and saucers, wine glasses, books, and
candlesticks. In a very violent Domestic Storm that happened in the
neighbourhood of one of the squares, the convulsions of nature, and of
ill-nature, were so fearful, that during the raging of the storm, which
took a pelting and pitiless shape, four looking glasses were sinashed to
pleces.
The agents by which storms are sometimes produced in the domestic
circles are sparks, which strike, with electrical influence, the heads of
some of the lighter craft, and render them .." difficult to manage.
The law of magnetic attraction will affect the heads of craft of this
º bringing them round and round, and exposing them to that
sort of whirl which is so notoriously dangerous. The best remedy in
Difficulty in keeping her from
Squalls, and appearance alto-
these cases is a good conductor, or by meeting the sparks, with an
opposing battery. Sometimes a tremendous swell will agitate the craft;
but in #. cases it is better to let the swell pass by, merely keeping
the head of the craft in the right direction.
MEDICINE FOR THE MILLION.
THERE is a fashion in quackery, as in everything else; and medicines
go out and come in just like hoops, long waists, hanging sleeves, or any
other article that caprice may one day patronise and the next day
**. -
ormerly pills carried everything before them, and people swallowed
their hundreds of No.2, with a disregard to No. 1 that was really
astonishing. After pills had had their day, there was a slight move-
ment in favour of lozenges, until the public suddenly, turned to oint-
ment, and stuck to it for a tolerably long period. The last new mania
is for Sarsaparilla, which is said “to destroy every kind of humour;”
and as humour happens to be an article in which we take some interest,
we must set our face against any article that has the effect of
destroying it. -
We should be glad if the Editor of Notes and Queries would answer
a little problem we will venture to Fº to him. We would ask
him how it is that anybody dies at all, when there are several hundreds
of quack medicines, each of which is said to save annually so many
millions of lives, that by adding up even a portion of them, it would
seem that the lives of the whole human race are being saved every
year; * yet the number of deaths will go on at about the same rate
aS uSulal.
The advertising statistics will also show that the quantity of children
cured of juvenile maladies by one sort of stuff or the other, will exceed
the whole number brought into the world during the period specified.
We can only solve the difficulty by supposing that the same child is
cured over and over again, in order to warrant the estimate.
KOSSUTH FOR THE MILLION.
To the Genteel.
SweLLs, the higher walks that tread,
Sneer away—’tis underbred
To applaud the Man who led
The Mob of Hungary!
Now’s your day, and now's your hour!
Threatºning clouds no longer low'r;
Scornful—in your ease and power—
Of the People be.
Who will call KossuTH a knave 2
Who traduce the good and brave?
Who will be that Russian slave,
But Gentility?
Who for HAYNAU's martial law,
Fiction's bow will boldly draw,
Cat with woman-scratching claw
ere may live to see.
Smile at Exile's woes and pains !
Scoff at vanquish’d Honour's chains,—
Keep your cool and quiet veins
From excitement free.
Only hearts of orders low
E'er with sympathy can glow,
No, Superior Classes, no!
Fiddle olde-dee!
An Extreme Publican.
THE following extract from the examination of MR. BLANKs, land-
lord of the White Hart Inn, at the St. Albans Bribery Commission, is
worth preserving:—
“Mr. Forsyrh.-What are your principles?"
* Witness.--To spend money in all legitimate expenses." (Laughter.)
* MR. Forsyrh.--You mean spending money with publicans, I suppose?” (Laughter.)
“Witness.-Well, I don't know. We all look to our trade, of course.”
MR; BIANKs means to say that, in his political views, he simply
regards the good of the public.
A SIMPLE QUESTION.
THE |estion has been going the round of the papers, “What is a
Pound?
* Every donkey on a common, we should think, could tell that.

apparatus, that had been sent in for the use of the Court, and had not
been satisfactory. -
It having been intimated that their Lordships were now ready to go
º with whatever was in the paper, the Times was handed up to
them.
In the course of the day, a rule was applied for by a Carpenter, who
had left it behind when measuring one of the windows of the Court,
on the day preceding.
Chief Justice, You may take your rule.
The rest of their Lordships concurred. Rule Granted.
SITTINGs IN ERRoR.—Their Lordships having been given to under-
stand that Counsel would be ready to move during the afternoon,
remained in Court all day; but no learned gentleman 'having appeared,
the learned Chief intimated that it must be considered as the first of
their Sittings in Error. - -
After some delay, the following conversation ensued between the
Bench and an emiment Queen's Counsel: ,
The Bench (to the Q. C.). “Ifancied you intimated, just now, that you

Q. C. “No, my Lords, I did not intend to move. It was only my

Beneath her feet was i. -dropping;
Each with his heel upon a nation's forehead,

Nations-that, stripp'd of all wherein they gloried,
Were lying gagged and bound.
There, Italy, still lovely through her ish,

Her cheeks were sunk and white, i. theirs who languish
For years in dungeons deep.
demº with her kind face, made for loving,
ow writhen, sharp, and sour,
Lay, ever and anon her large limbs moving,
alf conscious of their power.
Passionate Poland her chained hands clenching,
While her full Eastern eye Was Clen
With fires of hate, perennial and unblenching,
Glared upwards to the sky.
And like a war-spent soldier, faint and breathless,
ungary, prostrate there,
Lay, seeming wounded to the death; but deathless
Was her defiant stare.
At first, the seat where Anarch Force was sitting,
Šeemed set in living stone,
And all those mail-clad guards, supporters fitting
For such a firm-based throne.
But, lo! the clamps which chair to base did fasten'
Were almost eat away;
And the blood jº. from the knout did hasten
A change of rock to clay;
And those huge guards, whose firm and even treading
Seemed proof’gainst overthrow,
On foot-hold wet with gore of their own shedding
Slipped, swaying to and fro.
Then she and they, with jubilant acclamations,
Their song of triumph sung—
An impious Te Deum o'er the nations
That 'neath their feet were flung.
But all at once that song did check and waver,
Then stopped with sudden jar,
As a voice came, low first, but swelling ever—
A voice, heard, from afar,
Singing like a caged bird, in spite of chains,
- And calumny, and wrong—
Singing like one who, looking from the plains,”
Sees morning strike along
The mountain-tops, and tells how with the day
The sunlight will descend,
And chase the mists that choke the valley gray,
Muffling it, end to end.
Anon, from hope rising into defiance,
It spoke with trumpet tone,
Calling mankind to holiest alliance
'Gainst Brute Force on her throne.
And, though in a strange tongue, with wondrous power
That deep voice filled the land,
Till Anarch Force upon her throne did cower;
Her sword shook in her hand;
And her huge guards were sudden terror-stricken,
... With dull brows ashy-white;
While those down-trodden Nations seemed to quicken
With new-awakened might,
Thrilled by the power that in their half-numbed members
Aroused the pulse of men, w
Like the seer's word that kindled life's dead embers
In the dry bones again.

SCENE 1.-MRs. BAKER PURCHASEs A PET.
Place–Regent Street. Time—Two P. M.
The usual Loungers and Passengers.-MR. CHIFFINs, a quiet man, with an er-
pression of face half horse-jockey, half field-preacher, and a dress compounded
of the prize-fighter, gentleman's groom, and gamekeeper, is walking up and down ;
a resplendent “King Charles” under one arm, a preternaturally clean poodle
under the other, and a knot % soi-disant Skye Terriers, questionable Spaniels, and
extremely uncomfortable Italian Greyhounds, in a string, about his feet. MRs.
BAKER has been out shopping. She has recently lost a favourite Cat, and the
vacuum left by the bereavement is not yet filled up. She has always had a tender.
ness for dumb animals.
Mr. Chiffins (whose experienced eye has detected MRs. BAKER's weak point). Nice
dog, Marm KING CHAwLs, Ma'am—there’s ears, Ma'am—ekal to floss silk—
(continuing to walk the side of MRs. BAKER, who tries not to betray her
sensibility)—Or a Poodle, Marm 2–do anythink but speak. Buys buns, Marm, and
leaves the penny on the counter as natºral as a Christian. Or, if you'd like a Skye
Terrier, , there’s a Ficº. Can't see out of his eye for 'air, and a coat as
sweeps the ground. Ah! you’re a-lookin' at that Italian greyhound, Marm, I can
see; he is a beauty. Only four pound, Marm. Come, what do you say for one
on 'em P_ Make me an offer, now. Bless you, Marm, name your figger.
Mrs. Baker. No, thank you. . I don't want one.
Mr. Chiffins. Ah! you’re a lady as loves dumb hanimals, I can see. Now,
there’s a Spannel, M. you shall’ave him for one pun’ ten—a finebred dawg as
ever was: sweet as a nut, and wonderful fond of his missus.
Mrs. Baker (with a faint pretence to Utilitarianism). Is he a good º:
. Mr. Chiffins. Ouse-dog, Marm? Bless you, nothink can't come near where he
is, arter dark-he’ll tear the place down.
Mrs. Baker. Oh! then he might bite somebody.
Mr. Chiffins. Lor, Marm! he knows the difference atween
one party and another; he don’t never show his teeth at
the right sort o' people, only, at beggars and cadgers, and
such like, as is arter no good—'ad the distemper, Ma’rm,
these six months. There’s a hye, Marm. Bless the cretur !
Wouldn't you say he was a talkin' to you?
Mrs. Baker (who ſ. strongly inclined towards the er-
tremely hybrid animal about which MR. CHIFFINs is so enthu-
siastic). What is his name P
Mr. Chiffins. ScAMP, Marm, is the name I’ad with him
—leastways from the party I bought him ov.
Mrs. Baker. You’re sure he’s not been stolen?
Mr. Chiffins (with much horror). Stolen! Marm? Nobody
never could say of Tom CHIFFINs as he ever º; a dawg
wich he didn't know all was square (shaking his head). No,
no; none o' them games for CHIFFINs
Mrs. Baker. But I should be sure to lose him,
Mr. Chiffins (steadily, and with conviction). Lose that
dawg, Marm? I’ll be bound you couldn't do it, if you tried
—leastways if you takes care on 'em, wich I see you’re a
lady as loves dumb animals. Bless you, they knows when
they’re well orf, them kind of dawgs. They’ll eat their
way through anythink, them dawgs will.
Mrs. Baker. Thirty shillings, you said P
..Mr. Chiffins. Thirty bob is the lowest price I can take for
Im.
Mrs. Baker. Oh, I wouldn’t think of giving more than a
pound !
Mr. Chiffins. Well, Marm, you mustn't be 'ardon me. Say
º: and it’s a deal; but the dawg's worth two
pound, if he's worth a farden.
Mrs. Baker. Well, if you like to take twenty-five shillings
for the dog, and if you’ll bring him to my house, No. 6,
Blossom Terrace, Bayswater—
Mr. Chiffins. All right, Marm—I knows the 'ouse. ...Ah!
that’s a hout-an-out cheap dawg, that is; but you ladies is
so knowin', there’s no getting a profit out o' you.
Mrs. Baker (introducing herself to her new acquisition, and
trying to pat him on the back). Here, ScAMP ScAMP
[ScAMP cowers between the legs of MR. CHIFFINs, and
resents MRs. BAKER’s familiarity by showing his
teeth, and growling.
Mrs.WBaker (repelled by the dog's manner). Oh, he doesn’t
seem at all good-tempered!
Mr. Chiffins. Oh, bless you," Marm! it’s only 'is play,
'Ere (in a tone of affectionate command), ScAMP, 'ere, speak to
the lady, there's a good dawg |
[ScAMP, at the solicitation of MR. CHIFFINs, condescends
to wag his tail slightly, which MRs. BAKER construes
into a mark of incipient attachment to herself, and
goes on her way much pleased with her bargain.
TIME'S OUT OF MIND.
IT used to be said that time and tide wait for no man;
but no man need wait for time and tide; nor is there any
occasion for him to be tied to time, now that we have
ot the Submarine Telegraph. On two or three occasions,
f. week, the papers intimated that the French mail had
not arrived at Dover;, but the public cared little for the
French mail, when all the important French news was con-
centrated in a single line—that line being no other than
the telegraphic wire across the Channel. The strong
winds may blow and crack, their cheeks to the fullest
extent, but it matters not as long as they do not affect the
still small voice of the Submarine Telegraph. -
There has recently been some discussion as to uniformity
of time throughout England; but, really we take no
interest, in the question; for now, that news can go from
one, end of Europe to the other in no time at all, we
shall begin to think that watches and clocks are getting
obsolete, and time itself so thoroughly set at nought, as to
be unworthy of being noted. -
The idea of getting knocked into next week used to
be a vulgar absurdity; but when we find ourselves, in rela-
tion to news, at least a weekin advance of what was º:
possible a very little while ago, we begin to regard the
notion of knocking into next week as one very capable of
being realised.

ATTRACTED by the promise of a spectacle, with not only “new
scenery, dresses, and decorations;” but with “new, camels, zebras,
Brahmin bulls,” and “everything which can tend to give reality to the
scene,” we proceeded over Westminster Bridge, to the Banks of the
Nile, and entering, a few doors down on the right, we proceeded
straight on till we found ourselves opposite “the ſtººd and Wast
Square of Memphis.”. On reference to our hand-book, or play-bill, we
perceived that the “Memphian Games” were supposed to be going on;
and in one corner of the square, on a small wooden platform, three feet
six, by two feet, nine, we observed three men, engaged in playing at
nothing for nothing, with some blank dice, which were vehemently
shaken up in a tin mug without a handle. While the games were at
their height, a procession made its appearance, headed by Egyptian
warriors, who, it is to be hoped, were on the retired list, and not likely
to be called into active service; for their shields were of about the size
and quality of paper kites, and their only armour was a sort of square
fan-tail, or, “curtain,” as the ladies call it, of cloth, attached to the
back, of their dark, woollen night-caps. These were followed by
riests, in white night-gowns, that ought to have been down to their
eels; but, as one very tall priest had accidentally exchanged night-
gowns with one, very short priest, the former mºſ.º: the fact,
*.the legs of the whole of the priests were encased in long leather
gallers.
The procession introduces, of course, the whole of that “unrivalled
collection of rare animals,” which is always dragged, kicked, poked, and
pinched through every quarter of the globe, in which the Astleian
authors lay the scenes of their, spectacles. Our old and refractory
friends, the two s without tails, writhe through the grand square of
Memphis, as uncomfortably as they wriggle over the Steppes of Tartary
in Mazeppa; or sidle about among the thumps and shoves of a hostile
soldiery in the Wars ºf Affahanistan. “The Golden Altar with the
undying Fire” is certainly a gorgeous affair; but on the night we saw
it, the tow was either damp, or the spirits-of-wine deficient, which
caused the “undying fire” to be very speedily at the point of death,
and it went out rather early in a blaze of anything but triumph. The
procession had scarcely ended when Azael enters, on a clever spotted
cob, and expresses a desire to witness “the gorgeyus cerimonies.” He
is, without much ceremony, dragged on to the platform, where the
vigorous game at nothing is still going on, and having taken his turn at
the tin mug, and thrown out from it the blank dice, he rushes into the
middle of the stage, declaring he has “lost everything,” which signifies
little, as he had nothing-not even a carpet-bag—on his arrival.
An attempt is then made upon his fidelity by a young lady in pink

supernumerary, who enters, a square tea-cadddy, he offers it as an in-
ducement to the young female, who rejects not only that, but a comforter
for the neck, which he also tenders in the tenderest manner. His suit
º quite hopeless; but it appears from his proceedings that he
cherishes a certain scarf, which he keeps alternately pressing to his heart
and his lips, though in reality his nose seems to get it oftenest, and to
make the best use of it. . The young woman in spangles playfully takes
it away from him, when he goes nearly mad, and tears out of his hair
the little rosette of pink ribbon with which it has been trimmed,
buries his face in his fists, and ultimately so misbehaves himself that he
is ordered to be thrown into the Nile as a sacrifice. Six priests are
#. to lead him away, when he seizes an axe of pantomimic
imensions, foolishly left within his grasp, and begins flourishing it about
the bewildered heads of the Memphian clergy. Suddenly he lays down the
axe, and at the same time lays down the axiom, that “the cold heart
can never feel,” and he announces the fact of his readiness for the
Nile, “with its icy bosom crammed to the very brim with hungry
crocodiles.”
In the ensuing act we come to the “Mighty Desert,” consisting of a
Fair of flats, with a large round mark in the centre of the landscape.
This mark, which at first struck us as one of the “Mysteries of
Memphis,” was soon explained when a carpenter's whistle was heard,
and the landscape opened to the extent of the mark, in order
that Azael—who has survived submersion in the Nile, and found the
crocodiles rather more benevolent, or abstemious, than he expected—
may witness the appearance of the Dream Spirit. Azael expresses a
wish to go in º of his father; but, instead of doing so, he goes
through some difficult contortions, dragging himself along the ground,
tottering a little way in one direction, and then staggering back again–
his movements requiring the most violent exertion and great physical
strength—when, after i. wasted as much time and strength as
would have taken him a mile at least on his way, he declares his
inability to move a step further. He is, somehow or other, dragged off
when his venerable ºf: appears in a wig of black velvet, with a sm
blue piping-run through it here and there, to give it a dash of grey—the
result of two whole acts of suffering. Being an agriculturist, his
presence is required at a harvest festival, represented by about a
quarter of a truss of real straw and a dozen painted haycocks.
The son and the father meet; but as the son's wardrobe has dwindled
to a suit of fleshings and a door-mat, the father does not know him, and
is going through the usual preliminaries to a stage recognition by
tottering backwards, when a cry from a benevolent “wag” in the
gallery, of “Come, come, hold up, old man—hold up!” restores the
broken-hearted parent to a consciousness of the necessity for preserving
the perpendicular. Everybody, of course, rushes into everybody’s
arms, the scarf is hugged and kissed, the old man's black velvet hair
piped with blue, is parted on his forehead by his enraptured son, and
by the aid of a magic lantern—happily at hand in “the Peaceful Valley”
—there is a Grand “Superhuman reappearance of the Nocturnal Vision
of the Desert.”
Our account of Azael, at Astley's, may be somewhat too literal for
those of a poetic imagination; but when we say that it is gorgeously got
up, with all the liberality and spirit of an Astley's management, we are
sure we shall send many more to the theatre than we shall deter from
going there, by our very common-place view of an uncommonly mag-
nificent spectacle.
NOTES AND QUERIES FOR COMMUNISTS AND RED
REPUBLICANS.
A CoRRESPONDENT wishes to know how and whence could have origi-
nated so extraordinary a proposition as the dogma that “property is
theft.” From the circumstance, we should say, that the gentleman
...! propounded it, had no idea of acquiring anything except by
stealing.
Another Correspondent casts a doubt on the correctness of the or-
thography of the word “Rouges,” the French name for the ultra-
republicans, and by us translated “Reds.” He suggests that “Rouges,”
as applied to the party of disorder, is a corruption of an Anglicism, to
be rectified by the transposition of two letters and inquires whether
it should not be properly spelt “Rogues.”

THE SCHOOL FOR POOR CHILDREN.
We have always maintained that the Blue-coat School was an
institution where none but poor, children were received. Here is
another proof, in addition to a hundred others which have already been
published, that there never is the slightest departure from the charter
aſ its benevolent donor, no matter in whose favour it may be exercised.
The School is known to be a sacred spot where the rich have no
influence—where the poor only are allowed to enter—and London
º to be proud of having within its monied walls such a holy
ace.
p This is the proof in question, which we cut out of the evidence given
before the St. Albans Bribery Commission:
“He (Mr. Edwards) had a brother in the Blue-coat School. MR. Bond CAbbºtt,
who was once member for St. Albans, and for whom his father acted as agent, presented
him to the school after he was elected for the Borough.”
Now, MR. Bond CAB8ELI, it is sufficiently known at all the
guinea dining-places in the Metropolis, is a very poor man. In
short, the mere fact of his being a member for St. Albans, is the
strongest proof of his poverty. MR. Edwarps's father, if we may
judge from the questionable practices to which he lent imº. at
ere,
the St. Albans election, must be a very poor man also.
then, we have a poor man recommend-
ing the son of another poor man—and ſi
no higher recommendation than that of |
their joint poverty is requisite for the son
to be instantly received into the Blue-
coat School. This is most admirable
There is no wealthy influence at work
here—no bending the knee to the Golden
Calf | No election-bargaining—no con-
science buying or cheating ! No! it is
the finest lºſſ. to Poverty—in whose
honour, and for whose solace, the School
was erected : and long life, therefore, say
we, to the Blue-coat School, as long as it
acts up to those noble principles of charity,
which are the text of its charter! Those
noble principles have never been deviated
from since the School has been a School,
and we are so confident that publicity
can only more and more glorify the in-
tegrity of its management, that we should
like to see a published statement of the
number of children who are at present
in the Blue-coat School owing to the
recommendation of Mr. Bono Caºpeii.
Who knows? the number of little ED-
waRDSEs may be infinite.
A PROPHECY THAT REQUIREs No GREAT
PROPHET TO PROPHESY.
It is not at all improbable that at the
approaching ..." festive season” called
Christmas, MR._FLEXMoRE may dress
himself up as a Bloomer, and it is not
unlikely, either, that, in that elegant cos-
tume, he may dance a pas seul, very much
to the amusement of the Gallery.—Our
Prophet. | -
THE MONS, JULLIEN IN LABOUR AGAIN.
THE JULLIEN era of music must always form an important epoch in the
Calendar; and the Mons is at this moment rearing his lofty head high
above all opposition in Drury Lane.
We never see the Mons. JulLIEN without thinking of the famous
Alpine, Mons;, and ByRoN's lines on the latter are capable of easy
adaptation to the former:
The Mons is the King of Conductors;
They crowned him long ago,
With jet black hair,
And moustachios rare,
And a waistcoat, and stock of snow!”;
We only º that the Mons should be visible for so brief a period
among us, and that, he should only visit us like the “glimpses of the
Moon” for the brief month of November. He is no sooner'come than
he is gone, and we have only just arrived at the knowledge that it is
the “first week but one,” when we find it is also the “last week but two”
of his performances.
We understand that the Mons has in preparation for his next season
a sort of companion to his Army and
Navy Quadrilles, under the title of the
POLICE QUADRILLE,
of which we give the programme.

THE CRISIS OF AFFAIRS.
Fºss ERTAIN Editors are always writin

he had a crisis; but what
the Editor of the Go-a-

“Crisis of Affairs,” is—
“Having to write whilst
the baby is crying, -your
wife is asking you for the
hundredth time what you

the Deaf Asylum to hear

such a Crisis regularly once a week.”

KOSSUTH FOR EVER
WHY do the millions cheer KossuTH, that p's
No greeting to the Democrats of France
Because they feel the difference of a brave
Struggle for Freedom from a frantic dance
Round trees of Liberty, doom'd ne'er to bud,
Wherein the sole reality was blood.
An opera-dance–Terpsichoréan show-
To music of “Mourir pour la Patrie,”
The ballet ending in a grand tableau
Such as at Rome we saw, and still do see;
Crush’d by French arms a twin Republic's hope,
And restoration of our Lord the Pop E.
Between such heroes as a WILLIAM TELL.
Or WASHINGTON.—not our foe, but our king's-
And ill-conditioned dreamers, who rebel
Against the natural ordinance of things,
Britons distinguish; wholly scorning these,
And all their mad pedantic mutinies. I
A strife against the fetters and the lash- . .
Chaining free thought—inflicted on the fair:
A steady, earnest, stern attempt to thrash
A despot doing wrong too dire to bear;
This, this is what we English understand;
This was the battle fought in Magyar land.
Therefore, among the men, Kossuth we class,
Who fairly, truly, fought for Liberty;
We hail him as we should LEONIDAs
Our guest, arisen from Thermopylae;
And hope his eloquence of honest hate
Europe may urge her tyrants to abate.

TO MY BROTHER BRITISH DRAMATISTS.
EAR BROTHERs l—The con-
.ditions of an international
copyright law have been
settled between the Foreign
Ministers of England and
France. An attempt will be
made to embody these con-
ditions in the form of a law
during the ensuing session.
If they are so embodied, the
days of the British Drama-
tists are numbered.
“For among these con-
ditions is one, that protection
is to be given to translations
executed by or for the au-
thor—and this provision is
expressly extended to dra-
matic compositions. Consider the consequences.
“Hitherto the French répertoire has been the common property of
the British Dramatist. This was, indeed, the, only field on which the
old war between France and England was still # up. The bayonet
of the British Grenadier no longer invaded the French frontier, but
the scissors of the Britishl)ramatist still walked proudly into the pages
of the French Vaudevilliste. Need I say that the advantage was ever
on our side; that British pluck bore off the Drama of the Porte
St. Martin, or the Vaudeville of the Variétés, to the friendly ports of
the Victoria or the Haymarket, just as the British frigates towed the
French first-rates into Plymouth or Sheerness? But, who ever saw
France making reprisals, either on our stage plays or our ships of war?
“Thus viewed, the function of the British Dramatist becomes a
national one. He is the solitary upholder of the Briton's right to do
what he likes with the Frenchman's own. This º patriotic prin-
ciple, abandoned by ministers, was still upheld by managers, and a
British public could still salute the trophies of British prowess in
the translations of the British Dramatist. -
But if this iniquitous compact be carried out, all these triumphs are
at an end. The French Dramatist will not lack traitorous co-operation
among our writers for the stage, and henceforth an unnatural and unholy
alliance may be looked for of the French author and the British adapter!
“Brethren, is this to be borne?
“Englishmen, are the rights of the Briton thus to be tamelyabandoned?
“British Dramatists, arise like one man, and swear upon Boyer's
Dictionary, that you will never submit to share with Frenchmen the
hard-earned pittance wrung, from managerial, rapacity. Hitherto
French rolls have been our bread, but let this atrocious compact
become law, and that bread is baked for ever!
“British Dramatists, be up and doing!...Let the Frenchman, when
he comes to ask payment for his shot, find his own piece turned against
him, with a determined British Dramatist, match in hand, ready, if
necessary, to blow the invader into immortal smash!
“Your Brother,
“RopomoNT FITZ-SCRIBE,
“Who has taken upwards of 160 pieces from the
French at the point of his own scissors.”
OLD KING COAL.
OLD KING CoAL paid a very high toll,
And a very high toll paid he ;
And it went in the bottle, and it went in the bowl;
In green fat, ºil. callipee. -
What a shame, what a shame, what a shame! said the people,
What a wrong that this should be
And there’s none whate'er that can compare
To the sons of gluttony.
Old KING CoAL paid a very high toll,
And a very high toll paid he .
And the City ... eat up the whole,
TSy consent of the Powers that be.
This won't do, this won't do, this won't do! says the people;
This must not, shall not be;
And we now declare we’ll no longer bear
Such a monstrous robbery!
THE Power of ABSTRACTING Your MIND.—The man who chalked
the Wall of China with “Free Trade and Starvation,” during an
earthquake, had a singular power of abstracting his mind!
YOUNG NERO'S LAST!
THE EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA was known to be an enemy of progress,
but until he sent, the police, the other day, to regulate the Money
Market, few could have imagined the lengths he was prepared to go in
†. to 'Change. By this manoeuvre he has driven the Bears out
of his kingdom bodily, as if they were actual quadrupeds: a proceeding
which, however, he might have improved upon by setting a price upon
their heads. Some may be surprised to #. this Monarch displaying
such hostility to the Bears, considering the obligations he is under to
one of the family. But the Bear that lowers the Money Market, and
the Bear that tramples down Liberty, are two different animals; and
his Majesty knows the difference between Bear and Bear, if not be-
tween man and brute.
In attacking the Bears by physical force, the Emperor has shown a
measure of wisdom for which he is not likely to get much credit, as it
is little calculated to inspire confidence in the stability of his throne, or
indeed of his senses. ith a view to show that he can control the
exchanges by violence, he will next, perhaps, be sending policemen to
ſº the weathercock: or to repeat CANUTE's experiment upon the
tide. . CANUTE, though, or anybody connected with England, may be
out of his good books just now: as, after the reception this country
* given to KossuTH, he doubtless hates a BULL as much as he does
a Bear.
THE HONEST CABMAN'S COMPLAINT.
CoME, noble lords and ladies, and gentlefolks also,
Attention to my story. I pray 3. to bestow:
A Cabman's is the calling and trade which I pursue
And though I say’t as shouldn't, I’m an honest Cahman, too.
I says the sum of eightpence is our lawful fare per mile;
And wherefore go extortion more with greediness and guile,
Accompanied by insolence, as mostly is the case?
I will not act so brutal, and I won't behave so base.
Why is it, in partic'lar, that we expects to screw
A price out of our customers above the stated due P
Why is a Cabman's bisnis the sole and only trade
Wherein a blessed cove can't be contented ven he's paid?
§º a physician receivin' of his fee,
Said, “Wot's this here?” or, “This won't do!” why not, as well as we?
And then, suppose he foller'd his patient down the street,
Abusin’ and insultin' him, I wonder what he'd meet 2
I don't see why a Cabman's must needs be a pursuit
To make a man a ruffian, a blackguard, and a brute,
A savage, foul-mouthed bully, a villain, and a thief; .
But that’s our general character, which I relate with grief.'
What's wanted is Protection, whereby I mean Free Trade;
Defence in competition which rascals would invade:
Who threatens for to smash our cabs, and drive us off the stand,
For offerin’ civility with cheapness of demand.
The system of our guv'nors too, 'tis proper should be known,
Because the vehicles we drives is few on ’em our own;
So much a #: make what we may, we’re bound to bring 'em back;
Vich if we fail, by consequence, in course, we gets the sack.
Now by this here arrangement, the chap wot drives a cab
Is tempted all he possible can by any means to grab;
Qn which account, few moral coves embarks in such a line,
Ånd them few finds it uphill work, as is the fact with mine.
I am an honest Cabman, as I before have said;
And 'tis hard lines, I 'sure you, for such to yarn their bread;
By means of proper management what soon would cease to be,
And the Public have the benefit as well as coves like me.
The Tree of Knowledge.
IT seems very curious—and we only mention it because it is very
curious—that two of the highest branches of the Tree of Knowledge
should be occupied at the present moment by a Professor and a Doctor,
answering to the names of KANE and BIRCH !
“WHAT SHALL WE HAVE Fob DINNERP”
LADY MARIA CLUTTERBuck writes to us to say, that “the problem
of the Boa Constrictor swallowing the Blanket is easily accounted for.
The poor creature was tired of having nothing but volaille for dinner,
so he thought he would just try a Blanquette.”

THE BALLAD OF SIR. T. TEA-LEAF.
(Being a humble Parallel to the Ballad of SIR John BARLEycoBN.)
—Il-
*S. S4 T
It was three gallant Chinamen,
With long tailand pig eye,
And they have sworn a solemn oath,
SIR. T. TEA-LEAF must die.
And they have ta'en and flung him down
Upon an iron bed,
And underneath, with cruel hand,
Have heaped the ashes red.
They’ve spread him out, and pressed him down,
d turned him o'er and o'er,
They’ve dried him up, until he curled,
And writhed in suffering sore.
In vain he twisted and he turned,
In vain he cried for grace; - --
Tº kept him so, and scorched him till
e grew black in the face.
But finding he was still alive,
Their malice waxed more keen;
They dosed him first with Prussian blue
Till his poor face turned green.
What sparks of life might still remain
Determined to foredo,
They gave him next a bitter draught
Of gum and catechu,
And on his death his name they changed,
Lest men their crime should know,
And when men asked, “Who’s that lies there?”
They answered, “Young PEkoe.”
Whereas his name and family,
It really was Souchong,
Related to the old Congous,
A race both rough and strong.
Lest men should recognise his dust,
To dust when passed away, ,
His calcined bones they kneaded up
With lumps of China clay.
Their poison'd victim then they wrapp'd
In lead, with well-feign'd grief,
And wrote the epitaph outside,
“Here lies SIRT. Tea-LEAF.”
And though their grief was all a sham,
The epitaph was true,
For “here” it said, “a TEA-LEAF lies,”
And “lie” such Tea-leaves do.
Now TEA-LEAF's name is in repute
In lands beyond the sea,
Where maiden ladies love him much,
Under the name Green-tea.
Ah! little dream these ancient maids
Of Chinaman's vile craft,
Northink, while chatting o'er their cups,
There’s poison in the draught.
And little know they of the fate
Poor TEA-LEAF had to dree,
Or in their teapots they would weep
Tears bitter as their tea;
Till with the water of their woe
E’en the first brew was spiled,
And the º: maid would be
Obliged to draw it mild!
Then to poor TEA-LEAF drop a tear,
By poison doomed to fall;
And when there’s green-tea in the pot,
May I not drink—that’s all.
IS THE LORD MAYOR IRRESPONSIBLE *
THE proposal of a vote of thanks to the late LoRD MAYOR-founded on the absurd old principle
of “thank you for nothing”—has raised the impor
tant question—Is the LoRD MAYor irresponsible?
The feeling at the Court of Aldermen seemed to be, that, the elevation to the Monarchy of
sº is too much for anybody's head, or at all events for any citizen's head, to stand;
and per -
on coming to the throne of the Mansion House.
The late LoRD MAYor
aps the fur cap is an emblem of that softening of the upper story which is likely to ensue
we great offence to the rest of the Corporation, by the isolated attitude
he assumed on the paddle-box of the Folkstone steamer, the coach-box of the Boulogne.fly, and
the refreshment room at the Railway Station, on the celebrated civic expedition to Paris...The
wrath of his brother Aldermen, which has been bottled up for some months, and has become all the
crustier on that account, has been poured out upon him at last, with a fulness of body that is
|. embarrassing. Even his apologists
declare that he h fº inflated; and being
inflated, they regard him as a fit subject
to be blown up, which has been done most
unsparingly.
e don’t exactly understand what the
worthy citizens wished the latelord MAYork
to do, by way of giving a more imposing
aspect to the visit of the Corporation to
Paris. Even supposing that he had caused
Gog and MAGog to be included in his suite,
or taken over with him the State Coach, or
got up a Lord Mayor's Show in Paris, he
would not have succeeded in astonishing a
population who see such things better done
every day at their own Hippodrome. Per-
haps he ought to have gone nowhere with-
out his brother Aldermen; but, as it was,
he left Boulogne as one of a party of six
in a small, fly; and he would ha º have
added to the dignity of the City if he had
been one of a party of six-and-twenty in an
omnibus. -
That the Corporation was imperfectly re-
presented by the head without its right and
left hand—the Sheriffs—is true enough:
but why the whole of the Aldermen should
take offence because they were not dragged
forward on every occasion by the Lord
Mayor, is a problem for which we find no
solution.
THE BLACK EAGLE'S SWOOP ON
THE STOCK EXCHANGE.
THE British stock-broker ought to be
grateful that his lot has fallen in the plea:
sant places of Capel Court, London, instead
of the Bourse at Wienna. In that blessed
country the “bulls” are, goaded on...by
bayonets, and the “bears” baited by police-
men, till dealing in the stocks comes to end
in sitting in them, and all the business trans-
acted is in Austrian bonds, in which, to
use the slang of the Money market,
there is always too much tightness to be
easant.
It is certainly abrilliant motion in BARON
KRAuss, and his friend the Town Captain
of Vienna, by way of preventing a panic in
stocks, to get up a panic among stock-
brokers, and to make a rush on the bankers,
as a means of preventing a run on the banks.
But as the Austrian Government, instead
of making money, can only spend it, they
will find it easier to arrest bankers than
bankruptcy; and may shortly look to see
Austrian ideas as much at a discount all
over Europe as Austrian paper currency.
Sign of a Very Severe Winter.
SoME weather-wise MURPHY has been
seizing hold of the Boa Constrictor at the
Zoological Gardens as a sure token that we
are to have a very severe winter. He de-
clares that “the Boa Constrictor swallowed
the blanket entirely, as a matter of in-
stinct. The sagacious creature felt we were
going to have an unusually severe winter,
So it swallowed its blanket to keep its inside
Warm.
GOING SELARES IN THE NAME OF NEED.
WE perceive that the Secretary of a
“Sacramento Gold and Quicksilver Mini
Company” is “NEED AND Co.” Let us
hope that all the shareholders will pocket
large dividends from the old proverb:-"A
friend in Need is a friend indeed!”
To CORRESPONDENTS.—“NAughty
Boy” has not sent his address.

WHAT WE ARE TO EXPECT IN 1852.
THE Democrats are endeavouring to
frighten us with what we are to
expect in 1852. The French
Socialists, especially, seem to
look forward to that year as the
great MILLENNIUM of SocIAL-
ISM. At all the Electoral Com-
mittee Meetings at Paris—that
is to say, where the Police have
allowed those meetings to take
lace—the prºponderating cry
as been, “Wait till 1852.”
We are fully prepared to act
upon that advice, and have cer-
tainly made up our minds to wait
for the new year; but still, we
must confess we are not a little
frightened in so doing.. . It is
evident that the Socialists are
hanging their best hopes ". 1852; and that is but small comfort to
us, who know that their best hopes sometimes delight in assuming
other forms besides that of hanging. We have a great inclination to
turn Democrats ourselves, at least for the whole of the ensuing year;
but, as we have had many uncomfortable proofs of the manner in which
that, fraternal body generally agree amongst themselves, perhaps it
would be greater protection to us if we remain as we are.
But what are we to expect in 1852?–that is the question. We have
peeped—for a peep was quite sufficient (no one who peeped through
the key-hole of Blue Beard's chamber would wish to open the door)—
into some of the French Democratic Almanacks, and really the horrors
that we are promised in the new year would frighten the oldest habitué
of the most horrible theatre on the Boulevard du Crime. . The following
events are positively ſºle days, compared to the fearful changes that are
#º more or less, every minute, during the mind-quaking year of
In January. Louis NApoleon escapes from the Elysée in the basket of a chiffonier.
Proudhon elected Perpetual President. Acting upon the old law, that La Propriété
c'est le Vol, he scrambles all the money found at the Bank, from the top of the Arc de
Triomphe. Every Aristo found wearing shoes is immediately guillotimed.
In February. Grand distribution of the pictures of the Louvre. The famous picture
of the Deluge suspended over the Bains Chinois. Expedition to Rome: Louis NApoleoN
caught in the Vatican, brought back to Paris, and condemned to be shut up in the
same prison with ABD-El-KADER. The Pope lands in England, and sues protection
from DR, CUMMING.
J March. Every Aristo found guilty of wearing a blouse, is condemned to death.-
ubilee.
April. Every Aristo found guilty of wearing a shirt, is condemned to death.-
Jubilee.
May. Every Aristo detected with a pair of trousers, forfeits his head to the outraged
laws of his country.—Another Jubilee,
June. Every Aristo who puts his head under a hat, is condemned to forfeit both to
the 8tate.-More Jubilees!
July. All the shirt-makers, boot-makers, hat-makers, blouse-makers, and tailors,
ruined in France.—Another Jubilee. All the silver of the rich melted down, and every
Democrat in France presented with a silver spoon. Failure of the harvests, and
general famine.—Another Jubilee.
August. Expedition of everybody into Russia, Prussia, and Austria.-EMPERoR of
Russia sent to work in the mines of Siberia; Austria and PRussia brought to Paris,
where they are confined on parole in the catacombs.
September. Monster army invades England, with floating jackets. Paoudhon
crowned, at Highbury Barn, President of United Democratic Europe. London surren-
dered to three months' plunder. Death of 500,000 English tailors from fright. The
QUEEN takes refuge in the Thames Tunnel.
October. Triumphal entry into Paris, Ten Kings, six Emperors, three Queens,
2,683,566 European noblemen of all ranks, with the Load Maron at their head, walk
bare-headed in the procession, with their crowns dangling round their necks. The
crowns are then taken away, and with the precious stones a monster Eagle is manufac-
tured, and placed on the top of the towers of Notre Dame. A grand game at football
afterwards, in the Champ de Mars, with the crown of England. The Lond MAYor of
London, refusing to part with his mace, only escapes death by consenting to act as
Fool to the President's Court.
November. FEARGUs O'Connor appointed Pro-Consul of England, with Louis
BLANC as his Secretary. Signal act of vengeance of LEDRU Rollin upon all the critics
who laughed at his Decline of England. They are shut up in the Tower, and con-
demned for seven years to write laudatory paragraphs upon the book.-Not one sur-
vives the first day's torture. Glorious downfall of the Wealth of England. The
MARQUEss of WesTMINstER is taken up at Temple Bar for writing “I am starving,”
on the pavement.
December. The Democratic Flag floats from every steeple in Europe. Universal
Jubilee and Carnival of all nations at Paris, terminating with the Grande Fête de la
Guillotine, at which the Kixg of NAPLFs is appointed Master of the Ceremonies.
Monster Eagle stolen from Notre Dame by the Boy Jones, and Razzia made in
England in consequence. General Bankruptcy, and Flight of FEARGus O'Coxxor to
China, with the Koh-i-moor. Concluding Tableau of “Punch found mourning over the
ruins of London.”
Such are the horrors which are apparently in store for us, according
to Democratic prophecy, during the “good time” that is coming this
next year. We have so frightened ourselves merely by enumerating
them, that we have just sent off to MR. GREEN, to inquire what he will
charge for a twelvemonth’s board and lodging in the Nassau Balloon.
If his charges are not too high, we are thinking it will be just as well
to keep out of the way till 1852 has safely blown over.
The
THE COUNSEL’S TEAR.
IF FARADAY's or LIEBIG's art'
Could crystallise this legal treasure,
Long might a pleader, near his heart,
The jewel wear with chuckling pleasure.
The native brilliant, ere it fell,
A squeeze produced in WALKER's eye,
Which, winking, dropped the liquid “sell,”
The spring of plausibility.
Nice drop of rich and racy light,
In thee the rays of Humour shine;
Almost as queer, all but as bright,
As any gem or joke of mine.
Thou fine effusion of the soul!
That never fail'st to gain relief,
Which barristers can ne'er control,
When thou art like to help their brief:
The farce-wright's and the jester's theme,
In many a joke, on many a stage,
Thou moisten'st CHITTY's arid theme,
And BLACKSTONE's dry and dreary page.
That very lawyer, who a tear
Can shed, as from the bosom's source,
With feeling equally sincere,
Could weep on t'other side—of course.
ALCOHOL SUPERSEDED.
(To the Temperance League.)
Y_ExCELLENT FRIENDs, In the
Times of November 12, you will
find the following passage, under
the heading of Consumption of
SPIRITs;—
“In the nine months ending the 10th of
October, 1850, the quantity of spirits—rum,
brandy, and geneva–was 3,521,938 gallons;
and in the nine months ending the 10th
nlt, the quantity entered for home consump-
tion was 3,449,089 gallons, showing a de-
crease of 72,849 gallons. Less spirits were
consumed during the time the Great Exhi-
bition was open, than in the preceding
year.’
Now here is an instructive fact
for you; my only fear is, that it will
teach you too much, and cause some
of you to make a Great Exhibition
of themselves, for the purpose of
promoting temperance. But the
moderate inference—and, excellent
friends, we should be moderate in
our inferences as well as in our
potations—is, that rational recrea-
tion diminishes tippling. Now then
come, suppose you set to work and
devote your energies to devising
some ºl. for making the world in
general merry in a reasonable way,
upon sober liquor. I don't ask you
to play the fool in demonstrations
and processions, or to stand on your heads, or commit any other
buffoonery on platforms in opposition to public-house principles. I
only ask you to contribute in some sensible way to the amusement
of society; and if you call upon me to name, I say, extend the cir-
culation of my popular periodical, with a view to limit that of the
bottle. If you know any better scheme, candidly impart it; if not,
try this with me; as MR. CockLE says of his pills, in the language of
HoRACE, as if HoRAce were HoRATIUS Cocles, and not FLAccus.
But, however, depend upon this, that when Lord BYRON wrote—
“Man, being reasonable, must get drunk,”
he (being probably in a state of gin himself) meant—
“Man, being miserable, must get drunk."
And your great problem is, to discover an effectual means of keeping
the spirits up without pouring spirits down. In the mean time, I take
leave to repeat, in the place of spirits, take 33UOCº.

AWKWARD CONSEQUENCES OF REMOVING THE SOLDIERS FROM
Housemaid. “If you Please, 'M, Me, AND Cook, AND MARY, wishes to Leave, This Day Month, Ma'am."
THE RESPECTABILITY OF
ST. ALBANS.
“SIR," writes MR. Thomas WARD
BLAGG, Clerk to the Borough Magis-
trates of St. Albans, in a letter to the
Times:-
“In your leading article of Friday last, hav-
ing reference to the St. Albans Bribery Com-
mission, you describe MR. NEPTUNE Srira as
“one of the Borough Magistrates." This is a
mistake, and, as there is a highly respectable
gentleman of the name of SMITH who is a
borough magistrate, it ought to be corrected.”
There is a gentleman of the name
of SMITH who.is highly respectable.
Really, the implication is not very.com-
º MR. NEPTUNE Smith.
EPTUNE is a professor of the art of
self-defence—MR. BLAGG better
look out—and he was employed to
keep the peace at the St. Albans elec-
tions: an object which he accomplished
in general, not by pugilistic force, but
by the persuasion of beer. MR. Nº.
TUNE SMITH at any rate cut as re-
spectable a figure as any witness
who appeared before the Bribery
Commissioners.
It is gratifying, however, to have
MR. BLAGG's assurance that there is
one respectable person connected with
the Borough of St. Albans.
The ER0 or UNGAry.
AN inhabitant of the heart of this
metropolis, hearing the EMPERoR or
Austria called a NERO,...,denied his
Majesty's claim to the title, insisting
that it was KossuTH, and not the
tyrant, who ought to be styled an 'ero.
WESTED INTERESTS IN KNIGHTSBRIDGE
BARRACKS.
(Claimed by the People over the way.)
At a suburban Court of Common Council, convened at the Noted
House for Old Ale, and attended by the majority of the pot-house
keepers, licensed or unlicensed wituallers, and other inhabitants of that
ornamental border of the Knightsbridge Road opposite to the Barracks,
MR. GILLUMs in the chair.
MR. Maxwell, submitted to the court a motion of which he had
iven notice, relative to the proposed removal of *...;
flºº. to make room for a National Gallery. He was sure nobody
there present wouldn't impute what he was .."; to say to interested
motives, for they was all rowin in the same boat (hear), and had but one
object, which was the good of the public. . (Hear, hear.) A proposal
had been started to move the Barricks from over the way (groans).
What for? To build a pictur gallery in the place of 'em—a pictur
gallery, to hold, what they called, the old masters. . He knew nothing
about the old masters, nor old mistresses neither; but this he knew,
that he had the greatest respect and admiration for the British sojer;
and hoped he might never see the day when] that neighbourwoo
should be deprived of the advantages attending on the Life-Guards.
He would move, that this meetin views with serious alarm the idear of
moving Knightsbridge Barricks, the benefits of witch institooshun the
inabitants of this districk have so long enjoyed:...and considers the
attempt to deprive them of the privilege of the military a unjustifiable
interference with their wested rights (cheers).
MR. PEwTERs said he seconded that are motion. He rejected with
scorn the foul himputation that the Barricks was injurious to the morals
of the neighbourin population. He would pledge his reputation for Hot
Elder Cordial to the contrary. He had a family, and if he might, would
send them into the guard-room to take exercise in behaviour (hear,
hear). His firm conwiction was that the atmosphere of the Barricks
was, in a moral pint of view, salubrious. (Much cheering.)
MR. HARDY felt himself compelled to oppose the motion by a sense
of duty. (Oh! Oh!) The British soldier was the finest fellow in the
world, on the field of battle (ironical cheers), but he was the greatest
possible nuisance at the area of domestic life (hisses). By removing the
Barracks from that side of the way, they would remove drunkenness
and debauchery from this. (Tremendous uproar, and cries ºf “Turn him
out!” amid which the speaker resumed his seat.) -- -
MR. Juniper would not sit quiet and hear, sich a unwarantable
stigma throwd on the carrickter of a (respectable row of ouses and
the British Army (cheers). He only wished the gallant fellers as
had bin abused (hear, hear), and the British females as had been
insulted, by that indiwidgle, was now present, and they’d soon teach
him what it was to attempt to black their good names with falsehood.
(Order, order!)
MR. HARDY. I did nothing of the sort (Confusion).
MR. JUNIPER. You did. (Yes, yes! and No.
MR. HARDY. I did not.
MR. JUNIPER. It’s false!
MR. HARDY. If you say that again, I’ll punch your head. (Uproar,
and cries of “Chair /*)
The CHAIRMAN, though he entirely disapproved of MR. HARDy's
remarks, thought, howsomdever, that MR. JUNIPER had come it rayther
too strong... Everybody was free to state his own opinions, never mind
how much they went agin the feelins of the majority.
MR. TAPP said the agitation for movin the Barricks was all the work
of a humbug paper. For his part, he didn't care a dump for the Pres
not he. Who wanted pictures at Knightsbridge Barricks? They h
one picture close by, the picture of a British hero, and that was enough
—he meant the sign of “The Life Guardsman.”—But why fret them-
selves afore there was occasion? There was nothin to be afeard of at
resent; the thing couldn't be done except by Act of Parliament; and
e know'd that the Metropolitan Members would give it their deter.
mined º (Cheers).
MR. JoBBINs, could produce the opinions of several officers and
º that the present site of Knightsbridge Barracks was the very
est that could be chosen for the purpose to which it was now applied
(hear, hear!). There might be some little room for improvement in
the contiguous dwellings, which, if properly attended to, would remov
all objection. He would, if such was the feeling of the meeting, prepare
model of the Barracks and the neighbourhood, with the alterations he
had in view, to be deposited, in some convenient situation, for *:::
inspection. This proposal was received, with loud, cheers, and the
resolution having been put and carried, with but one dissentient
voice, the meeting broke up into several drinking parties.

LOUIS NAPOLEON AND THE ALMANACKS,
very, Almanack maker
has been laying violent
hands upon poor Louis
NAPOLEoN. %. is no
doubt that
“If ZAdkiel's fit to live,
Louis must die.”
Old MooRE seems de-
termined to dispose of the
President in the very first
month of the year, and
ZADKIEL, with scarcely
more consideration, pre-
dicts that “serious trou-
ble seizes on Louis NA-
PoleoN in February, if
he have outlived the
violent influence of last
summer.”
In ordinary cases you
cannot eat your cake
and have it; nor does it
seem reasonable that you
should kill your Presi-
dent and still have him, to
be used in future months
as a subject for future
prophecies. Neverthe-
less, after dooming poor Louis NApoleon to death in January, or
February at latest, he is galvanised for further use in March; and we
are told that in April, Louis NAPOLEoN may now say, “Adieu to all my
Greatness.” How he is to make this meat speech in April, after having
been dead two or three months, is a problem which none but a profes-
sional prophet would be bold enough to attempt the solution of.
It is quite clear that if anything should unfortunately happen, to the
President of the French republic, Old MooRE—though, by the way
there are three Old MooREs—a sixpenny Old Mooke, a twopenny Ol
MooRE, and a Penny MooRE, who is, in fact, a penny less—would be
liable as an accessary before the fact to a very grave accusation.
The hieroglyphic shows a pair of compasses pointing to the portrait
of Louis NAPOLEoN 3 and surely this may be called compassing his
death, when we take it in connexion with the letter-press. It cannot
be a very comfortable thing to have one's death and downfal prophesied
in all directions; but we dare say the President will survive the pre-
dictions, which will be explained away next year by the intimation that
from and after January, Louis NAPOLEoN ceased to be alive—to his
own and his country's interests.
ENCOURAGEMENT TO GRETNA GREEN.
To persons about to marry in the neighbourhood of Manchester, the
Morning Post affords the following important information:–
“THE LAw of MARRIAGE.-The Manchester papers state, that in consequence of
the refusal of the Vicar of Leigh to marry any one who cannot repeat the catechism, or
who has not been confirmed, or become a regular communicant, marriages have ceased
to be solemnised at the parish church, at which previously nearly 200 marriages were
solemnised ; not a single marriage having taken place at Leigh Church during the
quarter from June to September.”
To require submission to an examination in theology of candidates
for marriage, must rather tend to promote morality in the manufac-
turing districts. It is fortunate that there are some churches where
lovers . be united without being obliged to repeat their catechism.
How would such a requisition work in “high life?” What would be
the effect, as regards matrimonial statistics, if the Bishop or LoNDon,
or whoever is the patron, would promote the Vicar of Leigh to St.
George's, Hanover Square ?
National Compliments.
(By our Discontented, Uninformed, Stupid Correspondent.)
THE French certainly understand the art of paying compliments. At
the time of the French Revolution—we mean, at least we think, for we
cannot be sure, but we imagine it was the last one—the word “Royal”
was altered on, all the public buildings to “National.”. Thus, the
“Palais Royal” was changed into “Palais National;”, the “Académie
Royale” into “Opéra National;" and so on, all throughout Paris. This
change, it may not be generally known, was effected out of compliment
to the National newspaper, by whose influence, it will be recollected,
the Revolution was principally effected. We wonder when an English
newspaper will have a similar compliment paid to it?—not until, we are
afraid, there is, in such matters, a very great Revolution in England!
ROMANCE FOR A ROTTEN BOROUGH!
(To be sung by the Free and Independent Voters of St. Albans.)
WAIT, JACOB 1 wait, till again united
The Commons' House you see ;
Then all the vows we boldly plighted,
Abjuring º
Will, there's much ground to fear, be slighted,
And we shall part from thee.
Fare thee well! fare thee well! fare thee well!
We soon shall be crying with sorrow,
JAcob BELL | JAcoB BELL! JAcob BELL!
Ah! Disfranchisement waits us to-morrow—
JAcoB BELL!
Mute, mute, and dumb, as Death's cold valley,
Will be that tuneful scene;
We need not call it Sovereign Alley,
Where those sweet hours have been,
When we were wont to shilly-shally
Two candidates between,
JAcob BELL! JAcob BELL || JAcoB BELL!
Unable on either to settle,
Fare thee well! fare thee well! fare thee well!
Till we heard the sweet chime of thy metal,
JAcob BELL!
Fare thee well!
RIDING AND READING.
Mong the recent “improvements,”
r1 we have to notice the introduc-
tion of books and newspapers into
some of the metropolitan omni-
buses. The plan is certainly a
good one for beguiling many a
weary hour, that would otherwise
hang heavi § upon the passengers
of some of those loitering vehicles,
that make very short journeys,
and very long stoppages. It is
not a bad dodge to put a book
into the hands of an individual,
who, by getting interested in the
contents of a volume, forgets to
ask the conductor when he means
to go on—a query that often leads
- ., to much unpleasantness.
We have had Reading for the Rail—some of which, by the way, seems
adapted for railway sleepers—but we did not expect that literature
would so soon find its way into our street conveyances, and turn every
omnibus into a vehicle, for knowledge. No doubt some enterprising
publisher will speedily be found to bring out a series of works espe:
cially adapted for the use of omnibus travellers, and we would suggest
the following as a few with which to try the experiment:—
An Abridgment of the Crescent and the Cross ; for the use of the
omnibuses from Charing Cross to Burton Crescent.
Lives of the Chancellors ; for the use of CHANCELLOR's Chelsea con-
Veyances.
BUTLER's Geography; as a Companion to every Atlas.
PETERSDORFF's A-bridge-ment ; for the line in connexion with the
London Bridge Railway Station.
Should the º of reading be introduced into the metropolitan
cabs, we should have no hesitation in recommending that every water-
man should be supplied with a complete copy of RANK, and that every
passenger hiring a cab should be entitled to the perusal of LARDNER's
Cab-inet Cyclopædia.
Professor Palmerston.
A, FRENCH paper, taking up LoRD PALMERston's expression of
“judicious bottle-holding,” accuses him of being “an eminent Pro-
fessor of the Art du Bore.” We never heard of his Lordship putting
on the gloves in public, excepting in a political sense; nor are we ex-
actly aware that he is in the habit of figuring in the Ring, unless, per-
chance, it is the one in Hyde Park;-but then French papers are always
so much better informed upon these matters than we are. The only
thing in which we can say for certain that Lord PALMERston exceſs
in Boxing is, in Boxing the Compass of political affairs in Europe,
and we hope he may long continue to be an eminent Professor of that

FUNNY MARKET AND WITTY INTELLIGENCE.
UR news from France
has spread a gloom over
the Funny Market;
and the threatened ex-
clusion of French plays
has created , a, panic
among the dealers in
dramatic stuffs and
small piece-work. As
the burlesque orders
are now in the course
of execution, there has
been a briskness in the
demand for puns of an
average quality; but
the supply is limited
in consequence of a
scarcity of the raw
material. The head of
a well-known facetious
, firm was in the market
# all last week, but there
= were]very few bond fide
transactions, and those
were of an insignificant
character.
Conundrums were heavy, at a fraction lower than the previous rates,
and several hundredweight of damaged puns changed hands at a small
diminution in prices.
An order came in during the day for five thousand articles equal to
the following sample:—
“Why is a man who does not bet, as bad as a man that does?
—Because he’s no better.”
The commission was taken by the respectable firm of WAGG & Co.,
at 2áths, which is somewhat under the old figure.
There, have been one or two small failures in the Funny Market
during the week, but the transactions of the parties were so small, that
their paper had scarcely any circulation. Their chief issue had been in
conundrums, which could not be answered on their being offered for
that purpose. One of these consisted in a demand—
“Why will there be no reason to make a Tunnel in the neighbour-
hood of Islington P’’. An attempt was made to meet this demand in
tiºns desperate manner:-‘‘Because there’s a Holloway there
y - x-
The parties to whom this was offered, refused their acceptance, and
an immediate determination to wind up the concern was arrived at.
It would have been obviously quite impossible to have gone on, with
nothing more solid than this, with which to meet accruing liabilities.
An application is to be made immediately for protection, which is really
much required, as there is much indignation against those involved in
this lamentable failure.
RATHER TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING.
WE see advertised some “Crying Dolls.” We must protest against
this new kind of amusement. , Just as if the real thing was not
enough, but we are to have an addition to an evil, that is already suffi-
ciently “crying ” in every household. We wish the inventor of this
new toy (which might be called “the Disturber of the Peace of
Private Families”) to be woke up regularly in the middle of the night,
for the next twelve months to come, by one of his own “Crying Dolls,”
and then he will be able to see how he likes it! Let one of the joils,
also be “Teething; ” for we should not be astonished now to hear
of “Teething Dolls,” and “Coughing and Choking Dolls,” with other
infantine varieties, and then the punishment of this “monster in
human form” will be complete. DR. GUILLotLNE perished by the
instrument he invented. The inventor of the “Crying Dolls” deserves a
similar fate. He should be shut up with all his toys “in full cry,” until,
like NIOBE, the crying was the death of him, and he was turned, b
some offended mythological Deity, into the “great pump,” of whic
his invention proclaims him to be the effigy.

List to my surprising tale,
Hearken to a wondrous story
More than very like a whale;
Each mesmeric marvel-monger,
Lend to me your ears likewise;
If for miracles you hunger,
You shall ope both mouth and eyes.
. In the ship Ann Alexander,
Cruising in pursuit of whales,
Bold John S. DeBlois, Commander,
With a crew so gallant, sails.
In the South Pacific Ocean,
Reaching to the Off Shore Ground,
*Mong the waves in wild commotion,"
Several monstrous Whales they found.
These two boats did follow after,
Larboard boat, and starboard too,
And with shouts of glee and laughter,
The Leviathans pursue;
When the lal board boat, commanded
By the stout First Mate, did soon
In a Whale, with force strong-handed,
Deeply plunge a sharp harpoon.

PUNCH, OR THE

Off the mighty monster started;
Pain and anguish gave him cause;
Suddenly he backwards darted,
Seized the boat between his jaws;
Into smithereens he cracked it;
Or, as witnesses declare,
Who beheld the thing transacted,
Bits no bigger than a chair!
In the starboard boat, the Captain
uickly to the rescue struck, , .
And, although the bark was snapt in
Pieces, saved the crew—by luck.
Now the good Ann Alexander
To their aid the waist-boat sent;
Half the band then having manned her,
At the Whale again they went.
Soon the ocean-giant nearing,
They prepared to give him fight,
Little thinking, never fearing,
That the beast again would bite.
But without their host they reckon'd;
At their boat he also flew;
Like the first he served the second,
Snapped it into pieces too.
Sure his jaws, together clapping,
Had the gallant seamen crushed; .
But, when they perceived him snapping,
Straight into the sea they rushed.
To afford the help they needed,
Bold DEBLOIs repaired again;
Once more, also, he succeeded
In the aim to save his men.
Tired, perhaps, of sport renewing,
To their ship this time they hied,
When, behold, the Whale pursuing,
With his jaws extended wide.
Gloating with revenge, he sought 'em ;
But, with blubber pierced, and gored,
He was crippled, or had caught 'em ;
But they all got safe on board.
Risk the heroes little cared for;
§. they set their sail
In the ship herself—prepared for
One more tussle with the Whale. -
Now they reach'd him—plunged a lance in
The infuriate monster's head; -
Then—of course they had no chance in
Close encounter-onward sped.
For the ship they saw him making,
But the chase he soon gave o'er,
Which the animal forsaking,
Down on him again they bore;
Fif§ rods below the water
There they saw the monster lie;
So, despairing him to slaughter,
They resolved no more to try.
At this time, DEBLoſs was standing
Sternly on the larboard bow,
Ready, with harpoon his hand in,
To inflict a deadly blow:
Up he saw the monster rising,
ith velocity and power,
At the rate of speed surprising
Of full fifteen knots an hour!
In an instant—Heaven defend us!—
Lo, the Whale had, near the keel
Struck, with such a force tremendous,
That it made the vessel reel;
And her bottom knock’d a hole in,
Into which the water pour’d;
And the sea so fierce did roll in,
That the billows rush'd and roar'd!
Yet the ship was saved from sinking,
Though so riddled by the Whale,
And DEBLoſs and his unshrinking
Crew, survive to tell the tale.
Strong are all those daring fellows,
Doubtless, the harpoon to throw:
And—to judge from what they tell us-
Stronger still to draw the bow!

JOHN BULL, TAKE CARE OF YOUR POCKETS.
The United States seem to be getting united into one state, which
is likely to be a state of bankruptcy. The model republic is so fond of
freedom, that America takes every opportunity of throwing off its
º: ; and in repudiating its bonds, it repudiates the liability to pay the
interest.
New Orleans has just joined the repudiating fraternity, in conse-
quence of the municipal authorities having got up a quarrel, as certain
parties sometimes get up a fight, to give an opportunity of picking the
pockets of the bystanders. Until the authorities have settled their dis-
putes, they will not think of settling their debts; and as the Americans
owe everything to England, they appear desirous of letting what they
owe remain as a standing obligation, which they are not disposed to cancel.
We have heard much of the banks of Ohio; but the bank of I.O.U. is
that which appears to be most in character with the transactions on the
other side of the Atlantic.

Master Butcher. “THEN, cut Miss WIGGLEs's ShouldeR AND NEck, AND HANG MR.

THE TYRANTS OF THE CAB-STAND.
| A PowerFUL sensation has been created in
the Metropolis by the announcement of a panic
having seized upon a would-be public benefactor,
who, having announced his intention to start
some cabs at sixpence a mile, was for some time
deterred by the threats of a selfish whipocracy,
consisting of men of that particular rank, known
as the cab-rank. We must confess we always
thought there was a degree of unnecessary
nervousness in the mind of that man who could
be intimidated by the idea that his horses would
be maimed in their stables, his drivers murdered
in the public streets, and his innocent fares mas-
sacred in the midst of a sixpenny drive in the
Metropolitan thoroughfares.
We do not anticipate any further mischief
from the establishment of sixpenny cabs, than
an increased interchange of that “chaff” which
forms the circulating medium of the intellectual
resources of the cab-driving community. We are
aware that anything new in the shape of a public
conveyance turns every opposition vehicle into a
vehicle of abuse; but we must be prepared to
stand a few personal allusions, for the sake of a
beneficial change, until it ceases to be a novelty
—when even a cabman will grow tired of making
insulting comments. As the Protectionist party
has nearly dwindled away, we might, suggest a
reinforcement by a coalition with the Protec-
tionist cabmen, which would at least introduce
the element of vigour that is so much required. |
A Pleasant Neighbour.
AMong the new publications recently adver-
tised in France is “The Criminal History of
the English Government, from its Massacre ºf
the Irish to its Poisoning of the Chinese.” This
must be an entertaining volume, and would, at
all events, possess one charm for the English
reader—the charm of novelty.
One who Will Swallow anything.
SINCE the performance of the Boa Constrictor
in swallowing the blanket, MR. FERRAND has
written it a letter full of compliments, saying “he
has had great pleasure in enrolling it as a
member of the Wool-Ireague.” The º:
reptile has not been well since the receipt of
the letter.
“OLD PAM,” ALIAS “THE DOWNING
STREET PET,”
- (THE WELL-KNowN JUDICIOUs Bottle-holdeR.)
IN presenting our readers with a portrait of this celebrated sporting
character, we have no intention of going into a detailed account of
his performances in the Diplomatic ring.
e may be strictly called “a veteran; ” but he has been such a
remarkably steady man, and, thanks to this, is still so fresh, and in such
good preservation, that no one would think of clapping on his head
more than two-thirds of the sixty-seven years he carries with so much
pluck and liveliness. -
“OLD PAM,” as he is affectionately called by the nobs of the Fancy,
with whom he is deservedly a great favourite, entered the ring in the
good old milling times, when a fight was a fight, and no mistake.
Boney the bruiser was still open to fight all the world, any weight, size,
or odds, and PAM made his bow in St.Stephen's, the Tennis Court of
those days, just after Boney's great mill with “the Prussian,” which
came off in Austerlitz Fields, and on the event of which so much
changed hands. -
PAM was trained in the sharp fast-hitting school of poor GeoRGE
CANNING—that brilliant favourite of the Fancy. The style of this
school, though very showy, was rather deficient in “slogging,” and
punishing qualities, and PAM early showed considerable judgment in
|
combining with the neat sharp countering of the CANNING school, a
good deal of the straight-forward go-in-and-win-style, which never fails to
insure a man backers in England.
It is not, however, as a fighting man, but as a second, and still more
as a bottle-holder, that PAM is distinguished. He is great in arranging
the preliminaries of a mill, though some have complained that there is
a good deal of bounce about him, and that as a backer he is not to be |
trusted, being apt to desert his own man at the last moment, and hedge.
It was no doubt a good deal owing to PAM's services that the “Constan- |
tinople Slasher” (whom PAM both backed and acted as bottle-holder to)
ained his victory over “Old Egypt” in 1840; when “Little Thiers,” who
#. the needful in the same way for “Old Egypt,” was such a loser, that
he quite lost his temper in the field, and wanted to make a match to
fight PAM in the same ring. However, PAM never lost his good-
humour with the little fellow, whose tendency to chaff was well known;
and nothing serious ever came of it. ...
PAM was very busy in 1847, arranging the preliminaries of a mill
between Johnny BULL and the late Lewis Phil LIPs, on the occasion
of the latter entering into a match with “The Don,” contrary, to his
engagement with Johnny. Many, however, thought that neither he
nor GUIzot, who acted as PHILLips's “friend” on the occasion, ever
meant fighting, and that neither one nor the other could have made the
necessary deposits, though they both talked º - - -
PAM is always to be found in his own well-known sporting crib in
Downing Street, where most of the matches and fights to come are
negotiated. Recently there has been a good deal of talk about an

THE “JUDICIOUS BOTTLE-HOLDER ;”

247
affair of unparalleled interest, to come off between two well-known
heavy-weights, “Nick the Bear” and “Young Europe,” in which both
sides have applied to PAM; who has always hitherto been looked upon
as a backer of the latter, and who, if he has any regard for his own
character and that of his establishment, will certainly have nothing to
say to Nick's backers, who have always patronised a rival house. e
trust that wherever PAM appears as bottle-holder, it will be on the right
side, assured, as we are, that this is the only way in which he can
continue to merit the support of his friends and the public.
We have nothing to say against him, unless it be that he certainly is
open to the charge of occasionally bullying men that he thinks can’t
stand up to him, and that when he wants to get up a mill, he is not
always careful enough about the character of the man he backs.
Thus, in “PACIFIco’s” fight with “the Greek,” when PAM backed
the Jew, it was felt by many that PAM did not deal quite fairly; and
that though the battle-money was paid over to the Jew, “the Greek”
would certainly have won, had PAM gone quite “upon the square.”
As a companion, PAM is a great favourite—great at chaff, sings a
d song, and is seen to great advantage at the harmonic ordinary in
t. Stephen's, Westminster, where he is the life and soul of the table,
and where in the sparring soirées, for which the House is so celebrated
“the Downing Street Pet,” despite his seven-and-sixty summers, is still
one of the quickest and neatest hands with the gloves that ever step
on a stage. His performance, on the occasion of his own benefit, last
season, was an example of perfect, science; his quickness in stopping,
his sharpness in countering, and, above all, his style of getting away
from his man, were considered worthy of the best days of the
Parliamentary Ring.
A BEAUTIFUL CLOSING SCENE.
UR province is not to deal
with melancholy subjects.
To brighten, not to dim,
the eye; to elevate, not
to depress, the angles of the
mouth; to excite concus-
sions of the sides, rather
than suspirato move-
ments of the chest ; to
titillate in the ribs, rather
than to touch the heart; is
our business; or, to adopt
the language of Genius,
(supposing itself heaven-
born) our Mission. Three-
pence – fourpence, stamp
inclusive – is more than
mankind are inclined to
pay for being made miser-
able. Few customers would
be found for three penn'orth of melancholy. Closing scenes, therefore,
are subjects which, for the most part, we eschew, And yet there is
one Closing Scene on which we might dilate to the pleasure of many
readers, especially some of the gentler sex, to whom such a scene would
afford the sight of a husband's—a father's face, for a few short hours,
by daylight, once in a week, besides on Sundays. The Closing Scene
we allude to is the scene of Wholesale Warehouses closing at 3 P.M.,
which might be managed by letting those employed in them work
continually up to that hour, instead of dining at one.
LOUIS NAPOLEON AT ALL IN THE RING.
IT seems as if all the great events of modern history are destined to
acted as “scenes in the circle” of an equestrian establishment. The
Cirque in the Champs Elysées, and Astley's at the foot of Westminster
Bridge, are the two localities in which the great historical dramas of
the world are now being performed. Louis NAPQLEoN distributes
crosses of the Legion of Honour in the Parisian Qirque, just as his
illustrious uncle—in the person of GomERsAL—made field-marshals amid
the sawdust of Astley’s. Both establishments possess an interest far
beyond the mere acts of equestrianism for which they were originally
designed; and, in fact, history and politics must have come down to a
somewhat low pitch, when their principal arena is ordinarily an arena
for horsemanship. It must be said for ourselves, that in England we
§ give the dramatic versions of history at our Amphitheatres; while
in France, they are the places in which the great events of national
interest actually take place; but it will be long before the chief of our
executive is found addressing the public from the “ring,” as the President
of the French Republic has been recently doing.
Vot(E)ARIEs or MAMMON.—The Electors of St. Albans.
LITERARY INTELLIGENCE,
(ExCLUSIVE.)
ANxious to maintain our supremacy as the leading literary journal
of the day, we are happy to announce that, at an utter recklessness of
expense, we have secured the services of an eminent clairvoyant, with
whose prophetic revelations we shall occasionally startle the literary
world. By means of a powerful Mesmeric Telescope he has recently
invented, SAM WELLER's great ocular feat of “seein’ thro' a pair o'
stairs and a 2-inch deal board,” will be readily accomplishable; and the
walls of Grub Street become as transparent as those of the Crystal
Palace itself. Indeed, it is confidently º: that the ligneo-
º: qualities of the instrument may be ultimately brought to
r upon the heads, as well as the houses, of our publishing friends;
so that not merely their actual doings, but their cerebral half-fledged
intentions also, will be clearly visible to the eye of “Our Own Clair-
voyant.” We shall thus be enabled re ly to anticipate the
preliminary puffs of the newspapers; and, in short, indulge our
rivileged readers with a frequent insight into the middle of the
iterary next week.
Our readers must have a little r. however, of course. Such
an indulgence cannot be lightly granted—like a Pope's. It were,
obviously, childish to expect that so novel an appliance of mesmeric
mechanism should be reduced to perfect working order, as readily as a
rolling-pin, or one of the stereotypical hippodramas at Astley's. We
may, however, state, by way of whale-tub to the curious, that we were
invited to a trial of its powers the other day, when several highly
interesting experiments were effected, with a success that encourages
us to hope our fullest expectations may soon be realised. For the
º: we must content ourselves with laying before our readers a
rief statement of the facts already elicited as a sample, in some sort,
of what they may hereafter expect.
The first experiment we made was upon the House of a well-known
publisher in Gr-t M-rlb–rgh Street; where, by applying our mental
eye to the small extremity of the instrument, we clearly discerned the
proof sheets of a new novel by the Author of Ravenscliffe, somewhat
similarly entitled, Rooksrocke; while, at an adjoining press, the com-
positors were busily employed in setting up The #J. Bricks; a
Tale of Ideal Life—induced, no doubt, by the very favourable reception
awarded to The Livingstones. We also thought we perceived, in the
hands of one of the attendant demons of the place, a new historical
work called, France as it used to was—probably emanating from the
pen which . gave us Spain as it is.
We then took the liberty of dragging MR. B–NTL–Y's generally
well-stocked preserves; but all we could fish out here was The Tittlebat,
a small duodecimal fraction of MR. HERMAN MELVILLE's Whale; in
whose wake it is probably intended to follow. A peep at No. 22,
Albemarle Street, however, proved decidedly more fortunate. Besides
a whole host of tricoloured additions to the shelves of our circulating
libraries (of which we shall only notice The Spermaceti Sorcerer, as being,
we think, a gross titular plagiary upon The Amber hitch), our telescope
distinctly revealed the accepted M.S. of a Pamphlet, quaintly entitled,
“And Betty Martin:" a Sequel to “All my Eye; ” which our readers
will have no difficulty in ascribing to the same eccentric hand, or rather
head, to which we are indebted for the Bubbles that burst upon us a
few years since, as well as the Stokers and Pokers that have sub-
sequently made such a stir in literary circles.
We next popped in, like a mesmeric PAUL PRy, upon the MessRs.
L–NGM-N's establishment; but, although we strained our telescopic
º to the utmost, we regret to * we could discover no signs of
MR. MACAULAY's Third at present. It is needless to add, that on
leaving these great “Leviathans of the Row,” we encountered
numerous shoals of small five-shilling fry, whose bright red backs and
golden sides proclaimed them of the ordinary Christmas species. We
shall not waste our valuable space in more explicit nominal disclosure,
as the newspapers will so soon save us the trouble. We may as
well just mention, however, that we see no prospect, as yet of an
American sequel to The Cricket on the Hearth, under the title of The
Hockey on the Hobbs.
From this slight prospective sketch, our readers will see they need
fear no lack of literary novelty this Christmas, if our telescopic
prognostications be verified. And, for the sake of our prophetic
reputation, we hope they may.
Moles Indigesta.
THERE is no truth in the report that Count MoLE has any idea of
joining the Republican party in Paris. Though the Count occupies a
high position, he wishes the distinction to be preserved between the
Conservative Mole hill and the Socialist Mountain.

MRs. BAKER is awaiting the arrival of ScAMP from Regent Street, and of MR. B.
from the City–with more anariety, it must be confessed, for the dog than the
husband. The table is laid for dinner. A ring is heard at the back door.
Enter MARY.
Mary. Please, M, it’s a man with a dog; he says he’s to wait.
Mrs. Baker. Oh yes! it's a dog I bought to-day. Ask him to bring it in.
Mary (at the door, to MR. CHIFFINs, outside). If you’ll step this way.
Enter MR. CHIFFINs, bringing in with him a strong smell of dog, and anise-seed. He
carries. ScAMP under his arm. He pauses on the door-mat, and touches his
forelock respectfully.
Mrs. Baker. Oh! you’ve brought the dog. It was to be twenty-five shillings,
I think.... [Produces her purse, and pays the money.
Mr. Chiffins. Thankee, Marm. It’s giving on him away.
[Releases ScAMP, who instantly takes refuge between his legs, [and growls at
MRs. B. in the most unprovoked and bitter manner.
Mrs. Baker. Good dog, good dog'. Here, ScAMP, ScAMPy! poor fellow! poor
fe—ll—ow! [Insinuatingly. ScAMP continues his hostile demonstration.
Mr. Chiffins. E.'s * Marm; but they ’re a werry affectionate dawg where
they takes, spannels is. Now, then, a done, will yer—and go to the lady, can't yer?
[Introduces him to MRs. B. by a sharp kick, which MRs. B. feels keenly.
Mrs. Baker. How can you, man? Here, poor fellow! poor fellow ! (Sternly to
MR. CHIFFINs) I did mean to have ordered you some beer, but I shall not do so, in
consequence of your brutality.
Mr. Økiffins; Bless you, Marm, one must be sharp with them, nows and thens.
He couldn't abide to part with me, if I made much on 'im, pretty cretur !
pººr (appeased). Well, that’s true. Here, MARY, give this good man a
glass 01 ale.
-: Mr. Chiſſins (touching his forelock again). Thankee, Marm, and I wish you joy on
come to me, Marm, JEM CHIFFINs, Kensal New
Padd’ngton; and I dessay I shall find him for yer,
or another.
[As MR. CHIFFINs retires, ScAMP makes a violent rush
after him. MR. ChIFFINs kicks him back into the
Dining-room. ScAMP indulges in a prolonged howl
of blendedſ". and pain.
Mrs. Baker (much moved by this display of feeling in the
animal). Poor fellow ! did it cry after its master? There,
then-here, good dog!
[ScAMP retreats under a remote article of furniture,
and howls in a subdued manner, obstinately refusing
to meet MRs. BAKER's advances. MRs. BAKER
consoles herself by the reflection, that he certainly is
a dog of very strong affections, and commences a
vigorous course of endearment, to which ScAMP makes
no response beyond alternate whining and growling.
The clock in the Lobby strikes half-past five.
Mrs. Baker. Half-past. BAKER will be home directly.
[Rings the Bell.
Enter MARY.
Mrs. Baker. You may tell Cook to dish the dinner.
[Erit MARY, leaving the door open behind her.
MR. BAKER's latch-key is heard in the lock, followed
by his step in the Lobby. As he closes the door
behind him, ScAMP rushes out from his retreat, and
planting himself in the Dining-room doorway, com-
mences an inſuriated assault of barks and springs,
meant for the inoffensive and astonished BAKER, but
which have all the appearance of being directed
against MARy, who is entering at the moment with
the dinner-plates. MARY drops the plates, smash-
ing two, and begins screaming. ScAMP ercited by
the row, redoubles his barks, and bounds to and fro
upon the door-mat.
Mr. Baker (faintly heard through the tumult). What the
devil’s all this? Whose is that dog?
Mrs. Baker (to ScAMP). Be quiet, Sir–lie down, there’s
a good dog! How dare you, ScAMP lie down this instant "
Mr. Baker (seizing an umbrella from the stand, makes a
wild blow at ScAMP, who retires terror-stricken under his
remote article of furniture). What the deuce is that dog?
(To MARy, sharply.) What are you shaking at, you silly goose?
Two of the white dinner-plates gone! -
Mary (agitated). Oh! it was the dog jump at me—
and I can't a-bear 'em.
Mrs. Baker. It’s the new dog, my dear, that I bought
to-day. You know you said it, was very unsafe, with the
buildings going on all about, and that fair near Notting Hill,
and I thought we had better have a house-dog.
Mr. Baker (impatiently). Well! well! have a house-dog ;
but let him be kept in the yard.
Mrs. Baker. Qh4 he's strange, yet, but he’ll soon know
us, and then he’ll be quite a companion for me while you’re
in the City. - - - -
Mr. Baker (who is of a peace-loving disposition and punctual
habits, cashier to a City bank, and usually submissive in his
home). Very well, my dear, I've no objection; only 1 must
protest against being worried in this way, every time I come
into my own house. -
Mrs. Baker. Oh! that won’t occur again, I’m sure. Here,
ScAMP, speak to master, there’s a good dog!
[ScAMP, who is accessible to kindness . all, gradually
ventures the fore part of his person from under the
article of furniture, and begins a close and suspicious
obserration of MR. and MRs. BAKER, which, at last
emboldens him to walk round MR. BAKER, and smell
his boots very curiously, to the great delight of
MRs. BAKER. -- - -
Mrs. Baker. There—you see, my dear, he's quite friendly
already. What a very intelligent eye he has
Mr. Baker (who is not quite sure whether ScAMP may not
have a design on his calves—uneasily). Yes, yes! but I must
say I think he would be better in the yard.
Mrs. Baker. Oh! when once he knows us, we may keep
him anywhere; but I think we’d better let him get used
to us first before we put him out.
Mr. Baker. Very well, my dear; and now do let's have
dinner, for it’s getting on for six, and I can't bear to wait,
you know. -
[MRs. BAKER rings for dinner. The meal is placed on
the table, and proceeds in the usual way.
Mrs. Baker (who has been assiduously putting aside bones
and scraps during her meal, now adds potatoes and bread).
Town,
someows

going to put it on her plate.) No, here, please. (Presents the plate with the
mess intended for ScAMP.) Here, ScAMP, º: fellow, come here !
Mr. Baker. Now, my dear, you’d really better not feed the dog here—
he’ll dirty all the carpet. It’s a nasty habit. I can’t bear having
animals fed at table.
Mrs. Baker (insidiously). Oh, | dear, he’s strange, you know, now;
when he knows us, they can feed him in the kitchen.
[Puts down the plate. ScAMP immediately nuzzles into it, thrusting
the greater part of the contents on the carpet, and then selecting
the largest bone, carries it off to the centre of the hearth-rug, and
commences gnawing it, with the aid of his fore-paws. -
Mr. Baker (sharply). Now, look at the dirty beast, greasing the
hearth-rug. It’s really very nasty (testily).
Mrs. Baker (cajolingly). Well, my dear, he’s strange now. We’ll
teach him better when he knows us a little. -
[ScAMP, having gnawed his bone bare, returns to the plate, and begins
scattering the contents under the table, in an apparent embarrass-
ment between morsels of nicely-balanced attractiveness.
Mr. Baker. Now, there, all under the table—fat, and potatoes, and
things: one won't be able to walk across the room without treading it
into the carpet.
Mrs. Baker (to the old tune). Oh, my dear, he’s strange, you know.
Wery tenderly.) Oh, you º to spill the things on the carpet.
(ScAMP pauses, to look MRs. BAKER in the face, and wags his tail
gratefully.) I declare he seems getting quite attached already. Do
look, my dear—he's wagging his tail, I declare.
r. Baker (between his teeth). Dirty beast! (He perceires that MRs.
BAKER, absorbed in the dog, has quite forgotten the duties ºf the dinner-
table.—Sternly.) Are you going to help that pudding, MRs. BAKER
Mrs. Baker. Oh, I beg your pardon, my love (helps him.—Musingly.)
I º; he won’t eat sweet pudding *
r
Baker (puts down his fork violently, for him). Really, my dear, IIT
must insist on your not making the experiment.
[Dinner proceeds and concludes—much interrupted by MRs. BAKER's
vivā voce studies of canine character.
Enter MARy, to take away.
Mr. Baker (whose dinner has not been a great success). And ...; bring
in a dust-pan and a broom, and sweep up the mess that dog's been
making under the table.]

[A lapse of four hours; , during which MR. BAKER, after several
attempts to read, which have been utterly defeated by MRs.
BAKER’s conversation with ScAMP, has given himself up to a
snooze in his arm-chair, leaving MRs. BAKER to a tête-à-tête
with her four-legged friend, which has been amazingly successful
in all but MRs. BAKER’s efforts to kindle an enthusiasm on the
subject of the dog in MR. BAKER, like that which she is already
giving fearful way to.
Mr. Baker (waking up). Well, my dear, I think it’s about time for
bed. (Rings.)
Enter MARY, with bed-candles.
Mr. Baker (taking his candle). Are you coming, my dear?
Mrs. Baker (pausing). Directly, my love. . By-the-bye, about the dog
—I suppose you wouldn't like him to sleep in our bed-room?
Mr. Baker (breaking out, and peremptorily). Certainly not; I’ll put
him out into the yard. A -

this, and while he’s strange to the place, too ! Oh! it’s cruel; it
really is quite cruel! - -

dear. In fact, I won't allow of his staying in-doors—he can go into
the knife-house, if he's cold. Come here, you brute! (He roughly seizes
the unhappy ScAMP by the neck, and proceeds to carry his intentions into
execution.)
Mrs. Baker (to herself). Well! I never thought MR. BAKER a hard-
hearted man, before. [She retires in a saddened mood.

room of MR. and MRs. BAKER.
Mrs. Baker (in bed, and after a long interval of silence, during which
the subject has been fermenting in her mind). Yes, MR. BAKER, you
really ought to be ashamed of yourself, turning that poor dumb animal
out of the house into the cold!
[A prolonged howl heard under the window, which looks on the back-
yard, shows that ScAMP is of the same way of thinking.
Mr. Baker. It’s that d-d dog.

Mr. Baker (furning restlessly over, and drawing the counterpane over
his ears). Confound the noisy brute!

longed shake in c above the line. . * * * * A lapse of several
hours, during which MR. BAKER's broken slumbers are made
miserable by the continuous and agonising wail of his victim.
to which MRs. BAKER, who is equally prevented from sleeping,
listens with a mixture of malicious satisfaction and pity. The
windows of the neighbours are heard violently lifted, and slammed
down savagely at intervals.
WHAT’S THE USE OF THE GAZETTEP)
SoMEBODY has lately asked the question, whether there is any par-
ticular use in continuing that celebrated periodical called the London
Gazettef which it is admitted, on all hands, that nobody ever looks
into. As a newspaper, it may be worth preserving, as a curiosity in
these days; for a journal without leading articles, without reviews,
without dramatic notices, without accidents or offences, without police
reports, and, indeed, without everything in the shape of information or
instruction, is to the newspaper press what Hamlet, with the part of
Hamlet left out, is to the drama.
The Editor of the London Gazette must be a very remarkable indi-
vidual; and, indeed, we know of no journal, except our old friend,
Lloyd's List, that can be at all put in competition with it. The literary
staff of Lloyd's List do occasionally get an opportunity of showing what
they can do with the pen, for they are suffered now and then to grow
eloquent upon the state of the wind; but the corps of the London
Gazette can never be permitted to make a remark on any subject
whatever.
If the publication is to be continued, we think something ought to
be done to render it amusing; and we would suggest, therefore, that
the Bankrupts should be done in blank verse; that a man should be
permitted to declare his insolvency in a song, or that a lively duet,
with original music, should be the medium of announcing a dissolution
of partnership. Ünless something is done to give vitality to the London
Gazette, it must eventually die away; for a journal, with nobody to write
it, and nobody to read it, is an anomaly in literature which cannot long
exist in the present advanced state of society.
OUR CITY AND OUR COALS.
As coals supply the wherewithal for the civic improvements, it is
not, perhaps, too much to say, that the Corporation's new buildings
will be rubbishing affairs; seeing that the principal material to be
employed in their construction will be Wall's É.
The Great Fire of London stands every chance of being repeated;
for, instead of rendering their architecture fire-proof, as modern science
would enable them to do, the City authorities are rearing their edifices
out of coals.
Within a circle extending twenty miles round London, the cry is,
that the º Barge is a mere coal-barge, and ought to be scuttled.
It is also loudly declared that the brightest jewel in the crown of the
City monarch is a black diamond.
In fine, the general opinion is, that the LoRD MAYOR and Aldermen
must be called over the coals.
Don't do it Again.
WE understand the hackney and job interest in the Celestial Empire
would oppose any proposition for º on the ground that if the
system were to be adopted, there would be no Co(a)ch-in-China
required.

COURT GRAMMAR.
Considering the attention paid to science and education by the
highest personages in the realm, we think that similar respect should be
shown by those about the Court to the ordinary rules of grammar. We
fear there is a little laxity in these matters among some of the Court
functionariesi, and we have been a great deal puzzled by the following
copy of a letter from one of the equerries of Her Majesty, which is

THE REIGN OF TERROR IN WESTMINSTER HALL.
It will soon be necessary to add a policeman to the more dignified
paraphermalia of practice attached to the Superior Courts in West-
minster Hall. In every case where plaintiff and defendent are ex-
amined, there is almost certain to be contradictory evidence; and as the
jury cannot decide in favour of both, the unhappy individual who fails
in getting a verdict, is at once packed off to º QUEEN’s Prison for
º Of course, if there should be a new trial, and a new jury
should happen to give a new verdict, the unsuccessful party in the
second action would share the fate of the unsuccessful party in the first
action; and plaintiff and defendent may both find themselves under a
charge of perjury. It is true enough that one must be wrong, but then
the ºther must be right; and until it is reducible to a moral certainty,
which is wrong and which is right, a committal for perjury may fall to
the lot of an innocent man. -
Juries are not infallible in their estimate of the value of evidence,
though it is, certainly, their sole province to decide upon it, and the
judges can only be guided by the verdict in presuming where the perjury
lies. Their lordships are bent º: earnestly ontesting the “working”
of the new law, which, seems likely to cause a deal of additional
working at the Central Criminal Court. Scarcely a day passes, during
the sittings at Nisi Prius, on which some unfortunate party to a civil
suit is not packed off to the QUEEN’s Prison—unless sureties are at
hand-on a criminal charge.
... The judicial practice lately entered upon is emergetic; but we fancy
it is somewhat new, for when conflicting testimony proceeded from the
mouths of ordinary witnesses, it was not, we think, usual to convict for
*"... witness, against the tenor of whose evidence a verdict may
have been returned. "Westminster Hall's already pretty barren of
business; but we may expect a further diminution under the new
system; for no man, who has not the fullest confidence in the infal-
libility of a lº will run the risk of being put into a witness-box, though
he has the fullest desire to speak the º
exposed in the window of a West End pastry-cook:-
* MR. is commanded by the QUEEN to thank MR. M'Intyre for the cake of
gingerbread, baked by his own hands, which accompanied his letter."
Now, according to this intimation, it appears that MR. M'INTYRE's
own hands possess all the baking properties of an oven, and that such
hands, being curiosities in their way, he has actually sent them for
inspection to HER MAJESTY. Such is the only interpretation that can,
consistently with the rules of grammar, be put upon the equerry's
phrase, “his own hands which accompanied his letter.” ... We could
understand a man's forwarding his legs by parcels’ delivery if he
happened to wear cork instead of real; but we have never heard of
moveable hands as belonging to ºf but a clock, and we call upon
MR. M'INTYRE to lay his hand upon his heart and teilus how the letter
of the equerry can be accounted for. We have heard of people turning
of old hands and taking on new, but we cannot understand such a feat
with the hands as has been attributed to the ingenious confectioner.
THE POLICEMAN’S HOME.
Up courts and round palaces long they may roam,
But ancient policemen have no sort of home
To offer them shelter, and comfort, and care,
The curbstone no more when their highlows can wear.
Home! home they’ve no home: -
For poor old Policemen there’s no place like home!
The Great Exhibition a surplus has stored;
And surely its funds could a trifle afford,
That body to help in their age and distress,
Who did such a deal to achieve its success.
Home! &c.
The World’s might have been like a Donnybrook Fair,
In case the Police had not managed things there;
A sharp look-out keeping, for ruffians and knaves,
Who wisely stopp'd out of the way of their staves.
Home 1 &c.
Our Force, too, whose gallantry, sorely malign'd,
Isfancied to areas and kitchens confined,
Behaved with such º attention and grace,
They charm'd all the ladies who went to the place.

They tell us how promptly would Z., X, or A.,
Inform them, direct them, or show them the way:
When tired, bring them chairs; call their cab from the stand,
Ortake them safe over the road by the hand.
Home! &c.
Then let a snug Station await Life’s decline,
When once sturdy fists must their truncheons resign;
Andere his worn frame is consign'd to the loam,

An Old Maid's Question.
We see there is an “ANIMAL Assurance Society.” This must be
a prosperous concern, if, amongst the animals whose lives are assured,
it numbers many Cats, as it is very well known that every Cathas nine

eight dearly-beloved Toms, would have to pay for seventy-two policies—
unless the Society consented to make a slight reduction upon its taking
so large a quantity.

THE MODERN GODIVA.
|
I waited for a Dean Street lecturer;
I sat among the nutshells in the pit,
Watching the table and the water-bottle;
And shaped a modern legend into this.
Not only we, the tyrants of the world—
We men, that for the flying of their wheels,
§ down the passed and passing omnibuses
When we cross streets—have loved our trousers well
And loathed to see them oversplashed; but she
Did more, and underwent, and overcame ;
The woman of a thousand miles away,
AMELIA, wife to that grim Colonel, who
Was ris far West; for, when the drapers brought
Their bills for dress and fixings for his wife,
He laid his heels upon the mantelpiece,
And said: “You critters, if I pay, darn me!”
She sought her lord and found him, where he spat
Before the fire, inverted and alone.
His boots six feet above him, and his hair
A yard behind i she told him of her tears,
And pleaded: “If I wear these tucks, they must
Go *:::::: in the mud, and so get torn;
You didn't ought to have your dander ris
By such as these.”—“Then cut 'em off,” he said;
*I guess you won't do that.”—“Alas!” she said,
“But prove me what it is I would not do.”
Then, riled as rough as any 'coon, he said
“You walk in trousers thro' our city, and
I’ll pay it, slick!” and then expectorating,
He whittled, as in scorn, his rocking-chair.
Then fled she to her dressing-room, and there
Untied the knotted shackles of her form—
The grim man's gift—and severed one full breadth;
Nor lingered; looking like a semi-man,
Half clad in skirts; anon she shook her dress,
And shower'd the flowing flounces to her knee.
* -- * * +
Then she walk’d forth, clothed on with pºttiloons:
The loafers stared upon her as she walk’d;
And all the while she scarcely breathed for fear.
The little foul-mouth'd boys along the street
Had cunning eyes to see the unwonted ankles;
But she through all bore "; till last she saw
A rush of cabs come thick from off the stand;
So she rode back, clothed on with pettiloons.

THE THOMPSON TESTIMONIAL.
RICHARD THOMPson is a man of whom we should say, that he has
well deserved of the commonwealth, because he has started sixpenny
cabs, and thereby reduced the common expenditure twenty-five per cent.
The idea of a Thompson Testimonial naturally presents itself as a
tribute due to a great public benefactor; and a statue of the hero,
mounted on his box, would at once confer a graceful compliment on
him, and an elegant ornament on the Metropolis, if placed on the enta-
blature of Hyde Park Gate, opposite to the Burton Arch, where it would
natch admirably with the equestrian figure of the DUKE of WELLINGTON.
| Expense, however, is the wet blanket which envelopes the ideal
sculpture. The present of a whip has been proposed; but in the opinion
of most . the whip would be more deservedly given to the extor-
|tionate insolent rascals, whom Thompson, it is to be hoped, will run
down. On the whole, we believe that a Sixpenny testimonial will best
answer the purpose; to be quietly presented after a ride in one of
|MR. Thompson's vehicles, all the drivers of which will be empowered to
receive subscriptions.

EFFECT OF THE SUB-MARINE TELEGRAPH.
WE have received a letter (we regret to say an unpaid one) from
Boulogne, complaining of what the writer calls our “indecorous exulta-
tion” about the Sub-marine Telegraph. He argues, that unpleasant
facilities will be given to some people for interfering with other people
by this invention.
“A dreary sea now flows between,”
says he, quoting CoIERIDGE. But soon the magic wire may be made
the means of ensnaring the captive, who, under the old state of things
could escape to a wild freedom. The lightning flash from a dun woul
certainly have a thundering effect on the unhappy debtor, and he would
find himself followed, through fire and water, in a very literal manner.
Surely, our correspondent does not expect that the progress of science

Hazardous Descent of Louis Napoleon.
THE other morning-says the Parisian correspondent of the Times—
“the President of the Republic descended into the streets.” This may
be said to be climbing the ladder of ambition the wrong way. Descents
of this kind are not only dangerous in themselves, but they furnish a
precedent to the party, of disorder. By-the-by, our French, friends
should not complain of the smoke of London; it is better to have the
Blacks descend into the streets than the Reds.

It was full moon’s full moonlight! The Shilling
I had paid down at the Gate,
Seemed hung in Heaven. To Newton's Eye
(As Master of the Mint.) ......
A Splendid, yeaCelestial Shilling!
I was alone, with Nothing to Speak of
But Creation! -
Yes! Gigantic Noah's Ark of twenty times her

My heart fluttered as tho'winged from Mercury!
I moved—approached the Snake-House!
Qh, the balm of Paradise that came and went!
The silver gleams of Eden shooting down the
trembling strings
Of my melodious heart,
Down-down to its coral roots!
I dashed aside the human tear; and—yes-
... prepared myself
With will, drunk from the eyes of Hope, to
gaze upon the Snake!
The Boal!

A Boa was there! A Boa’neath Crystal Roof.

SIGNS OF THE TIMES.
WHEN a man makes his wife a handsome present, it is a sign they
have been quarrelling recently. -
When a young lady “has a very bad cold, or else she'd be delighted,”
&c., it is rather a dangerous sign that, when once she sits down to
the piano, she will probably not leave it for the remainder of the
evening.
When a gentleman loses his temper in talking, it is a tolerably correct
º he is getting “the worst of the argument.”
hen a lady falls into hysterics, or faints, you may safely look upon
it, without being in the least accused of want of charity, as a sign of
extreme weakness on her part.
When you see the servant carrying under her apron a bottle of soda-
water into a house, you may at once seize it as a sure sign that some
one has been drinking over-night. - -
en, you see a Theatre breaking out with a violent eruption of
bills, and posters, and placards, proclaiming “a Blaze of Triumph,”, or
“an Unprecedented Success,” you may view it as a true sign that that
Theatre is not doing much.
When you see a shop bursting out in the same way, you may follow
it as a sign which will safely guide you to the same conclusion. -
When the children are always up in the nursery, you may construe it
into a sure sign that the mother does not care much about them... -
When an author invites a number of his literary friends and critics to
dinner, you may take it as an infallible sign that he is about to bring
out a new book.
When you see a pursy old gentleman rise on his legs, and request
“the ladies and rº, to fill their glasses,” you may consider it a
hopeless sign that he is about to propose a toast, and you may as well
make up your mind that from that moment there will be an end to the
amusement of the evening. - -
When you see the “lady of the house” casting her eye anxiously
round the dinner-table, in the hope of catching the other ladies' eyes,
you may put it down as a prophetic sign that you will shortly lose “the
society of the ladies,” who, rising in a body, and retiring into the
drawing-room, will “leave the gentlemen to enjoy their wine” (as if
gentlemen could only enjoy wine by themselves) |
When the host asks, “Will you have any more wine, gentlemen?”
you may take it as a pretty broad sign that you are expected to “go
up-stairs and join the º: ”—and that his next speech will be, if not
in those very words, very nearly to that effect. -
When a young couple are seen visiting a “Cheap Furniture Mart,”
you may interpret it into a pretty fair sign that “the happy day” is not
far distant. -
When you see a man go up in a balloon, or turn Director of a Rail-
way, or the Lessee of a Play-House, you have a right, if you like, to
look upon it as a sign of Madness. -
When the boys begin to tear up their books, it is a sign the holidays
are about to commence.
When the subject of an article is exhausted, it is a sign to leave off.
Curious Coincidence.
WoRDsworth tells us of his hero, PETER BELL, that—
A primrose by the river's brim
A yellow primrose was to him,
And it was nothing more.
A likeness to PETER may be found in his namesake, JACOB BELL, M.P.
As PETER looked with indifference on the beautiful objects of Nature,
so doth JAcob on similarly beautiful ones of Society. May we not say
of the hero of ST. ALBANs, that—
A sovereign with a yellow-rim
A yellow metal was to him,
And it was nothing more,
An IMPUpent CABMAN.—A Cabman rebuts the charge against his
fraternity of extorting more than eight-pence a-mile, by the argument
that eight-pence is their mean fare. -
WILL WATCH IN THE CITY.
s\\ , a TN SN HE name of “WILL WATCH
º *- ~ =}- the Bold smug.
\ - §H ºrº gler,” is familiar
to most of us.
Some of us have—
perhaps towards
the close of an
evening's recrea-
tion — heard the
song wherein that
hero has been cele-
brated. The pre-
sent abode of MR.
WILLIAM WATCH
is supposed to be
rather a solitary
one; a small re-
ceptacle some-
where on some
sea-beach, over
which the waves
dash, and the wind
* - - - - - - -- whistles, and near
whereunto the electric fluid has smitten a certain tree. This is incorrect.
WILL WATCH-exists at present in the City of London, under an alias
indeed, but alive and kicking, as hard as he can kick with his heels,
against public opinion, which disap es of him. Fancy pictures this
eminent, contrabandist as an able-bodied seaman in fierce mustaches,
long curls, a Flushing jacket, a white kilt, jack boots, and a leather waist.
band, whereby hangs a cutlass, and wherein are stuck a dirk and several
pairs of pistols. But the real MR. WATCH is remarkable for the ro-
tundity, rather than the muscularity or symmetry, of his proportion. His
costume is that of a respectable citizen; roomy but not otherwise loose.
About his person he sometimes wears a gold chain, much exceeding
in circumference, the belt of the ideal WATCH. He differs from the
imaginary smuggler, also, in generally sporting gaiters instead of jack-
boots; his lower extremities being subject to an affection requiring
attention to warmth. Such is the WILL WATch of the City, whose
last great achievement consisted in smuggling four words into an Act of
Parliament, and thereby enabling himself and his crew to levy black-
mail on all the coal brought within twenty miles of London. This is
the smuggler WILL WATCH, whose exploits might most appropriately
be sung at a Coal Hole.
. As the City WILL WATCH cannot much longer be suffered to commit
his depredations on our hearths and our homes, it is probable that he
will soon be “done up” in his nefarious business; and then, perhaps,
in our visits to the Bank, we shall see an Aldermanic figure, of diminished
corpulence, slinking about the purlieus of the Mansion-House, and
inviting the passenger of youthful or agricultural appearance into the
slums, to inspect a box of foreign cigars.
City Reform.
We are told in, the papers that the Council-room of the Mansion
House wants ventilating. This is not the only Room for improvement,
we are afraid, in the Mansion House; for, if you ask us, we think that
the whole system of management, that is pursued there, and in other
offices of the Corporation, stands in the greatest need of ventilation.
Consolation for Oxford.
Oxford has, hitherto, been considered as a nursery for statesmen;
but the fact that not one individual has been found to take the highest
honours there this year, has given rise to some apprehension that Alma
Mater has turned out no future Premier, or Lord Chancellor, in 1851.
But though no Oxford man has taken the first class, it is expected, on
the whole, that there will be an average number of Oxonians in the
Parliamentary train.

WELL l—ne’er I knew, till taught it thus,
—Till this last news flashed o'er the wave—
The worst harm that a Tyrant does,
Is what he does when in his gravel
It seems, the corpse of Greatness dead,
Like vulgar corpses here in town,
May such a ghastly vapour spread
As serves to knock a nation down!
It floats about—they call it Glory—
Its sickly haze enshrines a spark,
And—oh, fine moral of the story-
Shines clearest when the sky is dark!
The people watch the sparkle fair,
Within the vapour in the night,
And think the ignis fatuus there
A steady, useful, beacon-light.
And, Oh! fair spark, and purple haze,
The people cry, who watch the tomb,
Till, in the middle of their gaze,
It chokes their Freedom into gloom!

UPPose the head of the Executive,

head one morning to abolish the
Houses of Parliament:
Suppose some of the members
elected by large constituencies,
were to think it a duty to go
and take their seats, and were
to be met at the doors by swords
and bayonets, and were to be
wounded, and taken off to prison
for the attempt:
Suppose the Minister, having
been harassed by a few Parlia-
mentary debates and discussions,
were to send off to Newgate or
the House of Correction a few
of the most eminent members
of the opposition, such as the
DISRAELis, the Gºnºus, the
GLADstones, the BARINGs, and
a sprinkling of the HUMEs, the WAKLEYs, the WALMSLEYs, the
CoEDENs, and the BRIGHTs: -
Suppose the press having been found not to agree with the policy of
the Minister, he were to peremptorily stop the publication of the Times
Herald, Chronicle, Post, Advertiser, Daily News, Globe, &c, &c., and
limit the organs of intelligence to the Government Gazette, or one or two
other prints that would write or omit just what he, the Minister,
might please: -
Suppose, when it occurred to the public that these measures were not
exactly in conformity with the law, the Minister were to go or send
some soldiers down to Westminster Hall, shut . the Courts, send
the Lord Chancellor about his business, and tell LoRDs CAMPBELL,
CRANworth, and all the rest of the high judicial authorities, to make

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FROM JOHN THOMAS,
|N PARIS.
Wang Doo, Rew River Lee, Paris, 3 December, 1851.
O, MARY ANN' O, MARY ANN. '
Well may you bless your stars,
You’re living in a quiet land,
Away from Coodytars.
You’d never sneer at home, and wish
That you was here instead,
If you only knew what petty pangs
s a Frenchman's daily bread.
Oh! when I think what foolish folk
This City do contain,
I can’t quite fathom why it’s call’d
Department of the Sane.
They’ve been and filled the streets with troops,
With Marshal Lor to lead 'em;
And you may guess them soldiers take
Great liberties with freedom.
For 'twixt the Assembly and the Prince
There’s been a final fight,
And he has changed the Law of May
Into the Law of Might.
Long while, it seems, these silly men
Did nothing but º:
But finding talking did no good,
Resolved to have a Mute.”
* MR. John Thomas probably means émentes.
And c
So, at the house of MistER BAze,
These foolish plotters met;
(We’ve got green Baize at home you know,
But none so green as yet).
Their schemes the Prince don’t tell us yet,
For fear we should abhor 'em
But says, they meant to break the law,
And so he broke it for 'em.
And one John Darms he sent to seek
The plotters far and near;
And took 'em all away in vans,
With bagnets in their rear.
And TEARs, the cause of all this woe,
He managed to secure;
And sent him safe away to Ham,
His wicked tongue to cure.
And then to lessen our alarm,
He made a proclamation,
A-bidding all the army rise,
our hagitation.
“These fellows said you should be slaves,
I say you shan’t,” sez he ;
“And I’ve got fifty thousand men,
Who'll force you to be free.”
Now what will be the hend of this
There’s no one here can tell; -
For some folks think they’ll make the Prince
An Emperor as well.
“For isn't he as good,” they say,
“As him we had before?
If he was a NAPOLEON
This one's a Louis DoRE *”
Some think the Socialists will rise
And end his troubled days: .
And end him in a chaise and pair
Away to Pare la shays.
Some wish the ARLINEs party back,
Some hope they may miscarry,
And in their love for HENRY SINK,
Quite sink the Count DE PARRY.
But as for me, I’ve seen enough,
Nor longer wish to roam;
And while they make so free abroad,
I’ll be a slave at home.

“WHO IS LE NEWTON?”
ATE naval intelligence from Lisbon says:-
“The vessels left at Cintra, in the Tagus, were
–Prince Regent, 90; Leander, 50; Arethusa, 50; and
Dauntless, 33; and Le Newton French steam-sloop.”
Who is Le Newton & We
had among us once a NEWTON
—Isaac NEwton, if we do
not mistake—who discovered
things in the heavens, and so
forth. And the French have
the ill-taste and the
ill-manners to give
the name of a mere
astronomer-a sky-
sweeper—to a steam-
sloop. Let them. Our
Admiralty snap its
fingers * such fop-
pery; and very pro-
per, too. Why should
we christen ships
after sages and philo-
sophers, when we
have in our voca-
bulary such glorious, heart-inspiring names as Blazer, Borer, Growler,
Spitfire, and Cat-o'-Mountain?
POLICE EXTRAORDINARY.
GREAT excitement was occasioned at Guildhall, a few mornings ago,
by the appearance of a person, charged, before the sitting Alderman
with shooting dry rubbish into Mr. Punch's letter-box. -
The case was that of “an *... youth”—he would give no other
name—who pleaded guilty to the charge of having thrown the following
missile into the office, to the great annoyance of the inhabitants:—
“When is a hunter like a carpenter?—When he scours the plain.”
A Solicitor who attended for Mr. Punch observed that this was not
the only offence; for the same individual had asked,
“Why is the new seat of Government in India like the old one?—
Because it is similar (Simla).” -
The worthy Alderman regretted to see a person so young in a position
so degraded.
The prisoner, who had nothing to say, was fully committed.

THE CHARGE OF A TITULAR ARCHBISHOP AGAINST
HER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT.
THE, “LION of JuDAH,”, who pretends to be “ARCHBishop of
TUAM,” is reported by the Freeman's Journal as having, at a public
dinner, or rather, we should think, considerably after the dinner, made
a speech, wherein he represents certain Irish emigrants as having been
sent out in an unseaworthy vessel and drowned. According to our
Hibernian contemporary, the LION added:
“This is not a scene drawn from fancy. The vessel is said to have sailed from the

t
PROCLAMATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE LITERARY
REPUBLIC TO THE METROPOLITAN POLICE.
S self-constituted Dictator of
the British Empire, Mr.
Punch descended into
the streets, and issued
the following proclama-
tion to the Police :-
“Policemen! Be proud
of your mission; you
will save the country;
for I count upon you to
take up those subjects
that are too dangerous
for me to handle, and to
cause to be respected the
rights of pocket-hand-
kerchiefs, of which I am
the representative."
“For a long time you
have suffered, like me,
by the obstructions cre-
ated about four o'clock
every afternoon by the
vehicles in Fleet Street.
Those obstacles shall be
broken down. The Lord Mayor and Aldermen have disregarded the
authority which I hold from the whole nation. The Corporation has
ceased to exist.
. “I make a modest appeal to the people, and I say to them—Either
give me the means of controlling the cab and omnibus men, or choose
another in my place.
. “You have been treated as cupboard-lovers, and consumers of broken
victuals, Your heroic disinterestedness having been thus branded, you
were stigmatised as Crushers, and yet you are the élite of the Alphabet.
. “Remain immovable within the rules of your Inspector and Super-
intendent. And, by your imposing attitude, encourage the drunk and
disorderly to exert their powers of timely reflection. Be ready to
i resist any attack on the windows of 85, Fleet Street.
“Policemen, I do not speak to you of the associations which my
name recalls. They are engraven on many wood-blocks. We are
united by indissoluble ties—the principle of Progress is yours as well
as mine. In urging society to move on there has been a community
between us of glory and misfortune. There will be in future.com:
munity of sentiments and resolutions for the order and tranquillity of
Fleet Street.
“Given at the Corner of Bride Court, this 11th December.
“LOUIS NAPOLEON PUNCH.”
MRS. BAKER'S PET.
THE MORNING AFTER THE PET's FIRST NIGHT ATMR. BAKER's.
SCENE. 3.-The Dining-room at Blossom Terrace, with the table spread for
breakfast.
MR. and MRs. BAKER have risen, dressed, and come down to breakfast in
silence. MR. BAKER’s feelings on the subject of the Pet's over-night
performance are too big for words; MRs. BAKER feels deeply the
brutality of MR. B.’s conduct in consigning the Pet to the Yard, but
is rather afraid to approach the subject.
Mrs. Baker (sternly). Another cup of tea, MR. BAKER 2
Mr. Baker. No-(pushes his cup from him, coldly).
Mrs. Baker (making a dash into conversation, with forced cheerfulness).
He #" quite quiet towards morning, my dear. .
Mr. Baker (fiercely). I’ll tell you what it is, MRs. BAKER, some-
thing must be done with that dog. -
Mrs. Baker. I was sure he oughtn't to be put into the yard. If he
stays in-doors at night, he’ll protect the premises, and we shan’t have
the noise we had last night.
Mr. Baker. I really think— - -

Mrs. Baker (calling). ScAMP ScAMPY " I wonder where he can be?
Mr. Baker (with a momentary gleam of cheerfulness). Perhaps he’s
lost
Mrs. Baker (nervously). Oh, dear! I hope not—(rings the bell)—though,
I’m sure, after the treatment he had last night, poor thing—
[MR. BAKER mentally compares his sufferings, during the night, to those
of the cause of them.
Enter MARY (labouring with emotion).
Mrs. Baker. Where is the dog this morning 2
Mary (erploding). Oh, please, 'm, Cook was busy trimming the chops
for breakfast, 'm, and I was a-washing the front door seps,’m, and the
dog,'m, he went right into the kitching,’m, and took a cliop clean off
the plate,’m, and run out of the 'ouse, through the front door, wich the
baker was a-coming into the front garding, and we never seen nothink
more of 'im,’m.
Mr. Baker (triumphantly). There, my dear!
Mrs. Baker (sadly): Oh-then, he's lost. Dear, dear! and only the
second morning, too!
Mary. Yes,’m.
Mr. Baker (with renewed cheerfulness). Will you give me another cup of
dear—I don’t think he would have suited us.
Mrs. Baker (following the erratic ScAMP in imagination). Did you
see which way he went?
Mary. No,'m—he went right over me as I was a-washin' the step,
and I’m sure I was all of a trim’mle, and never looked to see where he
went to.

garden gate in the mornings? And what could Cook have been about
to let the dog get out of the kitchen, when you know he was strange,

Mr. Baker (alarmed). Painful subject, eh?
Mr. Puddicombe (oratorically). Differences between neighbours are
always painful. We are neighbours, MR. BAKER. (MR. BAKER bows.)
Ilive two doors down the Row.
Mr. Baker. Oh, indeed!
ii. Puddiconſe. Mrs. Puppicoxſºn is in delicate health, MR.BAKER
—extremely delicate health. She is the mother of nine children, Sir.
Mr. Baker. Ah, indeed! -
Mr. Puddicombe. And you may, therefore, naturally conceive, very
dear to me. (MR. BARER, by a rapid act of mental arithmetic, endeavours
to arrive at a notion how dear.) Restis essential to MRs. PUDDIcombe;
for myself, I can make sacrifices. But, for MRs. Puppicom BE, I never
make sacrifices, upon º: Sir, you may remark we’ve not had
any Punches in the Row, lately.
Mr. Baker. Why, I’m from home during the day, and so—
Mr. Puddicombe (caring his hand). Of course, not; but it’s a fact
that Punches have disappeared from the Row. I put them down, Sir.
Mr. Baker. Ah! -
Mr. Puddicombe. And you have probably observed that there is a
falling-off in organ-boys.
Mr. Baker. Why, really
Mr. Puddicombe. Being in the City, during the day, you have not
noticed it. There is a falling off in that nuisance, Sir. I did it. I
wrote three powerful letters to the Times, Sir; and I gave two of them
—I mean the organ-boys—in charge, for refusing to move on. -
Mr. Baker (cheerfully). The neighbourhoodought really to be obliged
to you, MR. Puppico MBE. - -
Mr. Puddicoºle. I trust so; but the public good is my object, and
the comfort of MRs. Puppi.com BB. I shall continue to discharge my
duty, Sir–ſplanting his umbrella firmly between his legs, and looking steadily
at Mā. BAKER)...I say, Sir, Ishall continue to discharge my duty.
Mr. Baker (mildly). i’ve no doubt of it. Sir. -
Mr. Puddicombe (awfully). And in the discharge of that duty, Sir, I
am come to tell you, Sir, that you are a nuisance.
Mr. Baker (startled at being thus described). A nuisance? Me?
Mr. Puddicombe (emphatically). A public nuisance, Sir! When I say
you, I mean that dog, Sir, which howled the whole night through in
your back-yard. - -
Mr. Baker. Oh! you heard it too, did you? Well, I assure you, I
never got a wink of sleep all night.
Mr. Puddicombe...I am come, Sir, to say, that dog must be put down.
MRs. Puppi.combe's comfort and a sense of public duty alike require it.

Mr. Baker. I quite agree with you, MR. Puppico MBE, and you’ll be
happy to hear—

Enter Miss Sounsop (a lady of a certain age, who hates dogs, having
long ago takeneatensively to cats).
Miss Soursop (rapidly). Good morning, Sir. M.R. BAKER, I believe?
Good morning, Mr. Puppi.combe. My name is Soussop, Mr. BAKER
-Miss Sounsop, four doors up the Row, and beg to say, that I’ve
seen the agent this morning to see the landlord, and say, that either
that dog or Iquit this neighbourhood.
Mr. Baker. That dog again, Ma'am!—that is, it’s MRs. BAKER’s dog.
Miss Soursop. Really, Sir, I’m astonished at MRs. BAKER,-and in
such a quiet ſeighbourhood, too! and the animal may have hydrophobia
—for I am sure there’s no saying what he may have, judging from the
horrid noise he made last night.
Mr. Baker. Oh, then, you heard it, Ma'am?
Miss Soursop (indignantly). Heard it, Sir? It’s shameful, Sir!

a reddish nose, grey hair, a close-buttoned blue frock, and a
generally eraggerated military appearance. He once belonged to
the militia; is fond of talking of “ours;” and is believed in the
neighbourhood to have served with distinction through all the
European cars ºf the century. He has a habit of expressing a
arish for gentlemanly satisfaction on slight provocation. He looks
on MR. Baker as a snob.
Major Parkyns Hawker (bowing stiffly). MR. BAKER, I presume? My
name is HawkER-PARKyns Hawker-Major PARKYNs Hawker.
[Mr. BAKER, duly overpowered, bows at each recurrence of the name,
with its stupendous additions.
Major Parkyns Hawker. By Fad. Sir, it’s scandalous!
Mr. Baker. Scandalous! hat's scandalous?
Major Parkyns Hawker. That dog, last night, Sir.
Mr. Baker (breaking out). Confound the dog!
Major Parkyns Hawker. As an old campaigner, Sir, I’m used to rough
it; but, by gad, I’d sooner sleep on a ten-gun field battery, than

THE MAN OF THE DIAMOND JACKET.
PRINCE ESTERHAZY, whilst in this country, made the most brilliant
reputation on record by means, of his jacket, covered as it was
with diamonds. A starlight night in a sh. frost was nothing so
resplendent as be-diamonded EstERHAzY. There was enough in, or on,
the man to set up ten armies of glaziers for ten Crystal Palaces; and,
therefore, PRINCE ESTERHAzY has an especial claim upon the credence
of Englishmen, when, after late consideration, he takes up the pen to
assure us that Kossuth is altogether unworthy of our sympathy, and
in fact, that “that person” is not a bit better than he ought to be;
being of low origin, and, of course, not born to a diamond jacket. Then
the Prince lauds the House of HAPSBURG; and of course we believe all
that the Prince says. Who would dispute the respectability of Peachem,
when vouched for by Mat-o'-the-Mint *

Prince for his admirable letter. BATThy ANY is a noble name; has

OH ! how common a buck is a reckless young heir!
Deficient in brains, but with money to spare
*Mong sharpers and black-legs, who spends his last crown;
Then goes to Boulogne, or is flung upon Town,
With his horse-jockey pleasures, and folly so green.
To his College or Regiment the simpleton goes,
Where he i. he races, he drives, and he rows;
Loses hundreds on hundreds by bet after bet,
And a great many very large sums at roulette,
With his horse-jockey pleasures, and folly so green.
A stud of fine horses—black, chestnut, and prey,
A four-in-hand pony-chaise, dog-cart, and sleigh,
He sports, quite regardless of cost and expense,
Till his cash is all gone, and his debts are immense,
With his horse-jockey pleasures, and folly so green.
Of a rascally set he's the king and the tool,
Who flatter, and cozen, and rob the poor fool;
And cocker'd whilst duped by the villanous crew,
He sneers at the steady, and honest, and true,
With his horse-jockey pleasures, and folly so green.
Ere at manhood arrived, he has spent his estate;
For money he raises with bills at post-date;
No matter, he borrows again, and away
Goes the loan, too, in carriages, races, and play,
With his horse-jockey pleasures, and folly so green.
Plate and furniture pawned, now the needful supply;
Destined, also, 'mid gamblers and swindlers to fly;
Till at last he's reduced to a pauper, and, worse,
Overloaded with debt, not a coin in his purse,
With his horse-jockey pleasures, and folly so green.
To his mother or sister the prodigal hies,
And vows reformation, and snivels and cries;
His debts he prevails on the women to pay,
And runs into others the very next day,
With his horse-jockey pleasures, and folly so green.
By this loving brother and dutiful son,
Again and again the poor creatures are done;
Their resources, at length, are exhausted, and fail;
Writs are out 'gainst our friend, and he's clapp'd into gaol,
With his horse-jockey pleasures, and folly so green.
The youth figures, lastly, in one of the Courts,
And shines in the Law or Insolvent Reports,
That tell us the same story, day after day,+
Of rascals' and simpletons' betting and play,
With his horse-jockey pleasures, and folly so green.
How strangely alike are these silly young men!
As closely as sheep of one breed in a pen;
There’s one stamp on them all—every dolt of the class—
Like the uniform stripe on the back of the ass,
With their horse-jockey pleasures, and folly so green.
It were something to be an original fool;
But these blades appear boobies º measure and rule:
Would they read but the papers, their pride it might shame,
To see themselves looking so basely the same,
With their horse-jockey pleasures, and folly so green.

Any youth, he's examined, to see if he's fit;
And they ought to make sure that he’s fully aware
Of this every-day case of the silly young heir, -

MUFFIN BELL v. CATHOLIC BELL.
ſ"|| || LEASE, Sir, I’m the little

last week, that was, for
doing nothing, but ring-
ing my muffin-bell in
Southwark, if you please,
Sir, to sell my muffins,

“And, Sir, if you
please, when the police-
man laid hold on me,
and the parish-officers
said as how I were to be
prosecuted and locked
up in gaol; if I didn't
for the time think I was
the wickedest boy as
ever was, and believed I
should in the end be
hanged, like JACK SEEP-
PARD, and all along of
the muffin-bell; break-
ing respectable people's
rests, and going and
= living upon a nuisance,
which was muffins with
a bell, as the gentlemen
of the parish very se-
verely said to me. ...
- “Howsomever, Sir
the Magistrate as I was taken afore, like a kind gentleman, said, he knowed f
shouldn't do it again; and so the parish folks let me go, and didn't I run home?
and wasn't my old grandmother pleased to see me safe and sound again, as she said,
qut of the lion's den? But the muffin-bell is never to tinkle no more; it's to be a
dumb-bell from this minute; and I’m not to ring to folks who wants muffins, but
to holla. And as that’s the law, Sir, made, as grandmother says, by the QUEEN,
with the crown on her head, and the Lords and the Bishops, it isn't for a little
boy like me to ring my bell (though, Sir, if you please, it’s a nice bell, and sºunds

“Well, Sir, if you please, they’re very good at the Black Horse, and always

about some monks at Clapham who’ve got a monkery (grandmother calls it), where
they’ve got a bell which they’re always ringing—abell a hundred times bigger than
any muffin bell that wakes Fº in the morning, and worries 'em all day, calling
the monks to prayers; as if they couldn't go about their praying, grandmother
says, like decent, quiet people, without stunning the whole world with their bell-
metal religion.
“And dmother (who got in such a pucker!) º to me, take up a pen, and

THE SWINDLING BILL SYSTEM.
...We have been appealed to by several correspondents, to protect them from the
bill and prospectus nuisance which prevails in the public, thoroughfares. It is
impossible to drive off in a cab from a railway station, without being pelted by
uffing pamphlets, whose pages fall “thick as leaves in Wall Ombrosa” on the
oor of the vehicle. It certainly is very hard that, those who have a horror of
putting their hands to a bill, cannot waſk the streets without being involved in
some dirty bill transaction, by being almost forced to accept a bill, presented by
one of the numerous walking nuisances that throng the Metropolis. We recºm-
mend, as the only mode of ºf the evil, that every bill intended for distribu-
tion in the streets, should be liable to a billstamp—though even this provision
might be evaded, for nearly all the bills in question have upon them the stamp of
humbug and knavery.
THE THEATRE or WAR (PARIs)—“Until further notice, all free admissions

WOL. xxi. D D
THE NEW CAB FARE.
(Suggested by the “Old Arm Chair.")
I'LL hail it! I’ll hail it!—who calls me a shab
For taking a ride in a sixpenny cab? . .
I’ve wish'd for it long; so I'll jump inside,
And take an economical ride.
They’ll hoot me, I know, before I depart;
But what care I when once I start?
Would you know the spell that takes me there?
An excellent thing is a sixpenny fare.
In a rainy hour I’ve linger'd near,
And whisper'd in many a cabman's ear,
And said what I could afford to give.
“I’ll not take it,” said he, “as long as I live.”
He told me with him I should never ride;
That I wasn't fit to sit inside.
And the imposition made me swear
I’d wait till he came to a sixpenny fare.
I’ve stood and watched, on many a day,
The cabs from the cab-stand call'd away;
And I’ve often been made extremely wild
When at me the cabman sneer'd and smiled.
He roll'd away: and I’ve often said,
There’s a victim going to be bled;
For I felt most thoroughly aware
There’d be half-a-crown for a shilling fare.
'Tis past! 'tis past! but the cabman now
Is glad to take me with smile and bow;
Where once he cursed me, and turn’d aside,
He civilly asks me now to ride.
He sees his folly; and now, each week,
He's making a fortune-so to speak-
For the public saves of its shoes the wear
By often taking a sixpenny fare.
I"OUR CORRESPONDENTS’ MEDAL.
As the world wags and wars, it is really unfair that whilst
medals are given to warriors in red coats, there is no dis-
tinguishing mark for the heroic soldiers of the press. We
are convinced that º a veteran with a Peninsular
medal at his breast, must have felt even the injustice of his
own decoration, when contrasted with the unrequited
bravery of “Our Own Correspondent” of the daily press,
coolly, magnanimously, taking notes in the bullet-shower
raining about a barricade-in the drench of grape saturat-
ing brick walls—and in the very cannon's mouth seeking
for “latest intelligence.” So coolly, so courageously, has
“Our Own Correspondent” done his work, that on the
next French revolution—say to-morrow, or the day after
—we should not at all be surprised at receiving, by electric
telegraph, something like the subjoined:-
[FROM our own corresponDENT.]
“Arriving on the Boulevard Italien, we have just received
a bullet.”
[FURTHER PARTICULARs.]
“We have received another bullet.”
[LATEST PARTICULARs.]
“We are dead.”
The Clock Epidemic at St. Pancras.
THE London clock disease is evidently chronic, and not
local, for it has gone in a circle nearly all roundiondon.
The malady has now reached St. Pancras, where it has
taken a peculiar form, for the bells strike, though the hands
never move—a phenomenon which Bell on the Hand gives
no explanation of. The St. Pancras clock must be in a
very wretched case, for it is continually striking itself,
without any motion of the hands–a state of things that
savours of derangement. We do not understand how a
clock can strike and not go, unless, as the electric clock
had something to do with lightning, the St. Pancras clock
may be j, thunder-struck.
How HE SUPPORTs It.—Louis NAPOLEON is called the
most important “member” of his family. Undoubtedly
he is the principal “leg” of it.

ALARMING INTELLIGENCE .
OUTBREAK IN THE CITY! !
MR. PUNCH IN A STATE OF SIEGE | | |
Punch Office, Wednesday, 5 A.M.
- N outbreak of a serious nature
has just occurred, which
threatens to affect the tran-
uillity, not merely of this
$º. but of the whole
Civilised World. We have
made most extensive ar-
rangements to secure the
fullest possible intelligence,
and shall continue to receive
hourly, half-hourly, and, if
need be, half-minutely re-
ports, which we shall hasten
to lay before an interested
Universe. Our first account
ls—
º (From our Prolir Reporter.)
lºſſ At an unpleasantly early
| \ hour this morning, Mr.
- Punch was disturbed from
his slumbers by the advent
of his faithful Toby, with
intelligence that startled him (Mr. P.) out of the wrong side of his bed, in
a fraction of time considerably less than the twinkling of any one of its
sts. From the hurried bow-wows of his ambulating informant, all that
r. Punch could gather was, that an émeute of an alarming nature had
broken out, which seemed to threaten the mental peace, not only of
himself in particular, but of the World at large. Having instituted a brief
but ineffectual search for his dressing gown (which was unfortunately
“at the wash”), Mr. Punch, with Iſis usual readiness of invention,
happily improvised a substitute by means of an old railway-wrapper;
and after performing a rapid act of toilette-ship, he dashed at once with
dauntless energy to inspect the scene of action,-choosing the remotest
of his garret-windows for the purpose. - -
With his usual sagacious penetration, Mr. Punch rapidly discerned
how matters stood. A single glance from his eagle eye served fully to
reveal the true state of the case: to assure him that the centre of this
great Charybdis of humanity was Himself! Conscious that its con-
tinuance would, of course, materially impede his circulation, Mr. P.'s
next object was to effect a speedy Dissolution of the Assembly. This
he hoped to achieve by a simple Appeal to the People from his first-
floor window; but upon opening it for that purpose, such was the roar
of the ophicleide-tongued crowd beneath, that he found it would re.
quire a speaking-trumpet of ten-million-Stentor power, at least, to
render his natural squeak at all audible.
In this desperate emergency, Mr. Punch was forced to hold rather a
protracted Council of State; and having remained
closely closeted with himself for some considerable
time, he at length resolved on the perpetration of
a violent and decisive coup d'état. Despatching his
canine aide-de-camp with instant orders to summon
the whole of his Household
troops (consisting of Cook,
Housemaid, Nurse, and Scul-
lery ditto, and the Knife-and-
errand Boy), Mr. Punch openly
declared himself in a State of
Siege; and, assuming his Marshal's bâton, proceeded
forthwith to lay his
- * entire establishment
under the full rigour of strict martial
law. . A Proclamation was accordingly
issued to that effect (signed Punch, coun-
tersigned Toby), and publicly affiché to
a conspicuous part of the front shop
shutters.
(From our Rapid Reporter.)
Ten o'clock. — The Proclamation has
been favourably received. A few faint cries of “A bas Punch.” were
heard, but promptly suppressed. A better feeling seems to prevail.

In the agricultural districts especially, the rising commenced this
morning at a very early hour.
At Birmingham, no less than fifty-three, News-agents have been
attacked, and their shops turned inside out by an eager and infuriated
mob. Blood was rted to have been shed, attended by a severe
slaughter, and much loss of life. On inquiry, however, the rumour was
found to have sprung from some purely business transactions at an
adjacent butcher's. -
P. S. The origin and object of the outbreak are alike still locked in
mystery.
P.P.S. We hasten to state that we have just found the key. From
reliable information, received five seconds since, we
may safely venture to assert our firm conviction, that
the disturbances have one and all originated in the
circulation of a malicious and unfounded report, that
this was the day fixed for the recurrence of that great
National Event— the publication of our Almanack /
This timely discovery will, of course, materially lessen
the alarm and astonishment which the readers may
possibly have felt at the otherwise extraordinary
occurrences we have been describing. As it is, they
are certainly not so much to be wondered at: indeed, we, almost
question if they may not be received as a perfectly natural and inevi.
table result.
THE KING STREET ARCADIA.
HE principal Lions of London,
at this season, are Lions with
horns and hoofs—the fat cattle.
All the great people have been
going to see the great brutes.
At the KingStreetBazaar, they
have feasted their eyes on the
living beef, mutton, and pork,
destined shortly to afford them
a more substantial banquet;
on the sheep, oxen, and pigs,
within a month to be bodily
transmuted principally into the
superior classes of society, and
partly, let us hope, into dis:
tressed needle-women, and
~
:
...-rºw
under circum-
stances.
Even Beauty has, in a mea-
sure, brightened with its smile
the huge mountains of flesh,
some fragments of which will
very shortly be identified
with its own substance. Now, the countenance of Beauty, is very
desirable for any Exhibition, both in itself, and considered as an
auxiliary attraction. Therefore, the more º attendance of ladies
at the Šmithfield Club Cattle Show is to be wished for. But if that
advantage is to be realised, this spectacle must cease to be a dull
prosaic exhibition of hogs, and beasts of the field.
Šm JAMrs GaAHAM has said that we are to become a pastoral and a
º instead of a corn-growing people, and his prediction, to judge
y
the yearly increasing magnitude of the Smithfield Club Show, seems
in course of fulfilment. By carrying out, in the arrangements of that
show, Sir James GRAHAM’s prophecy more fully, its managers might
invest it with the elegant and refined character required to obtain for
it fashionable and female patronage. Their plan, for that purpose,
would be, to convert it, one evening, at least, into an exposition costumée,
at which the chief exhibitors and others who assist, should appear in
pastoral attire, with appropriate scenic and other accessories. ..
The idea of such a display may, to some minds, appear slightly
extravagant; but it should be remembered that this festive season of the
year is a warrant for a little extraordinary gaiety. “It is not often we
are thus jocose;” only at a fancy dress ball now and then: but what is
reasonable at Buckingham Palace cannot be preposterous at King
Street. And then, not only would hilarity be promoted, but trade would
be encouraged by the execution of the scheme here advocated. Imagi-
nation easily realises the scene that would be presented.
The King Street Bazaar is enlarged, and by aid of SIR. JoséFH
Paxton and Mr. Stanfield is converted into an Arcadia in Urbe. The
spectator wanders amid a pleasing variety of mossy banks, umbrageous
trees, grottoes, waterfalls, and fountains, some of which play Bau-de-
Cologne; particularly in the vicinity of the porcine department.
#. illustrious and noble personages, and other, gentlemen who are
the chief prize-holders and contributors to the Exhibition, or are other-
wise interested in agriculture, together with the ladies belonging, to
their families, attend, habited as shepherds and shepherdesses, either
diaphoretic
journeymen tailors working
in the old classical attire, or in the style of WATTEAU, or in a com:
promise between the garb of the original rural swain of antiquity and
the modern agricultural gentleman. The diversions of the evening
consist of a conversazione, varied by music and the rites of TERPsichore,
which, as the assembly may be said to represent the country party, are
principally celebrated in country dances.
His Roy AL HIGHNEssPRINCE ALBERT perhaps condescends to appear
as MELIBGEus, guardian of oxen; he has well earned that distinction.
He engages in an eclogue with LoRD John Russell, who, as TITYRus, is
meditating the affairs of the nation under the shade of a wide-spreadin
beech-tree. The DUKE of RICHMOND, Colonel SIBThorp, M.P., an
MR. MECHI, compare notes as MENALCAs, DAMCETAs, and PALEMON.
PHYLLIS, AMARYLLIS, Chloe, DAPHNE, and their sister nymphs, are
impersonated by the Lady Patronesses of Almack's, and other ladies of
}. M. JULLIEN and his band are in attendance, and execute
Eethoven’s “Pastoral *::::::" in addition to their usual per-
formances at the Nobility's balls. Now and then a gentle shepherd
obliges the º with a solo on the flageolet, the pigs join in a
grumphony, and Mr. Punch contributes to the general tº: with
his Pandean P.
A reverend gentleman and classical scholar, as well as an eminent
breeder, reads a Bucolic.
Punch translates the same for the benefit of the country gentlemen.
tº: musical portion of the company join in HANDEL's charming
Chorus,
“Oh, the pleasures of the plains!"
from Acis and Galatea; and, after that, sing the National Anthem: and
then the plump-calved variegated domestics announce the carriages.
WHAT NEXT!
ooKING at the present state of affairs in Europe,
it seems that we are to put up with the
f. of anybody whose relation
appens to have seized upon a crown at
a previous period.
he government of the Continent de-
volves uponcertain individuals as a family
property. . With the Governor's hat,
they inherit the Governor’s diadem.
There is the Count DE CHAMBORD,
who claims through his grandfather;
the ORLEANs Princes through their papa;
Louis NApoleon through his uncle.
The Legitimists claim on the ground
of their “family respectability,” which,
by-the-by, was recently appealed to in
another Court—we mean the County
Court at Liverpool—by MR. RAMSHAY.
Louis NAPOLEoN claims, because his
uncle was a man of abilities. But, as the
grandson of a Corsican attorney, he ought
to have known better, and to have been
aware that he can't succeed to the possession of what was only a “life-
rent.”
Now, what next?—If things are all to be managed like this, we have
only one thing more to expect. Our friend Higglestone BRUCE, of
the Scotch Greys, is a descendant of King Robert BRUce; and why
don’t he claim the crown of Scotland? O'NEILL, of the Outer Temple,
represents the ancient royal family of Ireland; and why don't he issue a
|proclamation to his subjects in Erin Yet, though both these illustrious
|names have, more than once, figured on a half-crown stamp, neither of
them has yet been appended to a royal edict Qr, look at the case of
| PHILABEY STEwART, of Berkeley Chambers, whose blood is a pure
royal tap. Twice has the Hanoverian dynasty sent him to their
dungeon—the Bench—and yet, the poor fellow has never summoned
the subjects of his ancestors to the rescue !
Surely, they manage these things better in Franceſ

SIR FRANCIs HEAD has written a letter to the Times in justification
of Louis NAPOLEoN. SIR FRANCIs appears to be quite moved and
affected at the idea of the danger the ex-President was placed in. The
Head is clearly touched.

ou R PARIs LETTER.
(From our own Corrºpondent.)
S -
IR, INSTANTLY on receiving your unmistakeable hint that there
was “going to be another shindy in Paris, and the sooner I was of the
better,” I was off. It pained me to think that a promised payment of
rent, and a couple of bills which had fallen due, must be neglected;
but such is ever the result of º interests, when nations plunge
into broils and discord. How finely has some great poet remarked
upon such matters, in words which, as your office library is at hand, I
can't say that I remember. - -
I found all in confusion here—cannon roaring, musketry crackling,
the French journalists under beds, and the correspondents of the
English papershopping about from barricade to barricade, taking notes
in the thickest of the fire. The Times writer had three cabs killed under
him, besides the inconvenience he sustained by the omnibus, in which
he next ensconced himself, being upset to make the centre of a barri-
cade. The architects refusing to let him out, he was somewhat annoyed
by the fire of the artillery upon him, but managed to obtain, much
information. The Daily News gentleman was also a good deal jeopar-
dised, by his going into the hottest part of the fire, and insisting that the
conflict should not go on until he had taken down the names on each
side, with notes of any family anecdotes of the combatants which might
be interesting to the general reader. The correspondent of the Chronicle
gave so much offence, by forcing his way into the Elysée, and taking
the º of military operations out of the hands of the Generals, that he
might make a copy of it, on tracing paper, for, England, that he was
furiously ordered out of France, and it was only by his threatening that
he would have war declared by return of post, that he was allowed to
make his copy quietly; and all the sentinels still fire at him whenever
he goes out for a walk. Indeed, not one of the English writers possesses
a single article of dress which is not riddled with balls, but they have
not as yet had time to account for the fact of their not having them.
selves been shot through and through.
As for me, I went off at once to Louis NApoleon, whom I used to
know in Leicester Square days, and, being anxious to send you a com-
plete account of the military proceedings, I requested to be placed in
communication with the Generals. Louis NAPQLeoN recognised me
instantly, and said, coldly, “An emissary of Punch, I think?” I
would not at that moment cavil upon a word, and accepted the phrase.
“Mais, certainement, your wishes shall be complied with,” he continued,
writing a few words on a piece of paper. - -
"In confidental communication,” I said, “if your Highness pleases.”
“Have no fear,” he replied, his nostrils quivering in their usual
remarkable way when he is excited; “Monsieur's confidence is not a
thing to be neglected. Suiver cet homme.”
I obeyed, and in the second ante-room I found eight officers of police.
One of them invited me to accompany him down the Escalier, and, to
my astonishment, the others closed around us... I hate ceremony, but
said nothing. A carriage was at the door. I was handed in, and all
the policemen got into or upon the vehicle, three inside, two on the
box, and the others hanging behind. Those inside pulled up the
shutters, and we were in darkness; but I distinctly heard the cocking
of three pistols. Thenceforth I was silent—the journey was long-
very long—but it ended. The carriage stopped. I was handed out.
It was midnight, and I saw the stars glittering coldly above us. In
another moment I was hurried through a grim iron doorway, and
along º and through vaults. At length another door was
opened, and I found myself in an apartment, where poor military men
were playing at bouillote. They laid down their cards, and rose to
receive me.
“Monsieur wished to be placed in confidential communication with
The Generals. M. LE PREsident refuses no reasonable wish of his
friend, M. Punch. The Generals are before Monsieur.”
Sir, before me stood the stern CHANGARNIER, the stern CAvAIGNAc,
the stern BEDEAU, and the stern LAMoRICIERE. And behind me, as he
spoke, banged the sterner Gate of the Fortress of Ham!
Sir, I am in the PRESIDENT's hands, and yours, and am also,
Hotel Ham. YoUR own CoRREspondent.
FUNNY MARKET AND WITTY INTELLIGENCE.
The pure ore of wit being five shillings per mille in the City, and one
shilling at the West End, it follows that the precious metal alluded to
is four times dearer at Guildhall than it is in Belgravia.
700 bags of coarse jokes were delivered during the week at...our
establishment by the Post-Office. No price was named, and the articles
remainin bond; but there was afterwards a consignment of a better
sort, which readily found a market.
A gloomy feeling was created by the following:-
... “Why is a hotel-keeper making a fire at the gable end of his house
like a man drinking gin?—Because he’s warming his in-n-side 1"
A still further despondency ensued, when one of the oldest jokers in
the trade offered to supply any quantity equal to the following, at an
eighth lower than last week.
“Why is an errand-boy like an old horse put up to auction?-Be-
cause he’ll go for what he’ll fetch.”
After this the jobbers gave up the whole affair as a bad job; 500
defaulters were declared. Settling day was adjourned sine die; the
bears disappeared; and the Bulls—from sº Market—speculating
for a rise, threw up everything to a most unhealthy pitch—when our
own reporter, flying as fast as he could, climbed to the top of a
neighbouring pump “for safety and for succour.”

THE FRENCH DICTATOR TO HIS ARMY,
IN PLAIN TERMS.
UR contemporaries the news-
papers sometimes, though
seldom, translate French
very badly. Strange to say,
not one of them correctly
rendered that very per-
spicuous document, the
rench Dictator's Address
to his Army; which, done
into honest English, runs
simply thus:-
SoLDIERs!
The hour of tri-
umph has at last arrived.
For the accomplishment of
my design, so long che-
rished, of overthrowing the
Republic, and seizing on
the reins of despotic
power, I feel that I can
count upon you.
You will not have for-
§. the plain of Satory.
our palates yet tingle with
the flavour of my sausages;
- your ideas still dance, en-
livened by my champagne...You will not cease to taste the sausages; the
spirit of the champagne will not º from your heads, till you have
rendered me the service for which I stuffed you with the one, and
drenched you with the other.
Soldiers! I turn you loose upon the people. Bayonet—shoot down
—all who resist you. Fire at the windows of private houses; hesitate
not to cannonade the dwellings of your fellow-citizens. Strike terror
into the hearts of your countrymen; show yourselves more formidable
to them than you ever were to the enemy. It is you who, for me, must
awe into submission the people of France.
Domy work, soldiers, and you shall not miss your reward. You
shall have more sausages, more champagne. Every fellow-citizen you
shoot, a sausage; every brother-repub ican you run through the body,
a bottle of champagne; small Germans and pints for the blouses; for
the rest, saveloys and quarts. Cram me down the throat of the nation,
and I will return the obligation with .." and champagne.
Forward—to never-ending glory—to pºpetu lunch. Remember
glory: remember champagne and sausages!!
No. II. EMPEROR.
WANTED A. FOG.
IT is lucky a good thick English November Fog did not fall upon
Paris at the commencement of the present outbreak. The troops
might have found it very different work than firing at the balconies, and
windows, and portes cochères, and the idlers in the streets; and even
storming a barricade #: have been attended with a different result,
when a soldier couldn’t have seen the distance of his musket before
him. Who knows, whether the progress of the revolution, and the
career of fours Nºroºon (and we do not think we should have ;
into mourning if such an event had taken place), might have been
suddenly cut short, as was too often the case with the French Telegraph,
by the old familiar amusement of “Interrompu par le Brouillard.”
The Great Peace-maker.
THE quartern loaf-a, hard truth for the Protectionists l—is the
; peace-maker when, labelled 5d., and, it is said, in some parts of
ndon, 4}d. Wery significant, that monetary notice . The Advertizer
says–
“The average price of bread during the present winter will not exceed 5d. for good
family bread, and best 6d. to 64d., or at most 7d. per loaf. There is an excellent
stock of flour and wheat in the metropolis, both British and foreign.”
Whilst the quartern loaf cries “54,” it cries peace and content
throughout the kingdom. That “5d.” is, in truth, the voice of the
turtle heard in the land. With what a “merry Christmas” does the
cheap loaf greet the poor!
FRENch News.-IT is certainly a curious fact, and highly charac-
teristic of the country, that the first important fact which the Sub-
º: ºwn had to transmit from France should have been a
evolution :
THE CONVENT BELLS OF CLAPHAM;
OR, SOLTAU v. DE HELD.
OH, MR. Soltau.' what are you about,
ãº. the Saints an action to be bringing?
Mind DUNSTAN doesn't catch you by the snout,
Because you strove to stop DE HELD from ringing.
How he served one Old Gentleman you know;
Take care he doesn’t also serve you so!
Know you what sort of fellows you provoke P
I scarcely can imagine that you do, man.
Why, Sir, they cross the sea upon a cloak,
And shine, like º in the dark (ask NEWMAN,
In case you won't believe my friendly rhyme)—
They’re seen in several places at a time.
They’ve power, dear Sir, to knock you into fits,
To put you in a state of catalepsy;
To drive you wild, or take away your wits;
Plague you with colic, phthisic, gout, dyspepsy;
Cause3. in short, more ailments to endure
Than BºAge could compute, or physic cure.
Wi. don’t §." know that when his head was off,
The good ST. DENIS was observed to toddle,
Holding beneath his arm—although you scoff-
Holding, I say, beneath his arm, his noddle?
Nor how it rained like mad to please St. SwitHus?
Peace, as the Saints' own townsfolk say, be with 'un!}.
You would repent, if SwitHUN turned his spout
º your pleasure-grounds, and swamped your flowers;
Or DENIs were to make you walk about
Without your pate, soused by the other’s showers,
That you had ventured to indict the usance
Of ringing in Saints' honour as a nuisance?
What, if the bells keep jingling all the day?
What, if you can't sleep, read, converse, or write?
If you don’t like the noise, you needn't stay
At Park Lane, Clapham; but don't tempt the spite
Of Saints who—as St. Alban's case will settle—
So dearly love the music of bell-metal.
'Tis very true the law's relentless spell
Has hush'd the muffin-vendor's little tinkle;
Also, that the Redemptorists' big bell
To that, is as a lobster to a winkle:
But monks, exempt from every statute’s compass,
Expect permission to create a rumpus.
Unless you’d have the Saints about your ears,
Those ears you still must suffer to be split;
Although a grievous hardship it appears,
To such a dire infliction to submit.
So—if your worthy neighbours in their cells
Wear caps—why leave them to their caps and bells!
TIGER SENSIBILITY.
Louis NAPOLEoN visited the wounded soldiers at the hospital of the
Gros Caillou. The wounded were in ecstacies to behold him! It is said,
º to shooting down peaceable citizens in the streets of Paris,
and firing into drawing-rooms amidst women and children, every soldier
received a five franc piece; the human machine fired with a silver
bullet ! And the President at the Hospital decorated the maimed. “All
the men,” says the Advertizer correspondent, “on receiving their
crosses, kissed them till their eyes moistened.” And, we further learn,
“tears filled the eyes of the President.” Creature of sensibility! If he
can weep over the wounded, how shall he sorrow and howl over the
dead?—Over the murdered of the families who had received their
“crosses,” after a different fashion, in the loss of father and husband,
son and brother? How many has the President “decorated” with the
“cross” of an agonized heart?
One of the Wrongheads.
SIR FRANCIs Bond HEAD has to keep up a reputation for the
marvellous and eccentric. Therefore, the French President, reeking
with civil glory, is an object of especial interest to the author of a Bundle
of French Sticks—and—(it may be added in a second edition)–Bayonets.
But Louis-NAPOLEoN has no need of a HEAD ; what the Tiger-
Monkey wanted is—HEART.

PUNCH*S MUSEUM OF EXTINCT RACES.
|
º º ſº

|Tºº!
tºº.
MR. CATLIN, so celebrated for having made a book on all the Indian
races, has proposed to collect a Museum, consisting of individuals of all
the tribes that are now rapidly passing º and he contemplates
visiting all the principal cities of Europe and America with this Red-
Men-agerie. The idea is so good, that we rather think of adopting it,
by forming a collection of all the numerous races that are on the eve of
becoming extinct among our own countrymen.
Number one in the catalogue of our Museum will be the Protectionist,
who may, perhaps, be seen, “Alive, Alive!” for a short time longer.
The animal is getting every day more scarce; and it is only by walking
up into our show at once, that the public will be “now in time” to
witness this greatest wonder of the world, this freak of human nature,
which is fast disappearing from the British soil; The creature has
become so scarce, that it is no longer to be considered as the friend of
man, but is wild, snappish, and spiteful. Nevertheless, it may be
approached without danger, and may often be led by the nose with
wonderful facility by those who understand its treatment.
Number two in our Museum will be an animalso rare that there is
scarcely a specimen left, and that is the Stage Coachman. This harmless
creature used formerly to scour the country from one end to the other,
until it was driven out of its usual resorts by the iron hand of invention.
The coachman was an important character when all the world was a
stage, but has sunk into insignificance since, all the world has been
a railway. The animal used to be in some degree a beast of prey,
preying on the pockets of travellers to a large extent; but it
gradually disappeared from the face of the country, and it would be
impossible to say what has become of the lost genus. A votary of the
Pythagorean doctrine would, perhaps, look for the lost stage coachman
in the tails of the Smithfield Cattle Show.
ºn milli
º
º
Number three in the catalogue of our Museum, will be the old
Watchman; a sort of human sloth, whose constant repose was so little
interrupted, that he could, in a state of somnambulism, cry the hour.
Though inoffensive himself, he was the cause of offence in others; for
his presence, ins of quelling a disturbance, always furnished a
temptation for raising one. The only specimen of the tribe that still
exists is to be seen in the private watchman, whose physical imbecility
is usually enhanced by the feebleness of helpless inebriety. The night
watchman was supposed to be unfriendly to the tribes of nocturnal
depredators; but he was in fact the . friend, for he always gave
warning of his approach, by a melancholy cry, and by the illumination
of a lanthorn he carried about with him, causing him to be seen at a
distance, and preventing him from seeing others.
Number four in our Catalogue is the greatest curiosity of the whol
from the fact of the sudden disappearance of the tribe, which, unti
recently, was very numerous. The animal alluded to is an Irish Re-
pealer—a member of a class that was more than plentiful two years
ago; but, as some tribes recede towards the setting sun, this tribe has
been rapidly disappearing, before the rising sun of intelligence. The
creature was º mischievous when the race was in full vigour;
and we certainly should not think it worth while to preserve a specimen
of such an inferior article, were it not for the curiosity which may
hereafter attach to it. -
Qur Museum will include numerous other objects of rarity, and we
has shall add to it from time to time; one of the magnificent additions we
contemplate—as, shortly coming within the scope of our collection-
being that º disappearing animal, which is not only dying out,
but getting violently exterminated nearly every day — a French
Republican.
LOUIS NAPOLEON, EMPEROR.
MARVELLous is it to find of what things certain of the English
Press will, at times, make pets and darlings! Wonderful is luck! A
SAwNEY BEAN may have his apologists, as a human benefactor
desirous to keep down over-population; as a LOUIs. NAPOLEQN has
been eulogised for making dead bodies the steps to his loftier eminence.
If it be true that the President aims to become Emperor, he has
certainly prepared himself for the dignity. Already his robes drop
purple !
A DOUBTFUL LEGATEE.
We observe advertised a book, reprinted from the edition of 1625,
entitled “THE MOTHER's LEGACIE to her UNBORNE CHILDE, by
ELIZABETH Joceline.” From this work of MISTREss Joceline's it
would seem that in the good old times there was some ground for
the good old caution—“Don’t reckon your chickens before they are
hatched.”
HOW MUCH FOR THE IRISH ATLASP
THE gentleman who bears the World upon his shoulders—as editor of
the Irish journal so called—is reported by the papers to have given a
piece of evidence, to which, probably, the ... in a general sense,
affords no parallel. The following extract is taken from the case of
“BIRCH v. Som ERVILLE:—
*: Hºwarm-upon your oath, how much a year ought you to get for your
services 2"
“Witness (after some deliberation).-I think £5000 a year would not be too much
(laughter).”
If one were loRD LIEUTENANT of IRELAND, and could but buy the
Irish ATLAs at the market price, and sell him at his own, how much
would one gain?
The precise sum cannot, perhaps, be calculated with, complete
fractional accuracy; but there is little doubt that something over
£4099.19s. 11%d, would be netted by the transaction.
THE WORST OF ALL StoRMs.-Storming a barricade.

In front of the Bar, where I shone like a star.

And the fierce Policeman, A. No. 3,
Would feel his great authority
Sink in his boots, for the love of me!
But at night I would chatter away, away!
I would fling on each side my curling hair,
And lightly trip, like a Bloomer fay,
From the screws, and pipes, º pints of beer;
And I’d throw such a glance, so sly and deep,
That the soft young gents, with satin tie,

For I’d not be kiss'd by all who list,

In the front of the tubs marked X's three;
But the licensed “wither ” should marry me-
Woo me, and win me, and marry me.
Then no more would I wear the trousers rare,
Pºp! such as 'twould be too hard to see,

And my husband would yield, for the love of me.

Testimonials to Louis Napoleon.
...LOUIs NAPOLEoN's apologists say, that he knows his cue. Very
likely. He is believed to have handled it, often enough: unch
suggests the presentation to the Dictator of France, as a testimonial to
him on having triumphed over the liberties of his country, of a handsome
billiard-table, with balls of lead. A rouge-et-noir board might be added;
the rouge suggesting the fluid which has been shed in the late coup
d'état, and the noir expressing the character of that transaction.
“In the Name of Folly.”
THE name of the French Minister of Finance (for the present) is
Foul D. We are afraid, that before many weeks are over, not only
the Minister of Finance, but the entire Ministry will find that it
has been completely Fould—“fooled to the top of Louis NAPOLEON's
bent.” In fact, the FoolED MINISTRY wouldn't be a bad name for it.
• Country readers may be unaware, that those intelligent men, the Publicans of Lon-
don, have entirely put an end to the Bloomer fever, by making their Barmaids adopt
i the dress.

enough makes his appearance, among other places, in the Moniteur.

ORIGIN OF THE PHRASE “HOOKEY WALKER.”
OUR ingenious contemporary, Notes and Queries, (the Editor of which
must have a most inquiring mind; for he seems to inquire into the
truth, meaning, use, and origin, of almost everything), has favoured us
with the origin of the term “Hookey Walker,” which is certainly
very ingenious, but we doubt if it is exactly correct.
The true origin of the term is as follows:– “It is well known that
R. WALKER is the name of the gentleman, by whose influence and
exertions, continued for many years, at the peril of his own health,
the horrors of intramural burial were first brought before Parliament.
When the Metropolitan Interments Bill was passed, the claims of
MR. WALKER were naturally laid before the Government: but Govern-
ment pretended to have no knowledge of him whatever, and indignantly
exclaimed, “MR, WALKER!-Hookey WALKER,” Hence the term has
grown into popular use, and is generally adopted as an easy one, when
a person wishes to shift off an obligation, or to pretend ignorance of an
one who may have just claims upon him. It is a term frequently used,
and the more's the pity, by Government officials towards scientific men,
or from heroes deserving well of their country.
Abolition of Capital Punishment.
THE Government has come to a determination to abolish capital
punishment. SMITH, the monster, who murdered an infant under the
most revolting circumstances, is to be transported for life—not hanged.
Of course, after such commutation of sentence towards such an offender,
we shall hear no more of the gibbet. Who can be worthy of the halter
if SMITH's neck has escaped the noose? As we have ever advocated
the abolition of the gallows, we are, of course, happy to learn that JACK
KETCH will be duly indemnified for the loss of fees.
As It shoulp BE,-We understand that Mons. JULLIEN's Mons-ter
Concerts were brought to a close with the singularly appropriate air of
“Farewell to the Mountain.”

NAPOLEON'S BOOK OF FATE.
SPUNCH is not exactly a
prophet—he works by wit
(as everybody knows), and
not by witchcraft—he can-
not say what positively will
happen, with all the confi-
dence of a clairvoyant. He
can only predict what is
likely to happen, and what
will probably, be the con-
sequence if that which is
likely to happen, happens.
By the time these words
appear in print, Louis NA-
poleon either will have
been accepted as Dictator
by the French º or
- he won’t. Whether he
will or not, Punch does not undertake to prophesy, because, though the
measures which he has adopted to manage and control the election
render it very probable that he will, yet justice sometimes overtakes a
criminal sooner than }. expect. If 85, Fleet Street, were an
Insurance Office, Punch would not like to effect a policy for one week,
ºn the life of a man with some 800 murders on his head. However, if
MR. Bonaparts gains his election, it is pretty certain what will then
take place.
MR. Bonapalate will get up a grand public ceremonial. He will be
assisted by the entire strength of that sanguinary corps dramatique, the
army of Paris. He will cause a posse of ecclesiastics also to attend in
their illuminated canonicals. In short, he will exhibit a regular
theatrical spectacle, with the normal and customary array of “Guards,
Officers, Soldiers, Priests, and Attendants,” such as we see at Astley's,
wherein Goºſersal sustains the character of the hero; namely, that of
MR. Louis NApoleon Bonaparte's uncle.
There will be a solemn procession, very likely, to some church, as
MR. Bonaparte has taken to patronise religion so much of late, since
he has become truculent: a piece of policy which he may have learned
while sojourning in England, at the theatre, of Richard the Third.
MR. BonapaRTÉ will, perhaps, go down on his knees, and pray for the
souls of the victims of December 3 and 4; the victims not of ambition,
but of an unfortunate necessity. A scene of weeping will probably be
acted likewise by this eminent tragedian; he will embrace some person,
or something pertaining to somebody who has been assassinated by his
troops; and shed certain tears over the object or individual, as the case
may be. These crocodile's drops having been supposed to have washed
away all the bloodshed of the late coup d'état, there will be a general
outburst of blubbering, succeeded by a universal fit of enthusiasm,
venting itself in cries of Wive Napoleonſ, Wive l'Empereur/. A bishop
will bless the whole ceremony, and the solemnities will conclude with a
dance and a display of fireworks. -
And then the revolution will begin over again; and there will be more
misrule, more insurrections, more fighting, more *:::: more public
theatricals, crying, embracing, blessing, fireworks, and dances.
Every year there will be a mass, in commemoration of the victims of
1851, as for those of 1848 and 1830; and future years will give
occasion for similar services, until, at length, every day in the whole
twelvemonths will be the anniversary of the slain in some émeute or
revolution.
All these things are written on the open page of the Book of Fate:
and will inevitably come true, unless France turns over a new leaf.
Wonders will never cease.
The following remarkable passage occurs in a letter in the Morning
Post, on French affairs, *...* J. RYDER BURTon:—
“Ever since the deplorable catastrophe of the decapitation of Louis XVI., the body
politic of France has marching about without a head.”
* This reads like a º that the body politic of France
was identical with Louis XVI, and that the decapitated monarch is
still enacting the miracle of St. DENIs. Where was Burton's head
when he penned the passage? to which we beg to call the attention of
DR.NEwMAN and the fathers of the Oratory, as something rather more
in their way than in ours.
FRENCEI NUTS TO CRACK.

Boulevards, by Louis Napoleon, which riddled all the windows, has
furnished a collection of riddles, that all the ingenuity of the Parisians

was his º;
made the guardian
of public morals;
or, rather of that
section of public
morality that visits
the playhouses. It is
not generally known
- - that the LoRD
CHAMBERLAIN licenses all the muslim petticoats, of the opera dancers;
and his Lordship, being on his native hills a kilted Scotchman, has, of
course, an instinctive sense of what makes the longitudinal propriety of
a petticoat. He measures the muslin with his wand of office as rigidly
as a linen-draper measures web by statute yard. This is very proper;
hence Her Majesty's Theatre—the ballet being on—is the somewhile
abode of all the proprieties. Prudery herself may be seen in stall or
private-box, with an instructed Quakeress dotting the pit,
The LoRD CHAMBERLAIN has, moreover, doubled his moral value as
a conservator of public decency. His watchful spirit is ever mani;
fested in the delicacy of the text of every new and every translated
drama. Hence, º: of the Prodigal Son is presented to us as-
according to play-bill English—“a shrieking” burlesque, and Mr.
SIISBEE-an excellent actor, if he were not too much encumbered by
refinement; a little weighted by an over-sense of delicacy of gesture and
expression—and Yankee SILSBEE permitted to invocate “Moses in the
i. as a familiar acquaintance. Yes; the moral yalue of a Licenser
º is evident to the lowest capacity that pays its sixpence at the
gallery.
However, heretofore pantomimes were not licensed by the CHAM-
BERLAIN ; that is, no more than the fairy opening of the revel: for when
Harlequin and Clown started, they were tacitly sanctioned as char-
tered satirists. Tricks and transformations went free, and our easy,
jocund CHAMBERLAIN took no heed of them, But it is very different now.
BREADALBANE, like any weasel, on the Grampian Hills—supposing
that any one weasel can get a living there—BREADALBANE is awake.
Yes; the CHAMBERLAIN goes through the pantomime; insists upon
having every trick and change laid before his official eye, that he may
duly consider whether there may not be some disaffected epigram
hidden in the matter—and a Scotchman is sensitive to an epigram as to
a thistle—some rebellious joke, K." on pit and gallery. ut here is
the official command, as issued from the CHAMBERLAIN’s Office:—
“Lord Chamberlain's Office.
“Sir, I am directed by the Load CHAMBERLAIN to inform you, that in consequence
of complaints having been made to him respecting the introduction of certain cha-
racters or allusions into various scenic representations, to which no reference is
made in the manuscripts submitted for examination, his Lordship directs that in
future all such additions, whether scenic or pantomimic, shall be noted in full on
the manuscript as stage directions.—I am, Sir, your obedient servant, N. H.

It appears, that last season MARSHAL HAYNAU was made the butt
—the brewer’s butt—of the pantomimists, and Austria talked of with-
drawing her ambassador. With impunity, managers become more
audacious; and we have before us—we shall not say how obtained, or
from what theatre it emanated—the MS; of a Pantomime sent to be
licensed by the Chamberlain, with the withering and indignant remarks
of the censor BREADALBANE on the presumptuous production.
The Pantomime was audaciously called—“Harlequin Property-Tair.”
“I consider this title.”—writes the Noble Official—“of a seditious
tendency. The Property-Tax, I am assured of the fact, is to be con-
sidered an everlasting institution of the country. Change title for The
Satisfactory Sevenpence / BREADALBANE.”
“ScENE I.—Street in Lambeth. Bull in a China Shop. Enter a little

At the beginning of the º month the favourite colour was a

The material most in requisition has been Muzzlin', which has been
much worn by members of the Assembly and the writers for the news-

MRS. BAKER'S PET.
AN INTERVAL OF A WEEK OF CONTINUED ANNOYANCE, ARISING MORE
OR LESS REMOTELY FROM THE PET, BETWEEN THIS SCENE AND
THE LAST.
SCENE 4.—The BAKERs have hired a Page. The Pet breaks out in
“ticks,” and means are taken to remove them.
MR. and MRs. BAKER are discovered seated at breakfast, which has now
become a joyless meal, from the grievances ºch the Peº has
established in the family, and which are invariably paraded at
breakfast time,
Mr. Baker. By the way, MRs. BAKER, do you know, I think I
noticed a flea last might.
Mrs. Baker. Oh, stuff! MR. BAKER.
something or other.
Mr. Baker (aggravatingly). I don’t fancy them, I can assure you,
MRs. BAKER. You know how anything of the kind annoys me. There
certainly was a flea-if not several—last night, Mrs. BAKER, Indeed,
I may say I didn’t sleep a wink, in consequence.
Mrs. Baker (in the same pointedly offensive tone). You may say so,
MR. BAKER, of course. But I hope you don’t insist on my believing
it. I’m sure you snored to that degree, the noise quite prevented me
from sleeping.
Mr. Baker (pertinaciously). You are well aware I never do snore,
MRs. BAKER. But of the existence of one, if not more fleas, in the
house, I’m positive; so we may as well drop the subject.
Mrs. Baker (bitterly). Certainly, I’m sure it was not I introduced
it, MR. BAKER. I’m sure I should never have imagined anything so
absurd as fleas in the house. -
Mr. Baker. There, MRs. BAKER! You won't drop the subject, you see.
Mrs. Baker. Because you know perfectly well there never has been
such a thing in any house we have ever been in.
Mr. Baker (eagerly planting his hit at ScAMP). No, MRs. BAKER;
I’m quite aware of that. But there never has been such a thing as a
dog in any house we have been in, neither.
rs. Baker. Oh! of course it’s the dog, as usualſ (With intention).
I suppose, next, it will be that poor dog that brings the smell of cigars
into the house at night... . .
Mr. Baker (with peculiar irritation). Yes, you’d better blame menext
because those puppies of clerks on the outside of the omnibus, will
smoke all the way from the Bank here; as if you didn't know that
there’s nothing I hate in the world so much as the smell of tobacco.
Mrs. Baker. Well, I’m sure I don't wish for any more words on the
subject; but you seem to take a P's. in making words about
everything whatever, now, I’ll tell SPRIggles to look for the flea
You are always fancying
O-clay.
Mr. Baker (in whom the name of SPRIggles appears to wake painful
associations). Ah! there's...that boy, too—that page, that I was fool
enough to let you talk me into *... lazy young vagabond'!
Mrs. Baker (rising with dignity). Before you use language like that,
MR. BAKER, you might remember that I am in the room—
Mr. Baker (rising º: Oh, pray don't trouble yourself to go,
Ma'am—I’m going. I’m glad to say, there’s the omnibus.
Mrs. Baker, Make me feel that your home is distasteful to you, MR.
BAKER—by all means. [Manifests intention of crying.
Mr. * (rushing out). Ah! you’d better accuse me of making it
so, next.
[Erit. He is seen to climb the omnibus with the air of one who
escapes from a disagreeable situation.
Mrs. Baker º out after the omnibus). I’m sure I can’t think
what has come over BAKER. He used to be so easy and good-natured,
and now he’s as snappish, and disagreeable, and peevish, and un-
pleasant in every way.—(A scratching is heard at the door anº, whine.)
Ah! there’s ScAMP. (MRs. BAKER opens the door. ScAMP, who is
now excluded from meals by MR. BAKER’s positive orders—obeyed after a
domestic storm, which all but utterly shattered the fabric of the BAKERs’
married happiness—rushes in, and testifies his delight at the sight of his
mistress, who reciprocates the pleasure). Poor ScAMP poor fellow!
Was it glad to see its mistress, then?-down, there’s a good dog! It
mustn't dirty its mistress's gown so; down, then! Fleas!—I’m sure
he no more has fleas than Mr. BAKER has himself—and he’s particular
enough, I’m sure. . Did its master say that it had fleas? poor dog!
but it hadn't—had it, then? (She feels that ScAMP is dearer than ever
under this unmerited accusation). However, SPRIGGLEs may as well
look. (She rings the bell.) MR. º can’t abide him, either; though
I’m sure he waits very well at table, and is a great convenience in
every way—and understands dogs so well. -
Enter SPRIGGLEs (the BAKERs' recently-hired Page).
[JAMEs SPRIGGLEs is the son of a livery-stable helper; was bred in
a Mews, and educated as a Tiger, till too big for a cab-board;
has every variety of sporting turn, including several very crooked
ones. He professes to understand dogs, and was hired by MRs.
BAKER principally on the strength ºan instinctive attachment
manifested towards him by Scamp. He is a lad of fifteen, with
a precociously wicked face, short hair; and an accurate observer
may detect the Tiger's skin under the Page's buttons.
Mrs. Baker. Oh, SPRIgGLEs! your master thought there was a flea
last night. I wish you'd look when the servants go to make **.
Spriggles (respectfully). Yes,’m.
Mrs. Baker. Your master says it’s the dog, of gourse.
Spriggles. Yes,’m; in course, they will ketch Sºis time o' year.
Mrs. Baker. Why, do you mean that ScAMP has fi

afflicted MRs. BAKER, that ScAMP has an allowance of ticks that
would do credit to an ºſord Freshman at the end ºf his third term.
Mrs. Baker (in agony). Qh! I declare there are quantities of them.
% (cracking one). Yes, there’s a jolly lot-wappers, too!
rs. Baker (anciously). What is to be done, SPRIggies?
§. Well, m, there’s different ways. There's turpentine, 'm,

Mrs. Baker (eagerly). Oh! we won't try that, SPRIGGLEs.
Spriggles. But our guv'nor he always used bakker-water—two ounces
of bakker to aquart of water, ot, and let it stand; and wash 'em twice
well over, and don’t wash it orf till about an hour arter—that’s wot we
always used at the guv'nor's, and that always settled 'em, I know, 'm.
º: Baker. Oh! well-you’re sure you can make it, $prigges?
Spriggles. Oh yes, 'm. -
rs. Baker. And you know where to get the right sort of tobaccof
Spriggles (grinning involuntarily). Well, 'm, Irayther think so.
Mrs. Baker. Then, if you will, SPRIGGLEs—and have it done to-day.
Spriggles. Yes,’m; I’ve got to go to the Libery,’m; and I’ve the
knives and things, and the 'ouse, 'm; but then I will- -
Mrs. Baker. fº, Sºrgºes tºm'sure I hadn't the least idea the
oor thing had fleas. [Erit SPRIGGLEs.]—(With deep compassion.) Poor
cAMP poor dog! ad it nasty fleas, then?
[A lapse of several hours, during which MASTER SPRIGGLEs has been
employed more or less actively in his various avocations. His
visit to the Library, in particular, has taken him a long time, as
he prºſers a circuitous route, ºich takes him a mile out ºf his
road, but enables him to gratify his filial feelings by a call at the
paternal Mews, where there are generally rat-hunts, badger-baits,
or other interesting exhibitions in Natural History, going on.
His visit to the Tobacconist has also occupied some time, as
has taken the opportunity of trying several varieties of tobacco,
no doubt to find out which is fittest for ScAMP's purification.

a large bowl of tobacco-water, the scent of which nearly overpowers MRs. BAKER.

Mr. Baker (in the passage). Eh!—well, I have brought a strong smell in with me

Mr. Baker. Good gracious! what’s this horrid smell?

VARIous titles have been given to Louis Napoleon, and some people have called

the Dictator; but perhaps the best.title to give him, in allusion to the game he
has been playing, would be that of Unlimited #.

A BIT OF REAL ACTING.
READER—in these days of bald burlesque and fast farce
—do you enjoy a bit of genuine acting : A touch of art,
that is not dealt with a rolling-pin—a point, not made by
the elbow of one actor in the stomach of his brother wagº
You do? Then go and see CHARLEs MATHEws in Mr.
Affable Hawk. It is the triumph of effrontery: the alchemy
of impudence, turning brass to gold. Hawk has the cool
purpose, the subtlety of self-assured genius. The swindler
is enlarged, into a great moral presence. His sophistry
makes his black quite as candid as his neighbour's white.
The heart-strings of his victims—scamps like himself-are
their purse-strings; and with fingers, so light, they would
not brush the meal from wing of butterfly, Hawk twitches
and draws them. You almost pity his creditors—rascals
though they be—they are such babes and sucklings in the
presence of theirresistible borrower. He would, beguiling
the snake, coaxa rabbit from the folds of a boa. A creditor
enters, a coarse abusive rascal. Hawk presents to him
that serene face, that ample brow brazen as a door-plate;
and, at a word, the brute is the most obsequious of lenders.
Another whining creditor appeals to Hawk's compassion;
and, dropping upon the hypocrite with the softest swoop,
Hawk's bill is again among his feathers. Nothing is
safe from Mr. Affable Hawk, impressed by *ś and
fine art of the actor. The goose that had already laid her
one daily golden egg, beguiled by Affable, could not have
refused to retreat to her nest and lay him a second.
A BATCH OF INSULTS.
Nobody does know, nobody can know, and nobody ever
will know, what we are obliged to suffer from the hands of
a set of persons who are always stabbing us in the dark
through our letter-box. For example: we have been asked,
at this festive season of the year—and we confessit has
“a little dashed our spirits” to have the º ut to us
—“What is the antithesis to good natured 2–Good art-ed.”
We had scarcely recayered from the shock offered to our
feelings by the above outrage, when we were laid prostrate
by the following:-
“Why are persons born blind unfit to be carpenters?-
Because they neversaw.”
We do not know what we have done to deserve all this;
but we lay it before the public, that it may be seen what we
have to endure in the service of our country.
Solo for a Civic Festival.
Flow on, thou tidal River!
But ere thou reach the sea,
Turn back to Town, and give her
Back all she casts in thee.
Along thine oozy borders,
Corrupt and taint her blood,
Diffusing dire disorders
From foul malarious mud!
Louis Napoleon's new Legion.
Louis NApoleon, following, after a fashion, in the steps
of his uncle, has instituted a Legion of Dishonour. This
is the regiment which so gallantly fired at the windows of
unarmed citizens. As yet, however, this new order of
chivalry is unprovided with a cordon, as there is º:
that would be suitable to it; and they manage these things
differently in France, where the reward of wilful and
deliberate murder is not a halter.
The Light of all Nations.
FRANCE is like the Sun. Her brilliancy is Glory. She
resembles the Sun, becausesheisthe centre of the European
system. All the States of the Continent move around her,
as planets round the solar luminary.
In the mean time France, fixed in her splendid position,
yet rotating on her own axis, exists in a continual state
of revolution, without ever getting on.
THE FREnch PREsident's DRILL.
So completely is France a military nation, that bodies
of its private citizens even, have been drilled by Louis
NApoleon—with bullets.
