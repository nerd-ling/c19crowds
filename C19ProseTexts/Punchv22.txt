INCE the days of the illustrious ANDREw MARVELL, MR. PUNCH is the first paid M.P.-that is, Member
for PUNCH-who, being paid, has sedulously given all his heart and all his soul to the interests of his
many thousands of Constituents. To be sure, the salary of MR. PUNch as M.P. is but small—an incon-
siderable threepence per head per week;-but it is the principle enshrined in that unassuming threepence
that makes the wages a glory and an honour. Not the money, but the sentiment of the money; not the
flower, but the odour that is the soul of the flower.
At this time, when some thousand English gentlemen—we will say a thousand—are standing before
their country; indeed, not so much standing as kneeling before it, with their right hands on their waistcoats,
and their left upraised, protesting that they have no such earthly hope as the hope that shall carry them to
the House of Winds, in Westminster; at such a time, with such a rivalry without, MR. PUNch does feel
even more than his usual complacency in his back parlour, knowing that without raising himself the eighth
of an inch from his easy chair, that without even purchasing an inch of ribbon, blue or yellow (the blue
to show his love of Truth, the truth of the Hustings having, time out of mind, been beaten blue; the
yellow, to show his contempt of the gold of the Minister), MR. Punch will be returned as M.P. for the
whole empire; elected as the supplementary Six Hundred and Fifty-Ninth Member and Moderator of the
old, acknowledged, constitutional 658. And this, without any effort on his part; with no treating, no music;
with not so much as the froth of one bottle of ginger-beer; without one note from a hireling trumpet.
Now this was the belief simmering in the heart of PUNch : such was the philosophical calmness in
which—as in his easy morning-gown—he was clothed from shoulders to heel, when it was announced to him
by his Boy, who has seen so much of what are called the first people of the day, that from a lively child,
the poor fellow has become absolutely dull—that a Deputation of the Empire was down stairs (at least the
head of the Deputation; for it was long as the Sea-Snake, and with merely its head in No. 85 Fleet

iv. PREFACE.
Street: its tail, in which were joints from India and all the Colonies, was curling round Charing-Cross)—and
pressed in the urgent manner, usual with Deputations, for an interview.
“There's no help for it,” thought PUNch ; and so, calling into his face that sympathetic, benevolent,
protective look that he once saw illumine the features of DER BY when, as the Farmer's Friend, he assured
the men of Chawbeans-cum-Bacon, that they should have justice, and that wheat should be anything they
liked a quarter—with this hopeful and paternal smile upon his features, MR. PUNch received the Head of
the Deputation.
“Gentlemen,” said PUNch, resolved to be short, “ of course I shall continue to represent you. Go
home, be happy, and make yourselves easy on that point. I shall not speak of my principles. The
One-and-Twenty Volumes of my life 22
(“Two-and-Twenty,” said our boy, in correction.)
“That is, the Two-and-Twenty—for on this day appears the Twenty-Second * (the Head of the
Deputation seemed duly impressed with the fact)—“lie open before you. The Works of my Life! Turn
over the leaves, gentlemen : lay your finger if you can upon any violation of any principle. There,
gentlemen, in black and white, are the eleven important years of my existence; years dedicated to your
service—and, through you, to the service, and solace, and satisfaction of the world.
“Gentlemen, I am the Paid Member for all England. The only Paid Member. Every man has
his price. The price of PUNch is Threepence—Fourpence stamped.
“I do not know, gentlemen, that I can add anything to this agreeable fact. Of course, I wish
every year to be worthier of your confidence—your admiration : but I do not see how it is to be done.
The possibility of the thing, as MR. Disit AELI says of Protection, seems to loom in the future ; but further
than the possibility, anything more than seeming—with MR. DiskAELI–I cannot even venture to predict.
“You will, therefore, gentlemen, receive the assurance of my distinguished consideration; and
with it, the conviction that during the next Parliament—and all Parliaments to be continued—MR. PUNch
will be at his post.”
Next morning, I read in the Times that “the Deputation took their leave of the Hon. Gentleman,
highly satisfied with his condescension, and with the very flattering result of their interview.”

PUNCH*S EVERY-DAY BOOK.
January.—This month derives its name from JANUs, who had two
faces, one sad, and the other smiling; the former contemplating the
Christmas Bills, the latter looking on at the festivities of the season.
In ancient prints, January is sometimes represented as a veteran with
a woodman's axe—perhaps the identical one that the old year has just
cut his stick with.
January 1st.—The practice of giving presents on New Year's Day is
as old as the Romans, who gave each other figs and dates;, but the
precise date cannot be ascertained, nor is the earliest fig to be found
in any collection of facts and figures. In Queen ElizaBETH's time,
all the royal servants presented Her Majesty with gifts, and her pastry-
cook gave her some tarts; but in these days puffs are, happily, not
acceptable to royalty.
Suitors in the Courts of Law º gave gloves as New Year's
Gifts to the Judges, who, as they did not always come into court with
clean hands, found the gift acceptable.
The First of º is dedicated, in the Roman Calendar, to ST.
Fulgentius, who used to walk barefooted, to the great injury of his
sole, and who, never eating meat, lived upon |. which reduced his
own }. to a state of extreme feebleness. Though his only food con-
sisted entirely of vegetables, he reached a green old age, which was,
perhaps, natural.
January 2nd.—This day is dedicated by the Roman Catholics, to
St. MACARIUs, who was once stung by a gnat, which he killed inadver-
tently. The Saint went into the marshes to do penance, when he was
stung by so many flies, that his body was covered with tumors, and he
came back such a thorough swell that nobody knew him.
A Card from the Protectionist Waits.
WE, your Protectionist dead weights, make our usual petition, and
return to the old song at this festive period. We beg to remind you
that we have no connexion with the Pope's brass band, or any other
instruments of humbug, except our own, which we continue to play
upon.

LEICESTER SQUARE CONSPIRATORS,
The continental despots have been, it is said, remonstrating with our Government for
harbouring revolutionary refugees. This is a very ºf complaint; for there is no
place in the world where the anarchists are so likely to learn the principles of order as they
are here; no atmosphere in which Red men so soon change their colour, and acquire a reve-
rence for the policeman. Members of the “Mountain,” after ayery brief enjoyment of English
quiet, look with the same respect at our constables' staves, as their countrymen at home at the
not much more brilliant, and much less efficient, staff which surrounds the French President.
As to any plots that exotic democrats may hatch, we believe they are as harmless as the incu-
bation which is carried on in the neighbourhood of the exiles by MR. CANTELo in Leicester
Square. For the satisfaction of the ambassadors of arbitrary powers, MR. CANTELo might add
to his present establishment an exhibition of Socialist º&º: conspirators hatchin
lots by smoke. Such º; never comes to anything; no chickens are produced in Englan
rom what may be termed Gallic cocks' eggs.
i.
THE REPRESENTATION OF WEST-
MINSTER.
We congratulate Westminster on the state of
its Representation. What we say is no compli-
ment to the constituents of Evans, or Lush-
INGTON. It is a just tribute to MEssieurs
PARMeno, PHAEDRIA, GNATHo, CHAEEA, Thraso,
DoRIAs, to M** THAIs and PYTHIAs, and to
the rest of the young amateurs, who have been
earning all the laurels that Christmas can muster,
º º: the Eunuchus of TERENCE. We
ude, in fact, to the Westminster Play—not
to the Westminster electors. We witnessed that
performance with a vast deal of pleasure, con-
siderably heightened by the profound conviction
that the actors would hereafter acquit themselves
quite as creditably in the parts of physicians,
barristers, judges, bishops, captains, colonels,
field-marshals, members of parliament, mer-
chants, and other leading characters, on the more
serious boards of real life.
If some ancient Roman could have arisen
ſrom the Shades, and exchanged the pleasures
of the Élysian fields for the gratification of
witnessing TERENCE, as interpreted by the West-
minster scholars, he would, no doubt, have been
considerably more amused than he ever was by
the same play in his own time and country. For
the levities of the Latin MoMUs are somewhat
º: and we suspect that much more
un was got out of our author, in the dormitory
of Westminster school, than ever was elicited
from him on the Roman stage. Indeed, the
Westminster boys turn a dormitory into a the-
atre, and we suspect that the ancient Romans
did precisely the reverse.
efervently hope that some of our humbler
British dramatists may have witnessed the
Eunuchus of TERENCE, as the performance might
have suggested to them a flattering idea of the
immortality which may be reserved for a fifth-
rate comedy, “adapted from the French.” It
is strange that a play should have so long
survived wherein there is little that is remark-
able except the plot—that being remarkable only
from the circumstance that the young actors,
with all their scholarship, could not possibly
translate it to their sisters, insomuch that the
virtuous LoRD CHAMBERLAIN would, probably,
refuse to allow such a piece to be performed in
plain English.
But what would be too gross for the Coburg,
is delicate enough for youths and maidens, when
“veiled in the decent obscurity of a dead
language;” so the doctors have decided, and it
is not for Punch to say may; though our young
Thespians enunciate the language of TERENCE
too nicely to permit us to question, that they
know perfectly well what they are saying.
POSERS FOR THE ADMIRALTY.
The Lords of the Admiralty are entreated to
give their serious attention to the following ques-
tions:-
In wearing a ship, is the ship always put on?
Whereabouts is the binnacle?
How do you get to the top-gallant forecastle?
What part of a vessel are the beam-ends?
It is earnestly hoped that their Lordships will
endeavour to acquire, in regard to the points
above specified, those clear and accurate views
which are so necessary in the direction of nautical
affairs, and especially in the regulation of naval
architecture; as it is very desirable that no more
mistakes should occur in the enlargement and
repair of our wooden walls which the dangerous
state of affairs on the Continent may render
necessary.

GOG’S PIROUETTE.
DOGGEREL FOR DIRTY DOGS.
GREAT Gog was a mighty Giant,
And his meals cost thousands of pounds,
For his paunch was huge and pliant,
And his appetite knew no bounds.
He cared not although the Gout
Had caused him to limp and hobble,
But still would he blow himself out,
Swig, swig, and gobble, gobble.
Old Gog, being blithe and merry,
Took a hop on his gouty toe,
In the fulness of port and sherry,
And tremendously laughed, Ho, ho!
He stood in St. Martin's le Grand
At the close of a banquet splendid,
Over twenty miles of land
His left leg he extended.
Full twenty miles—no shorter!—
He gave a twist and a twirl,
And, fixed on his right supporter,
Spun round like a dancing girl!
This wonderful pirouette
Was considered by the City
As a ſeat, which to forget
Would be an eternal pity.
So they came to the decision,
That the circle GoG had traced
Should afford him a provision .
To increase his monstrous waist.
In the space he compassed, tolls
They obtained the right to levy
On HER MAJESTY's subjects' coals,
Which is why they come so heavy.
The Hack Blade of the Protectionists.
MR. BALL (of Buwell) asked of the Protectionist Meet-
ing at the London Tavern, if
“There was any man whose sword had been more notched than MR.
DishAEli's 2"
We do not see that a sword is any the better for being so
dreadfully notched, unless, it is for the purpose of turning
it into a saw ; and Protection is not exactly celebrated for
its “wise saws.” We º MR. BALL wanted the
farmers to believe that MR. DiskAELI was a first-rate
blade, only with a number of notches; and in our opinion,
the worst notch in the Blade is the notch of Protection.
THE MARBLE ARCH.
. SHAKspEARE, has taught us to read “sermons in stones;” and most
significant are the sermons to be found in every bit of the Marble Arch,
in its origin and its late removal. When first erected by GEORGE THE
FourTH, it preached to us a Royal Sermon; discoursing to tax-paying
Englishmen the magnificent contempt of their gorgeous potentate for
the vulgarity of cash expense. Not a marble block that had not atongue
in it, e ... talking to apprehensive ears, of the barbaric taste—
(costly and monstrous as a rich jewel in the nose of an Ethiopian prince)
—of the selfish prodigality of GeoRGE THE Fourth, now fast on his
way to oblivion. The spendſhriſt king was, in the fulness of time, set
aside on his shelf in St. George's hapel, and still the Marble Arch
held forth a continual sermon on the folly and wastefulness of its dead
projector. At length the Arch is to be removed; to be tumbled down,
and on some most º: site, where the marble shall, architectur-
ally, sound a most harmonious key to the scene, to be again set up.
Happily, or oddly enough, the Marble Arch is carted from St. James's
#º block § block put together again where its beauties may
come full upon the house of the present Duke of SoMERSET; the house
of the future Duke, now the Minister for Woods and Forests' Surely,
we can read a sermon in the marble on this final incident. But here is
another sermon—a sermon with £ s. d. for the text—quoted from the
newspapers :-
“THE MARBLE ARch.—From an official document just issued, it is shown that the
º& taking down, removing, and re-instating the Marble Arch, was little short of
Had this sum, together with the proceeds of the old marble, been
granted to Doctor LAYARD, who, starved by the Government, has been
compelled for awhile to give up ſurther excavation in Assyria, we do
not think it impossible that exhumed treasures, a few more winged
bulls, would have given us something better for our money than the
restored blunder, the huge bull of GEORGE THE Fourth.
However, the government has a venerating sympathy for the pro-
fligate extravagance of the Sybarite, GEORGE, and, at the cost of
£11,000, will perpetuate it... On the other hand, what will the Govern-
ment subscribe towards the means of preserving one WILLIAM
SHAKSPEARE's house? The Art Union shall tell us:-
“SHAkspeaRR's House.—The Government have refused to take upon themselves the
guardianship of the birth-place of the poet of England; the debt of £400 still remains
unliquidated by the committee who effected its purchase; affairs are, therefore, in
statu quo.”
The account then stands thus:-

of shame and indignation?

Throwing your Money into the Gutter.
It has been said that “the man who goes to law might as well throw
his money into the gutter.” Now the Commissioners of Sewers have
been going to law; and, in so doing, have spent no less a sum than
£5800, which, for . good which it has done the Commissioners or the
Sewers, might as well have been thrown into the gutter. It strikes us
strongly that the public, money was entrusted to them to throw into
more profitable gutters than that of going to law I

THE POLITICAL CROTCHET-BOOK.
A Young gentleman who (in a
state of infatuation), has
recently been meddling
with those *: little
works calle Crochet.
Books, has suddenly con-
ceived the idea o pro-
ducing a book of a similar
character to illustrate the
working of PoliticAL
CRotchets. In the pre-
sent state of European
affairs the art is a very
useful one. . -
The following is a speci-
men of his performance;
the tºwn is clearly
French:—
“PATTERN, No.—
For EDGING—towards
absolute power. Make
a chain of sausages of
the length required, allow-
; ing a quarter of a pound
of pork to each sausage;
turn back (from your
oath) and work the-
“First Row of bayonets. Pass the row up and down the street.
Work the bayonet through the front entrances of houses, and out at
the back windows—which will make your pattern firm. Loop up your
generals, and cut off communication between the different ends of your
coun
--
try.
$. This pattern is tolerably simple, and chiefly requires that the
bayonet shall be of the regulation size, -
“After the First Row of bayonets has been brought into form, a
Second Row (pronounced to rhyme with “vow”) will require to be
arranged for. Various other rows will have to follow; the general
directions, however, for dealing with all of them, are as follows:
“4th, 5th, and 6th Row. Continue rººf the bayonet as before;
work 1 plain (act of force); 2, or more, doubles (of falsehood); 2 hooks
(of representatives by bribery); repeat to the end.
“So the work must go forward “to the end,” when your absolute
Crotchet will be pretty completely done to your satisfaction. The
colour of the stuff will be blood colour.”
Query by Professor Punch.-Will it wash?
THE POETRY OF COOKERY.
ConsIDERING the high position that Cookery has lately taken among
the arts, we feel, that there is a demand for something more than the
mere prose in which the science has been hitherto taught, and we beg
to offer a few specimens of a
POETICAL COOKERY BOOK.
IRISE STEW,
Ann.-"Happy Land.”
Irish stew, Irish stew
Whatever else my dinner be,
Once again, once again,
I’d have a dish of thee.
Mutton chops, and onion slice,
Let the water cover,
With potatoes, fresh and mice;
Boil, but not quite over,
Irish stew, Irish stew
Ne'er from thee, my taste will stray.
i could eat
N i. a º
early every day.
i. la, la, la!
CALF'S HEART.
'Air.—“Maid of Athens, ere we part."
Maid of all work, as a part
Of my dinner, cook a heart;
Or since such a dish is best;
Give me that, and leave the rest.
Take my orders, ere I go;
Heart of calf, we'll cook thee so,
Buy—to price you’re not confined—
Such a heart as suits your mind:
Buy some suet—and enough
Of the herbs required to stuff;
Buy some lemon-peel-and, oh!
Heart of calf, we’ll fill thee so.
Buy some onions—just a taste-
Buy enough, but not to waste;
Buy two eggs, of slender shell,
Mix, and stir the mixture well;
Crumbs of bread among it throw ;
Heart of calf, we'll roast thee so.
Maid of all work, when 'tis done,
Serve it up to me alone;.
Rich brown gravy round it roll,
Marred by no intruding coal;
Currant jelly add—and, lo!
Heart of calf, I'll eat thee so.
THE CHRISTMAS PUIDDING.
AiR.—“Jeannette and Jeannot."
If you wish to make the pudding in which every one delights,
Of a dozen new-laid eggs you must take the yolks and whites;
Beat them well up in a basin till they thoroughly combine,
And shred and chop some suet up particularly fine;
Take a pound of well-stoned raisins, and a pound of currants dried,
A pound of pounded sugar, and a pound of peel beside;
Stir them all up well together with a pound of wheaten flour,
And let them stand to settle for a quarter of an hour;
Then tie the pudding in a cloth, and put it in the pot, -
Some people like the water cold, and some prefer it hot; -
But though I don't know which of these two methods I should praise,
I know it ought to boil an hour for every pound it weighs.
Oh! if I were Queen of France, or, still better, Pope of Rome,
I'd have a Christmas º: every day I dined at home;
And as for other puddings, whatever they might be,
Why those who like the nasty things should eat them all for me.
THE “PAIL” OF CIVILISATION;
AND HOW IT IS FILLED DIFFERENTLY BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE,
The Rich Man fills it with champagne, and the best spirits, and the
warmest cordials; and the Poor Man with gruel, or beer, or vegetables,
or whatever scraps he can throw into it.
..With the Benevolent, it is a large Milk-pail, overflowing with human
kindness' with the Selfish, it is nothing better than a monster Ice-pail
to freeze everything that is put into it.
The Teetotaller deluges it with Tea—and so does the Washerwoman
—and also a large number of ladies; but the Hospitable Man, who is
neither in his tastes a Teetotaller, nor a Washerwoman, fills it to
overflowing with generous wine, which he invites his friends to come
and enjoy with him.
The melancholy Drunkard replenishes it, time after time, with Gin,
or Brandy, or Whiskey-and-water, or spirits of some sort; but the
Sober Man is perfectly content if it contains nothing stronger for his
palate than Toast-and-Water.
Those who are Charitable fill it with Soup, which they give away to
the Poor; and those who combine Charity with Politics, fill it with
Stones, which, they tell the Poor, as soon as they are broken, shall be
exchanged for so many loaves of bread. . -
With the Good, the Pail of Civilisation is one large, loving cup, which
they pass round and round, inviting every one to drink, and pledge his
neighbour in fellowship; with the Bad, it is an impure vessel of strong
and maddening drinks that debase all those who Fº their lips to it.
To Some it is a fountain of Purity, filled with the sweetest waters
drawn from the Well of Truth; to Others it is a deadly, poison cup
which, offered treacherously in the holy name of Civilisation, is mo
death to all who taste it.
But the day will surely come when the “Pail” of Civilisation will be a
source of goodness and health to all who partake of it; and, though it
may be a long time before Civilisation will be able to get all Mankind
to drink out of the same “Pail,” yet that day will assuredly come, and
we only hope that we may be there in order to have, what is vulgarly
called, a “good long pull” out of it!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 9
A CHRISTIAN OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND.
THE Caernarvon Herald says:—
“The death of the Rev. George Robsox, of Erbistock, near Wrexham, will cause a
number of vacancies in this neighbourhood in situations which he had held for a great
number of years. It is supposed that, since his nomuination by Bishop HASELEY, he
has raised £100,000 from the livings he held.”
That is held to be the best epitaph that most briefly, most touchingly
reveals to the contemplative reader the virtues that, adorned him
living, who now reposes below. The fewer the syllables the better.
We know nothing of, the Rev. GeoRGE Robson; nothing of the
manifold excellencies that were, no doubt, lustrous in him while he
dwelt in the flesh. ... Still, our notions of the simplicity, the self-denying
attributes of Christianity, as propounded in the New Testament (if not
in the the Clergy List), are somewhat shocked by the contemplation of
that ecclesiastical monstrosity, called a pluralist. . In the Hindoo
§ we see all sorts of divinities hideously pictured; some with
half-a-dozen heads, others with a score of legs and arms; and these,
monstrous as they are, we take to be the true signification—the vera
effigies of a reverend pluralist. But surely the Rev. GEORGE ROBSON
had only one head, two arms, a pair of legs? We suppose he would
not have been a profitable investment for a showman, but was doubtless
a mere simple biped, after the common fashion of biped humanity.
How, then, must he have been puzzled to fill a “number” of “situa-
tions?” With half a dozen heads he might at once have preached half-
a dozen sermons. With three pair of arms he might have held six books.
There would have been something like a physical adaptability to his
moral and religious duties; but as GeoRGE Robson doubtless lived and
died a plain man, how the poor churchman must at times have been
uzzled by the plural calls upon his single ability! We had better
eave pluralities to Vishnoo, and, as Christians, work in simplicity.
However, touching the epitaphs of pluralists: hiſ might be made
most instructive. or instance, we would have the principal line
supplied by Doctors' Commons. The will proved, we would have the
epitaph run thus:-

ruined in hair-dye. -
“I think I am entitled to ask you to ask the Aldermen a few

“Why is he so very punctual at the dinner-table, and so regularly

or MAgog, or the §. in the City Arms? Is his an institution
similar to that established by his dear Smithfield, for prize purposes?
and is it intended that he should graduate in civic honours, simply by

RAMPANT BULLS IN PORTUGAL.
THE foreign correspondent of the Morning Post, writing on the
affairs of Portugal, informs us that
“The Government has now resorted to a most scandalous mode of getting some
money. A bull has been published, allowing people to eat eggs, cheese, drink milk,
&c., during Lent, moyennant the payment of a sum of money.”
The authority by which we understand this “bull” to have been
published, is that of the papal nuncio, who might very properly be
styled, in short, nunkey, the diminutive of uncle, not only because he
is, ecclesiastically speaking, the brother of Papa or the Pope; but also
because he appears, virtually, to have assumed the symbol of the
“three balls,” and the motto of "Mome Lent.”
Our contemporary’s correspondent subjoins-
“It is, moreover, wished that a greater latitude should be
to say, that the abstinence from flesh be completely dispen
the price of the bulls would be risen (sic)."
No doubt the price of bulls would be “risen,” or, as, we should
rather say, raised, if the abstinence from flesh were dispensed with; that
is, if the Portuguese eat beef. But all this kind of thing should—
especially at the present season of the year-make us thankful to reflect
that John BuLL is a Bull to himself, and is not to be bullied by any
papal or other bull, either out of his cash or out of his dinner.

DEPARTUREs.-A clever contemporary al-
ludes to the departure of Monsieur THIERs

NEW YEAR'S GIFTS TO LOUIS NAPOLEON.
The following Etrennes were presented at the Elysée to Louis
Apoleon, on the Jour de l'An:—
The Elite of the Army presented him, with an enormous Báton—en
Sucre de Pomme—as a complimentary hint of his rapid promotion
(service not being necessary in the nephew of an Emperor) to the
rank of Maréchal de l'Empire.
The KING OF NAPLEs sent him a monster cake, enveloped in a beau:
tiful sulphur bag, of the very finest Naples º in order that he might
wash his hands of the filthy Socialist blood, which must be (says the King,
in an autograph letter,) “une titche bien difficile et bien désagréable.”
The Emperon of Russia forwarded him in frosted silver, the pret-
liest Model of the Mines of Siberia, with a friendly intimation that the
the hilt.
originals were quite at his service for any political purposes.
The EMPEROR of Austria, animated by the same affectionate
motives, begged of his “cher frère Louis” to accept of an Eilwagen-full
of ºi..., with an assurance that “if he wanted more, he
might have them.” The bank-notes averaged, from twopence down-
wards, and were pierced through and through, like larks on a spit, with
bayonets. The pointed meaning of this, as explained }. a Police-
General, who ...} been on active duty lately on the Stock Exchange at
Vienna, was that “in the event of wry faces being made in swallowing
#: bank-notes, the bayonets were to force them down the people's
throats.”
The Pope sent him, curiously enough, a splendid leg of mutton, which
was flanked by a magnificent Sword, with the Agnus Dei in diamonds on
Down the blade were engraved, the following talismanic
words: “Let all thy cutting and carving be directed to one end—that
of winning the Pope's eye.” - -
The KING OF THE CANNIBAL Islands merely sent his Portrait.
The EMPEROR SouLoupe THE FIRST, of Madagascar, directed to the
Elysée, for the acceptance of “his loving brother NAPOLEoN,” a large
Imperial Crown, most highly wrought in gingerbread. ... A manuscript
letter of the Emperor's accompanied it, tendering, in the handsomest
manner, “the use of his personal services, and that of his brave army.”
And lastly, LEs DAMES DE LA HALLE attended in a body of five
hundred, and presented Louis NAPOLEoN with a most tasty model, as
large as life, of the Emperor, worked into a tremendous Brioche. The
President nearly shed tears at the neatness of the compliment, and
Fººd the Cake, with every symptom of the warmest sympathy, to his
eart. After the Goutte d'Honneur had been offered and accepted
several times, the five hundred ladies retired, shouting, in the most
cordial spirit, “Wire l’Empereur /*

Year's Gift of the series, and was the one which, we are credibly
informed, gave the greatest surprise, as well as the greatest pleasure, to

A “Great Criminal.”
IN November, 1850, Louis NApoleon declared in his message to the
National Assembly of France, that—
“He considered as GREAT criminals those who, by PERsonAL AMortion, compromised
the small amount of stability secured by the Constitution.”
Those words we recommended Louis NAPoleon, at the time (p. 222,
vol. xix.), to have engrayed in large letters over the portico, and every
door of the *:: ; so that, being constantly before his recollection, he
might never, be guilty of “personal ambition,” and so never figure in
history as a “GREAT CRIMINAL.” We are afraid he has forgotten our
friendly advice; and what has been the consequence P. Why, he “has
compromised the small amount of stability secured by the Constitution,”
and, in his own words, is branded as a “Great Criminal.” As such we
recommend AME TUssaud to include him, as one of its fittest
members, in her “Chamber of Horrors.”
A FRENCH Coo.-A Cockney correspondent suggests, that as Louis
NAPOLEoN has so well succeeded in his coup, he should discard the
Eagle as a cognisance, and assume the Dove.

Poor France has just furnished another illustration of the results, of fatal curiosity. She had a
younger sister, º growing not very rapidly; but being, tolerably sure of gaining strength and
Hºf maturity, if she was allowed to lead a quiet and regular life, when all of a sudden the sisters
ſound themselves betrayed into the hands of a very bad set of people. Liberty being freed from all whole-
some restraint, indulged in every kind of excess; until, worn out by her irregular course of life, she was
glad to form the first alliance that seemed to offer anything in the shape of a permanent establishment;
and she tº gave herself into the hands of the modern Blue Beard. For some time he seeme
to treat her kindly enough; but when she and her sister, La Presse, began to be actuated by a spirit of
curiosity as to the future, he, without any scruple, determined to make an end of that Liberty who
had placed herself in his hands, and whom he had sworn to protect and to honour. With a drawn
sword he stood over her, threatening to administer her death-blow, while her sister looked out anxiously
in the hope of seeing some one approach to their rescue. Such is the present situation of poor Liberty;
and weregret we are unable to give a favourable reply to the vitalquestion, “Do you see anybody coming?”
THE PALMERSTON FEAST
No sooner was it known that LoRD PALMERston had ceased to belong to the Cabinet (that Hamlet was
withdrawn from the play of Hamlet), than various of the Foreign Ambassadors determined upon having a
banquet to celebrate an event that, as they instinctively felt, must be so peculiarly gratifying to the
feelings of their several royal masters. The feast was not so magnificent, so complete, as under other
circumstances it might have been; but the joy and hearty good-will of the revellers more than.com-
Fº for any short-coming of the cook; and, perhaps, throughout the country, there was not a jollier
hristmas party than that Fº together under the roof of his Excellency the Ambassador for —,
who flung open the doors of his spacious and magnificent mansion on the occasion. - -
As the various Ambassadors entered and embraced the host, the band played (in touching compliment
to the EMPERoR Nicholas) God preserve the Emperor! The meeting of the parties was very interesting
-even affecting. Austria rushed into the arms of Russia, and both embraced with emotion; whilst
GREECE all but melted on the shoulder of the Two Sicilies.
The dinner being over, Russia rose to propose a toast. They had that day, met to celebrate an
event of peculiar interest to all strong Governments (cheers): he trusted they knew what he meant
by strong Governments. (Cheers and smiles.) They were now assured of the removal of a man who
had in the most insolent, manner defied the will of Russia—the wish of Austria—the desire of Naples
-and the hopes of the Two Sicilies: , of a man of most dangerous character; for it so happened that
he never put a bold front upon a question that, somehow, or the other, he didn't carry it to a triumphant
issue. But the sun of PALMERsion was set; and already he heard the satisfied growl of the Northern
Bear—the rejoicing scream of the Austrian Eagle, in conclusion, he would give them the “Balance
of Power;” by which he meant a torn and tattered constitution in one scale, with the down-weighing
sword of his master in the other. (Cheers.)
Two Sicilies gave the next toast; “A Speedy Rise in the Sulphur Market.” . He felt that the
removal of the pestilent PALMERston was a great boon to universal despotism; and, connected as he
believed despotism to be with the briskest trade in sulphur, he felt that both despotism and brimstone
had been materially served by the disgrace and discomfiture of Lord PALMERston. His downfall was
a great day for Europe; and the news would lighten the large, heart of the King of NAPLES; a heart
!.as the largest bomb-shell; it would carry confusion and despair into the dungeons of political
traitors.
FRANCE was called upon for a toast; but excused himself: his feelings, he said, could be better
conceived than described; and though
he had felt it a duty to be present on
the occasion, he had heard nothing
through the electric telegraph since
the retirement of the Minister. He,
however, had no doubt that his master
the Emp-- he meant the President,
would on all occasions be found unani-
mous with Austria and Russia.
GREECE attempted to give utterance
to his feelings; but entirely failed
further than to express a mingle
satisfaction and regret-satisfaction
that that firebrand of the world,
PALMERston, was at last put out, -
regret that (he would no further allude
to the PACIFIco question)—he was not
extinguished long ago. -
PRussia (admirably representing
Prussia's monarch) made a speech; but
from the mysticism that pervaded it,
our Reporter cannot venture to say
whether PRussia approved or disap:
proved; hoped anything or regretted
anything; promised or desired any-
thing. Neither was it plain to our
Reporter whether Prussia gave a toast
or chanted a sentiment. -
After a while the conversation drih-
bled into small-talk; and as the wine
went round, many innuendoes were
cast upon the absent. AMERICA had
sent an excuse; was going out to a
quiet game at whist. BELGIUM was
entertaining a happy juvenile party;
SARDINIA was previously engaged;
whilst SPAIN, Portugal, and the
NETHERLANDs were ill with the in-
fluenza.
However, the festivity was kept up
with increasing spirit; and it was not
until a very late . that the guests
(a few of them flushed with wine
and hope) º Several of them
embraced with expressions of mutual
º and support.
e had almost forgotten to state
that an effigy of Lond PALMenston
was burnt in the court-yard of the
house of the ambassadorial host; all
the company, one feeling animatin
them, dancing hand-in-hand (“linke
slav'ry, long drawn out,”) around the
conflagration.
Disraeli in a Pickle.
In speaking of DiskAELI’s “political
biography” of Lord GeoRGE BEN-
Tinck, the Times, in allusion to what
it calls the “vain attempt to sanctify
paltry feelings,” asks "why all this
stuff is to be reprinted?” and adds,
“flies in amber are pretty enough, but
a scorpion in spirits is only to be tole-
rated in a museum.”...Our contem-
porary should have said, “a scorpion
out of spirits;” for the work, besides
being rather venomous towardspolitical
antagonists, is insufferably dull.
Freedom of Election in
France.
The next edition of the Almanacks
will, we trust, contain an addition to
the names ofthe Potentates of Europe,
and besides the Elector of this or that
small state, we shall expect to see
the announcement of Hobson as Elector
of France; for there cannot be the
slightest doubt that Louis Napoleon
is Hobson's choice.

FUNNY MARKET AND WITTY INTELLIGENCE.
E regret to say the Funny
Market has been heavy,
in consequence of all the
Christmas orders having
been executed, and many
of the goods—bads and
indifferents—not having
gone off with the public
so well as the dealers had
expected. Some of the
retailers *: to have
overstocked themselves
with the inferior sort of
jokes, and several sample
packets—including half-
a-dozen comundrums, half-a-dozen puns, with an anecdote and a charade
in verse, for one guinea the packet—have remained on hand; and
until Twelfth Night comes round, there is no chance of a market:
The regular #. complain very bitterly of the practice that is now
so prevalent among the public, of making their own jokes at home, or
leaving the business in the hands of a domestic wag—a class, of which
there is now one in nearly every family. A professed punster who has
been in the habit of receiving more invitations than he could attend to
at this season of the year, assures us that he with difficultyNº up a
dinner on Christmas Day, and that his engagements for New Year's
Eve will scarcely pay for his lemon-coloured kid gloves,...and.the
washing of his white waistcoat. . An old wag assures us that if he
were to confine himself to the legitimate business of facetide, there
would be nothing for him to do; and that he, only manages to make
both ends meet, by adding conjuring tricks and the corneº-piston tº
the more regular branches of his profession. A well-known “funny dog,”
who did a great deal in the Ethiopian Serenader line, even up to last
ear, has found so little encouragement, that he intends washing his
ſº —and face—of the whole concern, and selling of his bones at
5ft for twopence—the regular marine-store price—as soon as possible.

CHRONICLES OF 1854.—NOTABILIA.
Jan. 1st. THE first penny train started ſrom Westminster, Bridge to
London Bridge, and walked the arches “like a thing of life,” stopping
at ſhe intermediate bridges.
5th. Great commotion at the Parliament Stairs and Pedlar's Acre, on
the breaking of the W. temporary bridge, which was erecte
on the site of old Westminster Bridge, now fallen foul of Father
Thames. Five hundred souls, seven omnibuses, four brewers' drays, and
ten Pagoda advertising-vans immersed; the bodies whereof would have
been lost but for the prevailing custom of wearing, Aykbourne's
Liſe-Buoys. The Watermen's Company of Steamers, laid up in ordinary
of Richmond Gardens, lately converted into floating capital, as places
for aquatic entertainment and abodes, proved very useful for the refuge
of the sons of the Thames, to whom their father gave so cold a
reception.
10th. The area of Smithfield thrown open to the people as a Hortus
Siccus, being perfectly open to daylight, and covered with glass, after
the ſashion of the Crystal Palace.
15th. Subscriptions entered into by, the inhabitants of Regent,
Oxford, and Bond Streets, Piccadilly, and Holborn, to keep the tempe-
rature of these causeways, now glazed over, up to 60 degrees of
Fahrenheit.
20th. A remarkable instance of celerity in Public Works excited on
this day great popular attention; viz., the insertion of the fourth busso-
relievo on Nelson's Monument, and the fixing-up of the pedestal for
the first of the English lions.
25th. Repairs commenced on the pian' terreno or ground story of the
Houses of Lords and Commons, which discovered symptoms of
º decay. The superstructure not being yet complete, the
ormer had to be restored for the sake of unity of design, before its
finish, which the Architect ..". may take place in about ten years.
Feb. 1st. The colossal Model Lodging #. formerly called Hanover
Square, gave a Conversazione to the inmates of the rival Lodging House
(late Soho Square), and lectures, diversified by music, were given in the
grand Library attached to the establishment, occupying the ancient
ſoundation of Harewood House. Cobb EN, F. O'Connor, and ERNEST
Jones, were inaugurated to square, with Pitt,
5th. The first view of the Cathedral ever, offered to the citizens was
afforded, this day, by removing the hoarding which surrounded the
south side of Paternoster Row, the whole of which, together with the
north side of St. Paul's Churchyard, was demolished. Great consterna-
tion amongst the Dean and Chapter at being shown up too clearly.
March 15th. Brilliant entertainment al fresco, given on the ice § the
Corporation, at which Astley's Troupe added to the pomp. A bullock
was roasted whole by electricity, and the assembled company (including
the Patten Makers) danced the Pas de Pattineurs.
20th. The Last Man came up from the well-hole of BARBER BEAU-
MONT's pump in Piccadilly, looking very well, considering his long
immersion; and the first man (for four years) raised the pump handle,
which was succeeded by a jet that was considered pure, and of the
first water-considering the source and vicinage of the spring!
25th. An Aggregate Meeting of the Temperance Society was held this
day in the Crystal Palace, where 50,000 persons assembled; every one
was allowed a bouquet of exotics, and the name of PAxton never was
in better odour. The mob cheered at Apsley House, which opened its
eyes (the ferruginous blinds) the first time since the former and obsolete
Chartist movement. -
30th. The last stone of Buckingham Palace gateway was chiselled
this day with a wreath of roses, which was considered to be, if not the
perfection of architecture, at least the flower of perfection.
31st. A remarkably genial day; the town, full of rank, poured out its
trains of splendidly attired fashionables—their equipages having been
sent in advance by the railways. The new Park at #. with its
fountains, statues, and wonders of floriculture, never looked so
bewitching; the Grand Avenue for equestrians was thronged with
blooming àº; in Bloomer costume, and the Temples of the Muses
and Graces were filled with their, votaries, who now consider Hyd,
Park and the Regent's but smoky sluices, and a bore.

SIR. Cassian CREAM presents his compliments to Mr. Punº, and, as
a military man, begs to offer aremark which may be useful in preventing
much idle discussiºn on the part of civilians. There have been, lately,
several very absurd paragraphs done by the newspaper people respecting b
the large hair caps worn by Grenadiers, calculated to bring that part of
their uniform into ridicule and disuse. Perhaps, neither Mr. Punch,
nor an enlightened British public, are aware that the article in question
happens to be one of the most formidable means that our army employs
to strike terror in the ranks of an enemy. Not to take up too much of
Mr. Punch's º: (which, by-the-bye, SIR. C.C. may be pardoned for
observing, might be occupied more º than by the discussion
of questions concerning which Mr. P. can know nothing,) the fact is,
that the caps of the Grenadiers, upon the same ingenious principle that
Chinese shields are painted with hideous faces, were designed to
alarm, confuse, and paralyse the efforts of the foe; and, when Mr. Punch
ls told that, in close ##". each man of the gallant Grenadiers places
his cap on the point of his bayonet and shouts, B01 at the top of his
voice, the panic may be more easily imagined than described. SIR. C.
CREAM thinks that even a newspaper press must admit that it is not
such a very useless appendage, after all.

THE LAND PIRATES OF THE DOCKS.
THE merchants of London, especially those connected with the London
Dock Companies, are loudly complaining of the losses which they con;
tinually incur through repeated depredations, which may be styled
Custom-house robberies. These gross and monstrous thefts are perpe-
trated by means of a regularly organised system of plunder. A set of
fellows in the character of Custom-house officials, provided with authority
technically legal, make seizures of the merchants' goods under the
pretence that the proprietors have been guilty of some infringement of
the Revenue Laws. The sufferers are left to seek redress by a series of
actions in the law courts, which, by a preconcerted arrangement, are made
necessarily ruinous; the defendants, under the abused protection of the
Crown's name, being liable to no costs. A desperate attempt to obtain
justice was lately made by some of the victimised parties, who, how-
ever, recoiled from the prospect of the frightful expense they were
threatened with, in case they persisted in their suit. They sofar, how-
ever, succeeded in their object as to drive their plunderers to a com-
promise; thus virtually eliciting from them a confession of roguery,
which the knaves endeavoured to slur overin an officialletter, insinuating
a tissue of falsehoods. It is much to be regretted that this unprincipled
gang is encouraged and protected by persons of station, and, we suppose
we must say, character, connected with the Treasury. An individual of
the highest influence in Downing Street, who is well known to be
capable of exercising a control over these banditti if he pleases, was
lately applied to in the hope of inducing him to restrain their outrages:
but we are sorry to say that he expressed himself, in a measure, as the
apologist of the fellows, although promising that some inquiry should
e made as to their practices. It is proper to state that the chiefs of
these freebooters keep out of sight, and that their º are effected
by mere agents, who are mostly unaware, whether they are enforcing
the law or stealing. In these days, when highway robberies are almost
unknown, it is intolerable that acts of equally unjustifiable spoliation
should be openly committed in the Docks and warehouses of the City
of London. It is to no purpose that SIRJAMEs BRooke has destroyed
the pirates of the Indian Archipelago, if British commerce is still to be
§. to the ravages of the land corsairs that nestle in the Board of
ustoms.
LINES TO BROTHER JONATHAN.
OH, JonATHAN dear JonATHAN! a wretched world we see:
There’s scarce a freeman in it now, excepting you and me.
In soldier-ridden Christendom the sceptre is the sword;
The statutes of the nation from the cannon's mouth are roar'd.
Ordnance the subject multitude for ordinance obey;
The bullet and the bayonet debate at once allay:
The mouth is gagg'd, the Press is stopp'd, and we remain alone
With power our thoughts to utter, or to call our souls our own.
They hate us, Brother JonATHAN, those tyrants; they detest
The island sons of liberty, and freemen of the West;
It angers them that we survive their savage will to stem;
A sign of hope unto their slaves—a sign of fear to them.
Right gladly would they bind our tongues; with joy arrest our pens;
Immure our best and bravest men enchained in bestial dens;
Bend our stiffnecks to Priestcraft's yoke, and bow the heads we real
'Gainst craven superstition, to the dust in abject fear.
Stand with me, Brother JonATHAN, if ever need should be;
Still be it ours to show the world that nations can be free;
Not as almost each peºple in sad Europe now appears,
Ruled with a despot's iron rod, a race of mutineers.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAR1.
from Bath (if he were not there already, we should
PUNCH AND HIS CORRESPONDENTS.
Aving hoped to have begun
the new year in peace, we
are sorry to say that we
have been disappointed,
and that
“Our rest has been broken by
riddle and pun.”
We have serious thoughts
of indicting the postman as
a nuisance, for bringing us
the mass of correspondence
with which he invades the
sanctity of our hearth; for
we are obliged to throw the
eat mass of it behind
the fire.
In an unguarded mo-
ment, we gave admission,
a week or two ago, to a
conundrum from Liver-
pool, by a “young gal,”
whose friends write to in-
form us that she has never
been the same creature
since, and that having once
tasted the intoxicating
sweets of our page, she
thirsts for another sip of
the maddening luxury. They entreat, us to make room for one, more
question from the infatuated juvenile, whose senses...are evidently
whirling away in a melancholy reel, and who asks, “Why are persons
born deaf the most virtuous of beings?” The reply, written in a
hand betraying delirium tremens in an intense. degree, alleges, that
“those born deaf are the most virtuous, because º never errºd.” We
entreat the relatives of this “young gal” to call in DR. WINslow
while there is yet time. -
Some well-intentioned, but extremely irritating person, who writes
have told him to go
there), has more than “a little dashed our spirits” with the following:
“If Louis NAPOLEoN take liberty from the press, what will be the
product?—Dead letters!”
We are not generally of a speculative turn, but we would bet a
ha'porth of hardbake to an Archimedian screw of tobacco, that no
-
one will be able to see the wit of the above monstrosity. -
We are always unwilling to discourage industry, even when its re-
sults are rather deficient in value, and it is therefore with some
reluctance that we crush . insane hopes that may have arisen in the
deluded breast of the manufacturer of the following. It will be seen
that there is a vast mass of material employed, and, a quantity of
labour bestowed, on a matter which, when completed, excites rage
rather than satisfaction,
The irritating affair is provokingly called “A Con FoR CHRISTMAs.”
“Why is a young lady who walks under the mistletoe like an old lady
standing on the edge of the pavement at Charing Cross with three
arcelº, a basket, and an umbrella?–Because she is looking out for a
uss.'
It would be idle to ask what the author of the above atrocity is
looking out for, and it would perhaps be harsh to tell him what he
ºf: to expect.
t is a remarkable and melancholy fact, that age is no guarantee
against delinquency; for a gray-beard, writing from Chelsea--we hope
he is not in the § contaminating the veterans of that glorious
institution—asks, “What savoury dish his son in prison resembles?”
and the reply of the wretched malefactor is, “Jugg'd hare (heir).”
There is an evident familiarity with the slang of the criminal population
in this assault upon our better feelings; for “jugged” is 9 łº.
mous with “incarcerated” in the very vulgarest portions of the vulgar
ngue.
It was not to be expected that the correspondence, or rather the dif-
ference between Loºp John Russell and ADMIRAL NAPIER should be
allowed to pass, without its being made use of as an instrument of
torture to us, at the hands, of a cold unfeeling world; and we haye,
accordingly, been coolly assailed with the following, amidst some million
more, from the effects of which we are slowly, but by no means surely,
recovering:-
“What kind of dose is that which a celebrated Admiral has admini-
stered to the Premier, in the Times of Dec. 19th?—A-N-APIER-IENT'"
We cannot close the painful subject of our correspondence, without
entreating the public to send us no more jokes about THIERs, and tears,
and THIERs' parti, and quaſº, and tierce, and volun-teers, of which we
have several tons, now awaiting the leisure of our butterman. As we
get rid of our waste paper by weight, and as much of it contains extra-
ordinarily heavy jokes, there is, after all, some value in the dullest of our
correspondents. They are therefore at liberty to send as usual.
A WILTSHIRE CAROL.
BY A HAPPY PEASANTRY.
THE º of the English local ballads is, in most instances, lost in
the mist of antiquity. Circumstances, however, do still, occasionally,
evoke these effusions of the provincial mind. In many parts of Wilts-
where, we understand, the farmers have reduced their labourers' wages
to 5s, and 6s. a week, and in order to force them to accept these terms
certain squires and parsons have taken away the skim milk which had
previously been allowed them—the rural echoes resound with a plaintive
ditty, something to the following tenor:—
Six shillings a week, and no more milk;
And that’s the way poor folks they bilk, -
In their purple, fine linen, and broad cloth, and silk.
And 'twill be a happy New Year for we'
Our eyes they gets holler, our cheeks sinks in,
Our legs is mere *...; our sides is as thin;
To keep a pig so they would say 'twas a sin.
Six shillings, &c.
The 'squires and the parsons preaches content,
Whilst they puts us to this here pun-ish-ment,
With our wages screwed down to keep up tithes and rent.
Six shillings, &c.
Bomba in Raptures.
WHEN the news of BonAPARTE's coup d'état was brought to BQMBA,
it is said that, in a paroxysm of delight at the tidings, his volcanic
Majesty actually embraced the officer who bore them.
e should not like to be embraced by BoMBA. The embrace of
BoMBA is suggestive of the kiss of JUDAs. In BoMBA’s arms one
would almost feel as if in those of the }. image, which, in clasping
you to its bosom, pierced your own with daggers. -
It is a pity that BoMBA had a mere officer to fraternise with. How
happy he might have been in the hug of the Russian Bear !
The Member for Bodmin the greatest of Mathematicians.
In histories old, a fast knot to unloose,
Was what, we are told, had foiled many a goose;
Till Great Alexander excited men's wonder
By taking his sabre to cut it asunder.

Is always a problem that’s certain to floor'em.
That’s nothing!—but when a professor, in vain,
In squaring the circle, has puzzled his brain,_
Lo! W. found the secret, and made the world stare,
Who solves it by bringing a Globe to a Square.
The HEAT OF THE DAY.
SEveRAL of the “insurgents,” whose rising seems to have been
confined to their getting up at the usual hour on the morning of the
Second of December, are to be sent to Cayenne. Many of them think
themselves fortunate in ºf to go to Cayenne, instead of having
been unmercifully peppered on the Boulevards.

BANK-NoTEs are made, as we all know, of rags; but we never could
imagine hº fall lower in value than the materials they were
made of. d yet this is positively the case with the Austrian bank-
notes. The people will not have them at any price—not even at the

THE SUPPORTERS OF THE POPE.
(To M. LE COMTE DE MONTALEMBERT.)
“M. Le CoMTE,
“You, and M. DARRAs, and
the rest of your party, who believe
the Popedom to be the Lord Lieu-
tenancy of Heaven, and who there-
fore desire to see it co-extensive
with this planet, (if you admit the
earth to be a planet, and do not
believe it to be the centre of the
universe,) proclaim that Louis NA-
PoleoN has saved France. He has
saved his bacon for the present ;
whether he will ultimately save that
or anything else, remains to be seen.
“Your affection for the President
of the French Republic—or what-
ever, by the time this comes to hand,
he may call himself—has, you will
own, been earned by the bayonets
which maintain the Pope at Rome
and the bullets that have cleared
- the way for the Jesuits at Paris.
“Is it not a maxim of that confederacy which you are pleased to call ‘the Church,’ that
he who flanks the priesthood with artillery, covers a multitude of sins At least he covers
not a few sinners, some one might say—some heretic who ought to be roasted; a punishment
than which, as your organ, the Univers, says, “nothing is more matural:'—a tigerly growl,
this, from #. Popish organ.
. Your, Pope's %. is not of this world—and therefore his servants fight. This
is the right reading, is it not *, *Put up thy sword,” signifies “Charge bayonets?' -
." Why not preach this religion to the eye, M. le Comte? Ş. not fortify every pulpit
with a couple of howitzers—plant field-pieces between the candlesticks on each altar *, *.
“Such might have been the appointments of a church in which a solemn .*.*
was offered for a successful act of perjury. A fitting incense for such a sacrifice woul
have been the fumes of gunpowder. -
“And so your Church, militant is a Church that militates with lead and iron, and her
burning and shining lights are cartridges and rockets And the Propaganda of your
Gospel is a masked battery?
“You will still have §§. martyrs, but now they will be not yourselves, but those who
stand in your way. And these enemies annihilated or down-trodden, your clergy will possess
the mind of Young France in peace. Will they be content with the #". of
Young France P. Do not the friars of all Europe thirst for the conquest of Qld England?
Would they not—if they could—instigate a crusade for that holy, purpose?, The sword of
our truly militant Church exterminated the Albigenses. In dealing with us Anglican
eretics, also, your motto, perhaps, would be, “Killor Cure.”
“Having suggested a motto for you—a truer legend than any other you can boast of
accept, M. le Comte, the assurance of the distinguished consideration with which I am,
“One who keeps a sharp look-out upon you and your confederates,
“And may therefore subscribe himself your constant
*INSPECTOR.”
Our Adhesion to Mr. Bonaparte.
THE French have formally kissed the iron rod with which Louis NAPOLEON proposes
to rule them. They like the taste of it. Every nation to its liking. Nothing, then, remains
but for Mr. Punch, respecting the choice of an independent people, to give in his adhesion
to MR. BonAPARTE, as President of the French Republic—or, in more correct language, of the
French what dye call it?-duranteen placiº that is as long as his subjects, or constituents,
or whatever they may be styled, will stand him. Punch repeats that he gives in his adhesion
to Louis NApolºgos; and whilst fours Napoleon continues to merit Punch's notice, Punch
will certainly stick to him.
A NATION THAT CAN PAY, AND won’T PAY, should BE MADE TO PAY.
THE ;...": Government will not pay its debts. If it is insolvent, we recommend it
to gº, through the Insolvent Debtor's Court. In fact, from the shortness of its means, we
should say that the Capital of Portugal was in Portugal Street, and the Insolvent Debtor's
Court was placed there expressly out of compliment to its Government.
Something Like a Staff
THE “Reduced Staff” of the Commissioners of Sewers is £18,321 a-year. If this is the
Staff in its reduced state, what must it have been before it was cut down? It must have
been so tremendously long, that we wonder they ever got anyone to balance it.
THE LAw of MIGHT.-The retirement of LoRD PALMERston will, it is expected, #. rise
to proceedings nominally of a legal character. A mandamus will be issued by the different
Continental Courts, and in every one of them the rule will be made absolute.
New NAVAL ORDER.—It is said that a new Naval Order is about to be instituted,—namely
. 9. of Modesty. Of course SIR CHARLEs NAPIER insists upon being the very first
ecorated.

Our pace fell slack and slow,
Till we lay,
Stopped midway
On the W. Railway, O !
Hallo! what’s this—a station ?

nother's observation
Is, “Here we’re at a stand!”
“Well, yes,” is the reply,

The minutes slowly roll on,
And yet we don't proceed;

A full stop this, indeed!”
We heard the horrid pun,
The drear attempt at fun,
As we lay,
In dismay,
On the Western Railway, O!
Now danger's ugly spectres
on our fancy throng;
We blame the line's Directors
In language rather strong:
“Confound those stingy souls .
No doubt we’re out of coals,”
Some did say,
As we lay
On the Western Railway, O !
We knock, and stamp, and clatter,
Upon the carriage floor,
And asking what's the matter?
The guard and stoker bore;
Till both men closed their jaws,
And would assign no cause
At a stay,
On the Western Railway, O!
Collision wisely fearing,
Our seats we quit outright;
And piles of hedgesticks rearing,
To warm us, bonfires light.
And hampers some unpack,

If we lay
Till next day,
On the Western Railway, O !
Three mortal hours we waited,
In fidget and in stew,
Upon the line, belated;
he down mail nearly due !
Oh! what a smash there'll be,
Unless it stops! thought we,
Whilst we lay,
Pale as whey
On the Western Railway, O !
Our hearts almost despairing
At last of Christmas beef, .
Down with two engines bearing
The goods train brought relief.
Qurs their spare engine steers;
We start, with sundry cheers,
At her tail,
‘Fore the gale, .

WHY DID LORD PALMERSTON RESIGN ?
This is a question which seems to puzzle all the wisest heads among
the gossiping circles; and all that is known seems to prove nothing but
the utter ignorance of the best-informed classes of society. We have
employed our own correspondent, and we have sent out several of our
own eaves-droppers, who have been hanging about the neighbourh
of Downing Street day after day, without hearing anything, satisfactory
or otherwise. An indefatigable penny-a-liner whom we have set on to
the job, and who is to be paid “piece-work” for all the news he gets,
has written a letter to Lord PALMERSTON every day, to ask him
“point-blank” the cause of his having resigned; and the penny-a-liner
has even added, that “a dinner for a most, deserving person depends
upon the result.”. But notwithstanding all this, the Ex-Secretary for
Foreign Affairs takes no notice of the application.
We have had some idea of writing to the Sunday Times, Bell's Life, or
Family Herald—for those authorities are kind enough to answer every:
thing in the world once a week—but it "...I occurred to us, that if
we were to ask ourselves the question, instead of writing to anybody
else, we might save the postage-stamp. We accordingly have asked
ourselves the question—“Why LoRD PALMERston resigned?” and,
with our usual politeness, we sent ourselves an immediate answer, to
the effect—that his Lordship resigned, because he couldn't help it.
Newspaper Arithmetic.
ONE of our morning contemporaries, in a very fair article upon
Government nepotism, has the following rather puzzling passage :-
“Of fifteen Cabinet Ministers, nine are related by blood or by affinity; eight are
Members of the House of Lords; three are sons, or brothers, of Members of the House
of Lords; and the remaining four are allied by blood or marriage to Members of
the House of Lords."
Now, as twenty-four into fifteen will not go, so, out of fifteen, twenty-
four will not come, by any process that we are acquainted with." How
there can be four remaining, when twenty have already been disposed
of out of fifteen, is one of those nuts we are unable to crack.

RAILWAY MEETING IN CONSTANTINOPLE,
(From the Galata Gazette.)
NUMERous and respectable
Meeting was held, a
few days since, at the
“Spicy Turban’’ Cof.
fee-house, Street of the
Water-pots, Constan-
tinople. The meeting
was not called for any
particular purpose, but
there was a general im-
pression, among those
who attended, that the
is new Egyptian Railway
was to be the subject
of conversation, and
“if anything came of
it,” as the promoters of
the meeting cautiousl
worded the proposal,
“they would see what
happened next.” This
# programme, conceived
* in an eminently, na-
tional spirit, had been
published, orally, for some days, and so large was the attendance, that
the coffee-house keeper himself was actually obliged—with many male-
dictions on his misfortunes-to get up and assist his slaves in serving
sweetmeats and sherbet. This shows how incalculable is the influence
of the Railway, that mighty engine of intercourse, which—[Having
heard something of this kind before, we have ventured to compress

the ground for want of seconding, because the original mover seconded it
with his foot; but the party most interested did. (Shouts of Aftert-
olsun /–May it do you good!) - -
The meeting smoked for two hours (the silence having been broken
only by an uncivil wish, by one of the party, in reference to the tomb
of the father of a tobacconist who had sold him some exceptionable
tom-bok), after which— -
SLAPHADJEE BEY opened the business of the day, by remarking—
“Wallah Billah! ” (Sensation.)
After a pause of twenty minutes, the speaker resumed. Allah kerim,

new is now old. (Applause.) Everything must be as it must. You

whose words, he said, were like the trickling of treacle from the bung.
hole of a cask. Backallum, we shall see—the meeting should see; but
these Franks talked like dragons. He had himself gone the journey
which the Frank now proposed to go in his newfangled manner. He
had crossed the sea—accursed be the days and nights!—in a Frankish
vessel, at great cost, and his very soul had been turned round within
him, until even brandy (Sensation), he meant sherbet, had lost its
sweetness to his mouth. The land-journey had taken him weeks, and
he had seen the faces of *H. and now this STEPHEnson would

HowLof SKRoNGER (a barber) had heard much talk of these rail.
ways. So far as he could learn, they exactly resembled the Gehenna
of the Moslem, for you had flames and roaring sounds around you; the
iron line on which you went was narrow as that of Al Sirāt, and if you
got off it, you went, as an American patient had told him, to etarnal
smash. (Sensation, and cries of “Stafferillah /*—Heaven forbid/)
LARRUPI. Mush had been told that the Franks allowed their wives
to journey in this manner. This observation was the cause of con-
siderable delay in the business, as the allusion to the wives, instantly
reminded every gentleman present of some anecdote illustrative of the
unworthiness of women, and the various narrations (interrupted for a
shºrt time by the hour of prayer) occupied alarge part of the morning.
BoGAz KissaLERI said that he had spoken with the man who had
§. to the great Show, commanded by the King of England, in his new
alace of Diamonds. . That man had told him wonders, and he rather
believed he had heard lies, but they were pleasant as the jangling of the
bells of Paradise. Concerning these raiſways, they were the work of
magicians. If you, entered them, you were stripped of your goods
much money was taken of you, and 3. were forbidden, under dreadful
imprecations, to kindle your pipe. Thrust into a box, you sat on a seat
harder than the mether iſ..., and then a scream of a demon was

heard, and the box flew away of its own accord over the tops of
mountains, and into the deep bowels of the earth. At last it stopped
and you were pulled out by soldiery; and those on whom ALLAH smiled
in their birth, received back their goods, or, it might be, received the
goods of others (but of less value); but to receive anything was the lot
of few, the goods being the spoil of the magicians. Along, the road
stood fiends, with hands pointing the way in mockery, and these were
usually children of those who been scalded or roasted by the con-
trivances of the magicians—sons, in fact, of burnt fathers. Demons,
with brass armour, and with eyes of carbuncles, larger than those of
Solomon himself, rolled hither and thither on wheels, spitting white
smoke, and whistling, and—— -

PITY THE POOR BAILIFFS.
TALE of woe is not
exactly in Punch's
line; yet for once
in the way, per-
haps, our ers
will put up with
a narrative which
is as brief as it
is affecting.
The Hampshire
Independent re-
lates that,
“At Liverpool, a few
days ago, three she-
riffs' officers boarded
the steam-ship Baltic,
when on the point of
sailing for New York.
They stated that they
were in search of
= an ahsconding debtor,
l, and as CAPTAIN CoM-
stock refused to wait
till they found him,
they were carried off, notwithstanding all their entreaties to the contrary.”
Poor fellows! What must have been their suffering in being thus
severed from their wives and children! A bailiff must be more
sensitive than another man to the misery of such a separation, from
having, been so often a witness of its attendant pangs. Think of the
melancholy situation of three men of a calling ºft, contemptible
and odious in nautical eyes, friendless and helpless amongst a set of
derisive sailors! . Imagine the coarse jests which would probably be
made on their features and their persuasion, if both the former and the
latter-as is most likely the case—were Hebrew Unthinking tars
do not consider that the employment of a sheriff's officer is a necessary
one: they § as mere baseness the humility which is content to
accept it. , Children of Israel in the hands of the Philistines, may too
truthfully be considered to represent, the case of these unfortunates;
they were as the †. hawk that has imprisoned itself in the hen:
roost; or the owl caught in the sunshine, in the midst of a flock of
sparrows.

THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT.
THE GRAND DUKE of SAxE WEIMAR — (according to the corre-
spondent of the Daily News)—has just performed an act of princely
• condescension; he has given to the bride of the PRINCE OF SAxe-
WEIMAR, who a short while since married our DUKE of RichMonD's
daughter, the title of “Countess of Domberg.” And for this courtly
reason; the lady not being of princely blood “she could only be
married º or with the left hand,” and cannot—at least in
the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar—receive the title of Princess.
We may not in these columns enter upon the arguments of old
schoolmen, who have some of them contended that Eve was formed
from the right rib, and others from the left, of ADAM : no, we will not
pause upon this contest of dexter and sinister; neither will we attempt
to club in with the third party (peacemakers though they be) who have
suggested that the text might bear the more enlarged interpretation
embracing a little of either side. Nevertheless, we may be permitte
to suggest an extension of the morganatic or left-handed principle to
other social contracts save that of marriage. If adopted, it might be
of §§ convenience to tender consciences.
Why should not Kaiser, King, or President be allowed to take a
morganatic oath to a constitution, holding up his left hand, or with it
holding the Book?--So that, time and convenience serving, the oath
might cease to be binding.
We would also have a lower fine for morganatic offences. And
whereas it may now be charged a pound to deal a blow with the right
* assault should pass for half the money, if committed with
the left.
Again: if a man accept a bill with his sinister hand, he should only
be liable to pay 10s. in the pound; the penalty of the whole amount
** only reserved for the dexter fingers.
ſe might enlarge upon the theme, multiplying instances and illus:
trations. But we end with a brief suggestive query. Why should
matrimony be made a left-handed matter for German princes, and not
for the world in general? Have they one side better than the other?
Twelve ribs of common matter—twelve of silver, German silver? ... If
the anatomists and heralds will prove this, then they may be allowed to
º left-ribbed wives: bone of their bone, but not metal of their
Inetal.

HINTS FOR THE HORSE GUARDS.
TENDING TO THE REFORM AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE ARMY.
THE following hints towards the more effectual arming and equip-
ment of the British soldier will, it is hoped, not be lost on Hea
Quarters; if those quarters contain as much brain as they are commonly
presumed to be endowed with. -
In every engagement, superiority depends upon weight of man and
metal; it is therefore of more consequence, to load, the soldier than
the musket, though the latter should be rendered as heavy as possible:
accordingly, it might be made six pounds heavier than a fowling-piece,
instead of three; and the weight an infantry private marches under
should be increased from 60 lbs. to 1 cwt. -
The British soldier is surest to earn his laurels in fighting hand to
hand, and foot to foot. On this account it is desirable to encourage
him, to come as soon as possible to close quarters; . With that view,
so that he may be induced to depend little on his fire, our army
muskets are made much wider in the bore, in proportion to the size
of the bullet, than they would be, if they were intended to carry straight;
and hence, the range of the same piece, with the same charge, and the
same aim, varies by some fifty yards. The trigger, also, is made so
hard to pull, as to render the soldier unable to draw it with a steady
hand. K more efficient plan would be, to load, the musket , with
powder, only, and to return to the good old match-lock. Lead and
gun-smithery would thus be saved, whilst we should retain all the
real advantage of the English musket, which is simply to terrify the
enemy. Without intending any offence to a gallant nation, we may
say that the French troops,
at Waterloo, were, by the
firing, at least, of our men,
more frightened than hurt.
Firing with powder only
would require no skill;
and the "soldier would
therefore no longer need
to burn away yearly, in
practice, some 30 rounds
of cartridge: a quantity
great enough to cost
Powehrul £25 DRAGooN, EQUAL to 22 SToxE. ºl." small to
With regard to our Cavalry, a most important alteration is recom-
mended. ºLight Dragoon, facetiously so called, weighs, accoutre-
ments and all
rides a horse, of which the regu-
lation price is £25. The charge
of such a horse must correspond
to his price, and must be con-
siderably inferior, to the mo-
mentum with which the rider
would be borne against the
enemy on his own legs. It
is therefore respectfully pro-
posed, that, instead of the horse
carrying the man, the man
should carry the horse. Hereby
the cost, both of the animal
and of his keep, would be
materially lessened, as there
would be no necessity for his
eing alive; and, in fact, this
charger might be the sort of
.# that the late John REEVE
and his forces used to be
mounted on, in the once po-
pular burlesque of The Quad-
rupeds.
We hope this idea of a horse
will not be rejected because it
is considered a hobby.

Clerical Mrs. Bloomers.
SoME one—it does not much matter who-calls Puseyism
“THE BloomERIsM of The CHURCH ; ” for it is trying
(he says) to put upon the English Church precisely the
same ridiculous habits which É. is endeavouring
to put on the female dress; and as the Bloomer costume
borrows a little from the male form, and a little from the
female, so is the Puseyite religion made up of a mass (in
fact there is too much of the Mass) of Roman Catholic and
Protestant forms, till you can hardly tell which is which.
MEAN JEALOUSY,
ALL the Leaders in the French newspapers are suppressed.
This is mean jealousy on the part of Louis NAPOLEon. He
will only tolerate one Leader at a time, in France—and that
Leader must be, of course, himself!
To BE LET, on LEAse, (including the use of the fixture)
the Monument on which PATIENCE sits.
A SECRET FOR THE FRENCH PRESIDENT.
M. SALVERTE in his Sciences Occultes narrates a scientific anecdote
that may be of service to Louis NAPOLEoN, who is claimed by certain
parties of the Red Republic, as about to become, in due season, as red
as themselves. Any way, the President may find the story worthy of
his attention. There is peculiar significance in it, when considered in
combination with the sausages and champagne that, devoted to the
military stomach, found their way to the military heart.
Once upon a time, PROFEssoR BEYRuss, at the Court of the DUKE
of BRUNswick, had promised that his dress should become red, and that
during a repast. And this change, to the astonishment of the Prince
and the guests, took place. Now, SALVERTE tells us how the trick was
... . Pour lime-water upon the juice of beet-root, and a
colourless liquid is obtained; cloth, dipped in this liquid and quickly
dried, becomes red in a few hours by the current of the air alone. But
this effect is much accelerated, in a room where champagne, wine and
. ºvensº, charged with carbonic acid gas, are abundantly
supplied.
Punch respectfully, presents this story to the consideration of the
French President. We know what we are, says Ophelia, but we know
not what we may be: hence, the story may be useful.
TAKE CARE OF YOUR POCKETS.

We shouldn't like a book with this title much, for we are afraid that
if we once, got the Lawyer in our pocket, we never should be able to

PUTNEY NEW BRIDGE.

in the new bond of a new and elegant bridge. ...And we further under-
stand that the Bishop of London has, in the handsomest manner
offered to preside at the ceremony...of opening the bridge aforesaid
upon this most wise and Christian-like proviso;-namely, that double
toll, shall not (as at present, on the old and mercenary structure)
be levied on Sundays. The Bishop very properly asks (or might ask),
“Wherefore take a º on week days, and exact double on the
seventh? Is there not the worst Sabbath-breaking (namely, that, of
extortion) in two Sunday halfpence instead of the working-day one f"
The North-West Passage.
We are not usually very savage in our desires, but we really are

addendum—Hobson's understood.

declares that—

lady's smelling-bottle.’
“How very nasty' But what fol-
lows is worse:—
“‘Or are used by her to flavour blancmanges

shocked was.I at learning from our medi-
cal man that such was really the case,
for that essence of bitter almonds is
in fact, prussic acid, which is prepared
from the remains of all sorts of animals.
Dreadful as this idea is, however, it
falls short of that which comes next—stated in the coolest off-hand
way, with all the sang froid of a disagreeable philosopher.
“This economy of the chemistry of Art is only in imitation of what we observe in
the chemistry of Nature. Animals live, and die; their dead bodies, passing into putri-

organic-life; and it is these plants, actually consisting of a past generation of ancestors,
that form our present food.'

of chemistry, but row I see what a shocking science it is, I quite hate
it. It discloses such unpleasant secrets, that they had much better have
never been discovered; ignorance of such matters is truly bliss, and it is
folly, indeed, to be wise, on subjects of so ". a nature, a know-
ledge of which is calculated to entirely destroy one’s appetite—
U-u-u.ugh! I fear I cannot adequately spell the word to express my
feelings; but pray, Punch, excuse my orthography, and do me one
favour. I am going to make a strange requ'st for a lady; but do,
there's a dear soul, use all your influence to get the proper authorities,
whose business it is, to put in force the Intramural Interments Bill,
which I believe is a law for preventing burials in the midst of our
dwellings; and also the Acts of Parliament with regard to draining;
for really I should be glad to breathe as little of ‘a past generation of
ancestors,” and other ‘dead bodies,’ &c., as possible. Pray see to
this, and you will be a duck of a Punch, and I shall remain your ever

and a thick neck, dressed in a suit of very shiny velveteen, with sport-
ing buttons, a bird's-eye handkerchief knotted round his neck, white
stockings, and ankle-boots. He is quietly º a pipe, and con-
templating his family, biped and quadruped. MRs. &A. is
invisible. Several Masºns and "Missºs Chairer are disposed
about the room; some engaged in domestic duties towards the birds
and beasts; the youngest teaching some bulldog puppies to fly at each
other's throats. There are several dogs about the room, which, as
Mrs. BAKER enters with SPRIGGLEs, set up a furious barking.
Chalker. Down, bitch—'old your row, CRIBB-will yer now, some of
yer! (He distributes a liberal allowance ºf kicks, among the dogs, who
mitigate their bark into a growl. Two silent bull-dogs approach Mrs.
BAKER) Come back, BILLY! 'ere, TIDY!
[The bulldogs retire, dissappointed. CHALKER rises respectfully,
and lays aside his pipe, recognising SPRIGGLEs.
Spriggles. Oh! it's MRs. BAKER, BILL-our missus—as has lost a
favourite dog, and I thought you was likeliest to be able to find out for
her if he’s been took.
Mrs. Baker (eagerly). And I’m sure, my good man—Good gracious!
what’s that? (A tame ferret appears from under her petticoats.) Ugh!
Chalker (calmly). He won't ſº 'm; 'is mouth's sowed up.
[The young CHALKERs enjoy Mrs. BAKER's alarm.
Mrs. Baker. Thank you. I was only going to say, that I’m sure if
there’s any expense—Oh, dear me! (a fancy pigeon having settled itself
on MRs. BAKER's shoulders, begins to coo pleasantly.) Oh! there's
something on my shoulder.
Chalker (savagely to the young CHALKER, to whom is entrusted the
pigeon department). Now, JIM, you'll be a ketchin' somethin, if you lets
them birds out agin, mind yer'

his basket.

Mrs. Baker. He was a handsome dog—a spaniel.
Chalker (interrupting). I knows the dawg, 'm—arf-spannel, and the
rest cocker-lurcher, bull terrier, and a touch of the plum-pudding dog
(winking at SPRIggies). Well, he's quite a fancy dawg, missus, there's
no doubt of that. But when did you lose him?
Mrs. Baker. Last night, we think; at least he was there when I
went to bed, and we never heard him or saw him after,
Chalker (passing his hand over his chin, thoughtfully). Ah! Yes!—
that’ll be it; they’re werry sweet on 'em in France, now.
Mrs. Baker (puzzled). Eh?
Chalker. On them sort of dawg, 'm. That dawg's worth five pound
to CARRors Joe;—that’s the man as speckelates in 'em, Marm, aboard
the Oastend, or Antwerpun, or the Bulone;-five pound, if he's worth
a penny.

Chalker (in a business-like way), Why, you see, 'm, the beauty of

Mrs. Baker. That it certainly is, JAMEs. Good morning, MR.
Chalker. I’m really so agitated and so much obliged, if you find him.
[She makes her way to the door, followed by SPRIGGLEs, amid various
obstructions in the shape of bull-dogs, terriers, cages, hutches,
goung CHALKERs, &c., &c., &c. As they go out, SPRIGGLES
turns and catches CHALKER's eye. A wink of profound diplo.
matic significance is earchanged between them. The Scene closes.
A Pump-Handle for a Joke.
IN consequence of the tendency of some of the Government Steamers
to leakage, it has been º: that every vessel should be compelled
to carry out an additional pump. Perhaps, if each craft should be
ordered to take out a Lord of the Admiralty, it would amount to the
same thing. We are, however, fearful that the comparison does not
quite hold, for every pump is supposed to have something to do, with
water—a qualification which a Lord of the Admiralty is not always
required to possess.

KING OF NAPLEs are BoMBA—zine.
A CAUTION TO WORKMEN.
THE only Strike Workmen should ever be guilty of, is that recom-
mended to all Englishmen in the song of “Britons, Strike Home.”
OLD AND NEW BILLINGSGATE.
Who can doubt the influence of architecture on the feelings and
manners of a people? Fine buildings make refined citizens. . We will
not go to Athens in her glory for the profound truth of this fact; but
take much more modern instances of the elevating verity. The cabmen
on the Trafalgar Square stand have become pleasantly celebrated for
the suavity of their manners and the lowness of their fares. And
wherefore? Why, the refining beauty of the National Gallery has
imperceptibly ºn into their minds, and elevated their morals. The
soldiers who have done º standing ... at the base of the York
Column, Waterloo Place, shine conspicuously throughout the army, as
humanexamples of the most conscientious dealing; as SUCKLING sings,
“Owing ne'er a girl a kiss, nor e'er a knave a shilling.”
* The Germans have called architecture a “petrified religion.” Hence,
should we wonder when a Dean and Chapter, influenced by the devotion
enshrined in stone walls, consent to show their Cathedral gratis, fore-
going the time-dishonoured charge of !. However, we will
add but one more example to the list of architectural moral triumphs,
and that example shall be—Billingsgate! -
Our worthy contemporary, the Builder, has become agreeably en-
thusiastic on “the new Market buildings.” He also dwells with
pleasant pride upon the river wall of Haytor granite,” and other
glories of his noble craft, “suggesting motions of respectability, decency,
and order.” The frequenters of Billingsgate, says the Builder, “have,
or rather, had a language of their own: ” but the characteristic
coarseness has departed, refined away by the spirit of architecture.
We are fortunately prepared to bear witness to this truth, having, last
week, upon a visit º inquiry to the Market, overheard, an altercation
between two females; vendors of fish. We give the dialogue as
A SPECIMEN OF NEW BILLINGSGATE.
Mrs. Jones (who has been pushed by MRs. BRowN.) Well, I’m sure :
Against whom do you think you’re protruding P
Mrs. Brown. Against whom, mem? Enquire of my elbow, mem.
Mrs. Jones. None of your flowers of speech—you canine animal!
Mrs. Brown. Canine animall Come, that is good—you with a counte-
nance suggestive of cribbage.
Mrs. º: Cribbage! Well, if I’d the face of some people, I’d
only come out with the feline species—and not then when the moon
was lustrous.
Mrs. Brown. The moon, mem.' . The moon! Let me tell you the
moon has a man in it; and far as he is away, he'd turn his nose up at the
bare notion of some people, mem.
Mrs. Jones. To be sure. Didn't he once turn his nose into next week,
mem; and wasn't it at some person's fresh fish, mem?
Mrs. Brown. Fresh fish if you were not indefinitely below my notice,
I might observe that I–yes, mem, I—was never up before the Lord
MAYOR, for poisoning the Spectacle Makers' Company—every one of
whom was blind for a fortnight—with muscles, mem.
Mrs. Jones. Muscles! You said muscles, you aggravating female!
Mrs. Brown. Muscles And what is more, mem, muscles picked
from the copper stern of HER MAJESTY's convict ship Dreadnought,
every one of which had a penn'orth of metal in its inside, which, upon
the oath of a chemist, has made the Spectacle Makers green from that
day to this. There, mem' Poisoned muscles | What do you say to
that, mem?
Mrs. Jones. Say! I have no hesitation in saying, it is a scarlet
hallucination.
Mrs. Brown. If that is your opinion, mem, I shall, on the present
occasion, content myself with merely observing that—you're another.
But to return to muscles; I never fed oysters, mem, with hard pease,
and then sold 'em to a Jew as oysters with real pearls from Indy in their
stomachs.
Mrs. Jones. What I do, mem, I do above-board, without pretence; I
didn't get a medal from the Humane Society for skinning eels in their
sleep, mem -
Mrs. Brown. No, mem? Nor, since you oblige me to utter my
thoughts—
Mrs. Robinson (a friend of both parties) interferes. Now, my dear,
good creatures, why fall out? Life is short: 3hall we have a drop of
something to correspond? -
Mrs. Jones. I bear no animosity, and will toss MRs. BRowN for half-
a-pint of alcohol, flavoured with the berry of the juniper.
ºirs. Broºn. With all my heart. You cry. [Throws up a penny.
Mrs. Jones. Heads!
Mrs. Brown. My dear, it’s quite the reverse.
Mrs. Jones. So I see; and so I’ve lost. Where shall we go? To
the Grimalkin-and-Bagpipes?
Mrs. Robinson. No, my dear, they water and physician their alcohol.

FUNNY MARKET AND WITTY
INTELLIGENCE.
The immense amount of specie—or
wit of every species—in the coffers of
the Punch Office is still the subject of
general conversation; and though the
issues of the Punch paper still far ex-
ceed all former amounts, with a ten-
dency to increase, every demand con-
tinues to be honoured with a prompti-
tude calculated to add, if possible, to
the confidence felt by the public in the
resources at command. The weekly
publication, showing a constant aug-
mentation of the values, causes a con
tinual upward movement, and large
sums are cleared by those who have
speculated for a rise. A slight advance
occurred in the lighter kind of witti-
cisms, in consequence of the Govern-
ment joker having come into the

large amount, on account of articles
for a well-known evening paper. The

the auspices of benevolent fairies, and commissioned to hit wicked
people only. . Houses were riddled º musketry—bullets were poured
into knots of dozen passengers; and yet, upon the official return, we
find that “only ten innocent persons were killed !” “There: what
think you of that ?” cry certain journalists. “Only ten innocent
victims ?” Our answer is—we think the number shows the liberality
of the PRESIDENT. Seeing that he had the ordering of the return, “ten”
must be considered handsome. It might have been one; or—none.

FRENCH COCKS AND FRENCH EAGLES.
RINCE Louis NAPOLEoN has
added to his glories: he has
knocked the French Cock
off his perch, and reinstated
the French Eagle. The Cock
that was heard at Antwerp,
Isly, and, rejoicing the re-
ligious heart of Pio Nono,
crowed an historic cock-a-
doodle-doo in the Roman
Capitol—vice Roman Geese,
deceased—is now so much
vulgar poultry. In France,
the Cock has had his walk:
there is to be no more dung-

- : same Cock, in 1848, had
his head cut off—was, in
representative brass– “de-
capitated on a great num-
ber of shakoes.” Whereas,
“the French Eagle may
have been conquered, but
was never humiliated.”
Never? No; not even when
landed sea-sick at Boulogne,
and—taken captive—sentenced to feed on garbage at Boulogne slaughter-house. Louis
NAPOLEoN at Ham, and his half-plucked familiar at the Abattoir.
And now, Louis NApoleon, moulting for imperial feathers, disgraces the vulgar househºld
thing, to promote the bird of the empire. Cocks cease to crow, and totally disappear. The
French army that went to sleep, roosting upon one leg, wake at beat of drum so many
eagles! They are no longer to stretch the neck for bloodless, corn; are, not, tº follow CEREs,
the farmer's wife; but are to look about them for lambs and hares, and joyfully acknowledge
the shriek of BELLONA. -- -
It is manifest that Louis NAPOLEoN knows the human heart as it is wont to rub-a-dub
under the blue serge of the French soldier. The Imperial President knows the gratitude
that must flow upon him from the changed condition of every hero. Not a drummer but is
elevated; yesterday he was a mere bantam cock; to-day, he is an eaglet of the sun. He
scratched . dunghill; and now, from his eyry, he looks abroad upon a Land of Promise
—that is, a Land of Pillage. - -
But, after all, can the Emperor-President—or President-Emperor—award to France a living
eagle?...Is it the true thing? Can it, upon its own vitality, soar and bear the thunder! We
are i. in the suspicion conveyed in the query. For once upon, a time, there was a
subtle machinist—by name ºl. made a Wooden Eagle; and this bird, the
Chroniclers tell us, was so like unto the living thing, that it flew forth, making a certain
circuit, and at the happy moment, dropped a crown upon the head of MAXIMILIAN, then
passing through the City gates, in holiday triumph. - -
Now, we more than suspect that this very Eagle of the President–seemingly. in full
feather, and gazing upon the sun of France with the very brightest of glass eyes-is no other
than the old wooden bird, curiously preserved, to assert the sometime luck, of human
accidents. It is wonderful how old things re-appear when they are wanted. A few
nights since, Louis NApoleon went to the Opera, the performances further patronised by
the bayonets of the line. Eagles, there awaited him: eagles, preserved—we are assured
of the elevating truth—from the days of BuonAPARTE. Had Łouis NºroLeos required the
bees of Clovis, can there be any doubt of a supply of the living insect, in a direct line
buzzing down to 1852?
Therefore, we can only accept the Eagle given by the present ruler of France, to his
grateful country, as a ligneous bird—a thing ºfº, and wheels; a bit of capital mechanism
that may serve its turn or two; but with no sustaining life; nothing to keep it up. A dea
Eagle, even though in the clouds, and coming at last dumpishly down to earth, like
!. ºverty Eagle of the play-house, when the man in Der Freischütz fires the enchanted
u
eL.
Aſter all, the Cock is a more rational, a more pleasing emblem for a nation, than the
Quiline bird of slaughter. The Cock is, the trumpet of the morn; the herald of the
life-creating, world-delighting sun. The Cock is generous; for, until made selfish by old
age, he will, on the discovery of worm or grain, call his wives about him, show, the prize,
and strutting forth, magnanimously forego it; a fine lesson this for self-denying rulers.
Besides, to the French nation, the Cock should have the most cheering of attributes. Is
there not a Lion—a perfidious lion—on the British shore opposite? And is it not an old,
old truth-enshrined in many stories—that when the Cock crows, the Lion trembles?
We submit the question to the cabinet (when found) of Louis NAPOLEoN. Is not a
crowing cock better than a wooden eagle A living thing of the farm-yard of more account
than an imperial dummy?
BROTHER JONATHAN ON OUR
NATIONAL DEFENCES.
(From the Buffalo Stockdologer.)
THAT beef-eating old coon, John BULL, is like
to be in a fix. He had betterlook out for squalls.
He has had fair warning. SHAKESPEARE says
there’s a divinity that shapes our ends...That’s
how Nature made the tail of the rattlesnake.
He lets you know he's a-coming your way, the
rattlesnake does. He gives you notice to clear
off. If he bites you after that, it’s your own
fault. Just so with John Bull. If he's cotched
napping, he’ll have nobody to blame but his own
self."Nature is uniform. She hoists danger
signals wherever there’s danger. You may read
'em if you’ve a mind to attend to 'em, which
you id best have. Here's the French flag a-
flying at this moment with the BonapaRTE Eagle
upon it, larger than life. That’s a danger signal
to John BULL. It means the Empire over
again. It’s a sign that Lewis NAPOLEON
intends to play old Scratch da capo. Well,
what will John BULL do if he is wise? In the
first place, he will be civil; anyhow, you can fix
it, he will lose money by º: ... What next?
—always supposing he’s wise. Well, everybody
best knows #: own concerns. If he’s a goney,
what he’ll do is as plain as a speck of white on
a nigger. He'll continue to arm his troops with
muskets that shoot, any way, but, point blank.
He will persevere in mounting his dr Ins
upon old cab-horses. He will persist in building
ships that won't sail, and steamers that won't
act; in victualling them with meat in a state of
decomposition; in underpaying his sailors, and
doing everything that lies in his power to drive
*the best hands out of his navy. And he’ll
ake
fended in every spot likely to give an openin
to LEwis NApoleon, in case that possum shoul
ever, feel inclined to try a coup de France on the
British nation. He will believe such an outrage
impossible. He will let his self be talked over
% his easy friends, who persuade him not to
think of such a thing. Oh yes! he'll trust that
a loafer who only upset the constitution of his
own country, will stick at violating the law of
nations. He'll rely on Lewis NAPOLEoN's
honour, and his own good luck; he’ll shut his
eyes and stop his ears against every warning;
he’ll act like one of his own partridges, that puts
its head in a hole, and there stands, thinking
itself in safety, because it sees no peril, till pre-
sently down comes a poacher, and quietly puts a
pinch of salt on its tail.

RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT; OR, 1851 AND 1852,
BETWEEN the year on which the might is sinking
And that on which riseth the light of day,
Istand and mark the Hours, that, all unwinking,
From year to year their service shift alway:
Sad Hours, with drooping wings and tearful faces,
Sweet Hours, with rainbow plumes and laughing eyes:
Some, whose stern brows still show war's bloody traces;
Others with olive crown'd, in peaceful guise.
Like duteous servants their lord's eyes that close,
The Hours are gather'd round the dying Year,
To whom the last leap of Life's taper shows
The shadows flung by coming things more clear.
“Attendant Hours, liſt me up on my bed,
That I may speak the things I have to say,
Before I am borne hence, with muffled head,
To the great grave of the years pass'd away.
Before me lies my life; 'midst wrong and terror,
And force and fraud, out of it shines a light,
Held by the balmy hand of Peace, from error
A beacon to guide nations to the right.
And in the luminous orbit of that splendour
Britain sits, throned by Peace, serenely strong;
While all the nations unforced homage render,
And to the twain with ample offerings throng.
And all the sky is jubilant with voices
Of brotherhood and hope without alloy;
Science is quickened, Industry rejoices,
And Art's sweet eyes are radiant with joy.
This hush of calm 'mid the world's din of battle,
This space of sunshine on Earth's twilight stage,
This choral song, heard through Life's wail and brattle,
Fell in my life. Time writes it on my page.

I see the light of Peace quenched in her hand;
Britain still sits, but sits alone, not brooking
Companionship of them that round her stand.
Her brow, that still to me was calm and clear,
Is gnarled and knit; and in her stalwart hand,
(Which wont for me the olive crown to rear.)
Behold! undrawn as yet, a mighty brand.
So sits, she, º; º: but war not fearing;
While over-head looms a black thunder-cloud,
Out of whose bosom, to the startled hearing,
Come cannon-shot, and wail and war-cry loud.
She sees it creep from border unto border,
Sadly she marks the war within its womb;
But, trusting still in Free Speech, Law, and Order,
She sits in light, where all besides is gloom.”
OUR CLUB-MAN.
The Foozle Club, January 7.
Two o'clock, P.M.–It’s
all up. GRAHAM has
been sent for—is to
be made a peer; some
7 say BARON PHILIBEg;
// some, the EARL of
// CUMBERLAND. Title
no matter—but the
sending for is a fact
—a “great fact”—as
GENERAL Bolsover,
five minutes since,
with a blow upon
the mahogany, and a
purple countenance,
vociferated,
The REV. XAVIER
PolycARP-who has
just been presented to
the new church of St.
Dimity—has come in;
bland . and smiling.
Says with SIR JAMEs
- - in the Cabinet, we
shall really have religious freedom. Understands that Doctor Wise.
MAN has a banquet on the occasion.
2}, P. M.–Jack, RUMPUs, of the Inner Temple—but then he will joke
-brings news, that all the Ministers have resigned—forsworn their
families—changed their names—and intend to appeal to the country on
their anonymous merits.
GENERAI, Bolsover, very purple, says he doesn't believe a word
º: #. Strikes mahogany, and swears he should only like to catch 'em
al, 1U.
3 P. M.–THE Hon. HARRY Culpepper says—if he is not egregiously
mistaken-he has passed PALMERston on the Windsor Railway, going
down. Bolsoyer declares, “in that case, Europe will be in a blaze;
and France in London in a month.”
4 P.M.–SIR Boosky GotoBEd has the best information that New-
Astik has refused all offers–GRAHAM will accept nothing—even
GPAN VILLE begins to tremble—DERby intends to have a continual-fit
of gout-RichMoni) doesn't quite see his way;-and in conclusion, SIR
B. G. asks, with a despairing look, “what is to become of this devoted
country?” -
MR. HAMPDEN STUBBs (he got into the Foozles on the foundation, or
never could have been admitted,) begs to ask, SIR. B.G. if it is his
matured opinion that “the art of Government is any peculiar secret?
Is it, like certain quack medicines, made a mystery to gull the ignorant
and the unwary P As there is only one sun and one moon”—(continues
MR. HAMPDEN S., putting his right hand under his waistcoat, in the
approved platform fashion)—“one sun and one moon to lighten, comfort
and support the world—so also is there only one party, the Whigs—and
another party, the Tories—to govern it?”
(GENERAL Bolsover, in his loudest manner, gives it as his private
and confirmed conviction, that a man who would speak disrespectfully
of the sun and the moon—he meant the two parties—was a Radical
and, with his will, should be brought to a drum-head court-martial, and
shot, sir—shot!)
MA. HAMEDEN STUBBs (certainly not hearing the General) continues
to ask—" if there is no such element in the nation as the people?”
(The General satirically calls for his luncheon—“Cold mutton and
small-beer.”) - -
MR. H. S.–“No such element as the people? Are we not in a con-
dition of progress? And are the peºple—he meant the men of the
people—men like CoBDEN and BRIGHT”- - -
§. adding to his order, roars—“Two devilled kidneys!”)
MR. H. S.—“Are such men to bear the mark of exclusion? Are
they to be branded, like political CAINs?” -
The Rev. XAvieR PolycARP, taking his hat, observes, in a meek yet
firm manner, that “he has no wish to interfere with the º opl-
nions of any person—however violent and slightly rabid they may be ;
but he must protest against an indiscriminate application of that name
—MR. STUBBs must know the name to which he alludes—to any secular
affair soever.”
Well, then, MR. H. S. will ask—“Is England to be governed by a
couple of families? Are we to be a realm of castes? Are the men of
the people never to enter the Cabinet P Are Ministers to beget Minis-
ters for ever and ever? He paused for a reply.” . . -
In which case GENERAL Bolsover, jumping to his feet, and beating
the table, declares that MR. Fubbs or STUBBs shall have it. He (the
General) has been in India; he knows what castes are; and the thing
works well. A water-carrier begets a water-carrier—a tinker, a tinker
—a priest, a priest—a lawyer, a lawyer; and so on to the world's end.
And so it is with politics and Governments. Look at the Arab horses,
What makes 'em what they are P Why, exclusiveness. What would
become of 'em if you were to admit º cobs, galloways? It's
breed that does it. , Don't high politics, like high noses, run in
families P Wouldn't the blood of PITT–if you could get it—be the
blood for a Prime Minister? It’s all blood. t ELLIotts and GREYs
beget ELLIOTTs and GREYs for Downing Street—and, Coºdens, and
BRIGHTs, CoBDENs and BRIGHTs for cotton-mills. And that’s all he
has to say in the matter. º -
The argument of GENERAL Bolsover appears unanswerable, for it is
now five o'clock, and I’ve not heard another word about the Ministers.
The general opinion, however, is, that—but I must be silent for the
present, and merely -
Remain, Mr. Punch, -
YoUR CLUB-MAN.
(Private and Confidential), SIR Hº" M***", has just seen one of
the Ma’s of Ho"r; and tells me that a certain Illustrious Lady has not
been in bed these three nights; but has sat up (with six wax-candles)
watching the interests of our devoted country. I say nothing: but this
I must say—Wiral Regina /
QUOD.
(According to “Gent's Grammar.”)
Quod is a noun substantive, meaning a Prison.—As, for example,
the Queen's Bench is a Quod. The different cases of it—and they are
generally very hard ones—are gone through in the º manner:
though, if a person is wise, he will do much better to decline Quod
altogether.—
Nominative. Quod A Prison.
Genitive. Of, or belonging to, Quod . Six Months' Imprisonment.
Dative. To Quod . - - . . Having given a Bill for a friend.
Accusative. Quod . - . “Oh what a Fool I've been.”
Wocative. O Quod . - - . ... Owe £100, or more, as the case may be.
Ablative. Generally wanting (money).
There is no plural to Quod, as a person cannot be in two, ðr ; :
more Quods at the same time; and it is supposed that when Quod
been through once, nobody would be so foolish as to wish to go through
it again.
It is not known what is the origin of Quod, but it is strongly believed
that idleness lies at the root of it.
º
Our Naval Progress.
THE Admiralty for ever! The other day, according to the Times,
the MEGAERA steamer -
“Put into Plymouth in a thoroughly disabled state, unable to proceed with the 1st
battalion of the Rifle Brigade to the Cape of Good Hope.”
No doubt the Riflemen put back again as (see Lempriere) they took
ship—in a FURY.
Food for Foreign Powder.
THE British troops are all picked men; but since, they now-a-days
neither know how to ride nor fire, or, if they do, have horses that won’t
go and muskets that won't carry straight, the circumstance in question
will not appear until they get into action and are picked—off by the
enemy.
Rather Equivocal.
A MoRNING Paper, in an article on the Paris Exchange, says–
“On the Bourse, at the opening, a rumour had been artfully got up that the President
had been fired at, and with such success as to have caused a fall.”
Of which P President or prices?

THE GREAT CAB NUISANCE.
WE have heard something of an Economic Cab Company with civil drivers
and clean vehicles, but if they ever, made their appearance, they were clean gone
again before we became aware of their presence in the streets. To judge from
the existing, state of cab accommodation, we should say that a combination or
i. had been formed in accordance with a prospectus something like the
ollowing:—
METROPOLITAN MonoPolIST CAB company,
For Supplying the Public with dirty and iºnodious Cabs at about eighteen-pence
a mate.
The object of this association is to force upon the public a bad and dear, as
well as dangerous vehicle of conveyance, and to promulgate extortion by means
of insult, in pursuance of the system at present only partially carried out.
The ſare of the company's cabs will be as much as can be obtained per half.
mile. Men of determined character only will be employed, and, by a system of
mutual accommodation, the drivers will be expected to exchange their badges
with each other whenever they meet; so that the vexatious system of summon-
ing, on the part of the public, will be baffled, and eventually got rid of. , No
one will be received into the Company's service as a driver, unless he has been
fined at least three times; and members of the prize-ring will, in all cases, be
preferred. Though the profits on the mere fares may be calculated at about
one hundred and fifty #. cent, it is, hoped that, by a judicious working of
cracked, or broken windows, in the vehicles, a still further advantage may be
obtained at the expense of the public, in the way of compensation for damage—
and thus an old cab may be made to purchase itself over and over again. The
projectors intend starting immediately with as many cabs as they can pickup, and
the number will be increased to any extent that the public patience will ...

Quack! Quack! Quack!
The two parties in France—who are, the one for a King, and the other for a
Commonwealth—are easily distinguished by the names of Monarchists and Re-

THE APPROACHING SESSION.
UR readers are informed that
Punch has in preparation a Bill
for the prevention of Cruelty
to Quotations, which he means
to bring in at an early period.
The well-known tribe of quo-
tations from the Latin Gram-
mar and a few other sources
have now suffered so long and
so much, that advantage ought
to be taken of a new session
to come to some understanding
respecting their better treat-
ment. hat can be more
necessary than to take some
steps about the following?
- irst of all, there is our very
l, old friend, Hinc ille lachrymae.
Let honourable members make
up their minds at once to let
him alone. Nobody sheds tears
on public occasions; why must
we persist in this stupid and
mendacious old formula?
Again, let us strongly sup-
ress our ancient acquaintance, Timeo Danaos, and lay him up in
onourable retirement. You don’t fear the Greeks-on the contrary,
you dun them with line-of-battle ships; and honourable members oppo-
site are not Greeks, if you did. - - -
Human nature can *. allude with patience to Rusticus expectat.
The treatment of him is too bad; it is shameful. You are called on by
every feeling of decency to refrain from meddling with him, for one
tession at least.
Quis tulerit GRAccHos, &c., is infamously pulled about, also.
Remember that the use of it is a libel on the GRACCHI, to begin with;
i. that there are no GRAccHI, either “opposite,” or anywhere, within
earing. -
It is pleasant to reflect that Dulce et decorum has enjoyed a tolerable
immunity of late. - - - -
Parcere subjectis, &c., has the highest claims on your kind consideration.
Don't drag him in, but act on the meaning of him, and spare your
audience. - - -
No good man will wantonly offend Et tu, BRUTE, in his grey old age,
we feel sure. -
As for Quicquid delirant reges, &c., we foresee that in the present, re-
actionary state of Europe, he is in great danger. We throw ourselves
on your consideration.
Pallida Mors was once very much persecuted. . As for Tempora mu-
tantur, we are afraid that all the º: of religion, and all the consi-
derations of philosophy, are unable to protect him /
We hope that public indignation awaits the man who shall next dare
to bring Wideo meliora probogue on the tapis.
We have no objection to a moderate use of the services of that sturdy
old hack, Requiescat in pace, for he has a grave and hatchment-like
sound, which tends to inspire decorous feelings.
But, with regard to the above-mentioned old hacks, , we implore
public compassion for them, and trust that our Bill will be heartily sup-
ported.
THE ADMIRALTY REWISITED.

Jan. 12, 1852.--To the Earth, and so to the Admiralty, to see how
they do Things there, now that, with Steam, and Mechanics and
Chymistry, and the Parliament and Government altogether so much
reformed, such fº Improvements I hear have been made since my
Time; but good Lack! to see what a State their Affairs are in ; and
very little Alteration, if any, for the better in a single_Matter.; and in
many much worse, and altogether all at Sixes and Sevens in horrid
Confusion, mighty shameful., The Megaera, setting out with Troops
for the Cape War, but obliged to put back again, and it is thought that
if she had gone to Sea she had foundered and lost all Hands, besides
Stores and Ammunition, and SIR CHARLEs NAPIER do say she could
neither carry her Engines or Armament, and the Wulcan as bad, and
also the Sidon, that after a thorough Refit at Portsmouth, and two
Years in Port, did break both her Condensers, and so down, on her
Voyage to Cork. In the Dock Yards continual pulling, to, Pieces, and
putting together again, especially of Steamers, through the Builders
and Engine-Makers working apart, without ever so much as once con-
ferring one with the other, which do seem a great Folly, and incredible,
almost. But worst of all, the dreadful Conduct of the Wictualling
Office, and to think of the Hubbub there had been in the House and
the Country when I had the Office about such a scandalous Business,
and thank Heaven we were chargeable with Nothing a thousandth
Part so bad! At Gosport Wictualling Yard 6000 of the Canisters of
Preserved Meat for the Navy, in Store, discovered to be good-for-
nothing, and worse, being all putrid, more or less, and not only that,
but many, besides, filled with Parts of the Animal unfit for Food, and
all Manner of Offal and *g. too nasty to mention. The Discovery,
as I learn, made through the Stench of the Provisions, which, was so
noisome it alarmed the whole Neighbourhood, and then at last the
Board did order a Search, and so the Murder, for it is little better,
out. But to think of such Willany and Roguery going on, as it did,
ever since 1848-9, and Complaints made from the very first in vain
and that is how they do the Ş. Service And then to think o
Ships on foreign Stations, or Voyages of Discovery, carrying such Stuff
for Food, and, in Extremity relying upon it perhaps, do make my
Heart sick. The condemned Provisions ordered to cast into the
Sea, and taken out to Spithead, and so sunk, and the Sailors do say have
killed great Numbers of Fishes. To Gosport, and did see and smell
some of the Meats called “GoLDNER's Preserves,” which may be
smelled a great way off, and do believe that if I had been a Mortal the
Stench would have poisoned me. Back to the Fields, pleased with
myself to compare the Office in my Time with what it have come to
now : but sorry for the poor Sailors, and vexed at Heart to think how
SIR. W. BATTEN and PEN, will triumph and hug themselves because
their Successors are as indifferent and careless as themselves, though
indeed not such Rogues. , I do expect W. CovenTRY, will be mighty
grieved when he come to know what a Plight the Admiralty Business is
in, and especially of this abominable Job of the Preserved Meats. And
ood Lack! to think of France in a Fever of Disquiet, with more than

34 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DESCRIPTION OF NIMROUD;
By One who paid his Shilling to go there.
HE Wiew of Nimroud—
which, after a lapse of
nearly twenty-five cen-
turies, MR. BURFoRD
has kindly presented to
the world again in
Leicester Square—may
be compared to an his-
torical potato-field, for
it is full of diggings,
and diggings into the
Past, morevaluablethan
any gold ones which
º, have yet been discovered
in California or Aus-
A tralia. It is not every
day that a city, which
has been buried up-
wards of 2400 years in
the earth, is turned up
with the spade of an antiquarian. The “Barrow” (to make use of the
technical term) that throws out so valuable a prize is richer than any
gold mine. To test its real value, it, must be shaken and sifted in
holes a cradle than the Cradle of Civilisation itself-that very cradle
in which Nineveh, in its infancy, was rocked—but we are afraid that
that cradle was destroyed long ago, when the Popes first attempted to
rock the world asleep in it. -
Talking of the Popes, one would imagine that Nimroud had been
cº; put under by a Papal Aggression, as it was intended, a short
time ago, that England should have been—only it wasn’t. All the
temples are defended by enormous Bulls with human heads (crowns on
the top of them, not unlike the tiara) and wings like those of Zamiel.
Qur temples were to have been barricaded in a similar ſashion; but the
Papal Bulls, if they had any wings, made very good use of them by
flying out of the country again as quick as they could.
The history of Nimroud was written, it seems, on the walls of the
City. It is lucky that the History of England is not written in the
same way, for it would soon be recommended to “TRY WARREN’s;”
or else completely smothered in one of the sheets of JULLIEN's
tremendous posters!
These walls were mostly composed of large slabs of alabaster, each
ten or twelve feet in height; and on these were depicted battles,
hunts, murders, picnics, and other manners and customs of the ancient
Nimrods. These drawings were not only “plain,” but “coloured’”
also, in the most gorgeous colours. In this they only resembled the
Nimrods of the present day, who love to compete as to who shall most
distinguish himself with “the Brush.”
There is another peculiarity about the houses of Nimroud. They
have no windows. e are afraid, from this circumstance, that poor
Nimroud laboured, as our English cities lately did, under a very heavy
window-tax. This must have been all the more burdensome on the
Assyrian inhabitants, as from the fact of their houses having no doors
either, the Tax-gatherer could have walked in at any time.
We cannot exactly say whether the view of Nimroud is like or not,
for we have never been there; but it looks like. ...At all events, it is ex:
tremely like to be popular. It is animated with Oriental groups, all
alive with the brightest colours, that seem planted about the fields like
rich flower-beds; and it has, besides, a number of bright tents, which
remind one strongly of the Chiswick Gardens on a Horticultural Fête
day; but there the resemblance begins and ends—for there are no
prismatic parasols, no lovely bonnets, no enormous gooseberries, to
embellish the beautiful scene ! -
But there is one great anomaly in MR. BURFORD's representation,
clever as it is, which we cannot help noticing. Every charity boy
knows that Nimroud was under ground, not above it. Now, MR. BUR.
FoRD's view is somewhere up in the attics, which gives one but a distant
notion of an excavation. A painter's imagination is allowed, it is true,
to take a high flight; but six flights are rather too many, we main-
tain, for the correct representation of a Digging !
However, we may be too fastidious. It is well known that the chase
was a favourite pursuit of Nimrod's. So, perhaps, this tremendous
chase up stairs was artistically thrown in as a little joke, by way of
forerunner to the Panorama—only, of the two, we certainly prefer the
Panorama. l
A Brief Leader on the Preserved Meat of the Navy.
THE proverb, that “what is one man's meat is another man's
poison,” has been remarkably verified in the case of our contractors
and our seamen. It is said that the fault lies in the nature of the metal
of which the cases were made, Very probably. Most of the corruption
in this world is produced by the Tin in it !—The Weekly Obfuscator.
THE PRACTICAL COOKERY-BOOK.
---
THE ST EAE.
AIR.—“The Sea.”
OF Steak—of Steak—of prime Rump Steak-
A slice of half-inch thickness take
Without a blemish, soft and sound;
In weight a little more than a pound.
Who if cook a Steak—who'd cook a Steak-
Must a fire clear proceed to make:
With the red above and the red below,
In one delicious genial glow.
If a coal should come, a blaze to make,
Have patience 1 You mustn't put on your Steak.
First rub—yes, rub, with suet fat,
The gridiron's bars, then on it flat
Impose the meat; and the fire soon
Will make it sing a delicious tune.
And when 'tis brown'd by the genial glow,
Just turn the upper side below.
Both sides with brown being cover'd o'er,
For the moment you broil your Steak no more,
But on a hot dish let it rest,
And add of butter a slice of the best;
In a minute or two the pepper-box take,
And with it gently dredge your Steak.
When seasoned quite, upon the fire
Some further time it will require;
And over and over be sure to turn
Your Steak till done—nor let it burn;
For nothing drives me half so wild
As a nice Rump Steak in the cooking º
I’ve lived in pleasure mixed with grief,
On fish and fowl, and mutton and beef;
With plenty of cash, and power to range,
But my Steak I never wished to change:
For a Steak was always a treat to me,
At breakfast, luncheon, dinner, or tea.
ROASTED SUCRING-PIG.
AIR.—“Scots wha hae,”
Cooks who’d roast a Sucking-pig,
Purchase one not over big ;
Coarse ones are not worth a fig;
So a young one buy.
See that it is scalded well,
(That is done by those who sell);
Therefore, on that point to dwell,
Were absurdity"
Sage and bread, mix just enough,
Salt and pepper quantum ºff,
And the Pig's interior stuff,
With the whole combined.
To a fire that’s rather high,
Lay it till completely dry;
Then to every part apply .
Cloth, with butter lined.
Dredge with flour o'er and o'er,
Till the Pig will hold no more;
Then do nothing else before
'Tis for serving fit.
Then scrape off the flour with care;
Then a butter'd cloth prepare;
Rub it well; then cut—not tear—
Off the head of it.
Then take out and mix the brains
With the gravy it contains;
While it on the spit remains,
Cut the Pig in two.
Chop the sage, and chop the bread,
Fine as very finest shred;
O'er it melted butter spread—
Stinginess won't do.
When it in the dish appears,
Garnish with the jaws and ears;
And when dinner hour nears,
Ready let it be.
Who can offer such a dish,
May dispense with fowl and fish;
And if he a guest should wish,
Let him send for me!

GRIMALDI v. BREADALBANE.
Of all our Government ships there are none worse managed than
the Censor-ship (and this, by the way, is no light assertion, if we are to
include the Megaera in our list). Almost daily there arises, new proof
of CoMMANDER BREADALBANE's unfitness for his post. Almost daily
we see, fresh reason to fear that his will form no exception to the
general rule of inefficiency observed in our governmental appoint-
ments. Not content with ever steering against the tide of popular
opinion, he seems continually on the look-out for some remote rock or
other for his unlucky “Ship” to split upon. º if his Lordship
would deign to accept a “bit of our mind,” we wo dadvise him in.
stantly totake a few lessons instage-seamanship from MR. T. P. Cooke,
or some other º: professor of the art. A man so little master
of his craft is real§ a disgrace to the service.
We are indebted to the Daily News for an account of the latest
theatrical piece—of work his Lordship has condescended to play the
foolin. e “boards” last honoured with his tread were those of the
Theatre Loyal, Marylebone. A scene in the pantomime of Sir John
Barleycorn, it appears, was the magnet that attracted the censorial metal:
a scene representing “The Drama at Home,” in Windsor Castle,
and one #. Shakspeaks discovered, sitting (et sit perpetua /
say we) at the feet of Royalty, at once the entertainer and the guest;-
a scene, be it added, perfectly inoffensive in ordinary eyes, and nightly
ap landed by the thunder of ordinary voices.
ut the eye of BREADALBANE, by some peculiar process of its own, of
which it is hoped no one will disturb the patent, at once detected dis-
respect, disloyalty-nay, peradventure, even High Treason itself, fur-
tively lurking behind that scene—all innocent as it seemed. And the
voice of BREADALBANE was not as the Worl’opuli: for the Breadalbanian
wrath was roused; and, lo! on a sudden—snip ! went the Breadalbanian
scissors ! - - - - - + -
That we should forthwith beflooded with a Niagara of correspondence
on the point, was a perfectly obvious and expected sequitur. From the
proudly pre-eminent position we have assumed as the leading organ
of the day in literary, political, social and general matters, we were,
of course, naturally prepared for it. And we assure our correspondents,
whose º: is Legion, that we most º regret our inability
to delight the universe with their very able and pertinent remarks.
“The present crowded state of our columns” (to use a favourite edito-
rialism) is at once our pride and our excuse.
One exception, however, we must make, in favour of a communication
which reached us yesterday, through the Dead Letter Office. We
were at first somewhat puzzled by the post-mark; but patience and an
gº at length enabled, us to decipher, singly, the letters
S.H.A.D.E.S n cracking the seal, we read as follows:-
“DEAR PUNCH, “Elysian Fields, just after Cock-crow.
“Anent this Censor—or rather, this In:censer of yours, for
your dramatic danders seem to be terribly ‘riz’ about him—ELLAR

his Lordship’s “kyind indulgence” in permitting them. After this

OUR BAROMETER OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
As the doctor ascertains the health of the patient by the pulse, so we
are ſº in our estimate of the health of the public by consulting its
hand, as shown in our correspondence; and we regret to say that our
report for the present week is not satisfactory.
The malady most prevalent during the last few days has been the
Conundrum mania, which has broken out in numerous places; and some
: º cases are so peculiar, that we cannot refrain from giving the par-
lculars.
In the district of Sleepy Hollow, A. S. L. has laboured under the
following:—
“Why are housemaids and gardeners sometimes idiots?–Because
they mop and mow.”
This is a very shocking case, but our district joker tells us, that the
afflicted person lives immediately over a comic-song shop, to which fact
his present condition must no doubt be attributed.
Another 'sad case of Conundro-mania has been brought under our
notice in quite another quarter; but we have ascertained that the
sufferer belongs to a family, many of whose members have been victims
to the same distressing malady. A great uncle lost a situation in a
commercial house, during the last century, by a propensity for punning;
and there can be little hope for the prospects of the perpetrator of the
following:—
"At what time were salt provisions first introduced into the navy
—When Noah took HAM into the ark.”
It would seem from the returns presented at our office, that there
were, during the last week, 1196 cases. of would-be witticism, and
which, allowing for the increase of population, is about 40 more than the
weekly average of the last five years. e are happy to denote a dimi-
mution of those cases, in which the complaint is accompanied by those
derangements of the organic Fº of orthography and grammar,
which were so numerous, untiſ within the last two or three years. It
is now very rarely that we have to notice an instance in which the
painful operation of italicising is rendered necessary.

which is justly due to the Admiralty for the existing state of naval architecture.
It may, however, beargued, with some show of reason, that a thorough improvement in the construction

as a general principle, that the very best test of the width of an

Here is a chance for the “philanthropic gentlemen.”-and ladies-to

DR. G– is a quack. What right have they to call him, so?. Have
they ever tested the powers of his “miraculous recipe”? Was not
GAiLLEo scouted and persecuted, from prejudice, without investigation?
Ditto Columbus? &c., &c. If infinitesimal globules are not too diffi-
cult for their deglutition, why should they refuse to swallow G–’s
pills—aye, by forties at a dose?, DR. G-'s pretensions inay be
inconsistent with Homoeopathy. But then, Homoeopathy is inconsistent
with Pººl. pathological, therapeutical, and pharmaceutical
facts. If Punch is wrong in stating this, the nobility, gentry, and
clergy above alluded to, do not know that he is not right. They have
never studied the laws of health and disease. . What do those duchesses
and other persons of quality of either gender know about the science of
medicine? Yet they think no geese of themselves for forming an
opinion on that subject, into which they have not ºl. in opposition
to the judgment of those who have made its study the business of their
lives. Personal recovery, after recourse to an alleged remedy, without
reference to the question of post hoc or propter hoc, is sufficient for them.
Then, why not try G–’s pills? They will not take upon themselves
more decidedly than they do at present to contradict the Colleges of
both Physicians and Surgeons; both of which bodies, by jºi.
Homzopathy, they virtuall declare themselves to regard as either
blockheads or impostors. By all means, then, let them do, the same
justice to DR. G- that they do to DR. GloBULEs, and that the
scientific and enlightened EARL of HollowAY did to PROFESSOR
ALDBOROUGH.
THE HAUNTED AREA OF LAMBETH.
(See a recent Police Report in the “Morning Post.")
'Twas past the dead hour of the night;
Through clouds uprear'd in fleecy piles
The stars shone out; the moon was bright:
The cats were on the tiles!
The moonbeam kiss'd the crystal dome,
And º: green lustre faintly threw
Upon the beasts that 'neath it roam,
Caged in the Surrey Zoo.j
And o'er a roof the high moon rode
That rose in Penton Place, hard by;
And slumberless in that abode
A Housekeeper did lie.
He could not sleep; but if he could
Have done so, he would not have slept.
He watched—and there was reason good
Why he this vigil kept.
Strange noises had been heard of late
Below his casement, and about
This hour; and he, at any rate,
Would find the mystery out.
The noise had wrought him little care,
Used to the neighbouring lions' roar;
But emptied was his safe, whene'er
'Twas heard the night beforei
moeopathists at large; and who
And, hark! again he hears the sound !
And quick as the electric Post
He skips below with silent bound,
In time to see the ghost!
A fº figure met his view;
It had a blazing saucer eye,
A glare of horrid light that threw
1 on a rabbit-pie!
And there, that spectre in the cape
Had come, as wont, no doubt, to sup;
And now, in a Policeman's shape,
His pie was eating up!
His step the hungry phantom scares;
It started guiltily, and, lo!
Straight vanish’d up the area stairs,
As fast as it could go!
The features of it'scaped his sight—
So quick it flew; nor could he gain
The number of the gobbling sprite,
To summon it again.
Advice of ELLIOTT, Lambeth's beak,
He craves in this mysterious case,
Who bids him the Policeman seek
On beat in Penton Place.
But trow ye, would that officer
The foul impeachment ever own,
The victuals of the Housekeeper
Even were he wont to bone?
Think, ere that Crusher you traduce,
His garb a burglar might belie;
His form, º the very Deuce
Assumed, to prig the pie.

“NAPOLEON'S STAFF.”
ALL the accounts of the French President are full of allusions to
“NAPOLEON's Staff.”
On the 10th of April, 1848, the “NAPOLEON's Staff” was a con-
stable's Staff—which harmless weapon, Louis NAPOLEON, sworn in
(the only public oath he ever kept) as a Special Constable, flourished on
the side of Order.
On December the 3rd, 1851, the “NAPOLEON's Staff” was enlisted
on the side of cruelty and, iawless oppression, and was changed from an
innocent Staff of wood into a murderous one of steel—a Staff of
Bayonets!
Of the two Staffs we prefer the “NAPOLEoN's Staff.” of 1848.
There is no blood upon it !

ToM Bowl ING,
* Query, Can MR. Bowlixg mean Moldavia?
MR. JOHN
BULL LOOKS UP HIS OLD MILITIA
REGIMENTALS.
ORDER OF THE LATCH-KEY.
E would institute a
new Order—THE
ORDER of THE
LATCH-KEY.
Hitherto, Orders
have been of too
limited an order.
They have been
conferred on per-
sons distinguished
generally in war-
fare. They are all refined
more or less with blood,
claiming in that respect a
sweet affinity with sugar.
Lately, a few Orders have
been given to literary merit;
but these shine very faintly,
and at long distances, like
the lamp-posts at Herne
ay.
But there are other he-
roes, surely, than military
and naval ones?, The Army
and Navy Clubs cannot,
possibly, monopolise all the
virtues in the world? Are
- - there not household virtues
that claim honourable distinction just as much as those displayed on a battle-field P. Are
there not battles fought on the hearth-rug fully as glorious as those of Waterloo and Trafalgar?
Yet these pass disgracefully unrecorded ! they are not allowed to shine even with the smallest
twinkle of a Star!
It is for this purpose we would institute The ORDER OF THE LATCH-KEY. It should be
founded expressly for, the encouragement and reward of social heroes and martyrs. Every
one who had fought the noble battle of domestic happiness should be entitled to claim it.
Every, husband who had bled freely at home should receive healing consolation for his
wounds, by being presented publicly with the “L.Atch-KEY.” - - -
We have purposely chosen the title of the “LATCH-KEY;” and we think it a very º
one, because, as the Latch-key is the proudest symbol of woman's confidence in man, so the
bestowal of it would imply the possession of all the human virtues on the part of him who
had proved himself a worthy recipient of it. -
None but the Perfect would be entitled to it ! The number of the Order, necessarily,
would be very limited. ..
These are the qualifications we propose, as indispensable in every candidate for the Order:-
He must have been married ten years; but, if married to a widow, five years of service will
be deemed sufficient.
During that period he must never have been out of temper once.
He must have given money as often as it was
needed, and always in the precise sum that was
asked. -
He must never have objected to go out shop-
ping with his wife, or to take her to the Opera,
or the Theatre, or to a Concert, whenever the
fancy seized her.
He must never have accepted an invitation
into the country, or to a picnic, or to a breakfast,
much less to a supper, unless he was duly accom-
panied on each occasion by his wife.
He must also prove that he never was known
to object to any of the servants engaged in the
household; or to express the slightest discon-
tent, at any time, at the way in which the dinner
was composed or dressed. -
He must never have kept his wife sitting up
for him, excepting he had been detained on a
Jury.
#. must have received and treated his wife's
relations with the same cordiality as if they had
been his own; and he must never have won-
dered “how long they were going to stop?”
whenever they brought their boxes to “stop a
few days.”
He must never have entered the hall, or gone
up-stairs, without first wiping his feet on the
door-mat. -
He must never have attempted to read in bed.
He must never have poked the fire after he had
been requested by his wife not to do so. -
He must never have fallen into the filthy habit
of taking snuff.
He must never have belonged to a Club
He must always have respected, with the most
unsullied reverence, the Bright Poker |
He must never have expressed a wish for
the removal of the child's cot out of his
bedroom. -
He must never have complained of the wash-
ing of his shirts; and must have had a soul so
far “above buttons,” as never to have “made a
rumpus” about the sudden loss of one.
He must never have brought a friend home to
dinner “to take pot-luck.”
Hº must never have wondered “how the money
goes l’”
He must have been perfectly free from all petty
matrimonial vices, such as cruel sarcasms levelled

at curl-papers, or impatient snarls if he cannot instantly find his slip-
pers, or satirical complaints if there are no puddings for dinner, or
clever witticisms cut upon the bonnet or velvet dress worn by his wife;
or fatherly interference in any way with the dress or education of the
children; or unkind objections to birds, cats, dogs, parrots, or gold
fish; or undue indulgence in any of the thousand little, contrarieties,
or social tyrannies, ºf; on the part of the husband, tend so materially
to ruffle the smoothness of the domestic hearth-rug. -
And lastly,–ſor, after all, these are two of the most important
domestic qualifications—he must, never have smoked in the house,
either in his wife's presence, or when she was away in the country,
and he must never have objected to act as warming-pan, by always
going in winter to bed first. . . -
The Husband who, after a trial of only ten years, presented himself
for election with the above simple qualifications—duly attested by
the signature of his wife, and guaranteed by two old maids, whose
united ages must amount to not less than 110 years, would be
declared honourably entitled to the Order. And we maintain that the
immaculate individual, who walked upright through the drawing-rooms
of the world with the silver Latch-key dangling from his button-hole,
would command more respect than the proudest General who strutted
about with the Garter round his leg, or the craftiest Diplomatist, who
illumined the most aristocratic Salon with a whole firmament of Stars
upon his breast. Women would courtesy reverently to him, and men,
when they met him, would take their hats off, as to a superior being.
Depend upon it, the “ORDER of the Latch-KEy.” would soon rank
as the most honourable and exclusive Order in the World... We should
wonder if, after its institution, there was a single Bachelor left in
the land. Every one would marry upon the mere chance of belonging
to such an Order!
THE FRENCH CONSTITUTION.
THE President of the Republic is responsible (to the Republic's
President). -
Being responsible to the President, the President will do as he
deems fit. . -
The President will have Ministers, who will and must be honoured by
thinking as the President shall cogitate.
The higher the President is placed, the more has he the need of
faithful councillors; and the greater the need the President may have
of them, the less the call the President proposes to make upon them.
... Thus, the Government is free in its movements, and enlightened in
its progress.
A Chamber, to be called “the Legislative body,” will vote laws and
taxes. This Chamber, to begin with, will be of about 260 members; but
the ſewer the better, in order to guarantee the calmness of deliberation.
History and philosophy having proved that the fewer the number, the
less the mobility and ardour of the deliberative body; hence, 60 may
be better than 360; 6 better than 60, and 1 better than 6.
The deliberations of the Assembly will not, henceforth, be allowed to
run yerbosely riot in the public prints, but will be given with drum-
head brevity in the President's own newspaper.
The Legislative body will pass laws, but will neither originate nor
amend them. -
Much time having been lost in vain interpellations, no questions will
be asked; or if asked, none answered.
. Another assembly bears the name of the Senate. It will be its func-
tion to deliberate according to the direction of the President; and will
contain all the illustrious names and talent that may not have been
transported.
Thus, the º: remains master of its destiny.
Such are the ideas, such the principles, that you have authorised me
to a -

Constitution. Amen. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte.

English penman, the Editor of the Morning Post, for an early copy of
the above precious document.
THE GRAWESEND EAGLE TO LOUIS NAPOLEON.
Y DEAR Louis,
“I am the poor Eagle
whom you bought at Gravesend
for half-a-guinea. Don't you
recollect you carried me in the
steamer to Boulogne, when we
were both captured—your flight
on that occasion being as rapid
as º own?
“I was kept as a trophy for
some time at the Caserne. My
feet were chained to the Cham-
pagne-case, which, you must re-
member, you also took with you
on that memorable occasion,
with the view of turning the
heads of the Army. Little chil-
dren came and laughed at me.
Strangers pointed their um-
brellas and their jokes at my
forlorn condition. I was the
laughing-stock of the whole
place.
“I sickened, of course, during
* captivity. My eagle-eye lost
all its fire. I could not look
at a candle, much less the
Sun, without , winking. My
pinions moulted to a miserable

- didn't die of the pip. --- -
uld rise some day kept the godſy ichor within me.
I heard, my dear Louis, that you also were imprisoned, and
suffered much the same as I did. I felt for you—and I ask you to feel
now as much for me.
“I am at present confined in the shambles at Boulogne-fed upon
filthy garbage, instead of the heavenly ambrosia I should receive from
you. After the soldiers and children had grown tired of ridiculing me,
I was sent as a present to the Abattoir of the town. There I have
remained ever since—and I now write to you, my dear Louis, to
demand my liberation. You have restored the Eagle to the shakos and
drapeaur of your brave soldiers. You surely will not allow, then, your
favourite bird—whom you introduced, perched on your own imperial
#: to France—to pine and perish at a slaughter-house at
oulogne : -
“Our misfortunes have hitherto been the same. It is but right that
our careers should henceforth continue the same.
“It is evident, Louis, that we are birds of the same feather., Our
flight, our degradation, our captivity, our griefs, were all F. the
same You are now elevated-so’i am told—into a high position on
the dead bodies of your countrymen. Our positions are still the same.
Your throne is at the Tuileries; mine, at a slaughter-house; but there
is no difference between the two; for the foundation of both is—
(there’s no mincing the word)—ButchERY | -
“So, my dear Louis, Icall upon you—at least I will, as soon as Ihave
regained my liberty—to set me free. Cut this odious chain, which
holds me by the leg, and, in the words of your prophetic soul, your
Uncle, I will fly from steeple to steeple, until I alight on the towers of
Notre Dame, there to shelter Paris under my wing, and to watch the
fighting that takes place on the Boulevards—your Austerlitz!
“Relying on your princely generosity, and claiming the benefits of
the restoration which you have accorded to all other Eagles in France,
“I remain, my dear Louis, at the Abattoir,
“Awaiting my liberation,
“Your favourite Bird,
“THE GRAVEsend EAGLE.”
“P.S.–If you refuse to receive me at the Tuileries, or the Opera, will
you give me a free passage by the first steamer back to Gravesend?”

We are told by the papers that directions have been given to permit
Colonel Colt to export 450 revolving fire-arms of various sizes “for
officers at the Cape.” And why not—Punch asks—for the common

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ALLOCUTION TO THE POPE.
Y DEAR Pope, I see that you have been
expressing your gratitude to the French
army for what it has done in France, or
rather what it has been employed to do
by Louis NAPOLEoN ; and your Jesuits
and other emissaries and partisans are
every where rejoicing at the support
afforded by the military power to your
priesthood throughout the Continent
generally.
Were I in your place, now, I should
take a very different view of affairs.
My situation would occasion great grief
to my paternal heart, as §. say, in your
flowery manner. I should consider my-
self dislodged from the hearts of men,
and should regard it as no triumph that
§ I was imposed on their shoulders: a

You would not, my dear Pope, I think,

with posts and beams of iron and timber.
I cannot see any reason why you should be more happy to behold the See
of St. PETER—as you call the Papacy-leaning on cannon and bayonets.
. The secular arm may be used, with some advantage to wring the
joints or scorch the nerves of individual or isolated heretics. But to
be obliged to rest upon it entirely, my dear Pope, is a proof that—if I
may address you in the language of your most devoted servants—you
have no other leg to stand upon. -
I should be afraid, my dear Pope, if I were you, that few now
retained any faith in me, except the despots lº me, and that
their sole belief in me was a mistaken notion that I had a hold on the
superstition of their slaves., I should fear that the alliance of Tyranny
and Popery was a compact between the blind and the blind to render
each other that mutual assistance, the necessary result of which you
know, of course, although you may keep that information from your
votaries. Yes, my dear Pope—slightly to vary one of our juvenile
poems—
Hush-a-by! Pontiff, upon the sword's prop;
When the world moves the Popedom will rock;
When the prop breaks the structure will fall,
And down comes Papacy, Pontiff, and all.

warning of its approach from

THE SEWEN WONDERS OF A YOUNG LADY.
1. KEEPING her accounts in preference to an Album.
2. Generously praising the attractions of that “affected creature”
who always cut her out.
3. Not ridiculing the man she secretly preſers—nor quizzing what
she º admires.
4. Not changing her “dear, dear friend” quarterly—or her dress
three times a-day. -
5. Reading a novel without looking at the third volume first; or
writing a letter without a postscript; or taking wine at dinner without
saying “the smallest drop in the world; ” or singing without “a bad
cold;" or wearing shoes that were not “a mile too § for her.”
6. Seeing a baby without immediately rushing to it and kissing it.
7. Carrying a large bouquet at an eyening party, and omitting to
ask her partner “if he understands the language of flowers.”
Switzerland in Danger.
THE Times enumerates the many dear obligations owed by the French
President to Switzerland. In which case, Panch would earnestly
advise Switzerland to be prepared for a tremendous instance of the
President’s gratitude.
“sentenced For TEN YEARs—”
THE President of the Republic has been elected for ten years... We
think that, by that time, not only will the term of the President's
power, but the prosperity of France will, also, be—Decade (Decayed).
A QUEER QUERY QUASHED.—We have long been puzzled to know
to what Book we should ascribe the oft-quoted “Chapter of Accidents.”
Experience, however, is now daily convincing us, that the Book in
question can be no other than Bradshaw's Railway Guide.
A DREAM OF REVOLUTION.
WE dreamt that a revolution had taken place in England; though to
dream such a thing, of course, we had a most extravagant vision.
We dreamt that we were not blessed with a VicTokIA THE FIRST, but
cursed with a JAMES THE THIRD, who, instead of resisting the Papal
Aggression, had backed it by making SIR JAMES, GRAHAM Prime
Minister, with a Cabinet composed of the Irish Brigade, and had
appointed CARDINAL WisemAN for Lord Chancellor. Then we dreamt
a general insurrection had occurred, and JAMEs, having shaved off his
whiskers had escaped to Paris under the name of Monsieur Tonson.
Next we dreamt that a Provisional Government had been formed,
consisting of the contributors to Punch; that the Chartists had risen
and barricaded Cheapside and Fleet Street, but had been defeated with
much slaughter. After these events, that the people had unanimously
elected SMITH O'BRIEN Protector of the British Commonwealth, and
that the hero of the cabbage-garden had been recalled from exile to sit
in the seat of CROMWELL. --- - -
Lastly, we dreamt that SMITH, not being able to get on with his
Parliament, upset the established order of things, at a blow, early one
morning, shot several thousands of those who happily are, as it is, HER
MAJEsty's subjects; suppressed the Times, and all the other news-
papers, except the Morning Post ; compelled Lord JoHN RUssell, the
DUKE of WELLINGtoN, MR. DisrAELI, and all our chief soldiers and
statesmen to leave the country; sent Colonel, SIBTHoRP and Mr. Punch
to the Tower; packed off Lord BRough AM in a police van to Coldbath
Fields Prison; transported MEssRs. BRIGHT, HUME, and Cobden,
with a multitude of their constituents, to Norfolk Island; and con-
cluded by giving old England a new Constitution, creating a House of
Lords to legislate with closed doors, and a House of Commons wherein
Ministers were not to sit, which was not to originate, or move amend-
ments on, any Act of Parliament, and the debates of which were not to
be published, except as doctored by official authority. . .
W. woke, crying, “Qh oh!” and found that our vision had been
a case of what philosophers call “suggestive dreaming”—suggested by
recent events in France, the realities of which were even worse than
anything we had dreamt of.

OUR COAST DEFENCES.
LARMists we are not; but really,
when we were at Margate
last summer, we could
not help wondering what
the Beadle — the only
visible authority in the
place—would do in case
of an invasion. Even
suppose the Camera. Ob-
scura were to be fortified,
it would not hold more
than a solitary gun; and,
as to the few fishing boats,
not all the donkeys that
Margate contains could
convert the craft into
jackass frigates. . Besides,
we fear the habits of the
Margate population, who
bow their heads mecha-
nically to every , fresh
arrival, would induce
* them, from the mere force
of custom, to receive even
a foreign foe with the
ceremonious politeness
usually shown towards
arriving customers. We
fear that if GENERAL St.
ARNAUD, at the head of
-- - - ---- an army, were to land
- - - upon the Jetty, he would
be invited to take six hot baths before he had marched to the top of the
High Street, and that a whole string of flies would be placed at his
disposal by the obsequious drivers, amid cries of “Ramsgit” from a
crowd of mercenary competitors. We have no doubt that the French
general would at once be “asked in” at all the bazaars, and invited to
put down his sixpence, as one of sixty in a raffle for a talking doll, or a
muffineer, or a set of china jugs, or some other of those watering-place
prizes, which are usually won by somebody who has gone away a week
ago, and forgotten all about it.
Qur Coast defences are certainly not strong at Margate; and, at
.." things are not much better; for though the pastry-cook
declares in his window that he “supplies Balls,” there is nothing
apparently from which Balls could be conveniently fired. It is true
that, towards the end of the West Cliff, there is a pile of round iron
things, which are popularly supposed to be ammunition; and there is a
cannon at hand; but we rather fancy that the round things alluded to
are, considerably too large for the cannon's mouth; and, even if they
could be thrust down its rude throat, they would be not unlikely to
stick in it. . Under all these circumstances, we think it would not be
objectionable to make our watering-places somewhat more suitable than
they are for firing places in the event of the approach of an enemy.

THE SHARP-SHOOTER'S CHORUS.
TUNE.—“The Huntsman's" ditto.
OH!, who, when our own native land is in danger,
Whatever his disinclination to strife
Wouldn't learn how to shoot like a wild forest ranger,
For his country, his business, his QUEEN, and his wife?
Oh! pick that JóñN BULL out his cash who’d not pull out,
Some five or six guineas would be the outside,-
*nd that little trifle invest in a rifle,
Of any invader to riddle the hide'
La, la, la, &c.
Come all you bold sportsmen, dead certain of dropping
The pigeon so fleet as it soars from the trap;
And you whose delight and amusement is popping
Away at the sparrows—come, every young chap;
The chase in the bushes of blackbirds and thrushes,
The wagtail's pursuit, it is time you should quit;
Young Epping and Tooting, come now give up shooting
The tuneful cock-robin and noisy tom-tit.
La, la, la, &c.
The finch on the palings, the fowl on the railings,
Henceforth must no longer afford you a mark;
Nor sitting or singing must you go on flinging
Your powder and shot all away on a lark.
You slayers of pullets—at targets, with bullets,
Now leaving the poultry alone, must let fly;
The ducks and geese sparing—to muster repairing,
With nobler endeavour to strike the “bull's eyel ”
- La, la, la, &c.
Abed, after sunrise, no longer lic dozing;
Get up like a Briton and haste to the drill,
Again, too, at eve, when the shops, early closing,
The prentice and foreman release from the till.
Go, surgeons, physicians—all sorts and conditions-
Go, tailors, go, artists who fashion the shoe,
Go, butchers, go bakers, and even, ye Quakers,
For once stretch a point, if you can, and go too.
La, la, la, &c.
Go, lawyers—postponing the business of suitors-
Should foreign aggression on Britain impend;
And leaving sharp practice, the skill of sharp-shooters,
The cause of the nation acquire to defend.
Up trees, behind hedges, 'mid rushes and sedges,
From thickets and brakes, from church-tower and house-top,
Let each hand be ready, determined, and steady,
Unerring of aim, at the rascals to pop.
La, la, la, &c.
MEETING A GAS-METER.
-
ºº
l
Of all the nuisances of living in a cheap neighbourhood, none is to be
compared—not even the º nuisance—to the one of having to meet
on your way home some fifty jets of gas, which rush up to you as if
they had something confidential to whisper in your ear. Butchers
particularly encourage this nuisance. They cannot turn the gas inside
their shops, for then there would be a chance of all the joints which
were hanging, in its proximity being slowly cooked by gas; so they
twist it outside, and roast the public with it.
A Correspondent writes to say that, during the culinary process, he
has had a valuable new hat done to a turn, and a whisker completely
burnt to rags. As he has to meet thisſ". broadside every night,
he is afraid that the other whisker will soon perish under a similar
fire, and he wishes to know if he cannot recover damages for the assault,
which he modestly values at £500–£250 each whisker. We will lay
the case before MR. BRIEFLEss.

CREDAT JUDAEUS 1
“Asian Mystery” has
again made its appear-
ance in MR. DisrAELI's
Bentinck, weregret that
it does not seem to be
attracting as much at-
tention as it used to do.
And yet it is backed up
this time by the “Se-
mitic Element l’’ This
is a pity. In these
troublous times, a guide
is very much wanted;
and we should not
neglect a gentleman
who, when the public
roads to glory are all
in confusion, proposes
to imitate the Strand
omnibuses, in a similar
dilemma, and take us
there —through Holy-
well Street.
It must be admitted
that MR. D. is thorough-
ly national. For as the
reat art of the modern
j. is to invest aged
raiment (or to adopt a
phrase borrowed from
the language of the
Northern Barbarian—“Ou” clo”) with the gloss and loveliness of
youth, so doth he endow old things with brilliant newness. The
ews are no longer Jews to him, * “Sephardim” or “Bedouin
Arabs,” or “conservators of the Semitic Element; ” and thus Hounds-
ditch becomes beautiful to the eye by the national art. The Jew,
whom we know—the guardian of Chancery Lane—the mild pilgrim of
Ratcliffe Highway—when dipped in the patent ink of MR. D.-comes
out glossy and romantic as a sº Emir. The art is undeniable.
But how do these creations—wear? Will our theoretical garments
fit? do they fly asunder in the seams when tried on by the logical Bar:
º: Let us try. Let us stop the gentleman who cries “Ou'clo,”
and see.
But for Music—quoth Mr. D.—we might say, that in modern times
the Beautiful (with a big B) was dead! And the Jews are our musi-
cians. Well, there is nothing like instruction' We did think that the
Northerns had done something for the Beautiful (with a big B), in the
persons of Shakspeare, Milton, Shelley, Keats, and Tennyson; to say
nothing of a painter and a cathedral or two. And we used to have a
National music in one or two countries. But no The Jews did it
all. The real music is that of the Jew’s Harp!
There was a thing called Progress, in Europe, which meddled a good
deal with old institutions. Would you know what it all amounts to—
French Revolution and all?—“The revolt ºf the Cºlts.”. Ethnologists
have discovered other elements besides the Celtic in the French people.
And certain Teutonic writers have helped modern progress a good deal.
But no : the Celts revolted, and that’s what it all amounts to. Poor
Celts! Why, we used to believe—judging from Ireland and Brittany
—that they were the most faithful supporters of all “ou’clo” extant
in Europe.
Well! The Jews, it seems, are conscious of their ill-treatment.
They join Secret Societies. They (for the evils complained of by the
Barbarians have nothing to do with it; their leaders are nobodies)
topple, over thrones with delight. Bless us, what a picture! And
what does it suggest ? Now, we know why SHADRAch is a Sheriff's
Qfficer! “All is race.” What a picture of cool malignity is this
SHADRagh taps us on the shoulder with a fiendish luxury, and exults
in dragging of the Northern Barbarian. He luxuriates in lººking up
the Frank in a sponging-house; he charges him for the “Semitic
Element,” and sticks it on to the chop and sherry.
A theory so beautiful demands every ornament. No wonder
Messrs. AARON employ a poet. The Hebrew loves the Beautiful.
But why does not, MR. Disraeli give the charm of verse to the
advertisements of his theoretical “slops?” May we offer him our
humble verses in that line; and present him with the Song due to his
Race-though he who sings be but the lowly Frank?
We all are now by cold within
The lonely house confined;
'Tis time we all should get some Win-
ter Clothing for the Mind.
B. DISRAELI invites all Gents
To his new stock, so smart,
And will, at very small expense,
Keep warm the youthful heart.
His Hebrew Cloak is fitted so
(With new Semitic Hood),
It hides whatever’s worn below,
And still to turn is good!
Bright Wests, to suit an open breast,
B.D.’s warehouses keep;
And for poor farmers much distress'd,
Protection Buckskins-cheap.
This sort of rhyme would answer very well to the reason we have
been dealing with.
A NATIVE AND FOREIGN PROFESSOR.
A certAIN PROFEssoR TAYLoR is advertising “Magic, Clairvºyancº,
and Ventriloquism, Parisian Delusions, Indian and Chinese. Feats.”
However great an adept the PROFEssoR may be in Ventriloquism,
Clairvoyance, and Magic, we will back Louis NAPOLeon against him
in the production of Parisian Delusions that really impose on the
Parisians, and in the performance of Feats of Oriental Despotism equal
to any ever exhibited in India or China.

A Perfect Character.
The Daily News (which, by the way, has been kept out of bad com-
Fº by being prohibited in Austria) expresses astonishment that the
"rench Thing-a-mee (otherwise President) should determine upon confis-
cating all the property of the ORLEANs family. Now, where is the matter
for surprise? To make the º the assassin of the liberty
of a nation, has only to become the robber of a family.
A slight DIFFERENCE.
“Goose-CLUBs” have been plentifully prevalent in London this
Christmas. But at Paris, we should say, such is the pleasantly existing
state of political as well as social liberty, that the “Clubs” are prin-
cipally “Gone-Goose” Clubs now.
Something Racy.
NUMERous important subjects are now before us; but the topic most
worthy of our attention, at present, we consider to be that of GoLDNER's
Preserves, since we tº: could not fly at higher game.

MR. DISRAELL AND THE JEWS.
SoME of our contemporaries have fallen foul of MR.DIsrAELI, for
certain hardy opinions in his Political Biography of Lord GeoRGE
BeNTINck, touching the Jews. MR. Disraeli justifies the act that
made the Hebrews an outcast people. He says:-
“The immolators were pre-ordained like the victim, and the holy race supplied both.
Could that be a crime which secured for all mankind eternal joy? which vanquished
Satax, and opened the gates of Paradise?”
Hence, the Jews, by that tremendous act, are the great benefactors of
mankind: a fact that MR. DiskAELI is, no doubt, prepared most
logically to work out. Now, if the “immolators” were the means of
securing to mankindeternal § {. about the arch-betrayer? Surely
we owe a debt to him. Let MR. Disraeli ponder this, and propose a
great recognition of the benign treason. e make him a present of a

“Nemo me impune lacessit.”
“Dieu et mon Droit’” will
also serve; and this latter
reminds us of a saying, or
maxim, which, mutatis mu-
tandis, comes to the same
thing: “A fair day's wages
for a fair day's work.”
Mr. Punch is the uniform

the º: rhetoric, pathos,
comicality, irony, burlesque,
that Mr. Punch possesses,
and any other abilities or
ſº with which he ma
- ave been endowed, will
therefore always be exerted to induce the . to concede reason-
able leisure for rest and recreation to the employed.
Mr. Punch is disgusted when he hears the Capitalist call himself
“Capital” and term the Labourer “Labour,” and act towards him as
Abstraction to Abstraction, instead of as. Man to Man. Nor does
Mr. Punch ever lose an opportunity of insisting on the short-sightedness
and folly of such unwise as well as unfeeling conduct.
But Mr. Punch, in ‘....: the social, claims of the labourer
considers it necessary, not only to limit himself to constitutional
measures, but to confine himself to means which are practical: and, in
acting for themselves, Mr. Punch would recommend workmen to follow
his example.
Hence, it may be surmised, that Mr. Punch would deprecate the
course of operatives banding together, with a view to coerce employers
into adopting such and such arrangements respecting hours or rate of
work, and amount of wages. Mr. Punch does not question the right to
combine: he only says that two can play at that game. The game
plºyed at is the game of starvation; and Mr. Punch is of opinion that
‘Labour” would be tired of it before “Capital.”
Two pictures present themselves to the mental vision of Mr. Punch.
One is that of a brawny mechanic returning home tired, indeed, and
his paper cap somewhat moist from overwork, and hungry as well as
tired; but a supper awaiting him, in some degree, proportionate to his
appetite; a good-tempered wife to welcome him; and children who
easantly remind him of “competition,” by struggling to “climb his
nee;” or, at any rate, are quietly asleep. The other is that of a poor
creature out at heels, and out at elbows—in consequence of being out
of work—without any home to return to at all, singing a ballad of his
miseries about the streets—with a ragged wife, and children in tatters
for chorus—to the tune of “Portugal,” or “Adeste Fideles.”
Now, Mr. Punch considers it a sad pity that an English artisan who
could once sit for the first of these portraits, should ever be reduced to
stand for the second: but what makes the pity doubly sad, is that the
wretched alteration should have been owing to a mistake in political
economy—an abortive attempt to control the labour-market.
The pen is now added to the list of the intelligent workman’s tools.
He can use his tongue as well as his fingers, Mr. Punch would like to
see him availing himself to the utmost of these means to bring his
cause before the tribunal of public opinion, where it will be just
judged, and the decision of which will sooner or later enforce itself.
But ilr. Punch would dissuade him from the desperate expedient of
quarrelling with those on whom his bread depends; a step, which, ten
to one, will plunge him, individually, in ruin. The public will not be so
chivalrous as to back him in a conflict with the law of supply and
demand; it has not even generosity enough to encourage a combination
of Poor Law doctors against boards of guardians; or a strike of
attenuated curates against bloated pluralists,

MRS. BAKER'S PET.
THE PET Is Found AGAIN, To THE DEEP DISGUST OF MR. BAKER, WHO
FLATTERED HIMSELF THE HOUSE WAS RID OF HIM, AND HAD
BECOME QUITE CHEERFUL AGAIN IN CONSEQUENCE.
SCENE 6.-MR. and MRs. BAKER at Breakfast.
Mr. Baker. Another cup of tea, my dear; I have such an appetite
this morning—indeed, for the last two or three mornings—I’m quite
a new man. -
Mrs. Baker (sighs). Yes—I’ve remarked º dear.
Mr. Baker. But you’ve been in the dumps lately, my dear.
Mrs. Baker (sighing again). Oh-no-nothing!—I feel much as usual.
Mr. Baker (rather gingerly). Now, my dear-you won't be angry with
me—but I’m afraid your mind’s running on that dog.
Mrs. Baker (with a bitter sense of wrong). Well, MR. BAKER, I hope
{ may # permitted my feelings without remark—I’m sure I keep them
o myself.
Mr. Baker. Certainly—my dear—but—
Mrs. Baker (with continued bitterness). I am well aware that I need
not look for sympathy from you, MR. BAKER.
Mr. Baker. Well, but my dear—
Mrs. Baker (with more bitterness than ever). I am quite aware of the
nature of your feelings towards that poor animal, from the first moment
he came into the house-kicks—and blows-and bad language. Poor
thing ! I’m sure he has had a happy release.
[Shows an intention of giving way.
Mr. Baker (who feels this is too bad). Confound it, MRs. BAKER!
You forget what I’ve suffered from the nasty brute; the way he flew
at me the very first day; the dreadful manner he howled that night;
the nuisance he has been to the neighbours; in short, ma'am, the way
he’s poisoned my happiness! There— [Rising indignantly,
Mrs. Baker (rising in her turn). Oh! by all means, Sir—throw it all
on that poor dumb animal—your bad speculations—and your ill-temper-
and your neglect of your home, Sir—and of me. But it’s very well I
should know the worst. The poor dog is gone, and perhaps I may not
be long here to annoy you—and—I’m sure—I hope—when—I’m—
—g—g—one— [Gires way to a gush of tears.
Mr. Baker (forgetting his wrath). Now, MRs. BAKER—now, JANE;
don't be so deuced ridiculous. There—you know very well there isn't
a better husband in the Row—and I’m sure I’m quite satisfied you're
an excellent wife. Don't cry—there—and never mind that d-d dog.
Mrs. Baker (witheringly, through her nearly dried tears). MR. BAKER!
Mr. Baker. Well, then, never mind your pet; you shall come into
town with me to-day, and we'll just look in at HolyEs and
EveRINGTON's ; there’s that shawl you admired so last week; come,
get on your things—the 'bus will be up this instant.
Mrs. Baker (mollified). Thank you, MR. BAKER ; but I really don't
feel equal to it to-day—in a few days, perhaps—
Mr. Baker. And promise me you won't make a fool of yourself any
more about that dog!
Mrs. Baker. Now, MR. BA—(knowing what was coming, BAKER has
made a rapid retreat)——His spite against that poor dumb animal is
perfectly extraordinary. Oh! I wonder if MR. CHALKER has found that
dreadful MR, CARROTs. If they should have boned his poor dear ears,
and cut off his poor dear tail—I’m sure I quite feel as if it was my
own.
Enter SPRIGGLEs (mysteriously).
Spriggles (in a comfidential manner). It’s CHALKER, 'm.
Mrs. Baker. Oh! JAMEs ; has he found—

who wears the costume already described, with the addition of a
black eye. He walks with some unsteadiness; but on entering
the room smoothes down his hair, and tries to look meek and
respectable, though with indifferent success.

Mrs. Baker (in agony). Oh! but there will be time, before it sails—
Chalker. Wich CARROTs swore dreadful bad, that over he goes if the

PROCLAMATION BY PUNCH.
QQuº it has come to our knowledge that there are many persons in all parts of
the United Kingdom, who are desirous of forming themselves into Rifle Clubs, and
are only deterred from doing so by the fear that they may be turned into targets for the
arrows of our ridicule: This is to give notice to all such persons as aforesaid, that so far from
making them the subjects of satire, we shall applaud the excellence of their aim; and
instead of administering to them even a playful slap in the face, we shall pat them on the
back by way of encouragement.
3e it #ngton tº all ſtien by thrge 33rcăcnts, as well as by the past and the future,
that we shoot only folly as it flies; but we cannot regard national spirit standing to its guns,
as folly of any sort, and certainly not of a flying description.
... We therefore promise our gracious encouragement to all, persons exercising themselves
in the use of arms with a view to their country's defence: and we hereby undertake that not
a shot shall be fired against them from any of our batteries.

MR.PUNCH,-I am the Beadle of St. Dimity’s, and I wish to ask you a short question.
I see it is now the fashion for clergymen to have what I believe is called, “a division of
labour" in the marriage service; that is, when a Bishºp, or a Dean, or a Rector, as he may be,
pays the compliment of marrying a couple, he is “assisted” in the ceremony by another
harson, .Now, Mr. Punch, what I wish to ask is this: if the name of the parson who

With the discarded Cock of Gaul,
Which had the better right to brag,
And decorate the Nation's flag.
By way of ending their debate,
They ask’d a Goose to arbitrate:
The Cock recounted all his mains;
The Eagle number'd his campaigns
Then on their claims of rival pride
The Goose proceeded to decide.
“Neither,” said this judicious Goose,
“Founds his pretensions upon use.
Each of you tells the self-same story,
And wholly rests his cause on glory-
To wit, when all is said and done,
Upon so many battles won.
I’ve listened to your several tales,
And weigh’d your pleasin honest scales.
It seems to me, in equal measure,
That you have both cost blood and treasure:
I say, perpending time and chance,
Each has alike done harm to France,
And blest that wise and happy nation
With death, and pain, and mutilation;
Filled it with sighs, and tears, and groans,
And foreign graves with Frenchmen's bones;

M. LOUIS NAPOLEON,
PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SLEIGHT OF HAND,
AND SLIGHT OF EVERYTHING ELSE,
Has the honour (?) to inform the Public that he intends continuing his
extraordinary Performances, and playing his unprecedented Tricks, until
further notice.
The Programme will be selected from the unrivalled stock of ILLU-
sIons and IMpositions, which he has lately, practised with so much
success at Paris, assisted by his unrivalied Collection of
Ministerial, AND MILITARY AUTOMATONS.
Among the principal Tricks of the present season will be found-
1.-The Inexhaustible Ballot Box.
From which eight millions of white balls will be produced; by a coup
de main, which defies all detection.
2.-The Celebrated Gun Trick.
(As practised on the 2nd and 3rd of December, 1851, in the Boulevards of Paris.)
In the course of this wonderful experiment, combining the character-
istics of a coup d'état and a coup de tête, the spectators will have an
opportunity of catching the bullets in their own heads, so as to leave no
doubt of the reality of the experiment.
3.—The Automaton Soldier.
A piece of mechanism of the greatest perfection, which will load his
musket and fire it in the face of any person whom M. Louis NApoleon
may indicate.
4. The Ministerial Puppets.
These little imitations of humanity will go through the whole official
routine; and though without the smallest intelligence, will bow their
wooden heads, and sign decrees, or any other documents, at a mere nod
from their master.
5. The official Second Sight.
M. Louis Napoleon will, with the aid of a police spy-glass, read the
most private papers in the possession of individuals, and not only tell
their thoughts, but transport them, before they are aware of it, to
Cayenne, and other remote regions, for having entertained the opinions
which his police spy-glass has made him acquainted with.
6. The Escamotage d'une Dame.
Consisting of the total disappearance of La Belle France, under a
dictatorial extinguisher.
The Tricks will be accompanied by all sorts of Airs, performed by a
Band of Military Instruments.
Places can only be secured by application to M. Louis NApoleon.
No Money returned. Wivat Nobody.
corruption in The NAVY.
“SELF-PREs ERwation is the First Law of Nature,” and that may be
one of the reasons why sailors refuse to touch the “preserved meats”
furnished by the Admiralty.
THE FRENCH WULTURE.
NATURAL historians are puzzled to determine what sort of fowl is
the bird calling itself the French Eagle. That it belongs to the Eagle
family at all, the only indication is afforded by its łº, which are
enormous, and exhibit an extent of grasp truly astonishing. But the
yoracity and gleediness for which it is remarkable are rather charac-
teristic of the vulture, or the carrion crow, and its trick of pouncing on
the defenceless is a trait of the kite's. Moreover, it displays a wonder-
ful º at feathering its nest, which is foreign to the aquiline
nature. This nondescript creature (now in full feather at the Tuileries)
has in three years increased its depredations in France to the amount
of from, £25,000 to £140,000 per annum. It does not, however, prey
singly, but divides its spoil with a number of associates, reserving to
itself what, if it were a quadruped, might be described as the lion's
share. Thus gregarious in its rapacity, it presents another mark of
affinity to the vultures; and as the appellation of King Vulture is
already º its instincts, which are markedly imperious,
suggest that the title most appropriate to the inclinations ºthis Wulture
would be the Emperor.

A REAL BLESSING (?) TO MOTHERS
The Italian correspondent of the Times mentions that,
"His Holiness, on the 4th, gave his benediction to a quantity of baby-clothes,
which he is sending as a present to the young Princess of Spain.”
We should like to know what effects are supposed to result from
the papal benediction conferred on baby-linen. Isit supposed to endow
the vestments in question with the property of resisting infection and
contagion, so as to protect the infant wearer from measles, or to serve
the child in lieu of vaccination? Or does it only communicate anti-
heretical properties to the long clothes? Or when any ordinary old
woman blesses the dear little cap, or bib, or tucker, of any little
creature, are not those articles as truly blessed, and the baby, to all
intents and purposes, as much a “blessed baby” as when the *:::::
tion is uttered, merely with greater fuss, by a Pope?
Good News from Austria.
The Times' Vienna Correspondent writes, that, “since the resignation
of Lord PALMERston, the relations between this court and the British
Embassy have been infinitely more cordial.” ...Well, this is something
gained. What a pity it is, that certain prejudices of the English Con-
stitution do not allow of the deportation of the Ex-Foreign Secretary to
Vienna, even as other statesmen are sent to Cayennel We can, in
some degree, estimate what we have lost with PALMERston, if with him
we have forfeited the hatred of Austria, gaining its deadly “cordiality.”
A Picture of Dismay.
Looking over the portfolio of our Insane Artist, the other morning,
we were not the least surprised—though, we admit, considerably dis-
gusted—to find the following:-
“Subject Fon Sketch-Consternation of our already-underhorsed heavy-Light
Cavalry at the Cape, on hearing that the Government had shipped for them a quantity
of Colt's 111"
We need scarcely add, that a strait-waistcoat was the immediate
sequitur; and our Insane Artist is now safely inhaling his native air
in—Bedlam.

MR. BrodeRIP, in his Leaves from the Note-Book of a Naturalist,
says:-
“When CUVIER last visited this country, and was feasted by some of our philoso-

long dwelt.”
No doubt Cuvier had discovered no end of Ichthyosaurs, and Plesio-
saurs, and Iguanodons, and Pterodactyles: but we will adventure to
say, that no fossil reptile that he ever met with, pleased him half so
much as the existing species of Chelonian that he got at the Albion:
and that he regarded as by far the most interesting fruit of his researches
in Natural History the discovery of real turtle.

credible authority,+which every-
body knows is just now none at
all—that the President, desirous
of bringing the country into accord
with the ideas of the [Empire,
intends issuing a decree, that, no
carriage, of any description, shall
be allowed to exist without an
Imperial attached to it. If anyone
should attempt to resist this pro-
º respect to Imperial souvenirs
his luggage, will be seized, and
himself, with, all his family, will
be transmitted to Cayenne, to wait
the pleasure of the President.
Another rumour, is, that. Louis
NApoleon, in order to show the respect entertained by the English
nation for the Imperial regime, has ordered the seizure, at any con-
venient place in England, of five thousand pewter pots, for the1.
of distribution among the French, and accustoming them to Imperial

THE DRAMA IN THE INSOLVENT COURT.
HERE was an interesting
question debated last
week in that Court of
Ease to the Theatre,
the Insolvent Court.
A slight difference of
opinion existed between
MR. ANDERson, ex-high-
priest of that Temple of
the Drama, Drury Lane,
and MR.SULLIVAN, author
of the very pleasant
comedy of The Old Love
-º- - º j
yº and the New, brought
- * out—it will be remem-
bered—under the wet-
blanket auspices of 1851. The author required £300
h for his five-act comedy—an enormous sum in such
days, with the quartern loaf at sixpence; the more
especially when there are actors and actresses who
never demand more than £50 a night; being at the
rate of only £300 a week. The manager, it would
appear, evidently felt the boldness of the demand; but
with a delicacy of feeling, possibly peculiar to the
theatre, did not twit the audacious author with the
effrontery of his literary claims. No ; the manager
handsomely consented to give the author £300 for
his comedy, if the author would give the manager
£100 to put the comedy upon the stage. Authors
are proverbially dull, in arithmetic; nevertheless.
MR. SULLIVAN was, in some degree, an exception to the rule of ignorance.
For Old Love and New . 2300
To Manager ANDERson ... 100
£200
MR. SULLIVAN, albeit the author of a comedy, absolutely proved himself capable of the above
sum of substraction: but, when the manager wrote to the dramatist for a receipt for the
£100, the “statement puzzled him;”, he could not “give a receipt for money which he had
not received.” He therefore betook himself to the monetary manager, who at once explained
the mystery.
“MR. ANDERson said it was of no importance whatever; his only object being, he said, in asking for the receipt,
that he might show it to any one who might assert that he had got it for nothing.”
Thus, in demanding, the fictitious, or rather poetic, receipt for the £100 not received, the
manager was delicately considering the reputation of the author; whose work * or
ignorance might have undervalued, rating its cost at nil. Now there is a strong, albeit
silent argument, conveyed in a stamp receipt of 1s. 6d.--Such a beautiful bit of writing, in
the best vein of fiction of the dramatist, would have been a valuable document in the
ºn of the manager. “How full is the treasury of Drury Lane! Here is a receipt
or £100—absolutely for £100'—given to a mere author l’’. Consider the startling effect that
such a document would have had upon the theatrical world! How, shown in the manager's
room, the delighted and perhaps, astonished beholder departs from the theatre, almost awed
by a sense of #. theatre's riches. Consider that man stopping a brother professional, under
Drury Lane Colonnade, and re-awakening in his soul an almost dormant belief in the
regeneration of the Drama; for he has seen-yes, his eyes have been at once dazzled and
delighted by a receipt for £100. The glad tidings spread. An earnest knot of patrons of
the Drama look radiant and hopeful at the Garrick! Astonishment, it may be, not unmixed
with envy, seizes upon every green-room. Any way, the Drama must be regenerated, its
strength and legitimacy assured in a stamp-receipt for—£100! Next to a Note of Elegance
for a Bank Note, a º for money not received is, we take it, the most ingenious of fictions.
MR. SULLIVAN on oath—
“declared that no conversation ever took place between him and MR. Axdeason, that he was to
allow £100 for putting the comedy on the stage, either in writing or in word.”
Hereupon, MR. ANDERson's Solicitor delivered himself of a most valuable suggestion by
way of query:-
“He would ask the Court whether it was not reasonable between an author and a manager, that there should
be an equal risk? What was more reasonable than that an author should pay £100 towards putting an expensive
comedy on the stage 2"
The Court thought otherwise;
- but for ourselves, we think nothing can be more reasonable.
Why not institute at iºſ theatre the system of caution money; a system that should
guarantee managers against all loss in their anxious and unceasing endeavours to delight and
enlighten the public?. I.et it be once a rule that every dramatist, upon acceptance of his
play by the *ś. bank with him £100—not an illusionary, moonshiny receipt for the
amount, but £100 in note or gold-and what a beneficial check would be placed upon
dramatic §: What a wholesome prohibition! Any way, MR. ANDERson has
manifested great fiscalingenuity. We shall soon be compelled to change our present Chancellor
of the Exchequer. Ought the Prime Minister to pass over the j. of the ex-manager
of Drury Lane P

A REGULAR CHURCH-STEEPLE CHASE.
THE age of fox hunting parsons is supposed to have passed; but it
would appear, that we still have clerical sportsmen, for the Liverpool
;". intelligence contains some right reverend names, indicating
that there are ecclesiastics, of rival persuasions, who can run other
matches than the race of godliness. , Among the weights entered
for the Liverpool Steeple-chase, we find no less a personage than
“ST. HELIER,” put down at 10 st. 6 lb. There is also “ABBOT LAU-
RENCE,” 9 st. 10 lb.; and in friendly antagonism with this popish friar
and saint, we are gratified to observe the name of “MARIA Monk,”
9st. 8 lb. Under the head of “Handicap for the Spring Cup,” we
meet with the “PRIoR or LANERcost,” 6 st. 12 lb.; “CARDINAL WISE-
MAN,” 6 st. 10 lb., and the “ABBEssor JERVEAUx,” 6 st. 8 lb., With
these great pillars of the Roman Church, figures “EBob,” which is
short, as everybody knows, for the title of our own ARCHBishop of
York. This remarkable collocation of names, in a list of patrons of the
turf, shows the tendency of sport to make persons of opposite opinions
on, theology lay aside their polemical differences, sº meet in good
fellowship on the common ground of the race-course. It is pleasing to
find the burning rage of controversy reduced to a gentle heat of a
few miles. ..
The reflecting observer will remark the very moderate amount of the
weights ºf the eminent divines above º, since, from the apparent
bulk of any of them he may have ever seen, he would be disposed to
infer them to be much heavier. One would guess that the ARCHBishop
QF, York must weigh more than 6 st. 12 lb., the weight assigned to
“EBo...;” and we º that the physical density of CARDINAL
WISEMAN exceeded 6 st. 10 lb. It will be noticed that the CARDINAL
is given as 2 st: less than the ARchbishop; perhaps the Tablet will
assert that the list was compiled by a heretic, and that the difference
was forged in ºrder to depreciate his EMIN ENCE by representing him
as inferior to the Most Reverend PRELATE in weight. But 6 st. 12 lb.
against 6 st. 10 lb., may be said to be little better than six of one and
half-a-dozen of the other; and it is clear that neither DR. WISEMAN
nor DR. MUSGRAVE can be considered Heavy Dragoons, but, on the
. must be regarded as Light Bobs of their respective churches
Inliltant.
Of course the above observations are made on the supposition that
the weights of the parties have been correctly stated, º that those
individuals have not been treated with a degree of levity as inappro-
priate to their grave profession as it is apparently incompatible with
their bodily circumference.
In conclusion, we may express the hope that any canter that may
occur in the contest between these sacerdotal sporting characters will
be entirely devoid of cant.

A MUSICAL SNUGGERY.
SoMEBODY has advertised to give a series of “Musical Winter
Evenings,” about which there is an assumed air of snugness
and sociability that is rather unusual. The seats are not spoken
of as reserved or otherwise; but the announcements state that
“sofas to contain five may be had on application.” Five on a sofa
savours a little cf seven or eight in a bed, and the intimation be:
speaks rather too much of a cram—or, in school language," a grease”
—to be quite agreeable. Why not advertise “chairs to hold three,” and
“two stools between which one may come to the ground,” for the
junior members of a musical family?... We dare º the “evenings” are
very pleasant, but we object somewhat to the half-patronising air with
which people are asked to come to them. Instead of its being stated
in a straightforward way that the admission is seven shillings, it is
hinted in a sort of mincing manner that “members may join”—the real
fact being that anybody may join who will pay the money. . The treat
promised is something quite delicious to the lover of the classical school,
for he will get Op. 83, Hummel, and Op. 43, Spohr, on the same
evening. Some of those whose love for the classical does not quite
jump with all these Ops, may, perhaps, avail themselves of a sofa, not
for five, but for one, as a nap may be agreeable.

“The British public might have expected, that after the vast intercourse which has

learned to apply some few of the conveniences and decencies which our more fortunate
neighbours enjoy in their railway carriages to those of the second class on their own
line."
It appears that our foreign visitors to the Great Exhibition last year,
left all their dirt and none of their cleanliness to the Directors of the
Great Western Railway. The Railways made a great, deal of money
by the Exhibition: we are sorry to find that in one instance the profit
may be described as filthy lucre.

LITERATURE. THE EXCLUSIVE IRISH TUTOR.
A Dictionary of the land..#% By HERALD HARE, Esq. By Decree of the Synod of Thurles.
THIs is a very remarkable and original publication. Encouraged by the
success of the “Landed Gentry” of BURKE, MR. HARE has produced a
work on that large and important class of gentry who have no land at all.
It contains some notices of hundreds of our suburban families, with men-
tion of at least four hundred young gentlemen who have founded
branches of them in the metropolis. As it is now-a-days almost im-
possible to distinguish between “gentlemen” by outward appearances,
and, as there are many hundreds of gentlemen, information concerning
whose families is (says MR. HARE) but “scantily accessible to the
ublic,” (Preface, p. 3,) this work, cannot fail to be largely circu-
ated. Our author has to thank the heads of families, and of branches
of families, he tells us, for most courteous replies to his communi-
cations. He has rarely been refused admission to chambers, lodgings,
&c., where he wished to inspect documents—except, to use his own
words—“where a disagreeable, yet perhaps natural, mistake was made
concerning my motives, as a stranger, for penetrating inside.”
(Preface, p. 5)
. But, we must let the learned gentleman's work speak for itself }; an
extract or two. So, we will show with what orthodox felicity MR
HARE performs his part, and quote a specimen, Let us remark, that
we shall show a proper deference in doing so, by quoting his notice of
those distinguished aristocrats of the land-less party, who are far more
“nobby” than their landed rivals—who sneer at the “rabble” from the
backs of “’acks”—whose waistcoats astonish Wauxhall, and who head
the mazy dance at the TERPsichoREUMs.
“HUGSLY of BLOOMSBURY CHAMBERs.
“It was the opinion of DUGDALE (Red Lion King) that the ſounder of
the family of HUGSLY, of Clapham, of which this gentleman is a cadet,
was one WILLIAM, or BILL HUGSLY, who settled in Clapham in 1796
where he got a grant of half-an-acre of land. This he held on the feuda
condition of making certain payments in coin quarterly—which he com-
muted by one large payment in 1798. He then built Hugsly Castle,
or house (“every Englishman's house is his castle.” JENKINs, passim).
In 1801, we find him figuring in the roll of witnesses, (Rec. proc. reg.
banc.) in the petition against a return of the HoN. M.R. BALDERDASH to
Parliament, on account of treating, propter intoricationem electorum, (old
MSS.) He married ARABELLA, daughter and co-heiress of Assof that
ilk, by whom he had issue:
“ALExANDER, (Captain in the Clapham Volunteers.)
WILLIAM, m. MARY, daughter of — PEwTER, Esq., of THE TILL,
Brixton.
ELEANOR, m. – GRUBBLEs, Esq.
“The two sons dying without issue, GRUBBLEs, by right of his wife
(and with her permission), obtained the Clapham estates; and obtained
ſº.” also (from his acquaintances) to take the name and arms of
UGsly. They had–
“John Tom KINs HUGSLY (present possessor).
HENRY DE BURGH HUGsly (founder of the branch of Bloomsbury
Chambers.)
“MR. H. DE BURGH Hugsy's country seat is at Herne Bay. He
encourages sporting.
“Wears: A paletot vert; trousers, chequy, azure and sable; a waist-
coat sémée of fleurs de lis. Motto: Go it, my brickey-wicksy.”
“BIGGINs OF PUMP Court.
“The º and notoriety of the BIGGINSEs (remarks Fungus) is
proved by an old doggerel rhyme which tradition still repeats in the
neighbourhood of their ancestral Peckham:-
“‘When from ye East there comethye Dun,
Then be sure, ye Biggins will run.'
“It is probable that this scrap of doggerel refers to an old legend, which
relates how Castle Biggins was besieged by an army in the days of the
Black Prince (Regent; afterwards Geo. 4th.) The army, as the chroni-
cles narrate, encamped in their neighbourhood, and terri le efforts were
made to penetrate. This, however, was only effected by a stratagem.
The invader chief entered, disguised as a brewer, with an empty barrel:
—the proud old BIGGINs was forced to surrender.
“Since this period the fortunes of the House of BIGGINs have not been
prosperous. It is recorded among them, that when anything terrible is
going to happen to one of the family, a banshee appears-in the shape
of a hook-nosed spectre with a sharp eye, jingling a chain. This is a
signal that the course of the individual is nearly run. . . -
“The Pump Court family (consisting of his brothers) is the most dis-
tinguished branch of the old family in question.
“Motto. See Wright.”
Such is the plan of the very excellent work of MR. HARE.
HE interesting little note sub-
joined is a pretty illustration
of the kind of religious in-
struction and secular learning
imparted, in combination, by
certain pastors to certain
flocks in Ireland. It is stated
by the Newry Journal to have
been sent to a local magis-
trate by post. The writer is
evidently, a , gentleman of
strong Riband politics:—
“You bludy heretick take this
notise, lore yure land or leve the
cuentry we cannot Pay our rent the
land is so high and will we tirn our
children out beggars for the sake of
A heretick receiver you have past a
bill against our Clargy now we
have past the bill against heretick
landlords And against heretick ma.
gistrates the bludy heretick lord John
russil that past the bill you may
blame him for All that is don And
will be done in this country we will
- have ireland to our selvs we have
our police And you have your Police—so you bludy heretick you see which dos their
duty best And you will see if you get time, which of them will do their duty best if
you tirn from this date. And live and let live it may be the mains of saving yor trouh
being magistrate we will have no heretick law in ireland—sined and seled irich Police
—down with hereticks.”
In this brief document there are no less than eight distinct allusions
to heresy, most of them qualified by an epithet most strongly expressive
of the writer's † to erroneous doctrine: an antipathy so violent
that it extends to the misbeliever, and may be said, indeed, to assume,
towards him, the character of ferocious hatred. The Riband gentleman
seems to º: more forcibly to the religious opinions than even to the
|. claims of the object of his reproaches. Clearly, if he could
lave called the Protestant magistrate anything worse than a sanguinary
heretic, he would. That is the most opprobrious expression he could
think of. What exasperates him more than having rent to pay is, that
a bill nas been “past” against his “Clargy;” and he is as much
exasperated with “LoRD John RussiL’’ as with his landlord, both of
whom ne abuses and menaces in the same terms. “You”—qualified—
“heretick,” and “down with hereticks,” are the beginning, middle,
and end of his letter. His theological ardour is more intense than his
ersonal malice. Zeal for his Church has eaten this gentleman up.
is religious education has not been neglected. See what pious feelings
have been instilled into his breast. , Observe how indignant he is at i.
enactment, which has been passed to the prejudice of his “Clargy.”
His orthodoxy is more wonderful than his orthography: can there be a
doubt that both are derived from the same source?
Are not “Godless Colleges” rather preferable to a school which
teaches such godliness and such spelling?
THE ADMIRALTY PUZZLED.
It seems that much of the time of the Admiralty, and, what is of
more consequence, much of the money of the public, is consumed, in the
game, or puzzle, of !. ships together and taking them to bits
again. We have no objection to amusement under ºr. conditions;
but we really think that our national shipping is rather too expensive
a material for the diversion of ignorant authorities. They, not knowing
their business, attempt to combine instruction with entertainment, b
forming every ship into a practical puzzle, which they alternately pull
to pieces, arrange, and re-arrange, in the hope of making, something of
it at last, though they seldom succeed in doing so. The pupils at
Greenwich have a model vessel on their ground, and upon this vessel
they have the means of enlightening their, ignorance. Now, we would
propose that the Lords of the Admiralty should have a sort of toy-ship,
capable of being disjointed, and set up again, so that, when any of the
Lords required amusement, he might have a sham vessel, instead of a
real one, to play, his tricks upon. Qf course, if, after many years'
practice with the toy-vessel, any one of their Lordships more sagacious
than the rest should, unexpectedly, appear to have begun to under-
stand naval affairs, he might be permitted to try his hand upon a real
ship—beginning, of course, with the smallest craft, for fear of accident.

or

the ground of what they term “unity.” For “unity,” read “Uni

We can sympathise with CAPTAIN WARNER, in whose behalf LoRD
TALBOT has again appeared in print... His Lordship says, in a letter
to the Daily News—with reference to the Captain's annihilating engines,
whatever they may be,
“I ask you to publish my solemn declaration as to my belief in their vast im-
portance, and my sense of the folly and danger of rejecting them.”
We say we sympathise with CAPTAIN WARNER, agonised and outraged
as he must be by daily letters from all conditions of civilians, stock-
brokers, lawyers, and other such harmless, peaceful bodies, all smelling
of powder-all demanding rifle practice. Rifle practice! And CAPTAIN
WARNER has in his heart—even as in the very centre of Wesuvius—a
secret of desolation that would defy assault or opposition. Why will
not the Lords of the Admiralty give the Captain a fair trial? For these are
times, as writes the modest SIR CHARLEs NAPIER to the Prime Minister,
when even a successful Admiral is not to be snubbed. Suppose their
Lordships devote. two or three tubs of frigates or seventy-fours—the
Promedary, the Hippopotamus, or Donkey—to the experiments of CAPTAIN
WARNER If he cannot with his long range destroy them, they are
quite as good and as bad as ever: if he can blow §. to pieces, it
would be much better that he should do so, than the French. Besides,
who knows? May not Louis NAPOLEoN attempt to coax or kidnap
the Captain? We confess we are not justified in any suspicion of his
patriotism; nevertheless, we should not continue to scorn and despise
the avowed thunderbolts of a CAPTAIN JUPITER, the while certain folks
are giving all their ears—no shortcoming gift—to the pea-shooters of the
duck-legged squad.
THE LORDs (to M. NoDDIEs) of THE ADMIRALTY.
THE Fleet is in the Tagus when it is wanted to guard the English
coast... But this was sure to be the case with the Admiralty. How
could it be expected, when they have such an awful mess with the
“preserved meats” of the Navy, that they would be any more suc-
cessful in preserving “the Chops of the Channel?”
LOUIS NAPOLEON'S AIRS.
ATELY the extreme mildness of
the weather in the North
of Europe has been the
subject of remark in the
Paris papers, and it is said
that even Russia has not
been visited - by its usual
cold. The Paris press may
well talk about the weather,
there being scarcely an
other topic that the French
journals can touch upon.
he alleged mildness in
Russia may be accounted
for, perhaps, º the rules of
comparison; for after, the
severity that has existed
since the 2nd of December
at Paris, and the airs of
Louis NAPOLEoN, the air of
St. Petersburgh would seem
to the Parisians mild in the
axtreme.

- A NURSERY RHYME
FOR THE ORDNANCE OFFICE,
THERE was a little man,
And he had a clumsy gun
And a knapsack, just as heavy as lead, lead, lead;
And he was a splendid sight,
In his scarlet coat so tight,
And shako crown'd with shaving-brush on head, head, head.
In the march this little man
Soon to puff and blow began,
And found it deuced hard to keep in rank, rank, rank;
ball-cartridge, sixty rounds,
Weighing something like eight pounds,
To steady him kept bobbing at his flank, flank, flank.
And as for want of wind
The little man he grinn'd,
And “bellows all to mend” often sung, sung, sung;
With belts they cross'd his chest,
... That so might be suppress'd
The unmilitary action of his lung, lung, lung.
The little man was meant
-- - - - In a steamer to be sent,
With his regiment 'gainst the Caffres at the Cape, Cape, Cape;
But the steamer was so small
That it wouldn't hold 'em all,
And was forced to run for Plymouth, in a scrape, scrape, scrape.
But though this little man
- Has not had his little span
Of life made less by assegai or shot, shot, shot;
Other little men of pluck
- Have not had so much luck,
But their gruel from the savages have got, got, got.
For though each such little man

LIBEL DE LUNATICO.
. The Daily News has been publishing a prodigious libel—a libel
immense—according to the proverb—because an enormous truth. Our
contemporary states, that, in the late Lunacy Commission on poor
MRs. CUMMING, there were employed nineteen jurors, four counsel,
and several attorneys; the proceedings occupying sixteen days, at an
expense of £350 per day: in all, £5,600. Now, what is the publication
of facts like these but the grossest reflection on English Law P A
pauper lunatic is consigned to Hanwell at small charges: what is the
natural inference from the circumstance, that it takes between five and
six thousand pounds to determine the insanity of a wealthy lady? Of
course, that the Law of England is a cormorant, a raven, a boa-con-
strictor, avulture, a º: That the Law is a humbug, and pretends to
protect the property of lunatics, only in order to devour their substance
itself. Suppose, in one of the pantomimes, an old lady were introduced,
carrying a bundle, labelled £. s. d.: whereupon the Clown exclaims," Poor
She’s out of her mind. Let’s me and you take care of her
property:” and then, bonneting the victim, divides the spoil with the
Pantatoon ;—sure we are the Lord Chamberlain would forthwith inter-
dict so audacious a satire on the law of Lunacy. And will the ATToRNEY-
GENERAL take no notice of a statement equally calculated to bring the
law on that subject into º As it is the majesty of the Law
itself, not the dignity of any individual, that has been offended, the
Government's mode of proceeding should be, not by prosecution in the
Queen's Bench, but by Bill in the House of Commons-tending, we
would suggest, to the slight reformation of Commissions in Lunacy.
FUNNY MARKET AND WITTY INTELLIGENCE.
ſº event of the Joke Market has been the recent fact, that
several large cases of preserved jokes, intended for exportation, have
been |...} to contain matter utterly unfit for human mirth. Some of
these jokes were designed for the Colonies, which rely upon this
country, entirely for their supply of food for laughter; and it is
expected that the result will be most melancholy to the colonists.
The utter absence of anything in the shape of joke-production in
ependent on the
mother country for their mother wit; and there will, therefore, be
a sort of facetious famine, unless something is done to supply the
deficiency caused by the deplorable badness of the preserved jokes
that were destined for the Antipodes. Everything is being done to
avert the horrors of utter jokelessness in those remote districts; and
several volumes of Punch have been already despatched to the places
likely to suffer most severely from what has occurred. We had some
idea of giving a few samples of the contents of the condemned cases;
but we are fearful of contaminating our pages, by introducing into
them a kind of matter they were never intended to contain.
THE
Frustrate their Navish Tricks.
THE only mode we can suggest for dealing with those persons who
want so much of the public money as riggers of the Navy, is, to bring the
rigour of the law to bear upon one or more of them. It would do no
harm if a delinquent were to be transferred from a dock at Woolwich
or Chatham, to the dock of the Old Bailey.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THREATENED INVASION OF ENGLAND.
E have had England invaded so
often lately, and in so many dif-
ferent ways—at least on paper-
that no method of disembarking
the French on our shores seems
to be too absurd to talk about.
We wonder that the idea has
never entered anybody’s head, of
an invasion by means of balloons,
headed by Monsieur Poitevin.
Perhaps the whole French nation
might come bodily over through
the air, and, indeed, the state of
inflation to which France is liable,
would greatly favour the experi-
ment. It is strange that no
alarmist has suggested the possi-
bility of an invasion by bladders
instead of boats; for if an army
of 50,000 men were only to be
supplied with a pair of bladders
for each soldier, and the whole
50,000 were to be fastened to-
gether by a rope, they might be
towed over by one steamer, quite
as well as by any of the other
methods through which an invasion is said just now to be capable of
easy accomplishment. Paddles could, of course, be fitted up to the sides
of all the horses; and as to the guns, why should they not float across
just as well as the iron steamers which pass daily between º:
and Folkestone? These suppositions may seem rather absurd, but they
are not more so than many of those we have recently been acºustomed
to. By the way, we wonder that anything has been said about the
necessity for an invasion at all, when the French would have nothing to
do—according to some wise authorities—but to fire into us by means of
the submarine telegraph, and inflict upon us a terrific charge from the
werful galvanic battery that might be opened upon our coast from
ape Grisnez.
Now that probabilities are by universal consent thrown overboard,
and everybody seems to be talking or writing as much nonsense as he
can on the subject of invasion, we merely follow the fashion in
suggesting a few extravagant absurdities, with a view to the thorough
raising of that noble but rather peaceful old animal—the British Lion.
A MILITARY SELL.
OUR attention has been lately called to a not very valorous practice
which has been commenced, but which we do not expect will be much
followed, among the officers of the British army. e allude to the
fact of there having been some instances of selling out at a moment
when there is a possibility that the Guards might be required for the
use of the country as well as for its ornament. We beg to protest
inst being misunderstood, or misinterpreted, and we therefore say
distinctly, that the selling out will, in our opinion, furnish a very insig-
nificant exception to the general rule, by which the officers of the army
will be guided; and that they will nearly all stand to their posts like
men of honour and courage, all the more firmly because they believe
their services may be required. If the Guards were all dandies—which
they are not, -and, if they were, a dandy is after all a very good-
natured fellow in nine cases out of ten—they are nearly all Gentlemen.
The rumour of war will only have the good effect of winnowing
away, by its breath, the few grains of mere chaff to be found amid the
solid stuff which will resist to the last the stoutest attempts to
administer a thrashing.
There have, however, been some rare instances of selling out, and
º in some cases circumstances, with which we are unacquainted,
may have justified the act, we shall take the liberty of making a cap—
out of a sheet, of paper—which, without our meaning to fix it on any
Marticular head, ºft no doubt be found to fit somebody, who is at full
iberty to appropriate it, and wear it.
Curious Chemical Discovery.
AN eminent Chemist of our acquaintance has, by the aid of a
highly powerful Chemico-Mesmeric Analysing Apparatus of his
invention, lately succeeded in analysing what he terms the “vital
circulating medium ” of the present i. – that is, President of
France; and finds it to consist almost wholly of sang froid, without a
particle of sang pur about it.

“DEAR PUNCH,
“”TIs an ill wind that blows nobody good; and the blast that

my commission would be seriously diminished. Whatever injury he
may have done other people, the French, Dictator will have greatly

ALARMING ILLNESS OF TWO EMINENT LEGAL
CHARACTERS.
ALL who have any reverence for time-honoured names in connection
with our venerable system of English law, will learn, with regret, that
two celebrated personages, who have long figured in professional anta-
gonism in the Courts of Nisi Prius, have been attacked with symptoms
giving occasion for the most serious apprehension on the part of their
friends. A conviction has gained ground that their services, of late,
have tended rather to the complication and delay of proceedings, than
otherwise, in the causes wherein they have been en ; and the
general opinion seems to be, that they have outlived their usefulness.
The Common Law Commissioners have, accordingly, felt it their duty
to recommend that these distinguished characters should in future
cease to be retained; and hence it is inferred that their existence can
hardly be protracted, for a lengthened period. . When they shall have
left us, it will be said, by many a lover of old forms, that “there hath
passed away a glory from "actions of ejectment; and the skirt of many
a long robe will wipe away the tear shed in memory of those cham-
pions so renowned in the annals of legal fiction—“John DoE’ and
“RICHARD Roe.”

POST-OFFICE REFORM.
[From our own Cabinet Correspondent.]
We are enabled, we hope, on the very best authority, to lay before
the British Empire the most gratifying intelligence illustrative of the
new and enlightened determination of the British Cabinet. It has too
long been the reproach of the Ministry, that the bigger fishes and the
whiter loaves have ever been bestowed upon the born aristocracy, the
plebeian projectors being set aside, or at best rewarded with the smallest
of sprats, and the coarsest of penny rolls. All this is to be reformed.
Hence, the MARquess of CLANRicarde, who withdraws from the office
of Postmaster General, is to be superseded by Row1AND HILL.
For once in a way, the vulgar working-bee is to have his due reward,
vice the dignified drone.

OUR readers will be delighted to hear that England has made a naval
demonstration in the very face of the French President. At the ball

Louis Napoleon's Celebrated Campaign.
THERE is a talk of the military promotion of Louis NAPOLEoN.
The mere rank of Lieutenant-Colonel of the National Guards, is not
enough for the nephew of an Emperor, who may be Emperor himself
one of these lugubrious days. He is to be made Connétable de l'Empire.
If this be true—and nothing is unlikely, now-a-days, in France—then
we mean to say Louis Napoleon has fairly won his baton de Con-
nétable—in other words, his Constable's Staff, which he handled with
such dexterity on the memorable 10th of April, 1848,

uired to be laid

collar is already
- in the wash, and
the stockings of the state footmen have been lying in pink saucers
since Monday last. It is expected that their legs will be more
rosy, than ever on the 3rd of February; and the person entrusted with
“getting up” the stockings has been instructed to select a pink as
near to the well-known “pink of perfection” as possible. The “Cap
of Maintenance”, has been taken out of its hat-box, and thoroughly
brushed after its long map; and the Usher of the Black Rod has given
out his wand of office to be black leaded for the occasion that is just
at hand. The manes and tails of the state horses are already put up
in curl-papers, and the air-cushions of the state carriage are being tho-
º aired, so that the ceremony is likely to be quite as imposing
as usual.

SHOE-BLACKS IN PARLIAMENT.
THE Athenæum has a pleasant social and statistic notice of the
young shoe-blacks who have succeeded in London streets; by which it
appears that Kossuth was, indirectly, productive to them on his visit
to the City, when
“People trod unanimously on each others' toes, and the industrial little colony
earned a large sum of money.”
. Seeing that, in the present session of Parliament, certain parties are
liable to have their toes “unanimously trod upon,” a few of the black-
ing brigade º be serviceable, in the House of Commons. Nay

RIFLE CLUBS.
A very laudable feeling is glowing in the hearts of thousands of the
British people—the feeling for rifle practice. ...The British people have
the best wishes, the most disinterested aspirations, for the F. of
the people of France; nevertheless, if French soldiers are ordered to
attempt to jump upon the British beach, British people-deeply regret-
ting the occasion—are desirous to have the readiest means, of killing
them. We wish France well; but, with the present Notability at the
Tuileries, we can only wish her well, with our º at full-cock.
We hate war; nevertheless, we have a worse hatred of slavery. We
do not think it a pleasant, humanising object to contemplate a soldier
gashed by sword, or riddled by bullet, stark and dead on the English
strand: for all that, we would rather look upon him in that dilemm
“taking his rest,” with the sky for a coverlet, than have him alive an
kicking in our conquered streets. . We hate martial instruments; but
we are free to confess it—we would rather be compelled to give afore-
said French soldier three inches of cold iron than half-an-inch of
hearth-rug. Bayonets are very bad, but chains are worse than
bayonets. -
t is this just and elevating feeling of self-defence—and no vain cock-
a doodle-doo-ing—that has stimulated so many persons, the youthful and
the mature, to become desirous of shouldering and cracking rifles.
From no hatred of France, but from hatred and distrust of the man
who dominates France, paralysed as she is under military nightmare,
Rifle Clubs are being formed throughout England; and, º: We
lament the necessity, we rejoice at the manly spirit that—as although
it were a sanative balsam-snuffs gunpowder.
The utility, otherwise the necessity, of Rifle Clubs being admitted, we
have to suggest to the various bodies of riflemen, that they adopt various
kinds of targets; so that, whilst the aim of the marksman is educated,
there is also conveyed a moral lesson. May there not be sentiment in a
bull’s eye? Let us, in one or two examples, consider the matter.
As every regiment has its flag, why should not every civil rifle corps
have its peculiar target? Already, a gallant young stock-broker has
called upon recruits; and no doubt from his own class will be gathered
an efficient body. Where their practising-ground will be, we know not
—but we heartily trust not in Capel Court. The place, however, is not
the matter; but the particular target. What, then, better than the
ºrg: green grasshopper in a round of gold-the GRESHAM
crest? Sine sanguine, sine dolore, poetically clicks the grasshopper.
“Without blood, and without rief.” is the very motto for our pacific
marksmen, who only learn to shoot the better, that they may the better
keep the peace. A spot of gold—no bigger than a sovereign on the
grasshopper—might serve as the mark. Is there not in such target-
practice a double lesson conveyed? At once a sure eye for an aim, and
a sharp look-out for a º P
Why, too, should we not have an Income-Tax Rifle Corps ? The
target with the 7d. in the centre; the nominal bull’s eye the middle
of the circle of the d.f. Surely, Joseph HUME might raise many hun-
dreds of marksmen; and, possibly, for old political acquaintance-sake,
LoRD John would permit him to set up his butt in Palace-Yard.
As for the lawyers—and they did practise in the last panic—they too
have already spoken from the Temple. They are, to a man, prepared
for rifle practice; and, unlike our soldiers of the line, have coats of a
colour that would deceive even a Kafir. Very difficult is it to hit a
lawyer. But for the legal target. Well, we propose a perfectly spun
cobweb, with a Spider in the centre. This target would afford a pecu-
liar, opportunity whereby to test the sharpness of the shooters; the
spider's lines depicting such nicety of distance, even for those who
jä miss the spider itself.
With these few motions, we leave the subject to be variously worked
out by the various Clubs. e have made the general suggestion; its
particular application rests with particular bodies.

the President was most graciously pleased to put upon his late so-
called “Election” by seven and a half millions of a hal votes.

ALPHABET LOZENGES.
SoMEBody has started, what may be called,
with reference, to the Alphabet, a
cAPITAL idea, by proposing to teach
children their letters through the me-
dium of Lozenges. Instead of appeal-
ing to the eye, the inventor appeals to
the mouth, and thus the sweets of
learning are made—not simply a name,
but a luscious reality. In these days,
when premature cram-
ming is so common, it
is something to invent
a plan for causing in-
struction to go down
agreeably. A thirst for
knowledge is an ex-
cellent thing, but the
Alphabet Lozenges will
encourage not only an
absolute hunger, but a
| right-down greediness, #
for learning. Some may
doubt the propriety of
blending instructionwith
the lollipop, and allowing
the influence of the cane
to be superseded by that
of the sugar-stick. We
think that a wholesome
effect might be produced
- - - - by conveying informa-
tion in a medical form, and we throw out the hint, for combining salubrity with science, by
the invention of a ºl. pill, a geographical black dose, and an ointment to be rubbed
in for the purpose of rubbing up a knowledge of history.
THE GREAT REFRESHMENT DEBATE.
(From our own Reporter.)
The first business of the Session, after the “Ministerial Explanations,” was a debate on
the prices and qualities of the provisions to be had in the Refreshment Room of the House
of Commons. We wish Honourable Members would be as solicitous about that which comes
out of their mouths, as they seem to be anxious about what is to go into them. Though
the debate on the Chop and Steak, question included nearly every kind of provisions, there
was nothing said about the probable expense of eating their own words—an operation to
which many Members will, in the course of the Session, be liable. It is certainly rather a
cool proceeding on the part of the Commons, when they ought to be inquiring anxiously into
the condition of our Ports, to be asking questions about the price and quality of their own
Sherries. When the whole nation is full of anxiety about the Cape, it is rather disappointing
to find the House absorbed in the lºg. of its own Madeira. We shall expect to find the
notice-book occupied with Motions for a Select Committee to inquire—not whether the Caffres
have raised the standard of revolt, but whether the Wine-merchant has raised the price per
bottle of the Standard of Natural Sherry, -
Since the precedent has been set, we may expect to have it extensively followed; and we
shall be having Motions to § {i. to the bar of the House, for having served out
indifferent grog to an Honourable Member at the bar of the coffee-room. Agricultural
Members will be asking questions relative to their chop in town, neglectful of their stake
in the country; and Returns will be moved for, to ascertain the number of cooks employed in
making the broth, with a view to the punishment of those who may have had a hand in spoiling
it. The CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchequER will, perhaps, be called upon to relieve from duty,
cigars smoked by Members; and the Economist party will probably move for the introduction
of the “small plate” system, as adopted, with much success, in the cheap eating-houses of
the metropolis. On the whole, we cannot congratulate the Commons on their second night's
debate; for their hunger for chops contrasted discreditably with the national thirst for
information on subjects of larger interest.
Political and Social Prospects.
PARLIAMENT re-assembles, and the season returns. The consequence will be, that parties
will pursue their old courses, both in the House and out of it; there will be the usual
intrigues: and very late hours will be kept almost every night, with very doubtful benefit
to the constitution.
Perhaps So.
OUR Social Reporter informs us, that, from statistics of his own collecting, he is now
prepared to show that the quantity of quadrille parties last New Year's Eve was fully 20
per cent. above the average. We suppose this increase, is mainly attributable to the fact,
that people thought it appropriate to begin Leap Year with a Hop.
EPITOME OF ORDNANCE MANAGEMENT.-All their pieces are farces.
THE PREMIER'S GREAT-GRAND.
MOTHER.
Those who are always on the look-out to find
some family connection between the members of
the Government, and who think that office is
bestowed less upon abstract than on relative
merit, have discovered that LoRD John Russell's
great-grandmother was the sister of Lord GRAN-
VILLE's great-grandfather. We can agree with
the Premier in laughing at the idea of his pre-
dilection for relations so very distant, in point of
time, as his own great-grandmother and some-
body else's great-grandfather. We do not
accuse the Minister of having chosen his Forei
Secretary on account of the possibility that the
great-grandfather of the one may have taught the
great-grandmother of the other to suck eggs, or
that there may have been some other little in-
terchange of brotherly and sisterly attentions
etween a pair, who have been, more than a cen-
tury back, gathered to a previous batch of still
reater grandfathers and grandmothers. These
imputations are, however, the result of a long:
established character for nepotism, and we should
not be surprised if Lord John were to be taken
to task for bestowing a place on the merest
stranger, and charged with doing so for family
reasons, simply because the person promoted
falls under the denomination of “a man and a
brother.”

THE “HYGELAN” SYSTEM OF POLITICS.
We have been considerably amused of iate by observing that the
system of politics now dominant in Europe, conforms with marvellous
| regularity to the “Hygeian or Morisonian System” in medicine. The
principles of this last, as contained in a hand-bill which recently fell
into our hands, in an omnibus, are embodied in a series of “propositions,”
which we extract from, to prove our view:—
1. The vital principle is in the Blood.
2. Everything in the body is derived from the Blood.
3. All Constitutions are radically the same. -
4. All diseases arise from impurity of the Blood, or, in other words,
acrimonious humours lodged in the body.
Really, the analogy (though we speak with mºdesty of the results of
our acuteness of remark) is quite wonderful. The “vital principle” of
the dynasties of Hapsburg, &c., is clearly the Blood; so is that of the
government of our friend the French President. Then, as for the body
politic—it derives its “everything,” which is little enough, from this
sanguinary source; everything, we say—from the Blood—for who sup-
poses that it can derive anything from the-brains? All “Constitu-
tions,” again, are radically in the same predicament; the “Blood”
lords it over them; and even the sturdy Constitution of our dear joms
| Bull has of late been disturbed by a tendency of the “Blood” tº the
nead-of affairs. And, as for the last of these dicta, it is impossible to
deny that “acrimonious humours”—very bad humours indeed—prevail
in the body politic, everywhere, to a very great extent.
When we turn to the remedy which the genius of MoR1son suggests.
we find that a “Vegetable Compound” was the real desideratum; and,
that this MoRIson discovered. We only wish we knew a vegetable com-
pound which would cure the disorders of Europe. The “President,”
indeed, favoured his body politic with a prescription of the vegetable
called grape, some time ago, but the ill-humours have only been going
on increasing ever since. The Protectionists, we suppose, could suggest
turnips—thoroughly protected from competition. But though all kinds
of green things i. been abundant of late, in the treatment of affairs,
the “requisite energy” has not yet been imputed to the “Blood,” which,
we are afraid, still causes disease by the impure state in which it is...
Meanwhile Punch does his duty, as of old, by his external application
of the vegetable birch,-which may, possibly, stimulate the “Blood,”
and, by promoting activity, improve the “Body.”

OUR ADMIRAL ON HALF-PAY.
DMIRAL BENBow HAzY
is now living in retire-
ment, or, to adopt the
more usual expression,
is reposing on his
laurels. A little while
ago his neighbours of
the town of Biddle-
cumb gave him a pub-
lic dinner. The Admi-
ral is much respected
in his own district,
where his family is
well known. The
HAZYs are supposed
(by themselves) to
have come over with
the Conqueror, , and
have certainly held the
lands of Hazyton for
some generations.
J - The Admiral's pre-
sent object is to ac-
uire the command of
- the Channel fleet,
which, we believe, may be obtained in three ways—by living to 120;
by Parliamentary agitation; or by marrying into the Ministry. Our
friend HAZY is open to either of these courses, though it still remains
a question whether either of them is open to him... Meanwhile, he
is devoting himself to Polite letters. He meditates, we believe,
nothing more nor less than
A NIEW DIBIDIN.
There is a certain calm grandeur about this proposal, which we are
aware will startle the British tar. DIBDIN, we know, is the singer
ºf the ºld school; but shall the new school have no singer? A
“class has arisen,” says SIR CHARLEs NAPIER, the Admiral, in his
...} un-complaining way, “which sneers at what they call the old
school.”
The fact is, we believe that gentlemen of the school of Hazy won't eat
"junk” when they can get boiled fowl. This is one symptom of the
deadly change which HAZY's contemporary, SIR CHARLEs, bewails; and
which HAzy proposes to chronicle in literature, and particularly in
song, by adapting DIBDIN's well-known chants to the changed state of
circumstances.
But our friend HAZY's object is also highly utilitarian. He intends
to decorate the odd little ship-building freaks and other graceful fan-
tasies of the Admiralty with poetic grace. Luckily for him, he is on
half-pay at present, and free to exert himself in this manner. Our readers
are possibly not aware that an Admiralty Regulation—so the gallant
officer assures us—forbids all officers on service to write on naval
matters in periodicals. For, as they are just the fit people to write—
why, of course, the subject would be instructively handled—and what
would become of the Service then?
The first specimen which the Admiral has sent us of his performance,
belongs to the first of the above-mentioned classes. It is intended to
be sung—with deference to SIR CHARLEs NAPIER—by the New School,
“If ever the sun of Great Britain sets,” was the beautiful sentiment of
a Captain whom we knew, “it will set in an ocean of Madeira!”. He
was alluding to the increasing luxury of the midshipmen of the
Timbuctoo, which he then commanded. He subsequently, by-the-bye,
perished on the coast of Africa from a surfeit of tripe, a martyr to his
rinitive tastes. There is a monument to him-(“Hope comforting a
egro.” By Higson.)—in the churchyard at Sierra Leone. But this
is a digression. HAzy's first song, we say, is founded on DIBDIN's
well-known “Nothing like Grog.” But how different the object of this
fine-minded writer | His song is as follows:–
NOTHING LIKE HOCK.
A plague of those musty old lubbers
§. said that a mid must not think;
That a gun-room was no place for “rubbers,”
And “grog" was the right thing to drink!
JohannisherG ! could they have twigg'd it,
How their vulgar ideas 't would mock!
And, spite of their rules,
The old fools
Would surely, one fancies, have swigg'd it,
And sworn their was nothing like Hock!
My father, when I gave a guinea
#. a bouquet tº. B—,
Said, “JACK, never be such a ninny;
You’ll ruin your mother and me.”
I pass'd round the sunny Rudesheimer,
And bow'd to that worthy old cock:
He was sulky—and mother,
And sister, and brother.
I humm'd from an opera ;
And swore there was nothing like Hock!
T’ other day as my uncle was preaching,
From the family pew out I slunk—
The Dean is a good hand at º;
But the previous night I’d been drunk;—
So I bolted for soda; out-pour’d it
With some wine for the foundation rock.
It was grand it was glorious !
Fresh, foaming, victorious!
And I worshipp'd the Rhine as I floor'd it,
And swore there was nothing like Hock!
Then trust me, if you must be drinking,
Let the grape line the way to the grave;
Rum-and-water—at least to my #:
Is coarse as the salt of the wave:
As for me, wine’s my one only tipple-
—I am just going off to the dock–
Seedy, well, late or early,
To set you up, fairly—
At sea with a bore,
Or at leisure on shore,
'Pon my honour, there’s nothing like Hock!
MODEL ARTICLE ON A CERTAIN PERSON.
(Dedicated to the Parliamentary Censors of the Press.)
We should be sorry to express any strong opinion on
the acts of the PRESIDENT of the French nation.
It is a constitutional maxim, that the QUEEN
can do no wrong: and we would willingly ascribe
the same impeccability to the elect of seven
millions of Frenchmen. We are, therefore, in-
clined to doubt the statements, that he occa-
sioned his soldiery to shoot several hundred
French citizens at the windows and in the streets
of Paris; that he caused numerous officers and
other persons of distinction to be illegally seized,
imprisoned, and banished, or that he has de-
ported, to Cayenne and elsewhere, some thousand
persons, without a conviction, without a trial,
without a crime. We question whether he has
enslaved the press, andwº. the expres-
sion of public opinion: We are sceptical as to
the allegation that he has decreed any such
measure as the confiscation of the QRLEANs pro-
perty. But, even if he has done all these things,
we should not be disposed hastily to censure
him. If charity begins at home, it extends to
a foreign nation; and it requires us to place the
best construction we can on the motives of the
man who was a special constable on the 10th
of April. Frenchmen are not Englishmen, and
though they certainly ought not on that account
to be butchered without good reason, yet there
is a difference between the two nations, which
in one may reduce to a dire necessity what in
the other would be a dreadful crime.
Circumstances alter cases; and these observa-
tions will apply equally to the other proceedings imputed, whether
correctly, or incorrectly, to Louis NAFOLEON., The consideration of
them will remove much that appears objectionable in the policy which
he is said to have adopted, if he has adopted it: which, as we before
remarked, we doubt. What seems the most probable of all the allega-
tions made against him, is, that he has destroyed the liberty, of the
Press: as most of the Parisian Journals are, in fact, silent; but we
can understand and appreciate the motive which may restrain, them
from prematurely pronouncing on matters which had better be left to
the judgment of the historian. And, for our own part, we should hesi-
tate to say anything that might provoke a powerful enemy: not that
the illustrious PRINCE, to whom we allude, is in the slightest degree
irritable or vindictive.

HER DUCKS HOME.
PROTECTIONIST UNITY OF THOUGHT.
THERE are said to be just now three oppositions; but, though there
may be a difference of opinion on the Anti-Ministerial benches, there is
a remarkable unanimity of idea; for the two leaders—the EARL OF
DERBY in the Lords, and MR. DisrAELI in the Commons—were found
making use of exactly the same figure in almost precisely the same
words. Both commented on the QUEEN’s Speech, and both suggested
that one of its fifteen Fº was the production of one of the
fifteen members of the Cabinet. Considering that this was almost the
only “point” in the speech of the Protectionist, peer, as well as in
that of the Protectionist commoner, the question will be, whether
two great men hit º on the same thought; or whether
one took it from the other; and if so, which is the original, and which
the copyist. The matter may perhaps give rise to a controversy similar
to that regarding the respective claims of ADAMs and LE WERRIER to
one of the recently discovered comets.
The friends of the peer will stick up for the priority of his Lordship,
and will attribute to the Earl the early notion; while, on the other
hand, the admirers of MR. DISRAELI may perhaps assert that he had
the idea cut and dried in his desk for nearly twenty-four hours before
the speech was actually delivered. It will be impossible to decide on
such a very delicate question; but we can, at all events, have no hesi;
tation in allowing that it looks as if the Protectionist opposition had
been * on the opening night of the Session by one—and exactly
One-ldea,
The Sibthorp Parade.
CoLonEL SIBTHORP boasts that he was, never inside the Crystal
Palace, and still wants it pulled down. Will no consideration induce
him to spare that wonderful building?. He could at once preserve an
ornament to the Metropolis, and obtain a great personal triumph, by
p. the House of Commons to keep up the Temple of Peace—
§ the purpose, in wet weather, of drilling soldiers in it for national
eience.
A Colour ABLE Excuse.--THE reluctance shown by, many military
men to abandon the red uniform, arises from a natural disinclination
they feel to deserting their colours.
THE GRAND EXPLANATION.
THE PREMIER.
NormanBY said, TURGot said WALEwski said he said—
I mean the noble Lord said—more than we said;
So l said, did he say what certainly he said—as they said?
Then he to what I said, after some three or four days' delay, said,
That as to what I said they said he said, he had said so and so;
Whereupon I said, that after what he said we couldn’t get on ; and he
had better go.
The Ex-Foreign SecretaRy.
With regard to what I said; at least, ...; to what they have said
To my noble—friend—as he said—'tis possible I may have said
Something of that nature, perhaps, I in reply said,
As soon as I had time; but they had not said quite what I said.
Besides, 1 said, what I said, as aforesaid,
He said as well, and they said, and many more said;
And what I said, as he said, and they said, I had a right to say, if l
cinose.
And, after all's said and done, it is I who have kept you from blows.
LORD BROUGHAM'S OPTICAL LECTURE.
His Lordship, during his brief sojourn in Paris, on his way from
Cannes to London, where he arrives—Punch is happy to say—full of
southern sunlight, gave a lecture upon Optics, to the delight and
admiration of the French Academy. After all, we may say of
BROUGHAM as PEEL said of PALMERSton—“we are all proud of him.”
Nevertheless, his Lordship's sense of fun—not that Punch complains of
it; no, no! he leaves that to the over-grave and consequently over-foolish
—will get the better of the scientific legislator. It was very proper
that LoRD BRough AM should give his lecture on Optics; but why—why,
at such a time, did he propose to give—what, he called “the greatest
Optical Illusion that, ever visited a nation?”—and then, followed up
his promise by producing a phantasm of Louis NAPoleon in the
cocked hat, redingote, and boots of his uncle? We ought to feel at once
happy and lucky that our own BROUGHAM is safe in London, and not
on his way to Cayenne.

A Cabinet Picture.
We always looked ". LoRD PALMERSTON as a great politician;
but we learned for the first time, on the opening night of the Session,
that he is also a great artist. We glean this fact from his announce-
ment to the House, that he would not trouble it with the letter he
wrote to LoRD. John Russell, “nor with the illustration the letter
contained.” We can only imagine that, as the tone of the letter was
rather severe, the “illustration” must have been satirical; and that
loRD PALMERston sent the Premier a “large cut,” as well as a
tremendous dig.
A WERY MILD COMPLAINT.
THE EARL of DERBy complained of the disorderly arrangement of
topics in the QUEEN's Speech. If the noble Earl's party had succeeded
in their struggle to perpetuate the starvation laws, the disorder might
have been, not in the Speech, but in the country.
A MoRBID APPETITE.-May it...not be maintained that a vegetarian
who eats gooseberry fool is a cannibal P
THE FIRST COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY.
NE of the first debates of the
Session — as reported—
has been a discussion on
culinary economy – the
affairs of the Kitchen and
Refreshment-rooms — in
short, provisional arrange-
ments. We are glad to
observe — however ill it
may augur for Protec-
tionistprospects—that the
| House is resolved to per-
sist in the policy of cheap
4:3 food. MR. FRENch, in
- reference to the present
º victualling establishment, objected to sherry at 6s. a
ottle; and so do we, at least when we have to pay for it ourselves;
and the wine is, like that deprecated by the honourable Member
for Roscommon, not worth half that sum. MR. Chisholm ANSTEY
enlivened the debate by proposing that a Roman Catholic should be
placed on the Committee appointed to direct the comestible.business
of the House — naming SERGEANT MURPHY: who would be a safe
man, and is not, by all accounts, however orthodox, the sort of
Roman Catholic who would want roast bishop as well as roast beef.
LoRI, M. HILL also amused the House with a recitation of the bill
of existing charges, which he argued were reasonable; saying, that a
portion of soup was charged 1s., mutton broth and a chop likewise 18.;
a statement which occasioned “laughter,” as if Hon. Gentlemen
thought such prices were ridiculously small... If the “portion of soup.”
of the parliamentary carte is equivalent to the one ox, or one mock, of
the .#. restaurant, one shilling, even with a penny extra for the
waiter, can hardly be considered an exorbitant cost, supposing the ox
to be the honest tail, and the mock a decent imitation. The º of
fish, according to the noble Lord, was quite as cheap, as he proved by
going into particulars; but though he ſº the figure of soles, whiting,
mackerel, turbot, codfish, and salmon, he omitted to say how much was
asked for a plaice.
That nearly the first discussion in the House of Commons should
have related to eating and drinking, promises well. It looks sensible.
At any rate, we may hope to have no quarrelling between “the Belly
and the Members.”
A FAIR TAX ON KNOWLEDGE.
THEY manage some things better in Prussia, as well as in France
than they do here. The Prussian Government has imposed on politi
periodicals a stamp-duty of half a pfenning for every 100 square inches
of superficial contents. - - -
It is not for us to boast. We are not going to brag of our superiority
to other journals. But if English political periodicals were charged
with stamp-duty according to their superficial contents, we can only sa
that we do not know which would have the better reason to be satisfied,
the Government or Punch.
A Startling Free Trade Question.
THE Morning Herald asks—
“Shall we hand over our noble West Indian colonies to the rattlesnake and the
naked negro?”
We think not. We are convinced that England will commit no such
act of injustice. Or if the rattlesnake and the naked negro are, hence-
forth, to be the sole proprietors of the soil, confident we are, that
England will make due compensation to the scorpions and mosquitoes.
A DRY FACT.
THE Protectionists complain very bitterly of the drain upon the land.
But practical agriculturists are always telling us, that a thorough
draining is what the land most requires.
Theatrical Intelligence.
WE understand that two new pieces at the Lyceum Theatre have
just been suppressed by, our ever-vigilant censor, in consequence of
their sarcastic titular allusion to the position and prospects of the
Prince President of France. The pieces in question are called The
Prince of Happy Land and The Game of Speculation.

Opposition to Law Reform has proceeded, and is likely to proceed,
from a quarter where it had not been anticipated. A well-known and
hitherto highly respected Usher in Westminster Hall has, we under-
stand, determined on presenting a petition against what is threatened
to be done for the purpose of “abolishing unnecessary forms in the
Qourts at Westminster.”. The position he will take, is this—that no
forms call safely be abolished, inasmuch as there is not one unnecessary
form in Westminster Hall, and that the public very often monopolise

WHERE
IS THE STAGE GOING TO p
By A DISAPPOINTED DRAMAtist.
E think we have a
perfect, right to
put the above
same right to an-
swer it.
One of the
causes of the de-
cline of the Dra-
ma (mind, we only
say one) is the de-
cline of actors. No
one will deny that if our
actors were better—
and, with three or four
honourable exceptions,
they couldn't well be
worse — the English
Stage would be in a
far better position.
This want is about
to be supplied. Chil-
dren and Marionnettes
are the sources from
which the supply will
come.
The Bateman Children have made many, a big actor look small by the side
of them. They seem to understand what they act; and, moreover, to enjoy it.
| Theirs is not a mere dry mechanical task, as you might expect from children,
but a hearty enjoyment—a pastime which, you imagine, they would cry, if
deprived of. It is literally “playing” with them. They romp about the stage
as naturally as if they were in a Nursery; and, if a Nursery of Actors is ever
founded for the British Stage, the Bateman Children ought to be the head of it.
The fact is, the majority of our actors º: to be sent to school again—
and stop there for ten years—and then come back to the stage when they have
learnt what acting is.
From Intelligence to Wood is no such violent transition on the stage. So
question, and the
accordingly, we jump, without any apology for so violent a
* from the Batemºn &iſiºn to theirionnette.
ut the Marionnettes are not merely wood. It is true that
| their heads are wood—and so the same may be said of mostly
all the heads of our Drama at the present moment. All their
actors are wooden, excessively wooden—as wooden and as
| stiff as the old defunct Telegraph that used to tumble about,
and perform extraordinary somersaults à la WIELAND, in St.
James's Park. And in this, we are pained to admit, lies the
great fault of the Marionnettes' performance. After all, there
is no great novelty in them. It is precisely what we have
been accustomed to for years on the English stage.
There is one great charm in the acting of these little dolls—
there is no “gagging,” which is, in our case, a most hea-
thenish practice, only done to propitiate “the gods,”—and a
process which those actors who indulge in it, always deserve
to have º to their own mouths, to prevent them from
doing it for the future. The consequence is you hear the
author's words, and not the actor's, and the difference is, as
might be expected, a wonderful improvement. We do not
know who the authors may be, but they have every reason to
be grateful to their interpreters. - -
In short, not to be fulsome in our praise, these little Marion-
nettes realise Hamlet’s “Advice to the Players” more than
many actors we have yet seen. -
They speak every speech as the authors pronounced it to
them, trippingly on the tongue; and they do not mouth
them as many of our players do. . Nor do they saw the
air too much with their hands; but use everything gently,
And in the torrent, tempest, and (as we may say) whirlwind
of their passion, they have acquired and begot a very great
“temperance;” for, though we went behind the scenes, we
did not observe a single glass of brandy-and-water.
In short, not to “speak profanely,” these wooden players
have the accents of Christians, if not exactly the gait of
Christians; for it must be confessed they have scarcely ac-
quired a sound footing upon the English łº as yet—and
though “nature's journeymen (and carpenters) have made the
men” and women, still they have made them so well, that
they imitate humanity, as it is generally represented on the
stage, anything but abominably.

To praise any one actor where all are so excellent, would be invidious,
(we think we have met with this line in theatrical criticisms before)
—but, on some future occasion we intend to pay a little more attention
to the peculiar style of each puppet, and to use our thunderbolt, or
butterboat, accordingly.
As we were behind the scenes, we peeped into the green-room. All
was quiet, perfect harmony, and good-nature. There was no jealousy,
no black looks, no heart-burnings, or bickerings, or the slightest quar-
relling going on. There was a holy silence that spoke (for silence speaks
louder sometimes than any speaking-trumpet) of peace within. The
little puppets were strewed about the floor, and looked as gentle and
as loving as the Babes in the Wood.
We do not know whether we have satisfactorily answered the
question of “Where is the º: going to?” but it might go to many
worse places than the Lowt

WHAT THE DEBATES WILL COME TO.
IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.-HOUSE OF COMMONS.
ORDER OF THE DAY.
ONMR. MoRGAN presenting a petition from the electors of Mon-
mouthshire for a bill to secure a knowledge of the Welsh language on
the part of clergymen appointed to livings in Wales,
LoRD John Russell, observed, that there were worse things than
a Welsh rabbit. His Lordship then moved the order of the day.
SIR. JAMES, GRAHAM had a high opinion of Welsh mutton; he also
thought a Welsh trout a capital fish.
Mr. DiskAELI considered that the Right Honourable Baronet was
wrong (laughter) in beginning with mutton and then taking fish. Soup,
indeed, always came first-at least in the party which he had the
honour to be connected with (cheers).
MR. BRight said, the policy of the Honourable Member for Bucks
would reduce the population at large to the level of applicants at a soup
kilchen. (Order! and Question!)
MR. Chishop MANstey would ask a question of Government. Did
they approve of red herrings? (Hear, from the Irish Members.) If so,
all he could say was, he had asked the SERGEANT-At-ARMs if there were
bloaters, and there were none.
THE CHANCELLoR of the Exchequer was free to confess (hear,
from MR. REYNolps) that HER Majesty's Ministers had no objection
whatever to a good red ". for breakfast (hear). But if it were
proposed to dine off the same dish (hear, hear), he was not prepared º
say that the Cabinet could consent to that proposition. o, oh! from
MR. Keogh.)
MR. Cobden, had just had a cut off an aitch-bone of beef. It was
not quite so well done as he could wish.
SIR. C. KNIGHTLey preferred beef rather underdone.
MR. HuME said a shoulder of mutton and onion sauce was not a bad
thing. You ought to have mealy potatoes.
An interesting conversation of some length then took place, on the
comparative merits of snipe and woodcock; after which,
Lord John Russell, in reply to a question from MR. Roebuck,
acknowledged that he looked confidently forward to the enjoyment of
the usual whitebait dinner at Greenwich, on the conclusion of the
a House of Commons; he might say a Diet.

SIR. Robert INGL1s said there was an observation which, perhaps,
he should have made just now, when they were º: of beef. After
a good roast sirloin, he would recommend a glass of old, well-seasoned,
and, at the same time, full-bodied, port wine. (Hear, hear.)
Colon EL SIBThorp was as fond of good living as anybody. He
could also digest anything—except the measures of Government. He
had the stomach of a horse. (No, no!) Parties in that house seemed
to be resolving themselves into a dinner party. The house was, indeed,

The
THE OLD HOUSE AND THE NEW.
(BY AN ELDERLY M.P.)
OH, the Old House it was simple, and some might call it bare;
| All unadorn’d its benches, and plain its Speaker's chair;
There was no gilding on the roof, and on the honest panes
No Dragons Green, or Lions Red, flaunted their tails and manes.
Oh, cosey were its 5. where worn-out public men
Could take their well earn'd forty winks out of the Speaker's ken;
And snug, too, were those benches each side the Speaker’s door,
When some long-winded Member had possession of the floor.
Its ventilation REID had brought at last to such a state,
That the temperature was pleasant—in the heat, too, of debate;
One's head was cool, one's toes were warm, one knew noroasts nor chills;
And the only draughts one suffered from, were sometimes drafts of Bills.
Upon acoustic principles the roof might not be plann'd,
But still one heard what Members said, wherever they might stand:
In short, though art and architects at our Old House might sneeze,
One heard, saw, slept, lounged, listen’d in’t, talk'd, sat, or stood at ease.
But BARRY came, and prosed and plann'd, and the New House arose
Leisurely—to the tune of “That’s the way the money goes,”
All beflower'd with Tudor roses and portcullises, by scores,
With painting on the windows and gilding on the doors.
Nought could be statelier than the roof, or richer than the walls,
The poppy-heads upon the seats would have graced Cathedral stalls.
The monsters that athwart the panes displayed their colours rare,
Were right Rouge Dragons to a scale, true Blue Lions to a hair.
There was not an inch of surface where an ornament would stick,
But there you had the ornament, laid on, as thick as thick.
The Mediaeval lettering was so extremely fine,
None but a Record-office clerk could read a single line.
In short, this grand New House of ours, to take it on the view,
Is what the late GeoRGE Robins would have called “quite a bijou,”
And if, on trial, it be found to have its slight defect—
What odds that it's not comfortable? One knows that it's correct.
'Tis true that finish’d in two years the House was to have been:
Whereas it has been now in hand somewhere about sixteen:
'Twas to cost less than a million, we were told; whereas, 'tis true,
We shall be extremely lucky if we get off for two.
In a room meant for debating, some, no doubt, might have preferr'd
That the roof should have been pitched, so that the speakers could be
heard;
But, when one thinks how sadly the style this might have marr'd,
One feels that to insist on't would have been extremely hard.
Unreasonable Members declare it makes them ill
To be kept sitting in a draught, enough to turn a mill:
Of course, they wouldn't say so, if they would just reflect,
Doors must be hung, and archways pierced, not for comfort, but effect.
Some will complain of nasty smells, and some of leaking lamps,
Some of alternate heats and chills, engend'ring aches and cramps;
Some will contrast the Old House with the New one, just as though
They didn't see that that was built for use, and this for show.
INFORMATION For THE BUILDER.—It is said to be a fact that some
of the Heads of Houses at Oxford and Cambridge are thatched.

THE CONSTITUTIONAL WHIP.
To the EMPEROR of Austria.
SIRE,
. YoUR MAJESTY pays me a very high compliment in applying to
me for information. I have the honour to state, that there is attached
to the British Cabinet such a functionary as that one about whom your
MAJESTY inquires: but the nature of his office has been erroneously
represented to your MAJESTY. ...I humbly hope that, in the plenitude of
your MAJESTY's mercy, you will so far spare the individual who has
misled you on this point, that you will not cause him to be thrown to
the lions, plunged into boiling oil, broken on the wheel, racked to
death, burnt alive, impaled, sawn asunder, or chopped up into small
bits. A good flogging, I would venture to suggest, might satisfy your
justice, as he only deceived you unintentionally. Having the happiness
to be one of your MAJESTY's subjects, he naturally measured us poor
barbarians by your MAJEsty's Imperial bushel. It is not very won-
derful that he should have believed the duties of that same Parlia-
mentary personage to be such as he described them. Let your
MAJEsty, only be pleased to consider with what a state of things he is
familiar, by reason of enjoying the advantage of living under your
blessed rule. For instance, the Times publishes the following sentence
as having been passed the other day on a youth at Vienna, for forget-
ting to take off his hat to his Most Gracious SoverEIGN:—
“Louis DANzMAYER, shopman, 20 stripes with a rod, and eight days' arrest in
a military prison, for inflammatory demonstrations in a public place.”
The same paper also records that, in the list of those lately tried and
condemned by court-martial, is found
“Eve PEMMELHART, for inflammatory expressions, 20 stripes with a rod, and
eight days' military arrest (irons on both feet), during two of which she is to have
nothing but bread and water.”
Vouchsafe, SIRE, to take notice, that your Royal tribunals not only
“whip the offending ADAM out of”. Louis DANZMAYER, but also the
offending Eve (not usually whipped in civilised nations) out of Eve
DEMMELHART. ... - - -
Further, the Times says that, out of several ringleaders in a strike,
“Six have received 25 blows each with a stick, one 20, and fourteen 15 blows. Four
persons are sentenced to punishment with a stick for opposing the police, and thirteen
others, whose names are not even mentioned, are sentenced to short terms of imprison-
ment, or less severe corporal punishment."
Altogether, therefore, it must be allowed that your MAJESTY's
paternal government smacks strongly of the whip. -
It is not strange, then, that HERR BLoNDERBohm (hoaxed, most likely,
by some wicked wag) should have formed and communicated to }.
MAJESTY an incorrect idea of our Ministerial “Whipper-In.” That
employé wields no other whip than the figurative scourge of exhortation.
Though sometimes called an understrapper, he does not operate with a
real strap; and I may assure, your Nº. that it is no part of his
business to flog Members, or their wives, when Honourable Gentlemen
vote in opposition to Government.

reference to the cat.

REFORM OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS.
(A Serious Omission in LoRD JoHN's Bill.)
N the good old coaching
times, travellers were
familiar with the opera-
tion of “putting on the
drag” in descending an
incline. On railways we
do not see that process
Fº but noble
eers are very fond of
putting the drag on the
wheels of the Govern-
ment Stage Coach when
driving on the Reform
road; which they regard
as going down hill.
Considering the very
slow coach views of the
Second Estate with re-
gard to political pro-
gress, Lord John Rus-
sell, probably, when he
concocted his present
Reform Bill, never even
thought of reforming the
House of Lords.
We, who think of
everything, have thought
of that. And we mean
to say what we think—
notwithstanding any
EARL's desire to the
- contrary. . .
It is an indisputable truth that there can be no such a being as a born legislator. As
unquestionable is the fact that there may be a born ass.
ſe are not proving that fact—only stating it—pace your word-snapper on the look-out for
a snap. -
But your born ass may be born to your legislator's office, and command a seat in the house
of legislators by inheritance, as in not a few examples, wherein the coronet hides not the
donkey's ears. - -
The object of a Reform in the House of Lords, should be to keep the asinines of the
aristocracy out of it: so that the business of the country may be no more impeded by their
braying, or harmed by their kicking.
Nobody is a physician by birth. Even the seventh son of a seventh son must undergo an
examination before he is allowed to prescribe a dose of physic for an old woman.
But any eldest son, or other male relation, of a person of a certain order is chartered, as
such, to physic the body corporate: which is absurd. - -
Now, the Reform we propose for the House of Lords, is, not to admit any person, whose
only claim to membership is that of having been born a Peer, to practise his profession
without examination. - -
Examine him in the Alphabet—there have been Peers who didn't know that. In reading,
writing, and arithmetic: you already make a Lord—the Mayor of London—count hobnails.
In history—for he is to help furnish materials for its next page. In geography, astronomy,
and the use of the globes; which, being indispensable to ladies, are à fortiori to be required
of Lords. In political economy, the physiology of the Constitution which he will have to treat.
In medicine, that he may understand the analogies of national and individual therapeutics;
and also learn not to patronise homoeopaths and other quacks. In geology, that he may acquire
.." idea of pedigree, by comparing the bones of his ancestors with those of the
ichthyosaurus, or the }. ation of his house with the granite, rocks. In the arts and
sciences, generally, which it will be his business to promote, if he, does his business. In
literature, that he may cultivate it; at least, respect it, and stand up for the liberty of
unlicensed printing, instead of insulting and calumniating the Press. . . - -
This is our scheme of Peerage Reform, to which the principal objection we anticipate is,
that it is, impracticable, because it can't be done; and that, warned by the confusion and
disorder that has resulted from change in foreign nations, we should shrink from touching a
time-honoured institution; which is as much as to say, that because our neighbours have
divided their carotid arteries, we had better not shave ourselves.
THE CUP OF PROSPERITY.
FISCAL returns snow that since 1842 we have consumed an immense deal of tea; a quantity,
the duty on which has contributed £5,970,000 to the revenue. This fact gives rise to various
reflections in different, minds. As the amount nearly equals the malt tax, the friends of
temperance rejoice in observing that we are almost as much tea-drinkers as beer-drinkers, if
we are not quite tea-totallers. The philanthropist will be delighted with the evidence of
our increasing friendly intercourse with the Chinese: the grocer will exult over his
improving trade. For our own part, when we consider what a quantity there has been drunk
of what, is called tea, we lose ourselves in the endeavour to calculate how many tons of
beech, elm, horse-chestnut, willow, hawthorn, and sloe-leaves, of catechu, gum, China clay,
turmeric, paddy-husk, Prussian-blue, indigo, black-lead, and silkworms sweepings, have been
swallowed by HER Majesty's subjects.

COMPLAINT OF THE COUNTRY M.P.
"MR. SpeakER, if you please, I'll sing a song."
Popular Anecdote.
FROM the mountain, from the fallow,
From the heather's breezy range,
From the wave or fresh trout-shallow,
To this House, ah what a change
Oh! what an alteration,
From the fox-chase—bless my soul!—
To this Hall of Legislation,
Worse than any badger's hole!
All our walls with damps are wetted,
And within our reeking den
We are ºf sulphuretted—
What d'ye call it?–hydrogen,
With acid car—bo—bonic,-
Here's a pretty kind of pass!—
And contracting ills pulmonic
From free hydrocarbon gas!
Whilst in one place we are stewing,
In another spot you freeze,
Some are puffing, blowing, whewing,
Others shiver, cough, and wheeze;
And this is ventilation
Upon scientific grounds,
Which has cost the British nation
Near a hundred thousand pounds.
As to Chemistry, I doubt it,
And all such-like wild pursuits,
They know nothing more about it,
Any of them, than my boots.
There's just as much reliance
On my breeches to be placed,
As there is on men of science,
Who your money only waste.
Drat 3. phosphates, and your gases,
And your FARADAys and BRANDEs,
And }. LIEBIGs, and your asses,
Who would have us drug our lands
With ammonia, paregoric,
And magnesia, crops to bring;
Hang expansion and caloric,
And all that there sort of thing!
THE CORN LAWS AND THE CROWN.
The , EARL OF DERBy has proved that—The
dear loaf is the brightest jewel in HER
MAJESTY's Crown:
The country gentlemen of England are the
bulwarks of the monarchy.
They are indissolubly connected with the soil
of the country.
To flourish in their natural vigour, they must
have high rents.
Protection gives high rents.
High rents protect the monarchy. -
Destroy protection, high rents fall-country
gentlemen decay-their connexion with the soil
is dissolved—the bulwarks are destroyed, and a
republic or a despotism ensues.
Bºgo, -The dear loaf is the brightest jewel in
the British crown.
Unwholesome Legislation.
It is lucky that most subjects of importance
to the nation are well ventilated out of Parlia.
ment before they are discussed in it. The atmo.
sphere of the new House of Commons is so
stifling, that it threatens to smother all debate.
Under these circumstances, it may be poor con.
solation to reflect that Parliamentary orators no
longer waste their breath, because alſ the air that
issues from their lungs is breathed over again.

THE HERALDRY OF PARLIAMENT.
==--- -
NEW WINDow OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONs, As seen By MR, HUME,
SoME of the windows of the new Houses of Parliament present such fearful features,
that those who have been entrusted with the glass for the purpose of staining, would have
done better by abstaining altogether. MR. HuME, who has had an opportunity of studying
the antiquities of Middlesex, has found a wondrous resemblance to our old friend, the
Red Lion of Brentford, in one of the vitreous representations of the animals that have the
honour ºf supporting the heraldic dignity of the Crown of England. Professors of Heraldry
tell us that the lion is symbolical of strength; but the creature framed and glazed in the
new Houses is a poor broken-legged brute, which seems to have been recently on the rack
-an idea that ought not to be , suggested by anything within an English House of
Parliament. The British Lion has been subjected to much humiliation at the hands of all
parties during the last few years; but he was never, seen in a more ignoble attitude than
that in which he figures at the Legislative Palace. The expression of his countenance, and
the frightful contortion of his limbs, can only indicate an excess of pain that would render
his roar a subject of pity, rather than a sound of terror.
DRIVING A FEARFUL TRADE,-Louis, NAPOLEoN has been posting about in Louis
PHILIPPE's carriages, which he has quietly helped himself to. We suggest that, for the
information of English residents at least, each time the President travels in one of these
purloined vehicles, there be scribbled on each panel:—“CARRIAGE NOT PAID.”
GOLD IN SCOTLAND.
THERE is no more doubt in the mind of the un-
prejudiced Scotchman that the true Ophir was no
other than Leith, than that QUEEN SHEBA carried
peacocks from Peebles, and monkeys from Montrose.
This, we say, has long been known to the philo-
sophic Scotchman. And now does the Isle of §:
burn with red gold, dimming and putting out the
auriferous rays of California and Bathurst. “If
we consider the geology of Skye, we have every
reason to conclude”—writes a correspondent of the
North. British Mail—“ that, it abounds in, rich
metalliferous substances.”. The Cuchullin Hills in
Skye are, with some drawback, hills of gold. Gold
“may be found near the tract of the Spey–through-
out the whole of the great glen of Scotland l’’
There is gold “on the Banks of the Conon and
Carron Rivers;” gold, in Sutherlandshire;” gold,
“especially near the Shin and Oykel, Waters!”
We believe we must give it up as a humiliating
truth, that the first gold that was ever known in
England came from Scotland; and consequently from
that time to the present, every Scotchman has felt
it to be a moral and national duty to travel south in
search of it.
THE STORM IN PARLIAMENT.
CEASE, rude Doctor VENTILATOR!
List ye Members, if you please:
Hear a brother legislator
Tell the dangers of the breeze.
*Twixt REID and BARRY they have thrown us;
On one or both the error lies;
Between the two they’ve nearly blown us
Out of window to the skies.
Hark! the Speaker hoarsely calling—
“This atmosphere I cannot stand;
The heat is really quite appalling :-
Is there no cooler air at hand?”
Now, it freezes—stop the portals;
Now with furnace-heat we glow.
Can they think that we are mortals,
While they chill and roast us so?
Now, all you on chairs reclining,
Seated round a cheerful grate,
After comfortably dining,
Think of our unhappy state.
Round us blow the Doctor's breezes,
With a fierceness that appals;
Till the Speaker, 'twixt his sneezes,
For a warmer mixture calls.
Now, the furnace-fire is roaring;
Coal on coal they frantic dash;
On us burning blasts come pouring,
In our eyes hot gas-lights flash.
Perspiration all around us;
Gusts of cold air rushing by:
Different atmospheres confound us.
Shall we boil, or freeze, or fry?
“The warmth is gone!” cries every tongue out-
The skin receives a sudden check;
They, who for air so lately sung out,
Feel cold and stiffness in the neck.
The cutting wind cuts us to pieces;
From further ventilation hold:
Now, the fearful heat increases—
Now, again, 'tis icy cold.
Overboard let’s throw the doctors;
Let them leave us quite alone:
Till by these great air-decocters
Something definite is known.
Hot and cold, with constant bother,
Too much the constitution wears;
Let them both blow up each other,
If they want to show their airs.

CHEMISTRY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
To Mr. Punch.
Lease, SIR,-Taking up the Times news.
paper, I read the following lines
in the report of LORD SEYMoUR's
speech about the ventilation of
the House of Commons:-
º
“‘As to the removal of the products
of combustion of lights in the corridors,
he (LonD SEYMoUR) had met that by dis-
pensing with , and substituting wax
candles, that #. Members might not
be troubled with the escape of gas.'
“If I had known LoRD SEY:
MOUR, I could have told him that
the products of combustion are
those things that any substance
that is burnt changes into by
burning. So, as for meeting the
removal of those products from
the corridors, by burning wax
lights instead of gas, he may
have ‘met that,’ but he did not
manage it. If LoRD SEYMoUR
would pay a little attention to his
chemistry, he would learn that
the products of the combustion
of wax lights are carbonic acid
gas and watery vapour; and those
of coal gas, when pure, are just
the same: and therefore, that he would not be able to remove the
products of burning coal gas, so as to do any good, by putting the
#. of wax candles in their place. It is true that he would prevent
the escape of unburnt gas, but preventing the escape of gas unburnt
is not removing the products of combustion. I don't know how ol
LoRD. Seymous is; but if he has a papa, his papa should take him
sometimes, as mine does me, to the Royal Institution, where he would
learn all about combustion and its products, and the difference between
them and gas that has never been burnt at all. I remain, my dear
Mr. Punch, “Your affectionate young Friend,
"RISING TEN.”
DECREE ON THE COSTUME OF THE FRENCH SENATORS.
ConsLDERING that the Senators and Councillors of State will be the
mere lacqueys of the President, it is fit that they should be reminded
of their flunkeyism by wearing the President’s livery.
It is, therefore, hereby decreed, that the followingshall be the costume
of those individuals who, on entering the service of despotism, deserve,
at all events, a good dressing.
THE SENAToks will wear a coat of blue velvet, the softness of the
material indicating their pliancy; and they will have stiff standing
collars tº assist them in hºlding up their heads,-a task they may find
rather difficult. They will have embroidered cuffs at the i. the
gaudiness of these hand-cuffs being emblematical of the salaries for
which the Senators will sell themselves.
THE CouncILLORs, or STATE will wear a light-blue coat of the
finest quality, approaching as near as possible to Cashmere, and emble.
natical of the mere cash, which will be their inducement for accepting
their situations. There will be nine gilt buttons in front, with Vº
of gold about the pockets. The waistcoat will be white, to ãº. the
wearer to put on the appearance of a clean breast; and the trousers
will be also white, to indicate, by a total absence of colour, the nega-
tive character of the wearer. The embroidery will consist chiefly of
olive leaves, the emblems of peace; and as the Councillors of State
will have nothing to do but hold their peace on every topic, the design
will be appropriate. ..
In undress, the quality of the coat is not essential: it is embroidered
about the collar and cuffs, for it is imperative that every Senator, and
every,Councillor of State, should be collared and cuffed exactly in
accordance with the will of the President.

SCENE 7–MRs. FIDGETTs (ºf 3, Albert Willas, Notting Hill) has
called on MRs. BAKER, ostensibly to return the polite attention of
that lady, in making many kind inquiries after MRs. FIDGETts, on a
late interesting occasion, but really with a view to the triumphant
display of the Baby.
Mrs. Baker (nuzzling the Baby, and addressing it in the unknown tongue
familiar to mothers, nurses, and infants). And was it a tiddy-itty—icketty—
icketty-siszy-icksy—tiddy-itty—was it, a dear? Yes—I declare, my
dear, it's one of the strongest, prettiest, healthiest, little loves of a baby
ever saw. I assure you it is—and so like his papa!
Mrs. Fidgetts. Oh! well—MRs. BAKER—I’m so glad you see the
likeness. And he is very strong, bless him!—and the nurse says he's
the largest child she ever saw—and quite plump, too—you see-bless
him 1–(giving MRs. BAKER ocular proof of the fact).
Mrs. Baker. Oh-it's a love!
Mrs. #!" I’m afraid he's a little hot. -
Mrs. Baker. Suppose I was to open the window—just a leetle.
[Rises for the purpose.
Mrs. Fidgetts. Oh, dear—no–oh! pray don't think of such a thing—
the dear baby might catch his death of cold. No-I'll just loosen his
pelisse—there.
Mrs. Baker. You must n’t worrit yourself—too much—my dear—
you know.
Mrs. Fidgetts. Oh-mo–as I’m nursing him, you know. But, really,
the fright I had, as I came along—just at ſ'. gate—a nasty dog
leapt up—at baby—and I thought he would have torn him out of
my arms!
Mrs. Baker. Dear me!
Mrs. Fidgetts. And I can’t bear dogs—you know one never can be sure
they ain't mad. -
. Mrs. Baker (rather stiffly). Oh-I hope you are above such silly pre-
judices, my dear. -
Mrs. Fidgetts. Qh—I assure you-I’ve heard cases of it!—it breaks
out years after. FIDGETTs was telling me of a case in Staffordshire
where an infant was bitten, and it never broke out till he grew up, an
got married, and began to bark three weeks after his wedding-day, and
tried to bite his wife—and died of it. Quite horrible! -
Mrs. Baker. I don't believe such stories. I’ve had dogs all my life,
and none of my dogs ever went mad (abruptly turning from the subject).
But you’ll take a glass of wine after your walk 2 -
Mrs. Fidgetts. Thank you—no wine, as I’m nursing. A very little
mild ale—if you had it.
Mrs. Baker. Oh-certainly—my dear.
MRs. BAKER rings. Enter SPRIGGLEs—followed by ScAMP (who
rushes up to MRs. FIDGETTs, and erecutes a wild frisk round
her and the Baby, leaping up in the direction ºf the latter).
Mrs. Fidgetts. Oh-it's the masty dog—that tried to bite him as we
came in l–Oh-take him out—the horrid brute!—Oh—MRs. BAKER—
pray—I shall faint—Oh—now—
[ScAMP, in a frantic bound, all but attains the Baby, and excited by
the vehement terrors of MRs. FIDGETTs, becomes more and more
violent in his demonstrations.
Mrs. Baker. Down, ScAMP there’s a good dog l—Don’t be frightened,
my dear—he's as gentle as a lamb.
Mrs. Fidgetts. Oh, the baby! he’ll have the baby—oh, dear!—the
nasty brute-oh, take him away!
Mrs. Baker (rather nettled at the coarse language applied to ScAMP
by MRs. FIDGETTs). Really—my dear—you're quite absurd—I assure
you the poor dear dog only wants you to caress him.—Down, ScAMP 1
down, good dog!
Mrs. Fidgetts. There—he will have him
[She rises, and flies to the door, pursued by ScAMP, who, imaginin
that her rapid movement is a challenge to a game of romps, bounds
about and upon her more strenuously than ever, wagging his tail,
and testifying the greatest pleasure.
Oh, dear! will you catch the horrid *::: Oh, MRs. BAKER, do

Mrs. Baker. MRs. FIDGETTs, I beg you will not speak of my dog in
that manner. He’s just as incapable of injuring your baby as I am,
ma'am, or as you are yourself, ma'am ; a great deal less, I am sure;

THE MONKEY AND THE TIGER.
The Bristol Mirror relates an anecdote of real brute life that does, in a very extraordinary manner,
present the animal combination irreverently avouched by Voltairs—namely, the Monkey and the
Tiger; MR. Wowºwell has—or had—his Ark in the jovial city of Bristol; and one of the keepers felt
it to be his painful duty to whip one of the monkeys. Now the monkey, having no sense of contrition,
and therefore refusing tº take the chastisement quietly and kindly, screamed, and yelled, and “ran along
the wires of the cages of the beasts, followed by the keeper.” Lions roared, wolves howled, and hyenas
laughed: when the, monkey was caught by a tiger, as Jocko ran by the gen, pulled in a trice through
the bars; and—with no more ado than a fine lady would swallow a fine oyster—was immediately
consigned to the tiger's maw. Here, at a bolt, was WoLTAIRE's monster incorporate—the Monkey and
the Tiger. Nevertheless, the strangest part of this strange story is to be .. The Monkey-Tiger
or Tiger-Monkey, has become so changed in his countenance that, if he could only be induced to
walk upon his hind-legs, and wear a uniform, he would pass, in certain, circles for a great practical
statesman. Already the Monkey-Tiger is known throughout the menagerie as the “President.”

ARTIFICIAL FLESHI.
An extraordinary, compound has
been discovered, which will enrich
plastic art with new features. Noses,
ears, and limbs are made, we under-
stand, by MR. F. GRAY, of Cork
Street, out of a mixture of Indian-
rubber and gutta percha; which ma-
terial so nearly resembles the natural
skin, both in look and in feel, that it
is almost impossible to tell the one
from the other. this invention,
of course, science will be enabled to
meet such a case as that of the unfor-
tunate Royal lady chronicled in the
juvenile poem:-
“The Queen was in the garden,
Hanging out the clothes,
By came a little bird
And snapped off her nose!”
The Taliacotian operation will be su-
perseded, and surgeons will,
“Outdoing TALIAcotius, from
Caoutchouc and gutta percha gum,
Mould supplemental noses—"
If this were all, it would be well;
but we fear that the discovery of a sub-
stance thus closely simulating human
flesh will open a door to gross imposi-
tion. Artificial hands coated with MR.
GRAY's composition may be grasped
and shaken, as we are informed, with-
out their factitious nature being dis-
covered. Caution will now be neces-
sary in ºf the offer of a hand;
as there is no knowing what may be
palmed off in the shape of one. Hearts
as well as hands—such is the progress
of science—may come to be made of
tta percha and Indian-rubber before
ong. To replace a lost feature with
the best substitute that can be got,
is fair enough; but what end will there
now be to the mending of faces? A
person with a snub nose will be con-
verting it into an aquiline proboscis by
.# "up its convexity with gutta
percha and caoutchouc; and thus many
of that large class of worthy persons
who marry out of admiration for ex-
ternals. will be swindled into matri-
mony by false pretences. Another,
with a small receding forehead, a low
flat head altogether, and igneous
bristles, will enlarge the upper story
in its frontal and coronal regions, and
get up a sham development of the
organs of the intellect and moral feel-
ings, as the phrenologists say, together
with a magnificent head of hair, by
means of this deceitful stuff and a wig.
Fronti nulla fides—a maxim already too
true—will be truer than ever. The
“House we live in" will be fraudu-
lently stuccoed. Succedaneous beau-
ties of Hottentot WENUs were bad
enough, but false faces will be worse
than the other falsities.
The Nobility and Gentry may be
expected to patronise the new imi-
tation-flesh, not only for the reno-
vation and repair of ancient frames,
but for the improvement of that
breed of calves which is so largely
cultivated in flunkeydom.

THE GREEN-ROOM AT THE MARIONETTE THEATRE.
It is said that actors and actresses are a great deal thrown together in the Green-
Room; but no dramatic º can be so thoroughly thrown together behind the
scenes as the performers, at the Marionettes. What little stiffness they may exhibit
before the audience, disappears behind the curtain, where the Marionette celebrities
unbend and bend in a manner quite marvellous. Anyone taking a peep into the Green-
m would suppose that the nerves of the performers, which are literally strung up in
the sight of the public, are so thoroughly unstrung, when the acting is over, that, a
collapse takes place, and a literal doubling up of the members of the troupe is the
immediate consequence.
However different may be the Green-Room of the Marionettes from the Green-Rooms
of other establishments, the puppet actors are very unlike the “ladies and gentlemen”
attached to º establishments. The puppets are, happily, not liable to sudden indis-
position, though there are some excellent singers among them; and a prima donna, who,
though attached to the establishment by ropes and wires, has a sweet voice, in which
nothing like ropiness or wiriness is at all perceptible. The Marionettes must be far easier
to º: than a regular company; for there can be no quarrelling about parts; and
though the artists have a rather peculiar walk of their own, they never come upon the
º: without apparently trying to put their very best leg foremost, for the amusement
of the audience. Notwithstanding their shakiness about the legs, we have no doubt of
their taking a permanent footing.
A MODEL ADDRESS TO ELECTORS
GENTLEMEN,+Her Majesty having dissolved the
late Parliament—(at least all that was left of it)–
I beg leave to offer myself as your future, repre-
sentative. My claims (considering the present archi-
tectural constitution of the House of Commons) to
your suffrages are these: . . -
I am above any atmospleric influence, wherever it
may come from. -
¥ can sit above a gas-lamp and despise it.
I am not to be put down by any amount of any
cold soever.
I am not to be turned by any wind. ..
I never took a cough lozenge in my life.
I know not the taste of gruel; and have yet per-
sonally to learn what is flannel.
I think that £200,000 for the ventilation of a
non-ventilated House of Commons, is a wicked waste
of public money; the more especially as it is com-
petent to any Member, to have his own castle in
the air, without employing BARRY.
Therefore, gentlemen, I am bold to ask your suf-
frages; feeling that, should you send me as your
representative to the House of Commons,—whatever
may be the colds and catarrhs of other gentlemen,
I à. always be found (wherever I may sit) to have
A Woice IN THE Country.
Preparations for War.
GREAT excitement, we understand, has been cre-
ated in Paris by the announcement, that LoRD JoHN
Russell is about to fortify the bulwarks of the
British Constitution with additional defences, in
the shape of a large number of five-pounders.
AN ATMOSPHERIC SHAM.
MR. PUNCH presents his compliments to MR.
THOMAS CARLYLE, and begs to call his attention to
the fact, that the House of Commons is not only
altogether hard-up for HEROEs, but has now not
even a WINDBAG to provide it with the means of
respiration.
THE NEWSPAPER DUTY.—Not to speak the truth
when it is likely to prove offensive to a foreign
despot.—The Prime Minister of England.
FOX MAULE AT FAULT.
MR. PUNCH presents his compliments to the Prime Minister, and
begs to call his attention to a speech made {{ MR. Fox MAULE at
Perth. , MR. F. M. denounced the Ballot; which F.M. has every right
to do: but what did F. M. couple with his idea of the worthlessness of
the Ballot? Hear him:—
“Under the ballot we have seen no respect paid to the rights of property, or to the
public authorities of the country; and under the ballot we have seen the press trampled
to the ground—gagged in a manner such as if I saw the press gagged in this country,
I would blush for the country that gave me birth.” discharge.

Mr. Punch would not, for any mundane advantage, become a tale:

any happy family soever; nevertheless, Mr. Punch wishes to know to
what or where MR. F. M. alludes? Property—authority—and the

OUR progress is “Ponter's Progress of the Nation.” Louis
Nº. progress may be said to be Deporter's Progress of the
ation.
It is quite as conspicuous as the scarlet of the line; and its motley
character is more suitable to clowns than to well-ordered footmen; its
varieties of plush, moreover, present so many distinct marks to ridicule.
A Nice Man for a Large Party.
Though LoRD PALMERSTQN may have been snubbed by his former
colleagues, the unprecedentedly long list of illustrious persons present
at his soirée the other night, shows that if he has no considerable party
in the country, he can get together a very strong party in town.
RAPID PASSAGE.
MR, MIKE O'LEARY (of Bunhill Row) started from the St. Martin's
end of the Lowther Arcade at 5 minutes to 12, and reached the Strand
end at precisely 23 minutes to 1. This is supposed to be the most
rapid passage on record. It is but fair, however, to state that, MR,
§: was accompanied on the occasion by a couple of spirited
ull-dogs.

RATHER SEVERE.
“SHALL I "OLD YOUR 'ORSE, SIR P "
TAILORS, HERALDRY.—THE
FRENCH SENATE.
M. DE CAs ABIANCA has the dressing of
the French Senate. Considering that the
senators will be little other than state
dolls, like dolls they should be as fine as
possible. They are to have—
“Palm or olive leaves embroidered in gold on the
collar, cuffs, pockets, and breast. The coat is to be
bordered everywhere with an ornament of waving
lines in gold, which, in the language of this half-
heraldic art, characterises the highest functions.”
Palm or olive leaves are very significant;
the palm for its sustaining fruit—(dates
being even more nutritious to a common-
alty than bullets)—and olives for ful-
ness and durability. For the olive is of
slow growth, like the . President's free
Constitution: whilst of the olive wood
Solomon carved his figures for the Temple.
The “waving lines in gold” characterise,
it seems, “the highest functions.” We
are afraid so: especially at the present day
in France. There, we fear, for some time
to come, a straight line is not to be
thought of.
Bribery and Corruption.
They say “the worth of any thing
ls just as much as it will bring.”
If “voters at five pounds” we quote,
How much will be the voter's vote?
We pause for a reply from MR.
Edwards.
THE FRUITs of USURPATION.—For
what fruit does M. Louis NAPOLEON's
mouth water?—Orleans plums.
THE REFORM BILL SPICED.
LoRD John's Bill does want character. It seems to have been raised
under—what historian NAPIER calls—“the cold shade of the aristo-
cracy.” Hence, certain clauses are about to be moved by certain
Members, by way of an amending zest to the measure. We have been
favoured with an exclusive copy of these amendments; and here the
. are. Their peculiar character will, we think, reveal the several
authors:–
And be it enacted, That every, or any Female Subject obnoxious to
every or any of the subjoined Misdemeanours, Accidents, or Misfor-
tunes, shall be disqualified for Voting for any Member to serve in
Parliament:
Any British Female Subject unmarried at the Age of Thirty, unless
she can º satisfactory proof that “the Question” has never
been put by Word of Mouth, by look, or even by so much as a
Squeeze of the Hand. -
Any Strong-Minded British Female Subject who can be K. to
have taken it upon herself to say that Woman is the legitimate
#. of the Creation, and the Creature, Man, a Sham and a
surper.
Any British Female Subject, being married, has no Vote, such
Privilege being merged in the Privilege of her Husband. This
Disqualification, however, does not, apply to Widows, or to
Women whose Husbands'are Abroad; Abroad, being taken in a
sense applying to and comprehending the Sea, the Colonies, the
Public-House or Club. House; when, upon all such Occasions,
it haiſbelawful for aii such Widows and all such Wives, in right
of Themselves and dead or absent Husbands, to proceed to the
Polling-Booth and give a Plumper.
And be it enacted, That at no future Election for Bedlam, shall
it be lawful for any Person who has heretofore represented any dis-
franclised Borough to be eligible to be returned as Member for
that Hospital. This Enactment is deemed necessary to protect the
Voters from the Influence of Bribery and indiscriminate Treating.
And be it further enacted, That any Two Patients (for the fitting
Representation of the #. Mania, whatever it may be) are from
Time to Time eligible as Representatives, and, when duly elected, may
take their Seat with their Keepers, and on fitting Occasions (to be
ruled by the Speaker) to pair off with other Members. And be it
enacted, That every in-door Patient shall be eligible to vote, if capable
of distinguishing, the relative Value of Money; namely, if He or She
can immediately detect Ten Sovereigns from Ten Sixpences, or a Bank
Note from a Note of Elegance. This Clause is especially enacted in
Qrder to place the Voters of Bedlam on a just, political, and social
Equality—in so far as a Right of Franchise is concerned—with all and
every unconfined Lunatic throughout England and Wales.
And be it enacted, That any Member of the Company of Drury Lane,
Covent Garden, and Astley's Theatres, is eligible to be returned as
!. Eligibility º: equally to Elephants or Horses;
such Individuals being deemed fitting and proper Depositaries of the
Interests of the British Stage.
And be it enacted, That any Two Lay Figures and any Two Royal
Academicians shall be eligible as Representatives of the Royal Academy,
to be voted by Plumpers of R.A.s; and single Votes of º: (No
Woice to be permitted to models.)
And be it enacted, That every benighted Foreigner, dwelling upon
any Door-Step, or possessing any Street-Crossing, or in any Manner or
Way having a Whereabouts within the Bills of Mortality, shall be
eligible to represent Exeter Hall. And it is further enacted, That
every Person, Male and Female, upon paying One Shilling of the
current Coin of the Realm in the Plate at the Door or Doors of the
said Exeter Hall, shall be entitled, by Wirtue of the Shilling, to Vote
for the Foreigner or Alien aforesaid, of any Caste, Creed, or Colour, as
it may be. And it is further enacted, That the Beadle shall be Re-
turning Officer of the Hall aforesaid.
And be it enacted, That there shall be, from and after the End of the
present Parliament, a Ladies' Gallery, for the especial Comfort, and
Accommodation of the Wives of the Members who may trebly wish to
hear, the Debates, to bring their Work with them, and to take their
Husbands in a º Line to their domestic Chintz when the House
shall have adjourned.
Mr. Punch need scarcely add that this last clause is the offering of a
gallant officer and-bachelor.
Night Charges.
At an Hotel:—Two Shillings.
At a Station House:—Five Shillings,
N.B.-If you sleep at the latter, you avoid the ſee that is usually
given to the Boots and Qhambermaid, and have nothing to pay for
wax candles.—Our Fast Young Man.

THE POETICAL COOKERY BOOK.
--
IBROILED BEEF-STEAE.
AIR-"The Maid of Llangollen.”
THOUGH humble the dish, or I should say the plate,
I hear without envy of banquets of state;
Contented and proud on my table to see
A Beef-steak and onions all ready for me.
My meat from the butcher I cheerfully take,
At morn, when in excellent cut is the Steak;
Then I go to a shop, where an onion I see,
And ask them to put it in paper for me.
My neighbour genteel passes scornfully by,
But pride cannot make him so happy as 1:
And prouder than even the proudest I’ll be,
When I’ve cooked my Beef-steak in the way you shall see.
Till the gridiron’s hot, I will patiently wait,
Then rub it with suet, till greasy its state;
All smokeless and clear shall my coal fire be,
Then I'll put on the Steak that’s intended for me.
When a delicate brown it's beginning to take,
'Tis the critical moment for turning the Steak;
And when on the other side brown'd it shall be,
I’ll have a hot dish waiting ready for me.
Of Dorset's rich butter, a piece standing by
Shall furnish a slice 'twixt the layers to lie ;
Then with pepper most thoroughly dredged it shall be,
Till the Steak is sufficiently season'd for me.
Though thoroughly dredged, for my Steak I must wait,
As at present but partially cook'd is its state,
And put on the fire, again it must be,
Ere 'tis done to the nicety relish’d by me.
My onion I now from its paper bag take,
And slice it and fry it, to serve with my Steak;
And sit down as hungry as hungry can be
To the Beef-steak and onions all smoking for me.
ROMAN CANDLES IN HAMPSHIRE.
We extract the following joke from the Winchester intelligence of the
Harpshire Independent :—
“NEw Lights on The PATH To Rome.—The large candles which the Rev. J.
Keele, of Hursley, keeps burning on the altar of the Parish Church during Morning
Service. Perhaps the Bishop of WinchestER will look in to be enlightened on the
subject some Sunday morning.”
Since however, our Southampton contemporary and conjoculator
publishes this statement as a piece of actual news, and considering that
there is nothing to hinder the truth from being told in fun, as HoRACE
implies, and somebody else, who for modesty's sake shall be nameless,
exemplifies ; we suppose the thing stated is put forward as matter of
fact. Nevertheless, taking the fact for granted, we cannot take it quite
seriously, because it suggests some conceptions which are somewhat
ludicrous... We imagine the hiant visages of the Hursley rustics
—Hampshiremen—staring at their clergyman's fireworks; and the
broad Doric accents wherein, doubtless, these honest countrymen
exclaim, “What the plyaague be they there canduls vor?” The inutility
and extravagance of º: daylight must be even more obvious to the
swains of this Hampshire Tempe than to the more cultivated, but,
especially on .# days, less enlightened inhabitants of Pimlico. We
would recommend MR. KEBLE, if he is in such a state of mind as to have
lights in his church of a morning—in order that the unnecessary illumi-
nation may do good to one, at least, of his parishioners—to appoint the
parish simpleton his candle-snuffer. Such a functionary would be quite
a suitable accessory to provincial church-theatricals. We dare say a
proper person could be found to fill the office. In almost every parish
* is a simpleton: where the parson is a Puseyite, there are usually
wo.
... We don't say that MR. KEBLE is a Puseyite—unless he burns matu-
tinal candles. But if he does patronise the tallow-chandler in that
superfluous manner—why, he affects, a Popish fashion. Now—we
would speak to a Puseyite as to an old lady--is not Popery improper?
Will, you—a respectable gentlewoman – adopt a fashion strikingly
peculiar to those whom you regard as improper people? If, in your
opinion, ºf. are not such, follow their fashions altogether; be
cochineal all over: don't burn candles only, but burn MR. ChañLes
RICHARD SUMNER too, if, as the Hampshire Independent suggests, he
should venture to exert authority in a diocese legitimately “governed”
by ARCHBishop WISEMAN, or one of his suffragans. - -
Qn the supposition that the reverend, gentleman really pins, his
faith and practice to the mould of mediaeval superstition, whilst holding
preferment in the English Church; it would be advisable for him to
take due care that his candles are composite, in order that they
may correspond to the pinchbeck Popery which Puseyism may be
defined to be. It is, we believe, a custom, more or less general, in
the Romish Church, to put skulls upon the altar on the 2nd of
November. Let the pastor of Hursley feed his flock, with turnips
instead of skulls. Let him burn, his candles in turnip-lanterns; not,
however, on the 2nd of November, but, on the 5th; and instead of
sticking them up in the Church, let him place them in the churchyard.
PARLIAMENTARY ARBANGEMENTS.
The famous “Rump Parliament” will have a rival in celebrity, and
partly in name, in the present House of Commons, which, in conse-
quence of its memorable debate on the subject of dining, will go down
to posterity as the Rump-Steak Parliament. -
The Arms of the Sergeant-at-Arms will henceforth be a knife and
fork.
sº Table of the House will be supplied with all the delicacies of the
SS10n.
Bills of Fare will take precedence of all other Motions.
We intend shortly to publish biographies of the leading Members,

lose his pie for having made our publication the medium for containing
any matters at all minced.

UR informant tells us that

state that the assumption of

prelates to perform, within
their respective districts,
certain functions, whereon
the future welfare of their
followers depends. In

“But, inasmuch as the claiming
and exercise of such jurisdiction is forbidden by the statute already named, the
bishops of the Catholic Church have been reduced by the said statute to the paintul
necessity of either systematically violating the law, or else of refusing to their flocks
those offices which are necessary to their salvation.”
How were the spiritual needs of the Roman Catholics supplied before
September, 1850? Why cannot their ecclesiastical rulers return to
their old position as Vicars Apostolic—let the word be “As you

SHAKSPEAREAN READINGS.
“MR. PUNCH,
“READINGs from SHAKSPEARE have become very fashionable.
Somehow the town has crowded to hear plays read by individuals,
leaving companies of actors to play to one another. I will not seek the
cause of this. BootLE says it’s late dinners—MoUNTJoy says it’s the
“slowness of the thing altogether'—and my friend, the Rev. MR.
HAROLD HENG1st, declares, in a manner that carries conviction to the
bosoms of large evening parties, that “the drama, as a successful
national entertainment, is altogether incompatible—so to speak—with
our advanced condition of civilisation. The drama,’ says the Rev.
MR. H. H., ‘to have a chance, must be exported to the colonies.” It
might, Mr. Punch, do something among the Kaffirs; though I have
seen actors that even a New Zealander wouldn't swallow. But the
present letter touches upon another matter.
“We have recently had a new Hamlet. I have not seen him: nobody
has; but I was mightily interested by a certain new—quite bran-new
—reading of his, reported in the papers. Instead of making Hamlet

y “‘When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a hernshaw–
our Hamlet split the last word into two; a hern, and a “pshaw :”
giving us a bird and an exclamation of contempt. This, Sir, is very
ingenious; and marks the courage of an inquiring mind. But allow
me to give my reading—(for I once acted in barracks). It is this:
“‘I know a hawk from a bashaw.”
. “You see a hawk is a bird with a single tail; now a Bashaw
is a Turk with one, two, or three tails; and the meaning of the
divine Swan of Avon is, no doubt, to mark the subtlety of the assumed
madness of Hamlet by making him distinguish between the bird and
the biped:
“‘I know a hawk from a bash-aw,'
with the accent, if you'please, on the first syllable.
“Yours, A LATE BUFF.”
A Dreadful Stress of Wind.
No less a sum than £200,000 has been spent by Messrs. REID and

discovered that she was short of water, and signal was made to the Victory, “Require

Poor BRITANNIA must be in a bad way when she has so little control

POLICE INTELLIGENCE.
A CONSTABLE A LA FRANÇAISE.
BEAR STREET. – Yesterday, a
man named PETER Hopkins
was brought before the Magis-
trate, charged with having used
abusive language towards a
policeman, and having assaulted
and beaten him in the execu-
tion of his duty.
SNEEK, a po-
lice constable of
the Z division,
whose nose was
much swollen,
and both eyes
black ened,
stated that he
- was on duty
last night near
the House of Commons. The prisoner had stationed himself at the
entrance of the House, and was watching, the Members go in. He
stepped up to him and asked him what he thought of LoRD JoHN
Russell, to which question he (the prisoner) returned an evasive
answer. He then inquired the prisoner's opinion about the new Reform
Bill, to which the prisoner replied that it was better than nothing, but
he considered it ought to have gone farther. . Witness then expressed a
wish to know what view the prisoner took of the ballot and the other
five points of the Charter, whereupon he (the prisoner), without any
provocation, asked, with an oath, what that was to him? and told him
that he believed he (witness) was a (using a strong expression) spy, and
otherwise miscalled and vilified him in very violent language. On
informing him that such conversation would not do, the prisoner, instead
of desisting, only became more abusive, till at fast he (witness) was
obliged to take him into custody, when the prisoner instantly struck
him a severe blow on the root of the nose, which nearly felled him.
With the assistance of six other policemen, the prisoner was secured,
and conveyed to the station-house, kicking and struggling all the way.
Having been locked up in the cell, he harangued the inmates in the
most incendiary terms, calculated to bring the police into odium, and
excite disaffection against the Government.
The MAGISTRATE asked what was the policeman's object in accosting
the prisoner?
The policeman said he suspected him of being a Chartist, and had
acted according to instructions which had been addressed to the police.
He then handed to the Bench a portion of a newspaper, from which the
Magistrate read the following passage, which had been marked by the
complainant as prescribing to the police, among other duties,
“To sound the feelings of the masses on the political or economical
innovations brought forward for discussion or study; to watch over all
that concerns the public health, and the moral and material welfare of
the population.”
is Worship asked the policeman how it was he did not know
better than to take his instructions from a newspaper? The passage,
as he would have seen if he had attended to the heading at the top of
the column, referred to the French police, not the English, and was
º of a circular of directions addressed by the Minister of Police in
rance, under PRINCE Louis NApoleon, to the Inspectors General.
The º: said it was a rascally shame of
establish such a detestable system of espionage.
The worthy MAGISTRATE told him he must not use such language as
that. It was highly dangerous, and calculated to cause a breach of the
peace between the two countries. Whatever the prisoner might
think of the President of France, or any of the acts of that ruler, he
should keep his opinions to himself, unless he could utter them without
giving offence... He hoped he would, in future see the wisdom and
§ of this course, which had been recommended by HER
Esty's Ministers and the Houses of Parliament.
The prisoner said he should not have hit the policeman if the latter
had not taken him by the collar.
The MAGIsTRATE said, that as the policeman had mistaken his duty,
he had no warrant for apprehending the prisoner, and the charge of
assault could not be sustained. He should dismiss the case, trusting
that the constable would in future exercise more discretion, and that the
defendant would, especially in alluding to PRINCE Louis NApoleon,
confine himself to more ministerial and parliamentary language.

after complaining that Brecon is not included among the boroughs of

“Why is the rising Town of Crickhowell not added to Breconº'
To which question, writes TAFFY-
* Echo answers—because it is eminently Conservative.”
Echo, in England, generally contents herself with repeating what is
said to her. We were not aware of her pursuing a different course in
any other country except Ireland; but now it appears that the Irish
Echo is matched by the Welsh. Probably TAFFY's Echº, if asked what
it would like for supper, would reply, “Toasted Cheese.”
THE LITTLE POLITICIAN.
“Now, tell me, Papa, why you say I must be
Such a very rich man to become an M. P. P.”
“Oh! first, you have so much to pay for your votes—
It may be, some two or three thousand pound notes.
But you mustn't say that; because no Member knows—
At least, is supposed to know-how the cash goes.
Then, when you’re return’d, you’re obliged, at most places,
A cup to be run for, to give at the races.
Coals and blankets at Christmas are also expected
By the poor of the borough with which you’re connected.
To new schools and churches, too, you must subscribe;
Get places for voters—in short, you must bribe:
Though, no matter how conscience your bosom may sting,
You're call'd on to swear that you’ve done no such thing.”
“Dear me, Papa! what you say seems very funny;
If to get into Parliament costs so much money,
I suppose that the Member is somehow repaid;
If not, I would rather choose some other trade.”

A SMASH FOR A SUBURB.
READER, did you ever send your wife, or go yourself, to Mitcham *
Everybody has heard of the place, but no one we ever met with
has been to it. There are half-a-dozen railways professing to go to
it, and putting down passengers at the nearest station, which is
two miles away from it. Every road out of town leads to Mitcham; but
Mitcham leads to nothing. You may go to it over any one of the ten
bridges, and you’ll get to it just as soon by one, as by the other.
Nearly all the houses in Mitcham are to let, and there is nobody to
show them, though keys, which will not open the doors, may be had
at all the house-agents'. Some of the houses that are to let have rooms
detached on the other side of the way, and gardens, a long way off,
with another house—to be let by itself—in the midst of them. "The omni.
buses to Mitcham have eighteen-pence written inside as the fare, which
is in reality one shilling; and the driver and conductor will often
quarrel with each other when a passenger asks what he is to pay, when
it becomes optional with the latter to pay what he pleases. The man at
the booking-office demands eighteen-pence as the fare, and when told of
somehody having been charged the lesser sum, he is always very indignant
with the proprietors and everybody else for “not letting him know, as
it makes him look as if he wanted to cheat people;” and, indeed,
*Pºº. are not always in his favour. -
itcham has a quantity of inns, with a large collection of all sorts
of heads and arms on their sign-boards. There are several libraries, at
one of which the word “Newspapers” is written up in large letters; but if
you go in and ask for one, you are stared at, and a child calls.“Mother!”
who emerges from an inner apartment, wiping her hands, and exclaiming,
“We never have any newspapers.”. There are several post-offices, but
when we went to post a letter at about six, we were told that the post
left at five; that it had just gone, though the clock of the establishment
stood at four: and we were further informed that there would be an
express, at seven, which being an additional post for extraordinary
despatch, would sleep for the night at Streatham. On our requestin
to be furnished with a few pennyworths of postage stamps, the officia
intimated that there was one we might possibly have, if the person who
bespoke it did not call for it. In justice to the Mitcham branch of our
great postal establishment, we ought to add that our inquiry was made
at what was perhaps only the receiving house of the village, where a
mother and child were ºff. in the divided duty of attending to
post-office inquiries and selling cheap valentines. -

THE NEW LAW OF THE FRENCH PRESS.
RT 1. No journal or periodical pub-
lication relating to anything or
anybody, or relating anything to
anybody, can be started without
a condition, enough to make any-
one start; namely, the consent of
the Government. Such consent will
only be given to a French subject,
in the enjoyment of civil and politi-
cal rights; but as there are no
civil or political rights in France,
a few of those who “enjoy” the
system of civil and political wron
will be allowed to set up a journal.
Whenever any change takes place
in the administration of the journal,
the Government sanction will be
required; and the printer must not
change his “devil,” unless it be
for one of the “devils” in league
with, and approved by, the Govern-
ment.
ARt. 2. As the truth, though
suppressed in France, may circulate
or come round through a foreign
journal, none will be permitted to
enter that country unless authorised
—which may include the selection
and payment of authors—by the
Government. Anyone introducing a
foreign journal not thus authorised,
and any traveller having amongst his luggage any article wrapped up in
an old newspaper, shall be punished by imprisonment, of from one
month to one year, and a fine of from one hundred francs to five
thousand. - ---
ARt. 3. The proprietors of any journal, treating of political matters,
or social economy, will, by way of preliminary treat, pay into, the
treasury, in cash, a sum, which, unlike the contents of his paper, will be
allowed to bear some small interest. - -
ART 4. As no paper, such as the Government will permit, can
ossibly pay after it has been commenced, it will be required to pay
É. it appears... If published without the caution-money having
been paid in }. a fine of not more than 2000 francs, with imprisonment
of not more than two years, in respect of each number published, will
be imposed on printer and publisher. A Fº reaching forty numbers,
under these atrocious circumstances, will subject the miscreants, who
print and publish, to eighty years' imprisonment.
ART. 5. Journals and periodical publications will henceforth bear the
various stamps of oppression, despotism, and servility, in respect of
which a duty of six centimes will payable. This duty will be col-
lected, with the understanding that the journals owe all their duty to
the Government. -
ARt. 6. Foreign journals will be liable to the French stamp; but no
English journal, of any respectable stamp, will submit to any other
stamp abroad than the stamp of independence. -
ARt. 7. Postage-rates, on the transport of newspapers, will be re-
imposed; as the Government cares more about the facility of trans-
porting the editors, writers, publishers, and printers, than about the
convenience of transporting the journals. -
ART. 8. As the Legislative Body is intended to consist of a collec-
tion of nobodies, their proceedings can be of importance to nobody,
and the publication of them will be punished by a fine of from 1000 to
5000 francs. -
ARt. 9. It is forbidden to the press to publish, the report of its own
trials; so that whatever trials it has to endure, it must bear and say
nothing. The journals will, however, be permitted to write freely one
sentence – namely, the sentence pronounced against any one of
themselves. -
ARt. 10. Every journal shall be bound to insert, free of charge,
every advertisement of the Government; and the puff and, paragraph
principle will be rigidly enforced, except that there will be no paid
puffs and no paid º
ART.11. In no case shall evidence be allowed of the truth of a
tº. against the Government appearing in any journal, as the
truth would be dangerous to the existing power. -
ARt. 12. As the previous articles may not be sufficiently strong,
the power of suppressing, when he likes, and as often as he likes, any
journal he likes, or does not like, will be exercised by the President.

THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF PIUSH.
A NUMERous, if not important, meeting of the Livery, including
most of the footmen in situations under the Government and Legis-
lature, assembled last night at the Coach and Horses, to discuss the
provisions of the Reform Bill now before their masters. The £5 clause
was unanimously condemned as low; but some doubt was expressed
whether that allowing a vote to payers of 40s. in the way of direct
taxation, would not fix the qualification so high as to exclude many
of the perfectly free and decidedly independent gentlemen present,
whose salaries might not be quite liable to income-tax. My Lord
DUKE said he believed that payment of assessed taxes to that amount
would qualify: did anybody know what assessed taxes, was This
question having been settled by reference to an almanack, it was agreed,
on the motion of SIR HARRY, to appoint a deputation to wait on the
PREMIER, and solicit him to reduce the 40s. franchise to the figure of
the º. which, by an easy arrangement with regard to salary,
might be charged on the individual wearer; thus conferring a voice in
the representation on any gentleman connected with a respectable
...; The EARL suggested that if Ministers would not consent to so
very large a reduction, perhaps they might be prevailed upon to come
down to the united amount of the powder-tax and the duty on armorial
bearings; and then any gentleman of the service could participate in
the privileges of a Briton, by wearing a ring or a watch, and having his
own crest engraved on the seals.

her energies to the protection of ScAMP from the infuriated Old

MEMBERS FOR INTELLIGENCE,
AN AMENDMENT ON THE REFORM BILL.
In the House of Commons, imagining himself to have a seat there, Mr. Punch moved that
a clause be added to the ex-Premier's Reform Bill, providing for the representation of literature
and science. (Laughter.) Mind was unrepresented in that House. ("Oh! oh!” from
Colonel SIRTHoRP). Yet the principle of giving the wisdom and learning of the country a
voice in the Legislature had been recognised in allotting members to the Universities of
Oxford and, Cambridge. (Hear 1 hear!). By that means, certainly, were represented the
learning and wisdom of our ancestors. (Great cheering.) Which wisdom and learning were
sufficient for our ancestors' *: (hearſ hear!) but were slightly short of the requirements
of the present. (Murmurs.) In fact, to a ſº extent, the Members of the Universities
might now be said to represent what it would not be altogether too much to call ignorance
nd bigotry–ſoh! oh!)--what had been termed by an Hon. Gentleman not in that House,
“Old clo’.” (Oh! from MR. DisrAELI.) If they represented anything else, he believed it
was old Port. (Oh! and cheers.) If the Parliamentary history of Oxford were written, it
would exhibit one continuous line of opposition to every improvement that had been made
in legislation for the last century. (Cheers and hisses). He admitted that it was not
easy to find a constituency that could be identified with information and intelligence.
(Ironical cheers.) But for want of a better, he would propose the London University. (Oh!
oh/) Let that enlightened and liberal body return two Members. (Oh! oh! oh!) . He was
aware how reasonable his proposal was. (Ironical cheers.) And therefore he did not wonder
at all at the reception it had met with (Yells, groans, cheers, braying, cries of “Cock-a-doodle.
doo/” and great confusion, amid which the Hon. Gentleman resumed his seat.)
ANOTHER PICTURE OF DISMAY.
We regret to say that the public must be upon their guard, for our Insane Artist is again
at large. This very morning were we frightened out of four-and-a-half at least of our five
senses, by his sudden apparition in our editorial sanctum, fiercely brandishing a slip of paper
in our editorial eyes, and hurling it with wild gesticulation at our editorial feet. After the
performance of this maniacal pas de fascination, the unhappy man rushed frantically out of
the room, and vanished, we are told, in the direction of the City. Upon recovering our
senses, we picked up the paper, and read as follows:-
Design for Drawing.—Agitation of our nervous friend Scargoles, who has an extensive family connection
at Paris, on reading of the anticipated “Suspension of Friendly Relations" by the President! !!!!
*...* We feel in justice bound to add that we entirely acquit the worthy Governor of Bedlam
of all shadow of suspicion in the matter. Severely as we have suffered, we would yet be
among the last to accuse him of having in any way facilitated the wretched maniac's escape.
CALEDONIA*S APPEAL.

THE LAST NEW DECREE.
Considering that there are certain maxims
and proverbs current in a sense hostile to the
Government, it is hereby decreed, that the maxims
and proverbs hereinafter set forth shall be abo-
lished, or altered in the manner following:—
For, The truth is not to be told at all times—
Read, The truth is not to be told at anytime.
For, Needs must when a certain person drives
—Read, Needs must when Louis NAPOLeon
drives. - -
For, Possession is nine points-Read, Posses-
sion is as many points as there are bayonets.
For, Speak the truth and shame the devil-
§: Hold your tongue and respect the Pre-
sident.
EXPLOSION OF A MINE IN THE
HEBRIDES 1
The gold of Skye appears, to be a substance
that might be employed in gilding aerial castles.
The Aberdeen Herald says:-
“We have been favoured with a sight of a few speci-
mens of the Skye gold, from which we find that our northern
friends are unhappily labouring under a sad delusion. The
metal approximates to the colour of gold, and has a clear
bright glitter, but so have the metallic diamonds that
sparkle in the sunbeams on our housetops, and which are at
least of equal value with the produce of our Celtic
California."
Here is appalling evidence of the educational
destitution prevalent in the Western Isles of
Scotland. The natives of Skye are manifestly
so ignorant, as to be unacquainted with the com-
monly proverbial truth, that all is not gold that
glitters. Perhaps, however, it is not their fault
that they are unable to distinguish baser ore
from the precious metal. If their currency is
limited to § it may be because they do not
see more of their landowners' money.
FAIR ENough
The British youth say—in reference to the
contemplated Militia Law—that they have no
objection to it, provided they could be first
fairly drawn, and then comfortably quartered.

THE AMBITIOUS PHAETON ATTEMPTS TO DRIVE HIS UNCLE'S CAR, AND SETS FRANCE ON FIRE.
HUSTINGS AND HEARTSTRINGS.
MR. PUNCH observes that, at the Greenwich election, the other day,
ADMIRAL Houstoun STEwART made a novel claim upon the electors.
He stated that the day of his election was his wedding-day, and urged
that, he should be particularly obliged to the yoters to send him to
Parliament on that interesting anniversary. Nor was the appeal in
vain; backed by a few other gentle influences, not unknown to
Government candidates. The Admiral was returned by a triumphant
majority. He has jumped through his lady's wedding-ling on to the
floor of the House of Commons. -
So successful an example is sure to have its copyists; and, among
the paragraphs which will appear immediately after the impending
dissolution, are the following:
LoRD Evelyn St. Gules intends to solicit the suffrages of the
electors of Guzzleby, on the ground that the day of nomination will be
his birthday. Aristocracy will not be permitted to ride rampant in the
borough; Gideon PoundER, Esq., the well-known attorney, designing
to oppose his lordship, and has every *: of success, the day of poll
being the seventeenth anniversary of that on which MR. PoundER
defeated a motion to strike him off the rolls. - -
Sir D'ARcy Snoggins will walk over the course for Killgarlick. ...No
opponent can be found heartless enough to contest, the seat with a
gentleman whose wife, last year, presented him with twins on the
corresponding Tuesday to that appointed for the election.
The Hon. BARNAcLE Mole is expected to be run hard for the
Boozy Burghs. It is true that his eldest little boy was breeched on
the 17th of June in last year, and on such an anniversary the Hon.
Candidate can hardly appeal to fathers in vain. But “good reasons.”
ShakspeaRE tells us, " must perforce give way to better,” and his
antagonist, MR. Squash (of Salt. Kels), is prepared to show that on
the very day three years from that of the election, Miss Rosa SQUAsh was
declared convalescent after the hooping-cough, and MASTER CHARLEY
SQuAsh (as can be proved by two witnesses) cut a new front tooth.
The contest will therefore be severe. - - -
The Government Candidate for West Bunkum states in his address,
that, in addition to his other claims to the suffrages of the electors, the
day on which Parliament will re-assemble is the anniversary of that day
on which he declared his first love, and offered his then nascent fortunes
to Miss, EMILY TENTERHook. This, and five pounds a-head to the
dockyard men, will go a good way towards placing the late Miss
TENTERHook's suitor at the top of the poll.
ALDERMAN BLINK tells his ward of Little St. Cheeseparings, and
the other electors of his district, that “he and his old woman” (we
quote the worthy Alderman's playfully familiar language) have always
“had a slice of luck some time this...quarter, every year since they
married,” and he hopes the voters “will not break the dº, but make
the old girl and himself happy,” by sending him to Parliament.
SIR PETER Snout is a new candidate for Whortleborough, and says
that he should not have come forward but for the singular coincidence
that, this time last year but two, all his family had the measles, and
now there's a vacancy. Under these circumstances, he expresses a con-
fident hope that he shall be returned; and adds, that though his family
had the measles, his politics have nothing of a rash character.
In fact, the advice of the late SIR. Robert PEEL must be re-con-
sidered. It is still to the “Register” that candidates must attend,
but it must be the Parish Register. John Bull has much of the
camel nature; and now those eminent naturalists, his masters, have
determined to cram him with dates.
REJECTED PANTOMIMIC TRICKS.
A RETIRED Clown has sent us the following Pantomime Tricks
which were refused to be licensed by the Lord ChamberLAIN :
A Government Dockyard being changed into a Shop for Marine
Stores—over which is written, “Best Price given for Old Iron.”
The City Mansion House being changed into a large Collier, with the
Lord Mayor officiating as a Coal Whipper, whipping the Coals in a
circuit of forty miles round London
The Vatican turning into a Caserne of French Soldiers—singing,
drinking, playing, fighting—and the Pope blessing them.
The English Houses of Parliament turned into Houses of Correction
for the British Press—a long procession of all the English Editors
(with “one base exception”), who, after being publicly whipped by the
Speaker (acting as Head Governor), are locked up, and put upon bread
and water, until they learn to speak properly of that much-abused young
man, Louis NAPOLEoN.

IMPORTANT PUNCH-OFFICIAL INTELLIGENCE I
DISSOLUTION OF OUR NATIONAL GUARD ! !
Punch Office, Wednesday, 35 Seconds to Noon.
A DECREE has just been, issued,
which, it is expected, will create
an instant and immense sensation
throughout the Qulinary Regions
of this Metropolis. The original
being prominently affiché to our
doorposts, we have had no material
difficulty in obtaining the following
true and authentic Copy:—
In the Name of the English People
|||N in general, and of
§§
HIMSELF in par-
ticular :
MR. PUNCH, Pre-
sident of the Re-
public of Letters,
Considering that
enforced order is all
very well, but that
free Self-Govern-
ment is decidedly
better—
Considering that
the National Guard
ought to be a gua-
rantee not against
the Self-Govern-
ment of others, but against the Mis-Government of themselves—
Considering that, in the Town Districts in particular, the National
Guard seem generally, disposed to pay far more attention to their
º interests than to their moral principles; as is especially evinced
y their repeated fits of abstraction (the President can use no milder
term) when on Culinary Duty—
Considering, that dangerous and indomitable propensity to Cooks,
which has led to their being considered a National Safe-Guard in
rather too literal a sense; and in some cases, even, being nominally
identified with the genus “area-sneak”— - -
. Considering the extensive series of Dissolving Views the President
mself has witnessed in his own especial larder—mainly attributable,
he believes, to the unobserved indulgence of this fatal .
Considering, in particular, the countless legs of mutton that have so
mysteriously walked themselves off from the Presidential premises—
Considering, therefore, that on a higher moral ground than that of
mere personal interest, the President is fully justified in disputing the
propriety of these Amatory and Appetital visits: and in desiring that
the National Guard should find another area for the development of
their abstract principles, than that in front of the President's own
private dwelling-house— -
Considering, again, that it has absolutely become proverbial that a
National Guard is never by any possibility to be found when he’s
wanted; from which curious physiological fact arose the popular
sarcasm, that the colour of his uniform is Invisible Blue—
Considering, also, the many, other, opprobrious epithets, his pecu.
liarities have gained him; such as “Peeler,” “Bobby,” “Crusher,”
and the like ; all which titular honours verge somewhat perilously, it is
feared, on the old copy-book conclusion, that familiarity is prone to
generate contempt—
Considering all these and many other equally grave and potent con-
siderations which the President will not now waste ink and paper in
ºff.
On the Report of No End of People, Himself and the Minister of his
Interior, especially, inclusive—
DECREES as follows:—
.The National, Guard (Blue) may henceforth consider themselves
dissolved throughout the whole, extent of the President's Republic;
and, moreover, need never trouble themselves to become re-organised
on His account.
In the Department of the Insane, any weak-minded citizen expressing
a wish for their re-organisation, is hereby referred to the General-in-
Chief, at Bedlam.
Given at the Palace of the President, 85, Fleet Street, this llth
day of February, 1852.
(Signed) 38°532C#.
(Countersigned) A. SoYER, Minister of the Interior.
. QUERY As To The NAVY PRESERVEs.—Does not so much corrup-
tion imply bribery somewhere *
OUR ADMIRAL ON HALF-PAY.
No. 2.
THIS gallant gentleman, in forwarding his second batch of manu-
script, apologises for a week's delay, caused entirely, he remarks, b
the absurd plan for ºft's the parish of Hazyton into Pleb-Biddlecum
in the new Reform Bill. The motive of that proceeding is obvious;
it is to throw the power of the representation, into the hands...of
the GRIPE RIBSTERs—a family (hints the Admiral with some asperity)
“of no very old standing in these parts.”. Really this is very painful.
But, as we have no space for local details, we proceed to the pro-
fessional part of his communication. -
“When I was in the Yelper” (he resumes, apparently threatening us
with “a yarn,”)—“one of the forty brigs named after LoRD SH's
hounds (and long since gone to the º I may remark)—we fell in
with H. M. S. Cymbeline—BLUDGEoN had her, or rather, she had
BLUDGEoN, for he was not fit to command a coal barge. Well, she got
on shore on the Spigot Rocks. She had cost an immense sum in
building; they tried her with various alterations, but it was no go
Sir! Wà. H remember all the uproar there was at the launching of
her, and how she failed at last, why, nothing but song can express my
feelings properly. So, here goes.”
The Admiral’s Song thus introduced is modelled on the “Pride of
the Ocean,” by DIBDIN, and bears the same title.
See the shore lined with Cockneys—the tide comes in fast;
The nautical ToMKINs cries, “Sharp there! avast!”
The blocks and the wedges the mallets obey,
(As the dockyards what similar blocks in town say).
Miss HIGSBY, the figure-head makes at the sign, .
Like her pa’s, have its features all reddened with wine!
And built at a cost that all Manchester shocks,
The Pride of the Ocean is launched from the stocks.
Soon the pennant is flying; the vessel they rig
For a very old sailor of family. Whig ;
And now round to Portsmouth she goes to be stored,
And has six months to wait to get seamen on board.
She’s wanted at home; so, to Malta she hies,
And, snug at a buoy, off Waletta she lies;
Then cruises a little, when—how the folks stare 1–
The Pride of the Ocean's in want of repair!
Our prize is sent home then; with ardour they burn;
They patch up the bows, and they alter the stern;
Trya fresh batch of masts; and—this seems an odd do!—
This extravagant vessel they fit with a Screw -
Still, still she won't sail; the “Returns” prove her crimes;
And the gallant SIR CHARLEY writes off to the Times.
So now, as she’ll never defend the old cause
Of our nation, our freedom, religion or laws,
Her timbers are crazy, and open her seams,
SIR BooBy, her builder, awakes from his dreams.
“Ah! he sees his mistake;” but the Lords in a sulk,
The Pride of the Ocean cut down to a hulk.
ln a postscript, the Admiral adds, that he quite agrees with the
present demand for a powerful fleet in the Channel—and, indeed, might
perhaps be induced to take the command of it, should circumstances
make it necessary. He has heard the invasion cry denounced on the
ground, that we need not prepare, as there’s no proof the French wish
to come. To this º objection the Admiral replies with con-
siderable sternness, “When I expected to be dunned at Malta in the
old ‘Insolvent,’” says he, “I did not wait till the dun was alongside to
make preparations ! I gave general orders that he should not be
admitted ſ”
This is unanswerable, we rather believe.
Our Imaginative Neighbours.
A GREAT change has taken place in the romantic literature of France.
The productions of such writers as M. EugèNE SUE have given place to
an entirely new class of compositions. The º works of fiction in the
French language that are now published are the Government newspapers.
REMEDIES FOR THE PEOPLE.
THE DUKE of Noryolk's remedy was Curry.
LOUIS NAPOLEON's is Cayenne.
ROGUY-POGUY.
THE name of “the President’s ” aide-de-camp, we believe, is
RogueT., Noscitur a sociis, says the proverb. GENERAL Roguet had
better either cut “the President” or drop the t.

Protectionist. “He He He It be our runs, Now
THE MARQUIS OF LANSDOWNE AND THE NEW
MINISTRY.
The first act of the Ministry in the House of Lords was done with
the worst of grace. The MARQUIs of LANsdowne took farewell of
office and of official life. And who was there, among the new men, to
do reverence to the unstudied yet touching ceremony? Nobody, save
the EARL or MALMesbury. The Times says, and most truly:
“A public life which has literally embraced the first half of this century, and which
was last night most gracefully concluded, deserved an ampler and richer tribute than
our new Foatian Secretany seemed able to bestow."
Nothing could be colder, meaner, and certainly more foreign to the
heartiness of English generosity, than the chip-chip phrases of Lond
MALMesbury. It is such men as the MARquis of LANspowNE who
are the true strength of the House of Lords. He is a true Englishman.
In fifty years of political life his name has never been mixed with aught
mean or jobbing. In the most tempestuous times, his voice has been
heard among the loudest for right. In days, when to be a reformer
was to take rank a little above a fanatic and a public despoiler, the
MARquis or LANsnowne struck at rotten boroughs. He has ever
been a patriot in the noblest sense. And there was nobody, but cold-
mouthed MALMesbury to touch upon his doings? So it is!
“Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
whose scraps are good deeds past.—"
But the political deeds of the MARQUIs of LANspowse are written
in the history of his country. After the wear of fifty years, not one
spot rests upon his robes. His coronet borrows worth and lustre
from the true, manly, English brain that beats-(and in the serene
happiness of honoured age may it long continue to beat!)-beneath it.
A Hope for France.
The Moniteur has published a decree announcing the alterations that
are to be allowed in the liveries of the Senators and Councillors o
State. Cloth is to be used instead of velvet; and there is to be a
considerable curtailment of gold lace. This compliance with the wish
of the Senators as to an alteration in their clothes, is hailed by some as
a hopeful sign; for it looks as if there were some grievances that may
lead to re-dress.
Our Lady of Atocha.
THE QUEEN or SPAIN has offered her robes and jewels, worn when
struck by the assassin, to our Lady of Atocha. But why not the
whalebone stays that defended the mortal attempt of the dagger?
Believing, as we do, that whalebone stays have had so many victims,
slowly killing thousands of young women, we confess we should like to
†. º: offering of that valuable work of whalebone that has saved the
ite of one.
THE DER BY EVENT.
BENAMIN Disraeli is truly grateful to his friends for the proud
position they have now placed him in. He will have now every facility
in manoeuvring the TIP, which he will have the greatest satisfaction in
forwarding. He begs the public not to be imposed upon by pretended
prophets on the results of the Derby, for he feels assured of his being
able so to manage the TIP, as to leave no doubt about the winner.
Those who feel undecided about joining him, are referred to what he
has said at different times about the Russell lot, and see if his predic-
tions have not been verified. His advice is now sought in the very
highest quarters; and his lists contain some of the most decided odds
that were ever presented to public notice. All letters to be addressed
to his new Office in Downing Street.
FIVE SUNDAYS IN A FEBRUARY | 1 ||
..THE Unreflecting probably have never noticed that, in the month which,
like the Russell Ministry, has just gone out, the above extraordinary
event has taken place. In the twenty-nine days of February there were
five Sundays. Such an unusual occurrence, we are informed by a patient
man who has given himself the generous trouble to calculate, will not

When London, is supplied with good water, cheap gas, perfect sew-
erage, and unadulterated milk,

INFANCY OF CRIME IN SCOTLAND.
He ºdinburgh News narrates as follows:
* A strange but absurd case was brought
before Wu-Liam L. Colquhous, Esq., of dia-
thick, as Justice of the Peace for the county
of Perth, at Crief, on 10th instant [ult.], at
the instance of Lord and Lady wil-
Loughby DE EREsby and Louis KENNEpy,
their factor, as their mandatory, against two
children of MR. Middlexuss, labourer, Mu-
thill, of the respective ages of two and sizyears.
The youngest child attended the learned Jus-
tice carried in its mother's arms. The charge
brought against them was that they had been
found in the act of laying snares for the pur-
pose of catching game in an adjoining field to
the village of Muthill.”
The crime was proved, at least to
the satisfaction of the magistrate, for
the evil-doers, aged six years and two,
were fined each £16s. 10d., including
expenses; or, failing payment, thirty
days' imprisonment.
e applaud the sagacity of the
sentence. Would a sportsman, with
a love of partridges at heart, spare a
- - nest of young polecats; would he not
kill the small vermin even in their blindness? and what is a poacher
of two years old other than a young polecat ; a thing to grow and
strengthen in mischief ?, Moreover, a sane and healthy child of two
years old must be held self-accountable. Did not St. AugustiN
reproach himself, in after-life, with infantine gluttony at the maternal
breast And this thought suggests in us another. If the Game
Laws are to be adjudicated in the spirit developed in the above
sentence, it may be necessary for the Perth Magistrates to cause some
such advertisement as the subjoined to be printed in the county papers.

|NVASION OF ENGLAND
IN 1853,
John Bull (quizzically). “I’M Not sure, MASTER PRINCE PRESIDENT, THAT It’s RIGHT to ALLow Foreign REFUGEEs to LAND
IN ENGLAND.”
THE INWASION PANIC.
OUR seaside correspondence is written with º such trembling
hands, that it is scarcely legible; but we have been able to gather from
it the following particulars. At Gravesend, the painting of the
Bathing-Machines is looked upon as an indication of alarm, on the part
of the authorities; and it is said that each machine is to be fitted with
a gun—to protect the bathers in the brackish waters that lave the
mud-bound shores of that laughing locality. One of the defensive
measures about to be taken will, it is said, be the raising of the prices
at Tivoli, to render it more difficult of access; and NATHAN's proud
BARON will, it is said, dance his celebrated egg hornpipe every night,
so that there may be plenty of shells always ready to hurl at the enemy.
The panic is not confined to the Kentish Coasts, but it has extended
to the very skirts of the Bristol Channel, and the proceedings of the
Board of Health—who have sent a Sapper into Clifton to take an
observation—have given rise to observations of an alarming character.
The gallant fellow who is posted on the tower of Clifton Church is
looked up to with a sort of awful interest, for he is supposed to have
been raised to his present elevated position with a view to his obtaining
a good view of the movements on the Bristol Channel. Whenever he
descends to his meals he is beset by all sorts of questions, which he
answers with a sort of sour brevity, and pointing to his surveying
instrument, he reduces every inquiry that is made of him to the same
dumpy level.
Cabinet Intelligence.
THE SYRIO-LEBANON FAMILY (late of the Egyptian Hall and the
Holy Land) left their cards upon the new, CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchequER yesterday. . It is not yet confidently known whether they
will have seats in the Cabinet—but, considering the Syrians generally
sit cross-legged on the floor, it is perfectly immaterial to the SYRIo-
LEBANON FAMILY whether they have seats in the Cabinet or not, as
long as they are accommodated each with a piece of carpet.—The
Observer, improved upon by Punch.

RURAL CHURCH DISCIPLINE.
THE subjoined extract from The Reading Mercury's report of the pro-
ceedings of the County Bench, Newbury Division, might be chronicled
in a volume of “Curiosities of Police Intelligence.”
“Thursday, FEB. 12.
“(Present–W. Mount, E. B. Bunny, C. Eyre, R. Tull, C. Slocock, J. Hughes, T. H. Smith,
H. R. Eyre, and H. M. Bunbury, Esqrs.)
“Richard Middletox, a youth, and hired servant to MR. Job Lousley, of Hamp-
stead Norris, was charged with not attending his church twice on Sunday, Feb. 1st, in
accordance with the agreement entered into when he was hired.
“MR. Lousley informed the Bench, that he always attended church twice on Sundays
with the farm servants, but the boys had several times behaved bad,” and done much
mischief, ar.d Middleton had refused to go to church more than once on a Sunday-
The boy pleaded guilty to the charge.
“The Bench said, that as he had entered into a contract when hired to attend divine
service twice on Sundays, he could not break the agreement, and after giving him some
seasonable advice, ordered him to pay the expenses, 7s.6d., which were to be abated
from his wages, 6d. per week.”
Absurd, however, as the above charge may seem, their Berkshire
Worships were right in entertaining it. Dick MiDDLETON, havin
hired himself to perform, among other labours, that of going to church
twice on Sundays, was as much bound to fulfil that 3 ligation as to
drive the horses, work in the fields, sweep the stables, or feed the pigs
of MR. Lousley. True, Richard, by going ºil; to church, and
being, mentally elsewhere, would not have attended divine service.
But he was not had up for not attending divine, service, but
for neglecting MR. Lousley's service. What service he could have
rendered that gentleman by the mere display of his person in the sacred
edifice, it may be for us to inquire, but it is not for MR. Lousley to
answer, unless he chooses. The loss of 7s 6d. will now probably teach
him to go to church according to his bond, and do his duty to—
MR. Lousley.

MORALS OF “THE MAHOGANY.”
MR. PUNCH Discourses with AN “M.P.” ABOUT To VISIT PARIS.
Q. WHAT is dinner? -
A. Dinner is an arbitrary term. It may mean a mess for a dog; it
may comprehend the noblest work of man.
§ o you then conceive dinner to be the test of civilisation ?
4. Undoubtedly: the savage feeds; the gentleman dines. ..
Q. Does feeling or morality enter into the composition of a dinner?
A. Neither one nor the other: it is impossible.
Q. State your grounds of impossibility. -
4. Feeling and morality, according to the last anatomical discoveries,
and conventional figures df speech, dwell in the heart and in the brain.
Q. Granted. . Proceed with your impossibility.
A. The heart is a hollow muscle, and does no work of digestion,
neither does it taste: the brain is an organ of two hemispheres, united
by a corpus callosum, an organ that digests not, neither does it taste.
Ergo, feeling and morality are independent of the act of dining—of the
ceremony denominated dinner.
Q. Man is then a free agent to dine or not dine with whomsoever
may invite him?
A. Assuredly : such would be my definition of Free Will.
Q. But how, if the man be “commanded ” to dine?
A. He then treads his Free Will under his feet, drawing on his
patent leather boots.
Q. This supposes that the “command” issues from the head of the
State, whatever that Head may be, and whatever the State it
denominates?
A. Indubitably. Britons never shall be slaves, save and except when
“commanded” out to dinner.
Q. What is your opinion of SouLouque, Emperor of Hayti?
A. He dawns, or rather darkens, on my mental perceptions, as a very
greasy º: of about eighteen stone. Half-moon cocked hat, with
cushions of gold for epaulets. -
. Suppose yourself in Hayti, commanded by the Emperor to dinner.
What would be your course *
A. Of course, the—dinner-course.
Q. But if your host had made his way to the head of the table
through “wholesale butcheries?” --- - - -
A. As his guest and a foreigner, I should eschew politics; sinking
my host's butcheries in his butcher. -
Q. If your host had shi †: off thousands of the innocent to pesti-
lential º how º that incident affect your stomach *
A. Not at all: what have I to do with men in captivity, so that the
venison has been well kept *
Q. And bloodshed—
A. Bloodshed! pooh! Should any blood in the world stop the
Burgundy?
Q. Very good. You may proceed upon your travels. Stop. I will
*g you at the Islands of the King of the Cannibals.
. Suppose it. Well? - - -
Q. And I will suppose you “commanded” by his cannibal Majesty
to dinner. Would you dine *
A. No; but i. me, only for this reason—no other. I
should respectfully shirk that “command,” lest I should be called upon
to *. my own joint.
Q. But otherwise you are unprejudiced—open to any other command?
A. So much so, old boy, that only look in the Moniteur next week,
†. you’ll see I’ve knife-and-forked it, by “command,” at the
Tuileries.
THE BOEUF GRAS, AGRICULTURE, AND PROTECTION.
Two great events astonished—for we can scarcely say, delighted—
the capitals of France and England at the same time last week.
The one in Paris was the procession of the Baeuf Gras.
Mº one in London was the entry into power of the DERBY
inistry.
#’events, however, were distinguished with the same charac-
teristics. Agriculture was the leading feature of them both.
In the Baeuf Gras procession, Agriculture rode in a chariot drawn
by six white horses. , She stood, almost concealed, in a mock field of
corn, and in her hand was a sickle, as if she were going then and there
to gather in the harvest. - -
And in the Grand DERby Procession has not Agriculture also been
made the most, prominent figure, and does not the party, which it
represents, stand involved up to its eyes in Corn? It has all its instru-
ments ready, and is provided with a large number of hands eager to do
whatever Agriculture bids them; but it is yet doubtful what kind of
harvest the Corn question will yield, and everyone is afraid to lay a
hand upon it. -
What if this same corn-field should turn out, as in the Boeuf Gras
cortège, nothing but a mock field of corn made up of printed P. and
Parliamentary returns, richly coloured with the golden hue of promise !
What if this same figure of Agriculture is only a Show figure, merely
introduced to swell the procession that carried the Protectionist party
into power And what if, the Show now being over, Agriculture was
taken down from its elevation, and put aside, until wanted for some
similar occasion'
. But these speculations as to whether Agriculture will be retained or
discarded—whether Corn is to be the great war-chariot of the Pro-
tectionists or not—are scarcely worth consideration. The Bauf Gras
rocession was only a three days’ wonder; and we do not think the
ERBY Ministry º much longer.
THE POETICAL COOKERY-BOOK.
—--
Id EV II, LED BISC UIT.
AIR-"A Temple of Friendship.”
Nice Devill'd Biscuit,” said JENKINs,
enchanted,
“I’ll have after dinner—
the thought is divine !”
The biscuit was bought, and
he now only wanted—
To fully enjoy it—a glass
of good wine.
He flew to the pepper, and
sat down before it,
And at º; the well-
butter'd biscuit he went;
Then, some cheese in a
pastemix'd with mustard
spread o'er it,
And down to be grill'd to
the kitchen 'twas sent.
“Oh how,” said the Cook,
“can I this think of
grilling,
When common the pepper?
the whole will be
flat.
But here's the Cayenne; if my master is willing,
I’ll make, if he pleases, a devil with that.”
So the Footman ran up with the Cook's observation,
To JENKINs, who gave him a terrible look:
“Oh, go to the devil!” forgetting his station,
Was the answer that JENKINs sent down to the Cook.
A CRY FROM THE POSTMAN.
“MR. PUNCH,-You have always said your best for the postman:
give us a few words at this writing. The Act—or Order in Council—
or whatever it is—has come in which allows folks to send books at 6d.
a pound from one end of the country to the other. Well, this is all
right enough ; and I don't mean to complain; but I must ask who is
to carry 'em *
“My walk’s in a neighbourhood of everlasting readers. I know it,
I shall have a hundred volumes a day to deliver; and is there to be no
extra pay a week for bent back and worn shoe-leather P
“Once I called myself a postman; but with this new regulation for
delivery of books of all sorts, I must, Mr. Punch—(again asking your
good word for a little extra pay)—sign myself
“Yours, A Two-LEGGED CIRCULATING LIBRARY.”
“P.S.. I’ve heard it said that each of us, is to be allowed a light
pony chaise for our delivery: but if this is really too good to be thought
of, mayn't we have a donkey and panniers ?”
Easy Little Sums for our New Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Two and two make four.
What is the Square of 16?
If Shrimps cost three-halfpence a pint, what will three quarts come to?
What will be the half-year’s Fº upon a sum of £300, in
the 34 per Cents?
If the circulation of the “Base Erception” amounts as high as 811
at the end of the month, how many copies does it sell daily?
If a young lady takes a silver fork and spoon to school with her,
calculate the chances of her parents ever seeing them back again?
If the subscribers of the Gentleman's Magazine are, respectively,
79, 83, 87, 94, and 106 years old, what do their united ages amount to?

A SCHOOL FOR MINISTERS.
It would be an excellent speculation just now, for some
enterprising bookseller to bring out a series of ministerial
Primers or Horm-books for Statesmen just entering on the
study of the art of Government. Many of the new Cabinet
would have to begin with the very A, #. C, of official edu-
cation; and whether they will ever get beyond their ''.
bet is a doubt, for it is not likely they will have a very long
spell of their present positions.
A sort of official Infants' School, where the Members of
the New Cabinet might be instructed in the rudiments of
their new art, would be an excellent addition just now to
our public establishments. One of the first classes formed
ought, perhaps, to be a drawing class, to teach the minis-
terial pupils how to draw their first quarter's salary.

A FRIEND'S ADVICE TO DISRAELI.
ENJAMIN DISRAELI, the new
Chancellor of the Exchequer,
belonging to the honourable
order of the Inkstand—of which
we are admitted to be the Grand
Master—we cannot help feeling
an interest in his success, and
we therefore are anxious to give
him a few hints by way of en-
suring it. The means of well-
merited popularity are in his
hands, if he will * the game
as we counsel him. In the first
place, he will have to deal with
income Tax, and will, we
trust, show his sympathy with
the workers—to whose class he

earnings of labour—intellectual
as well as manual – from the
same tax as realised property is

- Eºs et him also propose the abo-
* - - , , , lition of all the taxes on know-
ledge--a step, which will gain him the approbation of all who are
employed in disseminating knowledge; a pretty considerable power
for a Minister to have in his favour. He may #e. the Agricultural
interest by an equalisation of the poor-rates–a peculiar hobby of his
colleague, LoRD MALMESBURY: and whatever may be the fate of the
Ministry, DisRAELI will, at least, have deserved well of his country.
We, at all events, hope he may prove himself equal—notwithstanding
his wit—to the mysteries of L. S. D., and that his wisdom of the pen,
or penny wisdom, will not turn out to be pound foolishness.
THE PAROCHIAL REFUGEE QUESTION.
We understand that the Beadle of St. Pancras has addressed “recla:
mations” in the name of his (parochial) Government to the Beadle of
Marylebone, (on the subject of the juvenile refugees who are permitted
to indulge in certain menées révolutionaires on the borders of both
parishes. We do not §: the text of the despatch, but we understand
that the Beadle of St. Pancras alludes especially to a demonstration at
the boundaries, on an occasion when “Young Marylebone" assembled
in great force for the purpose of carrying on machinations of a most
objectionable character. The St. Pancras Government complains that
there is an organised system of hop-scotch all along the southern
frontier, and . the game of “cat” is frequently played under the
nose—sometimes ending in the eye-of the gold-lace constituted autho-
rities. The Marylebone functionary has made a spirited reply, in which
he claims, in the name of his Government, the right of an unlimited
hospitality; and adds, that the boundary line on his side has often
been infringed by marbles and duck, when either of those games have
been played on the frontier. He concludes an admirable manifesto by
declaring he would rather resign his office, and place his cocked hat at
the disposal of the Westry, than succumb on the present occasion. Thus
the matter stands for the present.

MANNERS IN THE WOODS AND FOREST.S.
EMoANING the departure
of Lord SEYMour from
the Woods and Forests,
the hamadryads must
have breathed a piteous
sigh. Never was there
so blithe, so debonnaire,
so civil, a minister. The
very satyrs might have
learned courtesy of him;
and Orson, the wild man,
become, by ministerialex-
ample, the pink of gentle-
ness. Nevertheless,
our keen regret for
a lost SEYMoUR is
attempered into to-
lerable grief by the
genius of the new-
found MANNERs –
possibly the best,
and, withal, most
significant appoint-
A ment of the whole
**Cabinet; for the
poetic LoRDJohn is
endeared to the re-
collection of trading
England by an im-
mortal couplet, to
shine for ever in
-- - - - - the eyes of English-
men. Here it is, impossible to be soiled, as Milton says, as are the
sunbeams:
“Let laws and learning, wealth and commerce, die,
But leave us still our old nobility.”
Let the Houses of Parliament house foxes and badgers; and let the
hare make her form in the SPEAKER's Chair—let Cambridge and
Oxford become cities of the dead—let the Bank of England break
º: ** and the docks and all they contain crumble with dry
rot, but-
But leave us still our BEAUFoRTs, our TALBots, our DeRºys, our
De Rooses!
Now, woodcraft and forestcraft are especially the learning and
accomplishments of our old nobility. The Forest Laws were animated
by the humanising spirit of that old nobility, that made man’s life
yery much cheaper than beasts’; and, although the vulgar influence of
laws and learning, wealth and commerce, and the like, has destroyed
much of the old romance that consecrated buck and do: ; there, never-
theless, lingers about our Woods and Forests—(much of them, at the
present writing, woods of building and forests of chimneys)—a pleasant,
wild, romance, that has its prettiness to the milk-diet taste of Young
England. For, as our present Woods and Forests are to the forests
of the eleventh century, so is the white waistcoat of Young England
to the hauberk of the time of John. And Lord MANNERs wears the
modern waistcoat with a grace that gives us great hopes of him in the
modern Woods.
A DAY OF RESIGNATIONS.
The Royal Ink and Umbrella Stands must have been inconveniently
full on Friday last, when the various officials attended for the purpose
of resigning their respective seals, wands, and single-sticks. The royal
châtelaine must have been also rather encumbered by the weight of
keys; and the MARQUIs of BREADALBANE's gold one, as Lord Cham-
berlain, must have proved a somewhat serious appendage, until Her
Majesty was relieved of it y the MARQUIs of Exeter. Fortunately
the parties were soon at hand to unburden the Royal apartment of the
unusual accumulation of official emblems; and we trust that in new
hands they will prove more effective than they have done in the old
hands for the last year or two.
The MARQUIs of WESTM InstER has, we erceive, delivered up his
wand-an absurd emblem for a Lord Łºś. in whose hands a
wand must be of little use, as he is certainly, in most cases, no
conjuror. In a sensible reign like the present, this distribution of
seals which are never used, keys that open nothing, and other unmean-
ingappurtenances, might be done away with—the sticks to some of the
little lords, being the only insignia that seem to us appropriate.

SAFETY UNIFORMS.
- UR GRACIOUS QUEEN's
Government having signified
HER MAJESTY's willingness to
accept the services of Volunteer
Rifle-corps, the equipment of gentle-
men desirous of uniting in defence
of their Sovereign and Country,
becomes a matter for consideration.
In accordance with the practical
suggestions of several distin-
guished military officers, and
others, care has been taken to
provide a great variety of patterns
of uniforms, the colours of which,
assimilating to every conceivable
shade of surrounding objects, cause
the wearer to present as indistinct
a mark as possible to the enemy's
aim. Besides the neutral greys
corresponding to the mixed colours
of the heath, and the brown mix-
ture identical with the colour of
the mud, samples have been ma-
nufactured of slate-colour and brick-
dust, red, calculated for house-top
service amongst the chimney-pots,
of bright green with mother-of-
pearl and gilt buttons intermingled,
adapted for field-fighting in case of
an invasion occurring at the time
of the daisies and buttercups; of straw-colour for a harvest or stubble brigade, and
of snowy white, which would be a suitable tint if we were to be attacked simul-
taneously by the foe and the frost. A splendid pattern has also been made of cloth of
gold and silver, the dazzling effect of which under a glare of sunshine, in the midst of
a Turneresque landscape, would be such as utterly to bewilder the aim of the most
expert marksman. All these wonderful uniforms, warranted incapable of being hit,
besides a regulation rifle guaranteed never to miss, to be had at MEssas. PUNch and
Co.'s, Army Clothiers, 85, Fleet Street; where every species of Gentlemanlike
Dressing is supplied to those requiring a superior article and good cut.
*...* P. and Co.'s Military Clothing is pronounced first-rate, not only by gentlemen
but by ladies, and whether or not there is any fighting in store for the wearer, will
render every such gallant hero certain of conquest.
MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,
THE putting together of the new official bundle of sticks has been a
work º considerable difficulty, and the “rumours,” during the course
of the operation, have been vague and numerous. Some of the reports
in circulation, which have not yet appeared in print, are given below
upon “our own correspondent’s” authority,
Up to a late hour last night Colon EL SIBTHORP had not accepted
the Secretaryship of the War department—an appointment which had
been much talked about by his own friends and acquaintances. Several
reasons have been given for his not having yet joined the Ministry, but
we have good ground for believing that the true reason is, he has never
been asked to do so. -
Considerable sensation was excited by a report, that MR. BRIEFLess
had just received the Great Seal, which proved to be a fact; for
he on Wednesday took out of pawn, and received into his own
hands, the great seal that formerly hung to the watch of his great-
grandfather.
One of the vacant posts, at the Treasury has been accepted by
Cribbage-faced Bob, who will henceforth occupy, as crossing-sweeper,
the lamp-post opposite the Home Office.
Much embarrassment has been occasioned to the Premier by his
uncertainty as to the fittest person to hold the office of Black Rod
there being so many members of the Protectionist party whom the ro
would be well bestowed upon.
HOPEFUL YOUTHS.
Passing the other day along the Strand, we observed a large number
of omnibuses and vans, in front of Exeter Hall, filled with small chil-
dren, who were shouting and hallooing with all the force of their little
lungs. What they were bawling for, we did not know, nor do we
exactly understand now, although we have discovered that the juveniles
in question were the members of the “Bands of Hope,” connected
with the Temperance League, who were going to meet in the Hall
under the presidency of somebody or other. Besides cheering and
huzzaing, they attracted public attention by means of various flags and
banners which they carried. In short, they were, at the instigation of
those who ought to have taught them better, making a noisy demon-
stration, and creating an obstruction in the street. We do not quarrel
with the natural disposition of children to be obstreperous, but we do
protest against the conduct of persons who, under the pretence of
making thern teetotallers, encourage them in intemperate manifes-
tations. ...We respect the principle of total abstinence, when simply
conscientious: but we have no respect for the motive or impulse
which so very generally occasions its professors to behave, when
sober, as no other people do, unless they are drunk; -
During the present season of Lent, our friends, the Roman Catholics,
make it a matter of religion to abstain from meat; but what would be
thought of them if they incited their children to parade the thorough-
fares in carts, with the symbols of their creed, proclaiming with frantic
vociferations their devotion to red-herrings?... Let our other friends of
Exeter Hall perpend this consideration. Of a piece with the decency
of causing these inſants to thrust themselves on public notice by
clamour, was the taste of making them go, through the farce of
tºº. address, savouring equally of cant and conceit, to “His
Roy AL HIGHNess ALBERT, Epward, PRINCE OF WALEs.”. We cannot
suppose this production could have been composed by any of the children
themselves, as there is a fulsome vulgarity of tone about it which
evidently betrays the mature snob. If the Young Hopefuls of Teeto-
talism had been left to themselves to address the Prince, they might,
perhaps, have expressed their ideas in some such terms as these :-
“To the PRINCE OF WALEs. Please your Roy AL HIGHNEss. We
take up our pen to write you a few lines to inform you that we have taken
the pledge. We have promised to give up brandy and water. We are
not going to take any more wine, beer, or spirits. If we never drink
such things we shall never get tipsy. We would advise you never to
take anything stronger than tea. Drinking does harm. Eating is
quite pleasure enough. We may have plum-cake, and puddings and
pies, and hard-bake and lollipops. We must now conclude, with duty to
your mamma, and accept the same yourself; and hoping you approve
the Temperance Band of Hope, id will set an example of the same,
and excuse all errors.” -
. Childish language would have been the fittest vehicle for the expres-
sion of imbecile impertinence.

CHARIVARI.
DISTURBED BY THE NIGHTMARE ; A SILLY HOAX.
Suggested by the New Ministry.
A WOICE FROM THE LUGGAGE WAN.
SENTIMENT in connection with the shoulder-knot is nothing alto-
gether new, but the pathos of the porter's knot has, all the º;
interest of complete novelty. One BILL BATEs, who has lately retire
from a Railway platform, where, he has been accustomed to the
lugging about of luggage, has taken his farewell in the following
touching circular. It is so good, that we cannot resist the temptation
to print it entire.
“WillIAM BATEs, in quitting the service of the ‘London and South-Western
Railway Company,’ in whose employment he has now been six years, desires to
express to the passengers on that Line (and particularly to those from the Twickenham
Station), his gratitude for the urbanity and kindness with which they have ever
treated him in the discharge of his duties; and trusts that their approval of his
conduct, during the time he has been known to them in his past service, will follow
him throughout life—in whatever position be may hereafter occupy.
“TwickeNHAM, February, 1852.”
There is something exquisitely affecting in the enlarged sense of
ratitude felt by BATEs towards all the passengers on the South-
'estern Railway—including, of course, its various branches and loops
—for the “urbanity and kindness” they have ever shown him in the
discharge of his duties. We do not quite understand how the dis-
charge of a porter's duties could call forth “urbanity from the public; ”
but we presume that he never disencumbered a traveller of his carpet-
bag without an interchange of those courtesies which give grace to
social intercourse. There is a nice touch of discrimination in the
expression of particular gratitude towards those from the Twickenham
Station, whom he seems to regard as the residuary legatees of all the
ſinest feelings of his nature. He, however, proposes to lead the
travellers on the line a “pretty dance,” when he expresses a hope that
they will “follow him throughout life, in whatever position he may
hereafter occupy.”
It is expecting, we fear, too much from the public at large, to hope
that ever and anon the question “Where is BiLL BATEs?” will force
itself on the mind, and lead to the searching of him out, that he may
be still praised for the achievements of his ºf. porter-hood. We
are rather surprised that he should have retired so abruptly into private
life, without some preliminary announcement of his intention; and,
indeed, he might have followed the theatrical practice in quitting
the Railway platform or stage, . going once through the round of his
favourite *:::::::: He might have advertised his last appearance,
as the “Man with the Carpet-bag; ” or taken his farewell of the
passengers in a grand luggage delivery, on an extensive scale, for his
own benefit.
A FIDDLE-PATTERN CLERGYMAN.
THERE was once a saint called CHRysostoyſ—Saint GoLDMoUTH, as
we should say in the vernacular. Our modern establishment can boast
of a man of metal—now that California and Australia have comparatively
cheapened gold—not much inferior. The existence of this holy
personage is revealed by the Ecclesiastical Gazette, in an advertisement
setting forth, that
AN M.A., Oxon, who has been in Orders eleven years, and during that
time has received Five Public Testimonials of Plate, wishes for a CURACY in
an agricultural district. Sole charge preferred.
For a clergyman of such worth in plate as this, we would propose, as
a parallel to the name of CHRYsostom above mentioned, the title of
SILVERMUG. We cannot, however, help thinking that “Five Public
Testimonials of Plate” are not quite so obvious a qualification for a
curacy in an agricultural district, as they are for the situation of
a butler; and it seems that their possessor would be less likely to shine
in the Church than in the dinner or tea service.
Awkward Mistake.
Fortunately not made in a Pantomime.
A CLow N, designing to enter a Rifle Corps, called on Lord BLANKE,
Colonel of the 999th, and saying he understood that his Lordship was a
clothing Colonel, begged the noble Lord to measure him for a uniform
of invisible green.

as applied to HER MAJESTY's new Ministers. For, as the Doncaster
Gazette observes—
“The turf is wonderfully well represented in the present Cabinet, which combines
four of its stanchest supporters in the persons of the Premier, the President of the
Council, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and the Master of the Horse."
The last-named appointment, doubtless, is filled by a competent
person. We wish we could say as much of the others.
“PAY FOR YOUR BREAKAGES.”
We should like to see the same law carried out in the Naval, as is gene-
rally enforced in the Domestic Service; namely, to make the servants of
the public pay for everything they break if this law had been in opera-
tion, we do not think #. late Lords of the Admiralty would have had to
receive much, at the end of any one year they were in office, out of
their year's salary. In fact, taking the iron ships into calculation, we
think that they (instead of the nation) would have been considerably
out of * every year they remained in the public service at the
Admiralty.

“smart” to turn an olive-branch into a laurel branch; the more so, as
laurels may be cultivated from suckers.

“St. Stephen's doors are opened wide;

And listens, with an ear resigned—
The Ex-Ministere hath his will.
SIR RUPERT he sat there with a groan;
He cannot choose but hear,
As thus Fº on that meager man,
The Whig Ex-Ministere:
“The Ins were cheered, the Outs were queered;
Merrily did we stop
A question here, a motion there;
Nor Estimates need lop.

And as for BRIGHT, when he showed fight,

“Now MR. B–LL—E came, and he
Got up a case so strong;
And then L–KE K—NG, he had his fling
The county votes among.
“And, to the pressure forced to bow,
came out with a sort of vow,
That, if they’d not insist on't now,
But put his Bill to bed,
The Session past, I’d give at last,
My own Reform instead.
“The country, though, why I don't know,
Seemed to grow wondrous cold;
And that was why I º I’d try
That Durham letter bold.
“It was my drift to get a lift
By help of Church and QUEEN;
But wisest men will, now and then,
Go down two stools between.
“The Pope was here; the Church was there;
Dissent was all around;
And Ireland growled, and Maynooth howled,
And we got quite aground.
“Then I must own, LoRD P-LM—RST-N
Unto our succour came;
If he sometimes put us in the hole,
He oftener play'd our game.
“He cheer'd our friends—our foes he met;
Gave dinners, soirées too;
Heal’d many a split, made many a hit;
In fact, he pull'd us through.
“When words and wind I couldn't find,
LoRD P-LM—RST-N would follow;
And rattling away, half grave, half gay,
Carried many a question hollow.
“In storm and cloud, uncheck'd, uncow'd,
He aye maintain'd our line:
And still show'd fight night after night,
When I thought we must resign.”
“Now, save thee, ancient Ministere,
What means that bitter groan?
Why look'st thou so?” “Remorse and woeſ

A SNOB IN THE INSOLVENT COURT.
The Courts of Bankruptcy and Insolvency afford to the gentlemen
who preside in them numerous opportunities for visiting poverty and
misfortune. with that contumely which a lofty sense of affluence and
respectability entertains for those meannesses. It is not often, how:
ever, that the gentlemen in question avail themselves of the chance of
thus reading the unlucky and the indigent a moral lesson. In the
following brief report, however, given by the Morning Post, of a case
which occurred the other day in the Insolvent Debtors' Court, it will
be seen that one Commissioner at least, meeting with such an occasion,
did not fail to improve it.
“INSOLVENT DEBTORS' COURT. MARCH 3.
“(Before the CHIEF CommissionER.)
“‘AN Assist ANT."—A respectable-looking young man applied, under the Protection
Act, to be relieved from a few debts.
“The CHIEF CommissionER asked him who he was 2
“The Insolvent said–A hosier's assistant.
“CHIEF CommissionER—A what?
“Insolvent—An assistant, Sir.
“CHIEF CoMMIssion ER–How grand you are 1 I suppose you sell stockings behind
a counter?
“Insolvent—Yes, Sir, and other things.
“CHIEV CommissionER—Then you are a ‘shopman.'
“The Insolvent acknowledged that he was a shopman.
“The CommissionER named a day ſor the final order.”
It is very true that “assistant” is the term commonly applied to a
young man serving in a hosier's or linen-draper's shop. But it is much
too genteel a designation for a º wretch who sells stockings
behind a counter, and besides is reduced to the shameful necessity of
ing the benefit of the Insolvent Act. It was natural that the Com-
missioner, with the feelings of a statutable gentleman, should exclaim,
“How grand you are : " on hearing such a fellow describe himself by
so decent a name. Indeed, even “shopman” is a title more dignified
than ought to be conferred on a contemptible pauper that comes up to |
be whitewashed, ºf been, antecedently, in a situation so sufficiently
disgraceful as that of a hosier's servant. The only wonder is, that
MR. ChIEF CoMMIssion ER did not insist on this despicable individual's
“acknowledging” himself to be a “counter jumper.”

THE WELLINGTON STATUE AND THE
QUARTERN LOAF.
ROM mischance, a
contemplative phi-
losophy extracts
wisdom, even as
chemistry obtains
medicine from poi-
sons. Thus con-
sidered, sweet and
comforting are the
uses of that ugly
y lump of bronze,
christened at the
foundry, the Wel-
lington Statue, on
the Rutland Arch
– outragin the
nations. imple,
guileless, blunder.
headed BULL-aſter much ges-
ticulation, much vehement stamp-
ing of double soled top-boots,
much thundering denunciation of
the projected site for the Ugliness
T-was won into sullen consent that
the thing should have a proba-
tionary trial.
. ... My good fellow, why all this
- indignation ? Only suffer us to put
up the statue, and if it is proved to be an eyesore, why, my dear, good
creature, can’t we take it down it. 22
... Well, but,” says BULL, “will you take it down again?”
‘....Will we take it down again?' My dear fellow, what a question!
Will we take it down again? What a question {-Öf course we’ll take
it down again.”
“Well, then, I–but it’s only for a trial, you know?”—
“Oh, only a trial—Honour!” -
Up goes the statue; and BULL, chuckling, cries—“There, I knew it
-I said so. Can anything be more ugly P No more life in the metal
than in a coffin-plate. I told you so. But you've had your trial, and now
—when–I, say when are you going to take the statue down again?”
“Take the statue down, MR. BULL **
“Yes, take it down? ... You know you said you would—the trial
was all upon honour, you know. And I ask you once and for all, when
are you going to take the monster down again?”
“MR. BULL, does it not strike you, that to remove the statue of the
Noble Duke and his generous war-horse, would be nothing more than
an insult—a ceremonious insult—to the exalted inhabitant of Apsley
House?. Can you, MR. BULL, pretend to enter into the feelings of
disgust, indignation, and amazement of that illustrious man, when,
about to shave himself at daybreak, he looks forth from his dressing:
room window, and first sees the effigy—his metallic other self abased,
removed, or as you coarsely word it,º-taken down 2"
“Well, but you know you said—”
“Don’t talk nonsense, MR. BULL! My good man, your brain must
be softening. I ask you—ha! hal—could NAPOLEoN himself take the
Duke down?, Shall we, then P”
“Fiddlestick! NApoleon's nothing fo do with the question. You
said the thing should come down if——
“Come down. The Duke come down! Badajoz–Wittoria—Sala-
manca–Torres Wedras–Waterloo, and—and the Duke come down!”
“Then you will not remove?”—
“Yes, we will: we'll remove the scaffolding to-morrow. But, as
for the statue, we’ve got it up, and—you'll pardon the joke, Mr. Bull
—and up it remains.”
And so, people of England, is it with the DERby Ministry. We are
told not to press the question of Free Trade upon them: we are
advised just to let them have a trial. People of England, we say no.
At, once bring the question to issue. Be instructed by that uplifted
Ugliness at Hyde Park Corner—that, deformity that experience may
still convert into a Mentor—and admit of no delay. As with the
bronze, so will it be with the bread. Let the DERby Ministry once
get up the quartern loaf, and, like the Hyde Park metal-up it will
remain.
Money Market and City Nonsense.
MonTED, men say, that considering the present state of affairs in
France, it is a comfort to them to see that the French funds exert a
favourable influence on our Three Per Cents; but surely this is a
deceitful consol—ation.
NEW SONG OF THE HEART,
FOR YOUNG LADIES.
SoMEBony has published a new ballad, called “Wilt Thou Linger
Near Me?” Somebody else has produced another, under the title of
‘. Hither Come.” In drawing-room vocal music there is a general ten-
dency to glorify the feeling of sympathy. Something too much of this.
A wholesome antipathy—even sentimentally considered—is a laudable
affection in its way: a salutary corrective of the softer emotions: a fine
prophylactic for young ladies against foreign counts, and other adven-
turers. “Rise,” then, “honest Muse, and sing”—just for a change-
somewhat in the antipathetic vein. Instead of “Hither Come,” let the
canticle be, for example—
WILT THOU BE OFF P
Wilt thou be off? I know thou comest
Because thou thinkest Papa hath cash;
In talking sweet thou only hummest:
Thy Prºg speeches are simply trash,
allala, lalla! Fiddle de deel
Falla, &c.
Tease me no more! I tell thee plainly,
That I see through thee—yes, through and through;
Come, nonsense! thou dost wheedle vainly;
It will not do; no, it will not do
Fallala, lalla! Fiddle de dee! &c.
There, go along—’tis no use looking
So sentimental as that at me; , .
Get thee away! elsewhere of hookin
A softer maid there a chance may be.
Fallala, lalla! Fiddle de dee! &c.
AN EDITOR AT A DISCOUNT.
THE Protectionists advertised the other day for, an Editor for a
Protectionist Paper, who was to receive, by way of “ º to begin
with, fifty pounds per annum.” It is all very well to offer hy pounds
a-year to “begin with;” but it is obvious, that to “go on with such
a salary would be quite impossible. As his duties would call upon him
to write in favour of dear Corn, he would be actually working to take
the bread out of his own mouth; for if he succeeded in writing up the
quartern loaf to its former price, he would be obliged to accept half a
loaf instead of a whole one. We do not question the sufficiency of the
salary, as times go; for the intellect that would undertake to advocate
Protectionist principles, would, perhaps, be *::: valued at one
pound per week, or fifty pounds per annum. No one with sufficient
sense to qualify, him for a railway portership, or a light suburban
beadledom, would condescend to the situation of a Protectionist Editor;
and we think it, therefore, unfair of any one to complain of the salary
being inadequate to the article required.
MANCHESTER AND THE MINISTRY.
THE LORD CHANCELLOR sits upon a woolsack. The Manchester
League, improving upon this historical fact, has sent a seat to the
EARL of DERBY, to be used by the Premier at Cabinet. Councils.
The seat is of a peculiar significance of material, illustrative of the
probable short, yet timely, fate of the DERby Ministry. We give a
very reduced cut of the present.
A Joke Craftily Qualified.
THE danger of abolishing the property qualification for Members of
Parliament is this, that if some of our legislators were to be without
*: property qualification, they would have no other qualification
whatever.

A SHAMEFUL CASE OF PIRACY.
(To the Editor of PUNCH.)
oRTHY SIR,--"I AM
the Manager of the
Marionnette Theatre.
Loath as I am to leave
my little family of
Woods (almost as
many as there were
in the RUssell, Ad-
ministration), I am
compelled, in self-de-
fence, to appear before
the Curtain, and to
make that appeal to a
British Public, which,
when a Manager makes
it, is never made in
vain.
“I have a serious
charge (and a Mana-
ger's charges, I can
tell you, Sir, are very
serious things) to
make against the EARL
of DERBy. I delibe.
rately accuse the pre-
Fent Prime Minister
of England of wilfully
plagiarising my idea of
the “Marionnettes.' I
call upon any one, who
has the smallest know-
- ledge of puppets, to
run his eye down the list of the New Ministry, and to say, with his, hard upon his heart,
* my idea of the Marionnettes has not been shamefully stolen for the formation
or it
“Let us take the puppets, one by one—let us separate this Protectionist Bundle of Sticks-
and, laying them separately on our knee, test their soundness for office.
“There is the EARL or LoNspale, a diamond-coronetted Marionnette of the very first
water. I have just such a Nobleman, in my Establishment (which I º: will come
and see), which cost me, diamonds and all, exactly 15s. 6d, and which, if the EARL or DeRºy
had asked me, he might have had, at a small advance upon the prime cost. I am sure he
would do the work of Lord President just as well as the EARL or Lonsdale, and, probably,
much better—for he doesn't speak.
“The next Marionnette is LoRD MALMESBURY (another Lord!). He is Secretary for
Foreign Affairs; and, coming after PALMERston—and even GRANyIILE-I must say he
shines as a Marionnette of the very smallest dimensions. I wouldn't have him at any price.
“MR. WALPole is another. #
personally, and I am told he is a very good barrister; and, as such, I should dress him ". ld
a black gown, with a horse-hair wig, and send him on, with a roll of papers in his hand. But
though that may be applauded at my little Theatre, and might gö down tolerably well,
with a few set speeches about the ‘British Lion,’ ‘Britannia,' and the ‘Sun that never
sets...&c., I doubt if it is sufficient to constitute a Home Secretary!
“Then there is Lord John MANNERs. . Another Lord!. It would really seem as if the
Ministry had been compounded out of that “old Nobility,” for which his Lordship prayed
that Wealth, Commerce, and ºf in the country might die first, sooner than it should
be taken away from us! LoRD John is the Marionnette of the Woods and Forests; and
he may have a sympathy for them, as the material of which he is made may, probably,
have been selected from those very domains. Of his Lordship, in private life, I know less
than any one of the posts he has controul, over in Hyde Park; but I am told he is a
talented young pupil, of the Young º School—where little boys, from the ages of
forty to fifty-five inclusive, are educated at so much a quarter, with something extra, I
suppº for ‘MANNERs.”
"Of Mr. Disnagir I had, rather not, speak. I am told he has been connected with the
Press; and, as I entertain, the profoundest respect for all ‘the gentlemen of the Press,' I
think'it will only be ſºlº to hold my tongue about his faults, if a ‘gentleman of
the Press’ can have any. But thi
that MR. DISRAELI is, also, a literary Gent. To prove
common with others, of his brilliant talents, I shall he happ to engage him to write pieces
for my establishment; or, if he will come and do the talking behind the scenes, (and I’m told
he talks very cleverly), I will promise to give him his own terms.
“But, what are we to say of the Duke of North UMBERLAND for the First Lord of the
A.;? There's a fine Marionnette for you! Why, I doubt if he can even dance the
ornpipe
“Or what can we advance in favour of LoRD HARDwicke (another Lord!) for the Post
Office? Another Marionnette of the very softest wood, scarcely qualified to do the work of
anything so hard as the Post.
“And last, not least, comes SIR John PAKINGTON, a fine country Marionnette, such as
we generally dress up with a white waistcoat, a red face, a large bunch of seals, and top-
boots. He has the management of the forty-four Colonies of England; and I cannot make
out what they have done to deserve so severe a punishment!
“There are several other Marionnettes-dummies of the fine old Conservative model; but,
2= -
/ . º º
- º -
then, the high sense I entertain, in
e is Home Secretary. I know nothing of MR. Wºº #
T
s much I consider myself at liberty to say,+I am informed
|Sir, I think I have said enough to prove the
shameful case of piracy that has been committed
upon my property. I have spent hundreds to
bring it to perfection; and what for f-merely
to enable Lord DERBY to come and pilfer my
perfected designs!
“But I shall yet be revenged ' When Lord
DERBY begins to pull the strings of his puppets,
he will find how difficult º are to manage.
They will be kicking right and left—some will
falling, others, will be completely doubled up—
and he will only be glad to call in my assistance
to keep them on their º
“It is very clear two Marionnette Exhibitions
cannot exist, to be properly º: in the
same metropolis. Mine was the first in the field,
and has already enjoyed the confidence of the
public for two months. LoRD DERBY's has been
only a fortnight before the town, and has never
enjoyed the confidence of the public a, single
minute. London, large as it is, is not large
enough to support two companies of Marion-
nettes. Therefore, either LoBD DERby must
retire, or else I must . I leave it to a generous
and discriminating British Public (to which a
British Manager never appeals in vain) to decide
which
“I remain, Sir,
“Strong in the consciousness of a just cause,
“Your very ill-used Servant,
“THE MANAGER of THE MARIon NETTEs.
“P.S.. To prove I bear no malice, if LoRD
DERBY likes to make me an offer to combine his
Marionnettes with mine, I shall be very happy
to entertain his proposal. The seat of power,
of course, to be transferred to the Lowther
Arcade l’”
FABLES FOR THE PROTECTIONISTS.
The Countryman and the Snake.
AN Agriculturist, one day,
A Snake encountered on the way;
The creature lay upon the ground,
In dull and torpid stupor bound.
It seem'd incompetent, in fact,
To make a motion or to act;
'Twas brought completely to a stand,
pe of a burden on the land.
e Agriculturist, at length,
Desired to give the creature strength;
So took it up and fondly press'd
The Snake to his ºf breast.
At length, in an unlucky hour,
The creature was restored to power,
And acting an appropriate part,
Stung the confiding rustic's heart,
“Is this your gratitude P-Oh fie!”
Was then the Agriculturist's cry;
“I succour'd you, and you should learn
To give protection in return.
Take this,”—and as the word he said,
He knock'd the creature on the head;
The Snake, for mercy vainly cried,
Essay’d to sting, and, hissing, died.

Alarming Intelligence.
A NEwsPAPER paragraph announces that
“MR. WILLIAM Fagan, in his address to the constituents
of the county of Cork, says that he shall always be found
fighting by the side of SHARMAN Chawroad.”
What are MR. FAGAN's ...}} because
when one Irish gentleman talks of fighting by the
side of another Irish gentleman, his words are
calculated to create terror and alarm in the
minds of HER MAJESTY's English subjects, and
to cause anxiety that he should be bound over
to keep the peace, until, we know what the
son of Erin means—whether politics or pistols
it is.

PROTECTION OF OLD ENGLAND BY YOUNG ENGLAND.
oRD JoHN MANNERs, very pro-
perly going backward for
great precedents and deter-
mining to show the country
that he is learned in other
matters than the old forest
laws, is about to call the
attention of the House of
Commons to along-neglected
statute of Edward THE
THIRD, which
bellarii, or Hoblers, for the
Cinque Ports. These efficient
but too long neglected men
are, according to Cowell,
“tyed by tenure to maintain
a little nagge, for the certi-
fying of any invasion made
by enemies or such like perils
toward the sea.” We have,
to be sure, the electric tele-
- graph; but there lingers an
air of the picturesque about
the Hobellarii on their “little nagges” that must be dear to the
atriotic heart throbbing beneath the white waistcoat of Young
ºngland. His Lordship, further intends to move for a correct return
of the number of English bowmen at Agincourt, with a view to the
re-organisation of that heroic force, the archery of the olden time.
Yew-trees may be said to be looking up. We further understand that
this revived means of protecting the country, will come into force
simultaneously with the revived Corn Laws. Then, Protection will be
complete.
THE SALE AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
WHEN we saw the auctioneer's placards desecrating the crystal, or
rather staining the glass, of the Great Exhibition building, we felt a
sort of curdling of the blood—a kind of figurative conversion of it into
cold cream—at the idea of our pet palace being besieged by the broad-
sides of the bill-sticker. When we observed the word MATERIALs, in
gigantic letters, announced to be knocked down by the hammer of the
auctioneer, we thought the..". were ninny-hammers themselves for
not protesting against the sad sacrifice. - -
On attending the sale, we discovered that the materials are, in fact,
the mere immaterials used as the temporary fittings-up, and that we put
a wrong construction on the word “materials,” when we supposed it to
mean i. iron and glass used in the construction of the building. On
our entrance, we found it was like looking for the point of a needle in a
magnum of hay, to search for the auctioneer in the vast area of the
Crystal Palace. After having taken a walk of some four or five miles
in the course of an exploring expedition, we thought we saw signs of
habitation in a small patch of land to the south-west of the Transept,
and on our nearing the spot, we fancied we heard the sound of a
human voice. Presently, the familiar words, “Going—going!” struck
upon our ear, and we found ourselves on the outskirts of a small group
of human beings, one of whom was raised on a small platform on wheels,
horsed by a bricklayer's labourer, and dragged about from lot to lot,
with a small gang of bidders dangling after it. Upon our going into the
select circle, the auctioneer had just drawn up opposite a small pile of
deal-boards, and was in, the midst of an eloquent oration over the
“stack of useful wood” that lay before him.
After entreating for some minutes a price for the “useful wood,”
and asking, almost in despair, if “nobody would bid?” a spirited
speculator offered a few shillings, and, without much competition,
became the purchaser. The labourer who horsed the platform, then
jogged on to the next lot, which was “another stack of useful wood; ”
and this being disposed of, he proceeded in a sort of lazy trot to “the
next station,” which proved to be the interesting locality of “28 boards,
various.” The variet presented nothing very charming; and, as the
catalogue consisted of several pages of “ditto,” weleſt the little group
of bidders to join the large majority, who were scattered about at
different points for the purpose of admiring the building.
The sale itself attracted the few, while the salle in which the sale
was held, formed the real object of interest. Now and then a passing
lady, hearing the words “valuable beading” drop from the lips of the
auctioneer, made a random bid, with the vague idea that the “beading”
might turn out to be a very valuable necklace; and, in one instance,
a misguided female purchased “ten triangular painted sashes,” under
the #. that she had got a cheap lot of handsome ribbon.

GREEN PEA SOUP.
AIR-" The Ivy Green.”
OH!, a splendid Soup is the true Pea Green ;
I for it often call;
And up it comes in a smart tureen,
When I dine in my banquet hall.
When a leg of mutton at home is boil'd,
The liquor I always keep,
And in that liquor (before 'tis spoil'd)
A peck of peas I steep.
When boil'd till tender they have been,
I rub through a sieve the peas so green.
Though the trouble the indolent may shock,
I rub with all my power;
And having return'd them to the stock,
I stew them for more than an hour:
Then of younger peas I take some more,
The mixture to improve
Thrown in a little time before
The soup from the fire I move.
Then seldom a better soup is seen,
Than the old familiar soup Pea Green.
Since first I began my household career
How many my dishes have been
But the one that digestion never need fear,
Is the simple old soup Pea Green.
The giblet may tire, the gravy pall,
And the turtle lose its charm;
But the Green Pea triumphs over them all,
And does not the slightest harm.
Smoking hot in a smart tureen,
A rare old soup is the true Pea Green!
LATIN FOR LAWYERS.
In the Court of Bankruptcy, the other day, MR. CoMMIssionER
Goulbur N. made a remark of a degree of importance sufficient to
require at least our attention. MR. MURRAY, who appeared for the
assignees in a certain case, said that the affairs of the 'º. On a
particular day,
“Were transferred to the official assignee, and without the slightest trouble on the
part of that officer, £17,329 2s. 6d. were placed in his hands.”
Th; CoMMIssionER.—“The whole of the amount, uno flatu, as it
Were.”
There is a deep meaning in this. Flatus is a strong expression. Uno
ſlatu, at one puff, or one blast. Thus either the fatal facility, or the
destructive ruthlessness, with which the law effects a transfer of
property, is suggested; though whether it was the one or the other
the learned Commissioner had in view, we don't know. We say,
learned Commissioner, advisedly; because those who know nothing of
the law but its Latin, might imagine that he said uno “flatu,” for uno
“ictu,” meaning, “at one blow.” Quod foret, as a modern Classic
remarks, canis Latinus pessimae descriptionis.
A CLANDESTINE PARLIAMENT.
It is rumoured that Louis NAPOLEoN intends to decree that the
meetings of the new French Legislative Assembly shall take place in
the open air, as the North American Indians hold a Palaver. The
scene suggested, for their deliberations is the plain of Satory, where
the PRESIDENT laid the foundation of his present authority with cham-
pagne and sayeloys. A cordon of troops will keep the people several
hundred yards' distance from the debates: so that not a syllable of
their discussions, beyond the reports authorised by the Government
will transpire. The reason which has dictated this somewhat novel
arrangement is, the danger of publicity which would be incurred if the
Assembly were to meet in any hall or chamber: for there cannot be
rooms without walls; and walls, proverbial wisdom has informed
MR. BonAPARTE, have ears.
A Shaky Condition.
IT, is not to be wondered at that the Pope feels his position, to be
anything but firm; for, instead of his having been fixed in his place b
real Roman Cement, he has been merely dabbed down where he is wit
a little Plaster of Paris.

In a notice of MR. Huc's Souvenirs d'un

mention is made by Blackwood of an extra-
ordinary mode of salutation practised by the

“It consists in uncovering the head, stretching out the

operations are performed simultaneously.”

serious complaisance, by making faces in this

THE CHEAP LAW DELUSION.
CHEAP law turns out to be a mere hoax, after all, and the County
Courts are nothing more than so many mockeries, delusions, and snares;
for, though nominally the costs are limited, they are in reality as exor-
bitant as ever. The County Court Judges can only order a moderate
sum to the lawyers; but these harpies may drag their victims into
Westminster Hall, for the purposes of plunder, and bring actions there
for costs to any amount, incurred in proceedings before the inferior
tribunals. ---
The wretched litigant is lured, by the exhibition of a cheap tariff,
into a County Court; but when he thinks he has paid his bill, according
to the moderate scale set before him, he may be pounced upon, and
hurried off to the Queen's Bench, Common Pleas, or Exchequer, where
he will learn that the lawyers have not half done with him, and don’t
mean to let him off so cheaply as he supposed. We have heard a good
deal of the ticketing system in certain swindling shops, where an article
is marked in the window at a low price, as a bait to the unwary, who,
when he once gets into the clutches of the fraudulent gang, is not
. to get out again until he has been plundered to a serious
txtent.
Such is the use that—contrary to the intention of the legislature
—the lawyers seem to be making of the County Courts. These
establishments have been opened with an assortment of cheap law pro-
ceedings, and the practitioners attract customers by inviting the latter to
“Look here ! a complete suit for two guineas.” Many of the public are
thus induced to É. in for the purpose of permitting their legal measures
to be taken at what º believe to be a fair and moderate price. No
sooner, however, have they been suited or non-suited, as the case may
be, than they are hurried through a back door, into the great monster
concern in Westminster Hall, where the same suit is “tried on ”,again,
and instead of the moderate price ticketed up in the minor place of
business, all the old exorbitant demands—that have been the scandal
of the profession for ages—are found to be in full force; there we are
called upon to submit to the monstrous imposition . known as
“Costs as between attorney and client,” which might as well be called
“claims as between wolf and lamb.”
Here the client finds that every note he has written blaming his attorney
for inattention or needless delay, which has elicited a common-place
shuffling reply, has exposed him to a series of charges of three-and-
aixpence for each epistle; and then it is that he comes resolutely to the
determination—which is the real cause of the ruin of the attorneys—
that sooner than submit to so much fraud and imposition, he will never
have anything to do with any lawyer again. If these people would
conduct matters fairly and honestly, the public would not be so much
afraid to deal with them, and the amount of employment for them
would be much greater; but under the present system, every one feels
that in going to any attorney, he runs the risk of dealing—in ninety-
nine cases out of a hundred—with a man who will dishonourably make
costs. Upon this species of plunder, the County Courts were intended
as a check; but now that it has been decided that costs to any amount may
be recovered in Westminster Hall, and that the law which was sup
to limit them is a dead letter, the work of Law Reform has to be done
all over again. We therefore call upon our old friend, BROUGHAM,
“Do it—nor leave the task to us.”
THE BLACK HOLE AT EDMONTON.
THE good British Public's olfactory nerves
Have scarcely recover'd from “GoldNER's Preserves,”
When Edmonton pauper-school's horrors disclose
A worse mess to the moral and physical nose.

We have more than the Tooting case over again;
Such a den we no Infant Asylum will call
But a youth's Pandemonium—Depravity Hall.
You may try to clean out this detestable hole,
Where the Strand Union children rot, body and soul;
But not much you’ll effect, to the plan whilst you keep,
Of providing for paupers so monstrously cheap.
What’s good will bear its price—education or beeſ,
Or medical science for parish relief:
If you pay a low figure you’ll get an ill smell;
For a bargain dirt cheap, must be nasty as well.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAIRI 115
ONE of our Foreign Correspondents, who, being never at home, is almost always out, has
sent us the following:—
- Quite at Sea, March 6!h.
Having been engaged in a search for another Hippopotamus, or Sea-Horse, and being on
the look-out, therefore, for mares' nests, I was º in the rather Pacific Ocean of
politics, by a cry of “White water!” I immediately perceived a few empty bubbles on the
surface; and knowing there was nothing in them, I expected them to subside, when a native,
named Jack Russell, who had been for some time at the helm, cried out, “Look! look!
Me see too much too much Me no see all dat feller, me 'fraid!”
Upon this he suddenly abandoned his post, though I told him it was a mere nothing he was
frightened at ; but he still Persisted, exclaiming, “Dat feller!—too big me 'fraid!” and he
would not be persuaded to “stand by ” any longer. At length 1 discovered the object of his
alarm, which consisted of a heavy, but apparently feeble, body, with a head of astounding
thickness, and a tail that made as much stir and commotion as possible, by wagging itself
about * furiously, as if to urge on the head, which showed signs of being reluctant to
proceed.
Watching it narrowly, I saw that the body and tail were so cumbersome, that they
threatened to drag down the head, which could only by the greatest effort—and by rising up
superior to the rest of the body—keep itself above water.
t soon became obvious that the Protectionist Sea-Serpent had made its appearance; and
RICHARD Cobden, the mate of the Free-trader—which happened to come alongside—began
urging his companions, with all his eloquence, to have “a try at the fellow,” and dispose of
the Serpent off-hand. Let me say, to their credit, that every one got ready for the enter-
prise, except a few, who were for giving the creature time to show whether he intended
making an attack.
Seeing the preparations that were being made, the Serpent tried to get away by a side
wind, and stood off, expecting, no doubt, to be lost sight of for a time, with a view of playing
us a masty trick when we might be off our guard. It was, nevertheless, determined among us
that we shoud go after the creature, which made some uncertain motions with its head, as if it
would make us believe that it intended turning round. Some were inclined to hesitate, but
Richard Cobden, having launched the League Boat, sprung aboard, and hurled at once one of
his powerful harpoons, which stuck like a tremendous thorn in the creature's side. The effect
was instantaneous, for the Serpent seemed to go down very rapidly; and a great effort was then
.*. keep the creature down, by getting together as much weight as possible; and

Several pointed weapons were now used against the animal's body; but its obtuseness was
such as to render it difficult to make any impression whatever, though the head seemed to
have some sensibility, and would have got away, but for the furious lashings it experienced
from its own tail. At length all motion appeared to cease. The head began to knock gradually
under; and a shout of “Protection’s dead,” announced the fact, that further annoyance
from the monster was impossible.
As the creature lay lifeless on the surface of the sea of politics, I was enabled to take the
following description of a curiosity, which may soon be considered as extinct. Its head was
remarkable for much heavy irregular jaw, and its tail, which was much disjointed, was perfectly
obtuse, without coming to any point at all. The body was party-coloured, and one side did not
at all agree with the other, while there were indications of much blubber having been given
forth. Its head was well adapted for sending forth columns of fluent mater, and it had the

facility of spouting—very like a whale. It had
several paws, which it had a tendency to lay on
everything it came near; and the head, upon
close examination, proved extremely offensive,
having got into very bad odour in a very short
space of time.

For cheap beef and moderate twistes?

Or the League will lick you hollow.
Schooling for Squires.
PRotectionist country gentlemen may, in an
abridgment of some History of England, have
read, when they were at school, how ALFRED
divided his loaf with the beggar. History is
“ philosophy teaching by example; ” but its les-
sons are generally warnings, showing rather what
ought to be avoided, than what should be done.
In this point of view our squires seem to regard
the conduct of ALFRED: for, in wanting to
compel the poor man to share his loaf with
them, their own behaviour is precisely the
reverse.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
INTOLERANCE AT AYLESBURY IN PARTICULAR, AND EVERYWHERE
ELSE IN GENERAL.
IN order to judge properly of the conduct of the HIGH SHERIFF of BUCKINGHAMSHIRE,
in placing his own spiritual director in the position of Chaplain to the Judges, it is
necessary to have correct notions of religious toleration. The following remarks on that
subject are submitted to the Fathers of the Oratory: and we should be glad if the reverend
gentlemen would inform us whether they do, or not, express an orthodox view of it.
Religious toleration is the toleration of religion. But heresy is not religion; heresies are
simply superstitions, misbeliefs, and impieties. Therefore, the toleration of heresy is not the
toleration of religion. There is only one true religion: that is, there is no religion but one:
the other so-called religions are false: in other words, no religions at all. The one only
religion is the Roman Catholic. It is impossible, in the nature of things, to tolerate any
other system claiming to be a religion than that. Roman Catholics, in tolerating Protestants,
merely connive at the propagation of false doctrines. Protestants, in tolerating one another,
only exercise forbearance towards each other's mutual delusions. It is only when they
tolerate Roman Catholics that they practise, religious toleration. But toleration is not
complete, unless it permits religion to be fully carried out. Religion, meaning always the
Roman Catholic religion, cannot be carried out unless its clergy are allowed to preach
whatever they think proper, and the laity to practise what they preach, unrestrained § any
other authority than that of the ecclesiastical power; in fine, of the Pope.
Corollaries:–
1. Religious toleration required the LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE to allow MR. Scott MURRAY
to do honour to the only true Church, in placing his Roman Catholic Chaplain by the side
of the Judges, and on the Bench,
2. Religious toleration did not require MR. Scott MURRAY to pay any regard to Lord
CAMPBELL's Protestant opinions, or prejudices.
3. Epitomised in one word: INQUIsition |

THE NEW “PEN”. TREATY WITH THE AMERICANS.
“It was the intention of the Government, after this bill of [International Copyright between England and
France] had become law, to communicate it to other countries, and especially America, and again urge nego-
tiations with a view to a satisfactory arrangement.”—Parliamentary Debates.

arrived at Washington for the purpose of exe-
cuting an international Treaty of Literary Peace
and Probity between the nations, the ceremony
took place, with becoming care and gravity, in
front of the Senate-house. At an early hour the
chiefs of all the tribes of the publishing wig-
wams of the States were upon the ground. The
ScALPEMs, the GRIN DEMs, the LIKE-BELLows-
PUFFERs, the FLAY-EM-AND-EAT-EMs, the BRAIN-
sucKERs, the HARPIEs (or HARPERs), the GREEN-
PEABODIEs, and the BLUEBEAN-NoboDIEs were
all present in the persons of their chiefs, or of
delegates from the tribes.
The savages — (although all of them Pub-
LisH-URs)—comported themselves with a decency
and seriousness scarcely to be expected from
unsophisticated children of woods and covers.
They were all of them en grande tenue; their
faces, breasts, and arms, painted, with various
arithmetical figures in printer's ink. Nearly all
of them wore trophies depending from their
necks; namely, Fº books, brass-clasped, and
bound in, what appeared to us, the skins of
authors; but º we were assured by what
seemed a conscientious native, was American
racoon. “At least,” pleaded our informant pathe-
tically, “at least, allow us our own binding”
MR. CoMMIssionER PEN, in his fullest feather,
(with true literary punctuality) was upon the
ground at the appointed minute. . (For when did
PEN ever disappoint the most º: PUB-
LisH-URF) MR.PEN, bending gracefully as plume
of peacock, and with like metallic brightness of
eye, saluted the meeting.
The savages gave a low, and as it seemed to
us a sullen, note of welcome; whilst more than
one old PUB-Lish-UR, cocking his eye at PEN,
smacked his lips as though he could eat him.

(“Ho! ho! ho!” growled and chuckled the
multitude; the affectionateness of the greeting
being too much even for the savage simplicity
of PUB-Lish-URs.—“Ho! ho! ho!”)
“Yes, my children,” repeated PEN, by no means
abashed; PEN, being when so minded, terribly in
earnest. “I say, my children, for what would
PUB-Lish-URs be without PENs?. My children
have beheld the porcupine in his down – the
sparrow-hawk in his nestling nakedness. And
is not that baby porcupine, a poor pigling with-
out quills—that, sparrow-hawk a helpless, ugly
voracity, until clothed with feathers? Even as
the pigling porcupine—as the naked, gaping
sparrow-hawk — even so is the PUB-Lish-UR

“Speak, father,” cried a Chief; “speak, the

a spirit that takes account of the doings of even
PUB-Lish-URs, should no longer hold the nose at
you, even as at the carrion that draws down the
vulture l’”
“Spirit of Right,” said a HARPY, “what Spirit
is that ?” and the old Chief shook his head, as
one perplexed.
“Hear me, ye PUB-Lish-URs of the New
World! Ye benighted children of darkness!
Listen, for what I say is taken down in big
book—and what you do is taken down in big
book, too—bigger book than all that ”—and here
PEN pointed to the Senate-House. “The Great
§. has blessed you with the words, of the
white Saxon; your mothers sang to you the same
songs; and when you asked for bread-and-butter
at the knee of your grandam, the Great Spirit
put into your mouths the same words that the
white Saxons speak across the big Salt Lake.”
t “It is true,” said a PRIG-Octavo. “It is
rue.”
“And of these words,” cried PEN, becoming
animated, “of these words you have made cords
to bind your Saxon brothers—of these words

“Rob!” exclaimed a chief. “The Bolt-Books are not thieves.”
“Hear me,” cried PEN., “Listen; and let shame steal upon your
faces, making them red as the autumn sumach. Hear me, PUB-Lish-URs
of the New World. You have robbed, and you still rob our English
Hunters. Your flesh is fed with priggery, and you sleep in the
blankets of rapine. You have smeared yourselves with the tº, of
the innocent; and you have bruised the bones and picked out the
marrow of good men without guile.” (Here PEN coughed and took
breath.)
“Speak: more words,” cried an old chief, a LIKE-BELLows-
PUFFER.
“You have robbed”—said PEN-" and rob our English hunters.
They hunt in the fields of letters, and you steal their game; they have
the toil, and you have the plunder. The Great Spirit of Right is angry
with you, my children; and I am here that º should bury the scissors,
and exchange the wanipum with our English Hunters.”
Hereupon a venerable chief, GREENPEABODY, rose and said:
“Father PEN, you have melted our hearts into paste; and shame is
upon us. We have robbed the Saxon hunters; day and night they
have followed the game in the hunting-grounds of letters, and we have
been as thieves—and no better, my Father. The Great Spirit of
Right is offended with us; and we will bury the scissors, and exchange | º
the warmpum belt, and we will hereafter buy at a fair price the game
of º hunters, hunted in the fields of letters beyond the Big

Other chiefs followed GREENPEABODY, and all for their tribes bound
themselves to bury the scissors and exchange the wanpum belt.
After this a solemn feast was held. A mighty bowl of ink—of
mixed English and Arnerican ink, expressly concocted without gall-
nuts—was produced to the harmonious sound of music. MR. CoM-
MissionER PEN took the first deep dip of ink: all the Chiefs and
Delegates then º: of the black fluid—the wine of peace. And
then the Chiefs buried each his scissors; and wampum belts, were

Tell it to the Marines :
In the extremely modest account CAPTAIN SEABURY gives us of his
recent capture of the Great Sea Serpent, a somewhat unnecessary stress
is laid upon the fact (?) of “his Snakeship’s” likeness being taken “by
a Scotchman.” We have no wish to appear unreasonably incredulous,
but the first betting man of our acquaintance we chance to meet, we
shall certainly ask him, what are the odds that they have neither
“Scotched the snake,” nor killed it * - -
It is also stated, that in cutting up “his Snakeship,” the body was
found “covered with blubber, like a whale.” Yes, exactly, we should
think so. Wery like a whale!
THE UNKINDEST CUT OF ALL.
THE EARL of DER BY coolly refers the cause of Free Trade versus
Protection to be settled by the Arbitration of “the intelligent portion
of the community.” . Now, this is really too bad: for, of course, it is
virtually excluding his friends, the (oratorically) Distressed Agricul-
turists, from having any voice at all in the decision.
Agonising Difficulty.
THE feeling heart must sympathise with the electors of St. Alban's.
If Parliament should be dissolved without having disfranchised them,
they will be placed in a very painful dilemma. With a view to save
themselves from disfranchisement, they will have to make love either
to the Protectionists or to the Whigs:–and the difficulty of foretelling
which of the two parties the next election will establish in power, will ||W
render their choice of a fit and proper representative as difficult a
matter as the decision of the celebrated ass between the two haystacks.

MAGISTRATES IN CHANCERY.
No one seems to be safe from the fangs of Chancery, which pounces
on every age and every station; seizes on the infant in the cradle, and
has lº, laid its clutches upon a pair of astounded Magistrates. Among
the proceedings at Bow Street, the other day, was an account of some
lawyers’ clerk having dropped in to make the worthy occupants of the
Bench the parties to a suit, simply because some money had been left
to the poor-box out of an estate which it had pleased the lawyers to
throw into Chancery. It is really frightfui that a ten-pound note
cannot be received for the use of the poor of the district, without
involving those entrusted with the application of it in a suit in Chancery.
The Magistrates may well feel a horror at any one approaching them
with a charitable contribution, lest they may find themselves some
morning the rºº a suit, and may learn the bitter fact, that some-
body has filed a bill, involving, of course, a succession of other bills of
the usual exorbitant character.
If this sort of thing is to be tolerated, a lawyer may, with malice
prépense, cause a five-pound note to be placed in the hands of any
respectable individual, under some paltry pretext, with the ulterior view
of making him a party to a suit in Chancery. If a lawyer were to offer
us a present of any sum of money, we would shun him and his bait, with
the cry of
– “timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.”
According to the report we have read, the Magistrates expressed, very
naturally, their surprise and indignation at being “taken in" as parties
to a matter in which they have not a particle of interest. The lawyer's
clerk endeavoured to appease their Worships by the remark, that the
costs would º be paid “out of the estate; ” as if an estate was
nothing more nor less than a fund, out of which lawyers' bills are
payable. It would be a wholesome provision, if it could be enforced,
that wherever a suit is undertaken, which is of no benefit to any but
the lawyers, the lawyers should be made to pay for their own fun out
of their own pockets
THE DERBY “INSIDES.”
At the late North Essex Election, MR. C. G. Round, in proposing
MR. BERESFORD, made a speech, wherein, among other facetious
remarks, he said—
“They remembered the joke of ‘the Derby dilly with its six insides, but the Derby
dilly now carried more than six inside; it was full both inside and out (Cheers and
laughter). The coach was well horsed; the owner of the coach drove it self, and
he was sure they all wished him “God speed,' (Cheers).”
MR. Round and the farmers of North Essex should reflect that the
DERby dilly will not do at all now-a-days. The old coach, however well
horsed and well driven, is not fast enough for these times; too slow :
or as we may say, dilly-tory. We must have the DERby Express
Train, if we are to go by the firiº anything. To satisfy us, DeRBy
must get his steam up, and comply with the requisition of progress.
As to “insides,” DeRBY has many more than six to carry. He has
some twenty millions and upwards: and said insides will never stomach
DERBy if he attempts to humbug them with the little loaf.
A Monument for the Man of Pills.
The grateful admirers of MoRIson, the Hygeist, are called upon by
advertisement in the papers to subscribe towards a monument to the
memory of the great pilſ-compiler. ...We think that a simple slab of
stone, erected in the churchyard fullest of the Doctor's late patien's
would be sufficient, with the well-known words: “Si monumentum quarris,
circumspice /*
MINISTERIAL ORIGINALITY.
It is the opinion of those best qualified to judge, that, if the present
Ministers are to remain in office, their policy must be a continuation of
that of the Free Trade Cabinet. But they will do somewhat more
than imitate their predecessors if they will also take off the Income-tax.

PENAL STATUES.
To the Memory of Monopolists, and other Great National Malefactors.
--> T this time, when
so considerable a
party is seeking to
reimpose the tax
upon food, it is
seasonable to re-
mark, that there
exist very insuffi-
cient means for
handing down to
º men who
ave deserved ill
of their country.
History does very
inadequate justice
to those statesmen
and politicians
whose whole lives
have been spent
in opposing all wise and good legislation. Sculpture is at present a
one-sided art: it transmits to future generations the heroes, lawgivers,
philosophers, poets, moralists, and warriors of the past; but it creates
no memorials of the numerous individuals who have distinguished
themselves as flunkies, obstructives, blockheads, dunces, rogues, and
poltroons. - -
Now, Sculpture should not be subservient to mere image-worship; it
should fashion the scarecrow as well as the idol. Accordingly, as there
is a Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey, there ought to be a Knaves'
Corner in Newgate, and a Fools’ Corner at Bedlam; and the statues
of persons who have in any eminent degree *nº baseness, dis-
honesty, folly, dulness, bigotry, cowardice, or other despicable
qualities—public odium and contempt, should be set up in HER
MAJESTY's various gaols, bridewells, and houses of correction, through-
out the country.
It is a pity that no such monuments have been erected; for instance,
in dishonour of the antagonists of the Repeal of the Test and Corpo-
ration Acts, of Reform in Parliament, of the abolition of º In
the Army, Hof the mitigation of the Insolvency Laws and the Criminal
Code.--&f Unsectarian Education,-and, in general, of Civil and Reli-
gious Liberty. -
The chisel has hitherto been devoted too exclusively to the sublime
and beautiful; but is equally available for the absurd and the ridi-
culous: and the statues of ignoble and execrable characters would be
caricatures in stone, and would answer the . Pºlº of all cari-
catures; namely, to bring baseness, villany, bigotry, folly, selfishness,
and hypocrisy, into contempt: with this advantage, that instead of
being ephemeral, they would be, perennial; so that corn might point
the finger at them throughout all ages, for an eternal warning to our
descendants.
The statues of fellows renowned for their impudence might be
executed in brass; those of celebrated bigots in stubborn granite; and
similar analogies might be carried out in other instances. -
A Temple of Ignominy might be built on purpose to contain the
testimonials of an indignant nation to its Meanest and Worst. The
mediaeval style would be preferable for such an edifice; both because
it belongs to the bad old times, which the opponents of light and
advancement wish to return to; and also, because it affords a variety
of niches for the figures of those that deserve to be placed in them:
and likewise admits of copious embellishment with corbels; for which
ornaments the heads of dilatory, anti-reform LoRD CHANCELLORs, and
cantankerous or covetous bishops, would be very suitable.
Some of our actually existing monuments of eminent characters
would be perfectly fit to be transferred to the Temple of Ignominy
without alteration, being already quite ridiculous enough, and repre-
senting monarchs and other personages of rank, chiefly remarkable for
depravity and stupidity.
De mortuis nil nisi bonum is a rusty saw, ancient, but not venerable,
nor even respectable. It bespeaks the character of a man who is
conscious of deserving to be ill-spoken of, and the understanding of one
who imagines that, after his decease, it can be of any consequence to
him if he is. By pillorying an evil memory, you admonish the living
without hurting the dead.
GUY FAwkes, at present, is the only delinquent whose ill-fame is
perpetuated by an effigy.
et us hope that no noblemen or gentlemen, by conspiring to restore
the bread-tax, will qualify themselves for a similar immortality.
GOING GREAT LENGTHS.
THE longest American yarn upon record is the mile-and-a-half of
rope which CAPTAIN SEABURY let the Sea-Serpent out with.
THE ROEBUCK AND COPPOCK CONTROWERSY.
THE public will, no doubt, remember the indignant repudiation of
MR. Coprock, the Whig electioneering agent, by MR. Roebuck, the
Member for Bath, who prides himself, very properly, upon paying
“nothing to nobody” for a seat in Parliament. The Honourable Mem:
ber, in ife length of his career, and the shortness of his memory, had
forgotten the receipt of £300, through the hands of MR. Coppock, for
some necessary election expenses; but with his characteristic candour,
he avows the lapse he made, the moment it was pointed out to him.
This prelude will explain the purpose of the following melody, supposed
to have been “knocked off” by the Honourable Member for Sheffield,
in reference to the great—or little–CoPPOCK controversy, which has
lately occupied the columns of the newspapers.
A18–4. Oh / no, we never mention him.”
Oh! no, I never mention him,
His name is never heard;
I quite forgot the money, though;
did, upon my word.
From Club to Club they hurry me,
To join some festive set;
And though I dine at the Reform,
The fact I do forget.
They bid me recollect the cash
That CoPPock paid to me:
They say my speech was rather rash;
But what is that to me?
'Tis true that I no longer need
The aid of such a set;
And when I’ve had all that I sought,
Of course I may forget.
They tell me I’m confuted now,
Or was the other day;
They hint I was mistaken—but
I heed not what they say; -
Perchance ’tis hard to struggle with
A fact that can't be met;
But those who talk as I have talked,
Must now and then forget.
Hurrah for the Road!
APARLIAMENTARY Return, recently published, shows that in England
and Wales the receipts on account of hiº in counties in the year
ending March 25, 1850, amounted to the rather considerable sum of
£1,040,645. 18s. 3d.
We are very much afraid that though we have no downright Dick
TURPINs and Jack Sheppards nowadays, we have not yet exactly
put a stop to highway robbery.
MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.
The Protectionists are very *...* asking, what the Ministers
mean to do. We can give an answer. They mean to do the country
if they can; and if not, they will do the Protectionists.
Striking Hard.
THE Observer says, that in consequence of the Engineers’ strike,
20,000 men have been out of work since the 10th of January, and cal-
culates the amount of wages lost by them up to the present time, at
£175,000, besides £2000 spent by the trade societies in maintaining the
strike. Will the strikers persevere in striking so hard as this, seeing
with how much force they strike themselves?
A BLACK JOB.
If it should turn out that MR. Disraeli means positively to propose
a tax on fuel, he may be sure that in curtailing the public of their
coals, he will very speedily get the sack.
Cries for the Country Party.
Two mottoes are to be inscribed on the Protectionist banner; viz.-

Remember your Duty, = Do.!!
ONE WAY of EFFECTING SILENCE.-The French Senators are not

THE (MILK) PALE OF SOCIETY.
SoMEBody advertises a new machine,
called a “Milk-tester,” to test the
genuineness of milk. Where is the milk-
sop who would torture himself unneces-
sarily by the use of a machine which would
only confirm his worst suspicions? Who
wants to test the veracity of that chalky
article, which we all know to be one of the
most universal of white lies that was ever
palmed upon society? In matters of milk,
“where ignorance is bliss, ’tis folly to be
wise.” If every one could test the stuff
that is placed daily on his breakfast table,
his own blood would turn into curds, or
run cold with ice-cream. Talk of a “good
glass of wine” as a thing difficult of at-
tainment; it is easy in comparison to the
almost utter impossibility of procuring in
London a genuine glass of milk. How
hopeless, then, the process of testing the
treacherous compound! Far better to
swallow it with all its faults, than attempt
to dive too deeply into its mysteries; for
there is scarcely a pint of milk in London
that would even bear to have its surface
skimmed.

to see through walls, and to relate what
is occurring at any distance. If Louis
NAPOLEoN does not take care, the dis-
cussions of his Senate and Legislative
Assembly will transpire in their actuality,
notwithstanding his precautions to prevent
the truth of them from being got at ; and
we confidently expect that his next edict
will be a decree against clairvoyance.
WHAT WAS FOUND INSIDE THE AMERICAN SEA-
SERPENT.
THE papers make mention of the contents of the American Sea-
Serpent, when its stomach was cut open. We were sadly disappointed
with the poverty of the Catalogue. The principal article in it seems
to have been “a squid,”—whatever that may be. We have seen
many wonderful things in our lifetime, but we never recollect seeing a
“squid.” We suppose it must be one of the numerous (s)guiddities to
§. the American Sea-Serpent, in its extraordinary career, has given
lrth.
But we are confident there must have been some terrible omissions
in the Catalogue. . When we think of the capacity of its swallow—and
of the capacity of the public's swallow, also, with regard to it—we
are sure there must have been inside the American Sea-Serpent some-
thing, more than a mere “squid.” If not, a great opportunity has
been lost in the way of invention, and we hasten to supply the list
of the articles that were, or ought to have been, ſound inside “its
stomach.” -
The Disappearance of the Falls of Niagara;-an authentic account
of that wonderful freak of nature, as related in the American papers
several years ago.
The Certificate of birth of WASHINGTON's black nurse, and a mug
belonging to the same, with the inscription, “A trifle from Brighton.”
(These have been bought for 20,000 dollars by MR. BARNUM).
A hearthrug made from the wool that was shorn from the celebrated
“Woolly Horse.” (This has likewise been purchased, at an enormous
sacrifice, by MR, BARNUM). -
The Whip with which America flogs all creation, and the American
Flag, showing the “Stripes” that were received from it.
A Pennsylvanian Bond, with “Paid” at the bottom.
A New Orleans Paper, without an advertisement of a runaway Slave
in it.
The Ruler with which Britannia ruled the waves, before she was
beaten last year at Cowes by the Yankee yacht, America.
Portraits of the 250,000 British ladies that were kissed by GENERAL
ToM THUMB. - -
Cheque-books of the American Publishers, who have ruined them-
selves with the enormous sums of money they have given to English
authors for their works.-Wery curious.
The Green Spectacles which the clever Dairyman put on his cows
when he turned them into a chalk-pit, to persuade them they were
cating grass. -
The colour of the Gentleman's Mº who was so tarnation sharp,
that his shadow even cut thin bread and butter.
Portrait of the fast young New Yorker who, when called upon to pay
the debt of nature, proposed to do it one half in dry goods, the other
half in bills.
But this is quite enough to prove the number of things and people
the American Sea-Serpent has taken in ever since it has been running
through the seas, and the columns of the American newspapers.
Not to be Wondered at.
In the Times of the 10th inst., we read an advertisement commencing,
somewhat naively, thus—
To BE SOLD. The Artist of the Panorama now Exhibiting, &c.
We were quite prepared for this. There, has really, been such a
perfect glut of Panoramas of late, that it has long seemed questionable
to us if more than one in a hundred could be reasonably expected to
pay. And we are, therefore, not at all surprised to find the disappºinted
Artist of one of them thus candidly admitting himself to be “Sold.”
A DESPERATE THROW.
THE Protectionists are naturally anxious to postpone, as long as they
can, the process of throwing themselves upon the country; for º:
perfectly well that the country will throw them off again immediately.
In the Name of Charity.
PERHAPs it is ºf to be hard upon the DiskAEII Ministry; for

Ministry is responsible for its acts, until it has attained its Majority /*

THEATRICAL ANNOUNCEMENT.
ITH great pleasure
the DiRECTOR of the
NEW PALACE THEA-
TRE, WESTMINstER,
respectfully announces
to the Nobility, Gentry,
and Clergy, that the
performances at this
establishment have re-
commenced, under new
management. -
Considerable 1m-
provements have re-
it." been made in
the building itself; a
new Royal Entrance
has been constructed;
* a spacious salon, en-
titled “St. Stephen's
Hall,” has been opened
for loungers, a commo-
dious Royal Gallery
has been erected, and
refreshment stalls have
been placed in the
lobbies.
The Red Boxes, upon
which so much indig
nation has been ex-
pended, have been re-
- - - moved, and, Ly way of
assimilation to the system which has been adopted in remodelling the Company, Green
Ones have been introduced.
The Company has been completely re-organised. The principal leading characters will
in future be sustained by MR, RUPERT DILLY (the Director), and MR. PopANILLA Dizzy
(the celebrated delineator of Mosaic-Arab characters); but, in addition to Messrs. DILLY
and Dizzy, some valuable engagements, chiefly of Provincial motorieties, have been effected.
In Walking Gentlemen the corps will be found exceedingly strong; and in compliance with
a “genera { expressed and clearly understood popular demand.” each member of the
company will Walk as speedily as possible.
The Director has been anxious, to avoid the rococo formality of , an address, , stating
intentions, but will mention that the new repertoire of his company will be calculated to give
no offence in any quarter. The old farce of Protection has certainly been some time in pre-
paration, and has been a good deal “written up,” but it will not be brought forward this
season, or indeed at all, except under the new title of Lend me Five Shillings.
Our National Defences will be among the earliest novelties, and no expense will be spared
thereupon. MESSRs. DiLLY and Dizzy propose to introduce the remainder of the company
as Qur. Clerks. MR. PAKINGTON will make his appearance as the Country Squire, and also
(with MR. MALMSBURY) in Fish out of Water; MR. MANNERs will appearin }.} England,
and MR. NAAs will make his bow as Backbite in the School for Scandal.
The comic entertainment of Dublin Castle will be revived for MR. EGLINToUN, and
the splendid real armour will be introduced, as worn at the Scottish Tournament.
The ballet department will be under the skilful and experienced direction of MR.
Lonsdale.
The firework department will be solely entrusted to MR. Dizzy, whose displays in that
line have already given so much satisfaction. MR. WALPole will however, assist him
with some Roman Candles, from the celebrated manufactory of Professor Pusey, in
which MR. W. is a partner.
The Order system will be revised, and orders will be given . only to Members of the
Aristocracy. The privilege of the Public press will be retrenched as far as is expedient ;
the Director being anxious to save all annoyance to his patrons. Places will be kept
as long as possible.
Any applications as to, bills, to be addressed to the Director only. It is hoped that no
rson will expose the bills of this company. Seats may be obtained by private application at
he Carlton Club., Stalls (by clergymen, on proof of electioneering utility,) may be heard of
at the Chancellor's Arms, St. Leonard's on See. Divisions will be gladly got rid of, should
a party be desirous of coming to support any particular representation by the company.
The theatre has been decorated by MR, BARRY in mediaeval style, appropriate to the
intended efforts of the Director, and DR. REID has promised him his best co-operation in
blowing hot and cold.
€ºr IN REHEARSAL. A farce, entitled The Budget. An extravaganza, named Mind my Corn,
and a concluding pièce de circonstance called Out with Them or A Good Riddance.
Vivant Regina et Princeps. No Money returned (if voted).
Murder will (shortly) Out.
-- A BIOGRAPHICAL periodical announces, as the title of one of its principal articles,
"I.ORD PALMERSTON concluded.” It is an old story, to talk of a writer attempting an
individual's life: but poor Lord PALMERston seems to have been treated with unusual
gruelty; for, his “conclusion” being advertised, we presume that the attempter of his life
has actually made an end of him.
THE CAPTURE OF THE SEA-
SERPENT.
TUNE–" Giles Scroggins's Ghost.”
(THE serPENT's HEAD Is supposed to SING.)
BEHold ! good people, here I am ;
Time out of mind, you’ve heard of me;
But always counted me a Sham—
A mere chimaera of the sea.
By Phantasm Captains oft I’ve pass'd,
Careering o'er the briny vast;
However, I’ve been caught at last,
As sure as e'er was any flea.
Who this exploit was to achieve,
Possibly may have been foreknown;
The hero could be, you’ll believe,
A bold American alone.
That mighty nation, which is said
In everything to go a-head,
May boast of having kill'd me dead—
Aye, as dead as any stone.
CHARLEs SEABURY, master of the ship
Monongahela, southward bound—
A vessel on a whaling trip—
Will for my capture be renown'd;
On January's thirteenth day,
In the Pacific as I lay,
All unsuspiciously at play,
"Mid the billows, I was found.
I, lying quietly afloat,
Little aware what foes were near;
They stole up to me in a boat,
And darted into me a spear.
At first I knew it not ; but soon
Became aware of that harpoon
Lodged in me by the Yankee loon,
And felt considerably queer.
The Captain, as he made his lunge,
I had knock'd overboard outright:
Three of the crew did also plunge
Into the sea for very fright.
This, at the time I did not know,
But dived into the deep below—
About a mile and an eighth, or so;
Very nearly, if not quite.
Of course I took that length of rope
Down, down beneath the ocean wave:
You'lithinki had a liberal scope;
But, ah! my bacon't wouldn't save.
All faint with loss of blood and pain,
Seeking the surface of the main,
Tº came and poked at me again:
ow very cruel to behave
They fancied they had kill'd me “slick,”
Seeing me all so quiet lie;
When dying, I began to kic
Which caused them speedily to fly;
And then, at a safe distance, those
Tarnation loafers, I suppose,
Look'd on, and view'd my mortal throes:
At lastidid in earnest die.
They measured me; and vow’d by Heaven!
By GENERAL WASHINGTON they swore
was a hundred and three feet seven,
#. full forty-nine feet four !
With ninety-four teeth in my jaws,
And all as sharp as any saw's;
I likewise had a sort of paws—
All which I never knew before.
They’ve saved my head, my bones and skin,
hich MR. BARNUM, of course, will show,
Who never takes the public in,
As all the universe must know.
But though my skin with spears be drill’d,
And after that with wadding fill'd
fºlculate fºm "scotch'd, not kiſſ'd,”
As, peradventure, time will show.

THE ART OF EGG-THROWING.
As there is every probability of a general election, there will shortly
be a sudden rise in the price of eggs. Parties, therefore, who wish to
be well supplied with the . missiles of electioneering warfare,
cannot be recommended too º # to give their orders directly. The
delay of every day may make the difference of a penny a dozen, a great
consideration in the case of an election being severely contested.
In Westminster, for instance, the most lively preparations have been
making for some time. One candidate, who has determined to spare
no expense, has engaged the services of those intrepid officers, who
distinguished themselves in such an eggsemplary manner last year at
Epsom. They are to be provided with a separate booth, †.
champagne and eau-de-Cologne, and as many eggs as they can
throw—and all free of expense. It is expected that no opposition
will be strong enough to stand against such an attack. What makes
the danger still more to be dreaded is the awful fact that this devoted
band, #. aim in egg-throwing is so unerring that some of the most
practised shots have been known to hit a man's eye at sixty yards
distance, will be supplied with a few of the eggs of i. wingless bird
of Madagascar! W . we mention that one of the eggs of this monster
bird is equal to 148 of our common hen's eggs, we shall give a small
notion of the alarm that exists in the breasts of the electors of West-
minster. . He must be a bold patriot indeed who will expose himself to
the fire of 148 eggs, by venturing to votein the teeth of such a battery,
with the shells flying about him in all directions. We are afraid that
not a soul, excepting BARON NATHAN, who bears a charmed life against
; will have the pluck to go near the hustings! unless, perchance, some
unhappy yokel should get between two cross fires, and so be egged
on from both sides to record his vote either in favour of one or the other.

HAD I a pound of tender Steak,

To take it off, were best;
And gently let it fry alone,
Without the sauce or zest.

TEETOTAL ORGIES.
We have to thank the Editor of the Band of Hope Review for

ºbject of inducing us to reconsider our remarks on the ridiculous exhi.
bition lately made of themselves by certain children, small and great,
belonging to a Total Abstinence Society of the same name as his pub.
lication. We still, however, retain the opinion, that to shout for
Temperance in the streets, is not the way to promote that virtue; and
that no advantage to the cause of sobriety can accrue from a number
ºf little boyº.and girls voting an affected and artificial address to the
Panch of WALEs, to tell him how good they mean to be, and indirectly
to invite him to turn Teetotaller. Let our abstemious contemporary
observe that we do not reprehend these and such like proceedings, out
of opposition to the Temperance movement ; on the contrary, we object
to them on the very ground that they impede it, by bringing it into
90ntempt. Indeed, we consider that it is we who discourage drunkenness,
in caricaturing it; whereas Bands of Hope and other Teetotallers, who
run about playing the fool, do jº. the reverse, inasmuch as their conduct
tends to expose sobriety itsel to derision. It is true that we demur
both to the principle and practice of entire abstinence from fermented
liquors, believing them to form no exception to the rule that prescribes
moderation in all things. If we are to abstain from everything that is
capable of bein abused, there is nothing we must not abstain from.
Qorn, wine, and oil are each good; abstain from wine, and why not
from oil and corn, and renounce bread itself, and eat salad raw? or,
rather, don't eat it at all, for you may commit excess in grazing:-
starve and die.
Yet we respect even the absolute repudiation of fermented drink in

Carry out the idea of a Band of Hope parade, and you might, indeed
have an anti-Bacchic procession; and FATHER MATHEw, or our friend

Anti-SILENUs. The only objection to such a display is, that it is the
state of intoxication, rather than the cause of it, that is wrong: and
that, if enthusiasm will produce all the effects of ardent spirits, it is as
bad to indulge in the former as to tipple the latter.
Gluttony is as great, if not as ruinous, a vice as drunkenness: it is
even more particularly bestial, as being jº. piggish. Now
imagine a set of people who had pledged themselves to low diet,
assembling in front of the Mansion House, and shouting “Gruel for

it tend in the least to the diminution of civic voracity ?
If it is commendable and expedient to cry Temperance, like mackerel,
why not the other virtues also? Why should not Bands of Charity

about, vociferating their zeal each for its peculiar walk in the paths of
rectitude P carrying banners, embroidered with their favourite maxims,
and hallooing, “ f. for Brotherly Love!” ...“Three, Cheers for
Genuine Religion " " “Justice, Truth, and No Mistake l’ “Patience
and Humility–Nine Times Nine !” “No Roguery!” “Away with
Envy, Hatred, and Malice l’”, “Down with All Uncharitableness!”

be preached by a hullaballoo?
he patrons of the “Band of Hope” very probably mean well in
some measure; but in as far as, their intention is to cause the
disuse of inebriating drinks, they will in vain seek to accomplish it by
puerile demonstrations; which, indeed, are rather likely to impel some
persons to drink, out of bravado and contempt. They may here and
there convert a drunken cobbler—or rather turn his brain, previously
addled, and transform his delirium tremens to their own frenzy; but
they will disgust and repel every masculine toper. EBENEzER Styles

It is for them seriously to consider whether they do not do more harm than good. Much
mischief is wrought by MR. STIGGINs through his mixing up his straight hair and grimaces
with sacred things. People get to laugh at the whole idea of STIGGINs existing in their
minds, sacred things inclusive. The sacred things should be separated from the grimaces
and straight hair; and thus, be it clearly understood, do we º: Temperance from
intemperate display. Nay, we even, commend Teetotalism itself-to the, weak-headed.

SALE OF AUTOGRAPHS.
An interesting sale of Autographs has recently taken place in the neighbourhood of Covent
Garden. The principal purchasers are eminent dealers, in butter, trunks, and crockery; and
the competition was very spirited. One of them was kind enough to jot down a few of the
prices upon the head of a cask, which served him for a seat during the sale, and, which, under
the new postal regulations in favour of literature, we have returned to him by post. We
subjoin a selection.
A letter of MR. John SMITH, without date, but addressed to MR. THOMAs BRows,
saying that he was going to call on MR. WILLIAM Jones (possibly SIR WILLIAM, when
gung), 0l. 0s. 0d. A letter from the lessee (anonymous) of Vauxhall, in 1802, informing
R. Robinson, of Lambeth, that he was on the free list,0l. 0s. 0.4d. A printed letter from
the Postmaster-General (1824), acknowledging MR. Wiggins's complaint that he had lost
eleven money-letters, and promising that inquiry should be made. A M.S. note on the back,
in MR. W.'s hand-" All I ever heard of it.” This fetched a penny. A forged order on
the Coburg Pit (1829), which had been refused, with a º on the back that “this
might have been a joke of Theodore Hook's, as that eminent wag was living at the time,”
brought three-halfpence. The cover of an Eton Latin Grammar, with “P. A. J.” written
inside, and which was therefore conjectured to have been George CANNING's (as he was at
Eton), and to refer to the “Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin,” was bought in. The (supposed)
original M.S. of the celebrated epitaph, “Afflictions sore long time Ibore,” &c., in a strong
hand, and “D. S.” below it (perhaps DEAN Swift), fetched one-halfpenny. A copy-book, one
cover torn off, with “Bounty Commands Esteem,” in the first page, rest blank, brought
twopence. A frank, written by BARON NATHAN, under the impression that he was a Peer
of the Realm, sixpence, understood to have been bought by the Rosherville Egg Club.
Author's M.S. copy of a letter of nineteen pages, addressed hy MR. John Tomkins to the
Times newspaper, complaining that he had been insulted by the Beadle of the Burlington
Arcade (the letter does not appear to have been inserted by that journal), thickpaper, twopence.

building of Hoxton Poorhouse, dismissing an
Irish hodman for insubordination under the in-
fluence of beer, a penny-farthing. An Album

seats in the country, charades, and recipes for
colds, blackleading stoves, and pickles, was bid

Ana-º. She wore a Wreath of Roses."
He wore a pair of Bluchers
The Term he first came here;
Was mostly seen in cap and gown,
And drank no bitter beer;
He took his daily walk alone,
From two to four—if fine:
Return'd to chapel and to hall,
And never went to wine.
He gave me tea with marmalade
(His rooms were next to mine);
I often found him reading hard,
And always in by nine.
A suit of stylish cut he wore
Before his “smalls” were past;
His supper-party afterwards
Was very very fast. -
In “beaver,” now, he roved “the High,”
In studs and châtelaine;
Took airings with a fancy dog,
And with a fancy cane.
He often cut his lectures,
And voted books a bore;
Was famous for his skill at “Pool,”
And also as “an oar.”
And once again I saw this youth,
When, spite of “cram” at last,
He heard from me the fatal news
Which told he had not pass'd;
He did not swear, or tear his hair,
But said, “I’ve been an ass;
I’ll sport the oak for fear of duns,
And then we’ll have some “Bass.”
I never saw him after,
But heard within the year,
That he had sail'd for Hobart Town,
To take a sheep-walk there.

THE SIBTHORPS OF ENGLAND.

UR country is as proud of
CoLoREL SIBTHoRP as the
Egyptians are proud of their
Great Pyramid; and for the
like reasons—his grandeur
and his unchangeableness,
The ColoneL has addressed
the green men of Lincoln,
that is the men of Lincoln green, as a future
candidate:-
-
“I may be permitted to feel some honest pride in
adverting to a former representation of your ancient
city by one of that family as far back as the year 1714,
and subsequently by other members of it at different
periods, on one firm, unchanged principle.”
The SIBTHoRPs never change; or, at most,
are the very last to yield to the spirit of
progress.
It is now known, that the ancient Briton
who was the last to eschew paint and go into
a modern suit of rabbit-skins, was a SIBTHORP.
“EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT OF A JUDGE.”
SUCH is the title—given by the newspapers—to the very summary
conduct of MR. Justice MAULE in the Crown Court of Lincoln. The
Court was villanously ventilated—the Judge felt himself in an air-
pump. He ordered all the windows to be “immediately opened.”
This could not be done; it required two or three minutes for a man to
reach the top of the building wherefrom the windows could be opened.
* Break the windows " cried the Judge, impatient of suffocation;
“smash every glass 1” and the windows were summarily broken, an
the panes instantly smashed, the pieces falling into the Court, “on the
heads of the people below.”
This is called very “extraordinary conduct of a Judge;” and yet to the
mind of Punch it bears an instructive moral. Only think, if a MAULE,
years ago, had sat upon the Woolsack; imagine him in that air-pump-
the Court of. Chancery. See him gasping, suffocating, pent-up by
delaying, shifting forms, and hear him : (and exult when hearing him
shout)+"Smash all the windows!—break all the panes! that the pure
breath of heaven may pass current here, sweetening this black-hole of
foulness and abomination.”

AUSTRIAN REWARD OF HOSPITALITY.
THERE is a Spectator published at Vienna—no doubt, from what
follows, an impulsive, enthusiastic print, like unto our own Spectator
of London; for, the Austrian Spectator proposes a testimonial to the
landlady at Bankside, who, in his hour of flight and trouble, harboured
and comforted BARCLAY AND PERKINs's hunted HAYNAu:
“The †. dwells with much feeling [says the Daily News] upon the kind be-
haviour of the landlady, and suggests that Austrian patriotism should endow her with
a neck-ornament, with the portrait of the Marshal in enamel, set with brilliants.”
Beautiful is gratitude, no matter whence it comes, and how
developed. With this belief, we would suggest a reconsideration of
the means of rewarding the landlady. If she be a widow, and HAYNAU
a . why not marry them, settling on the happy couple a
thumping fortune? If other circumstances make it prudent that the
landlady should still keep a hostelry, we would suggest the sign of
“The HAYNAU's Head;” and further, that the portrait of the General
be executed by Austrian artists, and framed in Austrian gold. Or,
what would still be better, perhaps GENERALHAYNAU would, come to
London to sit for his picture? Should he be inclined to do this, there
is no doubt that our present Foreign Secretary would lend him a room
Šíthe purpose—the room with the repaired ceiling—at the Foreign
Co.
The Church in Danger.
A PARAGRAPH in the papers informs us that several of the swell mob
were present at a recent Confirmation held at the church in Newgate
Street, by the Bishop of LoNDoN. We really can see no excuse for
the conduct of these fellows, who could not have gone for the purpose
of being confirmed, as the fact of their dishonest occupation shows them
to have been already confirmed scoundrels.

Well, as the crocodile, upon the “gentleman’s” authority, respectfully declined to swallow
the shamrock, we suppose Punch must.

matter, and finds that the crocodile was, in a former state, a big, º ſ

thoughtful arrangements in the New House of Commons, the “Ladies’
Gallery” is placed close behind that of the Reporters. It seems hardly
necessary to add that the spécialité of one class of auditors slightly
clashes with that of the other. We regret to learn, that during recent
debates, a series of earnest messages have been sent up-stairs to
MR. E.L.IIs, the Curator of the Ladies' department; messages which
may be divided into two heads:–
... From the Single Reporters.--"Would you, intimate to the ladies, that
if they would kindly preserve silence while the Minister is speaking,
e”—
From the Married Reporters.-"Do tell those women to hold their
tongues. How do they think one can take a sentence of DISRAELI,
while they make such an abominable clatter that ”—
But, need we add, that no lady of proper spirit ever vouchsafed notice
of impertinent requests. An occasional “Good gracious ! what next, I
wonder?” with an indignant giggle, by way of note of non-admiration
at the end, broke through the gilded grating (which, Oriental-wise,
screens the Parliamentary Hareem), announcing that F. MR. ELLIs
had humbly thrown in his second-hand †: at the door behind;
but not one whit the less fast and furious did the lady-voices descend,
mingling with the blasts of hot and cold air poured down by DR. REID,
“that air-Pump of the nation.”
In despair, the Reporters have thrown themselves upon Mr. Punch.
One of them, by way of evidence of his affliction, has enclosed to that
universal philanthropist the following extract from his note-book. The
unfortunate stenographer was making desperate efforts to report a
speech of the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchequEB; but the concurrent
exertions of the sweet little cherubs who sat up aloft, appear to have
caused him to introduce a variety of allusions, of which the best that
can be said is, that they are about as irrelevant as a good many of the
topics, usually introduced by the Honourable and Semitic Member
imself. Here is a specimen:
“MR. DisrAELI (continued). And, Sir, when I am officially apprised
that the noble Lord, then virtually the first of HER MAJESTY's Ser-
vants, was dismissed because, oh, my dear soul, we found in her box

THE HERO OF FIVE HUNDRED
FLIGHTS.
It has been recently announced, that the
veteran GREEN, of ballooning notoriety, intends
retiring finally from the Air, and settling himself
on terra firma, at the expiration of the ensuing
season. He purposes going through the round
of his aérial characters, previous to his farewell;
and he will appear, for the last times, in that
very popular Air with which his name has ben
so long identified. Having long ago soared to
the top of not only his own, but every other
profession, he looks forward to repose on the
earth; and we trust he will find his hopes well
grounded. He has had many rivals—among
others, an individual who was able to boast that,
as an Aéronaut, he had got to the top of the tree;
but, though he did, in truth, get to the top of the
tree, he got no higher, for his Balloon, always
stuck in it. Mr. GREEN has invariably risen
superior to all competition; and, though, success
has attended every inflation of his Balloon, he
has never become inflated himself by the success
that has attended him.
The Air of Downing Street.
The Chronicle remarks with good philosophy
upon the peculiar air of Downing Street: it
“imparts an instantaneous respectability to
every one who breathes it,” says the icle;
which then proceeds to note the probable change
in the manner of the most restless, wriggling
demagogues, upon reaching the Treasury. §:
reminds us of the ingenuous avowal of the Jesuit
Acost A, who, in his Yº: to Peru, speaking
for himself and his hair-shirted companions, say
in glowing acknowledgment of the salubrity o
the air at a certain latitude,-" Here, all our
vermin died upon us.”

THE DEATH OF THE SEA-SERPENT.
BY PUBLIUS JONATHAN VIRGILIUS JEFFERSON SMIth.
ARMA yirumque cano, qui first, in the Monongahela,

Musa, look smart with your Banjo I guess, to relate or invent, I
Shall need all the aid you can give; so, Nunc aspirate canenti.
Mighty slick were the vessel progressing, jactata per acquora ventis;
But the brow of the skipper was cloudy cum sollicitudine mentis;
For whales had been skase in them pearts; and the clipper, so long as
he'd known her,
Ne'er had gather'd less ile in her cruise, to gladden the heart of her
owner.
“Darn, the whales!” cried the skipper at length, “with a telescope
forte widebo
Aut P. aut terras.” While speaking, just two or three points on the
ee bow,
He saw coming towards them, as fast as though to a combat 't would
tempt 'em,
A monstrum, horrendum, informe (cui lumen was shortly ademptum).
Qn the taffrail up jumps in a hurry dux fortis, and seizing a trumpet,
With a blast that would waken the dead, mare turbat et aera rumpiº-
Tumble up, all you lubbers!” he cries, “tumble up! for, careering
before us,
Is the raal old Sea-Sarpent himself, cristis maculisque decorus.”
gº Comº it!' cried one of the sailors, “if e'er we provoke him, he’ll
lil us :
He'll sartinly chaw up hos morsu, et longis implexibus illos.”
Loud laughs the bold skipper, and quick premit alto corde dolorem;
Iſ he does ſeel like running, he knows it won't do to betray it before 'em.
"O Socii,” inquit, “I’m sartin you air not the fellers to funk, or
Shinº the durum certamen, whose fathers fought bravely to

You! who have waged with the bárs, and the buffeler, proclia dura,
Down to the freshes and licks of our own free enlighten’d Missourer
You! who could whip your own weight catulis saevis sine telo,
Get your eyes skinn'd in a twinkling, et ponite tela phaselo!”

Marshals his 'cute little band, now panting their foe to beleaguer.
Swiftly they lower the boats, and swiftly each man at his oar is,
Excipe Britanni timidi duo, virque coloris; - - -
(Blackskin, you know, never feels how sweet 'tis pro patriá mori;
OvID had him in view when he said, “Nimium ne crede colori.”)
Now swiftly they pull towards the monster, who seeing the cutter and
gig nigh, - - -
Glares at them with terrible eyes, suffectis º et igni;
And never conceiving their chief so swiftly will deal him a floorer,
Opens wide, to receive them at once, his linguis vibrantibus ora;
But just as he’s licking his li s, and gladly preparing to taste 'em,
Straight into his eyeball the skipper stridentem conjicit hastam.
Soon as he feels in his eyeball the lance, growing mightily sulky,
At 'em he comes in a rage ore minax, linguāque trisulcă. -
“Starn all!” cry the sailors at once, for they think he has certainly
caught 'em;
Praesentemque viris intentant omnia mortem. -
But the bold skipper exclaims, “O tergue quaterque bea'i'.
Now, with a will, dare viam, when I want you, be only parati;
This hoss feels like raising his hair, and in spite of his scaly old cortex,
Full soon you shall see that his corpse rapidus vorat ſequore vortex.”
Hoc ait, and choosing a lance, “With this one I think I shall hit it,”
He cries; and straight into its mouth ad intima viscera mittit.
Screeches the crittur in pain, and writhes till the sea is commotum,
As if all its waves had been lash'd in a tempest per Eurum et Notum;

Prospiciens sadly around, wiped his eye with the cuff of bis paletót;
And mad at his favourite's fate, of oaths utter'd two or three thousand
Such as, Corpo di Bacco Mehercule ! Sacré ! Mille tonnerres i

But the skipper, who thought it was time to this terrible fight dare
nem,
With a scalping-knife jumps on the neck of the snake, secat et dextra

And hurling the scalp in the air, half wild with delight to possess it,
Shouts, “Darn it! W. ºve fixed up his flint, for in ventos vita recessit.”

SUFFOLK-ATION OF JUSTICE.
SUFrolk is a county, the natives of which are
for the most part a decent sort of people, and by
no means generally remarkable for want of sense,
deficiency in the sentiment of justice, barbarity,
or brutal vindictiveness. It appears, however,
that there is a peculiar race among them, of the
'squirearchical order, º characterised by
those defects and bad qualities, and unfortu-
nately invested, with judicial functions, which
they exercise, at Quarter Sessions—after what
fashion the subjoined extract from a newspaper
report will show:—
“BURY ST. EDMUND’S.
“County PETTY SEssroxs.-Cruelty to a Horse.—The
driver of a mail-cart from this town to Woolpit, was fined,
with expenses, 15s., for cruelly beating, near the latter
#. a horse which he was driving. The money not being
orthcoming, imprisonment for a fortnight was pronounced.
—Egg Poaching.—Two lads were sentenced to 2 months'
imprisonment each, for robbing a partridge's nest of two
eggs, at Stanningfield.”
Torturing a horse—a fortnight's imprison-
ment: poaching two eggs—two months' ditto.
This is the way the Suffolk Justices are accus-
tomed to compare great things with small. This
is how they keep the game alive. Two months'
tuition in real burglary, for robbing the nest of a
partridge | This sentence ought to be famous;
they who pronounced it, should never cease to
hear of it; whoever, therefore, invites one of
them to supper, must remember always to set
before his Lordship a dish of poached eggs.
A QUERY FOR THE FIRST CommissionER OF
Woods AnD FORESTS.
If Laws and Learning, Trade and Commerce, die,
Where then would be our old Nobility ?
OUR INSANE ARTIST.
We must again warn our readers—we mean the British Nation
generally—that this wretched individual is still at large... We are con-
serned to state that we have just had ocular proof of the distressing
fact. Scarce five minutes since, by our infallible P. edition of the
Horse Guards, we were “thrown into a state of considerable excite-
ment” (as our penny-a-liner would observe), by a thundering rat-tat-
TAT at the door; which, opening at our adjuration, to our horror
disclosed the person of our unhappy friend. For a moment he wildly
glared at us; and ere the second sped, his “eye in frenzy rolling,” had
transfixed us to our seat—as helpless as a humming-bird beneath the
stare of the serpent. Then, at a bound, he reached our side, snatched
the pen from our nerveless hand, and fiercely plunged it to the hilt in
our brimming inkstand. Resistance was hopeless; we were ocularly
entranced; completely electro-biologised, as it were, by one fatal coup!
* * * After a ſapse of about two minutes and aquarter, we slowly came
to ourself, and were rejoiced to find that our tormentor had vanished.
But, alas! our rapture was of brief duration; for a second and less
hasty glance informed us that the unhappy wretch had left us a horrible
souvenir of his advent. Perhaps, the sensitive reader may faintly con;
ceive our feelings, when we discovered that the especial sheet we had
selected, for one of our posterity-delighting articles was scrawled all
over with maniacal hieroglyphics, which, by . and a pair o
spectacles, we have at length succeeded in deciphering as follows:-
“Subject roR A Pictuak of CRUElry. — Our Zoological Artist drawing a

THE miscellaneous news of the Hampshire Independent contains the
statement that— -
“A lady who has officiated as organist at St. Mary's Church, Leamington, for

in the habit of giving public concerts | | | "

SATISFACTORY NEWS FROM INDIA.
If this periodical were a newspaper, in announcing another Burmese
war, Mr. Punch would have to express his regret at the intelligence
which he was obliged to publish. A brother journalist, however, of
Mr. Punch's, so far differs from, Mr. Punch as to consider it a piece of
capital news. The Delhi Gazette says:
“It is with great satisfaction that we announce the actual commencement of hos-
tilities with Burmah, and we shall be much disappointed if the Province of Pegu does
not now fall into our hands. Any expedition, however, against Ava, or anywhere into
the interior of the country, we must deprecate as both unnect ssary and injudicious. As
far as the sea line is concerned, we shall experience but little difficulty in makin
ourselves masters of it; but beyond this the climate will be an insuperable barrier, an
our gallant soldiers will perish by hundreds.”
Our Indian contemporary might as well adopt the plan of narrating
all calamities in the same spirit as that in which he notifies war. As
for instance:-We have much pleasure in intimating that a vacancy has
occurred in the 13th Bungaloes, in consequence of MAJOR CURRIE
having been thrown from his elephant whilst tiger-hunting, and having
broken his neck. It is with great gratification we present to our
readers an account of the murder committed by RUMMAGEE THUGGEE
on the body of LIEUTENANT GENERAL TIFFIN.—Why not record
murder and sudden death with as much “satisfaction” as battle?
The number of the Delhi Gazette, containing the very satisfactory
f| information of the commencement of hostilities with Burmah, and con-
sequently of the extreme probability that “our gallant soldiers will
erish by hundreds,” bears the date of SUNDAY, January 25, 1852.
The better the day, the better the deed, is perhaps a maxim that occurred
to the Editor when he penned, the above-quoted paragraph; unless,
indeed, his journal is a Mussulman organ, and, his sentiments, both
with respect to particular days of the week, and to “hostilities,” are
those of a gentleman of the Mahometan persuasion.
The Bishop of Durham's Purse.
THE Eraminer states, that,
“On Thursday night week, a couple of expert thieves effected an entrance into
Auckland Palace, while its inmates were all in bed. They found their way into the
room where the Bishop or DURHAM and MRs. MALTEY slept, and maua to retire,
carryin; with them the Bishop's purse, which, however, only contained about three
pounds.
The purse that “only contained three pounds,” cannot have been that
purse which the BISHOP or DURHAM is said to have made out of his see.

DONNYBROOK FAIR UNDER THE NEW LORD LIEUTENANT.
A LAZARUS FOR ALL WEATHERS.
A CHEAP luxury for the benevolent man is set forth by way of
advertisement in the Times. Here it is:—
Fº SALE, that most beautiful piece of Work of Art, the FIGURE of
LAZARUS and PEDESTAL, fit for a gentleman's hall or lawn; made of patent
Portland Cement. Warranted to stand all weathers. To be sold a great bargain. For
particulars and to view apply to
What a mouthful is here—sweet and melting as ripest peach—for a
sort of philanthropy to be found in all times T A LazARUs that—the
first expense of purchase past; the cost of making LAzARUs our own—
shall mulct us of no further penny; shall remain in imperishable cement,
a touching lesson in our hall, or upon our green-sward; shall never
blister in the dog-days, or shiver in December; but stand all weathers;
an uncomplaining model LAZARUs—and, moreover, a LAZARUs a great
bargain! A rare penn'orth this, in which economy may be spiced with
a sort of human tenderness. -
LAZARUs in the hall, calm in his Fº cement, has his fixed look of
meek .* and does not sniff with in-drawn vitals as roast and boiled
pass into the dining-room: his eye does not wander, whetting itself
upon decanters glowing with ruby and topaz. Portland lazARUs
cannot by the least twitch of feature betray a homespun impatience of
things, the fattest and the strongest, passing before him; thereby,
whether he will or no—as will happen with a LAzARUs in the flesh-
saucily arraigning the wise behests of all-balancing Fortune. , No:
Portland LAZARUs and his owner are well acquainted; they know,
with equal knowledge, one another. Cement i flesh are old friends.
The master knows LAZARUs as compassionately, as plaster LAzARUs
can, with , grateful tenderness, acknowledge, his benefactor. For
LAZARUs has been bought a bargain; and the purchaser shows his
sympathy with suffering, by giving it a place under his roof, or in the
very eye of his casement.
And how many of us own a LAZARUs of this dumb, uncomplaining
species—an ornamental LAZARUs that no respectable Christian can be
without? How many of us confess to the appealing sorrow of LAzARUs,
as wrought by The MASTER; how many who are touched, melted, by the
divine beauty of the work, prizing it as finest art—a thing of abstract
loveliness, with no hard existence; sublime art, without the coarse
reality of pulses?
And after this fashion folks—who even dream not of such a possession
—sacrifice to the human necessities of their LAZARus. They know the
marvellous workmanship of LAZARUs. And with such acknowledgment,
LAzARUs may adorn their hall, or upon their well-swept lawn defy the
seasons, being a LAZARUs wanting nothing; indeed, a LAZARUs
warranted to stand all weathers.
UPON THEMI CHARGE | BUT DON'T OWERCHARGE.
WE are not remarkable for modesty, or for a want of appreciation of
our own value; but there are some people who will insist on putting
a higher price upon us than we put upon ourselves; and who charge
fourpence for us while we are satisfied to make the moderate demand
of threepence on the public pocket. WALPoLE—not the present Home
Secretary, but a far less honest man than he appears to be—has said
that every man has, and of course, therefore, knows, his price; but it
seems we do not know our own, for at the Great Western Railway
Station they will insist upon putting twenty-five per cent. upon the
estimate we have formed of ourselves. Now we should have no objec-
tion, perhaps, to this arrangement, if the tax on the public were paid over
to us; but unfortunately it is added to the very liberal profit we already
allow to the Booksellers out of the threepence at which the whole world
delights to purchase us. The extra twenty-five per cent., without
affording the smallest advantage to ourselves, is a clear loss to the
travellers by the Great Western, who are frequently much irritated by
the vexatious impost, which thus becomes the madness of many for the
gain of-one.
Dilapidation Extraordinary.
A NewsPAPER, in stating that the present pavement of Holborn,
from Little Turnstile eastwards towards Chancery Lane, is to be
exchanged for granite, thus remarks—
“The thoroughfare has long been in a dangerous state, owing to the dilapidated
condition of the wood pavement.”
Etymology suggests that a wood pavement, to be in a dilapidated
condition, must first have become petrified; or have been constructed
of Irish timber.

COLONEL SIBTHORP ON CHRISTIAN CHARITY.
URING the debate
on the Corrupt
Practices at Elec-
tions Bill, the gal-
lant ColoneLSIB-
Thorp protested
against it, on the
ground that it is
calculated “to re-
strain men from
acts of Christian
charity.” His no-
tions of Christian
charity were then
exemplified by the
observation, that
“if a Member
gave an elector a
- º pinch of snuff, it
º would soonbecom-
Tº º sidered bribery.”
- - --- Of course the gal-
lºſſº lant Colonel pre-
º sumes that the
EPF worthy elector
will be thoroughly
up to snuff, and
that a candidate's
offering to serve him at a pinch, is nothing more than an act of Chris-
tian charity. We suspect that “the effects of Christian charity,” as
shown by the influences which the Bill is designed to check, would form
a melancholy picture of helpless inebriety, and other forms of moral
degradation, too deep, or at all events too low, to go into. It is unfor-
tunate for the gallant Colonel's argument, that the charity he recom-
mends involves the necessity for the aid of all the publicans, and a
great many of the sinners, in a place where an election is going on, to
dispense its offerings. -
After making his protest, the Colonel was content to exclaim, “Let
the Bill pass,” as if he had confidence in the belief that his ideas of
Christian charity at an election may still be carried out in spite of the
proposed, measure. The air of jaunty indifference with which, this
exclamation seems to have been made—the contemptuous monchalance
with which the Colonel cried, “Let the Bill pass”—reminds us so
much of SHERIDAN's song with its "Let the Toast pass,” by way of
refrain, that we cannot refrain from a parody:
Here's to the Voter whose terms are fifteen;
Here’s to the vote that costs fifty;
Here’s to the Candidate shabby and mean,
And here’s to the one that’s not thrifty.
Let the Bill pass;
'Tis but a farce;
I warrant they’ll find an excuse for a glass.
Here’s to the Voter whose freehold we prize,
Here’s to the tenant with none, Sir;
Here’s to the host who the liquor supplies,
Here’s to the beer-taps that run, Sir;
Let the Bill pass, &c.
Here's to the Candidate, pure as the snow,
With an Agent as black as a berry;
Here's to the Wife with a face full of woe,
And here’s to the bribe makes her merry.
Let the Bill pass, &c.
For let them be clumsy, or cautiously trim,
Snug or open, I care not a feather;
So fill all the pewter-pots up to the brim,
And let both sides get drunk altogether.
Let the Bill pass,
He’s but an ass,
Who's puzzled to find an excuse for a glass.
Legal Caution.
We are instructed to state, for the benefit of such of our country clients
as may now be visiting, this Metropolis, that the “Cheap Conveyance
Association” they may have seen announced on some of the Holborn
Qmnibuses, has no connection whatever with the Society for Law
Reform they may have elsewhere seen advertised.
Count AND FAshion.—Why is the “Windsor Uniform” like a
prepaid letter? Because it has a Post Office Stamp.
MILITARY.
AsHoRT time ago, under cloak of the Cape expedition, the Carbineers
were turned into fight cavalry at a heavy expense. As it now appears to
be doubtful whether the Cape will be their destination, we sº that
on the principle that one good turn deserves another, they will be again
turned into light. It is very easy to talk of turning light into heavy or
heavy into light, but how is it to be done? It may be true enough
that a King (or Queen) can make a bold dragoon, a carbineer, “and a”
that;” but how the size or weight of dragoons is to be altered when
they are made, is a question which, we confess, puzzles, us. On first
consideration, sweating (as in the case of jockeys) suggested itself to us
as a probable means of converting heavy into light; but we make
light of this suggestion when we consider that the process would
robably weaken as well as lighten. Perhaps, as Samson's strength lay
in his hair, a dragoon's weight may lie in his: in such case, the mous-
tache might be sacrificed with advantage, . By-the-bye we would
venture to give a hint with respect to the clothing of the cavalry. Might
not the padding of the coats—which is supposed to be so essential to
the “smartness” of a dragoon, and which is such a great auxiliary in
the conquest of servant-maids when on home service, but so great, a
hindrance to the free action of the limbs when in action—might not the
padding be made of gun cotton instead of the usual wadding?, The
unsightly pouches might thus be got rid of, and the soldier would feel
the looser and, more fit for fighting every shot that was fired. To be
sure, there is the chance that dragoon, coat, and gun cotton might be
all blown up together. But we only throw out a hint: we leave it to
practical men to improve on it.

MILK REFORM.
HE milk-tester is making rapid
strides into the milk-cans and
milk-jugsofthemetropolis, which
has too long confided in those
chalky deposits, which tally only
too well with the chalk employed
by the vendor in scoring what
he calls his milk tally. The ad-
vance of the milk-tester has
thrown cold water on the pros-
º of many a milk man, and
ept a great deal of cold water
out of the fluid supplied to his
customers.
We understand that the pos-
sibility of being able to test the
genuineness of milk has already
occasioned a sort of coolness be-
tween those old associates, the
cow and the pump, who have,
hitherto, gone hand-in-hand upon
nearly every London, milk-walk.
The milk-tester will act as a
sort of Protection to the cow,
by preventing the free introduc-
tion of those foreign ingredients
which have, hitherto, formed the
; most considerable portion of
the lacteal compound sold to the
Londoners.
We are extremely happy to witness the dissolution of a partnership,
in which the cow has been at the disadvantage of supplying all the
sterling capital, while the pump has only brought disgrace upon the
firm by a copious issue of drafts of the most discreditable character.
The cow has, for years, been “draining its dearest veins,” and
exhausting all its resources on, a dishonourable connection with a
Pump, which has been, all along, lending a handle to a system of fraud
and trickery. In fact, so disreputable has the alliance been between
the Pump and the Cow, that milk-and-watery has become a term
applicable to anything especially weak and contemptible.

New Order of Knighthood for Ancient Britons.
“MR. Punch,-A Chapter of the Order of the Thistle, look you,
was held the other day. Now, there is a herb, and a pretty plant it is
to ſ'. in gardens, and pleasant to smell, and, moreover, is an esculent
and wholesome vegetable, and whatever the Scotch may say, I will
maintain and contend that it is much better than any thistle. 1
beseech you, then, to tell me the causes and the reasons and the argu-
ments why, since there is an Order of the Thistle, there should not
also be an order of the Leek in honour to the native’land of "Tºry.”
PROTECTIONIST MEASURES.
We believe, in the phraseology of the Bar, that it is not unusual to
hear an crder of “A Quartern and Three Outs.” Now, only let the
present Ministers increase the price of bread, and they will very
quickly hear a cry raised against them of “The Quartern and All Out.”
“TO BE SOLD-THE CRYSTAL PALACE | *
We could scarcely believe the evidence of our senses, when in
passing our pet Palace the other morning we saw a couple of huge
posters stuck upon its south-transeptal doors, inscribed respectively
with this breath-suspending
* Notice.
“SALE of the CrystAL PALACE, in Lots. Cards to view may be obtained at the
Building, South Entrance.”
We thought at first we were the victims of a distressing optical
illusion, and we rubbed our eyes most vigorously to restore them to
their natural state. But our energy was futile: and a second glance
assured us that it was no illusion, but a painful fact. In vain we then
tried to persuade ourselves we were standing in Dream-land, and not
Hyde Park—in vain we endeavoured to imagine that somebod had
chloroformed or electro-biologised us unawares. The startling syllables
assailed us still: and although we nearly rubbed ourselves into a state
of ocular lidlessness, alas! we could not rub that dreadful “Notice”
out: nor by the strongest effort of credulity could we believe that
we were duped by a mischievous misprint, and that in reality it was a
Sell, not a Sale, that troubled us.
We are not naturally cowards. We believe that in case of Invasion,
we should be found to do our duty as England might “expect.” But
we own we flinched from asking for a “card to view.” We confess
we wanted courage to pop that dreadful question. Qur nerves were
too severely shattered by the first, to risk the danger of a second shock.
No—let the stronger-minded go, and bravely know the worst. Enough
for us to warm the Nation of its favourite's impending fate. Enough
for us to say that the Death-warrant is now actually in print, and that
speedy intercession alone can cancel it. Already in our mind's eye we
see the sentence carried out. Already in our mental ear we catch the
ominous words “ ºfº. It rests with the Public
Voice to say if the fatal monosyllable be added—“GONE!”
Paxton forfend! that our Crystal Palace, after so bravely with-
standing the storms of a SIBThorp, should now be ignominiously
“knocked down” by a common Appraiser's hammer!
THE MINISTERIAL CORN-CUTTER.
MR. BENAMIN DISRAELI begs leave to inform his friends and the
public, that having removed to new premises in Downing Street, he is
now in a situation to put in practice those principles for the treatment
of every kind of Corn, which he has !"; made his constant study.
MR. DisrAELI no longer recommends his former mode of practice, by
striking at the root; but he proposes to give ease by an equalisation of
the burdens on the Corn, when he has ascertained where the shoe
pinches.
MR. DisrAELI is happy to have it in his power to lay before the
public the following valuable Testimonials:-
“From the RIGHT Honour ABLE THE EARL of DERby.
“MR. DisrAELI has very skilfully managed the Corn with which 1
was troubled, so that I do not at present suffer any inconvenience.
* “DERBY.”
“From an Agriculturist.
“MR.DIsrAELI hearing me complainfrequently of Corn, has operated
i. my understanding so skilfully, that I sometimes do not appear to
ave any.”
“From a Protectionist.
“I BEG to say, that I am the party that has always been crying out on
the subject of Corn, and that if it had not been for MR. Disraeli, I
should not have had a leg to stand upon.”
Political Colours.
As a general election is nigh at hand, it may be seasonable to suggest
that if parties would adopt a greater diversity of colours, not confining
those political emblems to “blue and buff,” they would encourage
trade, please the taste for variety, and more correctly symbolise their
respective shades of opinion. The men of peace principles might
decorate themselves with drab ribbons; flºº favours would
be proper for the “Irish Brigade,” and the rest of the Papal party;
green would suit the simple agricultural interest: and the out-and-
out Protectionists should hoist the black flag.
“ENGLAND's NAVAL RESERVE.”
A PARAGRAPH, with the above heading, has been sailing through the
papers. The only “Naval Reserve" on the part of England that we
are aware of, is in not speaking out loudly against the gross mis-
management of our Navy by the Lords of the Admiralty.

THE GHOSTS ON THE VICTORIA TOWER.
*TIs twelve o’clock by St. Margaret’s bell,
And the ghosts of St. Margaret's burial-ground
(You may know the locality by the smell)
Are beginning to rise for their midnight round.
Parliament Street is dreary and dead,
And hollow falls the policeman's tread
And well-doing people are warm in bed;
Only there’s waking in Westminster slum,
And Broadway tavern, and Pye Street den,
Where the flaring gaslights fitfully come
On slatternly drabs and ruffianly men;
And there’s Wºlf, too, of another sort,
In another house of doubtful report,
Where the Commons are met, and the Speaker is set,
With some little bills to dispose of yet;
And the Members are feeling excessively ill,
With BARRY's alternate hot-blast and chill;
And the head-achy lamps burn hot and hotter,
And talkative M.P.s prose and potter,
And weary reporters doze at their notes,
And tired-out Tellers miscount the votes;
But every one feels that it’s no great matter
In the part of the evening called “the latter,”
For it’s only the Estimates that they’re voting,
And “how the money goes” needs no noting.
O'erhead, enjoying the hush of the hour,
Two Ghosts sit upon the Victoria Tower—
And it needs no conjuror to reveal
They’re the Ghosts of BENTINck and Robert PEEL,
Still haunting the spot, by leave of the Fates,
To take posthumous notes of the Commons’ debates,
And discuss, as they did in the days that are gone,
Of Free Trade and Protection the pro and con.
Says the Ghost of PEEL, “You’re bound to admit
My Free Trade measures have been a hit;
Capital’s gathering cent. per cent.”—
“That’s true,” quoth BENTINCK's Ghost, “but RENT' "
Says the Ghost of PEEL, “The Revenue's rising
In a style that, even to me, is surprising;
Our imports increase to a vast extent”—
“That’s true,” quoth BENTINCK's Ghost; “but RENT .. "
Quoth the Ghost of PEEL, “It plainly appears,
Five million taxes have gone in six years;
And yet there’s a surplus—that is, there was meant
To have been one; but to the Cape it went”—
“That’s true,” quoth BENTINck’s Ghost; “but RENT 1"
uoth the Ghost of PEEL, “Since Forty-two
We’ve doubled Consumption and Exports, too;
And somehow we eat all the food that's sent *—
“That’s true,” quoth BENTINck’s Ghost; “but RENT ..."
Quoth the Ghost of PEEL, “Our wages keep up;
The poor have cheap sugar to sweeten their cup,
And a bigger and lower-priced loaf to eat,
And a larger allowance of butcher's meat;
In short, all is plenty, peace, and content”—
“That's true;’ quoth BENTINck’s Ghost; “but RENT ... "
Quoth the Ghost of PEEL, “This is really too strong—
Is there no other burden but this to your song 2
To answer my reasons I thought you meant.”—
“RENT | * Quoth BENTINck’s Ghost, “RENT | | RENT | | |
RENT | | | | RENT | | | | | *
Whereat, with a frown of his shadowy brow,
The Ghost of PEEL made a stiffish bow.
“I see,” quoth he, “’tis answer enow.—
For in those four letters is summed the reply
To all the figures and facts that lie
In Revenue tables and Custom House tomes,
In employers' ledgers, and workmen's homes;
In those four letters is writ the doom
Of the party that rallies around your tomb:
And 'twere well for England were that the worst
That is written in those four letters accurst.
But more is in them—there’s civil strife,
And war betwixt classes—yea, war to the knife;
Election orgies, and aimless debate,
And rich men's scorn, and poor men's hate;
And it may be there’s writ at the bottom of all,
In those four letters—your order's fall!
Oh! woe to me, and woe to you,
If ever these words of mine come true—
But, on England's tomb, in that grievous event,
You may carve the four letters that make up RENT1"
The voices ceased—the moon-beams fall,
i.e. the roof of Westminster Hall;
But, still, on the night-wind moaning went
A dying murmur of RENT, RENT, RENT:
As the rival Ghosts to their tombs returned,
Their midnight sessions duly adjourned.

HABITS OF THE BUSINESS-MEMBER OF
PARLIAMENT.
| HE Business-Mem-
ber of Parliament
is one who gets
into Parliament
for his own busi-
mess, and not the
business of the
country.
A lavish distri-
bution of promises
previous to elec-
tion, which are
rarely fulfilled
after it, forms one
of the most de-
cided habits of
this Member of
Parliament.
Beyond this he
is most strict in
keeping his en-
gagements.
Receives voters
from the country
in the most cor-
dial manner, if
there is any
rumour of a dis-
solution.
Wotes with his
party—not, as he thinks, but as his party thinks.
iyoesn't listen to the debates—it might prejudice him.
Infinitely prefers his chop at BELLAMy's. -
Of all parties, likes an evening party best, next to a dinner-party.
Thinks a seat in the House precious hard work—so hard, that unless
a Financial Debate is going on, it is impossible to sleep upon it.
Belongs to a Club, of course—very convenient for his letters, and
safe retreat from country visitors. “MR. EMPPIE at home, Sir P”
“No, Sir. Gone to the Club.” - -
lººds a Committee, when compelled, and writes his correspondence
there.
Never suffers his mind to be confused, by allowing an argument for
one minute to dwell upon it.
Keeps his thoughts and opinions from the view of others, by never
speaking a word. -
Is most loud and explicit, however, whenever he cries “Hear!”
Leaves nothing of consequence to memory which he can and ought to
º to writing; so, in asking for an appointment, he always writes
in for it.
Never forgets a service he pays the Government.
Never omits to tell the Government so. -
Keeps a memorandum-book, in which he notes every appointment or
º that is likely to be vacant, and with the price attached
to each.
Likes an ambassadorship best, along way off, where there is little to
do, no one to know how you do it, and a good liberal sum given for it.
is equally obliging in attending and leaving the House; but greatly
prefers the latter. - -
Holds that a vote is a sacred obligation, which no Member should
part with lightly before he has seriously considered how it is likely to
affect his interests." -
Balances regularly the state of parties, and serves that party with
the greatest zeal which has the most to give.
Holds it as a maxim that that Government is not worthy to be
supported which does not support its own followers.
Coughs, barks, brays, crows, neighs, on the shortest notice, as a
matter of course. -
Let the Business-Member of Parliament act strictly to these habits,
and he must succeed.
He must try his hardest, do his strongest, and take whatever comes.
THE NEW Tories.—The Tories of the present day, inasmuch as they
represent the territorial interest, may be called the Terri-tories.

THE DANGEROUS ANIMALS BILL.
We do not wonder at the Government opposition to this Bill; for
if the Ministers undertake to deal with dangerous animals, they may
asked what they intend to do with the few remaining rabid Protec-
tionists. One of the clauses had reference to farmers keeping savage
bulls; but though the farmers have really been enough to make John
BULL rather savage at times, it is only by putting restrictions upon
him that he is likely to become a dangerous animal. There was a
little fun caused by the ATToRNEY GENERAL during the debate, but the
report might have been richer, and we therefore supply a few of the
principal omissions.
CoLonel SIBTHORP, hearing that rabid animals might be destroyed
according to the present law, wished to know whether that mad wag|th
Punch might not at once be destroyed as a dangerous animal.
MR. DRUMMOND would be glad to know if the Pope's insane bulls
might not be included in the measure.
MR. ALDERMAN HUMPHERY would suggest that March Hares
should have a clause devoted to them.
MR. Roebuck had personally, no objection to the Bill; indeed, he
would carry it farther, and would introduce a provision for helping a
lame, dog over a stile, which he thought would be a suggestion of
which Ministers would be glad to avail themselves.
CoLonEL SIBTHORP was anxious for information as to the clause
relating, to dog-carts, which he understood to be already in operation
within the Metropolis. Now, several military friends of {. embers
of the House—were in the habit of coming down to that House in
#:". though he was sure they would not wilfully incur a penalty
ear).
CoLoREL, THOMPson feared that the House did not understand the
Subject of dogs. If there were any idle puppies sauntering about the
~
lobbies, they might have their attention profitably employed upon the
question (A laugh, a very faint one).
After a few words from MR. Pack, who, speaking in the character of
is a whole Pack, could claim some sympathy for poor unfortunate dogs,
the subject dropped for the present.
THE RITE OF HANGING.
ON Monday, last week, a remarkable execution took place.
“WILLIAM KALABEago this morning suffered the extreme penalty of the law, over
the Chapel, at the County Gaol at Oxford."
Thus writes the reporter of the Times, and he subsequently states
at—
“The procession to the place of execution. assed down the cell stairs, across the yard,
and up into the Chapel, in which, in front of the communion-table, the pinioning took place."
Authority, then, has, once for all, pronounced its decision on the
question of capital punishment. It has declared the execution of a
criminal to be not º or merely just, but a holy solemnity.
What else are we to think, now that at Oxford, the very seat of ortho:
doxy, a man has been hanged over a Chapel, after having been pinioned
in front of the communion-table P
Parliamentary Privacy.
If Louis NAPOLEoN wishes thoroughly to stifle the discussion, and
to prevent the publication of the debates that occur in his Senate and
Legislative corps, he should cause the Chambers in which those bodies
meet, to be constructed and ventilated after the fashion of the British
Houses of Parliament; so that the assembly might be close, and the
speakers inaudible in the gallery.

SHALL MORISON HAWE A MONUMENT P
THIs question is being put almost daily to the “People of England”
in a series of advertisements; and as the parties concerned are doing
all they can to turn it into a public question, they cannot blame us for
saying a word or two in reply to it. We have no hesitation in saying,
by all means let MoRISON have a Monument; and we go even further,
for we beg leave to offer a design, which the MoRIsosiaNs are quite
at liberty to adopt if they think it appropriate. We recommend its
construction, not of ordinary, stone, but of the very stoutest “monu-
mental brass,” that being the material most in character with the
intended object. .
|As the advertising columns of the papers are daily teeming with
REASONs WHY A MONUMENT SHOULD BE ERECTED,
We think ourselves at perfect liberty to add a few Reasons of our
own, which have, perhaps, not occurred to those in whose hands the
affair has hitherto rested.
1. Hºus MoRISON was one of the most remarkable pillers of
society.
2. Because he had a thorough knowledge of what his fellow-creatures
would swallow.
3. Because he sent forth his pills in numbers, and Number One was
the chief object of his solicitude,
4. Because he was engaged in a great struggle, and dealt out many a
death blow in pursuit of his object.
We might add some special reasons why the Monument we have
designed should be the one selected; but it may be sufficient to say
that he contributed to numerous undertakings, and that his eulogy can
be most appropriately conveyed in Mute eloquence.
The Female Franchise.
IN the House of Commons, speaking on MR. HUME's Reform
motion, MR. NAPIER is reported to have said—
“It was proposed that the franchise should be given to all persons of 21 years of
age, who laboured under no mental or legal disability. Why, then, as had been
asked before, should ladies be excluded?”
1. Because there is no evidence that any lady is twenty-one years of
age; inasmuch as no lady will ever tell what her age is.
2. Because, as a poet says of the softer sex, “Angels are painted
fair to look like them; ” so that they are already represented fairly
enough in all conscience.
WILL Shortly Close.—The St. Stephen's Exhibition of Unprofit.
able Discussion and Empty Debate.
LOUIS NAPOLEON'S LAST.
(FOR THE PRESENT.)
IN our position of Moniteur to the public in general, we proceed to
publish the following Decree, which will be found the same in spirit, if
}. §: uniform in text, with the document just issued by the French
resident.
Louis NAPOLEON, *.*.*. but himself, proceeds to
regulate the relations of the Legislative Bodies or nobodies with
himself, though he will respect no relationship as permanent or binding
upon him, except his own relationship of nephew to his uncle the
Emperor.
THE COUNCIL OF STATE.
The Council of State will be in a state of thorough submission
to Louis NAPOLEoN, who will send to them the work they are to do,
which will prevent the necessity for their calling for orders at Louis
NAPOLEON's residence.
MEETING OF THE SENATE.
The Senate meets when Louis NApoleoN pleases; and the Senate
will cease to meet when it displeases Louis NAPOLEon.
BILLS.
As the duty of the Senate is only to accept Louis NAPOLEoN's
Bills, the Senate will not be allowed to make any alterations in the
form or value of any Bill offered for its acceptance by Louis NAPOLEON.
PROPOSITIONS TO MODIFY THE CONSTITUTION.
A proposition to modify the Constitution must be signed by ten
Senators at least, and must be sent, to Louis NAPOLEoN, who will
decide on the matter according to Art. 31, or any other Art that he
may choose to exercise.
PLACE OF MEETING OF THE SENATE.
The residence in the Rue d'Enfer is devoted to the Senate: or the
Senate is devoted to the Rue d'Enfer, as the most appropriate place for
it, in the opinion of Louis NAPOLEoN.
OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY.
Bills will be presented to the Legislative Body by Louis NAPOLeon;
and, if any amendment should be proposed, it must be sent to Louis
NApoleon through his clerks, or Ministers, and, if his opinion is
unfavourable, the amendment will be null and void.
MESSAGES AND PROCLAMATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE LEGISLATIVE
BODY.
As the messages or proclamations of Louis NAPOLEoN are intended
to be obeyed and not talked about, no message or proclamation is to be
discussed or voted upon, unless by order of Louis, NAPOLEoN. A
proclamation of Louis NAPOLEon dissolving the Legislative Body is to
put an end to everything and everybody in the Legislature, which is
to separate at the first blow, without any attempt to collect itself.
No Member is to speak without leave, and then only from his place;
but every observation will be treated as out of place if it is distasteful
to louis NAPOLEON. - -
All signs of disapprobation and approbation are interdicted—so that
laughing at a joke, or yawning at a dull debate, are not allowed to the
French Legislature. -
If the Assembly becomes tumultuous, the PRESIDENT may put on his
hat, and remain covered himself until he can recover his authority.
MINUTES.
As what the Members say will be of very little moment, it will be
confined to the briefest possible minutes, comprising merely the name
of the speaker and how he voted.
Any Member, if the Assembly will allow him, may print his own
speech, at his own cost; but it will be difficult to calculate the cost if it
contain anything distasteful to Louis NAPOLEoN.
DoNE (again) MARCH 22nd, by Louis NAPOLEon.
Free-will for Testators.
“WHERE there’s a will there’s a way,” says the proverb; but the
existing state of the law of wills, which renders a testament invalid if
it happens to have been signed a hair's breadth over an inch from the
bottom, upsets this axiom of F. philosophy in many cases, by
giving no way to the will of the testator. The LQRD, CHANCEllor is
therefore greatly to be thanked for havin º a bill through the
Lords to abolish this º so wretched in itself, and causing so
much wretchedness; and should the measure happily become law, it
will be a fine feather in the new coronet.of LoRD ST, LEONARD's. This
is a good beginning on the part of the Tories, and if they go on in the
same way, their Ministry will perhaps be more than transi-tory.

AN ERROR IN JUDGMENTP
SURELY there must have been some mistake in the newspaper report
of the case of CHARLotte LARKIN, widow, aged 42, indicted at the
Lewes Assizes, before MR. JUSTICE ColeRIDGE, for the manslaughter
t º: son, Thomas LARKIN, a child 10 months old. We find it stated
al-
“This was one of those cases so frequently occurring in the country, where the deaths
of children have been occasioned by the administration of narcotics sold under differ-
ent names to the poorer classes for the purpose of ‘soothing’ their children. . * *
* * * * The prisoner was proved to have always previously exhibited great
fondness for the child, and there was no ground for supposing that she had any idea of the
dangerous consequences that were likely to ensue from her conduct.
“She was found Guilty, and sentenced to three months' hard labour.”
There must, we repeat, be some mistake in this report; for there
ought to be no mistake in the supposition, that the Lewes jury were
men of common sense and common º: and there can be none in
the general impression that MR. Justice CoIERIDGE is precisely the
reverse of an unjust and merciless Judge. Such a sentence as the above
on such facts, is simply an aggravation of natural anguish; a perfectly
unreasonable and cruel addition of punishment to the sorrow a mother
must feel at having had the misfortune to lose her child through a
mistaken attempt to comfort it.
If an error in the administration of a remedy, because it happens to
be fatal, is to be punished with imprisonment and hard labour, we had
better leave the sick and the suffering to die a natural death, without
meddling with them. . Medical men, in particular, will do well to give
up practice; because in their case an error in judgment will of course
be considered peculiarly inexcusable.
Suppose not, good people, for one moment, that we defend the
º of mothers drugging their children with laudanum. Abomina-
le is the only word for it in our dictionary. But, by leave of the
CIIANcellor of THE Exchequer, the women are not the culprits.
Other parties, surely, are to be blamed for this poisonous quackery,
when ignorant females are encouraged to administer narcotics to infants,
and thus cause those lamentable “cases so frequently occurring in the
country,” by the sale of “soothing ” “elixirs,” “carminatives,” and
“syrups,” sanctioned and recommended by the Gover NMENT STAMP.

STEWED DUCK AND PEAS.
Ana—“My Heart and Lute."
I Give thee all, I can no more,
Though poor the dinner be:
Stew’d Duck and Peas are all the store
That I can offer thee.
A Duck, whose tender breast reveals
Its early youth full well;
And, better still, a Pea that peels
From fresh transparent shell.
Though Duck and Peas may fail, alas!
One's hunger to allay;
At least for luncheon they may pass,
The appetite to stay. -
If season'd Duck an odour bring
From which one would abstain, .
The Peas like fragrant breath of Spring
Set all to rights again.
I give thee all my kitchen lore,
#. poor the offering be;
I’ll tell thee how 'tis cook'd, before
You come to dine with me:
The Duck is truss'd from head to heels,
Then stew’d with butter well;
And streaky bacon, which reveals
A most delicious smell.
When Duck and Bacon in a mass
You in the stewpan lay,
A spoon around the vessel pass,
And gently stir away:
A table-spoon of flour bring,
A quart of water plain,
Then in it twenty onions fling,
And gently stir again.
A bunch of parsley, and a leaf
Of ever-verdant bay, -
Two cloves—I make my language brief-
Then add your Peas you may!
And let it simmer till it sings
In a delicious strain: -
Then take your Duck, nor let the strings
For trussing it remain.
The parsley fail not to remove,
Also the leaf of bay; -
Dish up your iſſuck—the sauce improve
In the accustom'd way, -
With pepper, salt, and other things,
I need not here explain:
And, if the dish contentment brings,
You’ll dine with me again.
“What Cheek!”
THE King of the Amazons, we read, replies to LoRD PALMeRston,
that the presents sent to His Majesty by UEEN VICTORIA, “are very
acceptable, and are good for his face.” If MEssRs. Rowland do not
instantly announce that the presents in question were bottles of
“Kalydor,” they will throw away an excellent chance.
ELECTIONEERING PROSPECTS.
The Free Traders look forward with confidence to the results of the
next election, and yet, most probably, the landlords will be the chief
gainers by it—unless it is attended by much less than the usual amount
of drunkenness.
Papal Dealings with the Court.
So the presentation of MR. SHERIFF Swift's Chaplain, “Mon-
signoke.” SEARLE, at the QUEEN's levee, has been cancelled, and the
LoRD CHAMBERLAIN has sent back the reverend foreign titular on his
atron's hands. MR. Swift has found that he has done the Pope's
usiness at Court to the effect of small profit and quick returns.

The contest here will be severe, as the EARL of CAMBERweLL, who owns one-half of the
borough, has just obtained a good lump of money by mortgaging the parish of Quaggington;
while the DowageR LADY PECKHAM (his lordship's cousin and particular enemy), who owns
the other half, has given notice to every one of her tenants, that if the EARL's candidate
be returned, she will raise all their rents twenty-five per cent. A spirited struggle is therefore
certain, but it is thought that the Earl's ready money will carry the day.
º ſ
SQUASHBOROUGH.
Politics here are curiously involved. The “Staggering Sparrows,” a club which has
hitherto carried the elections its own way, has met a sudden and well-organised rivalry in a
new union called the “Downey Robin Redbreasts” (who took their name from the red
waistcoat of a smart auctioneer, their Perpetual Grand), and who, it is said, have exchanged
an electric message with the great MR. CoPPERAs, of London. The Sparrows stand well
with the Corporation, from using the Bung Tavern, #. by the Mayor; but there are two
benefit societies, the “Heroes of Glory,” and the “United Anti-Procrastinators,” both in
the Redbreast interest. Unless some arrangement can be made, the welfare of the *:
borough public will be sacrificed, and, a candidate, who has notoriously nothing but a
miserable eight hundred a-year, earned by his labours at the bar, will carry off the prize.
We hope better things from the good sense of both parties.
THE FANTAIL BURGHS.
There will be no battle this time. SIR PETER McGRAWLER, of Fishmaws, in whose hands
the representation lies, had threatened ejection and ruin to any voter who should support
young MR. BLEAK. But the latter havin º: for Miss MARGARETTA. McGRAwleR
(and his uncle, ALDERMAN TUNNIE, of The Loaches, having, undertaken to see to the
settlements), Sir PFTER has sent a circular ordering the electors to return his intended
son-in-law by acclamation.
BISHOP's CROTCHET.
uiet little town will be disturbed by the bustle of election. The Honourable
UMBLE PLUMB, the esteemed dowager heiresses, are so indignant that the townsfolk
objected to the sermons at St. Sillery's being preached in Latin, as º: by the Reverend
ORIGEN ALTARFLoweRs (the ladies' Puseyite chaplain), that they ave desired their nephew,
CAPTAIN FitzdeBBY, of the Guards, to come down and . the old Member, MR. JAMEs
BASKETwork. The latter made his fortune in the town, and spends it there; and though not
the wisest man in, the world, is considered a better representative of the honest folk of
Bishop's Crotchet than a “spangled officer.” But the old ladies are on their mettle, and a
costly struggle is commencing.

Again a Saxon insult | How long, O Nemesis of the West, how long P. The new proprietor
of Mount Target, a London merchant, a vile trader, has dared to issue an address, asking
the suffrages of the Killcrockery electors. And this because he has reclaimed an estate, once
an Irish gentleman's, from ruin, rebuilt the dilapidated mansion, and fed, with his wretched
gold, some hundreds of starving peasants. On such grounds does the dastardly PopKINs

thusiasm, from their merit, and from the noble

will go to the poll, and we need hardly add that
both his rivals will have to draw pretty largely
upon their dearly-loved gold. We congratulate
our townsmen that their cause is in good hands.
Votes will command twenty-five per cent. more
this time than ever before, and, besides, MR. DE
SLAck.JAw's speeches are oratorical treats of no
common order.
BALLYWOBBLE.
A difficulty has arisen in finding a second can-
didate, MAJob SNAPshot, of Rifleton, having
taken a solemn oath to wing anybody who comes
down to canvass against him. This he calls
taking a triggernometrical survey of his position.
The Major attends a meeting of his constituents
at the Bombshell Hotel every evening, and in
the most affable manner answers all inquiries as
to his political aims, by snuffing out candles with
his pistols. He pledges himself not to miss his
man; objects to the ballot because he likes to
see where his ball goes, but is otherwise well
disposed to the levellers. He is for popular
education, thinking the young idea ought to
be taught to shoot, and is very sarcastic on
milder people, whom he calls Šm. Bores.
Under the circumstances, his return seems
probable.

O a lover of comfort,
Life in Paris, when
a Revolution is
breaking all your
windows, and you
are lying down flat
on the floor to avoid
the shower of bul-
lets, is not very
pleasant.
Life in a Govern-
ment Transport,
with a scarcity of
water and º
but GoLDNER's pro-
visions on board,
cannot be very
agreeable either.
Life in a back-
parlour at Isling-
ton is not very
cheering; or Life in
: Ireland in a district
where they have a
weakness, justabout
quarter-day, of
shooting, not the
moon, but the land-
lord instead, cannot
be exactly the high-
est attainment of human happiness;–but still we think any one of
them is MAHOMET's Paradise itself, (providing, of course, you escape
dying, or being killed), compared to the LIFE IN AN OMNIBus with
twelve insides, two babies, a birdcage, a dog, and a washerwoman
smelling strongly of rum and yellow soap Iſ DANTE had been
alive at the present day, (and we can only regret he is not), he would
certainly have placed his “Inferno” inside a Penny Omnibus!
However, there is a melancholy pleasure in smiling over the annoy-
ances that other people stoically endure, after one has had the courage
to say, “I’ll endure them no longer myself.” It is wrong to smile;
but one cannot help it. -
These annoyances waylay you at the threshold of the omnibus;
follow you through that
inextricable Leg Alley
through which you have
to squeeze your way,
when directed to “The
End Seat, Sir!” and
dodge you at every step
till you have taken that
seat. We have come
to the disagreeable con-
clusion-drawn from

ful experience—that iſ lº
there is an “abode of -
selfishness” in this
world, it is the interior
of an English omnibus.
Not a person makes
way for you. “Find
#. seat as you can.
on't expect me to
make room to accom-
modate you. You may
stand up for half-an-
hour for what I care. You may be rolling about from side to side,
worse than any Government steamer; but don't fancy I’m fº to
assist you. Be as uncomfortable as you please, as long as I have my
seat and am, comfortable; it’s no business of mine, and I won't stir
an inch to oblige any man.” Such seems to be the determined selfish
policy of every man who sits inside an omnibus. Perhaps a little
more courtesy may be shown to a lady; but it is so very little, a
foreigner would scarcely notice it!
Now the action of putting the hand into the pocket is generally an
interesting operation for the English mind. Assistance is mostly given
to a man who shows, a desire to perform that operation, so that, he
may perform it with the greatest ease to himself. But in an omnibus
this delicate law of Anglican nature is reversed. The operator is wed
in so tight, that it is with difficulty he can move his arm to get
urse out. The fact is, every one knows that it is not to benefit
imself, and they would see you and your purse at the bottom of the

the Conduc-
tor. He sees
persons, pay-
ing such little
attention to
each other's
comforts, that
he learns in
time to pay no
attention to
them himself.
This must be the case, for we cannot otherwise account for the inces-
sant warfare that is going on (during the 16 hours many of the poor
fellows are compelled to work) between the conductor and his passengers.
The truth is, the selfish-
ness inside gradually acts
upon him, and he grows,
at last, as selfish, perhaps
more so than any one else.
He notices that the uni-
versal law in omnibuses
is, “Every one for him-
self;” and accordingly he
applies that law to his
own benefit. In the wild
pursuit of it, it little mat-
ters to him what he does. §s
He throws in children up- º
on the mere speculation tº
that “some Gent will º
p'raps have the kindness
to take them on his knee;”
he takes up any number of
women, blissfully uncon-
scious whether the Omni-
bus will contain them or not; he will not “Stop” a minute before it
*|| pleases him, though a dozen persons may be tugging at him all the
while with a dozen hook sticks; and he will think nothing of “putting
you down” in the middle of the road, if you have been at all free in
telling him “what you think of his behaviour.”
We are sure this is the reason why Conductors are so little consi-
derate to the wishes of their passengers. And thus Selfishness is its
own punishment! and, in the words of the celebrated verdict, we say

CHAPTER I.- INTRODUCTORY.
From OLD BRompton to his Daughter.
“My DEAREST CHILD,
“I can refuse you nothing—nothing, at least, in reason; and
Violet BROMPTon is not the girl to ask what her father should not
grant. . For, whatever resemblance a too partial world may have dis-
covered between myself and PHOEBUs Apollo, I have neither a mail
phaeton in my coach-house, nor a female Phaeton in my drawing-room.
And, if my W19LET, following in her father's incendiary, footsteps,
should succeed in setting the world on fire, I am sure it will be done
Cnly in the spirit in which, a very few years ago, she used to set fire to
her snapdragons, that her friends might be able to see and snatch the
richest and best of the plums in the blaze.
“You wish to publish. Aged twenty, next May; you have seen so
much that you must tell 5; ou would be my little Special
Correspondent from the Offer-producing Districts. You want me to
emulate the magician whom 1 and MR. LANE saw at Cairo. I am to
let an innocent child take ink into its hand, and then make revelations
of sights it has seen. Be it so; but be sure that your ink is of the
right sort, or your revelations will be apocryphal, Mind, I will have
no blue ink, to º a story like * * *, full of Latin and Greek
quotations (for the most part, however, redeemed into womanliness by
mis-spelling); nor red ink, for a dashing narrative of the loves of HER
MAJEsty's army, like,” . * *; no, nor Cabinet ink, for a tale of a
lover in Opposition, and a heart broken by the division-bell, like *, *, *.
Nor, Violet, Daughter of the Magician, must the ink you take into
your white hand be a mere contemptible writing fluid;' a pitiful
negation authorship should repudiate. Ink is no mere ‘writing
fluid,” but has properties and virtues of its own, and has even a better
pedigree to show than the holy oil with which the Church of Rome is
É. oil her pet child, Louis, the Well-beloved—oil miraculously
rought direct from Heaven for the kings of France, and left till called
for at the oilman's in the Rue St. Honoré, No. 37 bus. Ink has a
better *jº than that. See that yours, my child, be thoroughbred.
Enough of iron to keep your down-strokes steady as SIR PAxton's
columns, enough of gum-arabic to serve as bird-lime for winged
thoughts (some people's fly away very unkindly, when they ought to
settle on the paper), and only just enough of galls—which are but the
results of morbid action-vegetable pearls, you know—to ornament
...}. in the fashion of the day. For, in the matter of fashion, I
would not have you a literary Bloomer; I should be loath to expose you
to the overpowering Epilogues of the Westminster boys, whose education
(as described by LoRD WILLIAM LeNNox) gives them a readiness of
satire which no lady nearer them than is Billingsgate, could meet with
equal weapons... I shall not quarrel with your literary millinery, my
love, any more than I have ever quarrelled with certain bills, at which,
while I tested their arithmetic, MADAME St. MoELLINE sitting by,
smiling unconcernedly, but ready as a cat for defence, you would look
up, half afraid papa might think those last four or five dresses a little
too extravagant.
“You shall publish. But not, I think, my beloved child, precisely as
you propose. You tell me, in your note, that you want your book?
to be prettily bound, with golden flowers crawling over the back; and
if the edge of the “book’ cannot be gilt, you will graciously compro-
mise for a gilding on the top edges only. And in your P.S. you say,
you must dedicate your “book’ to him who— but I will keep your
secret. But a book!
“No, my dear. A maiden speech should not be long. Even when
it is on the Address, and the speaker is blazing in a yeomanry uniform
(the more decorously to review a Minister's awkward squad), a great
nation is not much softened by the exertions of the military tailor, and
is ungrateful to the ‘echo,' if its repetitions are too numerous. An
aria d'intrata should not last through a whole evening. And so with a
young lady's first attempt at authorship. You shall gain, by degrees,
upon the public, my affectionate child. You know the Picar of Wakefield
by heart? Well, it was Miss OliviA PRIMRose that burst upon people
and astonished them, while Miss Sophia won upon them and charmed
them. You remember the result. MRs. Thornhill was leſt a sort of
widow bewitched—while Mrs. GeoRGE PRIMRose, and her gallant
young officer— But you are already convinced, Wiolet; and OLIVER
GoLDSMITH has wrought another of his charming conversions. I
wonder out of which of the novelis's of the present day, future papas
will be able to convert their daughters to wisdom! I suppose they
will be driven to translate GEORGE SAND.
“So, WIolet, it shall be thus. I will do for you what I would not
do for a great many titled ladies I could name; and would name, but for
making a hundred ancestral halls unhappy, by contradicting the asser.
tions of their lovely owners—that they “write for Punch.” Do you
start at the name, as at the sound of a silver trumpet P The remark.
able, the extraordinary man—pooh! The preternatural creature, or
shall Isa being, who owns that name, also owns your father as his
intimate friend. I have not, hitherto, boasted of this, for there is pride
enough in this world; but the secret is now yours. Yes, my friend
Punch shall be your literary sponsor—he will not refuse the office.
Send him, each week, a chapter of your long and eventful life, and,
who knows, by your twentieth birthday you may have made a “book,'
gold creepers and all. Speak freely; the world is your godfather's
friend, and will, I am sure, be happy to make your acquaintance. It
will be your own fault if that acquaintance be not kept up.
“Bless you, my child ! Observe in these words another proof of
my confidence in you, for you have my fatherly benediction before your
confession begins.

they bothered me to be the odd man to a dinner at Blackwall. It was
a case just like all others; deuced stupid before champagne, and just
the same after it, only noisier. Drank a great lot of everything, with
the usual philanthropic intention, namely, to see if it would make me
like my neighbour beſter. It wouldn’t. Got to town some way. Felt
thirsty, so Wobby and I had some iced punch—a good deal, I believe,

of the spectacle, but theatrical folks are proverbially ungrateful.
Where we went next, I don’t know, there were police to be treated,
and I think I had some beer. We went to a glove-fight somewhere,
and Wobby being awfully cut, would spar, and was knocked under
some grate, and may be there now for anything I know... I had a very

too, tossing some fellows, Irishmen, for whiskey-and-water, and their

I was very much affected with their recitals of the º this

We seldom look further than the outside, for we know pretty well
beforehand what will be the contents of the offensive missive we
know perfectly well that the document relates to some “Vast sale of
Grand Consignments of gorgeous and rare, &c, &c., removed from the
Crystal Palace;” or of “Merchandise entered for duty,” and
tº REMOVED in Bond from the LONDON DOCKS for IMMEDIATE CLEAR-
ANCE, in consequence of the late Coup d'Etat in France, and Alarming Commercial
Panic 111"
We know that the whole must “without reserve,” and we are
fully aware that the truth is so far told, for the parties are total strangers
to anything in the shape of “reserve,” being remarkable for their un-
blushing impudence. - - -
We are perfectly aware that, if we visit the spot, we shall find aparcel
of sinisterlooking fellows, with very large false, rings on their fingers,
walking about the place, endeavouring, by the aid of puffing and bullying
combined, to induce timid and weak-minded female visitors to purchase
worthless trash at the highest prices. We know, that if we asked to see
one of the “25,000 Splendid Robes (various) at 2s. 11d. a-yard,” we shall
be told that the whole 25,000 were sold yesterday, to either “Waterloo
House,” “Swan AND EpgAR,” or some other º: firm, in
order that some of the unhappy female fools, who will go to be taken
in by these advertising impostors, may exclaim inwardly, “Dear me!
how cheap the things must be here, when they are purchased to sell
again by the regular shopkeepers!'. We know thoroughly well, that if
we visit one of these dens of deception, we shall see some poor
infortunate being half coaxed half coerced into the purchase of some
rubbish, at double the price for which it might be had in any decent
shop; and we know also, that if a lady, has the sense and the spirit to
resist an attempt at imposture, she will be insulted by one or more of
the individuals with false rings on their fingers. - -
Feeling and knowing all this, we cannot help exclaiming to ourselves,
“What fools some people are!” when we find that it is still worth the
while of these swindling concerns to take premises, and send forth their
fraudulent announcements in the heart of the metropolis. We had
hoped the whole system had been so thoroughly exposed, that no one
could be taken in at this time of day, except an occasional dupe at a
cockney watering-place; but as we find the umbug still answers, we
can only think to ourselves “What fools some people are l’ and do our
best to render them wiser by a little wholesome exposure, now and
then, of the tricks by which they are victimised.
Who HAs THE Best of it.—The only difference between the French
Chamber and our House of Commons is this: In the one, Ministers
will not allow the Members to say anything; and in the other, Members
cannot get the Ministers to say anything.

renders the Cabinet Pudding a more alarming failure, is the fact that

Street. The St
SHOCKING EFFECT OF LOAVES AND FISHES.
PROFEssor TAYLOR, in his admirable book On Poisons, has given
very many examples of the extraordinary effect of bread, made of
certain flour, and of fish in a certain condition, upon the human frame.
The results have been strange and disastrous; but, to our mind,
nothing so curious and fatal as those we are about to narrate.
There is a loaf, much sought after, made of flour ground and
§: bolted from golden grain, and eaten by a certain few in Downing
reet.
There is, moreover, a most luxurious fish eaten in the same locality
—a fish of the most delicious taste, and costly as the lampreys of
Lucullus. The bread and the fish are much sought after by two
privileged classes; who, indeed, from their very cradles, are taught to
consider such bread and such fish, as victual sacred to themselves;
the peculiar “good” provided by the gods for the two parties, born
with palates especially refined and touched to appreciate and enjoy
them. Nevertheless, delicious and desirable as are these loaves and
fishes, they are apt to work the most extraordinary effects even upon
the privileged eaters; if it so happen that they partake of them after
long hungering for them.
PROFEssoRTAYLOR talks of a whole Canton of people being smitten
with baldness, and other, physical evils, from having eaten of bread
made of diseased wheat; he also chronicles victims to the tunny-fish.
Henceforth, let them be forgotten in the more modern results of a
sudden meal upon the loaves and fishes of Downing Street. As the
matter has really become town-talk, we violate no privacy by repeatin
it; on the contrary, we merely fulfil our humble duties of hebdomada
historian, commentator, moralist, satirist, and philosopher in general.
Well, then, here is the root of the matter.
A noble Earl of unimpeachable ſame; the very mirror of chivalry;
the rose and expectancy of the landed interest; the Cicero of the House
of Lords, and what is more, the Demosthenes of the Morning Herald,—
this noble Earl, whose name begins with a D, and ends, yes—for why
should we conceal it?—and ends with a Y; this noble Earl has, within
the last few º: given cause for the greatest anxiety on the part of
his friends (an their name is landed legion), by manifesting, on certain
occasions, the most extraordinary confusion of ideas. Several private
and confidential consultations have taken place; and it is the conviction
of the most experienced physicians and Fº that the mental
alteration, unfortunately developed in the noble Earl, has been caused
by a sudden change of diet. The Loaves and Fishes have done it!
Vulgar mussels, impregnated with low ship-copper, will prostrate even
a ... Wonderful is the impartiality of nature! An Earl
cannot, with impunity, suddenly fall upon the fish, the delicate fish,
the fish that surely has the regal purple, whereas other fish are white-
blooded; the fish that feeds upon, and transmutes into itself, the
Treasury gold;—even a chivalrous. Earl cannot fall to with hearty
good will upon such a fish, without º: his memory, and entertain-
ing—if we may use so light a word—such a confusion of ideas, that he
positively does not know an English, summer from an English autumn;
contending that when he implied May or June, he, of course, meant
October or November. May brings hawthorns, and October barley;
and they are both alike 1 June unfolds the rose, and November pulls
down the fog; and garden flowers and London smoke, are they not
synonymous? When a mind—once so logical—is brought into such a
state by Treasury bread, eaten, too new, and fishes, it may be, as the
eaters thought, over-kept, it does teach us a lesson of humility; it
does preach to us a reverence for a common nature, whether manifested
in a fantailed coalheaver, or an Earl of stars and garters.
“Oysters and perriwinkles”—says PROFEsson TAYLOR – “have
occasionally given rise to similar symptoms,” i.e., of irritation. About
a fortnight, since, MR. DI-LI did certainly show “symptoms of
irritation;" but this was after an early, and almost his first, dinner of
the fish of Downing Street. The Right Hon. Gentleman ordinarily
speaks nothing poorer of the oyster, than its pearls; but on the
occasion of his answering LoRD J-N R-s–LL, it was remarked that
the speech of the ChancELLoR of THE Exchequer had less of the
purity of the pearl than the edginess of the shell.
Others of º Government have, more or less, displayed symptoms of
the effects of their new loaf and fish diet. “Giddiness, unconscious-
ness”—says Professor Taylor-has attacked certain fish-eaters
under certain circumstances. Now, we put it to ADMIRAL SIR CHARLEs
NAPIER—(always a cool, impartialjudge)—whether ApºſtRALBERKEley
—having eaten of the fish of Downing Street—did not display both
iddiness and unconsciousness, when he talked of being able—at a few
ours' notice—to girdle England with a protective fleet of steamers?
Before going to press, we made a dutiful and no less anxious inquiry
at Downing Street, and found that the new loaf and fish eaters were
quite as well as could be expected. Indeed—but this we must premise
is their own statement-their new diet seemed to agree better and
better with them: though detraction would whisper, that one or two up-
starts, after having eaten of the fish of office, did walk stiffly, as though
they had bolted the bones,

AMUSEMENTS OF PASSION WEEK.
THE present week is a week of inconsistencies. All the theatres are
supposed to be shut, and yet all the theatres are actually open. Any-
body who can do anything, and some who can do nothing, feel them-
selves at liberty to attempt to amuse an audience in Passion Week;
At one establishment we are invited to witness a grand combination of
“Francisco Wonders, Feast of Lanthorns, Flying Air Divers,” and
other startling attractions; while, at another theatre, we are promised
a “Solo on the Concertina,” as the grand point of the evening's
amusement. The fact is, that the suspension for a week of dramatic
amusement leaves a gap, which it is found desirable to fill up ; and, as
legitimate materials are prohibited, any stuff is thought sufficient to
open a theatre with. . Any individual who can imitate a saw, and give
a faint idea of the frying of a pancake, or who can exclaim, “Bill, are
ou up there P” and can answer himself by saying, “No, I’m down
ere,” to convey the notion of some one speaking in a cellar below-any
person who can do, this, or hold an imaginary conversation with an
imaginary individual up an imaginary chimney, becomes at once a
§ºmething or other, and announces an entertainment for Passion
ee
All those ingenious individuals who spread carpets in the public
thoroughfares, and go through a series of tantalising preparations for
a performance which never seems to come off, but º: after a pre-
liminary subscription from the bystanders, terminates provokingly
before it begins—all the itinerant gentlemen with paletots over fancy
costumes, and tin-ſoiled bands round their long-haired heads, become
elevated during Passion Week into Unrivalled Acrobats, Ö mpian
Competitors, or Brothers of some far-distant locality. They find them-
selves transferred suddenly from the stones to the tº. or from the
gravel to the sawdust, and instead of a street circle of ragged lookers-
on, they find themselves in the midst of a crowded theatrical audience.
In order that these irregular occupants of the various temples of the
drama may get an extra feed, the members of the regular theatrical
fraternity are curtailed of their fair proportion of dinner and salary-
at least such of them as live from hand to mouth; while all are sub-
jected to a sensible—or rather a senseless-reduction of income. . If
religious scruples require that there should be no acting in Passion
Week, the same objections would certainly apply to the making of
fictitious pancakes in false frying-pans; the holding of false dialogue:
with º: who have no existence; and the mendacious assumption of
foreign titles by British tumblers, who twist themselves into all sorts of
shapes, assume the mendacious character of Italian, French, or Bedouin
Brotherhoods.
THE PROTECTIONIST CUCKOO.
The Protectionist Cuckoo is already one of the rarest of birds, and
the whole family will soon fade from the eye of the Political Naturalist.
They are remarkable, chiefly, for the uselessness of their bills, which are
crooked, and do not point straightforwardly to any particular, object,
but aim at reaching it in an indirect or roundabout manner. The flight
of the Protectionist Cuckoo is so feeble, that it makes very little
progress, and indeed is incapable of any high flight whatever. Its
movements are effected by short and sudden hops; and, like the :
cuckoo, it makes its prey of the softest and feeblest among animat
creatures that it comes in contact with.
The Protectionist, like the ordinary Cuckoo, has a strong ..
take up its abode in a snug nest that has been .# feathered by
some prior occupant. An instance has lately occurred at a nest in
Downing Street, which has been for some time occupied by a family of
a different tribe, the head of which had in a pet hopped the twig,
intending soon to return to his nest; but on coming back he found a
Protectionist Cuckoo and party settled comfortably down in it.

A PETITION (AS IT OUGHT TO BE).
The Humble Petition of the Metropolitan Water Companies
to the Commons House of Parliament, Sheweth,
*** ** , HAT your Petitioners, in order
.* | | || || || 1– |- to secure a monopoly of the
|||}|\, ºt. I'llº!— * Water Supply of the Metro.
*------
polis, have spent large sums of
money in Parliamentary con-
tests, which sums they have not
yet had an opportunity of fully
repaying themselves out of the
pockets of the consumers.
That your Petitioners have
supplied. Water of a very supe-
rior quality; viz., Thames water,
of a much more nutritious cha-
racter than any soft water, sup-
plied in its natural state, pos-
sibly can be ; the said Thames
water being enriched with the
sewage of the Metropolis, which
is known to contain a large per-
centage of animal matter, not
to mention the animalcules,
shrimps, and small fish, which
are supplied with it.
That your Petitioners are as-
sociated on the great principle
of Self-government, or Govern-
ment for Self and partners;
which principle is incompatible
with any supervision whatever.
That your Petitioners are as-
sured that soft water supplies,
from gathering grounds, would
ſail in drought; and that, if
Thames water be hard, it would be harder if there were none.
That your Petitioners ought not to be compelled to have recourse to
a high-pressure supply, inasmuch as such a supply contravenes the
great natural law that water finds its own level.
That your Petitioners object to give a constant supply, as such a
supply would do away with the use of cisterns—the making, cleansing,
and repairing whereof now create employment for a large body of
industrious artisans, who would have to find other work were a
constant supply enforced.
That your Petitioners object to any central superintendence, as your
Petitioners know their own interest best; and that such interest is
often as high as 20 per cent, which would be much reduced on any
scale of rates likely to be sanctioned by a central supervising authority.
That your Petitioners believe that no, gathering grounds can be
so safely relied on as the gathering ground hitherto resorted to by your
Petitioners: viz., the pockets of the consumers.
That your Petitioners believe a constant supply of water at high
pressure to the street mains, would supersede that admirable depart-
ment the Fire Brigade, and throw MR. BRAIDwoop out of employment,
besides impairing the income of the various Fire Insurance Companies.
That your Petitioners further believe that if water were supplied at
a low price to the poor, the receipts of those excellent institutions, the
Baths and Wash-houses, would be seriously diminished.
For all which reasons your Petitioners pray to be heard by counsel
against any bill for improving the Metropolitan Water Supply.
And your Petitioners will ever pray, &c.
An Affair of Honour.
It has been announced that a sum equal to about £400,000 out of the
roceeds of the timber from the confiscated estates of the ORLEANs
amily is to be invested in Rentes as a subsidy for the Legion of
Honour. -

the theft; and, if the legion of Honour consents to share in the
º: plunder, it will verify the proverb of “Honour among

“MORE HONOURED IN THE BREACH THAN IN THE
OBSERVANCE.”
THE other day, there was a trial for breach of º: of marriage.
The defendant was a young butcher. The young butcher's love-letters
were read. One love-letter concluded, after a high flight of passion,
with—“Good-bye, dear, for the present—I’m going to kill!”
Punch read the report, and indulged in a philosophical chuckle; for,
alas! that butcher-boy was but too striking an example of the way in
which sentiment merges into trade. In a higher rank, a youth might
break off his love-letter to go and make money, or to go to TATTERsALL’s,
and yet not be a truer lover than that homely butcher-boy, who went
º tººdminister to a calf such a wound as Cupid had inflicted on
imself.
But suddenly a thought struck Punch. We have heard nothing of
the approaching marriage of B—E lately. Some
months ago, was not that young genius to be married? Is it the fact,
then, that his passion broke off abruptly, for reasons precisely the same
as those of the butcher-boy? Perfidious, butcher-boy! Thou wert,
then, a plagiarist! Thou stolest thy idea from the P-E! Yes, the
P—E broke short off in his courtship—he was “going to kill !”

THE CRYSTAL PALACE REPORT.
T is a common trick to write

ink-lines of a letter that
which may escape the eyes
of those unaware of the
secret acid. Hold the sheet
to the fire, when slowly dawn
upon the paper the hidden
marks, and the true corres-
pondence stands revealed.
Punch knew that tricks had
been º: with the above-
named report; and although
SIR. Joseph Paxton had ex-
posed the juggle as played
upon himself—nevertheless,
thought Punch, there is
more to come out. On this
he held the Report, to the
fire of his glance, and out came the subjoined evidence—although
officially suppressed—written in lemon-juice.
LoRD STONEHENGE Eramined—Thinks the Crystal Palace a bore--a
very great bore. It’s done what it had to do, and there’s an end of it.
When you’ve grown your cucumbers, i." don't want a cucumber-frame
all the year long? Besides, lives in the neighbourhood, and therefore
the Glass Thing would be a nuisance—an insufferable nuisance.
The DowAGER, LADY PoMPADour.—Had no idea when she came
to live in the neighbourhood that there would be such an invasion on
the rights of nobility. There was a talk, about amusing the mob.
Hadn't they got children—she was sure she had seen poor children-
certainly children ; and couldn’t they stop at home and be amused with
them? The low people that were brought last year past her door
almost sent typhus fever into her best bedroom. If the lower classes
wanted a Glass Palace, as it was profanely named—(what next, when
in her time what was called the swinish multitude was now called the
eople)—let them go to France, where she heard they were going to
º one. She . ed to state this as an alternative: either the
Crystal Palace shou f move, or she would. -
The Hon. CAPTAIN MARTINGALE, of The RAINBows.-The thing
was a dem’d humbug—he would say, altogether humbug" There was
no place for horse exercise if the Park was desecrated—yes, that was
the word-desecrated by dem'd glazier's work. If you'd no horse
exercise, how would you get your cavalry . If you'd no cavalry, how
would you repel an invasion? Would Nobden and Bight—what were
the º names?—Would they do it upon a pair of piebalds? If
you'd no cavalry—which was the brightest gem in HER MAJESTY's
crown—diadem he should say—and begged HER MAJESTY's pardon-
yes, if you’d no cavalry, England was gone—insolent foreigner-homes
and altars—tricolor over the Marble. Arch-and all through a dem'd
dropsical overblown melon-frame, that, he didn't believe, would grow
a melon after all. - - -
SIR ADAM ARARAT, BART.-He was not prejudiced; at his time of
life, no man was. But he would say this, and say it in the calmest,
most dispassionate manner—for as he said he was above prejudice—he
would say that until last year the people—that is, the mob, for he met

THE BITTER BEER CONTROWERSY.
A controversy, involving much bitterness, has lately been raging in the news-
papers on that flattest of all subjects, Beer; and it is a remarkable fact that some
of the parties to the quarrel have, evidently, not thought “small beer” of
themselves, or their commodities. Somebody happened to declare that strychnine
was used in the manufacture of bitter ale, when nearly every brewer of that article
"rushed into print,” for the purpose of * his own peculiar beverage. One
firm proposed that a commission should he immediately appointed to inquire
whether there was really nothing but mischief brewing on the premises; and another
firm offered to open its vats to the gaze of curiosity, and bring all its bungs into
the eye of the closest scrutiny. Qur old friend the British public is a little apt to
exaggerate when it takes it into its head that it is being imposed upon; and when
an article has once got a bad name, nothing is bad enough to meet the popular
notion regarding it. For instance, milk, which is actually nothing more than
mere whitewash, is popularly supposed to be a compound of sheep's brains and
other filth, by the side of which chalk is innocence itself; and nobody who buys a
pound of sugar can be induced to believe that he is not purchasing a great deal
more sand than saccharine. Porter has been described by some who have taken
an erroneous view of Portºn's Statistics, as a compound of Spanish Liquorice
and Horse-flesh, though we think it would be difficult to trace a relation between
the knacker's yard and any of our great London breweries.
Our friend, the Lancet, by its exposure of certain tricks in the coffee and other
trades, has made the public suspicious of nearly everything that is sold for food;
and the popular supposition that bread consists of nothing but alum and plaster.
of-Paris, may soon again have, its partisans. For our own parts, we are not
disposed to look at the worst side of everything, and we are inclined—perhaps too
credulously—to believe that our tea is not all birch-broom, nor our port-wine all
sloe-juice. º bad, has some redeeming quality. Mankind
is not all bad, and coffee is not all chicory. There is but one thing in the world to
which we would refuse credit for some extenuating circumstance—and that article is
the cheap Sausage.
“MODIFICATION.”
A New Song to an Old Tune.
Good people, don't heed the objection,
That we aim at restoring Protection;
It's quite a mistake
hat we e'er meant to make
Such a gift to our rural connection.
"Tis true, that with your approbation,
Andall for the good of the nation,
Some measures we’ve plann’d
For improving the land,
And encouraging good cultivation;
But that will make no alteration,
On Free Trade not the least innovation,
"Twill merely be “Modification”—
As plainly we’ll make it appear.
The farmers are ready to storm us,
And rents, so the landlords inform us,
Are shamefully low,
While the burdens, you know,
Upon land come to something enormous
You, of course, can have no inclination,
For these interests’ extermination;
So we’re sure you will see
No objection can be
To remodelling local taxation;
And if by a slight transportation,..
Their load we can shift on the nation,
You'll approve such a “Modification,”
Though bread be a trifle more dear.
For the land, as you know, the sole fount is
To which all the liberal bounties
Of the poor rate are due,
And the highway rate too, -
Not to speak of the rate called “the counties'.”
Now if, as an alleviation -- - -
Of the Landlord's depressed situation,
We could law on town backs
Some three-fourths of this tax,
'Twere absurd to call that spoliation-
To people of fashion and station, -
You’d ne'er grudge the poor consolation,
Of a trumpery “Modification”—
To the tune of eight millions a year.
From that very large interest—the Shipping-
Protection you've lately been stripping,
And never again
Will those much-injured men, .
Their hands in your pockets be dipping:
Yet, though we see acceleration
In the tonnage of each foreign nation,
Spite of HERRIEs and YoUNG,
We have overboard flung
The old laws that tied up Navigation.
But if we could guide importation
By rules of strict reciprocation,
That were surely a “Modification,”
'Gainst which no one could e'er interfere.
Then there's sugar, which constantly dinn’d is
In our ears, from the East and West lindies,
And on which we 'd a case,
Ere we came into place, - --
Would have made the most awful of shindies.
Yet PAkington's great moderation,
And the Planters' known self-abnegation,
Have settled e'en that ;
So, though sugars “rule flat,” .
Yet in them there’ll be no fermentation;
Yet still, upon consideration -
Of the great cause of Slave-liberation,
We may find a “Modification”
Is quite indispensable, here.
But any re-opening the question
Of Free Trade, we will all like a pest shun,
Even Christopher's self
We will put on the shelf, .
If he venture on such a suggestion-
And after much deliberation, -
We've determined on this declaration;
Protection we drop—
And the sign of our shop
Henceforth undergoes alteration.
Yes—this is our determination,
On which we will go to the Nation;
Not Protection, but “Modification,”
Which are different things—'tis quite clear.
A Large Protest.
Three Deputies (who may be looked upon as the three
last representatives of Egalité, Liberté, and Fraternité)
refused to take the oath of allegiance to Louis NAPO-
Leon's new Government. We are astonished ourselves
at the largeness of this number: for ever since Louis
NAppleon has been at the head of French affairs, we
should have thought his conduct had been such as to
have made every Frenchman swear.

MORAL MADNESS.
SLL Chancellors of the Ex-
chequer are alike, in one re-
spect. It is the lot of each
to be the recipient of money-
letters from monomaniacs
afflicted with morbid irrita-
bility of conscience. The
patient who furnished occa-
sion for the subjoined para-
graph in the Times, must be
very bad—he is so inordi-
mately good:-
**The Chancellon of the Ex-
chequea acknowledges the receipt
of the halves of three notes for
£50, for Income-Tax supposed to
be claimable from ‘M.'"
The most scrupulous, per-
son, if sane, one would think,
would like to be quite cer-
tain that his Income-Tax,
was due before he paid it—
would, if there were a doubt
on such a question, give himself the benefit of the doubt. The acute-
ness of the moral sense of “X” can only be exceeded by the obtuse-
ness of his intellectual faculties.
A BLACK PRINCE AND HIS BROTHERS.
THE Puseyies should send out a mission to Africa. They have a
fancy for black letters; and a piece of black literature, published in
Lond PALMERston's recent blue book, may be considered, moreover,
to invite their ecclesiastical labours. The composition is that of his
sable majesty GUEzo, KING of DAhomſey; a missive addressed by the
ebony monarch to Queen Victoria. The royal negro begins with the
following salutation:
“The King of Danoxey presents his best compliments to the QUEEN or England.
The presents which she has sent him are very acceptable, and are good for his face.”
Hence it, might be surmised that our gracious Sovereign Lady,
imagining that he might perhaps wear boots, had sent him certain
bottles of DAY and MARTIN, which he had used as a cosmetic. His
face, however, is something that it would be difficult to improve.
Alluding to the Slave-trade, he says, with native cheek, perfectly
splendid without polish–
“He cannot see that he and his people can do without it.
that he derives his principal revenue . . . He begs the Queen of England to put
a stop to the Slave-trade everywhere else, and allow him to continue it.”
But this last passage suggests that any missionary charity we might
be disposed to extend to Guezo might begin at home. His petition is
simply a bold straightforward appeal for protection. GUEzo might ask
the “territorial interest,”“Am I not a man and a brother?” Does
he not stand in that fraternal relation to the gentlemen who want the
Corn-trade put down everywhere else, and themselves alone to be suf-
fered to carry it on?
GUEzo's claim to brotherhood with certain eminent persons does not
rest here. Another of his requests is this:
“The king also begs the Queen to make a law that no ships be allowed to trade at
any place near his dominions lower down the coast than Whydah, as by means of
trading vessels the people are getting rich and withstanding his authority.”
Who are the commercial “upstarts” whom some of our feudal-
minded magnates are so desirous to put down, but people who are
getting rich and withstanding their authority?
The military ardour of King Guezo is, lastly, a point wherein he
might claim kindred with many chivalrous and high-spirited individuals
among us—we beg their pardon—above us. He declares that
“He hopes the QUEEN will send him some good Tower guns and blunderbusses, and
plenty of them, to enable him to make war.”
So that before making any attempts to wash this sovereign blackamoor
white, we ought to have a rub at some of our own noblemen and squires,
who oppose Free Trade and pacific principles, precisely like GUEzo,
illustrious among the Kings of Niggerdom.
It is from the Slave-trade
A Joke's a Joke for all that.
At the Royal Italian Opera, the other evening, there was present
among the audience a Wag, whose hopeless condition may beinferred
from the fact, that when offered the use of an opera glass, he remarked
that, “to take in the full scope of all the beauties of Tell would require
nothing less than a Tel-e-scope.” The º individual has since
quitted his family and become a member of the Police Force.
CONTRASTS WITH THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
“Comparisons are odious.”—CopyBook.
So, the Palace of Crystal is doom'd to come down,
Says my Lord, the Adviser-in-Chief to the Crown;
The world that, amazed, its creation beheld,
Shall be still more astonish’d by seeing it fell’d.
Our Metropolis can’t quite be call'd over-graced
With structures and monuments famous for taste;
And in pulling things down, one perhaps might suggest,
That we better might do, than begin with the best.
Shall the Palace of Crystal fall? ere we demand,
We might ask, shall the Palace of Buckingham stand?
With its parts so misfitting, before and behind,
Like a mermaid—the female and fish ill-combined.
Is the Gallery, which pepper-dredge turrets adorn,
To continue a mark for the finger of scorn;
A dungeon for Art upon Europe's best site,
A place to keep pictures in out of the light?
Shall the Wellington Statue—upraised by a trick
Upon poor Burton’s Arch still be suffer'd to stick?
ell-peace may depend on the comical yiew
Which must make every Frenchman forgive Waterloo.
Must the º of GeoRGF, the third king of the name,
In Pall Mall, still procure him ridiculous fame?
And his son and successor—a sight to deride-
By Saint Martin's Church sit like an ostler astride?
Shall the Duke of York's image stay mounted on high
As if it were JENNER's; as near to the sky,
As though York were owed a vast debt by his race,
Instead of the contrary being the case?
Yes, these and such objects are all to remain;
They are eyesores—regarded with scorn or with pain-
To the heart of the nation endear'd not at all;
Most people, indeed, would rejoice at their fall.
Had thy fabric been rear'd in the public's despite;
Were it heavy and dull, as 'tis graceful and light;
Had thy mame been the hissing and joke of the lan
Crystal Place, thou then hadst been certain to stand.
But, being the wonder of civilised man,
For use, beauty, skill of construction, and plan,
As LoRD DERby remark'd, amid cries of “Hear, hear!”
Thou, “beautiful building,” must now “disappear!”
Cocks-A Parallel.
Soulouque is a full-bloom emperor; Louis NAPOLEoN is only an
emperor in the bud. But the Cock of Hayti, and the Cock Gallic, or
Çock of France, do, in the similarity of their fate, supply a parallel.
Birds of a feather instruct together. A letter from Hayti, dated
Feb. 8, 1850, and quoted in the Presse French newspaper, tells us how
the Emperor sacrificed to the shades of his father and mother.
Together with a sheep and a bird was sacrificed a cock!
Within a few days past, the Cock of France has been sacrificed by
the President to the shade of Napoleon; and in place of the dead
poultry, the nephew of his uncle supplies—from Boulogne abattoir—his
own eagle.
THE sover EIGN PEOPLE.
...Of all the Sovereign People there are none who so richly deserve the
title as the people in Australia and California—for there it is the fault
of every man if he doesn’t pick up sufficient gold during the day to
make him a Sovereign before the evening.
An Ingenious Mechanic.
THE Morning Post tells us, that
“A wheelwright at Huddersfield has built a grand waggon in a chamber over his
shop, and is unable to get it out.”
This clever artificer might be employed by the Commissioners of
Public Works, if they mean to carry on business in the style of their
predecessors.

French Empire is the embryo of an—“IF.”
MR. HUME's PLACE.
Joseph HUME has attained to a very, high position;
for, during a long career, he has been steadily pursuing
Reform up-hill.
BOOKED FOR PARIS.
It would be very foolish for Louis NAPOLEoN to erect a new
building in the Champs Elysées, on the plan of the Crystal Palace,
when there is one already finished, and ready to his hand, Why doesn't
he send over and buy up the original building in Hyde Park, exactly as
it stands?. The Messrs. Pickford would pack it up very safely, and
deliver,it in a large case (labelled, of course, “GLAss, witH CARE”),
at his door, at a very trifling expense for him. ...We should prefer this
disgrace to the one of its destruction—for Englishmen then, when they
heard their fathers talk with pride about the Great Exhibition, that had
attracted all the world to London in the year 1851, would have the
satisfaction of knowing that the wonderful building which had con-
tained it was still in existence, and might still be seen-only, they must
go to Paris to look at it!
Refreshing Source for Congratulation.
The astonishing genuineness of Bitter Ale, as deposed to by so
many. Bitter Ale merchants, ought to make an Englishman's heart leap
with joy, that there is, at least, one article of consumption that goes
down his throat that, is not adulterated The Spring of Health in
England must surely flow with Bitter Ale; for it seems to be infinitely
superior to water—at least the water so called, which is supplied to us
by our filthy Water Companies.
O BE SOLD.—THE BIG BELL of the President of the Chamber of
Deputies. As this Bell, which made so great a noise in the last Assembly, is now
completely muffled, it would be parted with, a great Bargain, being of no ºt, use to
its present owner. It is just the thing for a Dustman, or for a Roman Catholic Chapel,
as it has been accustomed to be rung at all hours; or else it would suit the purpose
admirably of any vulgar rich people who think it fashionable to ring a bell violently
in the open air every day merely to let their neighbours know they are going to eat
their dinner. The annoyance, in any case, would be perfect, as the noise the Bell
makes may, without any affectation, be called quite stunning. For terms, address to

A LITTLE DERBY DAY.
THAT extract from the Jockey Club, the Cabinet, was greatly
delighted at Northampton races the other day. The Whittlebury
Stakes were won by the EARL of DeRBY's Longbow, which “got the
pull” upon Dangerous and Postulant, and even defeated the Captions
mag, from the Westminster stables. It was observed, too, that
Longbow imitated his owner's tactics, and literally made it a “waiting
race,” by delaying the proceedings for an hour, for want of a shoe-we
beg . on, plate. One of the subscribers, moreover, was fined “for
not declaring his colour;” but this gentleman, curiously enough, was
not the EARL of DeRBy.
A Hint to Disraeli.
We cannot believe that BEN. DisrAELI, the literary man, will
consent to the destruction of the Crystal Palace. He, at least, will
not be guilty of such an act of Wandalism. No, we are sure he will
interest himself to the utmost for its preservation, and so earn for
himself the proud title of having given, England the first Conservative
Ministry that ever did anything for the Million.
ARGUMENT FOR THE BALLOT.
It is said that the Ballot would afford no cure for bribery; but who
would buy a vote if he could not be sure of it? . Adopt the plan of
secret voting, and though the constituency might be bought, it is
probable that the candidate would be sold.
ADVICE TO CERTAIN CORRESPONDENTS.
THE Athenaeum, in a lively paragraph directed to merciless corres-

eave to amend even this excellent counsel, and says, “Think twice, and
then don't write at all.”

If you’re waking, call me early, call me early, ALBERT, dear,
For I would see the May sun rise on the Crystal Palace clear;
It may be the last, May morning that its light roof will be seen,
For perhaps they’ll lay it low in the Park, as it had never been.
Last May I oped the mighty Show; we had a glorious day,
And everything went off, dear, in a most delightful way;
And you read the Address so well, and minded all the stops;
And there was that old Chinaman, with his pig-tail and Bath chops.
Qf course Lord SEYMoUR must be right; we ought not to complain;
But I own it seems a pity to pull it down again.
That Iron Duke of WYATT's comes to ugly'gainst the sky,
One wants some graceful object but to relieve the eye.
A Crystal Palace of its own New York’s to have, I see,
And another, too, in Paris erected is to be;
And with pride both French and Yankees will show transept, aisle, and
nave,
When in the dust of Rotten Row ours long have found a grave.
When summer comes again, love, after our breakfast light,
We shall never walk the Princes down, to see that wondrous sight;
You know before the crowd came, how still it was, and cool,
I’ve no doubt the children learnt more than if they’d been at school.
A charming Winter-garden, I'm sure it would have made,
All alive with flowers and ſountains, a world of various shade;
With statues peeping from the leaves, and perfumed airs that pass,
Bringing the sweet South home to us beneath that heaven of glass.

THE EMPEROR OF FEANCE–ALMOST.
Not very long ago, and it took three years to grow a pine-
apple: the fruit may now be produced in perfection in about
six months. This is a great step; nevertheless, our age
grows Emperors—(thanks to the peculiar dunghill!)-in a
much shorter time.
“History.”—writes the Times, upon the barlequin-like
change of Louis NApoleon—“History has scarcely re-
corded a more strange incident than that a man who for
four years could hardly get a bill cashed in the city of
London, save on usurious interest, should now be worth
£500,000 a-year,” and lord of the palaces of France. Very
good; but time is often the most ravenous-the most
exacting of usurers; and who shall say what per-centage
the President may yet be called upon to pay for the some
time use of the principal?
Nevertheless, write the President's apologists and ad-
mirers, all is calm in France. In our Old Bailey Court, last
week, two burglars, by name, JAMEs MURPHY and JAMEs
WILLIAMs, were tried. A police constable gave evidence
that he stopped the prisoners with a bundle, saying, “What,
you've been hard at it, mate *"
Whereupon, burglar Murphy replied—“It is all serene.”
“Translate the meaning of that,” said the counsel.
“It means,” said the policeman, “quite calm, beautiful.”
The great Parisian burglary of the second of December
was, in its result, according to some folks, “all serene;”
for at this moment trade flourishes, and Paris is “quite
calm, beautiful.”
Poor Murphy is not lº to benefit by what he
deems the “serenity” of his burglary—he is found guilty;
but then the burglary of a whole nation is another matter;
and justice has to bide her time for the sittings of that
Old Bailey that passes sentence upon usurpers.
There is to be a statue—long talked of—of “My Uncle”
NApoleon, on the triumphal arch at the Barrière de l'Etoile.
It will represent the Emperor—not the Emperor in the shell
but the full-grown and plucked Emperor of 1815-in ful
coronation robes, with the sceptre in one hand, and the
globe, surmounted by a cross, in the other. The figure is
to be seated upon an eagle rising out of a thunder-cloud.
Let this statue have a companion by all means; the Em-
peror that is to be, holding a bottle of champagne (in com-
memoration of the Boulogne invasion) in one hand, and a
Strasburg sausage in the other. He may, moreover, be seated
º a colossal magpie (the bird of vulgar plunder), rising out
of a cloudof civil smoke, the smoke of the secondof December.
“THE Stomach AND its DIFFigulties.”—The greatest
difficulty, with many people, is filling it.
LoRD SEYMoUR's wild and wayward, but he's out of office now,
And Lord John MANNERs is so kind and courteous, all allow;
That though I can’t speak a word, dear, a hint you might convey,
How very sorry I should be to see it swept away.
You might point out to DisBAELI that it would be a bore
To waste in pulling down a hundred thousand pounds and more,
And that when Fox AND HENDERSON and PAxton all declare
That for five thousand pounds a-year they’ll keep it in repair.
Good night, dear ALBERT; call me before the day is born,
I jº. to see the sun rise on the Palace this May morn.
But after all, I hope and trust it's not to disappear; .
They'll surely never pull it down—Do you think they will, my dear *

“HE PLACED Cox FIDENCE IN thr phrsrnt Gover NMENT, AND THEREFour HE should

At length, then, we have a Ministry with which the Colonel is
satisfied. Will the country be satisfied with it too? In that case,
our country and our Colonel will be of the same mind.

“EAU-SUCREE *—THE HELICON OF FRENCH
ELOQUENCE.
S all speechifying is to be
prohibited in the Chamber
of Deputies, there will be
an end to the eau-sucrée
that used to be handed
to the orators to quench
their thirst for eloquence.
We believe this custom of
drinking sugar-water at
the Tribune was originally
instituted to encourage
theconsumption of French
sugar; but if the custom
is to cease, it is terrible
to think what will become
of the two or three pro-
prietors who have thrown
every beetroot they had
into that exceedingly
= small field of commerce.
It is clear a blight will
5 fall upon it worse than
i any that ever fell upon
a potato-field. The poor
Betteraves will be com-
pletely ruined, literally
pulled up by the roots
and for the future will
have to mix only with
salads, instead of the
great men—the WERONs,
the PATUROTs, and PATE-
R£GNAULTs — of the
French Assembly. We
see , but one. hope, of
staving off this certain
- - ruin. Let the same quan-
tity of º which was formerly consumed, be melted down into barley-
sugar-sticks, and one of these bitons of sucre d'orge be presented to every
Député. It will reconcile him to the loss of his dear eau-sucrée, and
moreover will depriye him of any desire of opening his mouth as long as
hº can employ his lips so much more agreeably by keeping them closed.
The sight of such a Parliament, too, would be as good as gold to Louis
NAPoleon's heart, for he would then be able to see realised a Stick in
every Member.
The Stingo Cure.
It is probable that the Cold Water Cure will be quite superseded.
advertisement has appeared, calling the attention of invalids to the
“Rev. J. LANE, Saltash Parsonage, Plymouth, and many others, lately cured with
the delicious and reasonable ALE brewed with water from ‘HARRY HILL's Well.'"
What will the Teetotallers say to a Clergyman cured by drinking
beer? We are not informed of what malady it was that the reverend
gentleman was cured with the delicious and reasonable ale, but we
£uppose it was dropsy, as a necessary condition to his relief must have
been tapping.
“SMALL chANGE.”

are bent on conferring their confidence on Mr. BUTT. This seems
capricious. What need of changing the representative, if they only
wanted a Butt P
Common Sense on Wheels.
MANY of our cheap Omnibuses, we see, still keep the exploded label
“EXHIBITION,” on their not very newly painted panels. Now, it
would be far more appropriate, we think, if they were to retain the first
syllable only of “that once familiar word; ” for everybody but a 'bus-

ODE TO THE REW. ROBERT WHISTON,

Of a good Dean and Chapter such painful exposures,
That they’ve everywhere roused very great indignation
Against those holy gentry for gross malversation."
Such grounds 'tis no wonder that you were dismissed on,
Wicked Bob WHISTON.
And so it appears that you can't be contented
With the sack by those preachers of meekness presented,
And in open Court seek to make good your assertions:
You had º: admit them unfounded aspersions
Than their truth in that obstinate manner insist on,
Wicked Bob WHISTON.
Don't you know—though the maxim is not in the Bible-
That the greater the truth is, the greater the libel?
Had you falsely accused them of positive stealing,
The offence had been less than abuses revealing
By charges, a basis of fact that exist on,
Wicked Bob WHISTON |
In accordance, of course, with their sacred profession,
They might have forgiven the little transgression
Qf slander; you humbly . . . . pardon;
A sinner repenting they could not be hard on;
As it is, they’d deprive you of means to subsist on,
Wicked Bob WHISTON.
You expect to be trusted with children's tuition!
You, a fellow who'd train them direct to perdition!
You, a vile anti-shovel hat pamphlet inditer! -
Don’t you know what you're called by a reverend writer?
On account of your book he cries out, Atheist on,
Wicked Bob WHISTON.
TWO ANSWERS WANTED.
LoRD John Russell wishes us to believe the following extraordi-
nary assertion:
“No doubt Load Tobrington was a distant relation of his (Lond John Russell's);
but Lond Tonnington did not owe to that relationship his appoi t to the G
norship of Ceylon.”
Now, we should like to receive answers to the two following
questions:-
“Whether, supposing Lord TorKINGTON had not been a relation of
LoRD John’s, he would have received the appointment at all?
“And if so, what were his extraordinary recommendations for the
office? for we are afraid that, beyond the accident of his Whig relation-
ship, º was not possessed of a single one, as the result too painfully
proved?”
It would have been better for Lord John Russell to have confessed
manfully—“Yes, LoRD TonkingtoN was my relation, and, as I looked
upon that recommendation as the highest possible qualification for
office, I appointed him accordingly; and you, gentlemen, who now
taunt me with this act, would have done precisely the same if you had
had the same opportunity.”
If Lord JoãN had spoken as above, we should have been happy to
have agreed with him, and even to have cried “Bravo!” but when a
Whig Minister tells us that he did not appoint a most incapable man to
a certain office, simply because that incapable man happened to be his
relation, we must say, knowing what we do of Whig Ministers, that it
i. M. so much that we cannot possibly bring ourselves to
elieve 1
Our Monuments.
A CorresponDENT in the Times very properly advocates the º;
ment of a Minister to take charge of all tombs and monuments of kings
and chiefs. Why not? And how easy would it be to turn a Minister
of Woods and Forests into a Minister of Stocks and Stones! Indeed,
LoRD SEYMoUR could double both posts: being both green in
experience, and petrifying in manner.
Our Maniac's Last.
(Fresh from Bedlam.)
Why should a man, when he's eating, salt fish on a Good Friday,
take no egg-sauce with it?—For fear his appetite should get egg-
sauce-ted (exhausted).

healthful or otherwise—of the bitterness of our bitter beer; that
authority is—GENERAL HAYNAU.

FLOWERS ALL ROUND MY HAT.
FINE Cargo of French Artificial
Flowers has been consigned to
Mr. Punch, of 85, Fleet Street.
Below is a specimen of the
same. The manufacturer is
his Eminence the CARDINAL
ARchbishop of Borde AUx:
ou know that Cardinal Arch-
ishops are rare hands at
making artificial flowers—of
speech. These may be de-
scribed as ornaments to a cer-
tain pat of rhetorical butter,
spread very thick upon Louis
NAPOLEON the other day by
his above-named Eminence, on
the occasion of having his new
Hat put on his head by the
PRINCE PRESIDENT, and in
acknowledgment of that com-
plimentary act of menial ser-
vice. The “name’’ which the
Cardinal represents as having
undergone such wonderful
metamorphoses is, of course, that of Bon ARARTE the Elder. Here is
your pretty posy of papistical flunkeyism and soft sawder:-
“France is not ungrateful; 50 years later, that name, hailed as a recollection and a
hope, was borne from the cities to the plains on two occasions, and was transformed into
two immense facts by the most spontaneous and irresistible outburst of which the
history of any people makes mention.”
Fancy a name which was at the same time a recollection and a hope,
being borne from an indefinite number of cities to as many plains, not
only once, but on two occasions, and then transformed by a spontaneous
and irresistible outburst into two immense facts. Fancy this process;
for, who ever saw the like anywhere but at Vauxhall, or in the fairy
scene at the end of an Easter burlesque? If we could venture on the
flowery style, we should rather describe the “name alluded to, as an
infatuation and a flam, transformed by audacity and intimidation into
two immense humbugs. -
The worst of the Cardinal's bouquet is, that it has a considerably too
strong savour of adulation. lts perfume is not pleasant. If such a
nosegay were stuck in a true man's bosom, it would make him hold
his head up as high as possible.
Mr. Punch does not know what his Eminence of Bordeaux is
pleased to call his flowers of eloquence. Now there is a little modest
flower, just out, with the other Spring publications, about this time,
with which, perhaps, they may be classed, not for their modesty, but
for another reason, in scientific botany. That is the anemone—in plain
English, wind-flower; which seems to Mr. Punch to be the fittest
denomination for these extremely inflated blossoms of balderdash.
Bloomer's Practice of Physic.
AMong the news from America, we observe it is stated, that at
Cleveland, U. S., nine ladies are studying the Homoeopathic system of
medicine. Homoeopathy is a very proper medical system for female
practice. It is to be wished that ladies, in drugging their children,
would always adopt the Homoeopathic plan, and particularly that nurses,
when they wish to “soothe” babies, would limit their remedies to
infinitesimal doses of DAFFY and DALBY.

Parliamentary Chemistry.
MUCH trouble is sometimes experienced in overcoming the resistance
of a refractory Ministerial body. The best mode of manipulation is to
take your PREMIER, reduce him to a very small minority, and stir him
continually till he dissolves.
MUTE ELoquENCE.
THE EARL of DERBy enjoys a reputation for eloquence, and so does
MR. DISRAELI: and yet we find that neither of them can speak out.
A LITTLE NEARER THE TRUTH.—The “Code Civile” no longer
exists in F, ance. It is to be called for the future the “Code Militaire.”
LITERARY INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY.
(From our own Clairvoyant.)
OUR readers will admit the erclusiveness of our intelligence, when
we assure them, that of all the forthcoming works we are enabled to
announce, not one has as, yet reached even the blotting paper of
its author. Thanks to the cerebro-penetrating qualities of “our
own Clairvoyant,” he can discern the baby-bookling in the brain, long
before it is brought to be christened in the inky font.
For their sakes, as well as our own, we are sorry that we cannot
promise our Circulating Librarians much novel-ty at present. With
the exception of another half-dozen or so from MR. JAMEs's never-
flagging nibs, there are but few vestiges of hero-creation now visible
in the cerebral horizon. We may venture to prophesy, however, that
our friend Florence Sackville will shortly be rivalled by Geneva Bagtown;
while The Daffy-down-dilly of St. Peter's will form an appropriate sequel
to The Lily of St. Paul's.
It is almost needless to say that a whole host of petty plagiarists
have laid hold of SIR FRANCIs HEAD's Faggot of French Slicks: which,
as a general rule—proved proverbially by the (“base”) exception—our
contemporaries have most unmercifully cut up. We shall not insult
our readers with the details of this titular trash. Enough that A Bundle
of English Umbrellas stands first upon our list. Ab uno, &c.—the rest
mº readily be imagined. - - -
Jur*... gobemouches will º: to hear that a couple of
political pamphlets are shortly intended. The one is a ventilation squib,
called somewhat aptly The “Bleak House” that Barry built; and “ |.
cated most respectlessly to the King of Architects, by one of his
influenzaed Commons.” The other will also be found to plagiarise the
title of a well-known serial work; for we are telescopically assured
that it will be christened “Our Mess: ” and how we hope to get out of
it. . We are not as yet at liberty to divulge the authorship; but popular
§. will, perhaps, rightly assign it to a literary, and leading
Minister, whose fitness for the Exchequership was doubtless judged
from his eminent expertness in figures (of speech).
We have but space for another intended pamphlet, which in truth we
might almost term a political one, considering with what interest the
question has been recently discussed. (See HANSARD's Great Refresh-
ment Debate, Feb. 4.) ith a frank and engaging quaintness, it is
headed Anything but cold Mutton; being in fact “A Husband's Reply.”
(and a very sensible one too, we think) to LADY CLUTTERBuck's widely
advertised and important query, “h'hat Shall we Have for Dinner?”
THE ENSUING ELECTION.
In these days of electioneering corruption we have reason to look
with peculiar alarm at an advertisement from a respectable firm, which
undertakes to canvass the whole community. This object is to be
effected by means of tents, to be set up by EDGINGTON AND Co., who,
with a shrewd appreciation of the present state of uncertainty in
political opinion, offer to supply for the forthcoming election “all sorts
of mottoes, and all kinds of banners.” Nothing is said about price, but
we have no doubt that all the old Protectionist watchwords, in every
shade and colour, may be had cheap, as they must positively be cleared
off at the next general election, after which no further use can be made
of them. We hope that Colon EL SIBTHORP will introduce a Bill at
once to disfranchise EDGINGTON AND Co., on the ground of their being
ready to sell banners and mottoes to any side that will pay for them.
We, however, do not believe those gentlemen to be any more incon-
sistent than their customers. To accommodate some of these, it is, we
believe, intended, that a number of flags should be prepared, having
“FreeTrade” on one side, and “Protection” on the other. Such an
article would be found well adapted to such constituencies as that
of St. Alban's, which would thus be prepared for any “eligible” candi-
date on either side of the question. We are not aware, whether old
mottoes will be taken in exchange for new, but we have been given to
understand that a new article is coming out, consisting of flags with
inscriptions which may be read either way, and which, it is anticipated,
will be very much in demand by the Ministerial candidates.
He never will be such a Fool'
LoNDoN has not so many handsome buildings that it can afford to
art with a single one—especially one so peculiar, so original, and so
º as the Crystal Palace. We can only say, therefore, that if
John BULL consents to its being pulled down, after erecting it at an
expense of £150,000, he “has been a great fool for his panes.”
THE PRESENT CRY OF THE “country PARTY.”
“Hold hard!” is the motto of the Ministry just now: both as to
the reins of power, and their tongues.

Mr. Roebuck and King Charles.
MR. Roebuck told the folks at Sheffield, that so little
did he care to hide the fact that the necessary expenses of
election were paid for him, that he would print the matter,
“and put it on the statue a' Charing Cross.” . We think
this is a little hard upon KING CHARLEs. Having paid to
the utmost on his own account, why should he, for one
moment, bear the expenses of any other politician? Would
not the statue of the Duke of York be more appropriate
for all bills of expense, especially if unpaid P
You seem
THE REAL “THEATRE of WAR.”—Astley's.
NO JOKE OF LORD DERBY’S.
The FARL of DERBy has been wickedly maligned: he has been
charged with the execution of a joke, when his meaning was the very
best seriousness of which a Prime Minister is ordinarily capable. The
noble Earl, says the Herald, the champion of the Premier's gravity—did
not mean it as an after-dinner joke when he proposed that the militia-
men, about to be raised, should have the franchise in virtue of their
uniform. “Jokes come, in with candles,” says CHARLEs LAMB; but
this axiom applies to ordinary spermaceti, and not to Treasury wax.
Yet well would it be for this melancholy country, implies the Herald,
if the jokes of Prime Ministers were ordinarily of such valuable signifi.
cance, enshrining in their...pleasantness—as a bon-bon contains a moral
in its sweetness—such political worth as the assumed waggery of the
EARL OF DERBy on the enfranchisement of the new militia.
Well, why has such an original, such an instructive thought, been
| abandoned Why has MR. SecketARY WALPole discarded an idea,
so fruitful, so significant? We do not see why directions for voting
might not, at the due season, have alternated with the lessons of drill:—
“Stand at ease.—Purity of Election.”—
“Attention.—Measures, not men.”—
“Shoulder arms.-And up with the Loaf.”—
“Make Ready.—No Bribery.”—
“Present.—No Anti-Corn Laws.”—
“Fire-And down with the League.”
We think the Protectionist Cabinet has lost considerably by foregoing
this original idea. Pipe-clay would have well symbolised the purity of
Protection; and patriotism have met with commensurate reward. Ånd
whereas the militiaman, with the ordinary rifle, should have had, only
one vote, he who would shoulder a doub e-barrel should have enjoyed
two. Moreover, an instalment of the ballot might have been tried with
the militia; for baſis, substituticg bullets.

Oh! where, and oh! where, did the Palace rear its head?
it stood close to the Barracks, with their wall so black and dead;
And it’s, oh! in my heart, that they'd knock'd down that instead!
By what hands, by what hands, did your Crystal Palace fall?
By the nominally great, but in intellect the small; ...
And it’s, oh! in my heart, that they’d heard the public call!
Suppose, and suppose, you should want it back again?.
You might all sit crying over it for twenty years in vain
And it's, oh! in my heart, they'd allow'd it to remain!

THE NEXT “ANNEXATION.”
ARRY, the spirit of enterprise for which
our, Transatlantic kinsmen are re-
markable, is, we, have reason to be-
lieve, about to be exemplified in a
speculation on a considerable scale
of grandeur., The readers of the

with the following significant inti-
mation in reference to the American

(To BE sung AT ALL MINISTERIAL DINNER

Oh! do not take us at our word;
Or heed us whatsoe'er we º:
For that which over-night you heard,
We may, perchance, retract to-day.
Though on a new Militia scheme
Last night our Secretary spoke,
Regard it as an idle dream; .
'Twas but an after-dinner joke.
Though to dissolve we gave a pledge,
d on our promise some have bet;
At once they’d better try and hedge-
We are not quite in earnest yet.
What we upon that topic said
The other day, we now revoke;
Our leader's speech should have been read
As a mere after-dinner joke.
Though we have promised o'er and o'er,

States, and to place the Stars and Stripes on that eminence where formerly floated the flag
of GoDFREY of Bouillon. They do not, however, by any means propose to tread in the
steps of that hero—either, with peas in their boots or without—for his namesake, the
inventor of the famous cordial, is a GoDFREY more likely to be followed by the countrymen of
BARNUM. Their object is to acquire possession of Jerusalem for the purpose of restoring it
to the Hebrew race, for an adequate consideration, of course, in the shape of dollars. They
have also in view, among other inducements, the valuable water privilege of the Jordan; the
waves of which celebrated river will soon probably enter into the composition of sherry
cobbler, cool as the hardihood of the inventors of that refreshing beverage.
So merrily we rule the land–
For novelty is full of charms—
As long as we can make a stand
We fear not all the Whigs in arms.
We feel our right to take our turn
At Government, like other folk;
To grieve at failure we would spurn:
'Tis but an after-dinner joke.
A CLINICAL CASE OF LARCENY.
A PREscRIPTION in BATEs's Pharmacopoeia, illustrative of the state of
medicine some two centuries ago, directs the apothecary to take forty
live toads, burn them a certain time in a crucible, and reduce their
remains to a black powder, adding the scientific remark, that “it
prevaileth admirably in the cure of the epilepsy.” -
The physician of DR. BATEs's day was not to be blamed for adminis-
tering toad-charcoal to his epileptic patients. He practised according
to the science of the period, and following BATEs and the other lights
of it, might have innocently prescribed powder of calcined reptiles, or
mummy, or fiddlestick's end. - -
Penal law is moral physic, and judges and magistrates can only
administer punishments as medical doctors do remedies, conformably
to the rules of the faculty, and the received maxims of legal thera-
peutics. - - -
Mr. Punch may, therefore, in a case of crime, object to the treatment
without accusing the practitioner; demur to the sentence, without
denouncing the judge. *::: this distinction will be noted, Mr. P.
solicits attention to the following circumstances. By various news-
papers it is reported that at
“LAMBETH.-Edward WHITE, an urehim of only 10 years of age, was charged before
the Hon. G. C. Nonton, with stealing a penny biscuit from a little girl in the public
street.
“The mother of the youthful delinquent, a decent-looking woman, who appeared
overwhelmed with grief, informed the magistrate that for upwards of three years her
son had been a most artful and confirmed thief. Every means had been resorted to by
herself and her husband to cure him of his propensities, but it was all to no purpose;
and the boy himself said that his disposition to thieve was so strong that he could not
resist it. When punished, and even tied up for weeks together, he said it was of no use;
that he was a regular JACK SheppahD, and should pursue the same course.”
So it would seem that this child was not one of those that are spoilt
by sparing the rod. A good trial, doubtless, had been given to birch,
cane, strap, and the like counter-irritants, for the cure of this largenous
prurigo of the fingers. But the complaint was obstinate; as will further
appear from what ensues:–
“Ma. Noaron. Has he ever been in custody before?
“MoTHER. He has been frequently given into custody, but on account of his extreme
.." and my interfering in his behalf, the parties let him off. He has been brought
ome at all hours for being found on different premises, and has frequently carried
away everything he could lay his hands on in my place.
“Ma. Norton (to the Prisoner). Well, what have you got to say to this extraordinary
conduct of yours—this disposition of yours to thieve, and carry away everything you
can lay your hands on?
“PhIsoxEB (coolly). I wish I could leave it off, but I cannot.
“MB. Nortox. Indeed! and so you will be a Jack SIIEPPARD?
* PRISONER. Yes, Sir!
“MR. Nonton. I must see and cure you of these propensities; and shall begin by
seeing what 10 days' solitary imprisonment and a sound whipping will do.”
The medicine as before. The only remedy that DR. Norton—not,
mark, by his own fault, but by that of his Pharmacopoeia—can prescribe.
How might the medicine have been expected to act, even if experience
had not proved it likely to fail? A child displays a propensity to steal
at seven years of age, and at ten appears, to be an incorrigible little
prig; is sensible of a thievish impulse which he wishes to restrain, but
cannot. Does not all this imply a real deformity of mind; and is it
not as wise to attempt to cure that by flagellation as it would be to
resort to the same process for the removal of the hump between
Mr. Punch's shoulders ?
The acquisitive instinct is asserted by phrenologists to be connected
with a portion of brain that forms an actual hump, or bump, when
“acquisitiveness” is out of proportion to the other feelings and
faculties. Illustrations of this fact may be seen in MR. Donov AN's
window in King William Street, Strand, next door to the Roman
Catholic meeting-house. They consist in the casts of the heads of
certain rogues, and if there is any truth in phrenology, the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners, with the consent of prelates who shall be nameless,
might furnish MR. Donovan with more. At any rate, an excessive
desire to appropriate is a tumour of the soul, whether or not, it is
connected with a swelling of the head, and is not likely to be abated
§ the raising of wheals on the back: at least according to the
philosophy of Mr. Punch. - -
That a confirmed scoundrel should be kept in check—if possible—by
the beneficent whip recommended by DR. THOMAS CARLYLE, Mr. Punch
may concede, because there is no other way to manage him; fear for
his own hide is the only motive he can be supplied with for, not
wronging others. But can all this be predicated of a child of ten ?
Cannot his mind, somehow, be expanded, by some such a thing as edu:
cation, in those directions wherein its proper development would
counteract the love of pilfering? Surely; unless, it is irremediably
dwarfed and shrunken in its higher regions; and in that case, an Asylum
for Idiots might be suggested in preference to the whipping-post. .
It is, at ºfevents, the opinion of Mr. Punch, M.R.C.S., that flogging
will not remove a constitutional propensity to steal, and if tried for that
purpose, will be found to be a useless laceration of integument:...and
per º: in a more advanced state of psychology, such a remedy will be
thought as absurd as we now think DR. BATEs’s burnt toads.
SILENCE –The only tongue allowed in the French Assembly, is that
of the President's bell; and even that, we hear, is muffled!

MISS VIOLET AND HER “OFFERS.”
---
CHAPTER III.
It was considerably past high noon on a beautiful summer's day,
during the earlier portion of the reign of the British QUEEN VICTORIA,
when two individuals, of different sexes, were seen making their way,
in an easterly direction, along the cliffs of Brighton. The sun shone
out brightly; and, if the birds did not sing upon the trees, it was
º cause there were no trees for them to sing upon. But the
sea, dashing upon the shingles, made its own rough music; and, far
away on the horizon line, the white sails of the fishing-boats, "...;
in the light, might seem the wings of some preternatural beings,
sentinelling the rock-bound island of the free.
I feel it right, as the authoress of these papers, to state that the
above beautiful piece of writing is not my own, but was kindly given
me, as a beginning, by a celebrated novelist of the day, who happened
to call while I was puzzling my poor little head how to commence my
story befittingly, F. quite afraid that there will be no more like it,
and that it will resemble the splendid copper-plate writing with which
our writing-master at school used to begin each of the pages, sadly
contrasted by the weak, irresolute up-strokes and down strokes of
the pupils.
Well, one of these “individuals,” the gentleman, was my papa. He
is still a very handsome man, who, I am quite sure, remains a widower
only because he chooses, for there are hundreds of charming girls who
would jump at him. His manly and erect figure would look perfectly
imposing in uniform; and, if those dreadful French should come, and
º: should have to arm in our defence, I am positive that the instant
e comes upon parade he will be chosen Lord Lieutenant, or whatever
the highest rank in the militia may be. He is so cheerful, and so good-
naturedly sarcastic, that he is quite delightful society for any one who
understands him: but I think that most of the young men whom we
know are rather afraid of him. As we used to walk along the cliffs, or
on the Parade, the wind doing its best to blow us into the heart of
Sussex, and papa striding steadily onwards, pulling poor little me with
him, and every now and then turning his dear old face full upon the
sea, as much as to ask the wind which of them it thought would be
tired first, I used to feel as proud of him as it was possible under the
circumstances; namely, my breath being quite taken away, my bonnet
turning from side to side like the cowſ ºf a chimney-pot, and my dress
doing its best to get back to the comfortable warm wardrobe out of
which it had been taken.
The other of the two º: was myself. Now, I am always
delighted when, in a novel, I come, to the description of the heroine,
and read how her º: hair lay in braids of exquisite smoothness, and
how their rich dark purple contrasted with the polished alabaster of her
complexion. But I must dispense with all this in my own case, for 1
have been obliged to introduce myself at a moment when . hair was
anything but smooth, or in exquisite braids, and my complexion was
just the reverse of either polished or alabaster. For we had been down
at Brighton some time, and what with bathing (which makes it quite
impossible to keep one’s hair mice), and what with boating, and fishing,
. and general exposure to the weather (for I can't bear those
“uglies,” which look like models, in blue, of the canvas-enclosures at
the end of the bathing machines)—I say of all the sun-browned, gipsy:
looking things you ever saw, I had become the wildest. Qf course, all
that is over now, and I have regained my drawing-room looks (whatever
they may be); but, on the day of which I speak, I should be telling a
most dreadful story if I said that, Miss WIOLET BROMPTON, jºi y
the side of her papa, looked anything but a pretty girl (I will say that)
in the best health and the sauciest spirits, and in one of the loveliest
morning dresses you ever saw, (I will say that, too) and I must
reluctantly leave all the rest of my personal advantages to be inferred
from the sayings and doings of º: It is not for me to make
the observation that the young men of the present day are not blind, and
that there are plenty of ſovely girls in the world; and, therefore, that
if one obtains an unusually large share of attention, there must be
something about one distinguishing one from other people.
Papa likes places for such odd reasons. One gentleman likes
Brighton, because you come tearing down from town in less time than
it takes an omnibus to get from the City to Hampstead. Another,
because BRILL's bath is the finest plunge he knows. Another (a selfish
greedy creature), because he can get a,better dinner at the Bedfo
than #: poor dear wife, who is always ill, can give him at Camberwell.
Papa likes Brighton because the Parade is, he says, a great shelf on
which all sorts of types of past days are put ºf don't pretend to
understand all his historical allusions, (though. I flatter myself. I do
know rather more history than little CAPTAIN WELwyN, who objected
to go to LADY L-ND-ND-RRy’s bal costumé as Edward the Black Prince,
because he did not like a character which, he conceived, required him
to blacken his face,) but it is very amusing to hear papa point out the
eople who have figured in times gone by. , There are old, wicked-
ooking men, with thin faces, long noses, and quaint hats, who have
drunk Regent punch with KING GEORGE THE Fourth at the poor
Pavilion, and have seen the King make his coats fit in the wonderful
manner they did, by snipping off every wrinkle with a pair of scissors,
and having the holes fine drawn. There comes a gentleman in nankeen,
with bright brass, buttons on his light-blue coat. He toddles along on
his ivory-headed bamboo º enough now, but he was another sort
of person one evening about fty-two years ago, when, as he will tell
you (winking wonderfully at nothing), he was planted in the first row of
the pit on the first night of Pizarro, to cheer all the patriotic speeches.
He carries a snuff-box which was John, KEMBLE's, with the t
º autograph, under a piece of glass, in the lid. This officer
in the Bath chair, who is always muttering, and who makes his servant
wheel him out in the worst weathers, helped LoRD NElson to bombard
Boulogne, and hopes, he says, before he goes to Heaven, to hear that
the same thing has been done again, only with more success, and that
“poor PARKER” has been avenged. This is SIR AUDREY BLATCH, in
the great coat, buttoned to the chin. He refused to look at the

Koh-i-Noor, at the Great Exhibition, because in 1802 he bid for the Pigot diamond, as agent
for a Russian Princess (upon whose hand he had designs), and having gone as high as nine
thousand guineas, he was afraid to go higher;-it was knocked down for nine thousand five
hundred—the Russian lady threw him over in a huff, and “he has hated the sight of diamonds
ever since.” But these two very old ladies in the low carriage are much more interesting
people. One of them, when a girl, was a sort of maid-of-honour to the Duchess of KINgston
when that dreadful person was tried before the House of Lords for having married two
husbands, and gave evidence for which LADY KITTY CRocodiLE, as Foote called her, flew
at her with a horsewhip when she got home—she has a scar on her neck, they say, from one
of the Duchess's slashes. The other, with a black wig and shades over her eyes, is her cousin,
and still older, and has had love made to her by MIRABEAu, and was herself in love with
BARRINgton, the pickpocket—neither connection over-respectable. And there is a Swiss
lady in mourning, which she has worn for nearly sixty years—she was a protegée of MADAME
DU BARRY, and was compelled to witness the poor creature's guillotining, after which she
escaped from France in male clothes, and never returned. She lives in one room with a
large bay window, and has a wonderful collection of lovely little china boxes, painted with
shepherds and shepherdesses, which she likes to show to people, poor old thingſ. These are
some of the folks papa has pointed out to me in our walks, and especially about the time we
have been going to Mutton’s for our ice—the errand on which the “individuals” were bound,
at the time so beautifully described for me at the beginning of this chapter.
That day an odd thing happened; but I can't tell it, properly, until this day week.
THE DUTIES OF A WHITE WAISTCOAT.
270ST people know that Loºp
- John MANNERs belongs to
the Young England School,
and in that capacity always
wears a White Waistcoat; for
no Young Englander is to the
heart a Young Englander, un-
less his heart beats against a
spotless White Waistcoat.
It may be as well, therefore,
º, to inquire—since White Waist-
| coats have had such a lift on
the “body politic”—what the
duties of a White Waistcoat
- º N
are.
These duties consist as fol-
lows:–
Never to show itself, except-
ing in the very best circles-
the dress-circles, we may say,
of society—for fear of its purity
becoming stained, by mixing
with the inferior classes who
go to the Pit and Gallery.
To profess a great love for
popular amusements; and yet to be the foremost in smashin r attempting to smash-
anything that promises to promote them—as in the instance of the Crystal Palace.
o wish to revive the sports and pastimes of the Middle Ages—which is curious enough,
for that was a period when White Waistcoats were unknown. -
To desire to go back—whereas it is well-known that a properly-constituted White Waistcoat
never goes backward, but rather delights in standing boldly out in the front of things. -
To express an utter contempt whether our wealth, trade, commerce, arts, sciences, perish
or not, as long as we have our “Old Nobility” left.
To give the people plenty of cricket, trap-and-ball, rounders, greasy poles, jigs, reels, and
Sir Roger, de Goverleys, varied occasionally with a bath or a lecture, to make them perfectly
º and sublimely indifferent whether they have political rights or not.
a short to send society back as near to the Middle Ages as possible, when life was one
continual dancing round a May-pole, and such a thing as the “Poor Man” was unknown.
wº º: are the duties which every one who wears a White Waistcoat should have nearest
S Dreasº.
WANTED, A WIFE-APPLY AT THE TUILERIES.
THE French President, it is said, is turning his serious thoughts towards a serious
subject—matrimony. And with this intent he is getting rid of an old love, in due obedi-
ence to the old saw, ere he begin with a new. The Elysée is to be cleared and lustrated,
and then Louis NAPOLEoN will take a wife. The next question is—whom is he to take?
A Princess of Sweden stood high upon the Presidential list; but it is said she has recently
embraced the Protestant º ; and this choice makes the poor girl ineligible. - -
The EMPERoR of Russia has no daughters to spare: again, the Autocrat is despotic in
the matter of the Greek creed, and insists that his sons and daughters-in-law shall fall in,
ike a line of soldiery, to his way of thinking. - - - -
Prussia is, unfortunately, Protestant; and there is nothing sufficiently high and promising
in the Court of Austria.
Spain has nothing better than a daughter or so—by a left-handed Hymen-of the
pinchbeck Duke RIANZAREs.
Portugal might offer; but as yet is silent.
Holland's religion forbids any banns.
--
Belgium has “no daughter to marry;” and
Louis NApoleon would, in popular phrase, be
an ul } neighbour as a son-in-law.
W. l, failing in royal blood, we see but one
lady whose moral courage and whose social
renown are worthy of the motoriety achieved
by the President. That lady is—LoLa Montes.
There is, to be sure, a disputed marriage; but
the Pope—who has been so kind and courteous
of late by mouth of a Cardinal—the Pope who,
time out of mind, has been the prime dealer in
fuller's-earth to take out all sorts of spots—the
Pope may annihilate the past, the present, and
the future, and make two lovers—when they
love—supremely happy.
PARALLELS FOR PROTECTIONISTS.
THERE are certain landlords who have quite as
much right to compensation for the losses they
have sustained through legislative enactments,
as any individuals of #. class, though their com-
plaints have not been loud, albeit deep, and how-
ever much savouring of the nature of imprecations.
We allude to certain functionaries connected
with the Shrievalty, and mostly of the Hebrew
persuasion, who before arrest on mesne process
was abolished, were wont to derive magnificent
incomes from the extension of a slightly expen-
sive hospitality to gentlemen in difficulties and
durance.
The deputy of the Sheriff, on whom devolves the
duty of carrying out the ultimatum of the law, is
equally with his brother officers and the landed
aristocracy, entitled to a proper allowance for the
loss of his vested interests, or property in
capital punishment, which he has been in a #.
measure deprived of, by the extensive abolition
of hanging.
The Medical profession ought to have been
compensated long ago for the discovery of
JENNER; for vaccination is not nearly so pro-
fitable as small-pox.
HOLIDAY EMPLOYMENT FOR
THE CABINET.
THE EARL OF DERby at Brighton—in humble
imitation of, SIR. Isaac, Newton-picking up
Protection shells (when he finds them) by the
great Sea of Truth.
MR. DisrAELI at Bucks, with a view to the
future Equalisation of the Burdens on Land, cal-
culating how many black beans make five.

MATRI MONY
MADE EASY.
THE following letter has been sent to our Office, evidently in
mistake:-
“Matrimonial Office, Union Court, Love Lane.
“S “ (STRICTLY PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.)
t IR,
“You R esteemed favour of the 10th ult. came duly to hand,
and, agreeably to F. desire, we have the honour to forward to you our
quarterly sheet o º likenesses of our Female Clients. We
were very sorry that the ies you fixed upon in our last year's sheets
were all engaged before your duly honoured application arrived at our
Office; but we hope to be more fortunate in our present sheet, which
we flatter ourselves contains some highly eligibles. We should, how-
ever, recommend as early an *. as possible, as this being leap:
year, Ladies are looking up, and considerably risen in the Market, and
shares in their affections and fortunes are now much above Should
you not be particular to a shade, we should respectfully leave to
recommend No. 7, her father having very large estates near fi.i.
to which she will be sole heiress, in case of her twenty-seven brothers
dying without issue. And should the Great African East and West
Railway be carried forward, the value of the Estates would be prodi.
giously increased. No. 8 is a sweet poetess, whose “Remains” would
probably be a fortune to any Literary Gent, to publish after her
ar.
decease. No. 9 has been much approved by Gents, having buried
eight dear partners, and is an eighth time inconsolable.
‘Further particulars may be had on application at our Office.
“We beg also, respectfully, to inform you that your esteemed
portrait was duly received and appeared in, our last Gent.’s sleet of
Clients; but we are sorry to say as yet no inquiries respecting it have
come to hand.
“Permit us further to remind you that a year's subscription was due
on the 1st of January, which, with arrears amounting to £4 4s, we shall
be greaty obliged by your remitting by return of post.
“With most respectful impatience, awaiting a renewal of your ever:
esteemed applications, and assuring you that they shall be duly attended
to with all despatch, secrecy, and punctuality,
“We have the honour to be,
“Esteemed Sir,
“Your most obedient Servants,
“HookHAM AND SPLIceR,
“Sole Matrimonial Agents for Great Britain.
“P.S.—We find our female clients run much on moustaches. Would
you allow us humbly to suggest the addition of them to your portrait
in our next Quarterly Sheet? It could be done at a slight expense, and
would probably ensure your being one of our fortunate clients.”
MUSIC FOR THE POPE'S BRASS BAND,
Mr. Punch has employed an eminent composer to set the words of
the popular song “There's a Good Time Coming, Boys,” to a new tune, or
to speak, perhaps, rather more correctly, to an old one. Hope is tellin
a tale, which º the kind and wise permission of rival factions, is, if
flattering, not likely to prove illusory to those dear priests, who are so
strenuously endeavouring to decorate the stiff necks of Englishmen
with “the sweet yoke of Rome.”. As the Times, in a recent leader,
says, in reference to the Island of Saints—the land of veracity, tran-
quility, and tenderness of human life:
“The recent misfortunes have swept away many of the gentry, who, whatever their
other faults, were yet, by the extensive possessions of which they were the nominal
owners, bulwarks against the influence of the priests. That bulwark is removed, and,
from this and other concurrent causes, we are to expect a fearful increase to the
numbers of the Irish Brigade. In the nicely balanced state of English parties, these
nominees of DocToks CULLEN and WIsrman will possess great power.”
Considering this ; considering how beneficially the influence of
CULLEN and WISEMAN has been working of late in Parliament; how
it has tended to promote union amongst reformers, and to expedite the
business of the country; what advantages we are likely to derive from
its increase; what wholesome restraints upon the . of speakin
and of the Press ; what an i. to moral, intellectual, and physi
research, and to education; what pleasant interferences with our family
arrangements; what an interesting, emasculation of our national
character; and what a salutary humiliation of the English name, are
likely to result from the predominance of the papal party in the House
of Commons, and therefore, proportionally, from the augmentation of
the holy Irish, Brigade:, for these various considerations, affecting the
prºperty and glory of his native land, Mr. Punch has caused the song
‘There's a Good Time Coming, Boys,” to be arranged to the “Gregorian
Chant,” to be sung by all Jesuits, Oratorians, Passionists, and in all
and sundry monasteries, nunneries, and convents, whereof the inmates
are *...*. the subjection of this realm of England to the Roman
See; and also after dinner, in those loyal societies, where the Pope's
health is proposed before her MAJESTY's, in lieu of the heretical anthem
of “God save the Queen.”
...How easy, to be sure, it would be for the Ministers and the Oppo-
sition to combine against WISEMAN and CULLEN, and neutralise the
blessing of an additional batch of Irish Members, º passing, imme-
diately, a judicious measure of reform, providing for the corresponding
enlargement of the English and Scotch constituencies But that party
jealousies forbid.: so, ye monks and friars, and foreigners who desire to
humble proud, Albion in the dust, sing away “There’s a Good Time
Coming, Boys,” through your noses.
ANSWER TO A FAIR CORRESPONDENT.
“MR. PUNCH 'presents his compliments to the young Lady who is
50 anxious to know the age of LQRd JoHN MANNERs, and begs to say
he doesn't know; but, inferring from the fact of LoRD John wishing
to revive the Mediæval times, Mr. Punch would think that his Lordship
must be a Middle-aged man.”

FOR THE MIND !
oMMEND me, Mr. Punch,
to a capital article in
the Church Review on
the Morality of the
Stomach! It is gratify-
ing to find a Church
organ directing its at-
tention seriously to the
state of the interior.
The Reviewer dis-
courses º on
DR. MooRE's orthodox
text,
“The regulation of our
appetite is among the chief
of our daily duties."
“His sentiments are
not those of a Puseyite
or what I callan Oxfor
fast-man. He has mobias
towards soupe maigre, or
any other superstition.
He does not recommend
red-herrings, but refine-
ment. Hetrulyobserves,
“‘It is said that no fact is better established than that diet greatly modifies the
temper."
“How often have I experienced this great truth when my steak has
been overdone, and I could get no pickles! And he continues,
** Hence GALEx told the philosophers to send all the bad characters to him.”
“What a beautiful prospect of the amelioration of our species this
sentence opens up! Hitherto, in trying to discover the right system
of convict-discipline, we have been beating about the bush. We have
found it at last; fare is the thing; an entirely new system of prison-diet.
We must, as the Church Reviewer says, “feed the industries and the
virtues with their daily bread, from among the riches of this kind which
the earth is instructed to yield.” The daily bread of the industries and
virtues is not brown Tommy. The Reviewer appears to mean fruit by
it. He has apples in his eye, apparently; gooseberries and currants
also, and the other natural delicacies of the season. So, then, instead
of from three months' treadmill or oakum, we may hope to have the
offenders of a new era sentenced to certain terms of pine-apple, or
strawberries and cream.
“Does the earth really bring forth natural remedies for moral evils?
I wonder what vice truffles, are good for?. Would I not set about
reforming it in earnest, if subject to it, which I should almost wish I
was No matter. I will take the antidote on speculation. I dare say
that there is some poison in my mature that it may counteract.
“I know I am troubled with a slight acidity of temper; and believe
that I have more than once found it corrected by stewed mushrooms.
“I hope, however, that fruits and other vegetable productions are
not the only aliments of the virtues and industries. From the rapidity
with which subscriptions pour in after a charity dinner, I am strongly
inclined to think that real turtle is nutritious to munificence, and 1
wish it were the daily, instead of the occasional, food of that principle
in myself. The same remark may be made of whitebait, and, indeed, of
venison, and the other elements of a truly generous banquet, inclusive
of º beverages, from iced punch to champagne, and so on, which
attend it.
“Some kinds of food, it is well known, increase the bulk of the
muscles; others run to fat. If the brain has distinct organs, one species
of comestible may go to nourish one; another may be the special
pubulum of another. Underdone beef may have a determination to
destructiveness-milk, to benevolence; having thus, in reality, the
relation to human kindness ascribed to it by a form of speech.
“This theory appears to be borne out by the fact, that indulgence in
too many good things occasions (unfortunately) a general fulness of the
head, tending to apoplexy.
“In these days of Socialism, Communism, Fourrierism, and the like
wild theories, it is refreshing to meet with so sensible a notion as the
gastronomic regeneration of Society.
“I say that the Church Review deserves our best thanks for the light
it has thrown upon fasting, which, philosophically considered, is merely
abstinence from all food likely to disagree with the higher faculties.
For my part, I intend to reform and repent on a series of good dinners.
I shall exemplify the precept of that excellent ecclesiastic who sings,
“He who leads a good life is sure to live well.'
“Experiments only can determine on what particular delicacies we
should cultivate our better feelings. I should be ha º to institute
researches into this branch of Moral Philosophy, if I #: the means;
enthusiastic.
and a few subscriptions to encourage so laudable a study, will hardly
be grudged by the fablic—will re ily, 1 trust, be taken in by you—
and will, I am sure, be thankfully received by your humble servant,

A NEW CHAUNT FOR ROCHESTER CHOIR.
WE’RE surprised, MR. WHISTON, you thus should insist on
Your scandalous º 'gainst dignities high;
Putting forth a vile bead-roll, which proves each Cathedral
A den of thieves, robbing small boys on the sly!
A Son of the Church, too, and wielding the birch, too,
Within the dread shadow of Rochester's pie,
When you ought to have capp'd her Dean, Bishop, and Chapter,
To show them allup in this merciless style!
And when you’ve the face, sir, to make out your case, sir,
With facts and with figures that none can deny;
What means the denial you make on your trial,
Of “gravius DELIctum.”—“crime i. of die?”
If our ancestors foolish had notions so schoolish,
In this nineteenth century, sure you don’t mean'
To contend that the birchings of fifty young urchins
Ought to cost half as much as the keep of a Dean?
With changed value of money, there's nothing so funny
In the charge of a Canon being duly increased;
But it raises one's choler to be told that a scholar
Ought to have his allowance enlarged like a priest.
As one, sir, who teaches, you should heal, not make breaches,
And by your example to meekness invite;
Not set on inferiors to
º: their superiors,
And drag disagreeable truths into light.
Zeal lacking discretion don't suit your º
And to tell truth at all times is only for fools;
Why, if you must write, sir, not speak your delight, sir,
At the way Deans and Chapter. behave to their schools?
Had you praised our discerning, unselfishness, learning,
Our strong sense of justice, by courtesy ruled,
Laid it on hard and hot, sir, for all that we’re not, sir–
You’d never have been as you now are, unschooled.
MUMMERY AT MIDNIGHT.
ExETER is a soil fruitful in extravagance. A Bishop has blessed the
see, and lo! it is monstrously prolific. During Passion Week, one
REv. S. LEE, of the parish of All Hallows, announced his intention of
holding a “Midnight Mass.” The thing, however, was not permitted,
doubtless to the Christian sorrow of the Tractarian experimentalist;
otherwise, we are informed, the matter would have come off, as they
print in the play-bills, with “new and startling effects.” Many of the
zealous would have typified the faith within them, by carrying to the
Mass a dark-lanthorn; whilst fancy-dresses, a la Guy Fawkes-with
the supplementary grace of a mask—had been bespoken by the more

RULES FOR HEALTH.
By a Scotch Philosopher, who has tried them all.
Never drink anything but water.
Never eat anything but oatmeal.
Wear the thickest boots.
Walk fifteen miles regularly every day. - -
Avoid all excitement; consequently it is best to remain single, for
then you will be free from allhousehold cares and matrimonial troubles,
and you will have no children to worry you. -
The same ruie applies to smoking, taking snuff, playing at cards, and
arguing with an Irishman. They are all strong excitements, which
must be rigidly avoided, if you value in the least your health. ---
By attending carefully to the above rules, there is every probability
that you "...i. to a hundred years, and that you will enjoy your
hundredth year fully as much as you did your twenty-first.

Whom the juvenile student confidingly crams
They’re nothing but fudges imposed on young drudges--
Chimeras of bottled smoke, phantoms, and shams.
The doubts }. awaken, so wholly have shaken
Our belief, that, in short, it is equally small
As regards ancient Romans, and ghosts, dreams, and omens;
For we almost suspect there weren't any at all.
The QUIRITEs we question ; and for our digestion
The PATREs CoNSCRIPTI are something too tough;
With consuls and lictors, whom boa-constrictors
May swallow; and tribunes, and ediles, and stuff.
We doubt both HoRATII, and eke CURIATII;
And infer that their fight could have never occurr'd :
In the DECII oft Quoted, so called self-devoted,
We consider all credence as simply absurd.
In the two brothers GRACCHUs, no more than in BAccHUs,
Do we put any faith : we class Piso with PAN,
And METELLUs with JANUs, and CorIolanus
With APOLLO, convinced there was no such a man.

And she doesn’t boggle—of pictures that goggle,
Or statues that nod, one more glaringly bold.

Is forced with the eye of suspicion to look;
And will the oration bear investigation
In which they say CICERo brought him to book?
Of BRUTUs and CAssius we can't be so rash as
To credit one half, if one word, that we read;
And Pompey and CAESAR by many degrees are
Too apocryphal fellows to hold in our creed.
There are SALLUST and LIvy—we’d trust HookHAM SNIvey
As soon as the former—must take, we're afraid,
The other one's statements with suchlike abatements
As we do those which BARON MUNCHAUSEN has made.
Of the scoundrels and heroes—the CAtos and NERos—
We are led to adopt one like sceptical view;
For their actions related so long back are dated,
And so very far off, we can scarce think them true.
You prove ancient History so clouded with mystery,
We’d as readily credit a troubadour's rhymes;
And the Past seems with fable so mixed, that we’re able
To believe little more than we read in the Times.

CHAPTER IV.
As if I cared in the least about the creature! or had given him the
least tinny-tiny bit of encouragement in the whole world ! And yet
apa has been going on at me, in his quiet teasing manner, for I don't
§. how long. . Just as if it was my fault! or as if there was any
fault at all anywhere, except that stupid MR. Mutton's, for not having
his shop made twenty times as large as it is, so that people could eat
their ices without other people brushing so closely by them, in passing,
as to knock the spoon out of their hands, and so give more people an
excuse for getting other spoons and presenting them. ...Not that I see
much harm in that, but papa is so aggravating when he likes. I believe
he could talk round and round a Bijou Almanac until it seemed a Post
Qffice Directory. And then he's so good-natured all the time, that—
But I promised to tell all about it.
suppose everybody in the world knows MUTTON's at Brighton.
Papa calculates that on an average, during the season, 2000 jokes are
made, every week, on the unfortunate man's name. Every new-comer
of course, considers it his duty to be smart on poor MR. MUTTON, and
wonders that people who have been down at Brighton for three days
don’t laugh. Even papa himself made a joke about him, but it was in
Latin, and Adãº. two fast Oxford men, who, of course, did not
understand it. But DR. CloistERs, Dean of St. MILDEw's (who
knows that papa is intimate with several Bishops), applauded it so
heartily, that I made him write it down for me. Some . officers,
it seems, had been running in debt with MR. MUTTON, who could never
get any money from them. But as two of them came into the shop
one day, papa, quoting the Fourth Satire of HoRAce (“c. 12,” the
Dean has written, but I don’t know what that means), described them
as people,
“Longa quibus facies Ovis erit;"
which I understand meant people to whom MR. Mutton would pull a
º
ell, Mutton's was very full, and we were all taking our lunch in
that comfortable state of squeeze common at supper-time in third-rate
squares, where folks who can't afford to give many parties, ask three
times as many people as the poor little house will hold. One don’t
mind it at supper, however, because sometimes good comes out of it,
and at any rate, it would be ill-natured to complain; but in a hot shop,
in the middle of the day, it is very disagreeable. Papa and I were
separated, and I was standing, and making haste with my strawberry
ice º; my gloves, indeed), in order to get away, when that
MRs. MAJOR KILPIGGIN, of somewhere in Ireland, came ". past
me, with a great plate of smoking soup held tight in both hands (her
gioves were safe enough, for, if she has any, she never brings them out),
and knocked my spoon out of my fingers, sending a dab of strawberry
ice into the red-hot face of GENERAL BANGLE, who was sitting near
me—and serve him right, for his Anglo-Indian selfishness in not giving
me his seat. I expected to hear the ice hiss on his fiery cheek.
MRs. KILPIGGIN held on her way; but looked round, with her good-
natured Irish flºº (there’s no being angry with that merry, vulgar
face), and cried out,
“Ye’ll hould the silver º darlin', when ye're my age.”
(And tight enough she holds it, if all is true that people say about
her; and that plate of soup was her dinner for the day; but, then,
MAJOR KILPIGGIN will play at billiards with everybody, and everybody
will beat him, and half-pay won't go far with billiards and seven children,
poor creatures.) But she never even begged my pardon.
In a moment I was conscious of a very strong odour of tobacco, and
a rather tall man leaned over some others, took a plate, on which was
another spoon about to be handed to somebody else, and offered it to
me, with a sort of grave bow. I took it, of course, and then I thought
I would look at ſº civil person who had given it to me. He was
certainly handsome, but looked as haggard and dispirited as if he had
been up about a hundred nights, and had not been exactly drinking
water all the time. His dress was careless, rather than slovenly, but
altogether he had the look and manner of a gentleman. And that is
all I should have ever thought about the matter; but as I looked at
him, he actually coloured. Now, gentlemen do not often do this;
but when such an accident does happen, they always, seem heartil
ashamed of themselves. But this person, although his face flushed .

over, appeared quite unconcerned about it, and, indeed, about everything else,
except my poor little face, at which he continued to look, not exactly staring, but
with a fixed gaze, like that mentioned in the CHANCELLoR OF THE #º.
Novels, when the heroine meets somebody who is “her Destiny.” Perhaps 1
stood his look the hundredth part of a moment longer than was quite proper, but
his face interested me, and I was thankful for the spoon. And then P looked at
my ice, and the next moment rude old GENERAL BANGLE got up and stretched
himself along the counter to get at another great sticky Bath-bun. In an instant
his chair was taken from behind him by my haggard-looking friend, and placed
for me, and the General, never dreaming of what had happened, would have gone
down on the floor, but for the other saying, in a careless kind of way,
“Thank you; I'm sure you’re very polite.”
I do not think such a charge had ever been brought against GENERAL BANGLE
round, with natural indigmation, to meet his accuser, he
I would have

saw his chair gone, and the stranger motioning to me to take it.
slipped away, but the crowd prevented me, and there was nothing between
standing by a chair, looking awkward, and taking it. So I did the latter, but with
such a§§§ smile of thanks to the old General, that if he had not been a
dreadful old Bengal royal tiger, he would have been delighted, instead of enraged.
As it was, however, I am, ashamed to say that he not only muttered the word
impertinent,” so loud, that everybody around could hear, but actually put
anºther word before it, which papa calls “the theological equivalent for very.”
Everybody looked round, and I was in terror that I was going to be made the
centre of a scene. But my new friend had not the slightest intention that I should
be placed in a false position; for, turning completely from me, and, in fact, inter-
poſſing between me and the angry General, he said, quite loud and cordially,
-- §h, GENERAL BANGLE! I beg your pardon, I did not recognise you.”
-- Sir. said the General, (I could not see his face, but his voice was very furious)
I, dºn't know you, but I know—”
My friend W9BBY WATTLE: you were going to say you knew him? Yes. I
had the pleasure of seeing you at his rooms the day you called” (this was said very
distinctly) “tº pay the fifty pounds you lost to him at cartºon Sunday week. He’s
very well, and eager to give the revenge you promised to take.”
l, could not, as I have said, see the General; but what I could see was the face
ºf his wife, who had been sitting near him. Fiery as the General is, Mrs.
GENERAL Bascis is his implacable superior officer. Terrible as he is to the
world, to him she is far more terrible. She is a rigid, theologian, (Clapham
patent), and a still more rigid financialist. And here was her husband convicted
at once of gambling and of losing, and of doing both on a Sunday. As I glanced
at her face, which was at a white-heat, I thought how
much better it would have been for the General, if he had
offered me the chair originally, like an officer and a
gentleman.
| “GENERAL BANGLE lose fifty pound at cards !” she
almost screamed. “You can't know what you are talking
about, young man.” And her eyes quite flashed.
“Having had the honour of being witness to the pay-
ment.” º the other with great politeness, “I can
testify to the alacrity of the General in discharging his play
| obligations. I gave Wobby cash for the cheque, to save
him the trouble of going to-to RANsom's—I think that is
your banker's, General?”
“You were in town on Sunday week, BANGLE,” said the
lady, in a low deadly voice, “and you told me the name of
the chapel you went to three times that day, and the heads
of the three discourses. We had better go home. Bring
the Bath bun with you, as, having been broken, it must be
paid for, I conclude.” And the General was taken away to
undergo the peine forte et dure, it is supposed, and he has
not been heard of since.
Papa, as the little scene ended, was º near me,
eatly amused. I told him in two words how it had arisen.
saw he was looking very curiously at the gentleman who
had caused it, and who, I felt, had resumed his original
occupation of admiring Miss BRomPTON. -
“MR. Any — Something?” said papa, in his
good-natured manner, “Were younot dining at the Parthian
Club about amonth since, with MR. NiMRod McBLAzes, the
great mammoth slayer?” I think papa knows everybody.
“ALBANY Swelington,” said the gentleman, looking
immensely delighted, and expecting, I º believe, that he
was going to be presented to me.
“Ah!” said papa, “how tough that saddle of mutton
was, that day! me, Violet, my dear, let us have a
blow on the pier.” . .
I could not help giving poor ALBANY one look as we
went out, but papa need not have noticed it.
ROSAS WITHERING."
The despots of the continent will perhaps consider that
we Englishmen are atoning for our protection to liberal
refugees—our great º º: protection to Rosas.
Yes, Rosas has actually landed here, and taken up his
abode on our domestic hearth!—the tiger-cat is sprawling
comfortably before the English fire. -
One thing is perfectly clear. Something must be done
for Rosas. A whisper has gone abroad that the excellent
tyrant is in reduced circumstances. Now is the time for
the reactionary party. Pay your money, gentlemen. You
don’t surely intend that Rosas shall have to resort to
public mendicancy. We cannot think without a tear
(which may be seen at the office) of Rosas sitting on the
pavement—drawing with coloured chalk the head of Judas
on the stones to excite the sympathy of reactionaries!.
The younger Dionysius, in old times, when kicked
out of his kingdom, turned schoolmaster. But modern
tyrants have not the necessary knowledge to fill that
situation. - -
Twopence more! This is the great Rosas who supplied
the jails and gallows of his country so long. Business in
that line falling short, Rosas has been obliged to withdraw,
and throw himself on the charity of the inhuman. The
application, we believe, is to be backed up by a fragment
from the appropriate Beggar's Opera-
“Rosas and party their wants disclose;
Tip him some money for victuals and hose:"
or, if there should appear to be an indecorous levity about
that, Punch will have no objection to dash off a parody
about Rosas by Bendemeer's Stream, as his contribution
to the subscription. We hope to hear of its being set on
foot soon; for, if Rosas is in difficulties, how can he go to
the fashionable balls of the season? unless, indeed, he
can manage to do, what he made his countrymen often
do–dance upon nothing!

tives of Hyde
Park propose to
have their First of
May. The refined
crowd—the perſumed mob-the delicate and exquisite rabble of May
Fair—have vowed to destroy the people's chrysolite—the Crystal
Palace—to have, in fact, their destructive First of May.
The Tenth of April saw FEARGUs O'Connor in all his pride of
eneralship. And, for the First of May, we may read—“LORD
EYMoUR, vice FEARGus O'Connor, superseded.”
That Tenth of April is still a grand day in the memory of the men of
order. Even now, eloquent Members of Parliament, touching upon
the “political earthquakes that have rocked, and crushed, and scattered
foreign Constitutions,”—even now, they glowingly apostrophise “that
reat moral triumph of the Tenth of April.” We have no doubt that the
rench President, himself a constable on that eventful day, is now and
then suffused with a recollection of its glory.
Well, threatening, anarchy was defeated by a combination of the
orderly and the pacific. Let us, on the First of May to come, adopt
the like means triumphant on the Tenth of April, now historic. Let
all the wise, andIf..." and peace-loving combine to put down the

What says SIR. Joseph PAxton P What does he promise the
people by the conservation of the Crystal Palace? Hearken!
* Three modes of appropriating the Crystal Palace may be at present specified, with
sufficient distinctness, to show how it is intended to combine the instruction and
recreation of the people with the advancement of the arts, science, and manufactures.
“In the first place, a portion of the space may be allotted to a winter garden embel-
lished with fountains, statuary, geological specimens, and a great variety of other
interesting objects.
“Another portion might be appropriated for the reception of new inventions and of
a ‘trade collection' in illustration of the commerce of the country.
“Lastly, the building might contain a gallery of design, for the ºromotion of taste
among manufacturers and the public; and lecture-rooms and museams, which would
rolieve the already overcrowded state of many of our greatest scientific institutions.”
Oh, people! ... Your winter garden—that may be—is threatened
Your fountains dried up! Your statuary—that great silent teacher of
the grand and beautiful—refused - -
Your lecture-rooms and museums—that may be—sacrificed to a mob
of the idle and the particularly select!
People of England! law-lords are arming for the First of May.
Dowagers will take the field–exclusive lordlings gallop to the
demolition.
People of England, swear yourselves in to yourselves as special
constables to preserve this Crystal Palace, and defeat the Destructives
if the First of May !
An Old Saying pulled to Pieces.
... We have it on the authority of an old saying, that there is “wisdom
in a wig;", but a young lady, who has been two or three times to the
Ladies' Gallery in the House, declares, that, “though she has always
paid the greatest attention, she never could see the least “wisdom
in a Whig,” or in a Tory either.”

THE ASTRONOMY OF THE STAGE.
The Astronomy of the Stage often presents phenomena which
would startle even the indefatigable gentleman who seems to pass his
life in sitting up all night at Bermondsey, and despatching from that
most anti-celestial address the result of his observations in the form of
letters to the Times newspaper. We do not mean to underrate the
value or importance of this gentleman's series of nocturnal games at
stare-cap with the moon and stars; but, on the contrary, we appreciate
with thankfulness every new announcement of some nebulous speck
which has never before been seen, or of some peculiar affection of the
adjacent weathercocks which leads to the inference that there is some
unusual disturbance of the sky blue, or the º way, or the electric
currents. We, however, think the Astronomy of the Stage would, if
accurately noted and reported, furnish that wholesome mystification
to the savant which seems necessary to fit him for the task of public
enlightenment. In the Astronomy of the Stage we do not include that
annually increasing family of stars which our old friend, MR.C.ADAMs,
brings out of his packing-case for exhibition at the Adelphi, during
Passion Week, and which, in the present year, enabled him to
announce no less than
22 ADDITIONAL PLANETS.
If the progress of discovery continues at its recent rate, and MR
ADAMs still proceeds–
“On Orreries' heads Orreries tº accumulate,”
we shall know of no parallel to his number of additional planets, but the
so many “thousand additional lamps” at Vauxhall, on a gala night.
Excluding MR. ADAMs and his collection of “pretty little twinkling
stars” from the more vulgar astronomy of the stage, let us look at the
moon as it rose the other night, “round as my shield”—or, rather, as
my hoop, for shields are no longer worn—in Guglielmo, Tell, at the
Royal Italian Opera. The moon rose majestically over the dramatic
mountain tops, at about its ordinary rate; but ºf reached a certain
point, the conceited luminary stopped to admire itself in the lake below,
and would proceed not an inch farther during the remainder of a very
long act, though it had been travelling, for the previous few minutes,
with at least its usual rapidity. - -
Though the conduct of the moon was not consistent with the rules
of Astronomy in this instance, yet, on the whole, it was a well-conducted
moon; for we have known theatrical moons that have never moved
at all, and have exhibited a flickering light, and have sometimes been
even snuffed out, leaving a dull white orb apparent, until the re-illu-
mination has been attended to. As to the moon in Guglielmo. Tell, it
was an excellent moon as far as it went—our only objection being that
it did not go far enough, but pulled up for the night before the com-
pletion of one-fourth'of its naturally appointed journey. it been
the sun, we should have endeavoured to find an excuse in allegory, and
we might have presumed that the horses of the chariot of the sun had
suddenly knocked up; but for Luna we can see no reasonable apology.
It was, however, fortunate, on the whole, that the moon was not pre-
ed to continue her natural course; for, had she proceeded, she must

In MR. Forsyth's excellent work, A History of Trial, by Jury, he

of these was a rule that the presiding officer should sit cross-legged,

that he should sit “like a grim-looking lion, with the right foot crossed
over the left.” -
Englishmen have improved upon all this. Only take as an instance

dancing, no ices, no supper, no bon-bons, and no flirting at them—and
i. cannot possibly imagine how any party can go off well without
them.”

He expects to make quite a hit next year, with some old subjects—
in a new dress. He gilds the skies, counts the blades of grass and the
pebbles—shaves the shepherd boys' heads, and adds a yard to their
smocks, clips the trees, and dams the water. When dry enough, they
are to be framed ‘selon les régles,” and named ‘Legends.”

“I was sadly afraid when he chose the subject, that we should have

been caught by the
tempting announce-
ment,
A BEAUTIFUL HEAD

FOR ONE SHILLINC.
There is something
startling in the idea
of “A Shilling Head

gests the phenomenon
of a wig for twelve
Queen's Heads, or
Postage Stamps. On
reading a little fur-
ther, we make the
discovery that these
Beautiful Heads of
Hair are sold by the bottle, and consist of a specific for pre-
venting the hair from turning grey; an invention which, we are told
is “Invaluable in the Nursery.” We have seen babies with bal
heads; but a grey-haired infant is a curiosity quite worthy of
the experimentalist, who offers, to protect the inmates of a nursery
from hoary locks for one shilling. The same spirited individual
proffers to the public “pearly teeth at eighteen-pence a pot,” and
"balmy breath,” “free, for twenty postage stamps.” As to our.
selves, we patronise none of these things; but if we resort to any
expedient for preserving the few remaining patches of stubble on our
poor old head, we shall try the effect of mixing with our own thin
remnants of hair a few of CHUBB's Patent Safety Locks.
“TO BE SOLD IMMEDIATELY-THE CRYSTAL PALACE | *
We have already prepared our readers for this otherwise startling
announcement. A fortnight since we warned them of their favourite's

distant. And we have now to tell them that the fatal day is fixed, and
the name of the appointed CALCRAFT officially announced.
By Special Penny-a-Liner we are informed that a É. of gigantic

eaded with the Royal Arms, and stating with a brutal matter-of-

To Sell by Auction, on the Premises,

The words “Royal Commission” we take to be a misprint for
“Commissioners of Works:" for we cannot, believe the former Body
to be capable of anything half so foolish as the wanton destruction of
the only National Building that an Englishman is not ashamed of
owning. The choice of an Auctioneer as their destroying agent, is a
bit of sagacious policy well worthy of the º party. It bears a
logical significance, quite on a par with their other reasoning. . For
what more convincing proof of “the instability and weakness of the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LECTURE AT THE STRONG-MINDED WOMEN'S CLUB.
HE STRONG-MINDED WomEN held another meetin
last Wednesday, in Mrs. MAJoR WRight's .#
drawing-room, in A– Square.
Cards had been issued for seven o'clock, and at
gº a quarter past, the room was so crowded
at there was scarcely a footstool unoccupied.
On the sofas we observed some of the strongest-
minded women in the world, whose opinions have
created not less disturbance in England than in
America. To mention their names would only occupy space.
Tea was brought in at half-past seven, an
discussion immediately ensued upon the prevailing follies of
the day. These were lashed in the severest manner, and the
disgraceful scandal of ladies not, more generally adopting the
Bloomer costume (some beautiful prints of which were scat-
tered about the room) was commented upon with the usual
bitterness.
It was then moved by Mrs. MAJoR WRIGHT, and seconded
by Miss ARABELLA PANTILETTEs, that MRs. Lucius CREACHER
do take the chair, which was carried with the greatest unani-
º of pºcket-handkerchiefs.
Rs. Lucius CREACHER, after removing her spectacles,
began by requesting that “ChBISTOPHER, the Page, do leave
the room.”
As soon as this order had been complied with, MRs. LUCIUs
CREAgher, brushing her hair back off her forehead, proceeded
to address the meeting thus:-
“LADIes—THE SUBJECT of our LECTURE. This Evening, Is SMOKING !!!
“Of all selfish, degrading, injurious, deleterigus, abasing vices—for it is more than a fault, it is a
positive vice—there is none equal to that of Smoking! I do not hesitate to say that the man who
smokes is lost. How different does his whole mature become, when once he has taken a cigar in his
hand! I really believe that the root of all matrimonial differences is the tobacco-plant. If not the
root exactly, at all events it is a most prolific branch. (Clattering of tea-spºons). Lºok at the same
man before he has smoked, and after he has smoked. It is a well-known painful truth that the bloom of
health cannot stand before the withering effect of tobacco-smoke., . It, turns the rosy carnation, of
Beauty into the pale ash-colour of Disease, as if the cheek it had blighted had become impregnated
with He material itself during the process of consumption.

“But it is not only the destruction to their health and their morals, ladies-it is not merel
sanitary or in an ethical point of view that we must look at this mighty question of Smoking,
is also in a pecuniary light—though, in connexion with smoking, I detest the very mention of the word
* Light.” Smoking is not only a highly injurious habit, but it is likewise an ex ingly expensive one,
and, for that reason alone, I would have every ounce of tobacco thrown, into the Thames. It is an
extravagance—and an extrayagance, which, let a man's necessities be what they will, is never sup-
pressed. It is the very last luxury which a man denies himself, and I have known men, whose wives,
a most animated
to my knowledge, hadn't had a new
bonnet for a whole twelvemonth, still
coolly perseyere, in spending their six-
R. or their shillinga-day in smoking.
ow, a shilling a-day is 365 shillings
a-year—no less a sum than £18 5s.-
(cries of ‘Dear me / ) . Now, if this
sum of £185s. was put by every year,
they would have for it a very respect-
able Cashmere shawl, which they might
resent to their wives on their birth-
ays—but, no! catch them doing it.
| Such is the ingrained selfishness of
Man, that I really believe he would
prefer his pipe of tobacco to the hand-
somest Cashmere that ever came from
the looms of India (profound sensation).
“But it is not only the expense of
smoking; there is another expense
connected with it. The vices of smo-
king and drinking generally go hand-
in-hand together; for you may put it
down almost as an invariable rule. that
the man who has a cigar in one hand,
holds a tumbler in the other. It
would seem that tobacco was a plant
that would not flourish unless plenti-
fully watered with what is called Grog.
I know that my husband—who, when
|I married him, wouldn't touch any-
|||}|{ stronger than elder wine—will
drink now of an evening as many
glasses of grog as he smokes pipes;
and he would sometimes have more, if
I didn't take the key of the cellaret
up-stairs with me to bed (fashionable
| laughter).
| “I think I have satisfactorily proved
the injury that arises from this baneful
habit; but there is a greater injury
still, that remains to be explained. It
is the injury it does to the furniture,
and every one's clothes. Whose cur-
tains are safe? whose carpet is re;
spected, when once a man is allowed
to smoke in the house? As for com-
fort, it flies out of the window directly
you open it to let the smoke out; and
you have but two alternatives—either
to sit still, and be suffocated; or to
sit in a draught, and be chilled to death
—and I hardly know which is worse.
“And if you remonstrate—if you
declare you will not put up with this
disgraceful state of things, which
. it difficult for you to find a
room the next morning in which you
can breakfast with comfort—theremedy
is almost worse than the disease. You
drive your husband elsewhere to enjoy
his pipe—though what enjoyment it
can be to him, I cannot make out.
He goes to his club, or to the nearest
hotel or public-house, to smoke with
other smokers as bad as himself; and
if you are wise, you had better not
inquire what hour it is when he re-
turns home!
“I sum up the evils of smoking to
be as follows: Lassitude, great ex-
pense, drunkenness, injury to one's
clothes, carpets, and curtains—depar.
ture of everything like comfort–
headaches, latch-keys, late hours, and
total wreck of everything like do-
mestic happiness!, (su d groans.)
|Évils, ladies, most awful to contem-
plate; and which it behoves us, as
strong-minded women, to combat as
much as lies in our power.
“What the enjoyment of smoking
can be, baffles my wildest imagination;
but, as it is the object of our society
to investigate everything that may be
'attended with anything like a bene-

ficial result for the Regeneration of Man, I have brought a cigar
with me,, purposely to smoke it, in order to know what the feeling
may be like. "I now move for your permission, ladies, to try the
experiment.” - - - -
This being speedily granted, a light was brought, and the intrepidlec-
turer began, in the most heroic manner, to whiff the cigar, which she de-
scribed as being sold to her “as a full-flavoured Cuba.” She represented
the effects as being of a most nauseous description, and was proceeding
most warmly to explain her sensations under the existing experiment,
when, from some unexplained cause, she came to a sudden stop, and,
turning very pale, sank down upon her chair.
At this point, a gurgling sound of suppressed laughter was heard,
and, the door being thrown open, CHRISTOPHER, the Page, was dis-
covered to be ...i. listening at the key-hole. His ears were severely
pulled by every one present, and the meeting abruptly broke up in a
state of the most talkative excitement.
Thus ended the Lecture, by the Strong-Minded Women's Club, upon
Smoking, with no other result than MRs. CREACHER being carried
up to bed, very ill, by four Strong-Minded Women.

Hard Swearing in France.
A. Most startling article appeared last week, in the Times: it was a
:::::::: of the various oaths taken by French statesmen and French
officials, from the time of the Consulate to the time of the last oath
proposed by the President;-oaths of all colours, and all as seriously
carved as the patches of harlequin's jacket. The President has, of
course, his own notion of an oath—that is, of an oath sworn by himself.
When a Chinaman is sworn, he breaks a saucer. When a Louis
NAPOLEoN swears, nothing is broken except—the oath.
THE GREAT PRIMA DONNA QUESTION.
SINCE the departure from among us of the Swedish Nightingale
there has been no excitement in musical circles to equal that occasioned
by the rumoured appearance of the Mitcham "Lark,” who is now
formally announced as being “exclusively” engaged at no less than
seven suburban tea-gardens. From exclusive sources of information,
We are enabled to furnish, the following interesting particulars. The
Lark,” who is a native of Mitcham, first attracted the attention of the
beadle, who had overheard her youthful warblings through an open
window, and by whose introduction she became a member of a local
singing-class. Having been induced to take a short solo in the MS.
§. of a professor, known—to his family and a few friends—as
the Brompton BEETHoveN, the “Lark” was favourably noticed by the
Drum of a military band who happened to be present on the occasion.
At the suggestion of the Drum, the friends of the “Lark” articled her
for three years to a tea-garden Flute, at whose benefit she at length
appeared, when she took all the tea-tables by storm, in “I’d be a
Butterfly,” which she gave in character, with practicable wings and a
real “bower.”
From this moment her career was one of uninterrupted triumph, to
the enjoyment of which a hopeless passion for a popular “Bones,”
whom she had met professionally among a party of Ethiopian Serenaders,
was the only drawback. Some say that she was never justified in
fostering this unhappy attachment; while others aver with equal
confidence that the gentleman was devoid of feeling, and that his
heart was so º * up in his “bones” as to be hard and
insensible towards any tender influence. The attachment of the
“Lark” to the wayward Ethiopian has, however, given a dark
complexion to her otherwise brilliant career; and, though many have
wondered at, an infatuation exhibited thus perseveringly towards an
unworthy object—and such an object as an Ethiopian Serenader
necessarily makes himself—it is the excuse of the “Dark” that, like
Desdemona, she “saw his visage in his bones.”
Blighted in her earliest affections—which had all the gushing, but
none of the ripeness, of the gooseberry—she transferred her love exclu-
sively to her art; and created immense sensation by her “Poor Mary
Anne!” which was got up expressly for her, with a “real willow,” at
the Royal Twankey Tea Gardens, in the neighbourhood of one of our
large manufacturing towns. Her fame having reached London, the
Manager of one of our Metropolitan Music Halls hastened to secure her
services on her own terms, which included the deposit of her railway
fare to London; but, unfortunately, nothing was said about, the class
by which she was to travel. This point remaining indefinite, the matter
came to the ears of the energetic impresario º one of our suburban
Saloons, who immediately sent down a first-class ticket for the “Lark,”
by which he is supposed to have secured her “exclusive” services. To
d to the complication of affairs, it seems that part of the stipulated
contract, with the “Lark,” was the promised engagement of the
“Bones,” already alluded to—which induced the Manager of a favourite
Temple of Apollo, at Chelsea, to strain every nerve and muscle to se-
cure the “Bones,” which he has succeeded in doing; and he now claims
to have also obtained the right to the “Lark’s” exclusive services.
A few days will, no doubt, determine the point at issue; but at
present the name of the Mitcham “Lark” stands at the head of so
many contradictory announcements, that we know not where we
ought to place our confidence.
Melancholy Intelligence.
DIED the other day, sincerely, execrated, the Income Tax. The
motto selected for its hatchment will (it is to be feared) be “Resurgam.”
The following lines may, in the meanwhile, be consecrated to its
memory:-
Affliction sore in me you bore,
Remonstrance was in vain!
And shortly I–though now no more–
Shall trouble you again.
An Extrawny Taste.
“MY DEAR PUNCH,-I am not partial to reading; but taking up
the paper just now, I saw that a MR. SEELEY, a bibliopoal—if that’s
how you spell it—says that “books are articles of luxury.’ I beg to
give the most unqualified contradiction to that statement.
“A GUARDsmAN, BUT NOT of THE BLUES.”
*P.S.. I am no bookworm.”
UNPARALLELED BOREs.
THE Gloucester Chronicle describes a singular phenomenon called the
“Severn Bore.” The Severn may have one remarkable bore, but that
is nothing to the crowded steam-boats and filthy water which are the
bores of the Thames.

The Father of the French Nation.
At the review of the troops in Paris, on Easter Sunday,
Louis NAPOLEoN–they write—was well received by his
soldiers; and “persons stationed here and there”—civi-
lians—"cried out, ' Wive le Père du Peuple!’” The
manner of the cry, it is added, showed it was a cry to order.
*Long live the Father of his People!” What, now, was
the amount of wages paid to the criers? Three–four-
or five francs a mouth P. Say, the highest sum : surely,
never did father suddenly have so º a family at so
small a cost. These “Fathers of the People,” however,
are apt to be very like Saturn, the first mythological father
of his people; and he was always filled with the paternal
desire of eating his children.

THE BRAZEN HEAD AT SUNDERLAND.
HERE are many dummies, the
, dummies of human flesh –
and let us be thankful for
their dumbness – in the
House of Commons. They
say, or rather walk-step-
ping out the monosyllables
into the lobby—“yes” or
“no,” and there an end.
Their constituencies, by
means of such potent words,
are supposed to declare, all
their wants, and to record all
their opinions. Very good.
A monosyllable is the nearest
of kinto silence—and silence,
or its next relative, is held
by certain ºpher. to
- be a profound thing.
Sunderland is represented; but not by a mere fleshly dummy.-No;
the material of the representative, is almost of eternal stuff. FRIAR
Bacon made his Brazen Head vocal with three sentences. The town
of Sunderland has its Brazen Head; and though it has remained silent
as the brass-knocker of a house in Chancery during the present session
of Parliament, it has º talked a bit in Sunderland; talked that it
may, at the next election, be again returned to show what gold with
brass may do.
The Brazen Head talks to its admiring constituents. The Brazen
Head enounces its opinions.
The Brazen Head thinks SIB JAMEs GRAHAM “an artful dodger.”
the Postman's.
The Brazen Head, with a most glittering smile, “thinks it ought to
know what a dodger is.”
The Brazen Head thinks the Corn Laws a hasty wrong, committed
upon the landed interest. And the Brazen Head has, “it should hope,
studied the º of wrong in all its branches.”
The Brazen Head would, nevertheless, not repeal the Corn Laws,
wrong as they may be.
The Brazen Head thinks the Ballot “un-English.” And the Brazen
Head has a particular knowledge of what is “un-English,” from its
multifarious dealings with other people’s “Spanish.”
The Brazen Head will vote only for a national education, “based on
the Bible!” The Brazen Head will continue to bow reverently towards
“our venerable establishment of the Church,” with all its present
glories of Bishops, and Deans, and Chapters. The Brazen Head will
not trust to the “voluntary system,” which many folks thought odd;
no Head, like unto the Brazen Head, having such experience of the
facility with which people sometimes part with their money. But, all
things, political and social, the Brazen Head will have “based on the
Bible!” The Bible before all things, and this is right. And when
the Brazen Head talked reverently of the Bible, it was observable that
its nostrils had dilated and expanded, and a brighter light shone
from the brass, as though it snuffed the savoury mess of pottage that
was “cooked” to deceive the patriarch.
Louis Napoleon's March.
. DURING a review by Louis NAPOLEoN, the other day, of two brigades
in the Place du Carrousel, it is said that a band continued playing,
: Partant pour la Syrie.” How long will it be ere the tune changes to
“Partant pour l’Angleterre '''-the words adapted to a certain march,
sometimes performed in the British Army by way of farewell, on the
part of his fellow soldiers, to a comrade, on the occasion of the regiment
depriving itself of the lonour of containing him.

NECROMANCY IN AMERICA.
EAPING across the Isthmus of
Panama is a mere joke to es-
tablishing a communication

latter triumph of enterprise
is, however, an American fact;
and there are persons in the

common a branch of industry
is that of these people, that,
in the compendious and busi-
ness-like language of the
nation, they are currently
called “mediums:” and here
is a story about some of
then., extracted from the
Transatlantic news of the
Morning Post:—
“The Spiritual Rappers have got

THE OMNIWOROUS CORPORATION.
J. B., in the Times, laments the carelessness
of the civic authorities in suffering the remains
of antiquity, such as the undercroft of Gerrard's
Hall, to be demolished and destroyed, and ex-
presses the fear that those .* persons will,
as certain corporate brethren of theirs, at a.
fashionable southern bathing-place, when solicited
to encourage an artistic exhibition, asked of
“pictors,” be ready to say, “What’s the use of
antiquities? You can't eat'em, and ycu can't
So drink 'em. What's the use of antiquities?”
But one would think that the Corporation of
London could eat antiquities. Its members are
famed for an ... digestion; and the
bronzes, arms, ornaments, and vessels, that are
dug up in London, disappear as rapidly as the
eatables at the Lord Mayor's feast. Time, that
consumes all things, especially relics, devours
less food altogether than the City.
Inaudible Sounds.
WE well remember being puzzled by a pam-
phlet we once saw, entitled, A Treatise on In-
audible Sounds. e know we stretched our
imagination to the utmost, but for the life of us
we could not, imagine the existence of an “in-
audible sound,” with the exception, perhaps, of
that of a codfish.
Time, however, and M. Louis NAPOLeon, have

Medio tufissimus ibis, we should say, is a maxim that does not hold good with regard to
any dependence on these Yankee mediums, miscalled Rappers, as they are clearly not worth
a rap; but another aphorism is exemplified by their very familiar spirits, whose familiarity
possessed by the said together helped to reconcile the anomaly. There
can be no question whatever now, that inaudible
sounds are the speeches in the French Senate.
The BEST HAND AT PIECE-WoRK.—Mox-
sIEUR Scribe.
THE BISHOP OF MANCHESTER'S EASTER OFFERING.
The Bishop of MANCHESTER dimed with the LoRD MAYOR on
Easter Monday, and in courteous return, for turtle, made a speech;
and in this His GRACE had a decided advantage over the EARL of
DERBY, who, upon the health of Her MAJEsty's Ministers bein
given, adroitly enough talked away, and made no speech at all. An
this circumstance suggests, to us the necessity of the Corporation
“keeping a poet,” that the bard may furnish Ministers with songs for
certain occasions, where speeches, in the real sense of the word, are
not to be spoken. The EARL of DERBY is said to possess an excellent
tenor voice, and might have trolled off some pretty nonsense verses to
the tune of Corn Rigs are Bonny, or Meet me when the Bloom is on the
Rye. This, however, for the future.
The BISHOP’s .*.*. given over the festal mahogany—was
not of vain and carnal things, but of education—a subject, at the time,
no doubt, of exceeding interest to the noblemen, members of the Cor.
poration, and citizens thereunto listening. such a theme over , City
dessert must have been even as “apples of silver in platters of gold”
-very beautiful, if none of it eatable. The Bishop fººl, avowed
that he owed his education to the City of London, and, “in the position
where it was now his lot to be placed, he had endeavoured, and he
trusted not without success, to transplant some goodly saplings from
the oak of the London educational institutions.”
The oak of education,--and in London . The “London Oak!” Isis
fº sign. There was, we know, the “Cocoa Tree;” and there is still
the “Flower Pot; ” but we never heard of the “London Oak.” But we
detect the error at once—it is, a mistake, a blunder of the reporters.
And thus our intelligence enables us to anticipate the courteous note
that the Bishop of MANCHESTER would otherwise write to Punch, in
these words:
“The Bishop of MANCHEstER presents his compliments to Mr.
Punch, and begs of him, as Corrector-General and Critic-Universal, to
amend an error of the press in a report of the Bishop's speech at the
Mansion House on Easter Monday. The Bishop is made to speak of
the oak of the London educational institutions! The blunder will be
self-evident to every intelligent mind; nevertheless, the Bishop desires
the insertion of the following erratum : for ‘oAK,” read “Hoax ' ' "
The error, after a little consideration, is evident; nevertheless, it is
only due to the Bishop, as a Bishop, that he, should set himself right
with the world. We have quite sufficient of the comprehensive British
Oak, without any. Additional, London Qak. ...Again, oaks have not
hitherto been associated with the instruction of youth,<-but trees with
*—
twigs more flexible. The “oak” of education! Why, the late debates
upon education in the House of Commons, where sectarian squabbles
with sectarian, so that whilst law-makers disagree, children morally
pine—the whole, course of the wrangle shows the Bishop could not
mean “oak.” No: the House of Commons itself cries—“HoAx!—
HoAx!”
A TYBURNIAN OF THE OLD SCHOOL.
S a general rule, every
man to his taste.
There is, how-
ever, a sort of bad
taste that may be
called too
Here is an ex-
ample both of the
rule and the ex-
ception:-
“I do hope Lonn
John MANNERs will
be firm, and not give
in to the threats cf
unpopularity from
scribblers in the
Times and others.
Let him do his duty
to the Park, fear-
lessly and firmly, as
Lohd SEwMoUR did
before him, and not sacrifice the quiet inhabitants of this neighbourhood to the interested
views of Messks. PAxtox AND Co.”
This is a paragraph extracted from a letter in the Morning Post,
signed “A TYBURNIAN,” urging the demolition of the Crystal Palace.
The Tyburnian gentleman has, of course, a perfect right to entertain
and express whatever opinion he likes on that subject. But he rather
exceeds the limits of propriety in imputing interested motives to the
architect of the Crystal Palace, if ; means to include him in his
imaginary firm of PAxton AND Co. Indeed, the Tyburnian's epistle
may be said to be so far scurrilous, and perhaps even to merit for its
author the appellation of “scribbler,”—a word defined by DR.
Johnson to mean “a petty author; a writer without worth.” Such
a letter may be considered worthy of an inhabitant of Tyburnia, in
days when Tyburnia rejoiced in the Tyburn Tree.

THE VOICE OF THE PROTECTION IST.S.
E announce another
miracle! An ass has
spoken for Protec-
tion . After Chow-
LER comes HEE-
HAw. The wonder
was manifested at
Bury, in lancashire,
during the elec:
tioneering visit of
MR. F. PEEL. The
Honourable Gentle-
man purposed to ad-
dress the electors
at the Town Hall:
it was crammed;
and, it seems, very
many were the disap-
pointed . Protection-
ists outside. Never-
“The instinct of the multitude is ever right,”
theless, they would be heard. - - -
says LAMARTINE, and so it proved with the multitude of Protectionists without;
for, not being able to be heard themselves, they chose as mouthpiece for their
combined arguments and aspirations, a-full-grown donkey.
The reporter writes of the excluded—“They put the climax to the annoyance,
by bringing a donkey under the windows, who discoursed most eloquent, but
certainly not harmonious, music. MR. PEEL appeared to enjoy the joke.” And
MR. PEEL was very right.
After awhile the proceedings began, MR. PEEL delivering his opinions upon the
Corn Laws. “He believed them to have worked admirably for the country.”
“Hee-haw'” cried the Donkey.
“They had given food to millions.”
“Hee-haw | * --- - - -
E º had produced a condition of prosperity, unparalleled in the history of
ngland.”
“Hee-haw 1–hee-haw l’”
“And the people of England would never again consent to eat a dear loaf when
they could get a cheap one, that landlords might screw high rents from the
cupboards of the country.”
“Hee-haw hee-haw hee-haw l’”
The replies of the donkey were given with considerable emphasis, but it was
the general feeling that his arguments were in no manner different from those
of Messrs. Chowler and party.
However, at all times it is delightful to chronicle the gratitude of nations and
§º. rare is its development. The eloquent ass of Bury has been purchased
y a distinguished ducal Protectionist; and, turned into a paddock, will, for the
remainder of his days—without working for it—crop the sweetest of English
grass, and eat the very best of English icº.
An ill-natured free-trader has—in the savageness of his soul—likened this easy
condition of the eloquent and certainly not over-rewarded donkey to that of the
Corn-Law Landlord, –All clover, and no care!
CONVERTS IN BUCKRAM.
FALSTAFF's arithmetical abilities, as exercised on the
“men in buckram,” appear to have been greatly exceeded
by the addition and multiplication of one WILBERForce,
son to a respectable man of that name, but now Secretary to
a Papist Association for swamping the House of Commons
with Members for Rome. This individual's cleverness at
jº. has been evinced in his estimate of the number
of persons who have turned Roman Catholics at Rugby;
but the Rev. Messrs. MoULTRIE and PAGE have shown
that in the figures of WILBERFoRce, the most remarkable
is the figure hyperbole. It is very curious that not only
do the theological dogmas of WILBERFoRch’s persuasion
require the exertion of great faith to be believed; but
the same demand is also very commonly made by the per-
sonal statements of its advocates. The process of inquiry
would seem to be hardly more damaging to the pretensions
of the Popish priesthood at large, than it is to the claim of
certain disciples of theirs to credit. The character as well
as the number of WILBERForce's converts appears, on
investigation, to be somewhat different from j; it had
been represented by him. With respect to one of them,
at least, MR. PAGE, after intimating that he was not a
gentleman of very strong Anglican convictions, observes—
“Indeed, he had successively belonged to the various places of worship
in the town, and only a short time before his becoming a Romanist, he
complained to me of not being sufficiently supported in his business as a
jobbing tailor by my congregation.”
According to WILBERForce, sacrifices of cynsiderable
severity were made by many of the Rugby seceders. It
is much to be apprehended, that these oblations were
pretty nearly on a par with the alarming sacrifice, of this
tailor, and with the sacrifices, equally alarming, which some
linendrapers are in the habit of making. The jobbing
tailor seemed to have had his business in view, when he
changed his profession. , Perhaps he may not find that step
|.”. so good a job as he expected; and discovering that
he has not obtained one coat the more to mend by turning
his own, may by-and-by be heard moralising somewhat in
the following strain; “Blow this here Popery'. I ain't
no better off for having forsook my religion; and now, as
the l{oman candlesticks won't do nufſen for me, I shall jine
a coffin-club.”
So much for the tailor's sacrifice. Some “converts”
sacrifice more. When they resort to exaggeration and
mis-statement, they sacrifice truth; when, moreover, bear-
ing an honourable name, they yield themselves to the tools
of a set of seditious fanatics, they sacrifice reputation.
SoMETHING to be THANKFUL roR.—LoRD DERby is not

GOLDEN (SQUARE) AND SILVER (STREET) MINING
COMPANY.
The promoters of this truly promising scheme beg to inform the
public that they are already in possession of a PLOT, the foundation of
which is Deep LAID, and which they hope will prove to be of a most
productive character. There can be no doubt that Golden Square
derives its name from the quantity of precious metal that has found its
way to the locality, which, from its having been always the residence of
lawyers, has no doubt become the receptacle of all the auriferous streams
that have flowed in from a countless number of channels. It is proposed
to purchase the ground in the enclosure, where there are already several
plants, and the set is most extensive, on account of the set that has
always been made by the inhabitants on the gold of the community.
Though the yield has not been equal to former years, it is believed that
the workings may still be made profitable; and, indeed, it is confidently
stated that, in addition to the *:::::::::: of the Square, Pewter
may be quickly developed, for a considerable quantity of Quartz and
. less §: six Pints were picked up in one morning by the Square-
eeper.
i. promoters have also the happiness to state that, however rich
the veins, they will be thoroughly drained; for bleeding is a process
to which the genius loci is peculiarly adapted—lawyers and surgeons
having been the º inhabitants. -
Should the Gold of Golden Square be ever exhausted, it is proposed
to develop the Silver of Silver Street; and 20,000 additional shares at
5s. per share will be issued simultaneously with the 50,000 at £1 each,
for which the earliest applicants will have the preference. . .
The ground has been already surveyed, and the plans laid down, by
OBADIAH SLEEky, the Captain of the Great Wheel-Barrow Mine, and
\ºf Director of the Wheel-about and Turn-about Tin and
Tinfoil Miners of the Land's End districts. Specimens may be seen
(by those who have already paid for their shares) at the Office of the
Company, where a prize-fighter will be in attendance, to answer all
questions and show his metal.
Directors have been already appointed, with power to take in as
many as may be required. Dividends will be paid by drafts—on the
pump-of which due notice will be given.

THE BONES OF THE BEST AUTHORS.
THERE can be little doubt that OLIVER CROMwell was descended from BRIAREUs; for
the Protector has left at least a dozen skulls behind him. Skulls of all sizes have been
roduced; among them, OLIVER's skull, when a little boy—when a youth–and when Lord
rotector; and all, no doubt, equally genuine. And this extraordinary circumstance–recently
brought to light by persevering antiquaries moiling in that valuable, print, Notes and Queries
—results from the fact, that when Oliver had his hair cut, the head itself was generally
sent; and in some cases never returned. We have now, however, another relic preserved
in the “rib-bone” of MILTON | It appears that the Poet's bones were "clandestinely
distributed.” Upon this a Note and Query contributor writes:–
“One fell to the lot of an old and esteemed friend, and between forty-five and forty years ago, at his house,
not many miles from London, I have often examined the said rib-bone. That friend is long since dead; but his
son, now in the vale of years, lives, and I doubt not, from the reverence felt to the great author of ‘Paradise Lost,'
that he has religiously preserved the precious relic.”
The writer smugly continues:–
“It might not be agreeable to him to have his name published; but from his tastes, ;I.; a person of some
distinction in literary pursuits—is likely to be a reader of ‘Notes and Queries, and if this should catch his eye, he
may be induced to send you some particulars.”
..We would advise the reverential admirer of John Milton, who holds his rib-bone, to hold

shudder at the thought of pawing, the bones of Milton; but no-there is a kind of morbid
admiration administered to by such relics, even as the dram-drinker is excited by his gin,
Were these bone-grubbers discoverable, and
were Punch made despot for the nonce,—very
salutary would be the punishment he would
inflict upon them.
For instance, the possessor of MILTON's rib-
bone is brought up for judgment, and Punch
passes sentence:- -
"Miserable, morbid, unimaginative, demo-
ralised bone-grubber 1 The sentence of the
Court is, that you immediately give orders for
the funeral of the rib-bone of JóHN MILTON, that
it should be resolved into its kindred earth; and,
as punishment for having so long defrauded the
earth of its due, you are ordered to provide a
handsome oaken coffin to receive the aforesaid
rib-a coffin covered with purple velvet, and
ornamented with silver-gilt nails. And not less
than six º: coaches, filled with policemen
clothed in plain black, at your expense, for the
mournful occasion, shall accompany the said
hearse: and the rib being consigned to the earth,
the undertaker's bill, without one penny dis-
count, shall be immediately paid.”
We foresee what the fashion will lead to. If
the ribs and articulations of men of genius are to
be thus sought for and treasured, Albums will
soon go out. Hence, young ladies, instead of
asking, autographs, and poems, and sketches,
for their volumes, would in the prettiest manner,
beg of the favoured sons of genius to leave at
their death, as a precious relic, “just the smallest
little joint, for their little love of a bone-house.”

THE GREAT DIPLOMATIC FIDDLE-CASE.
[An Unreported Debate.]
EARL FITZRQBERT-seeing the Noble Lord, the Minister for Foreign
Affairs, in his place—was desirous of learning whether he had received
from the Court of Vienna any diplomatic despatches relative to the
great, musical mass, recently Fº in the Cathedral of Prague,
for the repose of the soul of the late PRINCE SchwARTZENBERG ;
the first fiddle at the said mass having been played by the British
Ambassador?
. The EARL OF MARMALADE said he had as yet received no official
intelligence of what he must consider a most gratifying circumstance
(ironical cheers from the opposition)—he .# repeat the phrase,
ſº circumstance; as it proved in the most satisfactory, he
might add, harmonious manner–that the relations for awhile dis-
cordantly suspended between this country and Austria, had been
restored by the first fiddle of the British Ambassador. That fiddle had
achieved a European reputation for the purity of its tone, and the
energy of its bowing. -
LoRD BRUFPAM-Does the Noble Earl mean to say, that he gas
heard nothing of the extraordinary performances of the British
Ambassador in the Cathedral of Prague }
The EARL of MARMALADE made no such assertion. What he said
was—he had received no official intelligence of the matter. He had,
certainly, in his place at the Opera, taken part in a mixed conversation
relative to the merits of MADEMoiselle WAGNER and the EARL of
WESTMQRELAND: and he should, perhaps, not be out of order if he ob-
served, it had then and there been suggested that, should MR.LUMLEY
be jilted by the prima donna, he might at the worst make a stop-gap of
the noble Earl representing HER MAJESTY at the Court of Vienna.
LoRD BRUFFAM.–Will the noble Earl inform the House if it is his
intention to address the Ambassador on what he (LORD B.) must con-
sider a most vital question? The country would not rest satisfied with
vague generalities. The country would know the particular music
executed by the noble cat-gut Ambassador—(a laugh)—the time he kept
—whether he played upon four strings, or two; with a full account of
the stoccata passages, if any, and how and where delivered.
The DUKE or DITCHPoND thought the country had every right, to
congratulate itself upon being represented at so musical a Court as that
of Vienna, by a nobleman who—had it pleased destiny to have called
him to that station—might have rivalled a Costa, a MoRI, or a
PAGANINI. Happy was it for this º and Austria, so recently set
together by the ears by the captious, and he would add the democratic,
meddling of a late Minister—happy, he would say, was it for England that
she possessed an Ambassador, who, like ORPHEUs of old, would, by the
ravishment of his strains, turn the very heart of a Russian bear into a ball
of honey, and—(here the noble Duke, #; his voice, became inaudible.)
..The EARL of GABERDEEN-as the consistent advocate of religious
liberty—must express his satisfaction that the noble Earl at Vienna
had so “improved” a mournful occasion as to make it a matter of
renewed amity between both countries. The lamented PRINCE
SchwartzENBERG died a Catholic; the mass executed for the º:
of his soul was according to the rite of the Catholic Church; and he
(the noble Earl) could not, in his mind's eye, behold A. British Ambas-
sador in the venerable Cathedral of Prague, amidst cardinals, and swing:
ing censers, and clouds of incense, and all the gorgeous paraphernalia of
the Catholic Church; he could not, without the deepest satisfaction, con:
template the noble Earl fiddling, and above the other instruments, and
above the chanting, making heard the silveriness of that fiddle-as the
best type and representative of that gentle, harmoniºus, and improved
foreign policy, that—since the accession of the noble Earſ to power—had
been manifested between the two coustries. - - -
Iond BRUFFAM—As the noble Earl was so delighted with the pacific
fiddling of one Ambassador, perhaps—should he again be called to the
councils of his country—he would pick the plenipotentiaries for all
foreign Courts from the orchestra of the Opera. He (LoRD B.), thought
the big drum, the pandeans, and even the bagpipe, might at various
Courts represent—
The MARQUIs of
before the House. - - -
Lond BRUFFAM (with much warmth).-Then I will make a motion.
And I move accordingly for “a copy of the music executed upon the
fiddle at the mass and funeral of PRINCE SchwantzenBERG by the
British Ambassador; and, further, for the production of the fiddle
itself; and, further, for the attendance of a professiºnal fiddler to play
before the House the composition of the noble Earl representing Her
Britannic Majesty at the Court of Vienna; and at Prague fiddling in
his official capacity for the repose of, the soul of the late PRINCE
SchwartzENBERG of odorous memory.”
Ordered.—Their Lordships then adjourned.
“THEODORE HOOK” ON THE CORN LAWS.
The Herald, in a profound article on the scarcity of bread and
present general famine produced by the repeal of the Corn Laws,
quotes HooD's “Song of the Shirt;” saying,
a “Oh God!' wrote Theodore Hook, in his unrivalled picture of the misery of
ill-requited indus -
q try, “That human flesh should be so cheap
And bread should be so dear!”
How fearfully ‘cheap' must free trade have made human flesh, when the cheapening
of bread has not placed a single ounce of food additional within reach of our working
classes!"

DESIGN FOR A BAS-RELIEF TO BE DEDICATED TO THE OLD WOMEN OF ENGLAND.
NUNS NON-SUCHES.
URING the past week
MR. Knox is reported
to have presented, in
the House of Commons,
a petition from five
hundred ladies of the
parish of Errigle, and
from two hundred and
twenty-five ladies of
Fivemiletown, both in
the county of Tyrone,
for the inspection of
nunneries. Lamentable
bigotry and intolerance
this — is it not, my
brothers of the Ora-
tory?... Wherefore a
visitation of a convent,
but to see if there is
anything wrong there?
As if that were pos-
sible! Asif friars were
men, and nuns women
—in such a sense as to
be peccable. As if
abuses had ever crept
into any monastic insti-
tution; as if cruelty,
oppression, intimida-
tion, had ever been, or
ever could be, practised
within its holy walls.
In short, as if all abbots and abbesses were not to be, and could not be, trusted implicitly, not
only with the morals, but with the cleanliness, health, comfort, and entire direction of the
secret societies under their control. Because, to be sure, if it were really true that the
superiors of abbeys and nunneries were liable to the same passions and infirmities of temper
with-for example-conductors of lunatic asylums, there would be the same reason why the
law should provide for the inspection of converts, as there is for its enforcing the visitation
of madhouses—you see, my brothers. -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PARLIAMENTARY PASS-TIME.
| AS the object of the House of
ommons seems to
be to fill up as much
time as possible in
Motions by which
nothing moves, and
in proposing Mea-
sures which termi-
nate always in mea-
sures of º; but
space—we beg leave
to suggest a few
Notices that may be
put upon the paper,
with all the effect
which the parties
seem to have in
view ; namely, the
useless prolongation
of the Session.
MR. CHRISTY: To
ask for a return of
the number of inha-
bitants of Vancou-
ver's Island, distin-
ishing the immediate descendants of WANcouver from the rest of the
atives; and also to inquire if there will be any objection to the pro-
duetion of a list of those engaged in the Mineral Trade, distinguishing
the Miners from those of mature age.
MR. Anstey : On the Motion of the President of the Board of
Centrol, relative to the Government of India—to move, by way of
amendment, the addition of the following words:—
“That it be an instruction to any Committee which may be appointed
upon any subject whatever, to include any other subject whatever; and
that all British subjects in India may be relieved, as far as, possible,
from all improper burdens to which they may appear to be subjected.”
CoLoRELTHOMPson: To move, in a Committe of Supply,
1. That one and one make two. - -
2. That f: faith ought to be kept with the National Creditor.
3. That homesty is the best policy. -
4. That it is not the interest of the community to defraud the
Fundholder. who would in fact have no funds to hold if he
were so defrauded.
LoRD DUDLEY STUART: To move for copies or extracts of all
documents relating to Kiutayah up to the present time.
MR. URQUHART: To move for copies of all the correspondence that
has taken place between the Ameers of Ararat and the Nabob, on the
subject of the debts of the latter; with copies of all writs that may or
may not have been served upon him during the last thirty years.
MR. WILLIAMs: In Committee on General Board of Health Bill,
to #. whether Welchpool is dried up; and whether Hockley in
the Hole, being situated in a hollow, it would not be, on the whole,
better for Hockley that the hole should be filled up.
MR. DRUMMOND: To inquire of the Home Secretary, in reference
to the National Land Scheme, whether, he has thought proper to give
directions for any inquest to be holden in consequence of SNIG's
melancholy end.

WHAT WILL THE DUKE OF BEAUFORT SAY 2
HER MAJESTY-contemptuous of the example of the DUKE of
BEAUFORT, who recently had certain of his tenants so well disciplined
for the return of his son for Worcester—HER MAJESTY has issued her
commands to the tradesmen of the Castle, that at the approaching
election they shall do what they like with their own votes!
The royal butcher stands upon his own leg! The royal poulterer
Crows “GRENFELL!” or “REID" and the royal butterman—vindi-
cating the liberty of an unbiassed, unbought Englishman—throws his
hº egg at either candidate 1 ..
Well, we must repeat the question—“What will the DUKE OF
BEAUFORT say?”
New Similes—"As Deaf as the House of Lords."
WE continually read in the papers of the House of Lords, of causes
and appeals “set down for hearing.” As it is almost impossible to hear
a word in that handsome, but .# deaf, building, we should say
of all things in want, of a hearing, that the House of Lords itself
deserves the greatest “setting down.”
A CyPREss WREATH roR THE CRYstal PALACE.-"It's the finest
Palace going.”
THE EARL OF DERBY'S DIGGINS.
WARIOUs important reflections are suggested by the statement of
LoRD DERBY, in his speech at Goldsmiths' Hall, that he had discovered
a British mine, yielding abundance of gold in the form of statesmen.
The first is a familiar proverb, which may be illustrated by the remark
that what pretends to be gold, turns out sometimes to be brass. Some
may think that the PREMIER has rather discovered a mare's nest—or
the nest of another quadruped—than a gold mine. Among the officers
of state there is a Gold Stick, but we have yet to learn whether or not
the DERBY Cabinet is simply composed of sticks of an ordinary kind.
Perhaps his Lordship has discovered the philosopher's stone, and has
thus been enabled to convert certain leaden ore into a field of precious
metal; and, if country i. may be regarded as pigs of lead, he
may be considered to have driven his pigs to a pretty market; at
least the pigs themselves will think so, should that market turn out
to be Free Trade. The noble Earl's alacrity at turning things to gold
reminds us of Midas, and the resemblance may perhaps be thought to
be completed by the style of jokes that he has got lately into the habit
of making after dinner. e augur favourably, from this, disposition
to jocularity. It promises that his Lordship will become a FreeTrader,
rceiving Protection to be no joke. At least he, will see that a dear
read Ministry can have no claim to those golden opinions that he
would claim for his Government, and is comparable, not to gold, but to
the baser metal of pinchbeck, or rather pinchbelly.
HOMOEOPATHIC REVELRY.
THE friends and supporters of the “London Homoeopathic Hospital”
held their anniversary festival the other day at the Albion. A dinner
is a sensible thing, and therefore the votaries of Homoeopathy cannot
be accused of unmitigated folly. The RIGHT HonouraBLE THE EARL
of ALBEMARLE presided as chairman; doubtless, this nobleman, so
distinguished in the scientific world, so well qualified, by anatomical,
physiological, nosological researches, to form a sound judgment on a
medical question, considered well what he was about before lending his
name and influence to a system which proclaims the whole science of
medicine, as professed by the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, a
mistake. The tickets, including wine, for this banquet, were a guinea
each, which proves that the HAHNEMANNITEs do not entirely carry out
their º: of “similia similibus,” as if they did, they would dine
for the good of º on homoeopathic fare, eat infinitesimal
globules of muscular and vegetable fibre, and drain goblets of pro-
portionate contents, considerably more diminutive than the acorn cups
of QUEEN MAB; to whose court homoeopathic doctors might well
enough be physicians. Subscriptions and donations are received for
this infinitesimal charity by certain bankers; but, neither are these
contributions expected to be infinitesimal, or we should be disposed to
beg the Homoeopathic Hospital's acceptance of the billionth part of a
grain of the perspiration of a sovereign which had been subjected to
Mosaic diaphoresis.
LOUIS NAPOLEON'S LAST CHANCE.
In his recent letter to the Times “An Englishman” remarks, speaking
of the late conversion of the French 3 per cents:—
“Concurrently with this financial “operation, an order was issued for 13 different
costumes for 13 sets of functionaries. We are not informed if the Bank may make
advances upon them, though the vast amount of the precious metals consumed in their
decoration would perhaps warrant it in doing so.”
In other words—there is a chance, this writer thinks, that the
|yersatile, Prince President (who is unquestionably the Governor of
the Bank, aforesaid) will shortly do a little. State business in the
Pawnbroking line! The conjecture is plausible, certainly; and we
are in hourly expectation of a decree confirming it. For, surely our
LITTLE NAP. . will. never lose the opportunity for so thoroughly
assimilating himself to that often-apostrophised prototype of his—
“My Uncle /*
“Stand not upon the Order of your Going 1"
It is said that a decree is about to appear in the Moniteur to settle
the questions of precedence concerning the great bodies—which are in
fact the great nobodies—of the State. Whatever may be the order of
precedence settled by the Moniteur, it is F. that they will some
day go * ºther, which will put an end to any difficulty as to which
is to go first.

GEE-HO, WAGNER 1
The name of the new Prima Donna from Berlin is not at all new to
musical circles. We recollect for a long time seeing advertised at
the cheap Harmonics about town the name of the “WARBLING
WAGGONER.”
THE GOLDEN AGE.
GoLD is being picked up so plentifully that the precious metal will soon
be voted preciously vulgar; and, in fact, it will be considered so little
worth the trouble of seeking, as to be absolutely infra dig. We shall
not be surprised to hear that the old legend of London streets being
paved with gold proves to be not without foundation, and that a stratum
ºf gold will some day turn up in one or other of the public thorough.
fares: Gold is being picked up in such abundance at }. Philip, that
we should not be astonished at finding some eccentric ticket-of-leave
man sending over, in a fit of liberality, a remittance in payment of the
National Debt. We shall feel no surprise if the next advices from
Australia inform us that it has been raining showers of gold, as well as
blowing clouds of gold dust. The only drawback on all this prosperity
is the awkward fact, that, the gold cannot be eaten; for it would be
difficult to turnit into golden pippins, or distil some of it into golden
sherry, while the pursuit of it is putting a stop to the cultivation of all
the necessary means of subsistence. A few golden ears of corn would
be a real blessing among all this embarras des richesses, which is not only
º all useful labour, but even the official business of the country
is likely to be at a stand-still. The police have runoff in a body to the
diggings; the clerks in the Government employ have run after the
police: and the Governor, the Bishop, and the Judge are left behind,
to do not only all the business of the country, but all the household
duties of their own private establishments. Velocipedes are said to be
already on their way out for the use of these functionaries, whoma
perhaps have themselves started for the diggings by the time the
consignments intended for them, may arrive. How a paltry fifteen
hundred a-year can retain the services of any man in a country where a
convict is picking up his two or three hundred a-week, we are quite
unable to conceive. The Governor must find it exceedingly difficult
to restrain himself; and indeed the position must be a very trying
one to the Judge, as well as to all the other parties concerned.

Miss Viol ET AND HER “OFFERS.”
CHAPTER W.
ALBANY–I mean MR. Swellſ NGTON.—has managed it at last, and
apa has introduced us. But, oh, how hard the poor young man did try
|...}. he succeeded! Suddenly, and I suppose for the first time in
his life, he began to pay attention to his dress; and really made himself
look exceeding * Wherever we went, papa and I, he contrived
to meet us accidentally. But it was all of no use. Papa used to give
him a good-natured nod, but never would enter into conversation; and
poor ALBANY was obliged to go away, day by day, looking perfectly
miserable, and wishing, most earnestly, I have no doubt, that the sea
* |would rise and wash away Brighton, or that the French would land
an army at the end of the pier, or some other little excuse arise for
his speaking to WIolet BRowpton.
“Miss Violet,” said papa, all of a sudden, as we were cantering
home from the Dyke one afternoon, “you must come to town with
me to-morrow to a christening party.”
“Why, papa, what people do we know that have been having a
baby?” I asked. -
“The Directors of the Circumnavigating Amalgamated Paddle-box
Steamboat Company,” replied papa; “and their baby, which is rather
a fine one, being two hundred feet long, is to undergo the ceremony of
immersion at Blackwall to-morrow, at high tide.”
“O, a launch, papa! That will be delightful. Only—”
“The bonnet you had on this morning will, on the contrary, do
exceedingly well, Miss Violen BRompton,” said papa, demurely, “and
so will the dress.”
Next day we were at Blackwall in very good time. We were most
politely received in a sort of great dark workshop, and were conducted
into an enormous yard, beyond which I could see the river. The yard
was studded with rows of immense º and between them, like some
huge black giant fish, was the vessel, with the wrong end towards us.
It gave one a great notion of vastness; but I had no time to think
about it, for three or four gentlemen, recognising papa, came up. As
soon as I was introduced, one of them—it was MR. WEEvil (he is a
dreadfully rich biscuit-exporter, but owns I don't know how many
Members of Parliament, and all sorts of things)—said,
“There’s your bottle, Miss BRompton. Don't be nervous about
smashing it.” -
I must have stared quite stupidly. Papa says that I can open my
eyes wider than any lady of his acquaintance, except one of the great
owls at Arundel. “I am to smash a bottle?” I repeated.
“There it hangs,” said MR, WEEvil, pointing. And surely enough
there was suspended by a cord from the bow of the vessel, a black wine
bottle. It hung half-way down, and a sort of scaffold or platform,
covered with red chintz, rose to meet it.
“The name is to be Chimborazo, if you please,” said another gentle:
man. “I will write it down, lest at the critical moment it should
escape you. I remember on a similar occasion a young. Scottish lady's
nervousness slightly confused her memory, and a beautiful ship for the
Mediterranean service, which it was intended to call the Lacedæmon,
went into the water as the Demon Lassie.”
“But you never mean that I am to christen the vessel?” I said, quite
in a flurry, as the idea broke upon my mind.
“Your papa was kind enough to write us word that the Chimborazo
would have that good fortune,” said the gentleman who had last spoken.
“And you never told me that, papa.”
“Or you would have rehearsed the part, my love, I suppose. Never
mind. We shall manage quite well.” -
A very intelligent-looking workman here came up, and touching his
cap, said something about the tide.
| “Very well,” said the gentleman who had told me the news, and
who I found was MR. Kelson, the builder of the ship, “everybody to
his post. Will Miss Brompton take hers?” -
Papa gave me his arm, and I mounted the scaffold with remarkable
composure, (what a terrible sentence if anybody should light upon it
without seeing what it means!) and on the little platform. I found
several ladies, friends of the Directors. MR. KELson, introduced me
to a few of them, and showed me how I was to draw back the bottle,
and let it break upon the bow of the great steamer. And then he, and
papa, and all the gentlemen went down, and scrambled upon projec-
tions which stuck out into the river, or upon planks stretched along
from post to post at a dizzy height, where they could command a better
view of the vessel. We, I mean the ladies, all began to talk and
laugh; those who had seen such sights before told as much as they could
tell, in a dreadful hurry; those who had not, inquired which way the
ship would go, and whether she was likely to fall over and crush us
...? why the sails were not all put in and spread out, which we agreed
would have made the sight much prettier. And all our little flurry and
excitement and chatter went on, and a great number of men were
busily at work below us, greasing the wood along which the ship was
to slide, when it suddenly occurred to me to pronounce the name I was

going to call the vessel. Good gracious me ! It had gone quite out of
my head...MR. KELson had forgotten to write it down, and I was
worse off than the poor young lady he mentioned, for I could not think
of anything like it. It was some mountain, that I was sure. I hastily
called up before me all the mountains I knew (just as they stand in the
º of Comparative Heights in our School Atlas), but I could not
it upon the right one. Himalaya sprang up behind Mont Blanc, and
Snowdon before Vesuvius, and the Pyrenees, and Alps, and Andes
literally danced round me, O, I, was so ashamed of myself!
-- *" I said, pitifully, “does any lady know the name of the
vessel ?”
Nobody knew—nobody had heard—one little girl, however, suggesting
that her brother had a boat at Broadstairs, last holidays, called the
Jumping Jimmy, and begging I would call this ship so, because that
would be fun.
How I looked round for assistance! But papa and everybody had
gone, and I could see their figures against the sky, at a distance which
at that moment seemed a thousand miles at least.
“What ever shall I do!” I said; and as I spoke, I happened to look
up, and very near us, but perched high up on a ledge where nobody but
a wild person would have thought of climbing, I saw a gentleman who
had clearly got there only that he might watch us. A glance told me
who it was. There clung the eternal ALBANY Swellington.
The other ladies discovering him, there was a general cry to him.
But he kept his eyes steadily on me.
“Anything wrong?” he shouted. “Can I be of any service?” And
though he was at least ten yards from the ground, he looked as if I had
only to say “Jump,” and down he would have gone.
... The name, the name?” cried a dozen voices.
“Ghimborazo,” he instantly replied, very distinctly. “Think of arms
akimbo and razors.” And in spite of his dangerous position, the earnest
creature illustrated his mnemonics by putting his arms to his sides, and
then by º: to shave. I could º help laughing, but I am
certain that he saw nothing to laugh at ; and was only zealous that I
should remember the name. I gave him, a grateful look--at least he
says so—and then a pistol went off, and all the ladies called upon me to
make haste. For there was the monster ship, which was to fight the
storms half round the world, ready to make her first plunge into the
water, and only waiting one word from the lips of a little girl.
I had prompters enough then, but I did not want them—the word
was said—the bottle fell in pieces from the side of the ship, with a great

splash of wine, and the next minute the immense mountain was sliding
away from before us, like a moving panorama, disclosing a new scene
of masts and posts, and workmen, and houses, and flags, all standing
out against the bright blue sky. Such cheering and shouting, as the
ship, making one plunge, shot out into the water, and then glided along
majestically, keeping her position as exactly as if, instead of her being
a mass of timbers and planks fastened together, nature had made her a
floating creature. But papa told me afterwards that, in all private
flºº. ships are built on sound mathematical º and that it
is only those built at the expense of the nation that tumble over and
sail backwards, and are altogether blunders. - -
When papa rejoined us, I could not help telling him what a fright
I had been in, and of ALBANY’s kind assistance. He listened very
quietly; but when he heard of the pantomime with which the inform:
ation had been accompanied, he laughed very heartily, and declared
there was “something in that young fellow.” And no sooner did he
see MR. SwellingtoN looking for a place at the beautiful déjelſner
MR. KElson gave us all, at LovEGRove's Hotel, to celebrate the
launch, than he pointed to a chair next to me, . ALBANY’s grateful dart
at it was beautiful to behold; and so was his pleasure, when papa,
introducing him to me, thanked him for having prompted a young lady
who had forgotten her geography.
BIGOTRY AT BIRMINGHAM.
MAN tumbles into a deep ditch. A
well-meaning passer-by seeks
to pick him out. “Stop!”
cries the man floundering in
the mire—“are you a Catho-
lic?” “I am.” “You are!
Then, go your way, and let
me scramble as I may in the
filth.”
Another man's house begins
to blaze. And another man
takes up a bucket of water to
quench the rising conflagra-
tion. “Stop! What’s your
religion?” “Catholic!” “Be
off! and let my habitation
burn to the ground.”
Another breaks his leg. A
surgeon is sent for; and is
about to bestow his skill upon the fractured limb. “Sir” says the
patient, “my nurse informs me that you go to mass; and therefore,
without laying a finger upon my leg, you’ll leave my house.”
Mrs. Chisholm, by her own energy—her own sagacious power—has
done more to assist the cause of emigration than any knot of English
statesmen. Thousands of the ignorant and the destitute, both in this
country and in Ireland, a burden to themselves and a pest to society-
thousands of wretched creatures, by the means of MRs. CHIsholm, have
been sent to the Antipodes to find there homes and social comforts,
and what commonly results from these—self-respect.
MRs. Chisholm visits Birmingham; but she is a Catholic, and the
philanthropists of Birmingham cannot work with her—
* MR. James referred to a weekly London paper, which had in a leader made some
animadversions on MRs. Chisholm's scheme as capable of being misapplied to proselyte
emigrants to the Roman Catholic religion, of which she herself was a zealous prºfessor.
Mrs. Chisholm repelled these charges, and stated her wish, though "a Catholic, to act
justly to the emigrants in religious and all other matters."
A truth, nobly illustrated by the untiring practice of a most admirable
lady: a truth averred by the friendship and patronage of the EARL of
SHAFTEs BURy, a nobleman not to be suspected of Popish sympathies.
However, MR. JAMEs, MR. MILLER, and MR. BULL, would not act
with Mrs. Chisholy to provide a home for the outcast and the
wretched.
Mr. JAMEs is the man in the mire, who will not be picked out by a
Catholic. -
MR. MILLER has his house in a blaze, and forbids a Papist to empty
a bucket upon the fire.
MR. Buil, languishes with a broken leg; and no surgeon who hears
mass, shall presume to set it. . .
Such the zeal to be found among certain Brummagem philanthropists.
The Order of the Bath.
HER MAJESTY, we are informed by the Court Circular, held, the
other day, an Investiture of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath,
and knighted Lord BRoughton, and several distinguished, officers.
We hope it will not be very long ere we shall be gratified by the
announcement that the QUEEN has conferred the Knighthood of the
Bath on some clever fellow who shall have contrived to supply every
inhabitant of the Metropolis with the materials for that luxury, or
rather necessary, in the shape of a cheap and abundant supply of pure
soft water. - -

HOW TO SERVE INVADERS.
ſº IR-Really I must say,
| if you will allow me,
as a party. that fre-
quently derive amuse-
ment from your enter-
taining facetia, that
you are missing a
subject w" wº.gratify
many gents like my-
self, by an agreeable
excitement of the risi-
bles. I allude, Sir, to
the Militia Bill & the
National Defences, ge-
nerally speaking, as
such preparations for
hostilities must neces-
sarily be attended
with an amount of
taxation w” I sha de-
scribe as an awful
sacrifice. A little
seasonable ridicule of
volunteers & militia-
men wº be of great
service in preventing
such superfluous ex-
pense, if you w” be so
obliging as to devote
some of your superior
articles & splendid
illustrations with this
view. I am afraid, however, Mr. Punch, that you do not quite partake
of my sentiments on the subject of invasion.
“For my part, Sir, I have no hesitation in saying that I see
no reason at all for spending our money to prevent the French
from attacking this country. If they were to come over here,
it is highly improbable that they we inflict any serious injury
on us, if we received them with good-humour. They w” only
kick us a little, &c., but we soon cease to be unpleasant if we did
them, the agreeable. , Being a remarkably gallant people, I do not
apprehend they wº behave rude to our female relatives ; but, on
the contrary, believe they wº be polite & attentive to the fair sex.
There is no fear they wº attempt to destroy us; their object is
merely to triumph over us for the honour and glory of so !.
Indeed, that is too much to say; for I apprehend, Sir, that it is merely
our army and navy, and not ourselves, that they wº wish to humiliate.
Any slight depredations they might commit w" soon terminate, & wº
not, I sh" say, amount to half the sum national defences will cost us.
Besides, as soon as we had quietly submitted to them, they wº become
our customers; just as their army, no doubt, is now doing in Rome,
w" w” soon indemnify us for any little loss we might suffer from them.
As for their enslaying us, I shall be most happy to serve them. The
French, Mr. Punch, will not harm us, unless we offer them resistance;
& instead of paying troops to do that, let us organise a band to
receive M. Louis NAPOLEON, should that gent oblige us with the
favour of a visit, playing, “See the Conquering Hero Comes 1’
“Why, you see, Sir, suppose the metropolis were defended against
an enemy, even if the defence were successful, there w” be more
parties killed, more windows broken, & a greater loss of property
than there w” be if we made no opposition.
“I am a party without prejudice, Mr. Punch. My views are those
of a cosmopolite. I look on mankind as one specie. It might be
unpleasant to the nobs for England to become a province of France;
but for my part I sh" not object to that arrangement; as I do not
consider it would be detrimental to business; which is the main thing.
I am quite aware that these sentiments may be thought by some
parties to be of an inferior description; but, Sir, peace at any price—
its price not being £ºs. d, is the motto'of that humble gent who has
the honour to be, Your obedient Servant,

English Eloquence in France.
THE French Academy—on the suggestion of MonTALEMBERT-have
offered a prize of 4,000 francs for the best Essay on “Political Eloquence
in England.” The Essay is to begin with CHATHAM and end with
CANNING. Why not rather introduce the practical results of English
Eloquence; beginning with the Freedom of the Press, and ending with
Habeas Corpus f
A SENTIMENTAL CANDIDATE.
THE Ex-Railway King has been recently addressing the electors of
Sunderland in a strain of pathos almost sufficient, to draw tears from a
pºliceman's bull's-eye, or touch the heart of the stoutest cabbage.
The following extract must not be looked at, until the reader has pre-
pared himself with an extra pocket-handkerchief and a large eyeglass,
in which to catch the copious discharge likely to take place from the
lachrymal glands. , Whoever proceeds without taking the precaution
we have suggested, will do so at his peril.
“There are times,” said the speaker, “when the stoutest heart quails; there are
times when all the feelings of human nature are wrung, and almost call aloud for
support; but I refer to my warm and kind friends surrounding me, and I have said
when all have forsaken me, Sunderland has remained firm to me. (Cheers.) I say
again, in the presence of some of my own family, who may succeed me ere long, if that
family were ever to be ungrateful to the town of Sunderland, I could almost rise up
from my grave and curse them. (Hear, hear.) My right hand shall forget her
cunning, before I shall forget the favours I have received at your hands. (Applause.)
The sacrifices I have made have cost me many anxious thoughts.”
We can appreciate the gratitude expressed by the Ex-Railway
monarch towards Sunderland, for not having hauled him over its cele-
brated coals. His threat to his family that his ghost will make its
appearance, is evidently suggested by the Corsican Brothers; but even
the realisation of this spectral suggestion is less improbable than the
declaration that the right hand of the Hon. Member will “forget its
cunning.” Such a result is almost impossible in the case of such a
very knowing hand.

Taxes on knowledge are objected to, and taxes on food are objected
to; in fact, there is so much objection to every species of taxation, that
it is very difficult to determine what to tax. The least unpopular of
imposts, it has been suggested, would be a tax on vanity and folly, and
accordingly a proposition has been made to lay a tax upon stays ; but
this is opposed by political economists on the ground that such a
duty would have a tendency to check consumption.

THE RUPERT of Debate and his Semitic CHANCELLOR OF THE

the commoner is pressed for a reply, he implores the House to wait for
his financial statement. In short, the one agrees “to cry Mum,”
and the other “to cry Budget.”

SUGGESTIONS FOR SONG-WRITERs.
In a song, as in a conveyance, it is everything to “make a title,”
and we have therefore thrown together a few “first lines,” which may
be used either in their present order, or they may be varied by any
process of shuffling consistent with the rules of rhyme and metre. The
whole song, or any part of it, is quite at the service of any of our
modern balladists who may be in want of any material of the kind:
“I can't forget thee if I would.”
“You’ll meet me—won't you—in the glen?”
“I dare not love thee, if I could.”
“My heart is broken now as then.”
“Can memory teach me to forget ’’’
“To-morrow is a bitter word.”
“He loves me, or he loves me not.”
“Thine is the only name that's heard.”
“Oh! do not say that I must go.”
“I feel that you and I must part.”
“She breathed soft words in murmurs low.”
“There is a canker at my heart.”
“Affection is a sacred tie.”
“The past we never can recall.”
“Beneath the willow let me lie.”
“We met—'twas at a fancy ball.”
“WHERE IS THE HOLY LAND Pº
This childish question torments us daily. It stares us in the face
each morning with our Times, and repeats itself to our unwilling eyes
in huge red-lettered posters throughout the day. The very type,
indeed, appears to blush at the lamentable ignorance it reveals. An
well it may: for, really, it is distressing to think that, in this era of
enlightenment, this present March (we mean no pun) of Intellect, there
can yet be found an individual whose geography has been so sadly
neglected. And still more heart-rending is it to contemplate the lonely
lot that forces him to seek the knowledge he requires through the
unnatural medium of a public advertisement.
We would seriously direct the attention of our Education Com-
missioners to the fact; and would further urge the propriety of some
benevolent philanthropist at once investing ; sympathies and five
shillings in the cause, by the insertion of an answering advertisement
to the effect, that “the Advertiser may obtain the information he
requires, by application, during class-time, at any of our Infant Charity
or Ragged Schools.”
The Parson of Frome without the F.
“INFIRMITY” is alleged as the excuse of the Bishop of BATH AND
WELLsfor sanctioning MR. BENNETT's preferment to the living of Frome.
The “infirmity” seems to have consisted in a weakness of perception,
by reason of which the Bishop cannot distinguish between the §.
of Rome and the Church of Frome.
RECENT ADDITION TO THE CHAMBER or Hortrons.
THE horror of our friend SIBTHoRP, on seeing it stated in a public
rint that his Fº: had been lately noticed at a Meeting for the
reservation of the Crystal Palace!
A SAFE PROPHECY.
REALLY, the weather is becoming a conversational bore of greater
itude than we are used to, even in England. We doubt if the
“oldest inhabitant” can remember a time when it was more vigorously
talked about. At least one hundred and fifty times aday, our opinion is
privately consulted as to the probable duration of the drought. And,
publicly, too, almost everybody we meet keeps popping the eternal ques-
tion—“When are we to have rain?” And no dares in the vaguest
way to answer it. March, they re-echo, has º and given us pecks
enough of its dust to ransom all the kings that ever reigned—from
David downwards. April, too, is gone, and scarce a dozen drops of her
proverbial showers have sprinkled us. Even Greenwich Fairhas, this
ear, come without its usual deluge. And still the barometrical
ittle Dutch—ess keeps perversely out of doors, and our despondin
umbrella-makers draw nearer and nearer to that Pantomimic P
Settlement—the “Cavern of Despair.”
Now, we are not a MURPHY, and to weather-wisdom in general we
make but small pretensions. But, in this particular instance, we think
we have asufficiently safe barometer by us to venture our meteorological
reputation upon its prophetic veracity. For, by reference to our
En º we find that there is a Chiswick Féte appointed for
Saturday, the 13th of May; and abundant experience teaches us to
expect that it will prove, as usual, a celestially Aquatic one!
WHAT IS SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE, &c.
Should the Corn Laws be restored, it is probable that severa
Protectionist parties will spring up, for the purpose of demanding at
the hands of Parliament such measures as the ruined interests require.
The following will be a few of the principal claimants, in the event of
the renewal of Free Trade:–
The Protectionist Post-Boys will demand a repeal of all the Railway
Acts that have ever been passed.
The Protectionist Watchmen will agitate for the instant abolition
of the Police force, which has been the utter ruin of their class.
The Protectionist Watermen will ask that a heavy duty may be
enforced, for their benefit, on every traveller by Steam-boat between
Richmond and London Bridge.
The Protectionist Tinder-Box Manufacturers will clamour, for the
º: of a tax of one shilling upon every box of Lucifers or Congreve
1ghts.
The above are only a few of the cases in which the success of the
cry for Protection would lead to analogous, demands. Perhaps an
amalgamation of the Agricultural Protectionists with one or all of the
classes specified might be arranged.
Second Thoughts are Best.
SIR FITzRoy KELLY has been trying to explain at Ipswich his state-
ment at Harwich, that the people of England had not had “an ounce
more bread” in consequence of Free Trade, and he has amended his
assertion, by saying “that the people have not had one pound weight
per head more to eat in is 50” than they had been previously
accustomed to...It is something gained to have got up from one ounce
d|to twenty-six millions of pounds in a few days; and, if Sun FitzRoy
goes on at this rate, increasing his estimate of the consumption of food,
we have no doubt we shall find ourselves soon agreeing with him as to
the extent of the gain by the repeal of the Corn Laws. When he fixed
the additional food at an ounce, we hardly expected he would long
adhere to such an absurd an-ounce-ment.
A veteran Cutting his Teeth.
Among the multiplicity of losses advertised in the papers, we never
expected to meet with such an announcement as the following, which
appeared in the Times of Wednesday:-
“LOST, a set of Antificial Tººth, supposed to have been dropped in the neighbour-
hood of Hanover Square, on the 7th of April.”
That a man, may drop his handkerchief without missing it, or even
let his spectacles slip from his nose, imperceptibly, we may manage to
believe; but that any individual could have had his eyes shut to the
sudden shedding of all his teeth, is a picture we vainly attempt to
realise. We recommend the advertiser to consider seriously whether
all his teeth may not have been knocked down his throat without his
being aware of it.
NewsPAPER Voracity.—It was said in the debate on the newspaper
question that the Times is eating up all its contemporaries. If this
be the case, the Times is doing more for its opponents than the public
are disposed to do, for some of the journals in question, while being
eaten up by the Times, can find no one else to swallow them.

MISS VIOLET AND HER “OFFERS.”
—º-
CHAPTER WI.
“The christening breakfast is a pretty good one, ehl Miss WIOLET P”
said papa. “Give me four of those amiable prawns, and tell me whether
you approve of the Amalgamated Paddle-boxes P’’ -
I confessed I thought the scene quite delightful. It was a beautiful
afternoon; the water was very high, and at Blackwall you get two such
large, broad views of the river, that with the help of a little imagi-
nation, (and, as papa very wickedly remarked, a little champagne,) you
may believe yourself to be far away from dear old poky, choky,
smoky London. And then our déjeiner was so nicely managed. A
long table, covered with glass, silver, and flowers, interspersed only
with dishes, which, as the genteel cookery-books say, “look elegant,”—
jellies spangled with gold leaf, ivory blanc-mange gemmed with straw-
berries like rubies, fairy temples of amber sugar, vases of preserved
fruits of delicious tºº. such a P. picture, that I was
quite vexed with the greedy creatures who broke it up without the
least ceremony.
Our party was a large one. The Chairman of the Company, SIR
CowRY PICE—the dearest oki man you ever saw ; tall, and white-
haired, but still very handsome, and his nice old kind voice just be-
inning to weaken, but not in the least cracked—he was at the head.
ight and left of him were the ladies, between the gentlemen who
brought them. But the ladies were too few for the civilisation of any
great length of the table, and two long lines of black-coated creatures
made a perspective, at the end of which was a gentleman who was
incessantly shouting to everybody to take wine with him. He was also
a Director of the Amalgamated, and he amalgamated his own directions
shockingly towards the end of the lunch, and no wonder, considering
how many times his glass had been filled.
The pretty things on the table were, sadly pushed about to make
room for turtle-soup, and white-bait, and cotelettes à la financière, and
other matters, which made, as an Irish gentleman opposite poetically
observed, “not a bad, imitation of a cowld, collation.” And the
champagne corks popped in every direction; and as for the waiters, they
flew about with the bottles, as if what ALBANY said were true; namely
that any waiter would be discharged who saw an empty glass and di
not instantly fill it. As for papa, he was enjoying himself. greatly in
his quiet way, and I was quite delighted to see what attention all the
leading gentlemen paid him, telling him little bits of confidential news
which seemed to relate to very important subjects, and waiting for his
answers, with evident respect. One of the guests was a Member of Par-
liament, I found. He was dreadfully ugly, with yellow hair, and all his
forehead puckered into wrinkles, occasioned, papa said, by his sitting up
all night to learn tremendously long sums by heart, that in the House he
might spatter out the figures against all his enemies. Near him was a
young barrister, with a white cravat and diamond studs, and he worried
the clever arithmetical Member sadly by trying to be smart at the end
of each of the other's remarks.
“You set the Speaker a little Rule-of-Three work last night, MR.
PHRACTION, I see,” said papa.
“Ah! yes,” said MR. PHRAction, with a look and tone of great
vexation, “but the papers have utterly spoiled the speech, utterly
vitiated my argument. Don’t read it.”
“I won't,” said papa; “rely upon my friendship to that extent, and
". any similar occasion. But what have they made you say—indeed,
what was the question? I hardly looked.”
“Why, SIR BARNAcIE MAUL had moved, and very properly, that
every Bishop appointed to a see in Wales should be able to speak
Welsh. Thereupon, MUMMERY NIMBUs, the Puseyite, moved as an
amendment, that every Colonial Bishop should be blacked all over, or
tattooed, according to the state of the flock he was sent to. I supported
MAUL ; but you will not comprehend my reasons, for instead of
18493724, the figures I used, they have printed 19531876. It’s very
provoking.”
... But, what on earth,” said papa, “have those awful figures to do
with a clerical question?”
“Every question is a question of figures,” said MR. PHRActION,
gloomily, “especially clerical ones.”
“But not of lay figures,” snapped in the smart young barrister.
“And if I were the Speaker, I would stop your arithmetic in the lan-
guage of the Matilda-press novels, and say. Figure to yourself— ”
MR. PHRACTION waited very quietly until the smart gentleman had
let off his two little jokes, and then he said:
., “My numbers were the number of Welsh people who would very
likely have gone to church, if their bishops had spoken Welsh since the
lst of March, 1800.”
“By Jove!” exclaimed ALBANY, who for the first moment had
turned his attention to anybody but his neighbour. “I beg your
; but I mean that I don’t understand how you calculate such a
matter.”
Papalooked up at MR. ALBANY, as much as to say, “Now, you have
caught it!”
“Thus,” said MR. PHRACTION., “Take the number of churches and
what they will hold, and the registers of marriages and baptisms, and
multiply these by the assessed taxes, subtracting the paupers in work-
houses, who have chapels therein, and subtracting also the prisoners in
jails, who probably are not regular attendants at church; add the god-
fathers º godmothers to the bridesmen and bridesmaids, deducting
three per cent. for bridesmaids under the age of fourteen, and two per
cent, for Dissenting ones who will not go to church, but only eat the
breakfast,-dividing, also, the freeholders by the copyholders, and mul.
tiplying the tenants-at-will who vote for church candidates—”
“By the tenants-at-won’t, who go in for the schi in shop”—dashed
in the smart barrister; and so poor ALBANY was saved, M. R. PhRACTION,
who was put out, promising to write it all down for him. Proud of his
victory, the barrister turned to a French lady who, with her husband,
had been invited to see the launch.
Mada- ne parle par note langue?” he asked, with a patronising
smile.
Madame looked at her husband, who brought up his lingual forces
with the utmost alacrity.
“Ah!” he said, laughing good-naturedly, “not too much well. Not
still. At the good time;. She commence.”
“C'est difficile,” said Madame, smiling.
“Say pray, say vray,” gracicusly returned the Englishman ; “say tro
pray. May,” he continued, wishing to be spirituel, “le tong fy mirark.
Regardez-mwaw, je le parle tray faceelmong, muaw.”
“But Monsieur is an English person?” asked the gentleman, not
apprehending the joke. .. -
“Say pray,” again replied the barrister. “Set oon petee calenbug de
muraw, say too.”
“Ah!” said the Frenchman; and courteously commenced laughin
heartily, in a high key, as soon as he understood that the other h
intended to amuse him. And the latter, with great earnestness, remarked
to us how the acquisition of a foreign language humanised society, and
promoted universal brotherhood.
As for ALBANY, he was so happy, that he agreed with everybody, but
certainly without listening to auybody but me, with a slight, excep-
tion in favour of papa. MR. PHRACTION's wonderful problem diverted
him for a moment; I suppose, because, having been accustomed (as he
admitted) to think of “the odds,” which is some kind of equestrian
arithmetic-calculations were easy to him. Indeed, papa congratulated
him on this, and told him to mind his “book,” as, if he got into
No. 565.

Parliament it might recommend him to the favour of a horse-racing
Ministry. But ALBANY declared that he had given all such things up
and was reading very hard for the bar. I cannot say that he talked
well; indeed he was far too happy to care much what he said, but he
seemed to know something on most subjects. Only his ideas came out
as if he had not been in the habit of drawing upon them—as if he had
associated with people on whom they would have been wasted. I
think he was a little surprised at finding that I did not talk, perhaps,
quite such nonsense as some men think all girls talk. But it is too
* to tell what he thought about me.
hen everybody had finished lunch, SIR Cowry PICE stood up, and
suddenly six gentlemen, a little below us, pulled out six pencils, and
next day all the world knew exactly what the dear old man had said.
He proposed that, we should all wish good fortune to the great ship we
had seen launched, and which was!". then, we could see, being towed
into the dock, to be finished. And, looking very kindly at me, he added
something which I should actually be ashamed to write down, only that
the six gentlemen were good enough to rap their pencils on the table,
and then to take down SIR CowRy’s exact words. #. said that, let the
good ship Chimborazo touch at a thousand shores, as he heartily hoped
she might do, for the sake of the dividend (here all the gentlemen
... ed), as well as for her own, she would never find a more
charming person than the young lady who had that day done her the
honour of giving her a name.
The company applauded, papanodded, as much as to say—“Yes, she’s
not so disagreeable,” and, as for ALBANY, I believe he was meditating a
leap upon his chair for the purpose of leading off the Kentish fire, or
some such tremendous demonstration; but I happened, providentially,
to give him an appealing look, which so bewildered him that his purpose
failed him, and he contented himself with giving, in a most intense
whisper, his zealous assurance to me, that SIR Cowry Pice had not
said half enough in my praise.
THE MOSAIC ARAB AT THE CAPE.
R. PUNCH,-Under the head
of news from the Cape of
Good Hope, a morning con-
temporary makes the follow-
ing statement, which is not
altogether perspicuous
** Some Hottentot women were
also taken prisoners, who stated
that pack bullocks laden with gun-
powder, passed the T'Somo, sup-
posed to have been obtained from
Moshesh, and on the way to the
lower country, to the Gaikas and
Galekas. Moshesh is said to sell
unpowder openly, at a store kept
or that purpose; and that his
chief article of barter with Euro-
peans who go to that part, is that
commodity.’
“Who is this Mosh ESH
that sells gunpowder among
- - - - the Kaffirs? Is Moshºsh
an individual, or a name employed, as it sometimes is in familiar
discourse, to denote the Hebrew community?, Moshºsh, I was
aware, is to be met, with almost everywhere; but I hardly expected
to find him in Kaffirland, following the occupation of a gunpowder
merchant. . At least, I should never have supposed that, anything
more nearly connected, with gunpowder than a shooting-jacket would
be found in the establishment of MR. MoshesH. “INQUIRER.”
Meat and Money.
A FRENCHMAN, discoursing elegantly, and accurately, of course—as
all Frenchmen do—upon England, says, “The English love their meat
and their money more than anything else. These are their two great
absorbing passions. When they are not eating, they are making
money; and when not occupied in the counting-house, they are sure to
be in the larder. To prove to what an extent, they carry these two
passions, I may mention that there are no other objects they love
enough to treasure. They have but two 'safes’—one for their meat,
the other for their money. If I had to draw the beau idéal of an
Englishman, I would represent him with a Meat-safe on one hand, and
a Money-safe on the other.”
RATIONAL ExCISE.

education, they would certainly be much more productive.

A LESS ON FOR YOUT H.
Who is Rosas P
Don't laugh at this question, small children. Read your Times. In
that paper you will see that when GENERAL Rosas landed last Tuesday
week at Devonport, he was received by the Commodore Superintendent,
SIR MICHAEL SEYMoUR. And it goes on to say:
“shortly after landing, the General took up his quarters at Moorshead's Royal Hotel,
Forestreet, Devonport, where he was visited by the Port Admiral, SIR John OMMANNEy,
and other heads of departments.”
You know that SIR John OMMANNEY is not famous for looking sharp,
or attending even to a matter of consequence with great alacrity.
Then the Times adds:
“SIR John Rolt, the Commander of the Forces in the Western District, was pre-
vented by sickness from calling at the hotel.”
You must not suggest, precocious juveniles, that SIR John Rolt did
well in not calling on Rosas, because he certainly would have got more
sick if he had called. For, observe, we further read, that
“In consequence of a Treasury order, every respect was paid by the officers of the
Conflict to the noble visitor, and at the Custom-house every facility was given for the
ready clearance of his baggage.”
No doubt a foreign visitor, whom the Commodore. Superintendent
receives in person, and the Port Admiral goes and calls on, as soon as
he arrives; whom the Commander of the District Forces is only pre-
vented from showing the same attention by illness; and to whom the
officers of one of HER MAJESTY's ships are ordered by the Treasury to
pay every respect, is one whom Government delights to honour. Of
course he must be a great and good man; some nob'e champion of

opinion we had conceived about him.
Otherwise, young people, we may certainly say that, whenever a
cargo for the Zoological Gardens arrives at Devonport, Commodore
Superintendent, Port Admiral, Commander of District Forces, and
Government, will, if there should be a hyaena in the collection, and
they are not as attentive to him as they have been to the ex-Dictator
of Buenos Ayres, have been guilty of gross partiality to Rosas, and
will do great injustice to the hyaena.
Philosophy of “Marriage in High Life.”
We have often wondered why it is that in celebrating a “Marriage
in High Life,” the clergyman, usually a bishop, is in general, as the
Morning Post says, “assisted” by the Rev. M.R. So-AND-so: why the
parson requires another parson to help him to perform so very easy a
task as that of reading the Marriage Service. At last it has occurred
to us that the reason may be, that, as marriages among the “superior
classes” are for the most part merely political or pecuniary arrange-
ments, the antipathy of the parties to each other is so strong that it
takes two parsons, with extraordinary power, to unite them.
Military Science.
ExPERIMENTs have been going on at Woolwich Marshes with a new
modification of the Minié rifle. The weapon itself will hit any object
within sight; a celebrated advertising optician has invented a small
telescope, which, mounted over the breech-end of the barrel, extends
the distance whereat the marksman can see, to a dozen miles. The
design of the experiments has been to satisfy several veteran officers of
rank as to whether or no the range of ball would be equal to the
range of vision. The point has not yet been satisfactorily decided; and
to settle it, a farther series of trials is considered necessary.
A PARTIAL conversion.

of Popery, º, presenting his chaplain at Court, simply as the WERY
REVERENd D. O'Connor, Chaplain to MR. SHERIFF SwiFT. --

LEARNED FLEAS.
N our innocence we imagined that the
fondness for fleamanship was a thing
defunct. We own we viewed it as a
passion of the past—exploded long ago
with Beaver hats and Hessian boots.
And in our category of “extinct races”
we credulously classed the genus of
“Industrious Fleas,” and blindly be-
lieved that in this educated era no effort
would be ever made to effect its resto-
ration.
But we were deceived. On revient
toujours—the proverb tells us–à ses
premiers amours. And accordingly we
find that the great and enlightened Bri-
tish Nation quits on a sudden, the intel-
lectual enjoyments with which its pro-
fessors have Polytechnically surfeited it,
- and reverting gladly to its former joys,
seeks amusement once again in the
gambols of a flea' º the Times
assures us that the mania has revived:
daily are we plagued with posters to the
same effect; and although we cannot
applaud the national taste, we are bound, as current chroniclers to
notice it. From such slight “signs of the times” may the future
MacAULAY deduce we know not how interesting an inference.
The observant reader of advertisements will doubtless have remarked,
that fleas are not merely made Indus-
trious now, but absolutely Learned. For
this we presume we are indebted to the
March of Intellect; and it, is indeed a
gratifying proof of the rapid progress it
is making with the Brute Creation.
Our pigs have long since owned its
sway; and now, it seems, our very fleas
acknowledge it. Whatmarvels, reader,
may we not predict from these seven-
league-booted strides
At one of the Shows—“Exhibitions,”
we mean, of “these interesting little
creatures” (see advertisement), we are a
informed that “fleas in full costume”
will daily astonish the Universe by
“dancing the Polka.” To the curious
in such matters this is really a tempting
announcement. A flea in full dress
would be quite a novelty to us. Our
only acquaintance has been with fleas
au naturel: and we doubt if even
STRUTT could enlighten us on the sub-
ject of their “full costume.”
Another advertisement invites us to a select re-union of “fleas of all
mations giving their mechanical entertainments.” We confess that
this slightly, puzzles, us. We have rather a misty notion as to
what their “mechanical entertainments” can º; be. More-
over, we think the substantive a decidedly ill-chosen one. We
certainly never found a flea
“entertaining” in any sense,
and wequestion if eventhose
at this second Omni-national
ºxhibition would prove ex-
ceptions to the rule. Nor
§ does our experience incline
| usto comply with the request
preferred in the next adver-
tisement, which begs us,
somewhat º to
"Be sure and ask for the
Russian fleas.” Russian,
or not, assuredly a flea is
one of the last things we
should ever dream of “asking
for.”
We are not unnaturally
- nervous, but we must say,
we trust that sufficient precautions are taken by the respective managers
of these establishments to prevent the possibility of their performers
ever getting surreptitiously “out on the loose.” This Russian troupe,
for instance, would be a most formidable one to encounter; for it is
º said to number no less than 200 able-bodied actors, strong!
e are not aware if a census of these “interesting little creatures”
has recently been taken in that country: so considerable an emigration
would somewhat have affected it. There are no “mechanical entertain-
ments,” or “polkas in full costume,” to allure us here; but there is a
§§ act of fleamanship (as we suppose) announced, under the rather
taking title of “NAPoleon on the Russian Flea, HERCULEs.” Com-
#." is ºfely needless here. Only imagine, reader, a HERCULES

HABITS OF THE NICE YOUNG MAN.
ATTENDs evening parties—and hands the muffins round.
Smiles if he burns his fingers with the kettle.
Plays the flute.
Sings “Do you love me now as then?”
Parts his hair in the middle.
Takes an umbrella with him to an evening party.
Wears goloshes after dusk.
Has a secret passion for gruel.
Writes acrostics, and contributes to Ladies' Albums.
Curls his whiskers. -
S Is º “Hon.Sec.” to the “Ladies’ Benevolent Mangle Distribution
ociety.”
Keeps a cat, and a regular account of his daily expenses.
His greatest pleasure is to attend a meeting at Exeter Hall, and his
next greatest pleasure is to have his name mentioned “amongst those
whom we observed on the platform,” &c., &c. -
His fondest tie, next to an aged grandmother, is that of his white
neckcloth.
Can hum the Overture to Der Freischütz.
Carries a pincushion, and acidulated drops, about with him, and is
never unprovided with a scent-bottle, for fear of accidents.
Goes out in the rain to fetch a cab.
Doesn’t smoke.
Helps Mamma's shawl on with the grace of one of Holmes' shopmen.
Has his hair and handkerchief full of scents, and it is a pity the same
cannot be said of his head.
Holds a skein of silk with exemplary patience—turns over the leaves
of music with great digital skill-reads novels in a clear secretary-like
voice—laughs affetuoso –lisps moderato—jokes with the old maids
allegro-quotes poetry penseroso—runs ladies’ errands prestissimo—and
makes himself generalto usefulo.
Such are the Habits of the NICE. YoUNG MAN.
A Treat for Electors.
A Discussion took place the other evening in the House of
Commons, on the subject of treating at elections, which by some
honourable Members was regarded as a species of corruption. But is
this quite so? A medical man may be the candidate for a seat in
Parliament. Would he be guilty of treating if he attended a voter for
the influenza? We hope MR. WAKLEY may again stand for Finsbury.
Will the hon. gentleman be accused of having treated one of his
constituents if he shall have been proved to have prescribed a free and
independent elector a black dose
Count CIRCULAR OF ANCIENT BRITAin.
AN antiquary has forwarded us a specimen of a joke—which, coming
from such a source, may perhaps be a relic of the olden time—to the
effect that the first Court Circular was ARTHUR's Round Table.
Silence in the Gallery.
From that most authentic of sources, “Our own Correspondent,” we
learn, that a favoured half-dozen or so of “the million” are most
graciously allowed admission into the French Assembly during the
Debates. There is but one small qualification necessary to entitle an
applicant to this º: privilege; and that, we believe, is a medical
certificate from the Deaf and Dumb Asylum.
NOVEL IMPORTATION,
Foreign, sheep, oxen, and pigs, have for some time been included
among our imports. In addition to cattle from various countries, we
have, now that Rosas has arrived, had a butcher also imported.
FARMERs' FANCIES.
AGRICULTURAL gentlemen sometimes make the mistake of calling
manures maroeuvres. This may arise from a confusion of ideas, as is
further, probable from the fact that the same gentlemen are also
inclined to trust rather to Protectionist legislation than to guano.

CONCESSION IN KENSINGTON GARDENS.
THE beautiful walk on the south side of Kensington Gardens, leading
from the Barracks to Hyde Park, has been widened for the accommoda-
tion of the public by an extremely clever expedient. Whether the present
or the late Commissioners of Public Works are to be thanked for this,
we do not know ; we wish we did, being always anxious to give credit
where it is due. The path in question lies between two shrub an
flower beds; and was formerly separated from them on either side by a
strip of º fresh, green turf. Then, also, it was smoothly rolled,
but lately, requiring renovation, it has been relaid with a sort of débris
of broken shells and shingle, forming a surface of sharp cutting edges
and angles, which deſy, or would destroy, the soles of any boots not
strongly hobnailed. This judicious alteration has, of course rendered
the i. itself ineligible as a promenade for the ladies, nursemaids, an
children, who used to frequent it as such, and indeed im racticable for
anybody whatever but a clod-hopper, shod º for hopping clods.
The consequence is, that the people have taken to walk on the turf-
borders, which they have now entirely worn bare and trodden into
uniformity with the footway, thus adding full two feet to the breadth
of the latter, if not perhaps proportionally improving its appearance.
WAGNER ON ENGLAND.
WAGNER seems to be something more than a *: if we may judge
by the little expression he permitted himself to let drop with reference
to England in a letter to one of his countrymen. “England is worth
nothing except for her money,” says the German Ex-actor, for it seems
he was once upon the stage, and therefore the term Ex-actor may be in
one, if not in two, senses applied to him. We suspect that our friend
WAGNER will experience a realisation of his ideas as to the value of
money in England, by the quantity of coin he will be compelled to part
with in consequence of the sundry little matters Re WAGNER that have
been going on in the Court of Chancery for the last week or two.
There is something beautifully retributive in the justice which seems
to have so ordered matters that he who “came to grasp” will be
obliged to “stop to pay” in the land which he only values for its
money. Père WAGNER will find that if England is the country for
making money, it is also the country in which to spend it, and his
introduction to our Court of j will show him that while we
were prepared to pay rather exorbitantly for his daughter's voice, he,
the Père, will have to pay pretty dearly for his own whistle.

CLERGY.MARKET AND ECCLESIASTICAL INTELLIGENCE.
Bishops were quoted in the House of Commons on Thursday evenin
last by the MARQUIs or BLANDFord at a tolerable figure. “Wit
regard to endowments, what he proposed was, to alter the provisions of
the Act of 1840, so that no Bishop of an old see should have less than
4000l. a-year, instead of 4200l. a-year.” This proposed reduction in
d|the price of Bishops will not be more than proportionate to the general
diminution in the cost of commodities; indeed, should it take place, it
is by no means certain that the Right Reverend Bench will not still be
considered to present rather an exception to the general rule of cheap-
ness. A descent to a minimum of 4000l. a-year cannot be regarded as
any very tremendous fall in prelates. Should the BLANDFord tariff be
adopted, the superior sorts of Bishop will still command considerable
“He further proposed that the income of the future ARch-
Bishop of CANTERBURY shall be reduced to 10,000l.; of the future
ARCHBishop of York, to 8000l.; of the Bishop of London, to 6000l.;
and of the Bishops of WINches.TER and DURHAM, to 5000; it is
hence obvious that the tendency of Bishops is still to create a high rate
of interest, and º there may be some prospect of their conversion,
it is not likely that the change will be of so violent a character as to
justify any very serious alarm on the part of the Church.
A VERY OPEN QUESTION.
THE papers have lately been sprinkled with little notes from anony.
mous little people, intimating that little shocks of earthquakes have beer.
experienced, in certain little villages. Among others we have been
edified by the account of the waving of the earth about the Mendip
Hills, which was distinctly noticed by an astounded º: who, for
a few moments, was rendered doubtful as to which of his extremities he
stood upon. The gardener's state of mystification is shared by his
master, who, having detected a crack in his whitewashed ceiling,
declares the evidence of an earthquake to be irresistible. For our
own parts, until we have proof that the earthquake has swallowed some-
thing—even a stray cow, an errant, donkey, or, an unlucky dog—we
must be excused for declining to swallow the earthquake.

THE POOR MAN'S DOUB LE KNOCK
ARK! there it is, that ſaint sound
—I heard it once before :
I’m positive that some one
is knocking at the door :
When first it came, it doubt-
less by noisy cabs was
drown'd; -
If knockers were to whisper,
like that would be the
sound.
And yet the knock is double;
deny it those who can,
That he who gave it must be
a sort of gentleman,
Although it was so timid,
that I can answer for’t,
The gentleman who gave it
was only of a sort.
How fearless is the postman!
the very stoutest heart
At hearing his twin thunders,
is ever forced to start.
How fearless is the cabman,
who stops the rapid wheel,
And makes **. dwelling
tremble with long-protrac-
ted peal!
How fearless the mechanic,
who comes to mend your
lock'.
Although his knock is single, there's vigour in that knock:
It smacks of independence, it speaks of rugged pride;
You feel that he will enter with firm and manly stride.
The pot-boy, too, knocks boldly, as, of his calling proud,
With voice unused to ſalter, he cries for pots aloud:
His very manner shows us he comes to claim a right,
When bawling for the pots which he left the overnight.
But, oh! that knock so lowly—what mortal can it be?
A man with a petition, or German refugee;.
Some friend of early childhood, who went with me to school,
And now has turn'd out badly—has proved a knave or fool.
How dully through the passage the sound appears to sneak!-
Genteel, although so humble;—though double, yet so weak:
The pomp of better days, which 't were wiser to forget,
The dark and abject present, within that sound have met.
The undertaker's hammer can smite the very soul;
The bells for those we bury, oppress us with their toll;
But of all dismal noises which human feelings shock,
The dismallest is, surely, the Poor Man's Double Knock.
Spanish Accounts.
A SPANIsh paper, named the Epoca, which does not explain its
ambiguous language, states that M. Fould, who has been residing for
some time in Madrid, had made advantageous propositions to the
Government relative to the floating debt. It is to be feared that there
are but two ways of dealing with a floating debt likely to be adopted by
the Spanish Government. One would be to dissipate, or dissolve, the
debt in the floating medium: the other, which probably would be
referred, would be that of adding to the floating debt and increasing
its weight—with a view to sink it.
TRUE PROTECTIONIST FIGURES.
. The most valuable Protectionist figures are those that are stationed
in corn-fields to frighten the birds, away, as they at least consist of
genuine rags and real straw, and do actually serve the purpose of
protection to agriculture.
THE Swallow , or THE BRITIs H. PUBLIc-An eminent M.D.

A Sweering REFORMER.—The new LoRD, CHANCELIOR is setting
so vigorously to work to sweep away the abuses of Chancery, that
the lawyers declare he is quite “a new BROUGHAM” (broom).
A ROYAL CORRESPONDENCE.
“It is all very well, Mr. Punch,” writes a Liberal, who dates from
the “Congenial Club,” “to pitch into the poor KING of DAHomey; but
I have just returned from the other side of the Alps, and, I confess, I
have seen kings there who have nothing better than the said African
monarch about them—except their dinners. Are you aware that they
carry on the Slave-trade just as much in the Bay of Naples as in the
Bight of Benin P At all events, º: make slaves of people for the
purposes of gain, isn't it just as bad as selling them outright P*
Our enthusiastic young friend proceeds with his declamation, and
wants to palm off upon us the following letter from KING BoMBA as a
genuine one—addressed to the QUEEN OF ENGLAND, under the ho
that a Tory Government will help him in the cause of despotism. e
are not acquainted with BoMBA’s hand—nor do we wish to be better
acquainted with that paternal fist—but the epistle in question, is,
perhaps, not unworthy of his heart and head, if not thoroughly genuine.
“KING BoMBA To THE GREAT QUEEN OF GREAT BRITAIN
AND IRELAND.
“KING, BoMBA very much want make friend with English Govern.
ment. Him always in danger from him people. They make plenty row,
and he no always able keep them quiet. BoMBA much want plenty
cowries.
...; time ago, BoMBA’s ancestor get made King Naples. Many
time hol feast-tºlenty fighting. Now-a-days, everywhere missionary
come—call him liberal—he say not alway killee de people now ! People
no ought to be slave. People ought be well fed-be made readee and
writee. What for—Bomba want know? What for people no slave?
'spose KING BoMBA want sell 'em P
“BoMBA require plenty powder and shot. When Sicily Island go
make the disturbance, BoMBA 'bliged makee de war and kill 'em. Then,
how keep up prison,’spose no have plenty cowries? Prison not cost
very much—pack him prisoner close—but must have some cowries.”
We scarcely know whether this touching appeal may hope for success,
supposing—for we have hinted our suspicions—that it isn't a hoax,
But, after all, it isn't such a very improbable document. A white
tyrant only differs from a black one in colour; the difference is merely
superficial. To be sure, the black one eats his subjects, as well as kills
them; but this fact, while it proves he has an equally bad heart, only
proves that he has a better digestion than his royal contemporary.
THE BOOKSELLERS DEFYING COMPETITION."
Should the principle of unlimited competition be adopted by the
booksellers, there is no doubt that considerable briskness will be im-
parted to their business. A great extension of their shop-fronts, will
ensue, and across the spacious window-panes of the enterprising
bibliopoles will be pasted huge placards announcing ten, twenty, or
forty millions of pounds worth of literary property to be disposed of at
a quarter price. “All these MACAULAY's at 6d. ' " will be inscribed
on one label: on another we shall see, “Best Waverley Novels
only 104d. ' ' " with an enormous 10d, and a very small A. In the
windows of such establishments as MEssrs. RivingtoN's, the Fathers
and the Bishops will be ticketed, like berthes and pisites; and we shall
be attracted the announcement of “Tremendous Fall in Öxford
Tracts,” or “Great Reduction in HookERs.”
“You’ll meet Me, Won't You?”
This “extraordinary and lovely ballad” [see Advertisement] is de-
scribed with such refreshing naïveté by our mythical contemporary, the
Musical Review, that we really feel compelled to notice it. . On its own
apocryphal judgment, this fabulous authority states that “a pretty
conceit lurks in every stanza: the melody is, ravishing.”. Now, really,
we think this is one of the most appropriately-worded bits of criticism
we ever read in our life; for, truly, the gentleman who could, even
lyrically, address a lady with such audacious assurance, must indeed be
"pretty conceit-ed.”

Pius Hard Up.
A CoRREspondent of the Times writing from Rome,
says that the Jews will not lend the Pope .# money.
The Tablet, perhaps, will compare the British public to the
Jews, because it refuses to give his Holinessſany credit.
Certainly we should not like to discount the Papal paper.
POLITICAL CAPITAL.
. THERE are different varieties of “Political Capital,” some of which is
in but little demand, and the remainder in no demand whatever.
The Political Capital of the Protectionist, is at, present very small;
but he is endeavouring to increase it by trying whether he cannot get
a penny or two extra out of every quartern loaf. It is very .#.
however, whether the country will allow him to raise his Political
Capital in this way, as it ºld have to pay rather too dearly for the
increase.
The Political Capital of the Whig seems generally to be the Political
Capital of others. He trades with this, borrowing a little from one
party, and a little from another, until he purchases his way gradually
into power; but once in H. the country soon discovers the poverty
of his resources, and is glad to#. rid of him at any price.
The Political Capital of the Young Englander seems to be very little
more than a White Waistcoat; and, as all, Political Capitalists will
shortly have to face the country, we suppose the Young Englander puts
on his White Waistcoat to enable him to make a clean breast as to the
investment of his Capital.
The Political Capital of the Free-Trader is simply a Cheap Loaf. If a
Government is raised by means of such Capital, we think that every
poor man will be too happy to subscribe to it.
In our humble opinion, the latter is the only Political Capital for
which there is likely to be any demand at the forthcoming election.
All classes, we prophecy, will be anxious to take a share in it, as it is
a source of investment in which the principal not only is safe, but the
interest morally certain.
Cruel to a Hair.
Louis, NAPQIEoN has issued a degree commanding all professors of
Universities, Colleges, Lyceums, and other * of instruction, to cut
of their beards and moustaches, lest they be confounded with
“demagogues and agitators of society.” Considering how he has
bearded the French people, he may well shave their teachers.
FALLEN GREATNESS.
CoLoREL SIBTHoRP declared, somewhat superfluously, and very
emphatically, the other night, in the House of Commons, that he had
never been inside the Crystal Palace. We think we can go further, and
say, that, as none of the windows º; to have been mischievously
brºken, the probability is that the gallant Colonel has not only never
been inside the building, but that he has never been even within a
stone's throw of it. In avoiding any approximation to the Crystal
Palace, we think the Honourable Member has shown his discretion;
for, had he looked on the hated glass, and a pebble fallen in his way,
he might have been tempted to carry his animosity to a most unwar-
rantable pitch.

THEORY OF
THE SEA-SERPENT.
TTESTATIONS of the
sea-serpent's existence
by persons who declare
that they have seen
that ſº monster,
are so frequent that
they give us a very
humiliating idea of the
character of our species
for veracity; for, if
honest tars, as seamen
are called, can relate
such fictions, what sort
of regard for truth can
be expected of terres-
trial individuals? what
arewe to be considered,
in short, for the most
art, but a set of lying
Fº Thereis,
however, good reason
to hope that sailors are
not, in general, wilfully
lmposing upon us in
4 these º, Real
objects often assume a
strange appearance at
sea. The Times, in a
leading article the other day, alluded to the famous case of the Pulcan:
“Which was bringing home despatches from the Cape, but overstayed her time two months, or some
trifle of that sort, which was taken in tow by another Government steamer, which was taken in
tow by a third, as her engines, too, had broken down.”
A fleet of broken-down Government steamers, with their masts and chimneys
gone, all in tow, might, in a haze, be easily mistaken for an enormous reptile :
and thus we can understand how mariners may very often imagine that they have
seen the sea-serpent.
FAMINF AMONG THE FARMERS.
THE Agricultural Interest was, a short time ago, said to be in a desperate
state, but there is every reason to believe it is worse off now. When the farmers
were º as being in the direst distress, we still were º coln-
forted by hearing that they had dined. We know that, if not every day, at
least once a week or so, they enjoyed, here and there, a moderate and frugal
repast of turtle and Jullienne soup, turbot and lobster sauce, salmon—which was
perhaps even grillé en papillotes—haunch of venison, Dartmoor mutton, or common
roast sirloin, and the other coarser varieties of butchers’ meat; poultry, accom-
panied, it might be, by the simple condiment of Béchamel sauce; a few entrées,
such as cótelettes de mouton a la Soubise; with the slight addition of fricasseed
lobsters, stewed mushrooms, oyster patties, curries, noir de veau a lºoseille; and
a few other pretty, but plain, little tiny kickshaws; as partridges, snipes, pigeons
a la Macédoine, leverets, wild-ducks, cabinet, plum, soufflé, and iced pudding, Char-
lotte Russe, blancmange, tipsy cake, jellies, creams, Bavaraise en gélée, and such-
like homely belly-timber—none of your foreigneering delicacies-succeeded by a
dessert of sound wholesome pine-apples, melons, grapes, peaches, and apricots, mixed
with almond cakes and iced creams; solid substantial fare, washed down with good
hearty draughts of sensible sterling Champagne, Moselle, Sherry, Madeira, Port,
Claret, Burgundy, with no further luxury than nappy ale. This was pretty fair living.
It was somewhat ascetic: still it allayed the cravings of hunger, and, perhaps, con-
tributed in some measure to nutrition. Such a moderate collation, whilst the
Whigs were in power, the poor farmers did occasionally contrive to enjoy in the
refectory of some monastic hotel; but now their own friends, the Protectionists,
have succeeded to office, we never hear of their dining at all, and have no reason
to suppose that they take any food whatever, beyond the meagre domestic
allowance of five meals a day. May their shadows never, be less; but under a
Protectionist Government, it does not seem likely that their backs will get very
much broader.
Court (and Alley) Circular.
THERE was, on Saturday last, an Investiture of the most Honourable Order of
the Warm Bath, at which one Knight—Grand Crossing-Sweeper—was in
attendance. He was without his collar. The officers present were Scrubbing-
Brush-at-Arms—and Legs—with Soft-Soap in waiting. Cabman in ordinary was
also in attendance, wearing the leather and badge of his order. Knight Grand
Crossing-Sweeper was introduced to the Bath by an officer of Engineers; and the
*::::: the day was subjected to a species of Hero Wash-up, equally novel and
salubrious.
Punch's PEERAGE.--To the Editor of Notes and Queries. Was the title of Lord

DON'T SING, JOHANNAH.
Suggested by the popular Negro Melody, “Don't cry, Susannah.”
I’M cheated, in a manner,
With a contract on my knee;
But they’re trying to trepan her,
As the public, sure, must see.
In black and white it was all right—
This treatment’s not the thing;
To terms with me you did agree,
Johannah! won’t you sing?
Oh, Johannah I won't you sing for me?
I’m going to SIR JAMEs PARKER upon my bended knee.
I jump'd on board a steamer,
And floated down de ribber,
And fifty pounds a night (too much ')
I did agree to gib her.
She wanted more—she ran to Gye;
'Twas not at all the thing;
I scarcely could believe my eye:
Johannah, won't you sing?
Oh, Johannah won’t you sing for me?
I’m going to SIR JAMEs PARKER upon my bended knee.
I had a dream de odernight,
When everything was still;
I thought that Covent Garden
Johannah did not fill.
The public did not like her voice;
No º she did bring;
sº I, “My dear, go home again:
ohannah | don't you sing!”
Oh, Johannah don’t you sing for me!
I shall be glad to terminate the contract on my knee,
Now, when I go abroad again,
I mean to look around,
And see if more Johannahs
Are nowhere to be found.
For, useless they who overboard
Willian engagement fling;
For when she was relied upon,
Johannah would not sing.
Oh, Johannah | don't you sing for me!
i’il find a prima donna who will less fickie be.
A WORTHY INSTANCE.
IN speaking of the recent judgment by which the Court
of First Instance in the department of the Seine has
declared itself “competent” to deal with the Orleans
Confiscation, the Times rightly remarks that—
“This is the first public act of anybody of men in France since the
2nd of December, to remind the world that law has not altogether lost
its force in that country, and that, however absolute political power may
have become, there is still a bar to defend public rights, and judicial
authority to define and enforce public obligations.”
The Tribunal in question is therefore fitly named. Its
title will be henceforth pregnant with a deep historical
significance, mutely reminding us of this great present
act—this memorable “First Instance” of Right resisting
rampant Might, and of Justice contravening firmly the
absolute Imperial will. -
The name is significant, too, in yet another light, and
we wonder that the Government advisers were apparently
so blind to it. A glance would have shown them that the
line of argument they used was anomalous and absurd.
For how, in reason, could it be contended that the judges
legally were bound to declare themselves “incompetent,”
ºf: the question stood referred expressly to a Tribunal
of the Sane?
The Present State of Parties.
The present Parliament, after all, is not so aristocratic
as it has been generally represented to be. It may be
divided into two parties—the High Bred Party and the
Low Bred Party. - - - -
The HIGH BRED Party is the Protectionist Party, which
goes in for dear Bread, at Protectionist prices. -
The Low BRED. Party is the Free Trade Party, which
goes in for cheap Bread at Free Trade prices.

PERFORMANCE OF OUR FRIEND SIBBY IN THE LOBBY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, AFTER THE DECISION
TO PULL DOWN THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
“SUCH A GETTING UP-STAIRS.”
It used to be thought that the Court of Chancery was a fatally easy
place to find one's way into, but a dreadfully difficult one to find one's
way out of. Let us hope that in losing the former characteristic, it has
lost the latter, also. For now, as we learn from the Law reports in the
daily papers, the Vice-Chancellors have been established in such inac-
cessible quarters in the new Palace at Westminster, that judges,
counsel, solicitors, and suitors have the most, serious difficulty in
getting into them at all. One of the judges has lately been “taking a
rule to compute” the number of steps up to his Court, and pronounces
them to be eighty, and a witness, of eighty-four, being wanted for some
purpose or other, his counsel had tº pray that a commission might
issue to examine him down-stairs, he being totally incapable of getting
up the legal ladder to the cockloft in which poor THEMIs has been
pushed by MR. BARRY. As to the wretched juniors, their legal lives
are become a perpetual “motion of course,” and the mere finding the
Courts is become so difficult as almost to require a bill of discovery.
Now we have no objection that, as Chancery is, the accesses to its
Courts should be made as uninviting as possible; but when our system
of Equity is reformed, we should recommend that her seats should be
transferred to the ground floor, unless MR. BARRY's ingenuity can
manage an ascending room like that which used to raise Colosseum-
visitors to the Panorama of London.
We believe that this “Winding-up Act” would be a great relief both
to Court and suitors. Only, instead of the sum of sixpence, which
used to be paid for that easy ascent, we should propose a reduction of
the charge to twopence, and that a Crier of the Court should be stationed
at the door, to announce to clients—
“Two-pence more, and Up Goes the Donkey.”
MACADAMIZATION IN A CHURCHYARD.
The North British Daily Mail contains the paragraph following:-
“A gravestone in Middlesborough churchyard was broken and defaced last week, by
order of the “pastor, the Rev. M.R. PEEL, because the full amount agreed to be given to
him for allowing it to be placed there, had not been paid.”
SHARspeaRE says that there are sermons in stones. From a frag-
ment of the vestone, described to have been broken as above,
perhaps it would be possible to extract an edifying homily on avarice.
It is rather scandalous that “pastors” should derive a part, of their
living from fees for the erection of memorials in churchyards. This
reduces the “pastor” or “shepherd” to a level with the sheep that
are sometimes turned into those consecrated precincts, and fatten
themselves by grazing over the dead.
A Thing Difficult to Imagine.
In one of the late astronomical accounts, the writer, warming with
his subject, says, “there is at present, visible on the sun's disc a fine
group of spots.” We hope we are not destitute of imagination; but, for
the life of us, we cannot º: “a fine group of spots.” The astronomer
a
in question must have looked at the sun with the eye of a Macassar.
THE PEOPLE AND THEIR PALACE.

Was en-ti-a-ly owing to that foolish act.
Wha-evaw they put it a cwowd it will dwaw,
And that is the weason I think it a baw;
I have no gweat dislike to the building, as satch;
The People is what I object to sa match.
The People !—I weally am sick of the wawd :
The People is ugly, unpleasant, absawd;
Wha-evaw they go, it is always the case,
They are shaw to destwo, all the chawm of the place.
Their voices are loud, and their laughter is hawse;
Their featyaws are faby, iwegulaw, cawse;
How seldom it is that their faces disclose,
What one can call, pvopally speaking, a nose!
They have dull heavy looks, which appeaw to expwess
Disagweeable stwuggles with common distwess;
The People can't dwess, doesn't know how to walk,
And would uttaly wuin a spot like the Pawk.
That I hate the People is maw than I’ll say;
I only would have them kept out of my way.
Let them stay at the pothouse, wejoice in the pipe,
And wegale upon beeaw, baked patatas, and twipe.
We must have the People—of that tha's no doubt—
In shawt they could not be, pahaps, done without.
If 'twa not faw the People we could not have Boots.
Tha’s no doubt that they exawcise useful pasuits.
They are all vewy well in their own pyopa spheeaw,
A ºf distance off; but I don't like them neeaw;
The slams is the place faw a popula show;
Don't encouwage the People to spoil Wotten Wow.

As to twy and pvesawve the Glass House on its site,

OBTAINING MONEY ON ELECTRO-BIOLOGICAL
PRETENCES.
ERTAIN philosophers are going
about the town and country,
performing experiments in what
they call “Electro-Biology,” on
persons who are, in the language
of their announcements, “in a
perfectly wakeful state.” The
experiments consist in causing
the subjects of them to imagine
various things, and to mistake
these fancies for realities. Of
a truth, the Profes-
sors of Electro-Bio-
logy can, it would
appear, make some
persons, who are not
asleep, though at the
same time they are
hardly wide awake,
S the victims of the
--- most extraordinary
delusions. In the
Times, a few days
since, appearedanad-
vertisement, headed
“ELECTRo - BIo-
* Logy,” informing the
public that—
R. — begs to announce that he will form a CLASS for INSTRUCTION
in this SCIENCE, at the –, on Wednesday, May 5, at 12 o'clock. The whole
will be given in one lesson, which will be £1.1s.
Electro-biology thus appears to be a science—or perhaps it would be
more correct to say an art—by which it is possible to extract money,
in some quantity, from people's pockets. Such individuals, however,
must be peculiarly constituted; their pecuniary substance largely pre-
ponderating over, their cerebral development. The whole secret of
Electro-biology, elsewhere charged a guinea for, shall be given in this
present number of Punch for threepence, with an abundance of other
information in the highest degree instructive and equally entertainin
into the bargain. A lot of people have each of them a disc of zinc an
copper placed in the palm of the hand, and are set to stare at it, or
to stare, simply at the palm of the hand, or the end of a walking-stick,
or a fiddle-stick,-in short, at any fixed object. It appears that, after
they have continued staring in this manner some time, a certain number
of them will be found to have stared themselves out of their senses.
In this state, their minds, naturally perhaps not strong, are so com-
F. under the control of the directors of the process, that whatever
e suggests to them in a confident tone, they believe. What is strange,
and no less deplorable, is, that in a popular assembly the number of
those who are so susceptible of this delusive influence is so great.
The fact is psychologically interesting, as indicating how large is the
impressible or, gullible portion of the human species; and helping us
to account, philosophically, for faith in MAHOMET, IRVING, Thom,
Agapemonians, Addoloratas, Estaticas, and winking Images.

The Cry of the Protectionist.
THE poor Protectionist has, since Protection has been so cruelly

he will probably be crying out for another kind of Protection, and his
cry henceforth will be, “Protect me from my friends.”

MARRIAGE IN HIGH LIFE-A FASHIONABLE NOVEL.
In Three Columns, folio, by JENKINs.
LONG time has elapsed since
the genius of JENKINs has
found such a theme for his
pen as the marriage of the
youngest daughter of the
DUCHEss or SUTHERLAND.
It is difficult to throw much
passion into a paragraph de-
scriptive of a thé dansante,
or to hang the wild flowers
of poesy upon such a peg as
the “Arrivals at Mºjº.
Hotel; ” but the marriage
alluded to above has seized
JENKINs by the shoulder-
knot, and shaken him out of
the drowsiness into which he
had lately fallen. Any one
who peruses the work now
under review will rise from
the treat with a thorough
conviction that JENKINs has lost none of that soft, plush-like tone of
sentiment, that delicate tracery of gold lace, and that cocked-hat-like
intedness of observation that have formed, as it were, the literary
ivery by which the works of the same hand may be generally recog-
nised. The opening passage is artistically, arranged; for, like a
common-place street-door passage, it has nothing to arrest the atten-
tion—nothing, in fact, for the imagination of the reader to stop at,
or to tumble over. The passage is simply introductory to the outside
of the Chapel Royal, which we find described as a “great point of
attraction,” guarded only by a “necessarily obdurate verger,” whose
character is very beautifully, though briefly, shadowed out to us... This
officer is touchingly represented with a human and an official side, be-
tween which a struggle is kept up with such tact that, at the moment
when we are expecting the man to give way, for the purpose of
throwing open the Chapel doors, the verger stands before us in a state
of “obduracy,” which JENKINs, by describing as “necessary,” has
artistically redeemed from utter hatefulness. -
With a disregard of the unities which only genius can dare to show,
we are suddenly hurried from place to place, and the Pegasus, which
has just pulled up opposite the Chapel Royal, whirls us, with all the
impetuosity of a runaway cab, to the front of Stafford House. Here
we find a touch of comedy to relieve the more serious interest of the
work, for we are informed that “the period appointed for the ceremon
was one o'clock—a fact not generally known, in consequence of whic
the spectators assembled at a much earlier hour.” There is a sly, quiet
humour in all this, which proves the writer to be quite as much at home
in the cap of MoMUs, as in the black worsted wig of MELPoMENE.
Happily, the misguided public enjoyed their own discomfiture, for,
“the crowd,” says JENKINs, “bore the delay with great good temper.”
We are next introduced to some of the guests; and, in the announce-
ment of the arrival of the carriages, JENKINs, of course feeling
himself at home, proceeds, with characteristic volubility. The open-
ing of the hall-door for the admission of the company, enables
the author to get a better view of the inside of the house than
he has yet enjoyed, dependent as he must hitherto have been on
a glimpse through the area rails, or a few stray peeps, cut short
continually by the Police, through the unguarded key-hole. ºf
rapidly to account the opportunity of getting a glimpse at the hall,
JENKiNs catches a sight of the pillars supporting the roof, and in a
moment he finds the subject for a passage of rare poetic beauty, in
which he speaks glowingly of “Plinths,” decorated “with masses of
verdant moss, thickly starred with primroses.” There is something bold
and novel in the idea of putting stars upon moss, which, being a pro-
duction of the earth, suggests the startling figure of the world turned
upside down, with the stars on the ground, or the moss in the sky;
an alternative which JENKINs, when he has ascertained whether he is
upon his head or his heels, will, perhaps, make choice of.
...Our author now penetrates further than the hall; and we accompany
him to the banqueting-room, where his poetic eye darts upon an object
which he has thus immortalised:—
. “In the centre,” says JENKINs, “rising from a settee, sprang a
igantic group of lilies, and other appropriate emblems.” What a new
fact in botany, do we thus acquireſ We learn that a, “lily” is an
“appropriate object” to a “settee”—a truth we should as soon have
º. to be told, as that a crop of parsley would look natural
at home, springing out of no other bed than a feather-bed.
. After taking us on tip-toe to the door of the
inviting us to take a peep at “two circular seats o
P.º. and
honour”—a some-
what circuitous phrase for a pair of music-stools—JENKINs hurries the
reader to the landing, where “the bride was seen descending the grand
staircase, resting on the arm of her noble father.”
At this point of the º JENKINs seems to have been
detected as an intruder; for the next paragraph or chapter of his novel
commences with the intimation, that “the scene outside the mansion
was a curious one”—a passage graphically indicative of a sudden change
in the author's whereabouts. “From an early hour in the morning,” he
continues, “many of the humbler friends of the noble family had taken
up their stations near the porch;” and among these “humbler friends,”
we now seem to see JENKINs patiently clinging round the eligible stem
of a friendly lamp-post. . Notwithstanding the obvious reverse of cir-
cumstances the writer has clearly experienced—notwithstanding the
change of position—JENKINs never allows his shirt-front to be ruffled by
any indignant swelling of the bosom ; for he adds, that “the greatest
good-humour, however, prevailed.” The word “Lowever” shadows forth
more touchingly than any direct terms of complaint could convey, the fine
sense of wounded dignity that JENKINs mentally groans under. He is
no longer in the hall, or on the staircase! He is among “the humbler
friends of the noble family, near the porch.” His post is not by any
means the post of honour; but “the greatest good-humour, however,
prevailed.”
In this trying position he joins in the “cheers of welcome" of the
rest of the mob as the bride goes forth from her home, and, sinking
the wounded flunkey in the gamin, we find him one of the first of the
“boys” in a rush to the Chapel Royal. Here we catch another glimpse
of à. stern yet tender, verger—the, “necessarily obdurate” but
naturally yielding—with a heart of Portland stone and putty; a being
whose humanity might be turned with a straw, but whose sense of
duty is not to be stunned by a crowbar, and who would inevitably have
let in the crowd pell-mell from Pall Mall, but for the fact that “his
instructions were peremptory;” and thus by not being less than verger,
he became somewhat more than man. Excluded from the Chapel,
JENKINs has an opportunity of describing the dresses of some of the
visitors; and he has been particularly attracted by the bonnet of a
Duchess, which enables him to display his proficiency in the French
language; for he learnedly describes the article as a paille de fantaisie,
instead of descending to i. vulgar term of “fancy straw.” -
With a grasp of mind worthy of that which dashes “25,000 bonnets”
into a single window, JENKINs proceeds to play with the head-dresses
of the company in a strain of luxuriant richness that is rarely met
with even “in the limits of an advertisement.” He playfully alludes
to one as “an elegant hat;” another he touches off lightly as “a bonnet
of tulle; ” while a third he gloriously pictures as “particularly novel,
being composed of white lace, jºi. with green and white
grass.” e have already seen how JENKINs can put stars upon moss
and otherwise change the face of nature, so that we are not unprepared
for his introduction of an article, we are justified, in labelling as
“quite new,” in the shape of “white grass.” Whether Nature will
ever adopt the idea which JENKINs has been so generous as to
suggest to her, may be doubtful; but in the mean time “white grass”
seems to be a fait accompli as far as the productions of fashion are
concerned.
We will not follow the author back to the mansion; nor will we
join with him in his conversations with the tradesmen who supplied
some of the wedding presents, and whose addresses are paraded at full
length—the grateful consequence of such conversation—in the body of
our author's work; but we will hurry with him to the dénouement, in
which we find him appearing in a new and somewhat startling character.
No longer the “humble friend” of the noble family “at the porch,”—the
hanger-on of the house by its nearest lamp-post-we trace the devoted
JENKINs as the “enthusiastic attendant,” who, “with a mixed feeling
of kindness, humour, and .." rushed from behind the stalwart
porter as the carriage drove off, and threw an old shoe for luck after
the receding pair.” Such devotion ought not to go without its reward;
for the man who leaves himself without a shoe to his foot, has well
earned the wages of a flunkeyism, so unsurpassingly ridiculous as to
tread almost on the heels of the sublime.
POETRY IN PARLIAMENT.
SPEAKING in favour of MR. CoRDEN's proposed amendment to the
Militia Bill, M.R. BRIGHT is reported to have said,
“In his boyhood he remembered that the cry was for reliance upon ‘the wooden
walls of Old England,' and poets made songs ond odes of all kinds on the subject,
such as–
“‘Britannia needs no bulwarks,
No towers along the steep ;
Her march is o'er the mountain wave,
Her home is on the deep.'”
Thy pardon, good friend BRIGHT. With all due deference to thy
judgment as touching poetry, not many kinds of odes and songs were
made at the time thou alludest to, or indeed have ever been made, such
as the noble lines wherewith thou art represented to have embellished
thine oration.

beforehand, and # either is wounded, it is the opponent always who
insists upon paying the expenses. But they have so great a delicacy
in wounding each other, that the duel is sometimes protracted for hours
at a time; so that when they are too exhausted to continue any
longer, they will quietly stop and smoke a cigar together, and then go
on fighting again as if nothing had occurred. - - - -
Aj. Huissier does not come down suddenly upon his victim as
an English Sheriff's Officer does, but writes to him the previous day,
to give him notice he is going to arrest him, and he hopes he will so
far oblige him as to keep out of the way. -
When there is an execution in France, an audible shudder runs
through the kingdom, from one end to the other.
The man who breaks an oath is universally shunned as a monster,
i. # ºf temptation offered itself, wouldn't scruple to break a child's
ything!
p If Louis NAPOLEoN was to be tried for high treason to-morrow, and
convicted, I doubt if a single Frenchman could be found to execute the
sentence upon him. - -
There are no butchers º speaking, in France. ...The little
innocent calves are killed by chloroform; the sheep fall lifeless in a
minute before the galvanic battery, and the oxen die comparatively
happy, being asphyxiated at the abattoirs, by the friendly agency of
Charcoal. -- - - -
You never see a paper-knife in France, but it is made either of ivory
or wood!
If a Frenchman at the Theatre wants to cough or to sneeze, he
always goes outside to do it. -
You may be in a French Caſ; for hours, and you will never hear any
intolerant noise, nor. horrible asseverations, nor a single injurious
epithet. Everything is as friendly, as quiet, as a family wedding.
IF, the EMPEROR OF Russia with his army of Cossacks was to
knock at five o'clock this evening at the gates of Paris, and demand
admission, I really believe, such is the Frenchman's horror of war,
that ST. A.RNAUD would wait upon him, and presenting his sword,
exclaim—"Entree, non brace.”
As for invading England, the motion is so comical to any one, who
knows the French as Ido, that it only deserves to be laughed at. Tºven
supposing such a preposterous thing was to be seriously decreed by the
present_PRESIDENT—the Frenchmen, with their well-known gallantry,
would, I am confident, insist upon a month's notice at least being given
to the Englishmen, with a request that they would be obliging enough
to appoint the day upon which they would like to receive the French.
... As for the Duke of WELLINGTON, I firmly believe he would be so
idolised, if he were to visit France, that he would find a great difficulty
in ever getting back to England again!
Editorial Intelligence.
We see advertised a little book under the title of “The Editor's Count
Court Guide.” We must say this is very complimentary to the Fourt
Estate, Does it mean that editors are so frequently in the County
Court that they need the assistance of a Guide there? or is it a timely
publication for the benefit of Protectionist Editors, who, since Protec-
tion has been flung to the winds, will be so distressed that they will be
probably making their . every day in the County Court? If
so, as it is most cowardly to attack a fallen body, we recommend the
withdrawal of the offensive epithet.
PASSAGES OF RAPID ExECUTION.
MADEMOISELLE WAGNER will execute but two musical passages, we
are afraid, in this country. The one will be her passage from Hamburgh
to London—and the other, her passage back again.
The Arabs in Paris;
Louis NAPoleon invited certain of the Arab chiefs to Paris, where
he proposed to show them how, with French hospitality, he could keep
open house. At the same time he has evinced the determination to
show, to ABD-EL-KADER how, in despite of French honour, he can
keep him.

DISCOURAGEMENT OF INDUSTRY.
A Question—of some importance to the inhabitants of the suburbs,
w: houses lie a little i. from the road—is, how travelling bell-
hangers know that their gate-bell-wires are—as they continually are-
broken, and those artificers as constantly calling to ask if they may
mend them? -
The presumption is, that when bell-wires are broken, housekeepers
have them repaired, without waiting to be solicited to do so. Is the
contrary so much the case, that it is worth, a workman's while to
examiné all the gate-bell-wires of a district on the speculation of finding
a number to mend? Or can it be that the job is cut out for himself, by
the gentleman who wants it? We commend this possibility—or rather
strong probability—to the attention of the Police.
Wonderful Unanimity.
Louis NApoleon claims the fact of no one having risen in the
Senate and protested against his Government, as a tacit acknowledg-
ment of its popularity. It is certainly very tacit, and for the best of
all good reasons—no one is allowed to speak in it.

MR. DISRAELI'S PICTURES.
M. HE. Royal Academ
i
Dinner of 1852 will,
for all time, be a great
day in Art. Among
the countless ameni-
ties and courtesies that
made the delightful at-
- I mosphere of that din-
ner-time, the compli-
mentary suggestion of
Lord John Russell
to the RIGHT HoNour-
ABLE BENJAMIN Dis-
RAELI, is safe from
* oblivion; and for this
| gratifying cause – it
has already borne the
most delicious fruit.
The EARL OF DERBY
first complimented
MR. DISRAELI, with a
graceful allusion to his
portrait, behind him.
(By-the-way, how is it that, since the success of the it. Honourable
Gentleman, he is made to look considerably handsomer than heretofore?
But, doubtless, physical beauty comes with worldly prosperity.) -
LoRD JoHN §. followed; and in his generous homage to his
opponent, paid the versatility of his genius a sweet, a touching compli-
ment. His Lordship said, -
“I ventured, last year, to observe that it was remarkable how many persons, eminent
in the arts, had succeeded in literature, and that we had no better works than those
written by painters, who at the same time were at the head of their profession; but I
stated that I had not remarked that many of those great in literary eminence had
shown similar proficiency in the art of painting.”
There is no doubt that the artist's intellect has a larger scope,
describes a wider circle, than the merely literary mind.—Goose-quills,
to some extent, compress the intellect; whereas, brains are apt to
enlarge with pig’s-bristles. We cannot account for the sympathy,
but firmly believe in it. LoRD JoHN continued:–
“MR. BURRE and Mr. MacAULAY were both famous in literature, but I do not know
that either of them could produce a picture equal to any in this room. Now, this is an
arena which
laughter); and, as he has succeeded in so many things already, I hope he will try to
succeed in the fine arts as he has done in literature, and, as I must say, he has done in
political science. (Great laughter and cheering.)
The CHANCELLOR of THE ExchequER bowed, but said nothing.
It was, however, observed by those who narrowly watched him—(and he
has of late become an object of even affectionate watchfulness)—that
he wrote a few words on a card, handed it to his footman, and imme-
diately rendered himself to the geniality of the hour.
The CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER returned home º: when
—according to his directions written in cipher on that card—he found
a studio º There were easels, canvases of all sizes, palettes,
paints, brushes—with even living models waiting in the hall ! Every.
thing that makes the happiest man. MR. DISRAELI, like an energetic
man of genius, having first burnt a very handsome proof impression of
the portrait of LoRD PALMERSTON, as a thank-offering to Lord JoHN
Russell, immediately, and before going to sleep, which is evidently
not the case with every painter—began his first picture, Yes: the
words of the late Premier were still musical—as fairy wings—in the
atmosphere. He would try to succeed in the fine arts, as he had done
in literature, and—yes—and in political science.
So rapid has been the progress of MR. DisRAEL1, that at the time
of our going to press he had absolutely dashed off a dozen pictures—
Cabinet pictures. All these years had he been full of oils, and never
knew it. He seemed to have in his soul—instantaneously transmissible
through the fingers—every colour of Harlequin's jacket: that he could
not, but acknowledge himself—privately and confidentially in the
solitude of that studio—a born political painter.
MR. PUNCH has been favoured with a private view of these pictures
of the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER; and violates no confidence
by despairingly attempting to describe them.
Portrait of Lord John Russell, in the Windsor Uniform, delivering
his sword to Lord Palmerston, as Full Militiaman of the First Bottle.
holders. That this should be the virgin subject of his untried palette,
speaks equally for the head and heart of the É. Honourable Painter:
it, however, speaks more for the artist. There is great dignity in the
manner with which LoRD JoHN resigns the sword; the feeling, assisted
by a lurking expression that seems to say, “Never mind, I shall soon
have it again.”
A Back Wiew of Mr. Alderman Solomons, as he retired from the
House of Commons.—This is handled with great felicity of touch; the
J. remains open for the Chancellon of The Exchequer (cheers and
r
distance is beautifully marked: indeed, as with some of the pictures of
REMBRANDT, the obscurity seems to deepen as we look upon it. We
absolutely gaze upon the receding form of the ejected Hebrew, until
it seems to depart clean out of the picture; but this, of course, is a
delusion.
Wild Oats — A Portrait of Benjamin Disraeli, as he appeared at
Marylebone between Joseph Hume and Daniel O’Connell.—The artist
has shown ſº courage, and no less humour, in this bold, this
stinging work. He has painted himself as very young, indeed, with a
face green and immature as a very early peascod. He looks the incar-
nation of innocence; whilst his sponsors seem interchanging glances,
as much as to say, “We’ve got him 1" Nevertheless, with all the
innocence lying on the face of BENJAMIN, like dew upon a daisy, we
cannot feel quite so certain of the fact.
Portrait of the Earl of Derby as Plenty.—This picture is well
begun; but—as the head alone is finished, and the cornucopia
merely rubbed in—Punch cannot, as a critic of conscience, say what
will come of it.
Thrown Orerboard.—This will be a very bold picture: a ship in a
tempest, with somebody being thrown overboard: we cannot at present
decide, whether the subject is sacred or profane; whether the victim
will be Protection or JonAH.
The British Farmer with his Nose out of Joint, is merely rubbed in ;
ºil no doubt be elaborately finished by the Right Honourable
1SU,
We confess to one little bit of treachery. Ere quitting the studio, we
turned one canvas from the wall, and found sketched upon it the out-
lines of “A Statue of BENJAMIN DISRAELI,” with his back “towards
Mark Lane, and his face towards the Caucasus.”
A NEW CONWIWIAL SONGSTER.
WE have plenty of drinking songs, but no eating songs, and we do
not see why the latter should not be substituted for the former, now
that the practice of sitting over one's wine is nearly exploded, and the
table owes much less to the bottle than to the bottle-jack. Conviviality,
as far as liquids are concermed, is virtually at an end, and therefore,
unless the solids can be converted into subjects of harmony, we fear that
the separation between hospitality and a song will become unavoidable.
We are desirous of doing what we can to promote the harmony of the
festive board, and beginning, therefore, with a sort of compromise
between the fluids and the substantials, we have selected Soup, as a
theme, upon which we may meet half-way the drinkers and the eaters,
who may wish to combine song with a satisfaction of their appetites.
AIR-"Come, send round the Wine.”
Come, serve out the Soup—'tis my honest belief,
That those who reject it are obstinate fools;
The time that's allowed is by far too brief
To be wasted in etiquette's idle rules.
Your Soup may be Turtle and mine may be Pea,
But while they are served at the same gay board,
The fool who would quarrel that both don't agree,
Deserves not to stay if the party is bored.
Shall I ask the gay gourmand who sits at my side,
Imbibing a basin of splendid Ox-Tail,
To give up the soup he has tasted and tried,
Because to discover its virtues I fail?
From the rich calipash am I ask'd to refrain,
Because to some tastes it comes rather amiss?
No! perish the notion: so, help me again;
No other soup reaches a standard like this.
Handsome Compliment to Rosas.
THE proprietors of the Zoological Gardens have, in the handsomest
manner, sent a free admission to Rosas to attend the feeding time of
the tigers. There was a laudable endeavour made to stimulate the
appetite of the boa, to swallow, in honour of our distinguished guest, a
live kid; but reptiles are so wayward, the creature would neither be
coaxed nor threatened; and so the fête stands over.
“The EAR OF THE NATION." Is A VERY DEAF on E.
A For EIGNER, speaking of the House of Commons, says: “So diffi-
cult is it for anything to be heard inside its gorgeous walls, that the
impatient Members are obliged to be continually calling out, “Hear !
Hear! Hear!’”
AN UNPUBLISHED MAXIM OF THE LATE MRs. TRIMMER.—A dull
boy, if you will allow me, may be likened to a lamp, which becomes all
the brighter occasionally for a little trimming.

ANATOMY OF A MAJORITY.
For THE REMoval of The CRYSTAL PALACE.
RIGHT, JoHN.—A gentleman
of liberality; advocate of
popular rights, man of the
people, and all that sort
of matter.
CABBELL, BENJAMIN Bond.

dinner, with the "QUEEN,

CHANDos, MARQUEss of.-
Son of a duke, and there:
fore thinks the Crystal
Palace an invasion on the
Row of Rotten.
Co B DEN, Rich ARD.—
Thinks Crystal very well,
and would vote for it, if the Crystal were only Cotton.
DisBAELI, BENJAMIN.—ls a Minister, says “No ;” and shall say no
more.
DRUMMOND, Home.—Is not a Minister; but has always thought-
still thinks—and will continue to think the Crystal Palace an
infernal bore.
GRANBy, MARQUEss of.-Believes the Palace, if kept, an invasion upon
public faith.
Hººgºolar-know. exactly what that means, as all England
Salull.
InGLIs, SIR Robert.—Is of opinion that the Palace would make the
ower orders forget their Bishops and their Church.
MANNERs, Lord John.—Asks who in the world is the People; but
begs that old Nobility may not be left in the lurch.
MoLesworth, SIR WILLIAM.–As the Editor of Hobbes, says the
People shall not even have Hobson’s choice. -
SEYMoUR, Lord.—Declares, certainly not; and that is his most
decided, and his º most exclusive voice.
Sibthorp, Colon EL.-"Crystal Palace l’—“Hail-storm 1"—“Brick
bats!”—“Blazes l’”—“Lightning !”—“Thunder!”
Spoon ER, Richard.—Begs the Colonel will not swear; but as for the
Crystal Palace, that must knock under.
Qther reasons were given—all equally good, and all equally stringent—
Which the givers, Punch hopes, will discover, on the General Election
that's contingent.
“GOOD FAITH.”
THE present Government are most heroically anxious to keep “good
ſaith.” They wanted to preserve the Crystal Palace, but “good
faith” did not allow them. †: this “good faith” is flung
like a big stone against the building, and smashes it as easily as a barley-
sugar temple. This principle of “good faith,” when properly exercised,
is a very noble one, but was it always so rigidly observed by the British
Government P , Isn't there a brazen monument to the contrary opposite
Apsley House? Wasn't the Statue of His Equestrian Highness the
Duke allowed to be hoisted up to its present eminence, upon the “good
faith” that it was to come down again if the height was not found to
diminish its hideousness? It never has come down again; and so what
becomes of the boasted “good faith” of the Government?. They can
break it when a Duke is concerned, but when the education of the entire
people is concerned, they observe it with a nicety of punctiliousness
that would be highly amusing if the result had not been so humiliating.
The Crystal Palace has been pulled down in obedience to “good faith.”
The Wellington Statue should be made to bow, to the same principle,
and be whipped off its present elevation. Will the Government have
the “good faith” to do it?
Wonderful Instinct of a French Eagle.
An eagle—a French eagle—is missing from the trophies of Chelsea
Hospital, said to have been stolen. How mean and unimaginative the
charge! The fact is, the heroic bird on the coming tenth of May was
suddenly animated by the guardian saint of France, and is—at the time
of our writing—expected to perch upon the head of Louis NApoleon
in the Champs-de-Mars. If the thing succeeds as expected, he will be
immediately saluted emperor!
MoTTo For A Stove.—“Register! Register! Register!”
MISS VIOLET AND HER “OFFERS.”
CHAPTER Wii.
I Hope I have done right. But Papa had gone up from Brighton to
town, and I had no one to consult. It came upon me so unexpectedly,
too, and had to be disposed of directly; Right or wrong-but I am
sure I was right—the question is settled, and so is the REveREND
IchAboD BLARE. - -
We used to see a good deal of him when we lived at Hampstead, I
was going to say because he had a chapel somewhere in Camden Town,
but it might be more correct to say, because papa was very hospitable.
Before he retired from business, he used regularly to walk home from
the City; and it was quite astonishing how often the REveREND
MR. BLARE happened to cross his road just in time to catch him.
Sometimes the ReverEND IcHABoD would pop out near Mother Red
Cap's, ramming some tracts into his pocket as soon as he was sure
a had seen them; sometimes he would be descending Haverstock
l, reading a little book, and would nearly run over papa, before pre-
tending to recognise him. Then he would look up with a very sweet
smile, and say with a sort of sigh,
“Ah, my friend | So the toil of the day is over, and the labourer
returns to his rest?... Well—well—well.”. And with, each of the last
three words he would pat papa gently on the arm, as if compassionating
; need of rest, and not judging him too austerely for going home to
inner.
Papa understood it all perfectly well, and when the dinner-bell rang,
and'ſ managed to meet him him and kiss him as he came out of his
dressing-room, he used to tell me, in a low droll voice, the form of
encouragement he had that day received from his reverend friend. But
he was so good-natured that he generally let MR. Ichabod accomplish
his object, and only baffled him
when we had clergymen of a
much nicer kind coming to
dinner. And sometimes, too,
papa would make little mis-
chievous reprisals. One day
the Reventspichaboodarted
out of ambush, in Flask Walk
and pounced upon papa an
me.
“Ah! MR. BLARE, if we had
only met yesterday ! The
Bishop of St. CRoziers, my
old schoolſellow, was in town
about some livings he has to fill
up, and came up to take his
chop with me. You would
have liked to meet him.”
The REVEREND MR. BLARE
knew that very well, and his
fat face looked uglier than ever
as he pretended to smile awa
his annoyance, and answered,
meekly,
“These things are not in our
own disposal, my friend. Yet
I was walking about on the
hill, as it chanced, for upwards of an hour, about your usual time.”
“We came home Regent's Parkway,” Papa replied, “to take up a
. clergyman in Albany Street whom I wanted to introduce to the
ishop.”
“A dangerous neighbourhood,” MR. BLARE said, indemnifying him-
self for his vexation with a little bit of spite. “Dangerously near
Puseyite ground” (for the REveREND IchAboD, is so furiously
Claphamite, that his conscience forbade him to go to the May Meetings,
because Exeter Hall bore the name of DR. PhILPOTT's diocese). “I
trust your friend meddles not with such leaven. There is only one way
in which such persons should be brought under the notice of a bishop.”
“I trust I have not done anything wrong,” papa answered, humbly.
“I think not, because his Lordship seemed pleased with my young
friend, and made an appointment for him to meet the Examining
Chaplain.”
But it was not often that papa would amuse himself in this way, and
generally when MR. Ichabod had patted his arm, and encouraged the
labourer to go to his rest, would say,
“The labourer has got some Šven salmon to-day” (or some
lamperns from Tewkesbury, or some teal, or whatever it might be);
“come on to his hut, if you have nothing better to do.”
And you may take my word for it that the REveREND Ichabod
BLARE never had anything better to do, or if he had, he never did it.
I said he was an ugly young man, but it was not a common kind of
ugliness. His forehead retreated, and his nose, which was a very
ignoble sort of pyramidical nose, projected very far, and so did his lips;

and his great ſat double chin had not the least little atom of whiskers;
and he º wore a white cravat, very tight, so that he always
looked hot; and being stout, and wearing a dress coat, and everything
else of black (except his Berlin gloves), he resembled an undertaker
rejoicing in a good business. But papa has brought home much more
hideous men, who have gone away leaving me perfectly in love with
them. There was a coarseness of expression about the REVEREND
MR. IcHABoD's face, which, I suppose, made it so disagreeable. He
was a pushing, prosperous person, and his flocks used to make a great
deal of him, and present him with silver services, and new gowns, and
portraits of himself; but he deserted them without the least compunc-
tion, the moment anything better offered.
MR. BLARE had been staying at Brighton, and had called several
times, but, until the morning I speak, of, we had been out. I was
near the window, feeding my canary birds, and wondering whether dear
MR. KIDD ever went out as private tutor to teach the darling things the
feats he describes so delightfully, as, if so, Isaid I would make papaengage
him for mine. LARE came to the door, and saw me as he rang, an
he quite walked over the servant, rebuking the poor girl for falsehood in
trying to say “not at home.” I was fairly caught, for I had let my birds
out, and I was afraid to leave them, or I should have run away.
“Ah, Miss WIOLET'" he said, marching into the room, his thick
boots creaking dreadfully. And stalking up to me, he frightened É
poor birds so, that they flew round and round the room, until one fell
down in the dust behind the looking-glass, and the other dashed
out into the hall, and half stunned itself against the window. I was
so angry : -
“Here,” he said, sitting himself down guite composedly (I wished
the light chair had crunched under him), “here, my dear young lady,
you behold an illustration of our depraved nature.”
I looked at him, and felt quite inclined to agree with him. For I
always disliked him, as I am afraid what I have said will have dis-
covered. But while my poor bird was scratching, and fluttering, and
chirping in dismay behind the glass, I almost hated the REVEREND
ICHABod.
“Thus,” he continued, “we all act, like those silly and foolish birds.”
“They are neither silly nor foolish, MR. BLARE,” I said (I fear, quite
rudely), “but they know their friends, and dislike strangers.” And I
tried to coax poor little Jujube from his cranny; and the little thing,
knowing my voice, was endeavouring to extricate himself, when
MR. BLARE, who had been looking at me impatiently, snatched up his
great thick cotton umbrella, and actually thrust it in between the wall
and the glass, to “poke the bird towards me,” as he said., I was so
astonished at anybody thinking of such a thing, that I could hardly cry
out, and MR. BLARE, with a sort of grin, would certainly have killed
poor Jujube, or hurt him dreadfully, when, I am delighted to say, the
force of the great thick umbrella was too much for the fastenings which
held the glass, and down came the fl. itself upon the fender, with a
smash that sent it into a thousand pieces. Poor Jujube flew to his
cage, and, dusty as he was, began to chirrup out his gratitude at being
delivered; while there stood the ReverEND, ICHARod BLARE, with his
umbrella in his hand, and his mouth open. I could not help laughing,
startled as I was, to see his dismay. -
“A bad omen, MR. BLARE,” I said, “to break a looking-glass Ill
luck for seven years to come—at least, so my old nurse taught me.”
But he would not laugh, and gave such a savage look at poor Jujube,
who was cleaning his wings, and chirping in exultation, that I was quite
glad I was there to protect the poor little creature. It was clear that
the horrid man thought he should have to pay the lodging-keeper for the
glass; as if papa would have heard of such a thing.
A Monster Sweep.
Of all the Sweeps that from time immemorial have knocked their
sooty implements together on the First of May, surely no noise ever
equalled that made by the destruction of the Crystal Palace, which com-
menced on that day. Such a set of Sweeps were never e ed on
such dirty work before; and the Parliament which ordered the beau-
tiful building to be swept away, proved itself, by flying so directly in
the face of the country, to be the Greatest Sweep that ever existed.
We hope when the elections come on, that the people will recollect that
the Sweep in question was a “DERBY Sweep.”

How strange that the very same men who, last Session,
Tried to make us put * with the papal aggression,
Have been working as hard, on a recent occasion,
To prevent all precaution 'gainst foreign invasion!
Do they fancy that there’s too much pride in the nation,
And think it requires a slight humiliation?
Are their souls so to mercantile objects restricted,
That they care not what shame on their country’s inflicted ?
'...}} quite make one's faith in them waver—
Are they bidding for certain constituents' favour?
Is their line only one of political scheming,
Are they, wide awake, canting, or honestly dreaming f
Their very extremely forbearing opinions,
In practice, would quickly enslave these dominions;
Their objection to fight—though defensive the battle—
Would degrade us, ere long, into mere servile cattle.
We agree with these gentlemen, freely and fully,
That the doughty JoHN BULL must no more play John Bully;
But if they musi needs make a farther endeavour,
To bring down John BULL to John Ox—we cry, Never!
A MILITIA BILL IN 1952.
oUBTLEss, could we peep another century
into futurity, perhaps, unless the Miſ-
lennium is to arrive before that, we might
witness, in progress through the House
of Commons, a bill for the further Im-
}. of the National Defences.
n consequence of the immense progress
that science will have made by that time,
the debate foreshown to us, would pro-
bably evince, that some curious changes
had taken place in our munitions. One
Honourable Member would be heard
moving for returns of the acids employed
in maintaining the galvanic batteries
along the coast in an efficient state; and
another arguing that the regular steam
army was infinitely preferable to a
Militia, composed of engines taken from
# behind, the counter and the plough's
+ tail. A third, perhaps, would then be
- - found repudiating all recourse to phy-
sical dynamic machines; and declaring his conviction that the strongest
horse-power might be effectually resisted by the silent will, and the
quiet force of opinion.
A Hint to the Prince President.
Conside RING that the French Senators are expressly required to
ºf...". with their eyes shut, and on no account permitted to appear in
what an electro-biologist would term “a wakeful state,” we really
almost wouder that a decree has not been issued, changing the name
of the Chamber of Deputies to that of the “Bed Chamber of Deputies,”
and ordering that in future, each member, upon his entrance, shall be
Presidentially provided with a nightcap.
LOVE IN A BOTTLE.
We see a Tradesman is advertising a new Spirit, called “THE SPIRIt
or Love.” We don't know what kind of Spirit this may be, but we
imagine it must be Parfait Amour.
The Fate of all Umbrellas.
THE Umbrella, seems to be a doomed article. Every man's hand,
apparently, is raised against it. Its fate is uncertain enough in
ngland; but in Germany it seems to be much worse. The Germans
must be the greatest robbers of Umbrellas, in the world; for the
Umbrella-makers themselves, gravely tell us in their advertisements
“THE GERMAN(s) STEEL UMBRELLAs.”

MR. BENDIZZY'S “RAPID ACT WITH A CHANGE.”
DOCTORS IN PETTILOONS.
THERE appeared the other day in the Times, a letter, showing * an attempt to extort
services from a governess, on terms even shabbier than usual. This has called forth another
letter in the same journal, signed A.S., treating such exposures, with disdain, on the ground
# - ºliº, and insisting that the remedy for the evil complained of, is another
thing; tha
"Until a woman's sphere is enlarged, and she is allowed a fair chance of making an honest livelihood for
herself, she must simply be a governess and starve.”
A. S. means to say that the range of employments now open to women ought to be
extended beyond its present limits, which, for educated ladies, are those of the drawing-
room and the nursery. Mr. Punch is not the man who would wish to restrict female industry
to infant tuition, or to chronicling small beer, either with or without the duty annexed
thereto by IAGo. However, A. S. indignantly remarks:—
“There is at this present time a lady practising successfully in New York, as a physician, and it is a fact
that when the intelligence came to Europe that the thing was being attempted, she was attacked by Punch with
ungentlemanly, scurrility; and, on that very serious occasion, was there any kind-hearted man, was there any
father of a family, who, for the love and respect he bore his own daughters, would interfere to plead the cause
of justice and humanity against that popular periodical?”
The pages of Punch would not constitute a
“popular periodical,” if they were stained with
“ungentlemanly scurrility.” Indeed, Mr. Punch
is too much of a gentleman to bandy abuse. He
will not, therefore, call the language of A. S. un-
ladylike. On the contrary, he has much plea-
sure in expressing his belief that A. S. is a lady;
and, from certain Yankeeisms in her letter, toge-
ther with her advocacy of female doctors, he also
infers that she is an American and a Bloomer—
at least a Bloomer in heart, if not in trousers.
But now, as touching that “very serious occa-
sion,” as A. S. sharply enough calls it, on which
Mr. Punch alluded to the New York doctrix.
Mr. Punch begs to .." to A. S. that the
reason that no benevolent man, no father of a
family, came forward, for the love and respect
they bore their own daughters, to deprecate the
observations of Mr. Punch, probably was, that
benevolent men and fathers of families, in
England, for the most part, bear too much love
and too much respect for their daughters to
think of allowing them to walk the hospitals,
and wield the scalpel. A. S., happily, does not
know what she is writing about in claiming, as
within the province of women, a profession
which necessitates the studies of anatomy and
physiology, without the knowledge of which its
practice might be the physician's living, but
would be the reverse to the patient.
There are some employments that are peculiarly
masculine. Medicine is pre-eminently man's
work. An able-bodied female might, with
greater propriety, be a navvy, than a strong-
minded woman could be a physician. Women,
truly, make the best nurses; but the interference
of nurses in the treatment of a case is one of
the greatest obstacles that the physician has to
contend with. Woman is a flower that, let us
hope, will never expose itself to be plucked at
the Hall: a doctor must be made of sterner stuff
than the material of her heart and brain. The
upper story of a lady is even less fitted for the
reception of medical details, than her lower ex-
tremities are to be invested with boots, &c. If
A. S. still desires to wear the latter, Mr. Punch
hopes that he has now so far enlightened her
that she will no longer want to be conversant with
the former.
Mr. Punch begs to repeat that he takes A. S.
for a lady, in whom nescience of the nature of
the medical profession is natural and proper. If
he had thought those initials were a man's, he
should have merely recommended the addition
of another S. to them.
The Pope in Paris.
This is about the season when, in certain
suburbs and bye-lanes and alleys, we are wont to
hear the old, lingering cry of “Young lambs to
sell.” It is said that Pope Pio may shortly be
expected with some such cry in Paris. He is
announced as likely to come to France to anoint
the PREsident ; as if such a slippery fellow
needed any extra greasing. Nevertheless, the
visit will be but an interchange of courtesies
between Pope and PRESIDENT. Louis Naro-
Leon sent powder and ball in aid of the Father;
and the Pope, in return, bestows holy oil an
holy prayer. Yet, after all, bullets no more make
Popes, than grease and hireling benediction
make Emperors.
The Old Want with a New Face.
ColoneLSIBTHoRP has given public notice of
the desolating fact! He “wants confidence in
the present Ministers.” In truth it is now
generally understood in the best informed circles
that the gallant member for old Tom of Lincoln
wants, iá will continue to want, confidence In
everybody, except—(reader, a word in your ear
and that insecresy)—except ColonELSIBTHORP

THE GAME OF GLOBULES.
HE Morning Post
the other day re-
ported a homoeo-
pathic banquet,
whereat,however,
the principle that
homoeopathy does
not always con-
fine its disciples
to infinitesimal
quantities was as-
serted, and—we
suppose—demon-
strated also. This
was the Hahne-
mann Hospital
Dinner,which was
eaten on the 10th
instant, at the
London Tavern.
|
º
Tº ºv ^ After the discus
N -- -
Şsº N sion of the comes-
.— tible good things,
came the feast of
reason; if such a
term can be applied to the swallowing of encomiums of homoeopathy,
to which the more fluent members of the company treated the others.
Some remarkable things were said by some of these gentlemen.
ºlºs, in proposing the health cf the QUEEN, expressed a
wish that
“HER MAJEsty's life, either by the power of homoeopathy or allopathy, might be
preserved for several years to come.”
May the QUEEN live a thousand years! But must the preservation of
our Gracious Sovereign depend either on homoeopathy or allopathy.”
When we drink the QUEEN’s health—which is not seldom—our wish is
that it may continue in a robust sta'e, independently of any medical
treatment whatever; of any doses, whether operative or infinitesimal;
of boluses and globules alike. -
DR. Epps uttered something worth hearing. It was a quotation
from SHAKspEARE. Men, he said, have sought—
. . . . “the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth.”
The globule reputation is what some people seek, or rather, it is all
they find, when, by agitating for the diffusion of nonsense, they acquire
infinitesimal celebrity. Dr. Épps should have thought of that. By-
the-bye, as the Šiši. reputation is to be found occasionally in the
mouth of the cannon, so, we should think, would the globule of
homoeopathic medicine be now and then discovered, by careful exami-
nation, in the mouth of the patient, or somewhere else in that line of
road vulgarly called the red lane, as so minute a thing is likely enough
to be taken without being swallowed; and, like }.}, “Amen,” to
stick in the throat.
A truly valuable observation was made by DR. MADDEN. It was
the following:—
“Of the approximation of old physic to homoeopathy, I may give one instance out
of many, which will be the more interesting as it refers to no less a person than SIR
B. Brodie. I have no doubt that most persons here present are aware that SIR
BENJAMIN is celebrated for his treatment of affections of the joints and spine. Well,
during thirty years of his practice, SIR BENJAMIN recommended bleeding, leeches,
cupping, purging, salivation, blisters, setons, and cauterisms; but in the last edition
º: work in 1850, he tells us that a more enlarged experience has satisfied him that
in the very great majority of instances this painful and loathsome treatment is not
only not useful, but actually injurious; and that he has ceased to torment his
F. and is convinced that the change has been attended with the happiest
res -
Now, suppose SIR BENJAMIN BRODIE had, besides mitigating his old
treatment, given his patients infinitesimal globules of medicine, would
not the superlatively happy results of his improved practice have been
ascribed by homoeopathists to the globules, no less, if not rather, than
to the discontinuance of the bleeding, and so on ?
Ladies and gentlemen, who form opinions about medicine without
understanding the subject, should be informed that disease is in general
a process naturally terminating in recovery; that many diseases will
get well without the aid of medicine; and that next to giving no medi-
cine at all in such cases, the best plan is to give next to no medicine—
that is to say, infinitesimal globules. But then these wise gentlemen
and judicious ladies should consider that the infinitesimal globules do
not any good, but simply do infinitely small harm.
ides “homoeopathy” and “allopathy,” there is a species of
practice which may be called oudenopathy, thus epitomised by Macbeth
aforesaid:—
“Throw physic to the dogs—I'll none of it.”
This is the best system of medicine for many patients who are
really ill, and for all those who have nothing, the matter with them.
Homoeopathy is a near approach to it, and no doubt permits a sufficient
number to get well to make persons of quality, but not of discernment,
believe it cures them.
SIR. John KENNAway adverted—in very polite terms—to Mr.
Punch's dealings with homoeopathy. Homoeopathy may, as SIR John
says, have stood the test of ridicule; so has astrology: there are
º: who take in ZADKIEL's Almanac, which returns the obligation.
}. ike manner there are those who subscribe to homoeopathic institu-
tions: but we hope SIR John KENNAWAY will find a better use for
his money.
THE GREAT ANTI-WAGNER DEMONSTRATION.
A LARGE body of the distinguished professional foreigners exercising
their various abilities in London, met yesterday somewhere in Exeter
Hall to protest against the assumed axiom of HERR ALBERT WAGNER,
that “England was only to be valued for her money.” . The meeting
was very full; and the manner of the meeting very animated, not to
say at times a little impetuous. M. JULLIEN (in a waistcoat expressly
made, and got up regardless of expense, for the occasion) was called to
the chair, and briefly explained the objects of the meeting; gracefully
and emphatically marking with his baton the points, as he impartially
considered, most worthy of attention.
A want of º we always want, where we do not want to
be diffuse)—compels us to condense, or crush, the sentiments of the
speakers, into a few general opinions,
SIGNOR Fold EROLDI (the distinguished tenor,) had no idea of mone
on his visit—(a visit that had stretched over ten seasons)—to England.
He certainly took a salary, for the mere prejudice of the thing: but his
principal object in visiting England was to study the style, and warmth,
and colouring of British vocalists.
MADAME Sottovoce (the illustrious prima donna,) declared upon her
honour, and as true as she was a lady, that although she had purchased
two or three palazzi—one on the Arno, one at Como, and one no matter
where—with the money she had received from both the Operas—not-
withstanding, and nevertheless, and she wished she might die that
minute if it wasn’t true-English money was always the last thing in
her thoughts. No : if she must say what brought her first to England,
it was to study the English toilette. As for money—she hoped nobody
would name it; and did really wonder what that WAGNER meant.
HERR STURMwFTTER (the great chiropodist,) said, certainly, to
employ his leisure, he did cut corns. . It so happened that he had testi-
monials to his skill from the Duke in his palace, to the President of
France when in his second floor back. But he never cared for money:
no; his object in coming to England was to give his mind to Magna
Charta. Fees were all very well; but his E." was habeas corpus.
M. SoYER had had English money forced upon him. He had
been covered with English money, like a gingerbread chanticleer (a
Gallic, cock) at Bartlemy Fair; but money he despised—especially
British, money; No; he had, only one aim in visiting and living
in England: that was, to study, and thoroughly to master, in all its
ramifications and developments (he knew those were the words, though
they were very hard ones), the truly 13ritish dish of “toad-in-a-hole.”
England had flung frogs in the face of France; but that was no reason
he should despise the truly British toads in their truly British holes.
As for money—he wouldn't trust himself to say what he thought of it.
Doctor BEccAFico (the great homoeopathist,) practised medicine
upon the principles of the immortal HAHNEMANN; but that really had
nothing to do with his election of England as his place of residence.
He certainly could not—and he would be bold to say, he would not.—
refuse fees when offered him; but he considered the extraordinary
assertion of Hean Wagnºn called for explicit denial and condemnation
on the part of every foreigner protected by the flag of Britain. He
(Doctor B.) would at once state that the sole cause that lured him to
England, and had kept him here, was not English money, but English
skies; not English gold, but the bright, unclouded, English blue.
There was then made a proposal of a very strong remonstrance—so
strong it might almost pass for a condemnation of the illiberal and
ignorant and selfish assertion of HERR WAGNER touching England and
her money. At length, a very pithy avowal was adopted, embodying
the feelings of the professional foreigners in England. It was simply
this, engrossed:
“MONEY NO OBJECT.”
(Here follow signatures.)
When we left, there was a skrimmage between an organ-boy and a
Lascar, as to who should first affix his x.
A Remedy for Chancery.
“MR. PUNCH,-(writes HERR DUMMKoPF)—What is the remedy for

CHAPTER VIII.
The crash of the looking-glass of course brought the servants into
the room; and, by the time the pieces were swept up, an had put
Jujube and the other bird into the cage, and the scene was over, the
REVEREND Mr. BLARE had recovered his usual sleek tranquility. He
was good enough to tell me not to be discomposed about these little
worldly trials, which, however vexatious they might appear, were
nothing to what missionaries and their converts in the interior of
Africa were undergoing every day. And to bring my mind into a
roper state for what was to follow, he pulled out a Report of the
§. Rise Auxiliary Junction Branch of the British and Abyssinian
and read a most affecting letter from
bne BRoth ER CLAMMY, an Abyssinian correspondent, who stated that
he had recently been privileged to yoke himself together in marriage
with SistER WAshti GUBBINs, also an agent of the Society. But the
sister had found favour in the eyes of KING Quoppo BUNgo, the chief
of a tribe to whom she and the brother had paid a visit; and his
Majesty had not only been graciously pleased to insist on being present
at the wedding, but, in the exuberance of his good-humour, had ordered
one of the bridesmaids (a native convert) to be cooked for his supper
and that of the happy pair. -
Replacing the Clapham Rise Report in his pocket, MR. BLARE looked
Anti-Pelagian School sº
y
="An old, common-place argument, unworthy of you, my dear
*. BROMPTON. It has been urged and answered thousands of
imes.”
“i-I assure you,” I said (ashamed that I should have been so
ignorant), “that I did not think of an argument. I only said what
came into my mind.”
“Utterly unworthy,” he continued, as if the words were the regular
form (and I suspect they are) in which to meet the objection. “Look
into the Times, and you will see that subscriptions of hundreds of thou-
sands of pounds, for doing good in the Antipodes, attest how little value
seriously minded people attach to your conditions.”
“I am sure,” I replied, “that I ought not to contest such a matter,
or any other matter, indeed; for I am sadly ignorant. But papa
was lately reading to me, from the same Times, that, in London only,
one person out of every twenty who rise in the morning, has no means
of food or shelter for the day and coming night, except what may be
afforded by accident or crime. And I think he said, that as there
were about two millions of people in London, this would make about
one hundred thousand driven every day to beg, or to do wrong, in order
to keep life in them, poor creatures. Perhaps—but, mind, I am not
º. of these thousands of pounds that go to the Antipodes
might do more good if they were spent in helping our own unfortunate
neighbours.”
I quite coloured at having made so long a speech to a clergyman.
‘....So much for poor human instinct, poor human reason,” he said,
smiling. “Let us who know better be thankful.”
I saw no objection to this arrangement, and, as just then EMMA came
in to say that lunch was ready, I thought I would imitate papa, in a
small way.
“Do you like sardines, MR. BLARE * I asked....“Papa has brought
ºne which he declares are gold fish. Will you come and try
them P'
The REVEREND MR. BLARE immediately offered me his arm, for
which I saw no particular occasion, and we went into the other room,
where, though he modestly declared he was very partial to the
sardines, he showed becoming impartiality by also feasting very heartily
upon everything else, not forgetting papa's pale sluerry, of which he
nearly finished a bottle. I too up some crochet, not to seem to hurry
him, but every time I looked up, I observed that MR. BLARE was
staring at me in an extraordinary manner. -
“You are knitting,” he suddenly said, after a long silence.
I was doing nothing of the kind, but men are dreadfully stupid about
such matters, and confound all our work most absurdly. And yet they
think us such frivolous ill-informed things, if we ask whether prisoners
are ever tried in the Court of Chancery, or whether handicaps are some
kind of jockey's costume, or why a second reading of a bill in Parlia-
ment should be made more fuss about than a first.
“Not exactly knitting,” I said, “but—”
“Yes, you are,” he said, quite peremptorily;
which, perhaps, you reck not of, but which is good
nevertheless.” -
I thought that he had been taking in the Family Herald; and was
going to retail to me one of the capital American stories papa is so fond
#d! I looked up, prepared to laugh as soon as he should explain the
riddle.
“A knitting of hearts,” he said, solemnly, “to be unravelled only
when this valley shall have been traversed.” -
I do not know how I looked then, or indeed during the rest of the
interview; but the REveREND IchaboD probably did, for he got u
rather hastily, came round to me, drew a chair very near me, an
sitting down, rested himself slopingly on the table, so as to command
a good view of my face. -
“Miss BROMPton,” he said, “I came here this day for a purpose
which (Providence willing) I will now carry out. What I have to say
may surprise you, but I have observed that you have received the gift
of humility and self-abasement, and I do not fear that you will be
puffed up. First, I would tell you of a providential occurrence which
has happened to myself. I have been guided to purchase a chapel at
the west end of the town, and I have bought it cheaply, for the seller
was in straitened circumstances, and clutched at my ready money,
a knitting
abiding work,
at me with a most elaborate smile of exceeding duration, and then,
in an oily voice, asked me whether I thought I should have courage
to become, like the dear sister of whom he had read to me, a labourer
in the vineyard of duty. I had managed to recover my amiability
(which, indeed, I felt ashamed of myself for having lost, for MR. BLARE
had frightened my birds by mere accident, and could not have meant to
annoy me), and so I answered, laughingly, that I was afraid I should
make a poor labourer in any cause, but I thought that what duty I
ought to do must lie a little nearer than Abyssinia. But I supposed
SistER GUBBINs had been a lady without any relations or friends to
whom she could be of service, and that the neighbourhood in which she
had lived, when at home, had stood in no need of assistance. If that
were so, icould admire the philanthropy which had led her to a distant
part of the world. -
The REvºzend IchaboD BLARE shook his head, and said pityingly
though I offered him far less than his worldly cunning induced him to
ask. . With a small outlay, and due exertions on my part, I trust to
find in this speculation not only a good investment, but the means of
an ample income. There is no place near, my purchase where the
inhabitants of the locality can hear what I shall be privileged to tell
them. The parish church is well attended, but the incumbent is old,
and I doubt not to thin his ranks. All promises well. But this is not
enough,for me—l know not whether you divine what I would go on
to say.
He actually tried to take my hand; but I put it into my crochet-
box to be out of his way.
“You wish papa to fake sittings, I suppose? I must refer you to
him; he has views of his own on these subjects, as you know.”
“You must, indeed, refer me to him ", cries MR. BLARE, in a sort of
hallowed enthusiasm: “but not about a holding, to be renewed quarterly

receipts to be had in the vestry. In a word, Miss BROMPTON, I will
not talk to you of worldly admiration—for we ought all to hate and
despise our worthless selves, and everybody else (who is equally worth-
less, at least); but I will at once say to you, ‘Let us do even as SISTER
WASHTI and BROTHER CLAMMY.”
“My goodness!” I said, very much frightened, and yet quite unable
to forbear laughing at the sudden proposal, and the way it was con-
veyed: “I declare. I do not know one young lady whom I could ask
to be bridesmaid, if she was to be eaten afterwards.”
But MR. BLARE would not laugh. He was dreadfully in earnest.
“Nay! ” he said; “let us not sport with serious things. It may be
that you feel yourself unworthy, from previous habits, of the important
position I offer you. That is not a bad sign; but we would bope that
under my sedulous care our tender flower” (he meant me) “might
grow up into a cedar of Lebanon.”
I was too startled to object to his horticultural theory; but I hastily
glanced at the bell-handle.
“Do not think the match unsuitable for me,” he said, kindly, to
remove the only difficulty I could feel. “Your worthy father is rich
and influential, and you have neither brother nor sister. I do not, in
truth, feel that this objection need weigh upon your tender conscience.
And so, my dear lamb,” he said, (hastening from botany to zoology),
*few words need pass between those who understand one another.

all becoming—”
Up to this moment the REVEREND ICHABoD had really advanced so
rapidly, that there was no time for me to speak. . But matters were
now growing serious, and the crisis demanded resolution.
“MR. BLARE,” I said, getting some little distance from him, “pray
let me speak!." For he was pulling his chair after me. “I—I—ſ am
very much obliged to you indeed, for your good opinion of me; but—
but nothing could ever induce me to-to-to-be a WASHTI CLAMMY.”
At least, I believe I said something of this kind; and the next
moment I darted out of the room.
I am certain he did not misunderstand me; for he remained some
little time in the parlour, very sensibly drinking all the wine that was
left. I say very sensibi , for the last glass of wine the REveREND
IchABop BLARE ever had under papa's roof, was that with which he
º himself for the unfavourable result of Miss WIOLET’s First

DENSITY IN HIGH LIFE,
VERY one of our contemporaries gave
an account of a “reception ”
held, the other evening, by the
Countess of DERBY, at her hus-
band's “official residence” in
Downing Street. LoRD DERBy
had also given a “full dress
banquet” at his office, and as the
former party followed on the
katter, it was, says the Post, “by
far the most brilliant réunion of
the present season. The rooms
over the office, or “saloons,” as
they are called in that newspaper,
were crammed, so that “there
ensued at last a complete block.”
_ Fancy so many of the heads of
society forming one block—as it
further appears they did: since we are told that
“The DUKE or WELLINgrow himself, with the MARCHIoness of SAlisbury on his
arm, could make no impression on the dense mass of nobility and aignity that hemmed
him and each other in on all sides.”
No wonder that this “mass of nobility and dignity” was so dense
that the DUKE of WELLINGTON himself could make no impression on
it, seeing that a party at the EARL of DERBY’s place of business was
probably a Protectionist party.
France-A Free Country!

Chief, in Paris, refused to attend the bidding of his master, saying that
“he was now in a free country l’” This compliment coming to the

believer in the freedom of France with the Legion of Honour. It is
said that the PRESIDENT was quite overcome by the delicate flattery 1

the conclusion, that one of them is an abbreviation of the word Rump-
steak. In short, the puzzle on the solution of which we have been
ergaged with so much industry and so little success, is part of a
butcher's bill. The bills of butchers are really almost as difficult to
understand as acts of Parliament. Now, it may be desirable that a
physician's prescription should sometimes be written in ciphers and
contractions unintelligible to the patient; but there can be no reason
for concealing from us what we have been having for dinner. It
is therefore suggested that butchers might, as well, henceforth, write
their bills legibly, and not continue to add to the cares and miseries
of the father of a family, by giving him unnecessary perplexity and
trouble in auditing his weekly accounts.
Louis Napoleon's Last Act.
THE coup d'état of the 2d of December was a heavy blow; and when
we consider the uniforms, embroideries, upholsteries, priests, troops,
slaves (who were very numerous), and attendants, exhibited by Louis
NAPOLEoN the other day at his distribution of Eagles, and compare
these properties and supernumeraries with what we witness on the
stage, we are inclined to call the fête of the Champ de Mars—the
last new grand fête of that ilk—“a tremendous hit.”
THE BITTERS OF OFFICE.
WE hear a great deal about the sweets of office, but few of us think
of its annoyances. The Court Circular, a few days ago, furnished an
instance of the truth, that power has its dismal as well as its brilliant
side, for we are informed that, on Friday last, “Colon ELSIBTHORP had
an interview with MR. SecretaRY WALPole.”
Nicholas, As. A HUNGARIAN.—The EMPEROR Nicholas entered
Vienna, we are told, “wearing the uniform of a Hungarian general.”
The uniform of Hungary! Thus may the clothes of the victim be at
times found upon the back of the accomplice in his destruction.

POLITICAL ELECTRO-BIOLOGY.
SEING the wonders that are alleged to be performed by Electro-
I Biology, which purports to keep the subject under the entire domi-
nion of the practitioner's will, we are surprised that it has not been already
taken in hand by the professors of politics., Qne of the effects of the
art is to make a person under its influence believe when he is drinking
water that he is imbibing whatever else the professor may think fit to
turn it into. Such a power would be most valuable in dealing with John
BULL, who might thus be made to swallow whatever the Minister should
desire to force down the throat of the victim. The great advantage of
Electro-Biology over common-place Mesmerism consists in the fact, that
the operations of the former are successful when the patient is in ...a
perfectly wakeful state;” and, as John BULL cannot be very readily
induced to shut his eyes in these days, mere Mesmerism would be of
comparatively little use in ſº the better of his senses. Electro-
Biology, on the other hand, causes the patient to do, and to suffer,
all sorts of things against his own will, and with his eyes wide
OOcn.
"Those who have attended at an Electro-Biological exhibition will have
observed that one of its features consists in making an individual hold
something in his hand, and telling him after he has kept his eyes fixed
upon it for some time, that he cannot, if he were to try ever so hard,
get rid of it...Our old friend JoHN BULL is, just now, in this very
awkward position with regard to the Income Tax, which he has looked
at very seriously and intently for some time, with a strong desire to get it
off his hands; but he is now told by our financial professor of Electro-
Biology that the objectionable weight is “not to be got rid of.”
The victim seems really to be under an Electro-Biological influence
of some sort, for he has been actually brought to believe, to a certain
extent, that, in spite of his own will, he is under some mysterious
obligation to bear the present, burden. Whether the Professor will
succeed in working on the imagination of the patient, so far as to make
him, believe that it is a lump of sugar he has before him, may be
doubtful; but the fact cannot be disputed, that John BULL has the
hateful weight of the Income Tax upon his hands, and that he cannot
at present lay it down, throw it off, wash his hands of it, or in any other
way get rid of it. We can only hope that the Professor, who holds
him in such an unpleasant fix, will set to work as soon as possible to
release him from his unenviable position.
ELECTRO-BIOLOGY..—AN AMUSING EXPERIMENT UPON MR. BULL IN A PERFECTLY WAKEFUL STATE.

THAT’s A LUMP of SUGAR–You CAN'T Move IT, SIR; I DEFY You To GET RID or IT.”
The Author of “Cato" and the Literary Fund.
ADDIson—an unexpected, and no less distinguished guest from
tne shades—attended the literary Fund dinner. The toast, “Lieu-
TENANT-Colonel, Apdison, and the Dramatists” was drunk with
great enthusiasm: The Author of Cato—who it appears has entered

his distinguished friend ShakspeaRE—for he was permitted to call
him his friend—of the compliment conveyed, and would further com.
municate with...BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.. The poet—who did not
appear in his Elysian regimentals—departed before cock-crow.

“The last Slave sold in England.”
OUR friend of Notes and Queries gives the following as an advertisement
of the last slave sold in England, from the Public Ledger, Dec. 31, 1761:-
Foº SALE.—A Healthy Negro Girl, aged about 15 Years; speaks good
English, works at her needle, washes well, does household work, and has had the
small-pox.
This is all very well, but quite a mistake as to the last slave offered
for sale in England. The last slaves offered for sale, and bought, were
at St. Alban's, or at Sudbury, and, if our memory do not fail us, some-
where about the time of the last election... It is expected that a few
more will be put up at the ensuing dissolution.
A REGULAR SETTING Down.—We all know the awkward accident
that sometimes happens between two stools, and we are, therefore,
not surprised that the Ministry, between four seats, should have
nearly fallen to the ground.

WHAT I SAW, DID, THOUGHT, AND HEARD, DURING
MY TRIP TO PARIS LAST WEEK.
(From our own Special Penny-a-Liner.)
HERE were collected on
the Champ de Mars some
80,000 soldiers, and very
beautiful soldiers they were;
and I thought that i
shouldn't exactly like to be
in England, supposing they
succeeded in landing, and
MR. Cobden happened to
be Prime Minister at the
time.
I heard that Louis NA-
Poleon was to have been
proclaimed Emperor, and
that was all I did hear; for
beyond a few weak cries
of “Pipe l’Empereur/* and
those from the soldiers, I
never heard less enthusiasm
evinced by a multitude,-
which was about the largest,
I think, I have ever seen.
I thought that Louis
NApoleon was looking very
- haggard and very unhappy;
but this might have been owing to the dust, or the heat, or probably
the disappointment of the day. -
I saw thousands and thousands of curious specimens of my own
countrymen (where they all came from I cannot imagine); and if a
uliar-looking person went by with an eccentric cap, or dog, or stick,
heard many a Frenchman say, “Look at that original! I'll wager
he’s an Englishman!” and in nineteen cases out of twenty the French-
man would have won his wager,
I saw several British officers in full costume, and I thought that,
handsome as their uniforms looked, they would have done much
better to have kept them in their trunks at home. -
I saw a body of something like a thousand priests leave the beautiful
altar which was erected on the battle-field; and I thought that I had
never seen so many ugly men walk in a procession before, I am sure
there must be a law in France which drives all ugly children, into the
Church. For myself, I think the priests had no business at the fête at
all; and from innumerable opinions. I heard from the blouses and the
bourgeois, I am inclined to think that the people were of myopinion also.
I saw a brace of Englishmen create, unconsciously, a deal of amuse:
ment by carrying about with them, on their shoulders, a couple of
chairs, which they had bought for 2 francs 10 sous each, on one of
the adjoining quais. They followed the army round the Champ de
Mars as well as they could, and, as often as a portion of it stopped,
º: stopped also, and, planting their chairs on the ground, viewed the
evolutions from the top of them. The crowd, as thick as any at Green-
wich Fair, bore the nuisance with the greatest good-humour, and made
way for them as readily as if they had been a couple of chimney-sweeps,
simply exclaiming, “How eccentric, these English are!” They were
never disturbed in their lofty positions: and, on one occasion, when
the younger of the British chairmen abandoned his seat to a lady, the
}} %º was rewarded by a loud cheer, and cries of “Bravo
nglais / "
I afterwards heard that these chairs were carried back in triumph to
the Hôtel Meurice, and exhibited as great trophies for the next two
days. The two Englishmen, dazzled by the success of their first
experiment, tried to repeat it on the evening of the fireworks. This
experiment, however, f regret to say, most ignominiously failed. The
chairs in their progress kept knocking off innumerable hats in the dark,
and poking persons in the ribs; and, though this is a popular form,
believe, of enforcing a joke, still the good-natured Parisians did not
seem to enjoy the present one much, especially when the great point of
it lay in the sharp end of the leg of a chair. Öne chair" was wrested
from its owner, and thrown over the parapet into the Seine; and the other
one, upon being pulled contrary ways, fell all to pieces like the joints
of an over-boiled fowl.
Talking of the fireworks, they were about the dampest, I think, I
have ever seen. Probably, the few drops, of rain that fell over-night
may have had something to do with this, but after all the puffing, and
all the blaze in the papers that had been made about them, never did
fireworks go off under a wet blanket upon so large a scale before. I
am sure I have seen a better display at the Surrey Zoological for a
shilling. The mob wouldn't believe they were over, and waited on the
spot patiently for more than an hour afterwards, wondering when the
fireworks were really going to begin. There was, what was called, a
bouquet and it was pretty enough as long as it lasted; but then it was
so miserably small, that I am sure SouTHBy would put such a bouquet
as that in his button-hole, on a Gala night !
The bouquets on the evening of the Ball were much better managed,
being quite as brilliant as the fireworks, and almost larger. Every lady,
upon entering, was presented with one. The same honour had been
º shown to the cannons,—for, as a matter of course, no French
all can go off well without a Cannon. The mouths of them
had been stopped by a bunch of flowers, and it is to be regretted that
French cannons cannot always be stopped in the same way. The
enthusiasm of this ball, about two o'clock, began to wax very
warm, thanks mainly to the 24,000 candles which were suspended about
the rooms, and were guttering so prodigally, that all the ladies whose
head-dresses consisted of real or artificial flowers, had them suddenly
transformed into wax. The floor was also changed into a Glaciarium,
and, if skates had only been ready at hand—or rather, ready for the
other extremity—the Quadrille des Pálineurs might have been executed
on a footing fully equal to that of the Royal Italian Opera.
Tickets for this Grand Ball were easily procurable. I was told of an
instance in which a handful of them had been thrown into an omnibus
that was coming from a railway station, in the same way that Moses
flings his handbills into the cabs at London Bridge; and a gentleman
assured me that he had been offered a ticket in the Rue de la Paix
“for an old coat, or any cast-off boots.” This may account for the ball
being, as we penny-a-liners, usually delight in saying, “more numerous
than select.” All I know is, that great amusement was created by a
celebrated Duchess leaving the supper-room in the greatest indignation,
upon discovering that the person seated next to her was her lingere, and
that she was dressed out in one of her own dresses.
As for order, everything rolled on as smoothly, as quietly, as a
billiard-ball; as for the weather, if it had been ordered for the occasion
it could not have been finer; as for Paris, it never was gayer, or looked
more beautiful; and as for Louis NAPoleon, Ithink that, beyond one
or two casernes, not a person cares anything for him. I am sure the
Grand Phoque Américain, which I saw in the Champs Elysées, and
which is described as being able “to answer any call that is made to
him, and to listen when spoken to, and to beg, and waltz, and to have
the intelligence almost of a human being,” created much more en-
thusiasm amongst the people at one of his two-sous performances, than
Louis NApoleon did with all his soldiers, eagles, balls, and fireworks,
during the whole four days. The fact is that, as far as I could see,
the people care nothing at all about him—but tolerate him as a
necessary evil, much in the same way as we do our Income Tax,
knowing the injustice of such a system cannot last for long.
As for the prices of everything, I was glad enough to sleep the first
night in a cab, taking it by the hour; so that, as I overslept myself,
my first night's lodging cost me nineteen francs; and I was told this
was remarkably cheap, as compared with the hotels everyone of which
was full from the garrets down to the cellars. This small item, will
prepare you for the not very astonishing fact of my being here without
two sous in my pocket to jingle together, and that, accordingly, Ishall
feel extremely obliged by your remitting me the payment of this article,
so that I may no longer remain in so unprofessional a predicament.
THE LAST NEW FRENCH QUADRILLE.
(Words for the Tune danced to before Louis NAPoleon last Wednesday,
in the Grand Court of Honour of the Military College.)
CoME, come, we’ve swept up the dead;
The floor is clean, good people: and France—
Now that we can pleasant y tread–
Expects that we shall instantly dance.
As for friends sent to Cayenne,
Them leave grief or fever to kill;

But, quick! join the merry quadrille.

TEMPUS EDAX RERUM.
* Good GRacious ! Is it Possible —No || Yes! No −Yes! Yes |
By Jupiter, it’s A GREY HAiR in My Favourite Whisken tº
“OUR CRITIC * AMONG THE PICTURES.
THAT saddening period of the year has again arrived, when the Con-
certs, and the May Meetings, and the British Artists, and the National
Institute, and the Old Water Colours, and the New Water Colours,
and the Royal Academy, all open their doors to the Public.
The Spring may be as slow of coming as she will; the lilacs ma
obstinately refuse to flower; the wretched peach-buds may expand,
only to be nipped and perished to death; the East wind may persist in
drying up our blood, and souring our tempers; but one Spring
blossoming we are certain of-that painted growth which yearly comes
out on canvas, and is trained, espalier fashion, against the walls of
the Picture Exhibitions in this merry month of May.
The worst of this crop is, that one always knows beforehand what it
will be. Year after year, the old stocks bear the familiar fruits. Now
and then, it is true, a new slip may be planted, or a fresh idea grafted
on to an old trunk. But what is one among so many?
Walk into the Old Water Colours, and what does one see there but
the old hardy annuals?-Hunt's bird's-nests, and rose-buds, and plums,
and primroses, and chubby country boys, and apple-cheeked rustic
maidens; David Cox's glooming Welsh hills, and breezy hay-fields,
and solemn reaches of purple heath; GeoRGE FRIPP's rippling river.
reaches, with eel-pots and locks, gray willows and wind-bowed poplars,
or Dorsetshire sea-side rocks, and green Yorkshire wolds; Copley
FIELDING's lake prettinesses and steaming Sussex Downs; Topham's
slatternly but sweet Irish lasses; CATTERMole's masteries of effect;
FREDERick TAYLER's horses and dogs, French horns, and laced coats;
OAKLEY’s º: and Italian organ-grinders; CALLow's sea-beaches
and stranded hulls; Richardson's North Country moorlands, or
sun-lighted Italian lakes; BRAN white's frozen meres and broads;
JENKINs's Boulogne Shrimpers; ALFRED FRIPP's coppery beauties o
the Claddagh, or the Campagna; Dodgson's avenues and water-gates;
CARL HAAg's sun-steeped Contadine and purple horizons; Duncan's
boats and seas; TuRNER's water-lilied pools; MRs. BARTHolomew’s
dewy flowers; MRs. Sharpe's round-faced inanities; and MR. Evans's
Highland deer-stalkings—how one knows them all! How ingenuously
they reappear, year after year—the same subjects, the same names, the
same places, the same prices, the same pretty faces at the private view,
the same criticisms in the morning papers, i. same little blue tickets
in the same frames!
And as it is with the Old Water Colours, so it is with the New.
There are the usual WARREN's Egyptians, and HAGHe’s wondrous
Netherlandish interiors, and BENNET's oaks and ferns, and Davidson's
hedgerow elms and Surrey commons, and CoR Bould's clean-washed,
cross-hatched, ice-creamed ladies, and WAchER's azure Sicilian
panoramas, and WEIGALL’s cocks and hens, and Wºmen’s Germanized
academics, and Miss Egerton's thoughtful faces, and LEE's Portel
b
means so abundant a crop as usual; and there is not a single Gil %
Matelottes, and FAHEY's Irish blottings—all old friends; not a new
man, nor a new subject, nor a new rendering of an old one.
As it is with water, so it is with oil. What is the use of catalogues?
I know all f. hands, gentlemen, from ZEITTER’s slap-dash in Suffolk-
street to MacLisp's gigantic missal-painting in the Academy. Why
should I pay a shilling extra for superfluous information?
There is one comfort, however, this year. I have not detected a
single Discovery of the Body of Harold ; Picars of Wakefield are i.
in the held! I regret, however, to see that the walls are beginning to
be overrun with cuttings from that prolific nursery-ground, Pepys's
Diary; and Goldsmith's Life promises to become as dangerously
fruitful a stock as his perennial Picar has been hitherto.
There is another comfort for me. I have this year experienced a new
sensation at the Exhibition of the Royal Academy. And I hasten to
record my sense of the obligation to MR. Millais. I offer my hand to
that Pre-Raphaelite brother. I bow down to him, and kiss the edge
of his palette. I have rapped him over the knuckles, in former years,
with my pen. He is at liberty to return the compliment, this year,
with his maul-stick.
Before two pictures of MR. MILLAIs I have spent the happiest hour
that I have ever spent in the Royal Academy Exhibition. In those
two pictures I find more loving observation of Nature, more mastery
in the reproduction of her forms and colours, more insight into the
sentiment of our greatest poet, a deeper feeling of human emotion, a
happier choice of a point of interest, and a more truthful rendering of
its appropriate expression, than in all the rest of those eight hundred
squares of canvas put together.
I owe the painter this acknowledgment of a t and enduring
pleasure, and I rejoice to make it—not for myself only, but for the
thousands who have felt as I felt before these pictures. I may be
heretical. I cannot help it. R.A.s and A.R.A.s, I admire you—I
respect you-I appreciate your skill; and I would gladly purchase your
works, if I could afford it. But for this year give me MR. MILLAIs. He
has painted Ophelia, singing, as she floats to her death, with wide
open unconscious eyes, gazing up to heaven. The woven flowers have
escaped from her relaxing fingers, and are borne idly with the long
mosses of the stream, past the lush July vegetation of the river bank.
The red-breast pipes on the willow spray, the wild roses give their
sweetness to the summer air, the long purples peer from the crowding
leaves, the forget-me-nots lift their blue eyes from the margin as she
floats by, her brown hair drinking in the weight of water, and slowly
dragging down the innocent face, with its insane eyes, till the water
shall choke those sweet lips, now parted for her own death-dirge.
Talk as you like, M'GILP, eminent painter, to your friend MR
Squench, eminent critic, about the needless elaboration of thosewater-
mosses, and the over making-out of the rose-leaves, and the abomi-
nable finish of those river-side weeds matted with gossamer, which the
field botanist may identify leaf by leaf. I tell you, I am aware of none
of these. I see only that face of poor drowning. OPHELLA. My eye
goes to that, and rests on that, and sees nothing else, till—buffoon as I
am, mocker, joker, scurril-knave, street jester, by trade and nature—
the tears blind me, and I am fain to turn from the face of the mad girl
to the natural loveliness that makes her dying beautiful.
If a painter were ever pardonable for painting after a poet—and such
a poet-MR. MILLIAs may be forgiven for this picture of Ophelia.
There is another work by the same hand—“A Huguenot, on St.
Bartholomew's § refusing to shield himself from danger, by wearing
the Roman Catholic badge.”
The Roman Catholic lady and her Huguenot lover are standing under
a garden wall. She has stolen out to meet him, and warn him of the
danger. It has not been without doubt and hesitation that she has
nerved herself to do so. The petals of the flower she has plucked to
pieces in her tremor, are lying at his feet. Her passionate, earnest
face, is turned up to his with the gaze of one that pleads for life,
while her eager º try to fasten the white scarf round his
arm. He will not have it, and with a gentle force impedes her
tremulous effort. What do you read in his face? Love and pride, and
fearlessness, and a shade, perhaps, of incredulity. Some may find one
of these sentiments, some another, some all of them together, some
none of them. This is the rare quality of the picture. It has many
meanings—admits of various interpretations—may be read in divers
ways. The moment is º chosen, when nothing is decided—when
two fates hang trembling in the balance, and the spectator finds himself
assisting in a struggle, of which he may prophesy the issue, as his
sympathy with the love of woman or the strength of man happens to be
strongest.
Of this picture, also, I boldly say, as Isaid of the other, there is not
a whit too much of nicety, or precision, or finish in the details and
accessories. Here, again, what I first see, in spite of myself, is the
subtle human emotion of those two faces. All the rest I may find out
when I have satisfied myself with that. But it is not without an effort
that I can turn from those faces to the flowers that grow at the lovers'
feet, or the creeper that mats the wall above their heads.
There is all that accuracy of eye and power of hand can do in these

pictures, but there is still more of thought and brains. The man who painted these
ictures thought them out. He had a meaning to express, and he has expressed it.
e felt his subject, and he makes me feel it. He cannot go on reproducing these
pictures year after year, for the simple reason that the emotion and sentiment in
each belongs to the §". subject, and to no other. He may paint as elaborate
river banks, as true brick wall, as brilliant lush, and as real a silk dress, but the
º: are not stereotype, and once conceived and painted, are conceived and painted
or ever.
To all R.A.s and A.R.A.s, whether their subjects be rustic or heroic, fanciful or
historical, of the past or of the present, I say, go and do likewise. Unless you can
ve me a pleasure of the same kind as these pictures give me, you do nothing.
efore them I commune with the painter's thoughts; before your works I criticise
coloured canvas.
I say it in no disparagement of§§ The same thing is true of your elders and
your betters; of many Italians and Flemings, whose pictures now fetch their weight
in sovereigns, and are hung in high places.
. In you and in them I recognise the triumph of skill, and the perfection of imita-
tion. But here I see skill and imitative power subservient to thought, and embody-
ing it with a power equal to the best of you.
I have now the honour, Gentlemen, to bid you good-bye till next week.
TAKING THE SHINE OUT OF EVERYTHING.
VV F read that a Frenchman
has lately introduced into
this country an article
called a Diurnal Reflector,
which is intended to in-
vest dark places with the
light of day. We do not
wonder that the inventor
has brought his Diurnal
Reflector to England, in-
stead of trying to intro-
duce it in Paris; for, in
the latter city no Diurnal
Reflections are allowed.
Several newspapers have
already been suppressed
in France for acting as
Diurnal Reflectors, and
there could, of course,
be no hope for any one
desirous of throwing light upon that which is dark at the French seat of Govern-
ment. We have no doubt of the value of the invention, and as the price is
. we recommend the article to every one who wishes for an aid to daily
reflection. -
These reflectors are recommended chiefly for those places in which bad construction
impedes the light; but we presume they will be of little use in those instances where,
putting the very best construction upon them that we can, the black look is not to be
got over. We may, perhaps, recommend their adoption in the Court of Chancery,
where, if they can throw a light upon any of the dark doings of that dismal abode,
the Diurnal Reflectors would be above all Price, and above all PRICE’s candles.
THE ELEPHANT TO THE RIGHT HON. BENJAMIN
DISRAELI.
“SIR,-While serenely munching my carrot in my Pºlº here, Zoological
Gardens, Regent's Park, I looked over the shoulder of a visitor, deep in, your
speech-(upon which, Benjamin, you were beaten)-touching the present to be
made of the four seats in Parliament taken from Sudbury and St. Alban's. You
said, with a sneer, some persons §§ suggest that representation might be given,
among other bodies, to the Zoological Society. -
“Sir, I accept the sneer; and am ready to contend that no body is .50 º
of representation in the Commons. House of Parliament as the body Zoological.
Of course this assertion will be placed to my vanity, my selfishness. Sir, I, am
above the littleness of finesse; I have no false modesty; my skin does not admit
of a blush (a fact that, ..". considered, must have its advantages). And I at
once allow that, representation being given to our Gardens, I, the Elephanti.am
the individual with overpowering claims upon the constituency. There is, I believe
it, not a marmozet that would not give me his vote: I say give it; at which let
electors of St. Alban's and Sudbury blush till they are as red in the face as the
red-faced, azure-seated baboon. -- - - -
"Sir, nature made me the brute model of the human politician, the biped
statesman. In the first place, I am grave—very grave; none of my family, from
the first elephant that plucked his own first fan from the palms of Eden, was ever
known to make a joke: I am serious, heavy. Some of º tribe may have danced-
so did once an English Čhancellor—but wit I despise. . The nearest approach to a
joke ever perpetrated by any of us was, when an ancestor of mine, in a frolicsome
moment, stamped out the bowels of a too familiar keeper: the only practica
witticism we have upon record.
“But, Sir, look at my trunk. Does it not, in its structure, represent the very
philosophy of statesmanship?. Contemplate, ponder, the
organic delicacy of that trunk; exquisitely, made to do
nothing in a straight line. Whether I am to pick up a
pin, or to uproot an oak, I can in no way attempt either
achievement but by a twist. Now, Sir, as a man—a Cau-
casian—and a CHANCELLOR of THE Éxcheques, in this
inevitable twist, have we not the time-honoured uses of all
politics? Is not the curve of beauty the curve of duty?
“Again, Sir, I can, at any time, carry a whole House
on my back-mo small advantage to one who would fain
be a Minister, but who is at this present writing,
“Yours, Only AN ELEPHANT.
“P.S.. I will not brag about purity—try me, that is all.
WALPolº has said, I am told, that every man has his
price. Well, every Elephant has his cakes and oranges.”
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER'S
MEASURE.-A QUERY.
WITII fairness and justice in view,
Observing the proverb of yore,
DISRAELI, I’ll give you your due;
But, BEN, I must not give you more.
The truth I will willingly tell;
Your speech on the Budget'did show
That you know our financial state well,
And can clearly relate what you know.
To so much its merit amounts;
And this may, moreover, be said,
That it proved you are up to accounts,
And possess'd of a decent “chalk head.”
But facts can be cleverly strung,
And statements with neatness combined,
By many a voluble tongue,
The tool of a versatile mind.
You talk very finely—could we
With talking alone be content;
But what I am waiting to see,
My buck, is your power to invent.
PEEL's scheme has work'd well, you admit;
That system can you supersede
Bring forward a better than it,
And I’ll own you are clever indeed.
But glibly howe'er you may talk,
To render such praise I refuse;
If all you can do is to walk
In his steps whom you used to abuse.
Improve that course, still, if you can,
Though you may no better devise;
And I’ll own }. a sensible man,
If not superhumanly wise.
But look not for credit immense,
For just plainly stating the side
Of truth, which, if you've common sense,
You knew all the while you denied.
No Compromise-No Surrender.
CoMPROMise is the great principle in the affairs of the
British nation, says the EARL OF DeRBY. There is, how-
ever, Lord DERby should remember, a species of com-
promise that won't do. That is to say, there is such a
thing as compromising a felony, and any compromise that
involves robbing the people of their bread is very much
like it.
Another Problem Solved.
SoME persons have expressed surprise that though we
have a Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, and a
Royal Academy of Music, neither of these Royal Academies
has any extraordinary, renown reflected upon it by any of
its pupils. We can only regard the fact as an illustration
ll of the truth of the old saying, that there is no Royal Road
to learning, and the Arts are not to be, approached by a
Royal Road more easily than any other object of study.

HONOURABLE AMENDS TO SIR HARRY SMITH.
... We have been requested to publish the subjoined apology, as a model of one which
is certainly due:-
&btrtas I, HENRY G. GREy, otherwise EARL GREy, lately of the Colonial
Office, Downing Street, did, out of a mean anxiety to avert from the Whig ad.
ministration odium which it had incurred in a great measure from the management
of that, department of it over which I presided, write, a most ungenerous, an
unjustifiable letter to SIR HARRY SMITH, late Governor of the Cape of Good Hope,
recalling him from his office, and accusing him of having failed in showing foresight
energy, and judgment: I hereby offer the said SIR HARRY SMITH a PUBLIC an
HUMBLE Apology for the same. , I freely confess that I did not know what
I, was writing about, when I made those charges against, SIR HARRY SMITH,
which, according to the DUKE of WELLINGTON, were wholly unfounded, and am
very sorry I did not ask the opinion of that illustrious Commander before expressing
myself to the prejudice and dishonour of a gallant officer, on a subject whereon
I was not qualified to form an opinion. I beg SIR HARRY SMITH to forgive me
my unhandsome behaviour, to which I was driven by the fear of losing office alone,
and which I should never have been guilty of if I had not expected he would fail,
but, which, now, that he has succeeded, I sincerely repent. Having made this
public acknowledgment of my error, I entreat SIR HARRY SMITH will use his
influence to prevent my hearing anything more on the subject, whether in the
House of Lords or in Punch.

SIC ITUR AD Astra.-The celebrated ARAgo has resigned his office as director
of the French Observatory, rather than take the oath of ſidelity to the French
Dictator. This noble act is a proof that Louis NAPOLEON's lucky star is not among
those that the honest astronomer can recognise.
LOUIS NAPOLEON SOLOMON |
THE ARCHBishop of PARIs—and churchmen never flatter
—has placed the PRESIDENT in a parallel with SoLoMon.
It was given for SolomoN to build and consolidate more
than DAVID: it is reserved for Louis NAPOLEoN to do more
than the mere NAPOLEoN. Well, Solomon had his gifts of
cocks; SoLoMon NAPQLEoN has his present of an eagle:
º: it is; an eagle offered him º rench Army, on his
visit to the banquet prepared for him—
“An enormous eagle, whose wings and tail were composed of sabres,
the talons of horse-pistols, the eyes of tri-coloured cockades, and the beak
of the hammers of percussion locks."
Not one of SolomoN's peacocks was much like this bird—
a bird that, with its cariiivorous propensities, would eat how
many bodies on a battle-field P. For this was the very eagle
that took its supper at Austerlitz—the very eagle that, once
upon a time, settled upon the cliff at Boulogne, gazed and
screamed across the ocean-screamed and gazed, and then,
turned its tail of sabres, expanded its sabre wings, and flew
another way. Par tibi, says the Archbishop to the French
Army—and the French Army offer an eagle of sabres, and
pistols, and percussion-locks, as a responsive peace-offering!
Precious Metal and Precious Mess.
Owing to the attractions of the Australian diggings, the
shepherds of the whole country are deserting their flocks,
and it is to be feared that the consequence will be the
destruction of the sheep. Abundance of gold itself will thus
be the cause of distress; and unless something is done to
remedy this state of things, we shall soon experience a
peculiar and unpleasant illustration of the present “Great
cry and little wool.”

It is said that the American Expedition to Japan will

GOLD IN ENGLAND.
(PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL 1)
[FROM AN UNCONSCIOUS CORRESPONDENT.]
“Bustard Inn, Salisbury Plain, May (Date not legible).
"DEAREST ELIZA,
“I HAVE now been here a week, and it is all truer and truer–
all-all—that Roger declared to us. All—but say nothing. Say
nothing, my treasure, but only think what you'll have! A door-scraper
of gold—a knocker of the virgin metal—whatever you will, only be a
woman, and, as long as you can, keep the secret; for any way it won’t
last." This morning the Bishop of * * * arrived with a pickaxe,
a cradle, and a Mackintosh sack. It is now only four o'clock, and he
has returned to the inn to salmon and lamb-chops (people can't be par-
ticular here) to dinner, with five-and-twenty ounces. But so it is—ALL
SALISBURY PLAIN, THE whole BREADTH of IT, and as for the
depth, Nobopy PRETENDs To PATHoM IT-IS ONE MASS OF GOLD,
with just a thin coat of green grass over it ! When this fact becomes
fºll, known in London, won’t the City be a wilderness! Already,
can count ten, distinguished stockbrokers in Guernsey-frocks,
navigators' overhauls, and gutta-percha wide-awakes. Our neighbour,
MR.URIAH MUCKMAMMON-you know he had left home on a visitation,
as his wife said, having a call at the Land's End—well, here he is, with
a beard as long as a prophet's, in a suit of doeskin, and sleeping out at
nights in a tent, with saddle-bags full of gold-dust for a pillow. When
the news has fairly got wind, I dread to think on the skrimmages
that’ll happen.
“Wonderſul are the ways of fate | Here has Salisbury Plain been
É. gold for thousands of years—for I’m told it takes at least five
undred years to grow an ounce of scale-gold, whilst two or three
thousand, at least, go to the raising of nuggets—(a nugget, my
#.". is a lump of virgin ore, about as big as a respectable potato)—
ere has been this very Plain, with the Druids in their white linen
gowns (as you once saw 'em at Covent Garden in Norma), cutting their
mistletoes and performing their church-service, with never so much as
a notion of the glory that was under 'em.
“As it pours with rain, and I’ve done my thirty ounces to-day, I will
snatch a few minutes from PLUTUs to give to the wife of my bosom.
Wºl. I han’t told you how the gold was first found out—but this
18 lu.
“MR. * * * (as the post’s no longer safe from here, I don't name
some names), a most respectable lawyer of Salisbury, much given to
sheep, if only for their parchment, used to come up here to stay at the
Bustard, and, to take his walks and contemplations on the Plain,
thinking, no doubt—for he has the credit of being uncommon serious—
of this world and the others. MR. * * * *, as I’ve said, having a fancy
for sheep, was partic'larly struck with one black-faced wether; that
somehow would look at MR. * * * * just as his late partner (a very
sharp practitioner, but now defunct) used to look across the desk, in
his office days and bus'ness-hours, right at him. There is among
heathen people a notion that some folks that die come back to this
world again, upon all fours, as beasts. Well, MR. * * * * looking in
the black face of that wether-only his fancy, of course—did think the
sheep a striking likeness to his partner. But when the wether went
bolt up to a lump or boss in the ground, and kept licking and lickin
it, and looking up and looking up in the face of MR. * * * *, as muc
as to say, “how nice,” and with every look and every smack of the
mouth, looking more and more like the aforesaid late partner, MR.
* * * * followed the sheep, and saw a lump of bright yellow stuff in
the midst of stone, with the grass licked clean off it. Well, being
above the greed of gold, MR." " " ", just for the curiosity of the
thing, goes back to the Bustard, and says nothing, but borrows a pick-
axe , with, which he picks off a lump of about twenty pound, which
he puts in his handkerchief, and takes back with him to his room in
Salisbury, still saying nothing.
“The next day,one of the Canons of the Cathedral calls on MR. * * * *
about Church bus'ness. (Four boys had been put in the Ecclesiastical
Court for playing at hºyºhalfpenny in the Cloisters.) Well, there lay
the lump of yellow stuff, MR. * * * * thinking nothing about it; for
to him it was shining lumber-nothing better. “Hallo,” says the
Canon, surprised out of himself, why, that's a lump of gold-yea,
[. of Ophir!’, ‘Not of Ophir,’ says the simple-minded attorney,
cause I knocked it off with a pickaxe from a bigger lump, on the
Plain.” “Bless me!’ cried the Canon, “you don't say so!’. ‘Qn the
Plain,” º the simple lawyer; “but as for gold, why, that’s impos-
sible.” “Well, now I look again,” says the Canon, “it’s rubbish—yes,
nothing more than pyrites of iron, with mica, schistus, rag, rubble, and
a dash of pudding-stone.” “I know nothing of these things,” said the
lawyer; and began to look out some papers; whereupon the Canon
remembered, that he'd got a particular a § (how he'd come
to forget it, he couldn't tell) with his Lordship the Bishop; and so the
case, of brawling in church, otherwise the case of shove-halfpenny,
must for a day or two stand over. The very next morning, a
man as like the Canon as the Canon's two thumbs are like one
another—was seen with a donkey and panniers, a pickaxe, and
a spade, taking their way like two pilgrims across the Plain. For
a whole week the Canon's knocker was tied up with an old black
kid-leather ſº and straw laid down afore the door; he was
so dreadful ill with jaundice. Then another Canon fell sick; and then
another; then a Prebend, and then a Dean; that, anybody not in
the secret, would have thought the whole established Church of
Salisbury was in the hands of the doctors! But not a bit of it—every
one of 'em, for all the muffled knockers and the straw—every one of
'em was perspiring away on Salisbury Plain, as if they were turning
up pºtatoes of virgin gold at the diggings!
“And still the secret leaks out, and every hour brings new arrivals.
You can't think who's here dressed for the mines. In the M.
}. sent me I read that –, and —, and twenty other M.P.s,
ad, ‘paired off: yes-and here they are, with not even the time to
wash themselves, rocking their cradles, and bringing up thumping
fortunes.
“I’ve done very well—altogether about 1000 ounces of virgin ore:
I hope to make the 1000 ounces 10,000 before the Plain gets full wind,
when, I take it, the rush will be dreadful. At present it’s certain that
Mr. bismºi"knows nothing about it, or wouldn't he dissolve Parlia-
ment f l hate slander; but the EARL OF D**By was said to be laid
up last week with the gout; and yet, such is the malice of human
nature, when hungry for gold, a miner—a tall, fiery-looking man—was
yesterday pointed out to me as the noble Earl—his valet doing the
part of his master in London in his flannels. By this you may imagine
the state of morals that gold has brought us to lf gold is the root of
evil, England will be fuller and fuller of wickedness!
“The day before yesterday there was a dreadſul riot. A barrister of
high standing (a real Q. Q.) was charged with entering the tent of
DocTOR , a Prebend of St. —, London, and stealing from the
goldbags of the Reverend Gentleman, who showed fight with a courage,
as a brother divine and miner observed, worthy of the cause.
“All things are getting dreadfully dear, which has brought down
upon us a crowd of suttler-women, who wish to pass themselves off as
the lower orders. But it won't do; there's more than one born lady
who sells rum to the miners at half-a-sovereign a glass; whilst
champagne has gone off at two ounces the bottle—the corks drawn by
an Earl's daughter! -
“Gambling is beginning to show its hydra-head. Three M.P.s. (I
won't name names, but they are all pairers-off) have started a table
with pea-and-thimbles; and, call as you will, there is no police.
“Since I began my letter—for I’ve been called away a dozen times—
one entire side of Holywell Street has arrived; and I hear all the
Minories may be expected to-morrow. -
“In another month, and London will be a skeleton city. In the
meanwhile, I shall trust in fate and my pickaxe, and am off for an hour
or two, before might sets in, to rock my cradle.
“Your affectionate Husband,
“P.S. Three Members of the Archaeological Society have arrived;
and—assured of the treasure that will turn up—have determined to
blast Stonehenge to-morrow.”
Mr. Punch gives this letter as communicated to him at the last
moment before going to press. Hence, Mr. Punch has not time, to
verify, or disprove, any of the statements made by, the writer; but
Mr. Punch cannot refrain from calling upon the philosophic mind of
London to endeavour to imagine the moral revolution—the topsy-
turviness of all respectability, the chaos of all time-honoured conven-
tionalities, that would inevitably take place-were, it to be discovered
that Salisbury Plain was really and tangibly a Plain of Gold ! Mr.
Punch must be #. to shudder at the consequences to London
morals and London society.
A Shower of Benedictions.

Uncommon DISAGREEABLE A-DRIVING DOWN TO HEpsom l’”
THE INCOME-TAX NEWER
DIES.
THE Income-Tax is carried on from
ear to year—handed over by one Par-
iament to another—with most mono-
tonous regularity. Such has been the
case with the Tories, who gave it to
the Whigs, who returned it again to
the Tories, who have now voted it
for another year, to be handed back
once more, probably, to, the Whigs.
The next Parliament will open busi-
ness with the Income-Tax, left it as a
legacy, by its predecessor—and, we
wish it joy of its succession. This
succession, moreover, bids fair to be
an endless one, and to descend from
generation to generation, like a pre-
cious heirloom. It seems to be like
S|those interminable tales which we read
—or rather, some one reads—in the
Magazines, and which go on for years,
never seeming to come to an end. By-
the-bye, it would not form an inappro-
priate Finis to the act that is published
every year for the continuation of the
Income-Tax, if there was always ap-
pended at the end of it the time-ho-
moured notice that is generally pinned
on to the end of every Magazine tale:—
“To be continued in our neart.”

MISS VIOLET AND HER “OFFERS.”

CHAPTER IX.
I wonDER why it is considered proper to make some apology for
being at Epsom on the Derby day. Nobody, ever seems inclined to
admit that the attractions of a lively day, and a fine sight, are satis-
factory reasons for going down, and it appears as necessary to have a
correct excuse for seeing the races as a correct card of the horses that run
them. I was quite amused with the various justifications which I heard
offered by all sorts of people the last time we went down, which was
last year. I do not think º: cared about providing himself with an
excuse, but if we had wanted one, we might have said, selon les régles,
that Aunt HESTER had come up from Wales with her two daughters;
her husband, MR. DE STRINGAs, who is a country lawyer, having
been obliged to, stay, in London to answer some election-petition
accusations. I think he was charged with having returned his man by
bribing the chambermaid of the hotel, where twenty of the opposite
voters were imprisoned, to fill all the jugs in the bedrooms with
whiskey instead of water; and the consequence was, that on the day of
ll, every one of the twenty was found in a state of stupefaction, and
incapable of even muttering the name of the gentleman they ought to
have supported. I think, too, Uncle DE STRINGAs was suspected of
having got up a panic, which caused a run upon the country bank where
the enemy's funds had been deposited; so that the bankers were obliged
to Pº. depositors the money intended for bribing, and two days were
lost, before any fresh supplies could be sent down from the Pall Mall
Club. I know that his talents are very highly esteemed in his county,
and Aunt HestER always wears a beautiful emerald and pearl brooch,
presented to her by the neighbouring gentlemen, in commemoration
of Uncle's spirited behaviour, when the Speaker of the House of
Commons was reprimanding him for violently tearing all the signatures
off the petition against his friend. He is the most good-natured, kind-
hearted creature in the world, and I am sure that, on the Downs, you
might have heard his laugh from the hill to the Grand Stand.
y cousins, KATE and Louisa, are both Fº girls, on rather a
large scale, and perhaps with a little too much of that swing and sauc
manner which grows upon girls who are made a good deal of in small
circles. But when they come into the world they are shy, almost to
stiffness, until they—what they are pleased to call—“know” a person,
and then they say anything and everything that comes into their heads.
They are dear girls, both of them, and have as fº tempers as their
papa, and sometimes laugh nearly as loudly. As for AUNT HESTER,
she only lives for two things—to make her family happy, and to copy
all the riddles she can meet with into the fly-leaves of a great old copy
of Fox's Book of Martyrs, and on the backs of the painful pictures.
When we were visiting her, papa altered the inscription under one of
the engravings, and made it read, “MR. Jº Jones cruelly whip'd
by Bishop BonneR, for tº. § to reveal why a kitten in walnut-
ji. was like the General Post Office.” .
Our carriage was moored nearly opposite the Grand Stand, in
an excellent pl (where I dare, say we shall be seen while Little
Harry and Claverhouse are running), and everybody came to speak
to us between the races. , ALBANY, you may be sure, was down
before we were, and rendered most invaluable service, getting the
carriage into the front, suggesting all kinds of clever arrangements
for lunch, keeping vigilant guard over us, and driving away all the
sullen-looking people, who come to snatch the shawls, parasols, and
handkerchiefs, while the owners are watching the running. He even
got rid of the gipsies in shorter time than anybody else could, and
yet without flying into a rage. , Besides, he named the horses to us as
they cantered to the starting-place (though I do not believe we, or one
person in a thousand, recognised any one of the creatures as they came
rushing back), arranged sweepstakes between each race, and toldus who
had won almost the instant the thing was over. He was in capital
spirits, and his straightforward, frank, unaffected manner showed to
great advantage, as the drawlers and loungers, and men who pretended
to be used .# arrived, one after another. As for my cousins, they
both declared that, they were hopelessly in love, with ALBANy; and
Louisa, in particular, did nothing but call out to him to bring her
this, and to tell her that, and to help her to the other thing, the whole
afternoon. But .. he was scrupulously attentive, I do not think
that he gave her much encouragement, and he contrived to be on my
side of the carriage quite as much as was necessary. AUNTY HESTER, I
believe, saw exactly how matters were, and once when Louis A was
crying out, “O, MR. SwellingtoN you must come here this instant
and tell me something,” she said,
“I think, dear, you might as well let MR. SweLLINGTON alone.”
And then she looked straight at me for a moment, with a very quiet
little smile, and the next moment H. to be "f deep in the
advertisements on the back of MR. DoRLING's card. I knew that she
had too much good sense to say anything, but I was in perpetual fear
lest one of my riotous cousins should shout out what in the country

º call “hints,” but which sound like most awkwardly plain-speaking in
Indon.
“Here, Violet, here comes another of your beaur,” (I could never cure the
country girls of that word,) cried KATE, giving me a push, as little SIR FINGAL
MERwyn, of the Grenadier Guards, came up, looking dreadfully hot, but greatly
pleased with himself for something he had achieved.
“How de doo?” he asked; “delightful day!yes—I can't raise my hat, I’m sorry
to say, because it's full of Napoleons, and pincushions, and money-boxes, which would
come raining over my shoulders, Great knocking down! tremendous!—Thank you
yery much; it looks as if it had been invented expressly to meet my emergency.”
This latter acknowledgment referred to agreen glass of Hock, with a piece of Wenham
Lake ice in it, which papa handed down, compassionately, to SIR Fingal.
“You are the real original good Samaritan, MR., BRompton,” said the British
Grenadier, as he gave the glass to the servant; “and I won't be ungrateful, because
ingratitude is unbeseeming and unbecoming.” And he stooped very low to take off
his hat without dropping its contents. “There, Miss BRompton, dome the favour
to accept a lemon—I knocked him over with my first stick, winning a sovereign
thereby from ATHANAsius BLEAT, the barrister, who may be a very good barrister,
but shies precious bad. Permit me to offer your friends the following trifles from
Epsom; namely, one jack-in-the-box, one—
“SIR FINGAL MERyyN, aunt,” I said, for I saw the girls were eager to secure
some of the Grenadier's #.
“Just so,” said SIR FINGAL, addressing her in the most good-humoured but
graveway; “and pray, let me present to youthis exemplary bodkin-case-substantial,
rather than showy, perhaps. To you (this was to KATE) this distinguished-lookin
pincushion-observe the red and gold—and to you (this to Louisa) this ...i
money-box: notice the real brass around the hole. And now I must go and give
the rest to the BARQNess FontañABIA, because she is going to take me to town.
And so, good-bye, with the same apology as before for not taking off my hat. How
are you, ALBANY P Want to do anything?”
“I never bet, now,” said MR. Swellington, very composedly. “But you are all
wrong, as you’ll find in a few minutes, for there goes the bell to clear the course.”
“Put us up, there’s a good one, if you’ve heard anything,” said the Grenadier,
very earnestly..."You always—”
ALBANY hastily whispered ºf which sent the officer away with a hasty
step and a blank face; and as soon as he was gone, KATE and Louisa began to

snatch at one another's presents, each declaring the other had got the best, and that
it was a shame, and the way she was always served.
s § covered into Aunt Hester's hand. “You must have
§§§ dropped it, when standing on the edge of the carriage. I
§§§ saw him dive.”
We made up our sweepstakes for the great race, and
ALBANY's hat being duly shaken, we all drew; Louisa
hesitating a long time at drawing, teasing ALBANY to draw
for her, and, finally, snatching a paper, with the appropriate
sentiment, “Well, here's luck!” I forget what my number
was, but ALBANY asked to see it, and I showed it him, upon
which he modded with evident pleasure, and told me to put
it away in my lemon. Upon this, Louisa, to please him by
taking his hint, put her paper unopened into her money-box,
and, of course, never knew what she had drawn.
Then came the time of suspense, broken only by the regular
incidents of the people who will cross the course, and are
sent back unless they can dodge the policemen; and of the
poor dog, whose nerves must be shaken for the whole follow-
ing year, by the frightful yelling which the rabbleraise as he
runs down the line. One really almost hates creatures who
are capable of making such noises, and for such a purpose.
And then came the false alarm, and then the cry, taken up
instinctively by thousands upon thousands; and then the
instants of strange excitement even to those who scarcely
knew the name º single horse in the struggle, and certainly
have not the leastinterest in the event. What these rushing
moments must be to a man who has a quiet home far away,
with a gentle, sorrowful wife, and poor little children in it,
and all their money in the world staked upon those maddening
horses, I am afraid to think. ALBANY will never bet again-
though I am sure I do not know why I write that here.
We were all standing up in and about the carriage, in-
tently watching the race, papa with a telescope, and some
of us with opera-glasses; and ALBANY had so, posted, him:
self, that there was certainly no danger of my falling. Round
rushed the horses, pattering and thundering, and a shifting
mass of shining silks, of various colours, confused the eye,
and defied one's powers of memory-blue cap and yellow
sleeves, and purple cap and white sleeves, and green cap and
ultra-marine sleeves—each might be anybody's and every-
body’s colours for all I could recollect. Another moment
or two, and all was over, and hundreds of thousands of
pounds, all over the kingdom, had changed owners. .
“What’s the number, ALBANY P’’ said papa, trying to
bring his telescope to bear upon the great figure they were
hanging out. -
“Miss BroMPtoN has it in her lemon,” said MR. ALBANY.
And to my surprise, the next moment he sprang from the
carriage, dived under another, and presently came out,
dragging a savage-looking man, buttoned up to the neck,
and ºf no rim to his hat. The man strove to get away,
but clearly had not the slightest chance. ALBANY brought
him up to the carriage. -
“Something of yours, MRs. DE STRINGAs, this person
has to return.”
“Of mine!” said my aunt, in great surprise. “I have
not lost anything.” -
“He is one of those ingenious people who find, things
which are not exactly lost,” said ALBANY. “Produce it,
my man.” -
The man scowled, and shook back his head sulkily, but
did not obey. -
“As you please,” said ALBANY. “This way, then.”
And holding his prisoner with a firm grasp, he drew him
some paces from the carriage, when an apparition ap-
proached which changed the plans of the captive. . It was
a mounted policeman, who, at ALBANY’s signal, came
galloping up. - - - - -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EQUALITY OF NAMES.
Y great ingenuity
our zetetic and
antiquarian con-
temporary, Notes
and Queries, de-
rives the very
plebeian name
of SNooks from
the rather pa-
trician one of
SE v EN o Aks.
We can under-
stand how the
- one degenerated
into the other. Sevenoaks, SE'NoAKs, SNOAKS, SNooks. No doubt many
another name may have been corrupted in the same way, and, vulgar as
it is thought now, mº be traceable to the root of a high family tree,
There is BUGGINs. That evidently comes from BURGoyNE. As thus:
BURGoyNE, BURGoyNE’s (the son of BURGoyNE), BURGONs, BUGGONs,
BugGINs. What confirms this view, is the fact that we find HIGGINs,
a cognate patronymic, in the transition state-like a frog with a tail,
not quite changed from tadpole—spelt Higgons, in course of decline
from Hugo; as Hugo, Hugo's, HugoNs, HUGGONS, HIGGons, HIGGINs.
Trom the same origin is also manifestly derived HUGGINs—formed in
some particular instance instead of HUGGONs from HUGONs. There can
be . question that BRowN comes from BIRON or ByRon ; and that
not very remotely—BYRON, B'RoN, BRowN. BRIGGs may easily be
deduced from Mowbray. One of the early Mowbrays, who could
read and write imperfectly, spelt his name Mowbrag, confoundin
Y with G. A descendant of his, very subject to influenza, used to cal
himself Bow BRAG. In course of time, an elision occurred, first of the
w, making BoBRAG, and then of the o, reducing the name to BBRAG, with
two B's; as that of FRENch is sometimes written FFRENCH. A
subsequent member of the family, who was not a man of letters, struck
off a B, and cut it down to BRAG : another, more addicted to letters
than literature, added a G, and made it BRAGG., By the conversion of a
vowel, it became BRIGG: lastly, some gentleman bearing it, who
rejoiced in the genitive case or the plur -
and thus Mowbray sunk, through various stages of decadence, into
BRiggs. In the same manner, it would not be very difficult to trace
Pott up to PLANTAGENET. -
These considerations show that there is not so much difference be-
tween the Nobility and the Mobility as the former imagine; and further,
that the SNookses and BRiggses, and other individuals of the º
may boast, with truth, of the very longest pedigrees, inasmuch as it
has required many generations for such names as BRIGGs and SNooks
to descend from Sevenoaks and MoWBRAY.
STARVATION FOR THE DELICATE.
That exquisite young officer, CAPTAIN GANDAw, was reading a
newspaper, when his brilliant eye lighted on the following passage in a
letter which had been written to the journal by MR. MEchi, on the
subject of “Irrigation.”
“I may be thought rather speculative when I anticipate that within a century from
this period, the sewage from our cities and towns will follow the lines of our lines of
railway, in gigantic arterial tubes, from which diverging veins will convey to the
eager and distant farmer the very essence of the meat and bread which he once pro-
duced at so much cost.' -
“Fancy,” remarked the gallant Captain, “the sewage of towns and
cities being the essence of owabwead and meat—and of beeaw too...of
cawse, as beeaw is made from gwain'. How vewy disgasting ! Mr.
MEchi expects that his ideas will be thought wathaw speculative. He
flattas himself. They will only be consida’d vewy dawty. The wetch!
I shall be obliged to abjaw byead, and confine myself to Iwish potatoes
—which are the simple pyoductions of the awth—and avoid ali animal
food but game and fish. ...And when fish and game are not in season,
I shall be unda the necessity of westwicting my appetite to
“A scwip with hawbs and foruits supplied,
And wataw fivom the spwing."
Gold and the Looking-Glass.
LIEUTENANT-ColoneL MUNDY—in his capital book, Our Antipodes
—tells us that quicksilver was in such demand for the Bathurst mines,
to fix the metal, that old looking-glasses were bought up, and their
“silver lining” º: off. There is nothing new even at the An-
tipodes 1 . For how often has Beauty, employed the quicksilver of her
glass, and only for the purpose of “fixing” so much gold P

UNREPORTED ILLUMINATIONS.
THE Illuminations in honour of HER MAJESTY's birthday were this
year of a more significant character than the reader of the newspapers
is perhaps aware. Our contemporaries, it is true, have devoted their
accustomed two columns to their usual report, but we have sufficient
reason to believe that theirs is by no means what MR. DoRLING would
term a “correct list.” We have long suspected, indeed, that these two
columns were mere annual stereotypes; and wishing distinctly to
ascertain the fact, we this year started a special Penny-a-liner of our
own, with instructions to spare no expense in cabs to obtain the fullest,
truest, and most particular account. And we now fearlessly challenge
the entire press to show “copy” of the following items, which we
extract at random from his note-book:—
“LoRD SEYMoUR's mansion was illuminated in the choicest taste.
It displayed a transparency of the Crystal, Palace, arranged as a dis-
solving view, with a prominent outline in the foreground of his lord-
ship's favourite pump.
“Colonel. SIBTHöRP showed a similar device; with, in lieu of the
ump, a full-length portrait of himself. The latter enveloped in a
laze of Triumph.
“The residence of the SoLIcitor-GENERAL was illuminated with
the Transparency of a Distressed Agriculturist: a rather substantial
shadow, but painted in, the palest colours, and fading almost imper-
ceptibly away. Beneath, the inscription—'I am starving”—on an
exceedingly rich ground.
“The CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER displayed, as usual, a
number of ingenious devices. That which elicited the most admiration
Was a º representation of the Budget : the figures all en
couleur de rose, and wreathed in corn-flowers, with the motto—“Let
Well Alone.”
“The EARL or DERBy’s official residence was most elaborately
festogned with variegated lamps; the upper story, especially being
very light. In the centre was a Janus-head, considered by some to
represent the Head of the Government. To the right, an Allegory—
‘Protection,’ dressed in the Coat of Office, with its finger naively ſaid
upon its lips and a corn-ucopia beside it, ſabelied "Free’” to th: left,
a distant view of the Mansion House, with the proverb ‘On revient
toujours à ses PREMIER's amours,’ indistinctly traced in party-coloured
amps.
“Several of the Protectionist Members displayed a single star—the
Star of Hope—but these were mostly very dim, and in many cases
quite gone out.
... “It is needless to state that Mr. Punch's official residence was
illuminated in its accustomed simple but effective manner. The
illumination consisted merely of the pages of his last Number, which
were displayed as usual, in the window, and completely dazzled the
mind’s eye of every beholder.”
MILDNESS OF THE POLITICAL SEASON.
UCH is the extraordinary mildness of the
political season, that the DERby Ministry
is not yet nipped in the bud, notwith:
stand ; its constant exposure out of
doors during the day-time, and the
extremely variable atmosphere it ex-
periences in the forcing-house at night.
The wonder is, among political botanists
that a plant so extremely delicate should
have lived so long, especially after its
having lost its hold upon the soil, since
it has undergone the process of trans-
plantation from the country flats to the
warm beds of the Treasury.
It is to be doubted whether it can
ever become a healthy and hardy
plant, for it has been reared under
the cover of an artificial Protection,
which is injurious to progress, and has
unfitted it for that free exposure to
the open air which is so necessary to vigour and vitality.

OH reedy pipes, and drum! resound
With blended thump and trill,
That cause the heart to bound,
And midriff thrill !
Hymn the grand Derby Day,
The jolliest of the jolly month of May!
A wretch profane and base art thou
Whom business to thy stool doth glue,
So that thou dost that festival allow
To pass without observance due.
e love of gain thy spirit binds,
Oh slave of Avarice!
The most pernicious vice
To mortal minds.

An infinite lot of mokes, and cobs, and nags;
Conveying Swell and Nob, -

And every grade beside;
So we go down, , , .
Laughing, talking, joking,
With costermonger smoking,
Fast man upon Town,

And yet more blooming lasses,
Smiling in your best array, -
On either side the whilst our chariot passes!
And you, ye boys, who load the fragrant breeze,
Shouting “ Hip, hip, hip, hooray!”

Clouds of dust the eye assail, - -

And like the speckled lazy-crawling snail,
Away they go!

Now they are off—at last—
Gently a first—then fast -
As the fleet WIND-KING—WINKIN called in

Scarce slower than electric fire,
Speeds on the telegraphic wire.

Increasing clamours rend the air

On the thimble-rigging knaves,

And roam among the booths to shy at toys,
As we were wont to do in days of yore,
When we were boys.
Laden with our childish booty,
Back we wend at close of day,
"Mid inextinguishable noise;
And our spoils to Youth and Beauty

Until we doze;

our we wait,
“IMPROMPTU DINNERS.”
AN Advertisement with the above
heading annoys us daily. We are
by no means gourmands, but we
cannot say we relish the idea of an
impromptu dinner. The very, word
“impromptu’” seems inevitably to
imply, haste. ... Now, if
\ there's one thing more
than another that an En-
glishman hates to hurry
over, it is unquestionably
his dinner. The suggestion
is, therefore, nationally
repugnant to our taste. In
America we could fancy
“impromptudinners” would
be in great request. Cele-
rity is there the motto of
the people, and nowhere
is the spirit of go-aheadism
more conspicuously mani-
fested than at the dinner-
º
º
table.
Intrinsically, by no means would we depreciate these dinners. We
have never tasted, and, therefore, cannot judge, them. But nominally,
we must repeat, the notion is to us a disagreeable one. And if ever we
are asked to an impromptu dinner, we shall certainly stipulate that it
be what Molière calls “un impromptu, fait a loisir.”
A Blessed President
THE ARCHBishop of PARIs has been blessing the busts of Louis
NAPOLEoN. This is quite proper, for we should have to wait a long
time, we are afraid, before we heard any of the people say, “Bless his
dear face l’”
FLINGING SATIRE IN A MAN'S FACE.
A DEPUTATION waited, upon LoRD JoHN MANNERs to tell him all
about the stagnant and dangerous condition of the Serpentine, and to
ask for some remedy. MR. LILWALL expressed himself as very con-
fident that
“The crying evil would at length be remedied, seeing that his Lordship, who had
always expressed himself as so desirous to promote the healthful recreation of the
people, was at the head of that department which pre-eminently gave his Lordship the
means of carrying out that desire.”.
We are afraid M.R. LILwall has mistaken the means of softening a
Minister's heart; Rock as it may be, satire is not the kind of acid that
will melt it. And what greater satire than to tell Lord John
MANNERs that he was, ‘‘so desirous to promote the healthful recreation
of the people /* And this only a week after his memorable speech and
vote in favour of the demolition of the Crystal Palace! It’s too bad
to fling burning satire like this in a man's face | It's worse than
vitriolic acid.
The Hero of one Battle-Field.
ON the occasion of the review in the Champ de Mars, the PREsi DENT
wore the uniform of a General of the Infantry—or of a Colonel of the
National Guard—for, as he has never served in either, it is extremel
doubtful which uniform he wore, or, in fact, what rank in the Frenc
army he has gained at all, beyºnd that, from never having been in it, of
a Rank Impostor. As these doubts make it very inconvenient to know
what military title to give him, we i. that Louis NAroLEoN do
take his title from that of the only battle-field in which he has hitherto
º himself, and be henceforth known as “the Great SHAM
e Mars.” * .
The Cup that Inebriates, but does not Cheer.
..WHEN LOUIs. NAPOLEoN has declared himself. Fmperor, the cup of
his ambition will be completely full, for then it will amount to the
whole Imperial Measure for which he has so long been thirsting.

A GRAND DISAPPOINTMENT.
THE late events in Paris may
be characterised as a Grand Dis-
appointment.
IRst of all, * of the Army
was disappointed. They expected
an Emperor before the day was
half over; whereas in the even-
ing there was only a Prince Pre-
morning.
Secondly, the Orleanists were
disappointed, be-
cause they made
sure there would
have been a row
of some sort or
other, by which
they could not fail
to have profited;
whereas things
passed off so
quietly, that they
were no nearer
the throne after
the review than
they had beenbe-
fore it.
THIRDLY, the
Legitimists were
disappointed for
the same reason.
FourtHLY, the Republicans were on the look-out for a coup d'état,
and were in hopes that something good to their cause might come out
of it; but no coup d’état occurring, they were equally disappointed
with all the others. -
FIFTHLY, the foreigners and strangers, who flocked to Paris in the
strong expectation that the Empire was to be proclaimed, came away
terribly disappointed, declaring they had been seduced there under
false pretences, as nothing had taken place beyond a stupid review, of
which the dust took very good care to prevent them seeing anything.
And Lastly, Louis Napoleon was more disappointed than anyone
else, as he rose in the morning with the full certainty that the Army
would proclaim him. Emperor, and went to bed, at eight o'clock with
the unpleasant conviction that some one had made a slight mistake.
And the fact is, every one was disappointed, officers and soldiers
included. The officers, because they had several days' º deducted to
; the expenses of a fête that only ended in smoke; and the soldiers,
ecause they had all the hard work to do, without any of the feasting
that followed afterwards. They expected showers of champagne and
saucissons at least, but had nothing to swallow but dust and disap-
pointment. - - -
So, under all the circumstances, we think we are perfectly justified
in characterising the late Fêtes of Paris as a GRAND DisappoINTMENT.
SEASONABLE NOWELTY.
PARTIEs going to the Derby are recommended to provide themselves
with The Gentleman's Complete Chaffer; a neat duodecimo volume, fitted
for the waistcoat pocket, and containing upwards of 5000 choice bits of
“Chaff,” suitable for all emergencies. Among its contents will be
found a great variety of waggeries for the drag, railleries for the rail,
and downy sayings for the Downs; together with an extensive assort.
ment of “sells” of a general utility. Also a number of new and original
proverbs on the approved model of “It’s all serene,” and not a whit
more sensible, it is hoped, than that now popular assertion. The whole
arranged alphabetically, with Index.

“The Complete Chafer most effectually advocates the Early Closing Movement.
It is astonishing how soon it shuts one up.”—Fast Gazette,
The Pawnbroker and the Emperor.
The lower orders of Berlin—we are told—took all they could to the
º; in the belief that, according to a general custom, the
MPEROR or Russia, on his visit to the city, would redeem the goods.
Thus, the Prussian poor took a lesson from Louis Napoleon, and
speculated-(though not with his luck)—upon their “Uncle.”

“Now, save you, my bolde Commissioneres,
And tell me how have ye fared;
Why are ye so foule, and why do ye scowle,
And wherefore lookeye scared?”
Then up and spake SIR JAMEs A-Woode,
“Small thanks to thee we owe,
That, in yon Cave, we founde not a grave,

THE NO-HOUSE OF COMMONS.
ONE of the most melancholy results
of the No-House on Tuesday, the
18th of May, is the extreme activity
that has been given to the small joke
market, by the fact of there not having
been forty members present on the
occasion, in question. Every idle
tongue that can wag, has attempted
some waggery on its own very small
account, and some of the “transac:
tions”, have been, indeed, worthy of
the stocks” in a rural point of view;
for if any village stocks are yet to be
found, the perpetrator of a bad pun
ought, to be made the subject of an
immediate transfer into that low class
of security.
Two or three quotations will give a
sufficient idea of the disastrous results
that have ensued to common sense,
from the cause we have stated.
An, individual, who had formerly
moved in a respectable sphere, was
heard to observe, that if the Commons
occasionally made “No House,” they
could not get through the business of
the country “ No-Hows.”
Another individual, whose name we
suppress out of respect to an º:
grandmother, was no sooner told that
the House risen, because there
were not forty members present, than
he exclaimed, “Oh! can't they get
on without forty being present P But
I suppose the Commons are deter-
mined that, if they cannot always ob-
serve the suaviter in modo, they will at
least make sure of the forty-ter in re.”
Another individual, whose indiscreet
waggery has taken a sort of anti-privi-
legious turn, which may one day bring
him not, only to the bar of public
opinion, but to the bar of the House,
was rash º to remark, in the
hearing of our farthing-a-liner, “Ha!
it’s an odd coincidence that forty of
them should be required in order that
business may be proceeded with, for
we all know that there were exactly
forty thieves.”
Another still more degraded being,
who unites two professions, accord:
ing to the Johnsonian theory, and
who, being a punster by day, is—we
need not say what—by night, was so
far indifferent to all consequences
that in the hearing of an individua
with a horsewhip in his hand, he had
the rashness to remark, that “the busi-
ness of the session must be proceeding
very piano indeed, when the forts
cannot always be relied upon.”
We feel that we have somewhat
braved the indignation of the public in
bringing under, their notice these
evidences of mental infirmity; but per-
haps when the Commons see the dis-
turbance occasioned to a portion of the
public intellect by... the fact of there
being No House, it may render them
careful how they are guilty of such
laches again.

DR. CAHILL’S ULTRAMONTADE.
The Rev. Dr. CAHILL, or some maniac who writes under his signature, has-to descend
to vulgar phraseology—“tipped” the PREMIER, a “Junius. , Yes-for DR, CAHILL's epistles
—like those of Junius—are “full of sound and fury;” but then, to be sure, JUNIUs's
Letters contained something more. -
DR. CAHILL's object is twofold; so objects generally #. to a person in that condition
wherein he, apparently, writes. But CAHILL's objects are different one from the other—rather
different. One is to resent the proposed inquiry respecting Maynooth as an affront; the
other, to court that same investigation. We are afraid we are poaching on the manor of
in Foºs winslow in quoting the subjoined language, the discussion of which ma
appear considerably more suitable to the pages of “The Journal of Psychological Medicine”
than to those of Punch:—
“Judges of former times pronounced sentence without vulgar gibes, and the executioners of the law despatched
their victims without poisoning the edge of the axe, or steeping the rope in vitriol."
MR. CALCRAFT must not mind DR. CAHILL. M.R. CALCRAFT must see what a state of
mind he is in to insinuate that our modern executioners poison their axes, and steep their
º in sulphuric or nitric acid. Everybody knows that to poison an axe, in order to chop
off a head, would be a mere device to kill a dead man; an act of malice which would never be
thought of but by a frantic Irish priest, with a Protestant in his power, and having an axe, and
some poison at hand, but no fire. And, of course, no one in his senses would for a moment
believe that MR. CALCRAFT is so ignorant of the chemistry of hemp and of the mineral
acids, as to soak his halters in such fluids, and thereby destroy them, or convert them into
xyloidine, or a substance similar to gun-cotton.
Nor must the sages of the Law, any more than its finisher, be offended with DR, CAHILL.
No one imagines that LoRD CAMPBELL and his learned brethren are accustomed to chaff
the culprits whom they condemn—to mistake the black cap for the fool's. The poor man,
perhaps, confounds the present with the past. He may remember that there were certain
judges who used to deliver over a heretic to be roasted alive, with an ironical request
that he might be dealt with without bloodshed.
As to DR. CAHILL, it is useless to reason with him, to ask what headsman, with any
head of his own, would poison an axe, when he might poison a lancet; what Jack Ketch
would be such a booby as to subject his rope to corrosion? Therefore, we would discard
the idea of the rope in connexion with that of treason, as suggested by such stuff as this:
“No, Sir, the inquiry which is offered in insult will, and must, eventuate in our advantage. We can well
defend our theology. We teach the theology of France, to which the Russells, the PALMERsroxs, the DERBYs,
the WEllingtons, and the TRUhos of France, bent uncovered to the earth on the 10th of May, in the Champs
de Mars. Do you understand me, Lond DERby ? We teach the discipline and the doctrine to which 60,000 of the
French host, clad in steel, bent the knee on the 10th of May,
amid the discharge of 100 pieces of French ordnance. Are
gou listening to me, my Lord? We teach the treatises which
Austria teaches, where your nation has been openly and
publicly insulted, where your ambassador is at this moment
barely tolerated, and where the person called “Our own Cor-
respondent' is no longer permitted to publish his foul anti-
Catholic slanders from Vienna to London.”
With horror, loathing, shame, and indigmation,
have, we read of Roman Catholic, priests, in
Elizabethan times and since, half-hanged, and
ripped up alive. Such atrocities we blushed, for
as chargeable on Protestant persecution, albeit
resulting from those
“Bloody instructions, which being taught, return
To plague the inventor.”
But DR. CAHILL's effusions induce us rather
to suspect that those cruelties should be imputed,
simply, to the defective psychology of the period,
which could not distinguish between the insane
Roman Catholic priest and the popish traitor.
Mad doctors of Romish divinity may then, as
now, have threatened their government with
foreign arms, and have received their answer on
the scaffold.
If we thought that CAHILL had the least sound
portion of brain i.; we would seriously
remonstrate with him for labouring, as it would
seem, to bring odium on his party; which is
really too bad, especially at present. As it is, we
will only say that the Roman Catholics ought to
look after DR. CAHILL, or the person who writes
in his name; especially now that so much alarm
and irritation relative to Popery exist among the
ople of this country, who are apt to judge of a
ody by its leaders, and are very loth to admit the
plea of insanity as an excuse either for felony or
constructive treason.

ANOTHER AFFAIR OF HONOUR.
XTRAORDINARY as it may ap-
pear, the following correspond-
ence has just been put into our
hands, with full permission to
make what use we please of
it. Having first offered it
to a butterman who refused to
name a price for it, we beg
leave to present it to our
readers:-
“Gander and Egberts,
# past 3 P.M.
“MR. DIMITY presents his
compliments to MR. WHITEY
BR.own, and has been requested
by MR, LAVENDER KIDDs, to
inquire whether MR. WHITEY
Brown admits the remark at-
tributed to him, with reference
to the influence of MR. LA-
vender Kipps on the female
customers to the lace and fancy department of our great establishment.
“G. and E’s, 20 minutes past 3 P.M.
“Mr. Lavexper Kipps begs to acknowledge the communication from Mr. Dºuty. MR. LAVENDER
Kupps adopts the remark attributed to him, with reference to MR. Whitey BRows, and refers MR.
DIMITY to M.R. GINGHAM Twill for any further explanation.”
These two letters were followed by an interview between Mr. Gingham Twill and MR. DiMity,
after which several letters passed, the object of which was a demand on the part of MR. DIMITY
that M. iºn Kippsºnould withdraw a certain adjective from a sentence he had made use of in
reference to Mr. Whitey Brown—a demand that MR. GINGHAM Twill refused to comply with in
the name of MR. Lavender KIDDs. - -
A meeting was accordingly arranged to take place between the parties on Saturday afternoon, on
Hampstead"Heath; and Mit. Lavenner KIDDs, accompanied by MR. GinghAM TVILL, arrived on
the Heath, vić Kentish Town, at the hour appointed, when they were met by MR, Whitey Brown,
attended by MR. Dimity, who had come by the direct route, per omnibus. -
The presence of such a considerable party ºxcited much attention on the Heath, and to avoid obser-
vation it was determined to strike into the furze bushes in the interior. To allay suspicion the party
artook of curds and whey previous to starting. There being only one mug, among the four, it was
}. inconvenient for the two principals to drink out of the same vessel, and there being a good supply
of spoons, the difficulty was got over, there being as many spoons as there were persons engaged in
the business. - -
One donkey carriage-and-pair having been chartered for the occasion, the driver was dispensed with,
and the two seconds led the two
donkeys by the nose—one prin-
cipal occupying the front seat and
the other the dickey. On reach-
ing the ground MR. Whitey
BR.own proceeded to measure it
deliberately with his yard mea-
sure, and atter a little conver-
ation between the seconds it
was arranged there should be—
instead of an exchange of shots
—an exchange of cigars, so that
there might be the usual termi-
nation of smoke to the duel. This
having been agreed to, MR. LA-
vender Kidds, after having received his antagonist's puffin his eye, declared himself perfectly satisfied.

THE ISLE OF SKYE AND THE GOLDEN FLEECE.
The RE are about twenty millions of sheepin Australia crying for shepherds. Sir CHARLEs TREvelyAN
avouches the fact... In the Island of Skye the whole population are in danger of perishing for want of
sustenance. Superfluous mutton on one hand, starving families on the other. What is needful for
sheep and men is simply this; to take the Isle of Skye and empty it into the Antipodes. -
Talk of playhouse pantomimes—here is a pantomime of real life to be worked; fairy transformations
not to end with the fall of the curtain, but, the transformation once effected, to be perpetuated
for generations. -
Every man with a sovereign to spare, with even half-a-sovereign, may make himself a real, benevolent,
twenty or ten-shilling magician. Nothing more easy. We will show it-show it pantomimically-
how the thing may be done.
Scene I-Isle of Skye; rocky and barren scenery; mists rolling up from the sea. . Population
scattered, emaciated, despairing. Hunger, and her attendant fiends prowl through the island. The
aspect of all things is that of hopelessness and desolation. - -

certain well-known persons, whose names brighten committees, pull to the shore. Other boats, con-
taining clothes and victuals, follow.

boats.
Scene 3.-Deck of the Golden
Fleece crowded with aforesaid inha-
bitants of Skye. Anchor weighed-
bagpipe sounded—and departure.
(Here may be imagined a very
beautiful moving panorama of sea and
sky; dolphins, flying fish, &c., &c.,
and ships ºn; and coming. Ap-
proach of land—land made; land con-
tinued until it stretches into the
Bush.)
Scene 4. — An extensive view of
the Bush; so extensive that hun-
dreds of Skye shepherds and families
are seen in various places; the afore-
said shepherds and families so ruddy
and º that their dearest creditors,
if they had any, would not know them.
Curtain falls to the music of bagpipes
playing Auld Lang Syne.
Now here is a pantomime that every
body, with even half-a-sovereign, may
help to produce. A long golden wand
is not necessary; but the least bit of
the coined metal. For only half-a-
sovereign, and a man may help to
change the horrible reality of Skye to
the fairy plenteousness of the Anti-
podes. Gentlemen, your subscriptions

Minutes of Difference
THERE can be no greater Minutes
of Difference, than the Minutes which
differ between the various public and
railway clocks in the metropolis. It
has been suggested, therefore, that
these clocks, since they are always
disagreeing, should go out and have a
meeting—attended, of course, with
their proper Seconds—in order that
their “Minutes of Difference” might
be settled in the same harmless way,
and with the same degree of “satis
faction,” as has attended another
meeting lately at Weybridge. The
only question is, if a clock could be
found' who would have the face to
make himself so ridiculous.

GRAND TOUR DE CONSCIENCE.
Eread a paragraph the other morn-
ing which spoke of a “hopeful
rumour” that a certain or un-
certain late Archdeacon, after
having gone over to the Church
of Rome, is expected to come
over again to the Church of
England. All this re-cantation
and cantation is not very credi-
table to the intellects of the parties
concerned, however much it may
say for their consciences. One
hardly knows the value to either
side of an individual whose posi-
tion is like that of a serious pen-
ulum, or of whom it may be
said, with respect
to his views on re-
ligious subjects,
“There he goes back-
wards and forwards,
There he goes round

bly some new preferment will be joyfully bestowed upon him. There
is, however, something inconsistent in the whole proceeding; and

may in the present instance—

“OUR CRITIC " AMong THE PICTURES.
A CRUISE ABOUT THE LINE.
UNPROFESSIONAL reader, do you know what the Line is at the
Academy Exhibition?
It is the front seat at the theatre; the corner-place, out of the
draught, in the railway carriage; the cross-table at the public dinner;
the grand stand at the Derby—in short, it is the best place on the
walls of the Royal Academy's Rooms, and is of course reserved, first,
for R.A.s and A.R.A.s, and, their wants satisfied, for those of the un:
lettered whom the Academy delighteth to honour.
The Line is that space of wall which an average man's eye embraces,
as he stands, without looking up or down. Painters are as anxious to
be hung “on the Line,” as convicts are to escape the same fate; and
in Trafalgar Square, as in the Old Bailey, gentlemen in this position are
jº. sure of attracting a crowd of admirers, or critics, as the case
may be.
Suppose we take a short cruise along this Exhibition Equator—
utting in here and there, as beauty tempts, or absurdity provokes, or
eebleness requires.
. Of course, pictures on the Line challenge criticism. There is no
timid bud. ‘...". opening genius here that one need fear to wither u
with a critical north-easter. Here are the strong men of canvas *
colour, quite able to defend themselves—or, if not, by what right are
they there?
The pictures in the Royal Academy Exhibition are hung by an
annual Committee of the Academicians. I don't know how this
º: are selected, or how set to work. With R.A.s
and A.R.A.s, I presume, they have no choice. But these disposed
pf, what guides them? One would be tempted, from two or three
indications observable here, to fancy that the magic of these letters
extends to wives, and sons, and cousins; may, failing academician kin—
like family fellowships at the Universities—to of academician's
name. . Beyond this, I cannot discover anything, to explain how some
of the Liners have found their way into this privileged place.
I wish to offer, you a humble hint, respectable R.A.s. Suppose for
once you broke through the rule of hanging all your own pictures on
the line? Suppose you directed your hanging committee to deal
upon the canvasses of their brethren as on those of the outer crowd?
I can easily conceive the embarrassment of such a task of selection.
The hang-men cannot be unknown, as they ought to be, and go about
their work like executioners of kings— with masks on. But what a
comfort it would be to see justice done for once Or, if that be impos-
sible this way, suppose for one year you were to choose your hanging
jury out of the unlettered of your brother painters? It appears to me
probable that the result would be more satisfactory to the public, and
more charitable to the Academy, than in the present mode. I should
certainly be spared the pain of explaining to my pretty country cousin
who will insist on knowing everything—how.R.A., No. 1, is supposed
to have gone crazy in his old age, but is still allowed to disport him-
self on these "... being harmless upon canvas; how R.A., No. 2,
once produced a good picture, and is therefore to be allowed to go on
thrusting bad ones under my nose to the end of his painting days; how
R.A., No. 3, paints execrable daubs for the Exhibition, it is true, but
then makes such wonderful sketches out of it; how R.A., No. 4, turns
out landscapes like feeble teaboards, but then in private is such a gen-
tlemanly person:—in short, I should be spared the necessity of ex-
plaining all the various reasons which account for the fatuous or feeble
works on the line with those magic letters in the catalogue, which tend
so to mislead my pretty cousin's judgment. Suppose she should get an
Art-Union prize:, how do. I know that she may not invest incontinent
in one of these misplaced liners ?
It is my proud privilege, whether in England or in my native Italy
to speak the truth. Even in Naples, where KING BoMBA has g ged
the press, stifled the cafés, and even muzzled the lazzaroni, he allows
PULCINELLO to talk at will in the Chioja, and to pass all in review, from
the sentence of PoERIo to the prospects of the Sardine fishery.
I am therefore privileged, I think, to utter those daring things about
the august Academy, although I know all I am risking... I suppose I
shall never be invited to the private view, or favoured with a ticket to
the dinner. I don't care; for between ourselves, not having a title
and not being a picture-buyer or a picture-dealer on a large scale, f
don't suppose they would ask me if I praised them all round, from WARD
to Jones. . So I may as well, say what I think, in spite of conse:
quences. I say, then, frankly, that there should be a privilege—I will
not call it a sentence—of superannuation for incapable R.A.s; or, if they
have such a vested right in the Academy walls, that they must be hung
there, let the Octagon room be set apart for a Chamber of Horrors, as
it were, to which may be consigned the works of the imbecile, the
incapable, and the impertinent amongst the Royal Academicians.
There would be no lack of tenants for that pleasant little dog-hole.
I can imagine what its walls would be this year, with my friend
Jones's Battle of Meeanee, in the place of honour, faced { MR.
SoLoMon. HART's Guttenberg, Faust, and, Schaffer, and flanked on
either side by the same gentleman's incredibly snobbish Reading for
Honours and Preparing for a Pluck. MR. HoLLINs's Deal Hocellers,
and Dieppe Grisettes, and Matelottes would probably take conspicuous
places—though it must be said that the painter is better employed on
such subjects, than on certain Romeos and Juliets I remember of his.
I am afraid that this year I should have to consign my excellent
and much-respected friend, MR. LESLIE, to the same limbo., What
right has a man like Mr. Leslie to paint me that abominable little
É. bread-and-butter miss, with a black dose, and to call the
lady Juliet, and the physic her sleeping-draught
I ask this with some warmth; for the more sincerely I admire and
respect MR. Leslie as a painter—the more distinct my recollection of
his exquisite Beatrice, running like a lapwing in the pleached walk,
with her arch eyes and sweet bright face—the more charming in my
memory the stately and winning grace of his Duchess, and the obese
shrewdness of his Sancho—the more º I have a right to be with that
unaccountable defiance of a British public which is involved in putting
such a title on such a picture. I have nothing to object to the young
woman or her occupation. If MR. Leslie choose to paint Miss SMITH
of Clapham Rise, as she appeared when about to take her medicine, he
is welcome to do so. But let him give the thing its right name, and
not mislead my pretty country cousin in this way, and compel me to
set her right, which is painful to me, as well as difficult, and often leads
to a little unpleasantness between us.
I am not at all sure that I should not consign MR. MACLISE's Alfred
to the cellar with MR. Leslie's Juliet. I protest I admire MR. MAC-
Lise's great power of draughtsmanship, his vigorous way of ping
a subject, and of mailing it down, in precise unmistakeable lines
upon his canvas. But what a collection of huge, writhen, de
limbs is here!—what an utter absence of harmonious colouring-
of artist-like distribution of light and shadow—of dramatic as well
as pictorial arrangement of groups-of genuine expression—of natural
texture! Look at those branches loaded with hawthorn bloom—
every petal made out, every leaflet drawn with pains, but the
whole cut in tin; not a flicker of living light—not a pin's point of
true imitation about a thing which, unless truly imitated, is nothing.
Observe that mass of fern in the right corner. Compare its leaden
ponds with the dewy dankness of MR. ANTHONY's fern brake, in that
round picture on your left. There is the true living reality; here is

has here done all that the Pre-Raffaelites have attempted.”. There must have been
a º in the types. No doubt what the eminent critic wrote, was “MR. MAcLise

on these accessories, if I could dwell with more satisfaction or award warmer

and I should be misleading the taste of my cousin, if I did not point out to her that
Alfred-instead of the calm, keen, quiet observation with which that model of prac.
tical wisdom must have scanned the Danish array, numbering its tents and noting
its weak points for attack—wears an expression of scowling second-hand, hare's-foot-
and-burnt-cork intensity, worthy only of MR. T. N. Hicks, as he appeared in the
“Grand, original, melodramatic, equestrian Spectacle of AirRED THE GREAT; or,
the WHITE HoRSE of THE SAxon, and the BLAck RAven of DENMARK,” at Astley’s.
And I have nothing better to say of those Danes, from their king downwards. In
fact, the picture is neither more nor less than an example of the tawdriest style of
third-rate theatrical grouping, and I do not see how I can say anything harsher.

THE EPSOM-GIPSY'S ART OF TELLING FORTUNES.
\
HE art is º simple. It de-
ends entirely upon the price.
helarger the pricethestronger
the fortune. For instance,
here is
A FORTUNE FOR SIXPENCE.
“Now my fine young gen-
tleman I see by the marks of
your hand that you are in love
and that your love is a black-
haired young lady but she has
already been married and has
got five children but loves you
more dearly than all the five
children and the moon and the
stars and the Great Bear and
the Little Bear all put together.
Now please you my fine young
gentleman I see an evil line in
your hand which tells me you
will destroy an old stocking of
your dear grandmamma's which
if you had looked into it before
you had thrown it into the fire
you would have found to con-
tain a sum of fiſty thousand
pounds all in new bank notes
from HER blessed MAJESTY's
blessed Mint which may the lucky stars always protect together, with PRINCE
ALBERT and all that belongs to her. Now sir may you always back the winning
horse sir and never cut yourself in shaving sir but marry the young lady, that is
dear to your heart and order the coachman to give the poor Gipsy something to
drink your honour's health.” Here, however, is something much better. It is a
FORTUNE FOR A shilling, AND A LEG OF A CHICKEN.
“My dear }.} young lady, I see by your sweet hand which is as full of kisses
as a baby's face that your heart will have more love than it will know how to hold
and a fine young gentleman will come and ask you for some of it and you will give
it him as kindly as you would that mice breast of a chicken if I were to ask you to
give it to me for the sake of the young bairn that is sick at home and wishes she
could only thank you for it like her poor mother which I am sure she does with all
her heart, and many blessings to you, my beautiful young lady for the same and a
gipsy's blessing always brings flowers to the cheek it falls upon and fortune will
smile upon ". my dear young lady like a young mother upon her new born child
and you will walk all your life through fields of hay and a carriage and four horses
to curry you home when you require change of air or you have forgotten to order your
dinner. And hearts my § will fall into your lap as surely as those scraps will, fall
into mine when your ladyship has done with them—and which will make a delicious
broth for the Gipsy and her poor bairn when they taste it with the remembrance of
your ladyship's kindness. The stars protect you my sweet lady—and may the
angel you're so like always smile down upon you from Heaven!”
Perhaps, however, it is wrong to pay the Gipsy before-hand. It is always best to
H. her afterwards, and then to let your generosity run in generous proportion to
ers'. . A penny for every thousand pounds—or a farthing for every child promised
—would be a handsome percentage which no Gipsy, considering the liberality with
which they distribute their tempting promises, would object to.
A glass of wine administered in advance, of course, has its effect upon the
magnitude of the fortune.
THE POETICAL COOKERY-BOOK.
arris rip.
Ana—“All that's bright must fails."
All new dishes fade—
The newest oft the fleetest;
Of all the pies now made,
The Apple's still the sweetest;
Cut and come again, -
The syrup upwards springing !
While my life and taste remain,
To thee my heart is clinging.
Other dainties fade—
The newest oft the fleetest;
But of all the pies now made,
The Apple's still the sweetest.
Who absurdly buys
Fruit not worth the baking?
Who wastes crust on pies
That do not pay for making P
Better far to be
An Apple Tartlet buying,
Than to make one at home, and see
On it there’s no .#
That must all be weigh’d,
When thyself thou treatest—
Still a pie home-made
Is, after all, the sweetest,
Who a pie would make,
First his apple slices;
Then he ought to take
Some cloves—the best of spices;
Grate some lemon rind,
Butter add discreetly;
Then some sugar mix—but mind
The pie's not made too sweetly.
Every pie that's made
With sugar, is completest;
But moderation should pervade—
Too sweet is not the sweetest.
Who would tone impart,
Must—if my word is trusted—
Add to his pie or tart
A glass of port—old crusted:
If a man of taste,
He, complete to make it,
In the very finest paste
Will enclose and bake it.
Pies have each their grade;
But, when this thou eatest,
Of all that e'er were made,
You'll say ’tis best and sweetest.
THE SPORTING PROPHETS.
TheRE never was a stronger illustration of the fact of
being “out for the day,” than that furnished by the sporting
rophets, who were one and all “out” for the Derby day.
he eyes of “ARGUs,” the prophet employed by the Post
seemed to have all missed the winning-post; “ Egasus.”
of Bell’s Life, seems to have used his wings for the wildest
flights of the imagination; and, as to “WATEs,” of the
Advertiser, he should, henceforth, adopt the poetical rather
than the prophetical version of his name; for it is clear he
is much weaker in matters of fact than in matters of
fiction. Agreement is generally a proof of correctness, and
the prophets may have the benefit of that one point in their
favour, for their unanimity in being all wrong is really
quite wonderful.
The Late “Affair" of Humbug.
We have been requested to state by the “Cock-pheasant”
supposed to have been present at the recent duel, that he
was not there at all, but that the bird actually in attendance
was an ordinary cock-sparrow, which the state of mind of the
rties magnified into the more important member of the
eathered tribe on the occasion in question. The scream sup-
posed to have been heard is now understood to have been
the echo of a bray from a maternal donkey calling home her
foal, as it is believed the parties had hit upon a very con-
siderable mare's nest,

What's to be Dome with the Serpentine P
The Serpentine is still confined to its bed with that unpleasant eruption of green spots
on its face and bosom, which have render d it such a disagreeable object in the eyes—and
noses—of the neighbourhood. The disgusting state of the patient may be conceived, from
the fact that it has not had its bed made for years, and that any attempt to improve the
condition of the bed has been met with a supply of wet blankets by those to whom the
case has been intrusted. Some hopes, have lately been raised—on the principle that one
disease sometimes alleviates another—by the development of a mild case of cataract in the
head of the unhappy River, under the form of the old Waterfall, which has recently been set
running. The only treatment we can recommend for the Serpentine is the total clearing
out of its bed, : we are sure the Government need have no difficulty on the subject,
since it has pumps enough in its employ for the purpose required.

THE POLITICAL CHAMELEON.
A FABLE FOR THE TIMEs.
'Tis oft the lot of Punch to mark
An empty sub-official spark,
With scarcely wit enough at most
To occupy the whipping-post.
Yet round the Lobbies he has been
To see what Members can be seen,
Returning from his servile tour,
Grown ten times perter than before.
Whate'er opinion you may drop,
The Whipper-in your mouth will stop.
“Sir, if my judgment you'll allow,
I ought officially to know.”
So asks you—free from all condition—
To pay to him a prompt submission.
Two country-men, of such a cast,
As the refreshment-room they pass'd,
And on their way, in empty chat,
Talk'd much of this, and more of that,
Touching on all things as they went,
Spoke of the present Government.
“A stranger compound,” cried the one,
“Never existed 'neath the sun :
A Tory body, hot and strong,
Protection's head, a Free Trade tongue;
Its teeth to bite its tongue inclined,
And then its tail—how far behind |
How slow its pace 1 and then its hue,
The regular Protection blue.”
“Hold there!” the other quick replies;
“Its Free Trade colours met my eyes,
As it with open mouthpiece lay
At Aylesbury the other day.
Taking it cool, the thing I view’d,
Eating its very words for food.”
“I’ve seen it, Sir, as well as you,
And say it takes Protection's hue.
At Ipswich I the creature saw,
The while it exercised its jaw.”
“Free Trade, FreeTrade, Sir, I assure you.’
“Free Trade 1" cries tºother, in a fury,
“Do you believe my wits I’ve lost?”
The friend replies, “’Twere no great cost;
For, if they serve you always thus,
They are not worth the smallest fuss.”
So high at last the contest rose
The Members nearly came to blows;
When, luckily, there came a third,
To whom the matter they referr'd,
And begg'd he'd tell them if they knew
Protection's shade from Free Trade’s hue.
“Sirs,” cried the umpire, “cease your bother
The Government's nor one nor t'other.
I saw the animal last night;
View'd it by House of Commons' light.
I mark’d it well—the truth to hint,
The body wears a neutral tint.
You stare' but I’ve a plan in view
To prove the fact.”—“Explain, Sir, do.”
“Well, then, at once to clear the doubt,
Suppose we turn the creature out,
On Opposition benches set him,
And if he's then Free Trade, I'll eat him.”
He spoke: then full before their sight
The §. appear’d—’twas white.
With no decided shade to rank,
It had become a perfect blank.
All stared and look'd extremely wise.
“My victims,” the Ex-Premier cries,
(For being out, he found his tongue)
“You all were right, and all were wrong.
When next you speak of placemen's hues,
Remember there are selfish views;
Nor wonder if 'tis sometimes shown,
A Government can sink its own.”

OUR CAMPAIGNS WITH WELLINGTON.
Hose who had rather that
the battle-field should be a
field for the imagination, in
which the mind may ramble,
while the body keeps out
of harm’s way, should go to
the Gallery of Illustration,
where they may take part
in all the exploits of F. M.
THE DUKE of WELLINGTON.
Having the honour to hold
a commission in the cele-
brated Punch corps, which
has served in so many good
actions during along literary
campaign, we placed our-
selves at the head of the
troops who are daily besieg-
ing the doors of the Gallery
in Regent-Street. Pushing
gallantly forward, we pro-
ceeded into the interior,
where we received a slight
check, but this only encou-
raged us to proceed, and we ultimately sat down, with a considerable
corps de réserve—which filled the reserved seats-for the purpose of
making observations. Finding our position a good one, we determined
to hold it in company with some “troops” of friends by, whom we
were surrounded, including a few infantry; and we formed a rather
considerable army of occupation, occupying the lines in front of the
scene of action. -
The first view that presented itself to us was Dangan Castle, in the
county of Meath, the birth-place of the DUKE, to whom we imme-
diately attached ourselves—though not quitting the mental reserves—
in the capacity of Aide-de-Camp. We were at once conveyed to Serin-
gapatam, under the directions of GENERAL HARBIs, and had the
satisfaction of sharing the retirement of the celebrated MRs. HARRIs
during the dangers of the siege, though we had the pleasure of wit
messing the striking picture of the removal of Tippoo to the tomb of
HYDER ALI. We continued to accompany the illustrious warrior
through his Indian campaigns, and had the honour of carrying the
colours—in our eye—at the battle of Assaye, where the standard of
perfection was gallantly maintained by CAPTAINS GRIFYE,TELBIN,
and ABsoLon. The horse were admirably managed and skilfully drawn
up by Hind-and-fore-Quarter-Master ALFRED Corbould, whose animal
spirits secured the admiration of all present. -
Leaving India, we proceeded to Europe, and were soon opposite
Lisbon, whose port—though neither dry nor full of body, for there is
plenty of water scarcely j, there—may be pronounced
excellent. We next had the satisfaction of being present at the taking
of Talavera, and at the still more interesting taking of a friendly, glass
of wine between the English and French during, a temporary truce,
when they met on the banks of a stream that divided them.
Still accompanying the renowned hero, we were present at the battle
of Busaco, and assisted, with our own hand, in letting off a round of
* which those who carried the colours into the battle elicited.
After a few other ºft scenes, in which we continued to act as an
army of observation, we found ourselves entering Madrid by the side
of WELLINGTON. Passing through numerous vicissitudes, we ultimately
formed part of a wing—the white feather, warranted to fly—at the
Battle of Waterloo. Our motions of this celebrated action having been
hitherto bounded by Stangate on the north, and the Westminster Road
on the west, were very much enlarged by the view that MR. GRIEVE
and his fellow-artists have taken—and given of it. The battle presents
one curious feature in the fact, that a BLUCHER trod very closely in the
shoes of a WELLINGTON.
This brings us to the close of WELLINGTON's Campaigns; and we
advise everybody—even those who, having been in them already, have
no objection to fight their battles harmlessly over again—to go and
take part in them as we have done. It is a pleasing º of the times,
and a mark of good taste on the part of the artists, that the pictures
are not chiefly “ of battles and sieges; ” but of “sites, local colour,
and costume,” which the proprietors say it has been their main purpose
to delineate.
The DUKE or WELLINGTON is a great man, no doubt, and the cir-
cumstances of the age in which he lived, caused his greatness to be
shown in war; but there is in these days little sympathy with “deeds
of battle,” and the artists have shown their true appreciation of public
taste by keeping war in the º as far as they could, even
while depicting the Campaigns of WELLINGTON.
The artists have acted wisely; for every incident in the Diorama,
showing the better side of human nature, meets with hearty applause;
while the one or two scenes of mere carnage—which are judiciously
rendered very rare—excite but secon interest. In conclusion,
much instruction and amusement may be derived from the contempla.
tion of the WELLINGTON Campaigns; and we advise everybody, to
enlist in the service—of the proprietors—immediately. It is said that
one volunteer is worth two pressed men; but, though we went as
men of the press, we were made very welcome, and excellent quarters
were assigned to us.

THE CRYSTAL PALACE IN THE CRYSTAL WILLAGE.
WHEN a new site was sought for the Crystal Palace, the Bishop or
LoNDon, asked only £100 a year rent per acre for certain of his lands;
a proof that Bishops know the value of this earth. The Bishop's offer
being declined, MR. Full ER looked elsewhere, and Sydenham
Sydenham is henceforth to be the Crystal Willage'
Of the future wonders of the Crystal Palace itself, we can scarcely
speak; but we have no doubt, whatever, that when the glorious fabric
is up, the western suburbs of London will, in so far as rents are con-
cerned, be well-nigh down. ..
The opposition to the continuance of the Palace in the Park origi-
nated and was organised by certain aristocratic bodies; and now, mark
the result! These folks are now so full of remorse for what they have
done—are, now so teasingly possessed by the belief that the Crystal
Palace will draw around it all the “rank and fashion” of London, that
ground-rents in the neighbourhood of Sydenham, or the Crystal Willage
—as it will henceforth be called-mount like quicksilver. Among ºf:
earliest visitors has been LORD CAMPBELL, who, it is said—for we do
not pledge ourselves to the fact—has offered any money for a site, as
near as possible to the Palace, for a new mansion, JUDGE CREsswell
has also been seen in the neighbourhood. A large plot of land was
about to be sold, when it was discovered that the purchaser was an
agent of LoRD SEYMoUR's; whereupon the public-spirited individual
the owner, declared, off; consenting only to part with so much as—i
his Lordship were desirous of becoming a tenant upon any terms—
would allow him to sink a pump.
. The migration from the west-end towards the Crystal Village will, it
is expected, be so great, that Tottenham-court Road will be able to
move to Kensington; Spitalfields or Shoreditch dropping to Tottenham-
court Road. º an enthusiastic licensed victualler has given
notice of application for a tavern, to be called The Sibthorp's Head; it
must be owned, rather an ominous sign for a landlord ºft. would not
have an empty house.

Vestry of the Parish of St. Rump-cum-Dozen, Bishopsgate Street

THE ARABS IN PARIS.
CERTAIN Arab Chiefs—quite a sample of their race—have had their
education finished in Paris. They return to the desert shining with
French polish. Galignani-always brimful of French sentiment accord-
ing to the demand of the market—relates how, before the departure of
the Chiefs, they visited the widow of MARSHAL Bugeaud, to express
their admiration of the General who had destroyed thousands of their
countrymen; and to sympathise with the widow on the cause of her
forlornness. The Kalifa of Constantine said:—
“The good which the Marshal has done is immense; he has sown it in our country
as a labourer sows barley in the furrows, for his name is written not only in our
hearts, but his works are engraven in indelible characters on our mountains and in =
our plains.”
Once upon a time a man sowed gunpowder, mistaking it for onion-
seed; the Marshal's premeditated sowing must have been of this sort;
although Arab gratitude has taken the sulphur and saltpetre for barley.
The Marshal's works, moreover, are no doubt engraven deeply as sword
and fire could cut and scathe them.
acknowledgment of the Marshal's good works was expressed, and the
conversation became general, many beautiful stories were related for
the delight and comfort of the bereaved widow.
“Another related the combat of the Sikaſ, and the moment when GENERAL Mus-
TAPHA Bou Is:IAEL, when wounded in the hand with a musket-ball, deposited at the
feet of the conqueror three heads which he had himself cut off."
What a pity that the heads themselves were not forthcoming ! . The
sentiment that still embalmed them for the consideration of the
Marshal's widow would then have been complete. The Marshal visited
the prisoners in the rude campaign of 1846–47, when
“As fatigue and privation had dried up the milk of several of the women, the Duke
D'Isly had provided them with goats for the nourishment of their children.”
The husbands of the women had their throats cut—but the fatherless
babes were “provided, with goats | " . Hereupon, MAnAME BUGEAUD
. when another chief having comforted her, there was a general
cuorus :
“And now, thanks be to God for having procured us the satisfaction of seeing the
son and the widow of him who fills our hearts and our mouths."
The mouths filled by the Marshal in Algeria are, doubtless, not to be
tººl: mouths filled, too, with their country—(i. e., their country’s
clay).
Galignani does not tell us whether the entertainment at the house of
the widow concluded with fireworks; but—in Lonour of the memory
of the Marshal—they ought. A lively representation of the caves of
Dahra, with a portrait of PELISSIER, would have made a transparency
—though nothing, by possibility, more transparent than the atrocious
. that sent the Arabs to fawn upon the widow of a tyrant and
uuciler.
THE CAUCASIAN BROTHERS.
The extraordinary sympathy of the Corsican Brothers—so beautifully
developed by KEAN at the Princess's and Buckston E at the Hay-
market—has asserted its mysterious power in the real bosoms of real
life. The Right HoN. BENJAMIN DisrAELI and the ejected DAVID
SALoMons—of the Caucasian race–Caucasian Brothers, have in a
narvellous manner felt the influence of fraternal sympathy. The drama
of the stage—got up with all possible effects—is nothing to the drama
of politics. A few recorded instances may serve to show the stu-
pendous truth of this discovery.
David SALoMons is fined for
sitting and voting in the House of
Commons.
BENJAMIN DISRAELI is snubbed
for Free Trade admissions by
DERby.
However, when the formal
David again addresses the elec-
tors of Greenwich.
DAviD is dropped by LoRD John
RussiLL.
DAVID, desponding, doubts
whether next Session he shall sit
in Parliament.
DAviD determines to have a suit
of small-coal and sackcloth.
DAVID resolves—come what may,
next Session—to sit upon the steps
of the House of Commons.
DAVID will again ask of BENJA-
MIN, “Are you not a man and a
brother ?”
BENJAMIN again returns to Pro-
tection.
BENJAMIN, meeting him at the
QUEEN's Ball, shakes his Lordship
by the hand.
BENJAMIN, in high spirits, de-
termines to lead the House.
BENJAMIN orders of his tailor a
bran-new Windsor uniform.
BENJAMIN-come what may—
upon the Treasury Bench.
BENJAMIN will move the pre-
vious question.
To CoreRESPONDENTS.
THE original Do-the-Boys Hall was in Yorkshire.
There is an
establishment of the same name in the neighbourhood of Westminster
Abbey. For further particulars apply to the Dean and Chapter of that
collegiate Church.
THE DUCKS OF THE CHURCH.
WE know how MRs. Bourne invited-
in her blandest way—her dear little
ducks to come and be killed. And,
doubtless, it was the politeness of the
landlady that always deprived the cere-
mony of killing of its usual
inconvenience. Now, LoRD
BLANDFord would sacrifice
his Ducks of the Church in
the rudest and least cere-
monious manner, without
any consent soever asked or
given. His Lordship has, in
the most summary way, in-
troduced a Bill “to make
better provision for the ma-
nagement and distribution
of episcopal and capitulaf
revenues.” Whereat certain
Members of the Bristol Church Union—clerical and lay—are much
scandalised and astonished; protesting that no such Bill should
become an Act, “without the previous deliberation and concurrence or
the Church of England!” Such consent—even as the consent of the
landlady's ducks to be killed—would no doubt be cheerfully obtained,
if properly solicited. We would, then, advise LoRD BLANDF9RD, to
try the persuasive tones of his voice; and before proceeding further
with his Bill, to take his way to Fulham, and at the doors of the palace
to cry, through a silver speaking trumpet—“Bishop, Bishop, Bishop,
come and be plucked l’” We have no doubt whatever of the answer.
THE ORACLE OF DERBY.
WHAT hope, what fear, attend on DERBY's breath!
The other day he sigh’d Protection's death; .
Last night his Lordship sang a different strain,
And threatened to restore the tax on grain.
The landlord now his honeyed words content,
With promise of a scheme to screw up rent,
Excite in acred squires a merry mood,
And make the people tremble for their food.
Now bodes his language to the rural pack,
Free Trade and Corn Laws never to come back;
With blank dismay appals the rustic oaves,
And bids us all expect perennial loaves.
Maynooth anon my Lord to menace seems,
And flatter Spooner's mind with pleasing dreams;
The sweet musicians then with hope he feeds,
The tuneful band of brass that KEogh leads;
In short, to speak the speech of common use,
The noble Earl keeps talking fast and loose;
Pearls black and white in his discourse are strung,
And my LoRD DERBY has a double tongue.
Sale of the Soult Gallery.
THE spoils of SouLT's Spanish campaign have been sold within the
past few days, in Paris. The papers speak of the crowds that beset the
place. At a certain time came the PRESIDENT to have a look at the works;
when the sergens-de-ville, much to the disgust of the Parisians, entered
and cleared a way for the ruler of France.
highly delighted with many of the paintings! . Now as they were nearly
all of them originally stolen, we wonder whether the admiration of the
PRESIDENT was raised more by the works themselves than by the means
by which they were obtained Any way, it was a proper tribute to the
memory of the plunderer of Spain that his Hº: should be duly
considered by the burglar of France.
Louis NAPOLeoN was
“Prophetic" Emigration.
WE should recommend “ARGUs,” and “WAtes,” and “PRIAM,”
and “Touchstone,” and “Pegasus,” and the whole tribe of sporting
Seers and Soothsayers to emigrate as fast as they can, for it has been
most clearly proved by their late Derby failure that they are “no
Prophets in their own country.”
An EVIL OF THEIR OWN ELECTION.

franchised, they have been going about declaring they are the

RAPID GROWTH IN ENGLAND.
It is very curious how rapidly one grows in England sometimes.
This has been the case more particularly lately. e have known
young persons grow suddenly four, five, and six years older within the
present twelvemonth. Many elderly young men about town, who, not
more than six months ago, were scarcely thirty-two years of age, now
confess to their being “six and thirty, if they’re a day.” We are at
a loss to know what particular cause to attribute this rapid growth to,
unless perchance it is the fear of the Militia Bill already beginning to
operate. This is not unlikely, for it is already º, known that
that bellicose measure exempts from service “all persons after the age
of thirty-five.” It is the fear of being º to wear an odious,
vulgar uniform, and the bore of having to do duty every year for twenty-
one days, that has caused so many of our antiquated beaux, who, only
last season, were so astonishingly young, to make such a tremendous
}. forward in the calculation of their ages. It is lucky that the
adies, the elderly belles, who become younger the older they grow,
have no female Militia Bill to act upon tº: fears in a similar way.
Eagles at Feeding Time.
Royal, eagles can, on occasion, feed together pacifically as doves;
witness the banquet lately held at the Royal Palace, Berlin, when the
Eagle of Russia and the Eagle of Prussia pecked a bit together. The
Prussian Eagle rose and shook himself, and gave the health of the
Eagle of Russia, saying:-
“God preserve him to that portion of his world which he has given him for an
inheritance, and to our epoch, to which he is indispensable!"
"Let Newton be, and all was light,” says the poet: let Nicholas have
Russia, Poland, &c, &c., for his double beak, -and let us possess him
to our epoch, for which his gunpowder is indispensable.
Colour for an American's Remark.
The American Minister, dining with the Fishmongers, is reported
to have said, “This corporation has the honour of numbering among
its members the man who slew WAT TYLER.” It seems strange that
an American should have sympathised against, instead of with, the
patriotic blacksmith; but perhaps that anomaly may be explained by
the supposition that he did not reflect that a black smith is not neces-
sarily a nigger.
A Letter FRESH FROM THE COWER.

as a Bird who only frequents the tables of the Rich, that he merely was

Poor old MADAME SAquil How many of us can look a long, long
way—we will not think how long—back, when that marvellous woman
stood, the centre, the human speck, of a burning Vauxhall-star—who
shall say, how many feet above the earth?, MADAME SAquil. Mar-
wellous, indeed, were the wonders of Vauxhall! The millions of lights
that made dim the very story-books, and gave to childhood an actual
knowledge, a breathing experience of glories and effulgencies, that made
even SINBAD poor and colourless. The Arabian Nights! Čould they
be anything like that night—our first night—in Vauxhall Gardens; a
night whose wonders were crowned by that astounding Frenchwoman

and rained * by golden showers; showers that seemed a real, en-

Well, with a heavier load of years upon her shoulders, the devoted
sister had her shoes chalked once more, and once more mounted the
rope; balancing and dancing away; but somehow not dancing fortune
back to her. However, she managed to save some 30,000f. in Spain;

May it not be equally possible to behold self-sacrifice even upon a

PUNCH'S CRUELTY TO QUOTATIONS BILL.
MR. Punch has observed, with extreme regret,
that in spite of his humane exertions, ;
Timeo Danaos and Rusticus expectat have been
publicly maltreated in the House of Commons.
Once more he has, therefore, to beg the assist-
ance of his kind friends in aid of his bill for
the suppression of these enormities.
Besides the list of unhappy Quotations—
poor refugees from the Latin authors, which
Mr. Punch claimed protection for, when he last
addressed the House on this matter—there
are a few more which claim the same con-
sideration:-E. g.
Why cannot the probable punishment of a
nefarious minister be hinted at without our
venerable friend, Raro antecedentem scelestum
being dragged in If the British nation be
degenerated, say so

guished in the mechanical arts in England, but why should poor
Freudent alii, &c., pay the penalty of it *
Nobody can doubt that life has its share of annoyances, but why add
to the share of poor dear Surgit amari aliquid? - -
Then, Blogsity is elegant and speculative (particularly at his own
excellent dinners); but Punch doesn't see why Ertraflammantia maenia
mundi should be cudgelled into doing public homage to his faculties!
And if the NAPIERs are brave and †. warriors, Punch, for one,
would scorn to panegyrise them at the miserable expense of poor Duo
fulmina belli. -
Really, gentlemen, cannot you make up your minds to allude to the
vagaries of Bloomers without making Parium et mutabile semper Femina

THE ELECTIONEERING LETTER-WRITER.
THERE is great room
for improvement in
the addresses which
candidates for seats
s in Parliament are
º, now writing to their
1 constituents.
Most of these com-
positions are couched
in a coaxing tone,
which is very mean,
and express a defer-
ence and a respect
tº which are manifestly
3- affected. A free and
independent elector,
if he has the senti-
ments of an English-
man, must feel in-
sulted by an attempt
to wheedle and flatter him out of his vote. He must know that no
entleman would, in so abject a manner, solicit the honour of cleaning
; boots. Yet the man who represents you in the House of Commons
—your Parliamentary servant—must work harder than your footman,
if not do work as dirty. He can have no legitimate motive to seek
such an office, but a sense of duty; and that would induce him to apply
for it in the style of one who feels that he is offering to confer a favour
—not asking for one. As thus, for example—
“To the Electors of Mudford.
“GENTLEMEN,
“Having no business of my own to attend to, I am willing
to undertake yours; and if you choose to return me as one of your
Members of Parliament, I will accept the employment. I make this
announcement to you at the instance of some friends of mine, who
represent to me that I have leisure which I ought to devote to the
good of my fellow-men, and that my qualifications would best enable
me to serve them in the capacity of legislator. -
“The labour of a conscientious Member of Parliament is very
burdensome. It takes a great deal of trouble to get up the facts and
figures which he must master in order to understand the political
questions that come before him—more particularly if he is to take part
in their discussion. He has to sit up late at nights in an unwholesome
atmosphere, listening to all manner of rigmarole and empty prolixity:
and besides, he is liable to serve on Committees, which is a monstrous
bore. For all this he is rewarded, in a great measure, with obloquy,
abuse, and ridicule.
-- However, these tasks must be performed by some persons; and
doubtless the individuals on whom they *rī, devolve, are those
who, like myself, have more money and time than they can spend,
reasonably, on their own affairs.
“My abilities to discharge the duties which I will allow you to
impose upon me, consist in a strong sense of justice, a clear under-
standing, a considerable amount of acquired knowledge, on most
subjects, especially those of history and law, and a facility in the logical
and perspicuous expression of my ideas.
“Should you think proper to return me, I shall feel bound to acquit
myself of my obligations to you, and the nation at large, as well as I
wº Can. -
“I do not see why I should urge you to accept my proposition, but
should it appear eligible to you, I can only say that you are at liberty
to take the necessary steps for insuring my election, with the distinct
understanding, that my return must be free of expense, as I consider
that in dedicating to you my time and services, I am making as great
a sacrifice as can be expected of me.
“At your command, then, Gentlemen, I remain,
“Your obedient servant,
“Reform Club, June, 1852. “ARISTIDEs BROWN.”
"P.S. W. ºl. views are based on the principles of truth and
equity, in which you must confide, if you mean me to be your repre-
sentative: for I cannot give pledges as to particular measures, with
respect to which my conduct might be determined by circumstances.”
Such as the above would be the address of the candidate who only
contemplated the good of the electors. If he had merely in view his
own advantage, or the simple gratification of his personal vanity and
ambition, he would take another tone—the usual one.
Even a Tory might as well be open and straightforward. Instead of
describing himself, in the style of a puffing tailor, as coming forward,
“on the Conservative interest, to uphold those time-honoured prin.
ciples on which our glorious Constitution,” &c.; it would he much
more dignified, as well as judicious, to write plainly and confidently in
this way:-
“To the Voters of Fenborough.
“GENTLEMEN AND OTHERs,
“I present myself as candidate to represent your borough in
the House of Commons.
“I have the honour of being recommended to you by the eminent
nobleman who owns so much property among you; and on whose
patronage so many of you chiefly subsist... .
“My politics are the same as that, distinguished nobleman's. They
are also identical with those of the higher clergy, and officers of the
army and navy residing among you, and dealing so largely with the
tradesmen and professional people in your neighbourhood.
“For most of you this intimation will suffice; but probably there
are, amongst you some free and independent men to whom I may as
well state my political principles more explicitly. -
“I am, then, an old Tory. I am opposed to popular enlightenment,
education, progress, and civil and religious liberty. -
“I think knowledge had better be confined to our old Universities
of Oxford and Cambridge, and that instead of going on, we should go
back, if we mean to save the country.
ºft is my belief that our policy, for upwards of twenty years, has
been a great mistake. I am prepared to vote for the re-enactment of
the Test and Corporation Acts; for the repeal of the Roman Catholic
Emancipation Bill; and for returning to the system of Parliamentary
representation which was changed by the Reform Bill, so called. Should
no statesman have the moral courage to propose the reversal of these
mischievous measures, I will at least do my best to frustrate them, and
render them inoperative.
“I advocate the restitution of slavery, in the Colonies. I would
restore the wholesome severity of the penal code. It is my conviction
that all rogues ought to be hanged, and, I think the country suffers
seriously from their not being so, besides having to maintain such
ſº." an existence, of which they should, by rights, have been
eprived.
‘The system of impressment is one which I would strongly maintain,
It not on }. recruited our navy; but it gave county magistrates and
other gentlemen opportunities for getting rid of troublesome fellows.
“I would support the full revival of flogging in the army.
“I would put limits to the use of machinery and the operations of
trade, in order to depress the manufacturer to his proper level, beneath
the agriculturist, so as to give a due predominance to the landed
interest, which I esteem as Class No. 1.
“I consider the incomes of Bishops sacred, and would suffer no
alteration in the distribution of Church property.
“All innovations in Chancery, or in any department of the law, under
the name of reforms, I would resist, as injurious to the vested interests
of the legal profession.
“I will concur in any proposition to double our land and sea forces.
I would render the Game-laws more stringent.
“I would retain sinecures, as affording decent provision for gen-
tlemen of narrow means and good families.
“I am opposed to Free Trade, and an advocate of Monopoly, and
the privileges of the Few as ". to the claims of the #.
There will be plenty of strong beer at the Hog-in-Armour, where I
have fixed my quarters.
“I have the honour to be, &c.

TO GENTLEMEN IN DIFFICULTIES.
PLANTAGENET Bootle owes—let us say—ten thousand pounds!
For a Bootle, a milk-score; yea, an ass's milk-score.
Mr. Punch offers himself as a person peculiarly fitted to relieve
the embarrassed. Mr. Punch—taking BootLE as an example—will
benevolently, for no fee whatever, reveal his pecuniary plan.
Bootle has no money, but BootLE has an estate—somewhere. A
very fine estate; and the rents are—occasionally—very regularly paid.
Now, with these worldly advantages, why, in the name of California,
should Bootie be dunned, bothered for a dirty ten thousand pounds?
BootLE has—we will take a round number—a hundred creditors.
He owes to each (round numbers again) a hundred pounds.
.The hundred creditors are called together. Punch talks to them in
his own bland way, and they, one and all, with six per cent. interest,
take Bootle's bills at three months for—£100
The three months are gone in about three weeks; months always
flying with quadruple velocity, when their wings carry stamps. Bootle
has not a farthing. where with to meet the bills: it is very annoying,
but PLANTAGENET is penniless.
Mr. Punch calls the creditors, together: they are very noisy—of
course; very indignant; Bootle's voted a scoundrel; and Mr. Punch,
closing his palms together and drooping his eye-lids, resignedly bows.
Mr. Punch, suggests, an arrangement by which the bills may be
“extinguished.” It is this-Bootle will renew every hundred pound bill
for seventy-five pounds; by which process twenty-five pounds will be
extinguished, to the benefit of B9QTLE.
There is a great row; but the bills are renewed for the seventy-five
pounds—renewed and again dishonoured.
Bootle is execrated everywhere as a swindler, but Punch again calls
the creditors together; and, º, the hurricane of their wrath,
finally induces them to take for their bills of seventy-five pounds, bills
for fifty pounds; by which process, another five-and-twenty pounds of
the original hundred are, to the profit of Bootle, extin §§
And now the reader laughs contemptuously at Punch, and tells, him
to his teeth that he is a conceited nincompoop, to think that, with all
his eloquence and all his gammon—for that is the coarse word—he can
ever hope so to gull a body of honest people out of their money.
Well, Punch confesses it—he did butjest. Nevertheless, what he has
not the audacity to propose, Spain and Portugal—with serenest impu-
dence—offer to the ". ish bondholder.
“To extinguish” a debt, as defined by Spain and Portugal, is not for
the debtor to put the debt out at once, but by, degree; and that by
paying no part of it. Not by the extinguisher, but snuffers, thus:-
he snuffers at one snip take off one-fourth of the wick; then the
other fourth; again; and the last “extinguishes,”, the obligation!, .
Thus Spain and Portugal have extinguished their debt, and their
creditors are left in the dark as to the pecuniary remedy. The debt is
not to be blown in again.
A NEW DERBY CUP.
It is proposed to the territorial aristocracy to, subscribe for a
testimonial to the EARL of DERBY, to consist of a golden lacrymatory,
the metal whereof is to be derived from rent, which it is expected that
the hopes inspired by the noble Earl's Government will uphold, until
the progress of agriculture shall have reinstated the farmers in the
prosperity which once enabled them to º easily. This honorary,
though lugubrious utensil, is to be given to Loºp DERBY, in order that
he may weep into it in utter despair of re-enacting, a corn-law, and so
preserve the results of his crying, to present them to the agriculturist,
is evidences of that will which the generous mind always takes,for the
deed. Thus posterity, slightly varying a famous elegy, will inscribe upon
the PREMIER's monument:-
“He gave the Farmer all he had—a tear."
and may—or may not—add,
“And made John Bull—'twas all he wished—his friend."
An ‘º Honour"-able Distinction.
AFTER a harmless interchange of shots, the Weybridge duellists are
reported to have declared themselves."perſectly satisfied. In the
name of common wonder, “satisfied” with what? – With having
achieved a doubtful notoriety, and for a day or two afforded food for
the gossips, and grateful penny-a-liners? Well, every one to his taste,
certainly; but for ourselves, we must confess we are by, no means
envious of that distinction which is usually coupled with a “difference.”
POLITICAL HOAX.
A youthFUL Cockney, fresh—very fresh-from Epsom, remarked
that the present Administration was such an imposition that he thought
it had better be called the Oaks than the Derby.

A LUNATIC IN CHANCERY.
HE Papers contained the other day
an account of some proceedings in
Chancery, which were significantly
headed in re BLANK, a Lunatic.
Any one who reads the report, will
not be surprised at the lunacy of
BLANK, whose “West Indian
Estates have been kept up at an
annual loss of £2500,” and who
was “represented,” on the occa-
sion to which the report, refers, by
no less than nine counsel. Surely,
this is enough to drive any one
mad; and we are quite sure that
the Chancery Lunatic would form
quite as effective a hero of a de-
scriptive song as the Maniac. The
first stanzas might consist of his
declarations of sanity, with the well-known refrain of “I am not mad
-I am not mad!”, until the progress of the Chancery suit, as detailed
In º:sºng, should lead up to the terrible climax, “They’ve driven
me mad.”
We feel thoroughly convinced that a º: exciting and terribly
instructive entertainment might be got up on the subject of the Court
of Chancery, as a sort of opposition to the Holy Land, and the title of
the Accursed Districts might be bestowed upon it.
Everybody is flocking to see the ascent of Mont Blanc, and every:
body would also hasten to witness a similarly . view and
description of the still more dangerous descent into the abyss of Equity.
An awful account might be given of the perilous passage over the
fearful crevasse of the Rolls, and the frightful scaling of that slippery
ºur de cotº—where you pay, so dearly for every step you take—the
Masters' offices. How many fatal spots might be pointed out in such
a picture as this: and there is no doubt that the exact point at which
some unfortunate “JARNDyce " was overwhelmed by an avalanche of
costs might be accurately indicated. The barristers would of course
be introduced as guides, and a terrible tableau of a Chancery Morgue
would add to the dreadful reality of the description. Our own Toby
would have much pleasure in sitting or standing for one of the cele.
brated dogs, whose province it is to rescue the unfortunate victims
who have become imbedded in the eternal snows of Equity, which,
though never given to the melting mood themselves, have the effect of
melting all that they come in contact with.
THE PATRON OF BETTING OFFICES.
THERE is, nearly opposite HATCHETT's, in Piccadilly, a certain esta-
blishment, on the door of which is inscribed, in conspicuously large
characters, St. JAMEs's BETTING OFFICE | Now, were the name
simply JAMEs's, or rather JEMEs's, it would be unobjectionable. But
although it is conceivable that Saint JAMEs should rejoice in the guar-
dianship of a street or a palace, it is not easy to imagine him willing to
accºpt the patronage of a Betting Office. A gambling house is not the
sort of concern which any saint could be disposed to take under, his
protection: a species of being at the antipodes of the saints would be
the more appropriate patron of a den of which the most suitable, if not
proper, name, is that of a place which shall here be nameless. It is
able that the proprietors of the Betting Office in Piccadilly never
eard of St. JAMEs, or at least do not know who he was, or anything
about him: which in some measure may excuse the mistake they have
committed in making use of his name to dignify a sort of institution to
which he would never have lent it. They had better remove JAMEs
from their door, and put HARRY in its place, substituting, for the
qualification of saintship, that of antiquity.
A Case for Counsel.
A case of some difficulty has just been submitted to MR. BRIEFLess,
who is at present engaged in looking, up the authorities on the some.
what novel question, whether an old cravat found lying without an

Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt, for the general

with it little or no interest. It seems to have been originally an in-
vestment in the three and a half, for three and six is about the figure

POTATO POTEEN.
THERE is an Industrial Exhibition now going on in Prussia, where
one of the most interesting productions is a quantity of whiskey made
from potatoes. . There is nothing very cheerful or inebriating in the
notion of a potato, but it seems that it is possible to get drunk upon
that very common-place and every-day esculent. The idea of indulging
in potato potations is somewhat, novel, but it appears that a man may
positively make merry on the º: of a pound of champions. Animal
spirits are common enough; but vegetable spirits, as distinguished from
animal spirits, we have no recollection of meeting with. e shall, we
suppose, be having festive songs on the subject of vegetables, as we have
hitherto had upon the vine, and we should not be astonished to hear at
convivial meetings such lays as the following:—
A §. of potatoes come peel, peel for me,
ive those who prefer it pure gin;
No matter what sort, so potatoes they be,
Divested with care of their skin.
For oh, when the cares of the day are gone by,
And a man is disposed to grow frisky,

i MODERN MYTHOLOGY.
Mong the ancients,
countries, cities
and towns were
represented by tu-
telar deities, gene-
rally of the femi-
nine gender. The
representation of
England is rather
anomalous. Eng-
land has but one
female represen-
tative – BRITAN-
NIA, who appears,
armed with an
eel-spear and a
pot-lid, on the re-
verse side of
pence and half-
pence, where, she
is vernacularly
called Tails; also
in the front of
various insurance
offices, joint-stock
banks, and ma-
rine store shops.
Strong - minded
women assert that
England ought to have a greater number of female representatives.
BritANNIA, till the time of recent Admiralties, was supposed to rule the
waves. England is also represented by a gentleman of ample propor-
tions, who is delineated in top-boots, buckskin breeches, and a capacious
waistcoat, bearing a cudgel, and is called JoHN BUL. The figure, of
join Buil, occurs generally in an attitude of astonishment and indig-
nation, expressive of his views of the conduct of Ministers. It is
commonly considered that John Bull does not enjoy his due share
in the representation. The other representatives of England are
numerous, and form a certain assembly, which, if it were properly con;
stituted, would consist of heroes and sages. These personages all
represent counties, boroughs, or universities, nominally; but in reality
a great many of them merely represent noblemen and landlords; whilst
Ireland is ostensibly represented by a set of puppets, the greater part
of whom, in fact, represent the Pope of Rome.
ºf-
MAN C H E STER, &
BuckINGHAMsHIRE is chiefly represented by a somewhat spare and
pale º: with hair curling so strongly, that, at an earlier age, it
might have procured for its wearer the appellation of “the curly-headed
º had his principles then been the same as they are now, an
ad his features not º more pronounced than we usually find those
of the Saxon rustic. He sometimes º as a plain gentleman in
black; at others, as masquerading, in the garb of a country squire,
He at present presides over the Exchequer.
Lincoln is represented for the most part in the shape of a
wild-looking gentleman, with moustaches and an eyeglass, whose
capacity may be concisely described as military. His air is grave; but
he is not so profound as he looks, and he makes jokes, which excite
great laughter, but not so much as he occasions when he attempts to
speak seriously. He is often seen in the act of making his exit, with
his papers in his pocket, from the House of Commons previously to a
division, because he dislikes the Opposition, and has no confidence in
Government.
LoNDoN has no less than four representatives—the most remarkable
of whom wears the aspect of a Noble Lord, and did wear also the
Windsor uniform, but is now depicted as a page out of livery. Three
of the group are seated; the fourth is apparently trying to take his
seat, but prevented from sitting by a personification of Religious
Liberty, in a coronet.
MANCHESTER, is principally represented º a man having a broad.
brimmed hat and buttonless coat, with a straight collar, taking his stand
upon a sack of foreign corn, and making a violent effort to spike a cannon.
The best known º of Oxford may be described as
exhibiting the form and features of a respectable elderly gentleman,
wearing an old lady’s apron, and extending a classical but rusty agis
ºned with a mitred Gorgon's head, over a heap of loaves an
Siles.
ABILITY AND INCLINATION.
To the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER.
“I am here, Sir, to put in practice, as far as I am able, the policy I advocated when
on the other side of the House.”—MR. Disbaeli, on his legs. .
Your principles—should your position prove stable-
You’ll push, you inform us, “as far as you’re able.”
Now, BENJAMIN, what we're desirous to know,
Is, what lengths, if you’re able, you purpose to go.
Let the voice of the Bucks agriculturists' charmer
Say how far he’ll proceed, to please landlord and farmer.
Declare to what size you the loaf would reduce,
As to let you supposing John BULL such a goose.
Will you go the whole Hog, with its gluttonous brood,
That once gorged its fill on the multitude's food?
Is there any restriction you’d place on the feast
By a sliding scale think you to limit the beast?
Because, of your views if the least doubt exists,
With regard to our quarterns, and busters, and twists,
The people themselves must the benefit give
Of that doubt as to how you intend them to live;
And make sure you won't subject their food to taxation,
By ousting yourself and your Administration.
A SUSPICIOUS SHOWER.
THE Kilkenny Moderator states, we find, that a shower of rain has
lately fallen in that vicinity, which–
* Proved upon examination, to have been of an almost inky blackness.”
Now this is rather early, we think, for this meteorological phenome-
non. We usually do not hear of it until the Autumn, when the absence
of political news obliges our contemporaries to resort elsewhere to fill
their columns. Showers of black rain fall copiously, then, we know,
and serve to irrigate the “gigantic gooseberries” with which we are
annually surfeited. It seems to us, therefore, that the epithet “inky,”
in the boºnstance is chosen with really a most refreshing naiveté,
seeing that the showr, in question would doubtless “prove upon
examination,” to have fallen merely from the pen of a penny-a-liner.
A Foolish Proposition not so Foolish as it Looks.
In the Isle of Skye there is poverty and starvation—in other words,
the island yields nothing which affords the slightest employment for the
teeth. In Australia, the fields are overrunning literally with gold-in
other words, there is plenty of food and employment to fill the mouths
of all. Why not send the inhabitants of the starving country to par-
ticipate in the harvest of the golden one? Be not ashamed to try a
dentist's remedy for once. Treat the inhabitants of Skye as if they
were suffering from the toothache—and by sending them to Australis,
give them the greatest relief by “stopping their mouths with gold.”
A FARE INFERENCE.
A CABMAN must either be the most grasping, or the most extrava-
gant of men. We are inclined to the latter, belief; for we have
always found when he drove us anywhere, that it was as much as he
could do to make a Shilling go as far as eightpence ought to do.
A Rop Is A PRETTY Pickle.—BIRCH, the Irish libeller, who has
just been sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment.

THE CANTERBURY EAGLE'S NEST.
OCIETY dignifies an
archbishop with the
title of Most Reverend
Father. There is good
reason, however, for sty-
ling archbishops. Most
Affectionate Fathers
also. If any one knows
what it is to have a
dear, kind papa, the son
of an archiepiscopal sire
is that blessed child.
These pleasing reflec-
tions are suggested by
certain passages in a
letter addressed by SIR
BENJAMIN HALL to a
morning contemporary,
illustrative of the al-
most incredible good-
mess of certain primates
of all England to their
children. Among our
glorious, institutions,
there is the Prerogative
Court of Canterbury,
where, writes SIR BEN-
JAMIN, on the authority
of a Blue Book:–
“The son of an arch-
bishop, being rector of
two parishes, situated in
different counties and a
prebend of Canterbury,
tº is also the registrar of
: the court,from which si-
necure office (for he does
not perform the duties),
Sºś W
º, ºrs -
AAA 1 ° -

ſiſ Šſ: % / ſ aſ " . -
F. W. § t | #| A "ſt ſº . 'he receives £10,894 per
zºº. 2 ºr ºs- annum, besides p088es-
sing patronage of other
sinecure offices in the same court with more than £20,000 a year! The patent.ºy which
this reverend pluralist and sinecure registrar is appointed, commences with these
words:—“To all the faithful in Christ unto whom these presents shall come, &c., and
is signed by the archbishop. Wide page 116 of the Report.
*At the death of the present registrar, the vacancy will be filled up by the grandson
of another archbishop, who was appointed to the reversion when he was sixteen Yeºr:
of age. He is now a peer of the realm, and was lately an officer in the Life Guards!
At his death the son of another archbishop, who is already appointed in, reversiºn,
will succeed. This gentleman is a student in the Temple, but he will be subject to the
provisions of an act which will limit the emoluments.’
Such offspring of archbishops are indeed fortunate in their berth.
To be sure, the emoluments of the student in the Temple are to be
limited; but they will bear that, as their limitation will not exactly
correspond to the limits of the work and labour done for them. The
principle of a fair day's wages for a fair day's work, indeed, would
reduce them to less than an infinitesimal sum; since, whilst the
remuneration of the registrarship of the Prerogative Court of Canter-
bury, is represented by figures, its duties may be expressed by a ;
W. ; value to its possessor is £10,984 a year, its utility to anybody
else is 724.
ºf nothing to do for nearly twenty thousand pounds per annum,
how well the Archbishop's registrar does it, SIR BENJAMin thus
exemplifies in a postscript:—
“By the same Report, No. 711, session 1850, pages 93 and 94, it appears that so little
care was taken of the documents in the registrar's office, ‘that several papers were
nothing more than dust.’ ‘That even the wills were not sound they are mended with
paste and paper.’ ‘They are kept in a place called Pennyless Porch.'”
º
Pennyless Porch is a very
- - appropriate name for the repository of
wills on which the exaction º
- probate dues has helped to beggar
widows and orphans. This consideration, again, is suggestive of the
strong parental feeling of archbishops, which is peculiar, and closely
resembles that of certain archprelates of the winged race—golden
eagles, which not only take care to feather their nests, but make a prey
of the lambs for their own young.
In studying the natural history of archbishops and golden eagles, let
us dwell on their love of offspring, their storge, their philo-progenitive-
ness, with . on the amiable features in their dispositions only.
Let us overlook the gloomier and more painful traits in their natures,
such as devouring the lambs—whom the archbishops, in truth, are
rather supposed to feed.
But in the meanwhile we cannot do better than follow the example
of archbishops in taking care of our children. Why should their
patrimony, after our decease, be confiscated, to the amount of the
impositions of the ecclesiastical court, for the benefit of the see, of
Canterbury To gorge the archiepiscopal eaglet, the registrar of the
Prerogative Court, it appears, ſor one thing—and not the least. It
may be very natural for the aquiline prelates to eat up our ...;
but it is equally natural for us to do all we can to preserve our
and sucklings from their aerie: and whilst we admire the parental
fondness of these birds of prey, we hope SIR BENJAMIN HALL will
persuade the House of Commons to allow us and ours to be no longer
their quarry.
JENKINS LET LOOSE AGAIN.
PUNCH has a duty to perform. He must, very mildly, remonstrate
with JENKINs—who has, somehow, found his way into the Herald, for
Punch can swear to the hue of the plush—in order that he may, if
possible, season his admiration. JENKINs is at LoRD LonDesBorough's,
and listen to him :
“The company were received by Lady LoNDEsnoRough, who was attired in the
splendid diamond tiara, which no one who visited the Crystal Palace could fall to
recognise as the same that there had attracted so much admiration. This, placed on
such a head as that now familiar to the public by GRANT's beautiful portrait of her lady-
ship, in the Royal Academy, and coupled with the most perfect affability of manner,
seemed from the moment of introduction into a suite of magnificent rooms to diffuse a spell
within their precincts.”
The diamonds on such a head, with affability, diffused a spell!
What sort of spell? And wherefore should a gentlewoman be thus
advertised by the profane JENKINs? Can, he not be decently awe-
struck by the diamonds? Can he not placidly sink from five feet ten-
that was the height be advertised himself, when last out of place-to
four foot two, crushed by the diamonds, and so crushed, be quiet?
JENKINs, however, moralizes, when contemplating Colt's revolvers:
“Between the pistols and the flaz which might upon occasion be converted into an
excellent shroud, some pieces of plate were exhibited by MR. Montague.”
Dear JENKINs, no more of that. No cross-bones in that flunkey
mouth. Keep to diamonds, and clean the “pieces of plate.”
A paper-weight elephant is shown:
“As a model of a heavy subject by an Irish artist, Messrs. ELKINGTox should lose
no time in forwarding it to the Cork National Exhibition,' observed a little gentleman,
with a point laced cravat, at our elbow. ‘Yes, sir, was the comment of an odd-looking
man, with a bald head, at our other elbow, “cork is sure to buoy (pronounced with the
splutter of a determined punster buy) it up.' ... We at once considered these cases
incurable, as a disgusting habit seldom acquired by studious men-DEAN Swift and
a few others excepted.”
Puns isn't allowed in our pantry, says JENKINs. They is decidedly low.
“As we entered the library, three or four well-known words passed through our
memory, which we shall not presume to translate—
“Armavirumque cano;
But why not translate P All the servants do not know Latin. Among
other celebrities JENKINs observes “the amiable EARL OF RossE; ”
we presume the nobleman who constructed that darling telescope.
§. men were present; and no doubt among them the de-
lightful WHEATstone who invented that love of an electric telegraph
with HERscHEL, who has somewhere found out such ducks of stars.
- in
Protectionist Toasts.
THE Protectionists have been very prodigal lately at their public
dinners with their toasts. ...We advise them, as friends, to make the
best use of their time, for it is perſectly clear that if they succeed in
making bread, dearer, the loaf will become much smaller; and it is
equally clear that when the loaf is only half its present size, the Protec-
tionists can only enjoy half their present round of Toasts.
MILItARY INDOLENCE.
A MEMBER of the Peace Society, who goes the whole lamb, wants to
know whether the very extreme of idleness must not prevail in the
Army, when soldiers not only do not exercise any industrious employ-
ment, but are actually, on some occasions, compelled to deploy
A Paragraph only to be Read by the Ladies.
EveRy Man has his price, so said WALPOLE; but, he never said as
much of Woman. The fact is, WALPole judged the ladies only too
correctly, for he knew as well as we do, that many of those dear
creatures are beyond all price! (We expect a pair of embroidered braces,
at least, for the above.—ED. PUNCH.)
PROTECTIONIST ESTIMATES.
PERHAPs the most curious item in the estimates agreed to by thu
Protectionist Government is the estimate that has been formed of our
national honour, which (vide the MATHER case) has been set down at
two hundred and forty pounds.

A WISER AND A BETTER MAN.
E-
SANGUINARY OUTRAGE ON A DEFENCELESS
FOREIGNER.
MARLBoRough STREET Police. —THE Honour ABLE, CRAVEN
DRAGONET, a Captain in the Guards, was brought before the sitting
Magistrate, charged with the following ruffian-like and cowardly
assault upon Giuseppe Piccoluomo, an Italian organ-boy.
It appeared that CAPTAIN DRAGONET and a party of his men were
returning from their morning parade, or whatever it is called, at St.
James's Palace, when the lad unintentionally got in the Captain's way,
which so exasperated the gallant officer, that he drew his sword, and
cut the poor little fellow down. -
Police Constable A 500, deposed that he was on duty that morning
in St. James's Street, when he saw the soldiers, with the defendant at
their head, come marching up towards Piccadilly. The organ-boy was
playing and dancing to some ladies at a window, and, whilst occupied
in so doing, failed to notice the approach of the military, and backed
into their line of march. The defendant called to him to get out of the
way, but before the boy had time to move, pulled out his sword, and
with that weapon inflicted a stroke upon his head, which felled him to
the ground. He (the policeman) ran immediately to the assistance of
the youth, whose crown had been cut open, and was bleeding profusely,
He carried him to the next surgeon's, and then proceeded in search of
the defendant, whom, as soon as he (defendant) was off duty, he took
into custody whilst stepping into a brougham. -
MR. McNAB, the surgeon, said he found the boy with an incised
wound in the scalp, three inches in length, laying bare the aponeurosis o
the occipito-frontalis muscle. The patient's tall conical hat had been
completely cleft, and, but for its substance having deadened the force
of the blow by opposing a tough resisting medium to the passage of
the weapon, the cranium would have been divided, and the result would
have been fatal.
The boy was here produced in court, with his head bandaged, looking
very pale and weak from loss of blood. He confirmed, the evidence of
the preceding witnesses through an interpreter, and declared that his
getting in the Captain's way was quite unintentional, and that he had
done nothing that he knew of to give him any provocation.
The Magistrate told the defendant that he (defendant) was now at
liberty to make any statement he might think *. but informed him
that º said anything tending to criminate himself, it would be used
against Illm.
CAPTAIN DRAGONET, who appeared to treat the charge with great
levity, said he was not sorry, on the whole, that the young ºf had
escaped with his life. The little vagabond had not only got in his way,
but when ordered to stand aside, had made a derisive gesture by putting
his hands to his nose.
The lad on being questioned whether he had done so, replied, that he
had merely raised his hands instinctively in self-protection, expecting,
from the Captain's angry voice, a box on the ear.
The defendant said he thought at the time, and believed still, that
the act was intended for impertinence, It would never do for an
officer on duty when trifled with, to stand on ceremony. He was sure
the Magistrate was quite aware of that, . He had an appointment, and
would thank his Worship not to detain him.
The Magistrate said he was sorry to say that this was a case in
which he could not accept bail.
The defendant, exhibiting, considerable astonishment, declared he
really could not understand what his Worship meant.
The worthy Magistrate said it certainly did appear that the de-
fendant was not aware of the yery serious position in which he had
laced himself. He (defendant) had narrowly escaped standing at that
º on a charge of wilful murder. As it was, he should be under the
{j of committing him to Newgate to take his trial at the Central
Criminal Court for cutting, and wounding, with intent to commit that
crime, or some grievous bodily harm.
- º: Captain, apparently thunderstruck at this decision, was removed
in the Wan.
*...* Mr. Punch Fº his compliments to MR. HARDwick, and
begs to say, should MR. HARDWICK not exactly be able to remember
any such case as the above to have occurred at Marlborough Stree
that Mr. Punch's reporter is subject to fits of somnambulism, in one o
which he may have had a dream, wherein his imagination transformed
a ruffian in a certain foreign service into a British officer, and brought
a dastardly savage who, under Austrian law, sabred an unarmed man
with impunity, before a London Magistrate.
A Natural Inference.
THE Derby Prophets, it appears, were this year even more than
usually incorrect in their prophetic guesses; and as they every week so
abundantly advertise their appreciation of a speedy payment for their
“tips,” we may º: be pardoned the assumption that their business
is transacted on the principle of “quick returns and small prophets.”

THE IN.com E-TAX supeRSEDED !
*—fx T is self-evident to the com-
monest booby that the Income-
Tax can be fairly adjusted in
no other manner than by
taking the excess of it off pre-
carious earnings and profits,
and distributing the burden
so removed over permanent
property. The CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER has in-
timated that the Income-Tax
Committee, after much de-
liberation, is likely to arrive
at a conclusion to the same
effect. But MR. DISRAELI
also hints that such a mode
of equalising the impost would
be so unpleasant to permanent
property, that permanent pro-
perty would never stand it.
The only thing to do, then,
is to abolish the Income-Tax,
and to find a substitute for it
less unpopular.
He who has nothing ought to contribute his º share of it to the national hat—the
Crown; and so on in due proportion indefinitely upwards. By how much any one person
or class of persons is º more in relation to their means than another, by so much is
the property of that class or that person confiscated, and he, or it, plundered outright.
It is perhaps impossible, in taxing a complicated society, to do without a little confiscation;
only that injustice is to be avoided as much as may be. Many taxes, present themselves to
the mind, as less open to objection on this account than the Income-Tax; , There might, for
instance, be a tax upon noses, proportioned to their length, which would press chiefly on
the aristocracy and the Hebrew community; but the aquilines would turn º at the idea
of such an impost, and the snubs would signify to you that they wished you might get it.
The most rational, moral, wholesome, salubrious, and feasible tax that could be devised in
lieu of the income Tax, would be a tax on fat ople; whereby all would be taxed according
to their substance. This º is quite disinterested; the author is upwards of twelve
stone when last weighed, and is a growin, middle-aged man. - - - -
As a tax upon necessaries is the worst of taxes, so the least objectionable is a tax upon
manifest superfluity, Fat people must, at least, have plenty to eat and drink, unless in the case
of disease, }. which exemption should be allowed, on attestation by a medical certificate.
A fat-tax is one, to incur which would be in a great measure optional. Its amount would be
reduced in proportion to the reduction of obesity, to be effected by moderation, exercise, and
early rising, on all which good habits it would act as a premium.
Those whom a tax on the º would princi affect, would be mayors and alder-
men; also corpulent bishops, deans, canons, and pluralists: the very persons best able to
bear depletion. Fat people, moreover, generally, are the most eligible subjects for taxation,
for nobody sympathises with them; àf if, being oppressed, they attempted to get up a cry,
they would only raise a laugh. . . - -
#. assessment of the fat subject should be based on the excess of the periphery, in each
individual, over the natural standard, in relation to the height. It should be made by a
medical man; and thus Government would have an opportunity of bestowing some patronage
on a profession which it has hitherto shamefully neglected. - -
It may be objected that a Fat People Tax would check º; not so: it would only
diminish plethora. If it lessened the demand for meat, it would give an impetus, to hides,
which would be wanted for shoe-leather to supply the wear and tear, which it would, occasion
by stimulating pedestrianism. Should it cause a decrease in exciseable liquors, the deficiency
would be compensated by the additional duty that would be obtained in consequence of its
promotion of horse exercise. -
The CHANCELLOR or THR, ExchEQUER is gratuitously welcome to this idea for a budget,
if his agricultural friends will allow him to use it, as it is to be feared they will not; although
it i. tend to relieve the land of its burdens by effecting a diminution of their own
weight.
T}E LUNATICO.
SUPPose a gentleman were to go about dropping into Courts of Justice, and grinning
and winking at the judges;, were to walk into the House of Commons, and slap its most dis-
tinguished members on the back and thigh, and, wherever he went, were to indulge in similar
antics and extravagances. Suppose he wound these eccentric proceedings up with an act that
placed him at the bar of the Central Criminal Court, would he not be acquitted of the deed,
on the ground of being irresponsible for his actions? And would he not be ordered to be
detained in Custody during her MAJESTY's *. And would not everybody, say that
this was shutting the stable door after the horse-stealing had been accomplished, and
that the unfortunate gentleman ought to have been taken care of long before ?
In the mean time, perhaps, there are certain bereaved relatives, mourning a now irreparable
loss which might have been remedied.
A SUGGESTION FOR THE WAR OFFICE.-We beg to recommend to our military authorities
that, as an elementary...lesson, for raw recruits just commencing practice with firearms, a
figure, dressed as a British soldier, should be used as a target, for it is proved by experience
at the Cape, that nothing can form a finer mark, or one that is more easy to hit.

We won't go home till morning, &c.
While one of you is prosing,
The weary may be dozing,
On cushion'd bench reposing,
With inattentive ear;
In spite of cries of “ Hear!”
And cheer and counter-cheer,
So musically snoring,
Whilst some “Adjourn!” are roaring—
The speech their patience boring—
Or cry like chanticleer.
Chorus.
We won't go home till morning, &c.
How slow will creep each moment,
As on tº Endowment

There’s too much cause to fear,
That very strongly savour
Of humbug's subtle flavour,
To curry popular favour,

Chorus.
We won't go home till morning, &c.
Then furious, wild, and frantic,
Will rave—with gestures antic,
Outpouring bulls gigantic,

When some opponent's jeer
Will drive the whole band raving;
In such a way behaving,
That I, the tempest braving,
Shall have to interfere.

Chorus.
We won't go home till morning, &c.
And if you're tired of talking,
Yet do not think of walking;
But, legislation balking,
Stop Government's career,
In opposition sheer,
The measure whatsoe'er;
Division on division
Will put off all decision;
Thus let us earn derision
For business in arrear.

My FRIENDs, the EARL or DERBy—alias the RUPERT of DEBATE

case of the worst, made his political will, and set his red box in order.

prudence, has leſt º: chance. The verdict may the wrong

Folks have been told to trust in Derby—to stand by RUPERT-to

RESPECTED PUNCH,
“THE enclosed fragment wrapped up a piece of cheese, which
formed yesterday's lunch, and as it will certainly be of as much use to
}. as to me, I send it without delay. It seems to be part of a letter
rom some old schoolmistress, to a niece, whose schooling has not been
quite the thing, but of that you will be a better judge than I.
“Your's faithfully,
“A CoNSTANT READER.”
“My DEAR MARY ANNE.-Although I perceive, and perceive with
delight, that you have conquered some of the chief difficulties in polite
pronunciation, that you are no longer in doubt as to where you should
place the * (I mean the H, dear), and that your choice between
the V and the W is guided by something like a fixed principle, I would
not have you suppose that all necessity for further exertion is at an end.
“At present, my beloved niece †. err not so much in pronunciation
as in the selection of º. and I deeply regret that the cares of my
establishment at Peckham prevent me from attending you more con-
stantly, and checking each inelegance as it presents itself. I was
much grieved, for instance, when I heard that at a very select tea-
º you alluded to the engagement of MR. SMITH to Miss BRowN,
saying that they kept company. If there was any occasion to
allude to the delicate fact at all (which I very much doubt), you should
simply have said that MR. SMITH was “engaged’ to Miss BRowN—
no more.
“I have also observed that you are somewhat lax in your formation
of the preterite tense, sa ºf “I done it,' instead of “I did it,” and ‘I
see him yesterday,’ instead of “I saw him.’ Study, Ibeg, with increased
attention, the list of verbs I enclosed in my last. Be careful, too, in
your use of adjectives, and do not let a desire to give greater force or
point to your observations, betray you into inelegance. I do not for a
moment, suspect that you make use of such expressions as “stunning,”
‘out-and-out good,” “jolly,” and so forth, for F. those as male
vulgarities, from which the female mind instinctively shrinks. But I
fear you have allowed yourself to use “spicy” as a word of com:
mendation, and my emotions are not to be described, when I heard
that you praised a fashionable waistcoat, by the employment of some
such horrid word as “scrumptious” or “scrumptuous.
." Many learned persons, I am, aware, consider that much of the
wisdom of our ancestors is couched in the proverbial form, but notwith-
standing that %. (for which I have the greatest deference), I cannot
but think the form most infelicitous, when used to convey the morai
and social convictions of a young Fº Thus, you might remark that
the *:::::. of a plan is shown by the result, without exclaiming
that the ‘proof of the pudding is in the eating,' and the charitable
doctrine, that even the most reckless profligate is capable of reforma-
tion, might surely be set forth in other terms, besides those which
declare that “it is a long lane that has no turning.” And I have
observed that when you utter, an expression of the sort, you add “I
say, in a very loud tone of voice, and with an air of superior wisdom,
as if the proverb were your own particular creation. This, my dear
MARY ANNE, is very vulgar.
"It gives me much pain to find that you are ambitious to obtain a
character for wit, since this propensity is a frequent cause of indecorum.
MR. WIGGINs, f own, should not, have said the other, evening that
the “tankard ran,” but should rather have said “leaked,” yet it was
wrong of you to answer him by remarking that the “ale ran and not
the tankard,” and then to look round at the company for applause.
Nor was it at all necessary on your part to state, when you were in-
formed that somebody had a bad cold, that you had never heard of a
good one. Again, though I admit that ºf is more charming than
‘serenity,” I cannot approve of the phrase ‘all's serene,’ as an indi-
cation that some difficulty has been surmounted., Believe me, that
those who encourage you in the use of what is called “smart’ language,
are no true friends.

THE LANDLORD’S ELECTRO-BIOLOGY.
THERE is scarcely anything that is really new; what is commonly so
called is a familiar fact in a novel form—an old friend with a new face.
The science of Electro-Biology, for example, on which itinerant phi-
losophers are nowlecturing about the country, has long been practicall
known—at least to fº. in the habit of dining at taverns. Suc
gentlemen will testify to the circumstance of having been themselves
operated upon more or less successfully, on various occasions, in the
manner following: -
Some wine having been ordered after dinner, is discovered to be
brandied, corked, or otherwise objectionable, and the landlord is sent
for to be remonstrated with in regard to it. The proceeding which he
then adopts will be recognised, by all who have witnessed electro-
biological experiments, as strictly electro-biological. At first, indeed,
he affects astonishment at the complaint about the wine, appearing to
take the truth of the impeachment for granted.
As if just to satisfy himself, however, on that point, he pours out a
little of the condemned liquid and tastes it. His look of surprise
changes to an expression of hesitation; he tastes again—the uncer-
tainty becomes decision—and then he says firmly, yet with deference:-
“Really, gentlemen, I think your taste must have been a little out of
order—do try this wine again.” Here he holds his glass up to the
light. “Pray be so kind as to observe the bees-wing there, Sir,” and
so saying he contrives to make the patient also hold his glass up, and
to fix his attention on something floating in the wine. Leaving him
with his gaze thus fastened, he enters into the history of the wine,
states its vintage, the time it has been in bottle, and the different
Majors and other º: of distinction who have commended it.
All this while, the patient is squinting at a fixed object in the liquid,
and by the time mine host has concluded his dissertation, is quite pre-
d to give in to the challenge, “Now, Sir, I defy you to tell me that
#. not a glass of excellent port l” - -
In precisely the same way may some susceptible subjects be pre-
vailed upon to take Marsala for Sherry, and the most arrant Goose-
berry for. Champagne, and to pay accordingly. This is precisely
Electro-Biology; only a better name for the operation—if electricity
has anything to do with it—would perhaps be Electro-Gammon.

though all of them were spun out of the brains of the Mimbers P

the sweet syllables that come, like fairies, through the sea.

Hibernia. For ever and ever, and longer still. What are you doing,

Britannia. Well, we're tumbling to pieces—but, bother Parliament!

in Parliament that would rather pay it—if it could be done privately—

THE WAGNER WAR.
THE musical history of our time affords no parallel to this exciting
contest. . Not in London merely, but throughout the kingdom, its
influence is now deeply felt; and that which was at first regarded as
a mere managerial dispute, now threatens lastingly to affect the peace
of the musical world at large.
Though startling to some, the rupture by no means was a wholly
unexpected one. Hostilities have long been secretly impending, and
the arrival of the German cantatrice was seized as the signal for openly
commencing them. That lady, however, is but ...iii.; the HELEN
of the war. The real question at issue is briefly, this:
From time immemorial almost, it has been held (among themselves)
that public singers, in general, are a privileged class; complete
exceptions to all egal rules, and utterly exempt from the vulgar duty of
keeping a contract-unless it thoroughly suits their interest and con-
venience to do so., Engagements, in fact, have hitherto “professionally.”
been regarded as binding upon one side only; not that which gives the
services, but that which pays for them... The Manager, it is held, must
perform his part of the bargain as a matter of course; but the Singer
is traditionally left open to make a better one elsewhere, should the
opportunity offer. The very wording of the contract, it is pleaded,
admits the existence of but, one Voice in the matter. Upon this the
Managers have at length joined issue; and we confess their doing so
has not surprised us. .
In our position of universal Umpire, we have, of course, been most
voluminously appealed to on this momentous question. , Scarcely a
postman, passes without dropping a small ºlº: of Notes and
Queries into our letter-box; and we are hourly haunted by the appari-
tion of some breathless “constant reader,” who comes in person for an
answer to his yet unopened missive. One of our earliest visitors was a
ntleman who has for many years been regarded as one of the
rightest ornaments of the Alfresco or Tea-Garden School. This vocal
“veteran” is now, unfortunately, rather in a fix. Animated by the
. of the gifted Johanna, it appears that he has been taking a
complete leaf out of her engagement-book, and with a most cucum-
brian coolness, has ratified his simultaneous services to the managers
of no less than three of our cheap suburban “Halls of Harmony.”
Each of these, we understand, is an expressly “exclusive” contract;
so that by, no possibility can he º any one of them, without
legally rendering himself accountable for, at least, a pair of breaches.
This is by no means an isolated case. We have at our pen's point a
dozen such at least; but we think the present will suffice to show that
the infection called Wagnerism is spreading most rapidly throughout
the musical profession, and that the lower as well as the higher circles
#: will, ere long, deeply feel, and, as we think, deplore, its
uence.

AGAIN, OUR INSANE ARTIST.
It is our painful duty to announce that this maniacal miscreant has
again assaulted us. We consider ourselves bound to draw attention
to the fact, not so much for our own as for our country's sake. Fallen,
indeed, were England, in the eyes of sister nations, if it were known
that lunatics run riot in her streets, and defy the arm of justice in open
staring day ! -
The particulars of the outrage are briefly these. º freed from
the cares of office, we were as usual drag-ging to the Derby, and
rather damply rendering ourselves to the annual joviality of the occa-
sion, when our progress and attention were alike arrested by our near
wheel being firmly locked in the embraces of an antiquated hackney-
coach. We mentally stared, of course, to see so obsolete a trap upon
the Derby i. and not unnaturally wondered who on earth could be
insane enough to patronise it. But the mystery was soon, most
lamentably solved: for, just as we were pouring in a rattling volley of
“chaff,” suddenly down went the window of the exploded vehicle, and
É. . horror out popped the head and shoulders of our miserable
tlen
* * * When we recovered our senses, the hackney-coach had
vanished; but its wretched occupant, we found, had taken a terrible
º of his temporary, juxta-position. There lay at our, feet a
maniacal note, folded, we §ld see, in literally frantic haste, and .
an almost hieroglyphical address. By painful experience we recogni
the scrawl, and summoning alike our courage and our eyeglass, we
desperately cracked the seal, and read as follows:-
“A PICTURE OF DISMAY.”
“Portrait of our nervous friend, SpaigqLEs, drawn for the Militia."

till lunch time.
England must'nt Expect too Much.
It seems that the Ministers have repudiated their own policy, abroad
as well as at home, for the case of MR. MATHER seems to show that they
abandon the duty which should give protection to their own country-

OUR RACING PROPHECY.
If the Betting offices are not put down before next year, we should
suggest something like the following as a programme for the next Cup
day at Ascot:—
The Footman's Plate—of three dozen spoons and half a dozen forks,
by subscription of a spoon or a fork each. Every subscriber to remové
the initials and crest, or forfeit one shilling.
The Tradesmen's Cup-by subscription of half-a-crown each from their
masters' tills by the London shopmen.
The Butchers' Stakes—of one hundred pounds, open to all the metro-
politan butchers' boys.
The betting will be limited to the Betting offices, and the final settling
will take place at one of the penal settlements.
Agricultural Distress.
The English and Australian agriculturists, it would seem, are now
alike “distressed,” and from diametrically opposite causes. Here, it is
the want of gold affects them: there, the glut of it.
SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS FOR LADIES; OR BANE
AND ANTIDOTE.
E saw in a fashionable newspaper, a
paragraph headed “The RAces
AND THE FETEs,” being a per-
fumer's advertisement in disguise,
which informs “ladies attending
on these occasions” that they
“would do well to provide them-
selves” with some stuff which it
calls “Aqua d'Oro,” and adds:
“This fragrant and spirituous perfume
refreshes and invigorates the system
during the heat and dust of summer, and
will be found an essential accompaniment
for the opera, the public assembly, and
the promenade. In all cases of excitement,
lassitude, or over-exertion, it will prove of
great advantage taken as a beverage, dilute
with water.”
The British sailor, in the song,
exclaims, with an imprecation,
that there is nothing like grog.
Jack's declaration is erroneous as
well as profane. The perfume,
Aqua d'Oro, “diluted with water,”
is very much like grog, and if
“taken as a beverage” in any quantity, would very soon produce the
same effect. Yet if ladies must drink fragrant and spirituous perfumes,
they would probably find good Schiedam or fine old Jamaica Pine-apple
Rum more wholesome; or a portable flask of eau-de-vie might be recom-
mended in preference to a smelling-bottle. On the whole, however
perhaps it would be advisable for ladies who go to the races to avoid
the distillery-drinks altogether, and stick to the Champagne,
The same puff also extols the virtues of a cosmetic, called “Kalydor,”
which, as it avers, eradicates among other blemishes, "spot; imples
and discolourations.” If it really does this, the Aqua d'Oro an
the Kalydor should go together: the ladies who purchase the former to
drink, should also buy the latter to remedy the effects of the º:
namely those peculiar blossoms, whose development on the face is the
well-known consequence of indulgence in alcoholic fluids.
Sympathetic Show ERs.-The rain on the Ascot Cup day seems to
have exercised a curiously sympathetic influence upon the Betting-
house proprietors. It was astonishing what a number of them were
found next morning to have “mizzled.”

Now, gentlemen, are you aware that you no doubt offended the
monarchical principles of the republican Minister? ...About a fortnight
ago, did not that estimable gentleman . the Fishmongers' Com-
pany because it numbered among its late members the man who “killed
the rebel WAT TYLERP” Yes—rebel was the word! The represen:
tative of a nation of successful rebels rejoiced that the rebel TYLER had
bitten Smithfield dust!
Now, the Minister who can rejoice over the body of sprawling TYLER
—of the rebel who would not quietly see his child profaned by the tax-
gatherer—cannot admire the disaffection of EDMUND BURKE in his
praise of the rebels to KING GEORGE-the tens of thousands of rebels
on the other side of the Atlantic. -
The Americans ought to have paid the money-held their peace and
their allegiance. Even as WAT TYLEk ought to have paid the poll-tax
for his daughter, or have permitted the test proposed by KING
RICHARD's officer.
The Minister who condemns WAT TYLER must, logically, condemn
WASHINGTON, even though the Minister misrepresent the success of
the rebellion of which WashingtoN was the ſº and the hero.
Therefore, gentlemen, take warning: consider the delicate position of
the American Minister for the future—and further consider that
I remain your obedient servant,

RACY THOUGHTS
Of a Young Man on coming home from Ascot, wet through, and having
lost all his Money.
THE reason why Racing is generally called “The Turf,” must be
owing to the fact of so many green blades being found upon it; and
I’m sadly afraid I’ve been one of them to-day. - -
If the jockeys were weighed, previous to the race º to their
moral, instead of their physical, weight, it is to be feared that there
are exceedingly few who wouldn't be found wanting.
A person can lose his money very quickly on the Stock Exchange, or
by m ing a theatre, or by throwing it down a mine, or by burying it
under a . of houses; but it’s a serious question if Racing will not
get through his fortune much quicker in the long run.
The man who stakes his fortune upon the four feet of a horse
* feel surprised if, in the running, his fortune becomes forfeited
also.
In gambling there is no gratitude... Let one man beggar another,
either at cards, or at billiards, or on the Turf, or at pitch-and-toss-I
don't care what the method of beggary may have been; but do you think
he feels in the least grateful to the man whose money, he has won
, Racing is only another kind of dice-throwing, with this difference,
that you throw with horses instead of dice, and with this disadvantage,
that the horses have jockeys, and the dice none. The game is very
simple, and a very pretty one to look at... You put the twenty horses
all together—rattle them well—and when they come tumbling out
running at their full speed over the green course, I defy you to tell
which number will turn up the winner. It is all over in one minute,
and it is doubtful at which of the two games a person can lose most at
a single throw. - - -
The man who believes in his luck at racing is doomed to be a penni-
less man, let him be as rich as all the RothschilDREN of Israel put
together' - - - --
Confound it! The best part of the race, after all, is the champagne
and the eating and drinking. . If you are betting, you cannot enjoy
your “grub.” You are thinking of the stakes, and how much you
. have to fork out—instead of being intent, as you should be, upon
forking out the stakes which are at the bottom of the pigeon-pie. at
a fool I was to stick to any other -
There is no fool so illiterate but who imagines he can go upon the
Turf, and “make a book l’” - - -
The thimblerig-men, I maintain, are an injured set of beings; They
were suppressed, whilst the members of the betting-ring were left, un-
touched. Compare the two together, and I doubt if there would be
found a pea to choose between them. -
I have lost my money, am discontented, miserable, and wet to the
skin. I cannot imagine a more pitiable being than I am at the present
moment, and yet such is the infatuation of racing, that I really believe
if there were men and big sign-posts stationed at every step to bawl
out as loud as they could, “You mustn't go upon the Turf”—that still,
still I should be rushing upon it again to-morrow, in spite of all their
injunctions, and in spite of my own experience that I was sure to be
punished for it!
Inviolability of Bishops.
MR. HoRsMAN has obtained a majority for an inquiry, that will never
take place, into the conduct, of the Bishop QF BATH AND WELLs for
appointing MR. BENNETT, the martyr of St. Barnabas, to Frome. The
whole matter will end in smoke; for let a Bishop do what he may, says
MR. DISRAELI, Parliament has no power to touch him. The lawn is
tº: mail—the silk apron the nine bull-hides of AJAX.
hus, RABELAIs makes a Bishop put himself into frontipialibus when
about to commit the heaviest sin; and for this reason—that has in
some sort survived—sinning as a Churchman, the secular arm cannot
lay hold upon him.

A CHANCERY BONE OF CONTENTION.
(AN OWER TRUE TALE.)
OUR newspaper contemporaries
ought really to engage an
efficient staff of first-rate
writers of, romance to do
justice to the reports of the
proceedings in the Courts of
-- Chancery. A mere matter-
of fact style becomes “pale”
and ineffective in dealing
with subjects that surpass
in extravagance the wildest
and most exciting matters
of fiction.
What might not a fever-
ish imagination make of the
following “little affair” that
came off the other day in the
^ Court of Sir R. T. KINDERs-
LEY? The question in the
case was whether an old
lady, who died in 1827 § twenty-five years ago, which is nothing in
the age of a Chancery suit), had by her º executed a power of appoint-
ment, reserved to her º her marriage settlement. -
One would imagine the question would be simple enough, and easily
answered; but sixteen counsel were employed in arguing that, she
had, and that she hadn't. The negative position was supported by
MessRs. KENyon PARKER, HAYNEs, and OLIVER; while the affirmative
was sustained by MR. T. C. WRIGHT, MR. L. WIGRAM, MR. J. LAw,
MR. KEENE, MR. WALKER, MR. BAcon, MR. T. HALL, Mr. BAGGALLY,
MR. BIGG, MR. J. RusseII, MR. TURNER, MR. KINGDON, and six-
teenthly and º: by MR. J. BAILEY. . It is wonderful how so
apparently small a bone of contention can give employment to the jaws
of no less than sixteen barristers.
This, however, is not all, for in a Chancery suit it is not sufficient to
have a standing army of standing counsel on both sides, but there is a
neutral position to be taken up by somebody, and on this occasion it
was filled by MR. Follett and Šſ. Busk, who “appeared for the
trustees,” who had no interest in the result either one way or the
other. No wonder “his Honour” said, that “after the number of cases
that had been cited he should reserve his judgment.” We defy any one
to have any judicial faculty left after listening to eighteen, barristers on
one point, and we would lay a wager—anywhere but at a betting office,
where those who lose pay, and those who, win don't receive—that
however simple the º the amount of learning” employed upon
it must have reduced it to a mass of inextricable confusion. Happily
for the sanity of Chancery suitors in general, they are usually dead
before it comes to their turn to have the matters in which they are
interested brought before the Court, and the survivors entitled to the
“fund” have been born to consider the “fund” as the sport of the law,
so that they really are in the position fallaciously ascribed to the eels,
and have become, by use, hardened to the process of skinning.
THE SETTLEMENT FOR THE CUP.
THE settlement for Ascot has gone off very much as might have been
expected—several of the losers having “gone off” in a most mysterious
manner. A large number of shop-boys who had for some time pre-
viously to the race “been making up a book,” have transferred their
attention to their masters’ books, which they have been º: to
“make up” in such a way as to meet the engagements they have
incurred, and some have attempted to settle their own accounts by
appropriating the proceeds of the accounts of their employers' customers.
An immense number of watches changed hands on the morning after
the race, and young Spooney, the linendraper's lad, who stood to win
forty pounds, on Woltigeur, ran away, to avoid being asked for forty
shillings which he had laid out—from the till—on the “favourite.”
Song of the Australian Shepherd.
THE flocks may leave the mountains,
And perish every fold;
But dust-dry be the fountains,
Ere I’ll forsake the gold!
SAUCE FOR THE MINT,
THE Mint authorities, in their delay with reference to the new Florin,
are almost as bad as the Court of Chancery, for they have shown ex-
treme tardiness in bringing matters to an issue.
RUINED HALLS.
DESERTED are the Courts of Common Law,
Westminster, in thy venerable Hall;
The County Courts away all business draw,
And Nisi Prius totters to its fall.
O'er benches, formerly where, thick as thieves,
Mustered an ample bar, the Judge presides,
Lone as an owl, amid the ivy-leaves
On some forsaken ruin, that abides.
Or should the Judges number two or three,
They sit in unregarded grandeur big,
No gaping multitude has come to see;
Below there's but a solitary wig.
That wig is asked if it has aught to move;
It answers with a shake—and not “My Lud; ”
No fine harangue succeeding, meant to prove
That black, in fact, is white, as clear as mud.
Those walls with quirk and cavil now resound,
Or cross-examination's furious roar,
Designed some timid witness to confound,
With humbug, and with sophistry—no more;
Save rarely, when high damages are laid,
Šuch as for broken hearts young ladies seek,
Aºi. to British juries being made,
y tongues eſtsoons inserted in the cheek.
The suitors all the County Courts have sought,
These have the causes, and are like to keep,
For they are shops where justice may be bought—
As itself dictates that it should be-cheap.
Fall, Nisi Prius, ne'er to rise again,
And perish those iniquities with thee,_
The laws of Doctor's Commons—and that den,
That sty, that sink, the Court of Chancery!
CORDIAL BONDS BETWEEN ENGLAND AND AUSTRIA.
THE DUKE OF CASIGLIANQ is a man of a sort of humour; he evi-
dently, has a relish for a grim joke, and must laugh—when risible—like
a death's-head. This deadly droll duke, writing to MR; SCARLEtt, on
the atrocity committed on MR. MATHER, offers as indemnity for the
Austrian sabre cut 1,000 francesconi; and the Duke
“Has reason to flatter himself that this act of generosity will be appreciated by the
British Government, and he congratulates himself beforehand [nothing like being
beforehand] that it may have the effect of contributing to draw closer the bonds of
‘. friendship and good understanding which always existed between the two
overnments."
A thousand francesconi, and for only one cut at an English gentleman:
why, such a handsome sum ought to purchase a cut-and-come-again.
However, we are to be all the better friends for the gash; if MR.
MATHER had been murdered outright, our amity would have passed all
former love of all former nations; and at only the small charge of 1,000
francesconi—£240 sterling!
Thus considered, the Austrian ruffian who cuts down an unarmed man
becomes the sweetest of pacificators. Beautiful are the sabres of the
peace-makers! ...And now our cordial bonds are drawn so closely To
tighten a knot, it is usual to throw water overit—the Austrian improves
upon this, and makes the water blood.
The Stuff of the Protectionist Banner.
THE present Ministers, when they were in Opposition, were always
talking of nailing their colours to the mast. Instead of that, some say
they have now hauled down the flag; but that is not the case—the
Protectionist colours are still flying: but this fact may not be generally
known, owing to a mistaken supposition that they are what is commonly
called True Blue. The standard of the Protectionists consists of what
ladies call “shot silk,” and changes its hue with every variety of invo-
lution which it assumes while wavering in the breeze.

Why, it's NEARLY Twelve o'clock, AND THE BRough AM has BEEN WAITING THIS
ODE TO OUR MARVELLOUS
CONTEMPORARY.
Thou art the Print for me,
ries Gowrier;
Such wondrous things in thee
Ever appear :
Toads pent in solid trees,
Enormous gooseberries,
All sorts of prodigies,
Right through the year.
Tales of sagacious dogs,

And showers of fish and frogs,
Most strange to hear:
Twins like the Siamese,
And winter swarms of bees,
Wise pigs and learned fleas,
Six-legged deer.
Mock suns and double moons,

Odd apes and strange baboons,
Ghost stories queer :
Dreams that have come to pass,
Brobdignag sparrow-grass,
Huge ox, amazing ass,

The English Press in Paris.
At the time of our going to Press,
we received intelligence that the
Correspondents of the Chronicle
and Daily News had been sºnt for,
and informed that Louis NApoleon
had not slept a wink during the
previous night; and that they, as
contributors to English journals,
would be held accountable if the
President did not enjoy the
soundest repose the night ſol-
lowing.
“AT HOME."
lovely hºoman (to brute of a Husband). “Good Gracious, WILLIAM—Fast Asleep! AND Not DREssed,
A PUSEYITE BURKE.
A Most desperate attempt was made the other evening at St. Stephen's,
showing, that although some old gentlemen complain that there is no
such a man as BURKE now-a-days in the House of Commons, that senile
complaint is unfounded. Qn MR. HoRsMAN's motion “ for a select
committee to inquire into the circumstances connected with the insti-
tution of the Rey. Mk. BENNETT to the Vicarage of Frome,” Mr. Glad.
STONE attempted to smother the proposed investigation, by means of a
quantity of Yarn, ingeniously spun into what might be termed a web of
sophistry. The determined endeavour was happily baffled by a strong
body of forty-five straightforward individuals, who deserve much credit
for their firm and sensible conduct. The motive of the intended deed
is not very clear, for though its effect, had it been accomplished, would
have been tº screen the suspected parties, they, according to their par.
liamentary."pal,” will have no cause to fear inquiry, but rather the
reverse. Bennett, as is well-known, is accused of being a confederate
with the papal gang, and the Bishop of BATH AND Wells is denounced
As his abettor. Should it prove that the Vicar or FROME had turned
Protestant previously to his induction to that living, both Bishop and
Vicar will, come off with flying colours, and will have reason to
rejoice at the failure of the effort to deprive them of an opportunity of
clearing their characters, which has been made by their #. ally,
the Member for Romanesque Oxford.
The National Portrait Gallery.
LoRD MAHON, with great good taste, intends to ſº a vote of
money for the formation of a National Portrait Gallery. Mr. Punch
here gives timely notice that he will not consent to sit, if his friend
Oliver Cromwell is not permitted to make one of the company. This
being considered, Mr. Punch has no objection to the Fancy Portrait of
Guy Fawkes, which MR. Spoon ER—having painted it in his own colours
-proposes to add to the collection.
KINDLY MEANT-It is with the best wishes that we recommend to
the notice of our Protectionist Ministers the perusal of a little book,
*ublished under the title of “The Stomach and its Difficulties.”
CHRISTMAS IN JUNE.
The severity of the season has called forth numerous acts of that
benevolent consideration for the necessities of the indigent population
for which the higher ranks in this country have always been remarkable.
Coals and blankets have been largely distributed by the leading nobilit
and gentry, including the merchant-princes of the metropolis; an
arrangements have been made for supplying fº families and
schools with good, warm, comforting soup. It is hoped that by these
means all that is possible has been done to temper the inclemency of
the skies to those whose means are inadequate to procure for them-
selves the requisite protection against the bitter blasts and cold of
summer. - - - -
Several of the aristocracy have issued cards for juvenile parties on
Midsummer-day, to play at blindman's buff and snap-dragon, and
dance the longest day out and the shortest day in. - -
The managers of the different theatres are busily engaged in getting
up pantomimes for the dog days.
The Militia not Drawn but Painted.
The Dutch, once upon a time, showed, how they could best combine
economy with a martial manifestation: they painted sentinels on their
sentry-boxes. Our Ministry, eschewing Dutch economy, have, never-
theless, passed the Militia Bill, by which they will enrol a force of no
more practical value than soldiers made of red paint. If we must have
an increased force, let us at least have the real thing; the more
especially as we are to pay for it. The Ministry may certainly draw the
Militia; but they had better have followed the cheaper mode of the
Dutch, and without previous drawing, at once painted it.
A Day of Resignations.
Seven AL rumours were afloat a few days ago that the DERby party
had resigned their offices, which remained vacant. On inquiry we ascer
tained that the DERby party alluded to consisted of a set of low gam-
blers, and that the offices are no other than the blackguard Bettin
offices, many of which were “resigned” on the day aſter the races,
have been “vacant” ever since.
