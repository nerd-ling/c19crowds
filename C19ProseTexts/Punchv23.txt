WHERE can no longer be any doubt of it—we must fortify ourselves. Our national defences being—for
the best part—our national hearts and bones, and sinews, must be put in the very soundest and strongest
condition; and, alive and hungry to the fact, could we fall upon a blither occasion, and, withal, a jollier
season, to set about putting ourselves in order, than on the occasion that at the same time gives to rejoicing
England another Volume of PUNCH, and another Christmas?
Another Volume of PUNCH may be modestly considered as at least another three-decker and another
regiment of cavalry and infantry added—and how economically added !—to the national forces. There are
so many elements of moral strength in every Volume of MR. PUNCH that, meekly conscious of what he has
bestowed upon his country in this his last contribution—he sits down (in anticipation) to his Christmas beef
and pudding with the lightest heart and strongest digestion.
For it is needful—says the QUEEN from her Throne—it is needful, my beloved people, that, without
wishing to rumple the peacock feathers of our lively neighbours, we look to our national defences. “They
must be settled for ever,” says MR. DisrAELI; great statesmen never condescending to legislate for an hour
less than eternity.
MR. PUNCH, then, having bestowed his usual Christmas gift—in a new volume for Christmas—in his benign
manner exhorts his countrymen, and especially his countrywomen (seeing how near and dear the sympathy is
between them l) so to improve the present Christmas, that it shall be to them as at once a grand national
review and a patriotic protest. Let the field of the table-cloth be as the field of a sham battle, with the foes
we are supposed “to hate, before us.”
Glorious Sirloin, as he blushes at the knife, may touch the heart with a thought of “stern delight.”
As his blood streams into the dish, let us smile with a new pride at one source of our national defences. How"
the hero bleeds; and how by his very blood does he make new heroes |

IV - PREFACE.
But consider the Christmas board; and chew, and swallow, and digest a moral, from all that it creaks
and groans under; and all for the strengthening of our national defences !
Consider this Goose ! How many geese will smoke upon John BULL's table; all of them, by the
contemplative spirit of the season, made types and representatives of the “proud insulting foreigner I " How
that army of geese vanishes, hardly leaving a drum-stick, behind How they are scattered and destroyed,
their memory imildly smelling of sage, and it may be “the meed of one melodious tear” granted in onions.
And then the Turkies—the tremendous force of turkies How they clamorously gobbled; and how—
with all their feathers rigid as though turned to steel (unplucked iron pens !) they stedfastly intended—turkey.
like—to fly at the Red | And where are the turkeys now f Thousands and thousands lie on the field of the
glorious table-cloth, in manacles of sausages. These, we say, in the sham battle of the Cloth of Diaper, represent
the fallen and enslaved; but we are generous enemies; we take them to our breasts (inside, too,) and
magnanimously break with our teeth the chains that bind them.
PLUM-Puddings | What has Cherbourg arsenal—what Vincennes of round shot in number and weight,
in comparison with the piles (nay, the Great Pyramids) of plum-puddings, all of them to fall, like spent shot,

fork, carry them

gather around that cauldron bowl, and with ghastly faces (for ten minutes 1) desperately plunge hands—(small
white hands and taper fingers, some hallowed with circle of gold, some it may be just thrilling with the notion of
it,)—desperately plunge hands into the boiling, blazing fire-water, therefrom extracting many a plum !—The
while the blue fire flickers on the ceiling, and in burning “gouts” drops upon the combatants and falls upon the
carpet. What is this but mimic war? What Snap-dragon, but type of the horrible, destroying, flame-breathing
real Dragon whose breath kills thousands, slaying even women and little children? And even women and little
children—should the real Dragon think to come—will take heart and strength to assail and kill him : tearing him
to pieces (no bigger than raisins), and as the flames of spirituous old Jamaica and old Cognac are quenched in
darkness, so quenching the desolating flames of the real Dragon: not Snap-dragon, but NAP-DRAgoN.
PUNch—exhorting all the folks of England, in this manner and at this season to fortify their national
and natural defences—wishes each and all of them
“A MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR.”

A “SMALL’’ GAGGLE AT THE CRYSTAL
PALACE.
WE welcome a little pamphlet by one “John SMALL, Fetter Lane,”
in reprobation º the resolution to place the Crystal Palace at
Sydenham, as an offshoot from the Brighton Railway. We welcome it:
for nothing GREAT ever yet succeeded that was not first hissed at
by some'hing very SMALL. We therefore hail the voice of SMALL as a
happy omen. We receive his arguments as witches sºy their prayers—
tº... and therefore count SMALL–“but that’s not much"—
amongst the Crystal champions, who shout “Hey for Sydenham, by
the Brighton Rail l’”
Nevertheless, SMALL shall beheard in his own tones. The public,”
says SMALL, “has an insuperable dislike to go East.” The wise men
of the public came from that point. “If it [the public] goes to
Greenwich, it is but once a year; and a day's fling amongst citizens,
coalmen, shop-boys, and domestic servants”—SMALL speaks of such
folks as becomes a Fetter Lane aristocrat—“will not do as a com-
mercial reliance for an enterprise which is to stand all the year and
every year.” SMALL suggests a south-western site: hundreds of
thousands, he says, journey to Hampton Court: and wherefore, oh,
SMALLEst of the SMALL } Because, at Hampton Court, there are
Hampton Gardens. Now, at Sydenham there will be Crystal Palace
Gardens ! Given the attraction, shall we not inevitably find the
visiting hundreds of thousands. Folks—those wretched people, the
what-d'ye-call-'em-yes, artisans, and so forth, go in multitudes “once
a year” [twice] into Greenwich; and wherefore only twice? Because
only twice a year is aught to be seen at all worthy of the holyday.
No: the thousands steam on to Rosherville; even as the thousands go
to Hampton. Now, take Rosherville, Richmond, and Hampton;
multiply all their combined attractions, five hundred or five thousand
fold, and place them under that Firmament of Crystal, in that Garden
of Eden in which Paxton shall be the great ADAM, and with snow on
our house-tops, we shall have—yes, even artisans, with their wives and
children, swarms of them—think of that, oh SMALL, amid your barbaric
gold and pearl of Fetter Lane-swarms of them at Sydenham sauntering
through orange-groves, wondering at bread-trees, beholding ginger
yet green, oh, SMALL-and breathing Ind and Araby. And this,
not to the south-west, but with nostrils south-east of London. We
shall not wonder to see SMALL himself, or one of his numerous
*ribe, gamboling, and after his own way, cracking his jokes on a
cocoa-tree.
But SMALL's aspirations and yearnings lie west; for westward live
dukes, and earls, and viscounts, dear to the small pin's-head heart of
SMALL. “The public,” says SMALL., “cannot feel the same confidence
in these men”—such folks, for instance, as one Joseph PAxton, and
individuals called Fox and HENDERson, and Owen Jones, and men of
that sort of name—“cannot hold them,” says SMALL, “to be the
creators and trustees of a national work, as the Exeter Hall men might
have been;" and then SMALL counts off upon his glowing finger-tips
the names of dukes, and earls, and viscounts. SMALL is very great on
this point. It is acknowledged that in England the nobility do every-
thing—the people nothing. We forget the name of the Duke who
engineered the Thames Tunnel; mankind do not remember the
Marquis who demonstrated and carried out the Electric Telegraph;
may, so oblivious are we of noble benefactors, that even the name of the
Earl who established the Penny Postage, for the moment escapes us.
Now, “untitled Directors”—writes a “Brighton Shareholder,” making
SMALL the very least, indeed—“did actually serve the Palace—did pay
money down to rescue it—did raise £500,000 to * it in all its
glory—and did secure the names of PAxton, Fox, WYATT, and Owen
Jones, to the back of the bill which they have drawn upon public con-
fidence, as a guarantee that the large amount raised shall be well spent,
and the national undertaking nobly carried out.” And truly, these
gentlemen (there is not a Duke among them) bring very decent cha-
racters from their last place—their Crystal House in Hyde Park.
But SMALL has, no doubt, a few flower-pots of land on the South-
Western line: haply, he may have a few shares. And that may be the
reason he cannot abide Sydenham; that the cause that fills the
public with “an insuperable dislike to go East.”
But SMALL, very fine by degrees, gets beautifully less as he proceeds
in his theme; and at last becomes so diminished, that he is no longer
visible to the naked eye. Even as the minutest of insects, engendered
in bad vinegar, he must be put under a microscope, ere, like the show-
man's º: we can duly consider him “from the end of the
snout to the tip of the tail.”

RESIDENT CANDIDATES.
IN default of any other qualifications, we find there are
several aspirants to Parliamentary honours in various
places, who rest their claims, on the fact of their being
“Resident Candidates.” The whole strength of their
addresses consists in the fact that their “address” happens
to be in the Borough they are desirous of representing. An
individual thus situated seems to think that the fact of his
having a “local habitation,” dispenses with the necessity
for his having “a name” in the place whose suffrages he is
soliciting. If he is a “resident,” he appears to think there
need only be one step from his own house to the House of
Commons.

MISS VIOLET AND HER “OFFERS.”
CHAPTER X.
“LADY Ossian l’” said papa, “and at this hour in the morning” (for
we were seated tâte-à-tête, as usual, at an unusually late breakfast, in
town, a few days after the Derby), “what on earth brings her unearthly-
ºf here? Will you see, Violet my dear?”
s I was leaving the room, LADY Ossian entered. What a hand-
some Scotchwoman she must have been, in other days, and in the style of
BLAck AGNEs of Dunbar! The keen dark eyes are still vivid, but the
tall thin figure, and severe features, now instil awe rather than
admiration into timid people. She has a terrific Scotch pedigree, and
I believe her ancestor was the sharp-witted nobleman who, when SIR
HENRY DE Bohun was struck down by Robert BRUCE, in the presence
of the two armies at Bannockburn, dismounted under pretence of
assisting the king, and subsequently contrived, by mistake, to find
himself on the back of the splendid English charger instead of his own
rather dubious animal. The family is understood to have persevered in
the ancestral practice of helping themselves, but, upon all occasions,
piously attributing, such help to Providence. , LApy Ossian is a
childless dowager, tolerably weel tochered, and she devotes herself a
§. deal to the conversion of Hottentots and to the extirpation of
apists. She is certainly a M. of very imposing appearance, and
her expression is what papa calls falconesque. In a drawing-room she
looks º aristocratic; but you would not think her out of
place if you saw her perched upon a mountain crag, and glowering upon
a harmless, flock of innocent º people below—a proud hawk
watching the poor pigeons pecking about... I have my own special
reasons for adding that LADY Ossian is aunt to SIR FINGAL MERVyN,
the Grenadier Guardsman, introduced in my last chapter.
“I want to run away, with your little girl, MR. BROMPTON, for a few
hours, if you can spare her,” said LADY OssiaN, looking at me so very
hawkishly, that I could |: imagine her making a great swoop across
the coffee-cups and clutching me.
“She will answer for her own engagements,” replied papa, looking
at me mischievously. “I never venture to interfere with the young
lady.” . As if he ever gave me a hint of a wish, dear old thing, without
my, feeling quite grateful to him for showing how I could please him,
“I am going to Exeter Hall,” said LADY Ossian, “and I should like
WIOLET to accompany me. I have reserved tickets, of course; only the
sooner we are there, the better.”
And we were there very soon. LADY Ossian would not enter the f
Hall at the great front door with the Greek word, meaning, I think,
“Brotherly Love,” over it, but went in at a side entrance. She
dashed ſearlessly at the angles and labyrinths of the interior, which
is divided into sets of chambers, the abode of Brotherly Love in All
its Branches... Until, one has read the inscriptions on the ground glass
in the doors, it is difficult to imagine how easily the labour of love can
be subdivided and split up. One set of subscribers exhausts its spiritual
affections upon the Polynesian heathen; another sends love and tracts
to the Copts and Nubians; and another, again, expends its philanthropy
upon the Juvenile Troglodytes of Moldavia. I did not, as we went
along, notice the apartments of any society in aid of English children
or of English emigrants; but I suppose these were up-stairs. Lady
OssiaN hurried me on, through various passages, and presently we
came into a very low-roofed place, where I could hear the buzz of a
great multitude. In a few minutes we were in the front of a little
gallery, high in air, where we could see everybody in the Hall, and
everybody could see us from head to foot.
Such an assembly. It is a striking sight, let the object be what it
may, to see several thousand people, peacefully gathered together, in
excitement, perhaps, but in no disorder, and concentrating their atten-
tion upon a subject which addresses it by no help of show or splendour.
For in Exeter Hall, itself one of the ugliest rooms in the world, there
is literally nothing to see, except the crowd that fills it. But this sight
quite bewildered me for some moments, for I had never beheld anything
like it, and I felt, for the first time, the imposing presence of a
multitude.
A large clock just then announced twelve, and, punctual as its own
works, there entered upon all parts of the platform a file of gentlemen,
some of them carrying blue wands. This was a signal for great applause,
other blue wands, planted in different parts of the room, rapping
violently. The file speedily took possession of the various chairs, except
the central one. A thin, precise- º: gentleman, in an evening dress
of black, with a high white cravat, and a look of sanctimonious self-
satisfaction, then turned to the meeting, and said in what I thought
was an unnecessarily solemn voice (but I hear he is a Member of Parlia-
ment, and adopts the same agreeable undertaker's manner, whether dis-
.* the means of Church Reform, or the price of Members mution.
chops)–
* move that the Honour ABLE JASPER CRowsFoot do take the
chair.”
“JAsper CRowsFoot!” I thought. “Why, that is the elderly gentle-
man who makes such a noise at the Opera, and shouts out when he
throws a bouquet at CERIto, just as a cricketer cries “Play!” when he
delivers a ball. What can he be doing here?”
There was quite a sensation, for it seems that Exeter Hall rather likes
an occasional recruit from the Opera stalls (if he have a title of any
kind), and pets him very indulgently. “A most gentlemanly man, a
º gentleman, and brother to an Earl,” passed rapidly along our
ittle gallery. And then forth stepped the Honour ABLE JASPER, look:
ing, perhaps, a little worn with forty years on town, but with a beautiful
black wig, the whitest of teeth, lemon-coloured gloves, and a geranium
flower in his button-hole. He made the meeting two very fine GEORGE
THE Fourth bows, smiled at the ladies in the galleries, dropped
into his chair, and put up his glass, all as naturally as if the overture
were over, and he were about to listen to GRISI's aria d'intrata:
There was some introductory business, and then a frightened-looking
gentleman read a long report. I suppose his nerves kept alternatin
between weakness and sudden strength, for he mumbled and hurrie
over most part of it; but would sometimes suddenly shout forth a
ew lines—not at all important ones—in a dreadfully loud voice.
But I had not much opportunity of listening to the speeches; for
LADY Ossian said that she had brought me there that we might have
a little quiet uninterrupted conversation. And, fixing her dark falcon
eyes on me, she asked, in a low distinct voice,
“Is it true that you are going to be married, my dear?”
I was naturally a . deal astonished at the question, but I assured
her ladyship that nobody had taken the trouble to obtain my consent,
at least, to any such arrangement,
“But you are engaged, Miss BRompton,” she said, with a still more
intense glance i. I felt that I was colouring under her starin
eyes; but I answered that nothing of the kind was the case. . But
was afraid to ask, in return, whose name she had coupled with mine.
“We are not speaking the mere language of the world,” she said,
almost severely. “I am to take your word that there is no marriage in
view for you.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 3
I tried to pluck up a little spirit, and to say something about endea-
vouring always to make a sincere answer to a proper question; but it was
difficult in that haughty presence, and mysentence was scarcely complete.
“I know,” she said, with a petrifying sort of smile, “that young
ladies, educated in the world's ways, see no harm in what are profanely
called, 1 believe, white lies, about such matters; but I do not imagine
that you would take such a liberty with me as to let me proceed upon

er language was growing so very mysterious, that my curiosity got
the better of my #. and I º in silence to hear what her
roceeding was going to be.
“What I am about to say to you, Miss BROMPTON, is strictly confi.
dential between us. That is distinctly understood **
“I have no secrets from papa, LADY OssiaN,” I answered; “and I
do not º: that you would advise a daughter to promise any con-
cealments from her father.” I know that F; this speech upon the
least little stilts; but I did feel rather out of temper with LADY
Ossian, for hinting that 1 might not mind telling stories.
“There is a discretion which does not imply secrecy, exactly,”
returned LADY Ossi AN–but not quite so severely as before—“an
rely upon yours. Now, you inform me that your hand is free. A
member of my family has authorised me to make proposals for it.”
“I am sure I am very much honoured,” I said, hardly knowing
whether Lought to laugh at this regal way of management.
“That is a mere phrase of compliment,” said LADY OssiaN ; “but
not altogether untrue. Of course we are all equal, in a certain sense,
being all of us wretched, unworthy, miserable creatures, and crawling
worms; but the Ossian and MERVYN families have two Dukes, and
four Marquises, in collateral branches, and a direct, unbroken pedigree
of a thousand years. Your father is—in worldly language, I mean—
an excellent man; but I believe his remotest ancestor was a bookseller
in St. Paul's Churchyard.”
“At a time when I .#." his contemporaries, the Ossians and
MERVyNs, were little qualified to make use of his wares,” I replied,
quite pertly; for who is going to have her ancestors insulted? I do
º: LADY Ossian was rather pleased with me for striking a blow
Ot LIlein.
I with much composure.
“Wery well, little girl,” she said, almost graciously, “only quite
wrong, as LADY MERVYN may hereafter find out in her husband's
family history.”
“LADY MERVYN l’” I repeated. “I did not know.”—
“I am speaking of yourself,” she said, “My nephew, SIR FINGA,
MERVYN, with whom you are well acquainted, proposes to confer that
title on you.”
The little British Grenadier had actually sent his aunt to make a
declaration for him. I thought of him as he appeared on the Derby
Day, with his hat full of the spoils of the knock-em-downs; and 1 could
not help laughing at his employing an ambassadress to me. . .
“SIR FINGAſ,” I said, “has never given me the slightest idea that
I was to be so honoured.”
“Had he done so,” replied LADY Ossian, “any expectations he may
entertain from my favour would have been at an end. . Members of
our family are not in the habit of what is called Courtship. But after
your reply, you will receive all due attentions from SIR FINGAL
MERVYN.”
“Does your ladyship wish for that reply on the instant?” I asked
“It would, º appear more respectful if
some delay—”
LADY Ossian glanced very keenly at me; but I suppose she could
not conceive the P. j. of any answer but one being given; an
she begged that I would communicate with her at my own time. I
wonder what she would have said if she had known that, during her
stately sentence, I could not help thinking that I ought to return to
her the wooden lemon SIR FINGAL had given me at Epsom. She
pressed my hand with a very firm grip, and dropped the subject. And
at this moment the great meeting burst into the loudest laughter, the
oratorial undertaker having made a most successful joke about the
Pope's Eye on a leg of Protestant mutton. LADY Ossian took ad-
yantage of the renewed applause (led by the Honour ABLE MR.
CRowsFoot, who actually cried “Bravo!”) to leave the hall. She took
me home, and I suppose I need not say more about the answer papa
wrote her that afternoon, than that it did not justify the British
Grenadier in hoping that VioleT BROMPTON Wººd ever sign herself

contended as eagerly as ever for the temporary possession of the property -
the accumulation of a thorough poultice of
good “loamy soil” on the cheeks of one or two of them. Though the ascent of
an “intrepid aeronaut” had been announced, the weather might have been a
sufficient excuse for keeping him on terra firma—we cannot say dry land-but
MR. BATTY, with his usual eagerness to keep faith with the public, had made all the
arrangements for doing so.
Accordingly, there was a large, partially-inflated balloon, lying in soak in the centre
of the ground, and gradually—to the surprise of every one-assuming an appearance
of swelling out, as if it was anxious to give the public, in due time, full satisfaction.
Great was our astonishment when we saw the attendants proceeding to affix the
car, and the “intrepid aeronaut” skipped as lightly as he could through the
mud, which, trodden as it had just been º, the Roman steeds, was, to, our classical
minds, suggestive of the Pontine Marshes. The balloon, after showing an eccentric
disposition to stand upon its head, to lie down on its side, and roll over on its own
axis, was at length suffered to go, and ascended majestically into the air, serving
as a convenient umbrella for the “intrepid,” who continued fluttering a flag in
the cold damp air as long as he was visible. We sincerely trust that the week gone
by is the last of that succession of moist evenings, which have given terrible reality
to MR. BATTY's boast of “Continued Overflows.”

NEW MODF OF ADDRESSING THE INDE-
PENDENT ELECTORS.
MR. PUNCH, desirous of promoting the cause of out-spoken honesty
all over the country, begs to submit a Model Address, which he takes
leave to say will be found to suit many a candidate. It will be seen
that it is composed on a new principle. The new principle is a simple
one; it amounts to a simple out-pouring of the candidate's heart, and
to an entire candour of communication on his part with his enlightened
constituency in futuro. It is supposed to be written by a youn
gentleman who proposes to support LoRD DeRBy through “thick an
thin’—the “thick” predominating in the upper regions.
“GENTLEMEN,
“I beg to offer *: as a candidate for the representation of
your city in Parliament. mean to go through the bore of what is
called ‘canvassing’ you at an early period. The weather is confoundedly
disagreeable for that kind of thing just now, but I suppose one must go
through with it. Jones, our lawyer, I hope, will put things in train
for me, so that I shan’t have more actual contact with your enlightened
persons than I can help.. I know it will be just a repetition of the same
thing over and over again; and that I shall, perhaps, have to take a
; d deal of bad sherry at the Drawlington Arms before the dreary
usiness is over.
“The honour [by Jovel] which I am soliciting has been frequently
conferred on my family, and a pretty nuisance I dare say they found it.
We have interchanged offices of friendship with you for generations.
We get what we require from your shops, and so on; we live a goo
many weeks of autumn and winter in your neighbourhood; we
subscribe to your civic institutions; and, in fact, we always have your
happiness at heart-do you understand that? Your welfare is a dear
object to us—which is the regular good old phrase.
“My * are well known to you; so my governor says, at all
events. I am a strict supporter of the administration of Lord DERby.
In fact, who the deuce else can I support? . We have always been at
lº. drawn with the Whigs; and, by-the-bye, we have not forgotten,
. ne fellows, how you threw us overboard after the Reform Bill,
when you brought in a violent dog from somewhere near Smithfield,
whose name had never been heard in the county. I say I support
LoRD DERBY, for I suppose he and his people must be Conservative
at heart, if anybody is. Though, I give you my honour, I don't see at
this moment what he’d do that the Russell people would not. What
they mean by the way in which they talk about Protection I really
can’t understand. They’re going to do something for us, I suppose.
I imagine they'll try something, at all events. And, of course, they
won't neglect their supporters—the ſellows who go the whole hog in
their cause at this crisis. -
“I am a stern supporter of the British Constitution, whatever that
sublime abstraction may be, and a faithful son of the Church of
England, in which my two younger brothers have seven livings between
them. The prosperity of all classes is a fine comfortable sentence, and
I go in for that likewise. I don't want the Malt Tax abolished, parti-
cularly, myself; but I shall support the measure, of course, if everybody
makes such a row about it that DERby and BEN think it right to take
it off. I think extending the suffrage great humbug; but I will make
no opposition to it on class grounds—if you know, affairs take such a
turn that we must do it, or go out. I shall always be found at my post
—particularly if I get a lordship in the Treasury—and I will faithfully
attend to your interests, for they are sure to send up to the Club if
they want me particularly for a divisiºn. - -

In a State of Speechless Astonishment.
We think our present Ministers have been rather harshly blamed
for not speaking out more than they have done. The reason of their
silence is obvious enough. The outcry against Protection has been
so tremendous from all parts of the country, that it has had the effect
of completely dumbfounding them.

GOLDEN DREAMS.
somE minds, perhaps, the
golden legends which consti-
tute the news from Australia
may be interesting; but it is
probable that the discovery of
the precious metal at the An-
tipodes will lead to a diminu-
tion of interest. Indeed, it is
to be apprehended that gold
will cease to be precious in
quality, and be precious only
in quantity, to such an extent
that a number of sovereigns
will no longer be capable of
being considered tantamount
to so much tin. It will be
necessary to make jewels the
media of exchange; and then
we shall be sending for change
for a diamond, which will be
given in emeralds and rubies.
might be found in platinum,
which is scarce; the only ob-
jection to it is that the word
has no legitimate rhyme, and
would be unsuited for the use
of poets, or rather for their
abuse: for most of them decry
and vilify gold, although, like
other people, they are glad to get as much of it as they can.
“OUR CRITIC " AMONG THE PICTURES.
SOMETHING ABOUT SOME PORTRAITS AND LANDSCAPES.
WITH your permission, dear reader, we will leave these interiors
with their bric-à-brac” draperies, and lay-figures in silk velvet an
brocade, and these acres of stark staring portraiture. How °W.
sive they are, these portraits It is hard to say whether the West-
End or the East-End contributions are the most wearisome. One
feels as tired of the eternal wishy-washy flood of dainty ladies, and
large-eyed languishing misses, and stalwart life-guardsmen, and serious
statesmen, as of the awful outbreak of municipal and civic dignitaries,
who this year appear more red in face, more determined in attitudes,
rounder as to leg, more splendid in regard to red curtains, and more
.." in point of maces and inkstands, than I ever remember them
Ore.
And yet flat, stale, and unprofitable as these huge portrait-canvasses
are, they profess to represent men and women. But I don't know how
it is, there is something in the face of BLOGG of STOKE Pogls which I
cannot find in this gorgeous full-length of him, to be presented, as I
learn from the catalogue, “by his grateful fellow-townsmen,” in honour
of his exertions in procuring for the town that valuable pump, which
the artist would have done well to represent in the background
of that wild landscape, in the midst of which Blogg would be bored to
extinction, as he would certainly catch his death of cold through that
i. aperture at the back of the vast apartment in which he is
standing.
M'GILP, who is annoyed at the way I talk about the Exhibition
i..', points out to me that this is an idealised portrait, and that
Logg has just as much right to be idealised as ByRoN or BEEThoven
whenever he becomes a subject for the artist. I quite admit it. But f
respectfully contend that this is not the right sort of idealising treat-
ment to submit our. Bloggs to. Idealising is not sticking a vulgar
likeness of the man, in his most vulgar aspect, into the midst of cir-
cumstances and accessories in no way appropriate to him. If the painter
will catch me that in BLOGG's face, which makes him Blogg rather
than SLOGG or Mogg—if he will give me the character of the man in
his features, as BLogg himself unconsciously does, even when he flatters
himself he is most unlike the Blogg of every day—then he has given me
the idea of BLogg—he has given me something which, though at no
single moment. Imay see it in Blogg's face, is yet the impression
which the habitual contemplation of Biogg's face (which fam'doomed
to see much oftener than I like) leaves behind it.
any idealising of Blogg beyond this.
means that the painter ought to make him more noble, less coarse,
less evidently a money-grubbing, hard-headed, rough-spoken, not over-
scrupulous, but on the whole kindly-disposed and shrewd burgess
and chief-magistrate of Stoke-Pogis, then I object to idealisation in
I cannot admit of
A metallic substitute for gold|fin

If by idealising him M'GILP||
this sense, altogether. . It is the striving after idealisation of this
fashion which begets vulgarity. And it is to the idealising painter of
this kidney, much more than to the homest citizens his sitters, that we
owe the intense snobbishness of most portraits of this class.
Whoever saw a Dutch Burgher of REMBRANDT’s whom he could
set down for a snob P. And yet, his originals were not a bit more ideal
beings than the Bloggs of our own day. As to costume, they owe
...; to that in general. The dignity, impressiveness, truth, and
force of these heads, is due to the painter; and a portrait-painter, with
the qualities of a REMBRANDT, would find Burgomaster Sixes enough
in our own time, and under our common-place broadcloth.
Everything that I have said of the gentlemen is true of the ladies, as
I hope to show hereafter. But I have not time to dwell longer on
portraits just now. I would merely say, en passant, that I could have
found examples in the present Exhibition, of the rules to be followed
in this branch of the art, as of the faults to be avoided.
MR. KNIGHT's portrait of an old academy servant, Mr. Waughan—
WATson GoRDON's honest and straightforward presentment of that
determined Scotchman, sitting, hat in hand, over MR. WAUGHAN's
head–BoxALL's portraits, almost without an exception—WEstcott's
Rector Campbell—S. LAwkENCE's head of Henry Taylor—and WATTs's
marvellous chalk drawing of Lord John Russell—are noble works, in
which the character of the sitter is given, to the exclusion of all that is
idle, or inappropriate, or distracting, or vulgarly genteel, or snobbishly
e, or conventionally picturesque.
But let me pass from portraits into the open air. Oh, nature, that
cannot be dressed up in the velvets of the Louis QUAtoRze time, or
the brocades of GEORGE THE Second Landscape painters at least
should be true, and unconventional; and yet, it is strange to see how
almost º man of them will insist on putting nature into his livery.
Infinite as her aspects are, from the pearly cool of early morning,
through all the gradations of hot noon, j limpid eventide, to the
solemn twilight, when the gaunt trees stand up blackly against the
clear horizon—wide as the range would seem to be, from the spring
childhood of the year to its winter old age—vast as the accessible
world has grown in these days of railways and steam-boats—how we see
each single artist contenting himself with his own little batch of effects,
*PWº: year after year in his own little corner of the world.
Why is it that to MR. LINNELL, master as he is of his own scale of
subjects and colours, the earth will be always marly gravel, the horizon
clouds always cumulous * Does he look on the world through a pair
of coloured spectacles, which invest all objects with unvarying hues,
or have all his labour and love availed to give him a mastery only over
one of the many millions of nature's secrets? -
So, why—whether it be a Norfolk mill, overlooking the wintry broad
or a Highland loch, rippling under the white moon, or a twilight road
through a quiet village—why, in texture and in tone, is the face of
MR. CREswick's out-of-door nature ever one and the same *
I go into the woods and fields, and I see a world—like a fair and
ingenuous visage capable of all expressions—whose aspect varies with
every smile or frown of the sky, every flaw of wind, every blink of sun
or gloom of shadow—which passes with every passing hour, from one
look to another, which reflects every mood of mind, and is by turns
attuned to every key of sentiment. I walk into the Exhibition, and I
see, year after year, the same subjects, painted by the same men, un-
varying, bearing no impress of any feeling in particular, and answering
to no mood of mind. Am I to conclude that painters' skill, even the
highest, is unequal to the understanding and reproducing of more than
one of these fleetin º: of calm and storm, of beauty and awful-
ness, of joy and sadness, of love and wrath? Or is it that the painter
aving acquired one of the many harmonies that are ever resounding in
the visible world, keeps, for very love or laziness harping on the same
string till the end of his painting days P
Wº: the cause may be, it seems to me that our landscape-
painters go on repeating themselves, and not improving in the
repetition. Else, why is it that Highland lochs, and Highland hills,
and Devonshire moors, and Devonshire lanes, and Devonshire ferries,
have become so stale, flat, and unprofitable in the hands of MR. LEE?
Is it. that he paints them more feebly, or that we are sick of the
repetition? Or is it that he has fallen into the trick of it, and gives us
no longer a sharp, clear, proof impression of the first taking off, but
* toy y, ragged, and indistinct engraving from a worn-out old
p ate :
In short, of all the hundreds of landscapes here, there are few that
have power to catch the eye and arrest it; still ſewer that will repay
close and careful examination. Of pictures, as of other things, it is
often true that
“You must love them—'ere to you
They will seem worthy of your love.”
But there are few of these landscapes that can beget the preliminary
ove which is indispensable to found a reason for itself. For me, in
fact, there are three landscapes in the Exhibition this year: and they
are MR. REDGRAve's Woodland Mirror; MR. Anthony's Ferns and
Beech-trees; and the back-ground of MR. HUNT's Hireling Shepherd.
I will leave you to meditate upon the list till next week.

N the º age, when the philosophical and no less beneficent
principles of Assurance are brought to bear upon almost every social
interest, it has long been a matter of silent regret that individuals
either destined by constitutional vivacity, or betrayed by unforeseen
accident into the commission of Personal Assault, should not surround
themselves with the Protective Influence of Association.
Almost every other casualty is provided with pecuniary remedy; or,
at least, pecuniary consolation. Your house is burned, and the
Phoenix crows-claps his wings—and the house again becomes bran
new from the ashes. Your ribs are broken on the railway; what then?
You have previously dropped }*. twopence or fourpence, as prudence
or purse may have admonished, and your ribs are paid for.
A man insures, his life, or limb-why not his temper? He may
anticipate a remedy for º we will say, his own nose smashed;
why not, then, a guarantee, if hastily betrayed to smash the nose of his
neighbour?
. The attentive reader of the Police Reports, must have been frequently
#y. with magisterial sentences on individuals convicted of assault.
“Being unable to pay the fine—[40s, or £5, as the injury dealt may
*:::::: prisoner was conveyed to I. in the police van.” -
eing, we trust, conscientious advocates, of order; vivaciously alive
to the importance of money as a standard of morals and feelings in
this, our peculiarly commercial country, we–the Projectors of Every
MAN HIs own BRUTE, &c.—call the attention of the humbler classes of
society, and especially claim the consideration of Husbands addicted to
the Personal Chastisement of Wives, to the principles of the above
Association, whose object it is to guarantee every insurer—at the least
possible scale of payment-from the inconvenience, and the ignominy
of incarceration—enabling him to pay the fine ; and thus, assaults being rufi
a matter of money, to be permitted the enjoyment of his ferocity of
will, whether exercised upon his wife or his neighbour.
But one example is worth a hundred assumptions. At once we
take a case, decided lately at Worship Street. A man named
FREDERick LABorde is charged, in the strong language of the
reporter, with “a murderous attack upon his wife, and also with having
violently assaulted a married woman, named Wood.” MR, LABorde
had previously given the wife of his bosom “a violent blow on the
eye:” after which—
* He then caught up a ponderous wooden mallet, which he was in the habit of using
in his trade, and brandishing it over his head, brought it down with all his force upon
her pºse, which caused the blood to gush down over her dress, and felled her to the
floor.”
The lodgers interfered, when MR. LABORDE attacked them all indis-
criminately, beating one, however, “unmercifully.” Well, the Magis-
trate—understand, the Magistrate, can only dispense the law-
“MR. HAMMr LL ordered the prisoner to pay a penalty of £5, or to be committed for
two months to the House of Correction, for assaulting his wife; in addition to which
he must pay a second fine of £5 for the other assault, or undergo a ſurther term of two
months' imprisonment.”
MR. LABorde, not having the £5, was committed. Had he been a
man of means, he might have broken his wife's nose, or the nose of any
other woman at his pleasure, paying for the enjoyment; but the poor
fellow had not the money, when the relentless law consigned him to
the discomfort of a gaol.
Now, it is here, where the agency of our Association—that of EveRY
MAN His Own BRUTE—proposes to assert itself. Why, we ask, assault
being a matter of money-bruises, contusions, smashed noses, scattered
teeth, being purchaseable—why should not the poor man be enabled to
pay for them; why should he be sent to prison, not for the assault—let
that always be borne in mind—but for not being able to pay for the
assault P
The law may change, but so long as the law permits a man to well-
nigh murder his wife—to fell her with a mallet to the earth, as abutcher
knocks down a bullock—so long does the poor ruffian, the indigent
rascal, the penniless brute and coward suffer injustice; for he is
F. not for what he does, but for being too poor to pay for what
e does. For instance, is it not clear, that could MR. FREDERIck
LABohde have laid down the £5 for the work of his mallet upon his
wife's nose, he might by this time have had another £5 worth of mis-
chief upon some other member of her person? Now this distinction
bears with unjust severity upon the poor, who cannot afford to be
ans.
Therefore the projectors of the above Association, made confident by
the very nicest calculations, are enabled, at a very trifling outlay, to
insure the commission of brutality in every variety.
At about twopence a week, a man may insure himself for ten pounds'
worth of assaults per annum. For only twopence a week, and any
ruffian may smash his wife's nose twice in a year; or otherwise beat, and
ill-treat her, spreading two principal assaults over six or eight little
ones. He gives his wife one or two black eyes. He is fined 10s. The
RUFFIAN's PRovident Association lays down the money; and, the
discharged and triumphant ruffian having, like an honest man, paid for
the mischief, spotless as an ermine, leaves the Court. -
Further particulars will be duly, announced. In the meanwhile,
prospectuses are to be had at every Police Office.

decisions of the WICE and the Lord CHANCELLOR. It is a remarkable
fact that an insignificant cause can produce a serious effect, as we
have seen in the instance of the "... Johan NAH, who has done
more mischief by doing nothing, than she would in all probability have
done good, if she had faithfully kept to her engagement.
“There's not a charm the world can give
Like that it takes away,”
says the poet, and there is certainly not a house a prima donna can
bring like those she keeps away, when she enters into a contract which
sets the town, on the qui vive, and then abstains from ſulfilling her
agreement. The “fair deceiver” has injured the season at both
establishments, when she might have made the fortune of one without
ruining the other. But as it is—

Seeing JENNY, LIND has come to town, she has now an opportunity
of doing a really graceful act, by retrieving the fortunes of an establish-
ment where her own fortune was most deservedly realised.
STREET PERFORMERS AND “ CRUSHERS.”
YesterDAY a deputation of tumblers, jugglers, and gymnastic per-
formers, accustomed to exhibit their tricks and feats of strength and
agility in the public thoroughfares, waited upon Mr. Punch at his official
residence in Fleet Street, to express the alarm and apprehension in
regard to the liberties of the j created in their minds by the
recent Proclamation prohibiting Romish monks and other ecclesiastics
from wearing the costumes of their respective orders, displaying their
symbols, and celebrating their rites and ceremonies, in the streets. The
deputation was headed by SIGNOR SMITHERINI and PRofessor MoRRIs,
º: it having been informally introduced to Mr. Punch by the official
Oy,
PROFEssoR MoRRIs said he begged Mr. Punch's pardon, and hoped
he'd txcuse him for having taken the liberty of troublin of him to ax
him the º whether that there Proclamation agin the papish
monks and friars was anyways liable to interfere with that respectable
interest as he had the honour to represent He was afeard it would.
Stop one sort of show in the streets, and why not stop another? Say
black gowns ain't to be wore there, and it may as well be said, you
shan't wear spangled frocks neither. It was a dangerous principle to
hinder anybody from dressing according to his fancy. To be sure he
didn't cut sich a figure as the papishes. He wasn't so likely to frighten
the horses. [The PRofessor was attired in tight fleshings and white
buskins, with a blue fillet round his head.] He hoped he was not quite
sich a object as them Romanish Guys.
Mr. Punch said the PROFEssor's costume was more like that of the
ancient Greeks than that of the modern Romans.
The ProFEssoR did not know much about that. Speakin of them
Roman-candlestick priests, people said sich mountebanks ought to be
put down, and it was this talk about puttin down mountebanks as made
him uncomfortable.
Mr. Punch, said that such anxiety on the PROFEssoR’s part was
natural, but that he (PROFEssoR MoRRIs) might make himself tolerably
easy. The Proclamation—which, by the way, he could not help some.
what suspecting to have been advised by Ministers with electioneering
views—affected only one class of mountebanks. As long as the
PROFEssoR and his order abstained from constituting themselves a
nuisance, by performing, in fashionable or crowded streets, obtruding
themselves on notice where they gave offence, collecting a mob, or
acting any foolery calculattd to provoke a breach of the peace, they
would, doubtless, be free to vault, tumble, dance, stand on their heads,

or each other's shoulders, without, much, molestation. They did not go about masquerading in the
interest of a Foreign Power. They had only one objectionable point in common with the Oratorians and
Passionists—a slight tendency to squalor, easily to be corrected by occasional recourse to soap and water.
He (Mr. Punch) should nevertheless think it might be well for them to keep out of the way of their
black friends, lest such company should attract the attention ºf the police. -
Signon. SMITHERINI stated that his performances, as Illusionist and Wizard, were sometimes
accompanied by cymbals, which he understood was forbid in the Proclamation;, was that true?
Mr. Punch explained the difference between the musical instruments alluded to by the Signon, and
the prohibited symbols. The Signor's vocation was in small jeopardy. Though the parties aimed at in
the Proclamation were famous for their illusions, they could not properly be termed conjurors. He
(Mr. Panch) perhaps, however, might recommend SIGNon SMITHERINI to call himself, in plain English,
MR. Saitºrs. SIGNOR was a foreign title, and might suggest that the bearer of it was a Jesuit in
disguise. This would be unlikely; and probably MR, SMITHERs, might repair to Court—or Alley—
without getting himself into any serious scrape, although he should put on his most remarkable
Wizard's dress, and announce himself as not only Signon, but Monsignoke.
The deputation then withdrew, followed by the boy, and a number of other boys.

RELIGION FOR THE HIGHER CIRCLES.
An advertisement in the Times apprises us of the fact that there is a society established, having for its
ºxcessively genteel purpose, the conversion of the higher circles. An article has been prepared by a
tract society, which is strongly recommended for fashionable use; and which, of course, is not
intended for the mere vulgar votaries of Christianity. We have not met with any of the publications
in question, our office being possibly too far east for the elegant efforts of the religious exquisites,
whose labours are no doubt bounded on the east by Pall Mall, on the south by Spring Gardens, on the
north by Grosvenor Square, and on the west by the limits of Belgravia. - -
We always had an idea that religion knew no distinction of ranks; we know that Christianity
repudiates anything like class divisions among its own followers, as far as religion is concerned; but ||
there appears to be a fashionable sect which, refusing to hear of pious partenus, looks upon “elect”
and “select” as synonymous. We shall not be surprised at any affectation or absurdity in the much
abused name of religion after this, nor should we be astonished at finding announcements of a

JUST THE TERM FOR IT.
THE French do not take an oath,
they only lend it. Their term is,
“preter serment.” This practice of
lending is extremely convenient. The
oath is “lent” for a certain period,
and then when the person is tired of
the loan, he calls for it back again.
It was never given, and, accordingly,
is still the property of the person who
“lent” it, for him to do with it what-
ever he likes. Or else it shares the fate
of all things that are lent, and nothing
is ever seen or heard of it afterwards.
It is as good as lost. This has been
the fate of all oaths in France, through
its various eras of monarchy, repub-
licanism, empire, and provisional go-
vernments; and we do not mind
making a wager, anywhere but at a
betting-office, that it will be the fate
again of all the oaths that have been
“lent” to Louis NApoleon. It

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 11
A PROSE CANTICLE.
OST, certainly, the proper
mode of spending the Sunday
for inhabitants of towns, ex-
cept those who keep carriages
and can be driven into the
country by their own servants,
attending divine service by
the way, with their coach-
man and footmen waiting
for them outside, is to go
to church three times a day,
and occupy the intervals in
reading sermons strictly or-
thodox, or perhaps devoting
an hour or so to a very slow
walk through the streets.
But as there are unfortunately
multitudes who will not even
go to church, yet who will
go somewhere, is it not much
better that they should pass
their time at the public-house
than at such a place as the
Crystal Palace?
Those who might resort to
the public-house would drink
gin and beer; beverages not
unwholesome in moderation,
but they that should visit
the Crystal Palace or the
- - - - British Museum—were it
open on Sundays—would imbibe the poison of secular knowledge unqualified by theological
Cpl.nlon.
Excess in gin and beer-nay, even in, Port wine—will make a man drunk : no doubt
drunkenness is a sin; but when it is caused by alcohol and malt liquor, and particularly when it
results from a mixture of both, it is pretty sure to be followed by repentance the next
morning, or at least by a headache calculated to teach the sufferer the hollowness of
worldly º:
But the elevation produced by contemplating the works of nature and art, is succeeded
by no salutary depression; on the contrary, the amusement of the day so spent is generally
felt to bear the morrow's reflection, and thus begets a soul-destroying complacency, instead
of the wholesome conviction of being a miserable sinner.
And then the man who gets drunk contributes to the Excise, and his transgression tends
to increase the revenue, and thus to place, at the disposal of the Government, funds which
a pious Ministry might apply to the improvement of bishops' palaces. Whereas the mere
mental intoxication caused by the sublime and beautiful, does not conduce to the enrichment
of the State or the Church, by one halfpenny.
Any attraction likely to draw town's-people into the country on Sundays is objectionable.
In the sunshine, beneath the blue vault of heaven, amid green fields and sweet flowers,
singing-birds, humming bees, silver brooks, corrupt human nature is apt to forget itself,
and mistake this wicked world for a F. Now, those who are obliged to remain in cities
are surrounded by circumstances all forcibly impressing them with a sense of their misery
and mortality. The sewers and gutters in their paths—emblems of depravity—exhale a moral
with a stench, and teach the heart a lesson through the nose. From crowded churchyards
the fact of death is brought home to them in the very air they breathe and the water they
drink–if they can drink such water: truth, humiliating, but salutary, if not wholesome truth,
lies at the bottom of all the adjacent wells. The knell accords with the reek of the intramural
graveyard; the one corroborates the other; they tell the same story, The incense of the
flowers contradicts the knell. The rural influences go altogether to inspire affections and
º just contrary to the º: º the becoming despondency, the consciousness of
walking in a vale of tears, in the valley of the Shadow of Death; the mournful and melancholy
state of mind, which, when it does not quite amount to despair and insanity, may be described
as a sanctified seriousness.
At least, if the Crystal Palace is not to be closed on the Sabbath, publicans and
brewers ought to be compensated for the loss of business, which they will sustain;
and if compensation is allowed them, it must be granted to the clergy; as the seduction
will affect the Church equally with the pothouse. It is likely to affect the Church in a
very peculiar manner.
There are in cities numbers of persons, who, impressed a little too strongly by the perception
of human wretchedness—there may be too . of a good thing-come not to be quite so
sure as they ought of the benevolence, justice, and wisdom, presiding over the universe. It
is the business of the clergy to convince and persuade them of the truths they cannot very
well see in the things about them. The priesthood have a vested interest in their doubts.
But the Crystal Palace—like the British Museum—will contain wonders of creation, demon-
strating those grand fundamentals which, a preacher can only argue. People will, in effect,
be º: there to church; and who knows but that some heterodox wretch might even propose
to have services, in the spirit of the Bridgewater treatises, actually celebrated in the
building, amidst objects which would certainly afford the strongest evidences of the principles
asserted in those volumes P

But still, on earth it is our fate,
That even “Children must be paid ſor.”

It is a beauteous sight to see,

We feel that “Children must be paid for.”

A charm that reaches every heart,

But if we hear a sudden crash,
No explanation need be stay’d for,
We know there’s something gone to smash;
We feel that “Children must be paid for.”
How exquisite the infant's grace,
When, clambering upon the knee,
The cherub, smiling, takes his place
Upon his mother's lap at tea ;
Perchance the beverage flows o'er,
And leaves a stain there is no aid for,
On carpet, dress, or chair. Once more
We feel that “Children must be paid for.”
Presiding at the festive board,
With many faces laughing round,
Dull melancholy is ignored
While mirth and jollity abound

pose when the veteran finally retires from the air
he will feel somewhat out of his element; but we
have no doubt that after living so long upon air
he has got together something more substantial
to enable him to enjoy the remainder of his ex-

five hundred ascents, so that he has been con-
tinually rising in the world, but has never been
puffed up, nor allowed himself to be inflated by

CHAPTER XI.
If ever anybody had no right to make an offer to another person,
that was the position of MR. WERDIGRIs, the antiquary, as regarded
me. For I always, liked him, and derived a great deal of instruction
from his conversation; and to add to his ingratitude, I may mention
that it was entirely owing to my cutting out an advertisement, and
enclosing it to papa, that the latter bought a little cabinet of coins of
the Lower Empire, and presented it to MR. WERDIGRIs on his fiftieth
birthday. And then his dear old sister, WIRTY VERDIGRIs, had become
fonder of me than of any body in the world, except of her brother, and
we were going on so pleasantly, till it occurred to him to alter our
sitions. I cannot think what put such nonsense into his head. I
lad about as much expectation of a proposal from his statue of
PHocION.
He lives at Brighton, and while we were staying there we used to go
to his house a good deal. ...Whenever, he got a new old coin, or relic of
any kind, he always sent WIRTY round to invite me to come and see it,
and the dear old creature, who knew nothing whatever about any-
thing except making everybody comfortable, invariably brought the
strangest messages. One day she was particularly anxious for me to
come, because Stacey—that is to say EustAcr—had just received some
Wooden Halfpence made by DEAN Swift the Draper, and another
time I was to go and see a piece of a bonnet dug up at Flodden
...?' as dear WIRTY said, what part of a bonnet a round bit of gold
could be, she could not guess. But she was just as pleased to see
STACEY happy in showing his collection, as if she could have called over
all the CAESARs as accurately as the CHANCELLOR of The ExchEQUER,
who tells us in his life of poor LoRD GeoRGE BETTING-Book that the
most solemn event in the history of Christianity took place in the reign of
AUGUSTUs. MR. VERDIGRIs is a delicate-looking person, with exceed-
ingly long white fingers, and nails which might easily be cut into pens.
He is very small, and pale, and mild, and nearly bald, having only a
thin fringe of grey hair round the centre of his head, which flushes up
to the very crown upon the least excitement. And he always wears a
long frock coat, buttoned up to the chin, where it meets a white cravat.
I suppose that he has plenty of money, for he is always buying
curiosities, and giving away charity, for he is one of the kindest-hearted
creatures in the world.
MR. VERDIGRIs had been ºff. collection, and sent WIRTY
to fetch me to see it in its new order. The work had occupied him for
some days, and he had obstinately repulsed all his sister’s offers of
assistance. “My dear,” she said, “while he was gone for a walk, I
stuck more of his coins and medals into those little holes than he had
done in two days; but when he came in he burst out laughing, and
turned all my work out, saying that I had introduced KING HERod to
an INNocent Pope, and there would be another massacre like that of
BART holomew Fair.” When I arrived, MR. VERDIGRIs himself did
the honours in a much more learned way, and begged me to accompany
him all round his little gallery, and see that he had put everything
into chronological order—from YoUNG MEMNoN to Louis NAPO-
LEON. Poor WIRTY followed us, and kept up a gentle fire of notes
upon the antiquary's text. Of course, I do not pretend to remember
a millionth part of what I was told, especially as laughing with WIRTY
interrupted my attention sadly. When her brother was shewing
me the Roman As, she ventured to suggest that the Roman must
have been one for giving such a name to a piece of money, but she
supposed an ass was coined for small bets, just as we say a poney for
larger ones. And among some ancient curiosities was a relic supposed
to having been used in making a philter, and this excited WIRTY's great
contempt, as she could not at all see how the water was to be passed
through it. And she really made a sort of joke over a brass mirror,
declaring that from all she had heard of the Roman ladies such a
looking-glass must have reflected them very faithfully. The dreadful
faces she made when her brother was describing the Roman practice of
bringing live mullet to table, that they might die upon the plates of the
epicures, were wonderful; but his mention that offending slaves were
thrown into the lamprey pond elicited a delightful piece of English
history from her.
“Ah!” she said, “that’s like what I read in HUME's history many
ears ago, about one of our kings, who was killed by lampreys, because,
it says, they did not agree with the Constitution. "I forget which king
it was, Stephen I think, but the moral is the same.”
“In that case, HENRY THE FIRST will do, WIRTUE dear!” said
MR. VERDIGRIs quietly.
“I dare say that was the man,” answered WIRTY. “To be sure it
couldn’t be STEPHEN, for he was stoned. . I have seen the picture of it
in that church in Walbrook that went into Chancery with the Lord
MAYor, and got dilapidated.”
“They teach young ladies better now than they did in your time, my
dear old WIRTY,” said MR. WERDIGRIs. “Here is $. WIolet
BROMPTON could tell you the names, dates, and characters of every one
of the sovereigns of Europe, from CharleMAGNE’s time.
“Indeed, you must give me credit for nothing of the kind,” I said,
“but I think if I were to study your collection of coins often, I might
be much better informed. They are the best helps to memory I
can imagine.”
To my surprise, as I said this, the face and head of MR. WERDIGRIs
flushed up into a uniform crimson. He looked at his sister with an
odd sort of smile, and said,
‘‘VIRTUE.”
“STAcEy,” she answered, with an equally significant look.
“Shall I say it,” he asked in quite a flutter.
“I should, STAcey,” replied MRs. WIRTY.
He turned to me, and his redness, which had slightly toned down,
took a new and more glowing tint as he did so. I could not conceive
what was the matter. He kept on smiling in a kindly, but an uncom-
fortable way, fidgetted with his hands, and even began to scratch with
his long nails on the glass of one of the medal cases.
i. }}} would like,” he stammered out, “to study these things very
often ?”
“Under your direction,” I said, and in their proper order here, I
think it would be very pleasant.” Now, I said this because it flashed
across my mind that he . perhaps be thinking of spoiling his
collection for the sake of making me a present, and this I would not
have let him do. But my answer was the most unfortunate one I
could have made. - - -
“Here, and under my direction, WIRTy,” he repeated, looking at
her with a face beaming with pleasure. *There could not be better
encouragement. That study you might undertake at all times you
pleased, Miss BROMpton,” he said, earnestly and respectfully. “I am
not a man of many words, and indeed I feel my deficiency, painfully,
when I wish to say what I would say now—but—you—you are above
affectation and coquetry—you have known me a long time, and WIRTY
loves you very much. Will you—will you accept all that you see here,
and, with it, its owner?”
I never said I was a heroine, and if I had, everybody would have
found me out long ago... But, supposing. I had asserted the slightest
pretensions to heroineship, they would all have been crushed for ever

when I came to this passage in my, history. I looked at him for a
moment to be quite sure I understood him, and then I looked at
VIRTY, and saw in her dear old face such a mixture of pleasure and
lºg that—there is no use in pretending that I did not—I began
o cry.
. I am not skilful at analysing my sensations, but here was a
kind, learned, gentlemanly man, whom I both respected and liked, and
who had suddenly placed me in a positiºn from which there was no
escaping without giving him pain. The situation was simple enough
and perhaps I was simple enough for crying over it, but I did cry, an
there is the truth. He looked very much distressed, and WIRTY came
up to me and took my hand. But I struggled for self-command, for I
would not leave these kind creatures in a moment’s doubt, and self.
command came. -
“Dear MR. VERD1GBIs,” I said, but not at all steadily, “pray forget
what you have said. You do me very great honour in thinking me
worthy of such a thing, and I do assure you I am very grateful to you.
But our ages are so different—I am quite a child, and you know I
know your birthday,”—and I tried to smile, and pointed to the silver
late on the cabinet we had given him—“and altogether it is quite
impossible... But do take my hands, and say you will not be angry with
me, and will go on giving me instruction.” For I could not bear to
ood
think of quarrelling with him. . . .
He looked at me very steadily for a minute or so, and then he said,
quietly, and almost sadly—
“Yes. There are .# ears between us, and they ought to have
taught me to know myse §. they have taught me how to value
you, or I should not have said what you have heard. Forget it; if
remember it, §§ shall never see that Ido. We will always be friends—
you and I, and WIRTY”—and he took a hand of each; “and—and—will
you come to see me to-morrow, and we will go through the Emperors—
I have very good coins of the Emperors.” And pressing our hands, he
walked quickly out of the room.
“You spoke quite right, dear,” said MRs. WIRTY, very kindly, and
wiping her eyes; for she, it seems, had followed my wise example.
“And that's the last word you'll ever hear about it, if you come here,
as I hope you will, a thousand times. And STACEY must keep to his
Roman asses, and his rows of nobles, and his pieces of bonnets, and his
Johnny groats, and all the rest of his tattermedallions.”

The Youngest Member in the House.
A LADY declares that if MR. Anstey were to remain in the House
of Commons all his life, he would still be the youngest member in it;
“for it is perfectly clear,” she says, alluding to his accustomed habit
of counting out the House, “that so long as he retains the faculty of
speech, he will never be able to reach forty.”
TAPPING A BEER BARREL FOR THE TRUTH.
| M.R. PEPPER has been lecturing at the Polytechnic upon the qualities
of the different beers of ALLsoPP, BAss, and SALT. It strikes us as
being a carious way of proving that these beers are not adulterated
when we actually have before us the admission that both PEPPER and
SALT are mixed up largely in their composition.
Corn Measure.
WE don't know what measure Messrs. DERby and DisrAELI may

SABBATARIAN TIT FOR TAT.
OW zealous some folks are for
the souls of their fellow crea-
tures | The folks particularly
alluded to in this remark are
great people: the ARCHBISHOP
of CANTERBURY, the Bishops
of LoNDON and WINCHESTER,
the EARL of HARRow BY, the
EARL or SHAFTESBURY, and
several gentlemen, “tootedious
to mention.” Is it not written
in the Times newspaper how
they, having formed themselves
into a deputation, “waited on
the RIGHT Honour ABLE THE
EARL or DERby at his official
residence at Downing Street, at
. 2 o'clock, in order to urge upon
his lordship the expediency of
adopting measures to prevent the Crystal Palace or its grounds being
opened to the public on Sundays?” What condescending solicitude on
the part of peers and prelates for the spiritual welfare of vulgar
cockneys, snips, snobs, mechanics, shopmen, and their womankind;
creatures that not only consume tea and shrimps, periwinkles, and
ginger beer, but also smoke pipes and penny Pickwicks. The people
must feel flattered that they are thus sympathised with, by the superior
classes; only perhaps they would rather the sympathy were shown
somehow otherwise than by excluding them from pure air and enjoyment
—in great tenderness for their immortal part, but with small conside-
ration for their perishable lungs. ----
Not to be ungrateful, however, let us, the million, the rabble, the
opulace, get up a deputation of our own, and wait on Lord DERBY at
}. Street, in order to urge upon his lordship the expediency of
adopting some measures to prevent, as far as possible, bishops' palaces,
and the nobility’s mansions, parks, and grounds, from being open, to
themselves on a Sunday. In this way we shall return the sanctifying
obligation to keep the Sabbath miserably. There will yet; however,
remain six days of amusement for them; so that, we shall still but
imperfectly repay their kindness in propósing to debar us from our
recreation on the only day when we have time for it.
On this pious and grateful errand then, let us go tº the EARL of
Derby, in our Sunday’s best, and wearing patent Sunday faces, with
our eyes turned up, and the corners of our mouths turned down-an
our tongues in our cheeks.
THE OLDEST ESTABLISHED PROPHET.
We have been told—but we hope it is not true—that MR. Gye
intends to put in the Era, Sunday Times, and all the Sunday sporting
papers, the following advertisement, which we think highly absurd and
perfectly unnecessary:-
-
THE ONLY ORIGINAL “ PROPHETE" is MARIO, and no mis-
take 1 His address is, as usual, the Royal Italian Opera House, where he will
always be happy to see his friends, with the tip in their hands. Due notice will be
given of the Prophète's next appearance. In the meantime his “Huguenot." Draw
(price only 7s.6d.) is the best of the season. Three cheers, boys, for MAR19, the
oldest established and first and best and only Original Prophète, who snaps his fingers

Recollections of the Latin Grammar.
A Country Gentleman, writing to the Directors of one of the
Railways about the bad management of their line, and more especially
about the lights having been removed from the carriages, condensed
his indignation at the conclusion into the following fulminating line :-

THE Act for the Enfranchisement for Copyholds, is-the Lort

not settle the question whether a dramatic translation is a Freehold or
a Copyhold.

expended much Hebraic eloquence against the future Crystal Palace at
Sydenham-(a Palace that, on the 1st of May, 1853, will reveal itself in
thousandfold glory, for Paxton, and Fox and HENDERson, and Owen
Jones have promised it)—we ask of LEvy, who seems to be an authority
—what is gammon?
MR, LAING spoke as to the independent election of future directors;
whereupon—
“MR. LEvy said, that was what he called gammon /*
. Surely, MR. Levy, gammon has a larger, a more comprehensive
significance. What then, in all its bearings, is gammon P
e believe that gammon is the very choicest bit of cured hog's
flesh, vulgarly known as bacon; but such, of course. is not MR. Levy's
lammon.
Is SIBTHORP gammon, or any part of gammon? We think so; for
MR, LAING, in a capital speech on the high, refining purposes of the
Crystal Palace, said there were, among its objectors, a “Sibthorpian
class;” for the gallant and hirsute Colonel (Member for Thistles, could
thistles return a Member)—
“Represented a great many persons out of doors, who were vastly uneasy lest this
shºuld prove to be an idea connected with the spirit of the age, with progress, and
with the elevation of the mass of the community; and those being things which they
did not like at all, they objected to the proposed plan."
Nevertheless, “gammon,” so pithily touched upon by Levy, has
another and a broader application. What can it be in its widest and at
its fullest? ... Oh, here it is!
Earls, and Bishops have waited upon the EARL OF DERBy—who
received them with overpowering condescension—praying him to adopt
measures to prevent the opening of the new Crystal Palace for the
People to the People on Sundays
So that, after the people have been to their devotions, they may not
walk in the Eden prepared for them by Paxton After they have said
their prayers, they may not contemplate God's goodness in his world

Surely this is it; yes, in this visit of Lords and Bishops for such a
narrow, ignorant, bigoted purpºse-in this we have in its intensest sig-
nificance, the meaning of “Gammonl" Yes: gammon, gammon:
though perhaps, not exactly MR. LEvy's gammon—nevertheless,

“OUR CRITIC * AMONG THE PICTURES.
In my visits to the Academy Exhibition Room, I often catch myself
asking this question, sometimes of myself, sometimes of MR. GILP, the
eminent painter, sometimes of SQUENch, the distinguished critic—
“what is a Painter.” One can understand what the painter was, in
the early schools, when religion demanded his chief service, when his
employers were priors, and cardinals, and Popes, or pious laymen anxious
to propitiate a saint, or record a mercy, or honour an ancestor, in the
family chapel. Painting in those times was a thriving and honourable
trade—the studio was called a shop—the master employed apprentices,
who ground his colours, cleaned his palette, swept the painting room,
and carried on, under the master's eye, all the elaborate processes, with
earths, and minerals, and oils, which the SIR EDw1Ns, or MR. Leslies
of that day rformed for themselves, WINsons and NEwTons and
Robertsons being unknown.
Well, in those days, there was no mistake about the painter. He
was a workman, just as much as the carpenter or mason. In fact, any
distinction of artist and workman was altogether unknown at that time.
The same hand that squared the beam, designed and carved the
intricate tracery or delicate foliage of boss and finial; the chisel that
dressed the stone of the arch, sculptured the angels who hold up the
corbeil from which it springs. }: would seem, after all—though
MR. GILP protests vehemently º: being put on the same footing as
a house-painter—that the world gained more from this arrangement
than the artist lost. It was to this that we owe the basilica and
the cathedrals, the Hotel de Wille and Rath-Haus, the palaces of Venice,
and all the marvellous blacksmiths' work, and carpenters' work, and
masons’ work, and armourers' work, and goldsmiths' work, of the
thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, in all the civilised
countries of Europe. Most of us have travelled and seen more or less
of the wonders of those times. For those who have not, are there
not Wardour Street, and the old curiosity shops?
All this came of Art treated as a handicraft.
I jº. most of the painters of those times went merrily and con-
tentedly about their business, without much, notion of their own dig.
nity, or the aesthetics of their calling. They would be men of all
dispositions and kidneys—the clever jolly dogs, facile and heedless, who
only thought of getting over the ground, and touching the ducats of the
rince, or prior, or abbot, who was their employer for the time
ing—the slow and conscientious hands—the }.
rolls of any craft. We may be sure the great geniuses were about as
rare then as now; and that few of the number who worked were im-
pressed in . particular way by the sublimity or beauty of the religious
subjects which the habits of the time confined them to. Still, when
there did come a painter with a nature which could rise to the height
of his common themes, he had his Heaven to soar in, or his Hell to sink
to. There was room for all the sweetness of motherly love that a
RAPHAEL or a GHIRLANDAIo could dream on to his canvas, for all
the grand horror wherewith an ORCAGNA or a Michael ANGELo
could fill the dwellings of the damned, or for all the brooding faith
of a FRA BEATO, in the work that these men had to do. There
were no Art - Unions in those days— no Royal Commissions of
the Fine Arts—no Academy dinners or Annual Exhibitions; in fact,
no R.A.'s, incredible as it may appear—no distinguished º,
to pay for picture-galleries, nor disinterested picture-dealers to
fill them with undoubted originals. The artist, as we have said,
was a workman—and his work was called for in churches and chapels
and Campo-Santos, and baptisteries, and town-halls, and in the council
- - - - eeble imitators—the
º thinkers—in short, the usual variety one might look for on the
s
chambers of rulers, and, more rarely, in the arcades of great men's
houses. But a picture hanging against a wall, as a moveable ornament
of a room, was unknown to those times. What pictures there were,
then, in private houses, were on the foot-boards of beds, or on the
outside of trunks and cupboards, or on the cases of musical instru-
ments, or in similar undignified places, put there, I suppose, to heighten
the value of what was in itself valuable, and to lend a grace and charm
to objects of household use.
Now-a-days we have changed all this. The painter, now, is an artist,
and would be very angry to be called or thought a workman. Mean-
while, the workman has ceased to be an artist. We have separated
the domains of the useful and the ornamental. Freestone owns no
kin with marble....House-painter, in fustian, takes off his brown paper
cap humbly to Historical-painter, with R.A. after his name, #.
with dukes, and .."; in the Morning Post among the j
guests at Buckin ham Palace. Painting is not in demand for churches
or chapels. Establishment taboos her, and Dissent looks upon her as
diabolical. Only poor half-and-half Puseyism ventures to coquet with
her, and now and then breaks out into an altar-piece, or a chancel arch
decoration, amidst much dread of sturdy Protestant church-wardens,
and disapproving Bishop. She is as much a stranger to palaces as to
churches. National council-halls have as yet been closed to her in this
country, though their doors are ajar at last. She has been reduced to
the dimensions of drawing-rooms, and confined within three-foot frames,
tººled out in ten-pound infinitesimal doses to Art-Union prize-
Olders.
And thus it has come about at last, that the devout and stately muse
of mediaeval Italy, amongst us, is fain, with a painted face and dwarfed
body, to hustle her way painfully into the Annual Exhibition of the
Royal Academy. She must eat, poor creature, and is glad to suit
herself for Baker Street dining rooms, and May Fair boudoirs, and
Belgravian drawing rooms; or, in her highest flight, for Bridgewater
and Grosvenor galleries. She no longer prompts our devotion, nor
inspires our recollection of the past, nor beautifies, the passages of our
common life; but she makes our respectable dining rooms still more
respectable, by perpetuating our host and hostess and their charming
family, and divides attention in our drawing rooms with the elegant
furniture, and splendid window-curtains, and gorgeous carpets—in
short, she makes a very comfortable livelihood, in the way of room-
furnishing to a considerable extent.
Our artists, in fact, have ceased to be workmen, if you will, but it is
by becoming upholsterers—ticklers of the eyes of the rich, ministerers
to the vanity of the vulgar, contributors to the gratification of the
ostentatious. They elbow one another, for room, on the walls of the
Exhibition; and, like impudent, ladies in other places, strive to attract
attention by the thickness of their rouge, and the brilliancy of their
colours—Non musa sed meretrir.
In this sad struggle for the poor function of pleasing John BULL's
eye, no wonder that painting has almost forgotten to ask itself whether
it might not yet, perchance, speak to his imagination, and stir his
mind. In the upholsterer's work the painter has acquired the
upholsterer's taste for fine fabrics and gay colours. He has looked at
life with a decorator's eye, till he has got to value nothing but what he
calls picturesque. The men and women round about him are unfit for
his purposes, except as the originals of portraits—for portraits pay.
But, for all else, he asks, helplessly, what is to be done with our
present unpicturesque costume And, thereupon, finding, that the
tailoring of the time is unfriendly, he turns away in disgust from the
time altogether, and plunges wildly into the reign of CHARLEs the
Second, and flours tº Fourteenth, and William and MARy,
where he can disport himself delightedly among brocades and velvets,
and gold lace, and peach-blossom coats, and blush-coloured stockings.
And all this while he flatters himself that Art is honoured, because R.A.'s
sit at great men's tables, and entertain Dukes at Academy dinners.
No, my dear MR. GILP. Art is more of a trade now, than it was when
RAPHAEL's studio had no other name than bottega-in English, shop; and
moreover,itisanemasculate and man-millinersort of a trade, instead of one
demanding strong brains, and a brave and believing heart. It is a trade
mainly conversant with miserable things and * { aims—with vanity,
and ostentation, and vulgarity, and sensuality, and frivolity-no longer
dealing with themes of prayer and praise, with the glories of beatitude,
or the horror of damnation, with the perpetuation of family dignities
and devotions, the recording of great events, the dignifying of public
and national, or the beautifying of private and individual life. ... It is a
trade in ornament, and its Academy is a shop, and its Exhibition, a
display of rival wares, in which the best hope and the sole aim of the
many is to catch the eye, of a customer; and he who “colours, most
highly, is sure to please.” MR. GILP interrupts me here, with indig-
nation, to ask if I think that this is the artist's fault?
My dear MR. GILP, I have never said it is, I do not think it is: , I
believe it to be all our faults—the critics', the buyers', the º:
the Government's. Oh! there are enough of us to bear the blame,
and we really need not quarrel about the distribution of it. Let
us rather think if there is any way to better matters. Suppose we
venture a hint or two next week.

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GRAND DEMONSTRATION OF PUBLIC FEELING IN THE BRITISH
MUSEUM.
V
- º
MR. Pusch MR. Punch! I have got such a bunch of ideas, from
my noddle I scarcely can free 'em,
And I tremble with fright, as I sit down to write what I saw t'other
might in the British Museum.
I had loiter'd till dark in that overcramm'dark, looking into each case
in the mighty collection,
And wearied with that, you know young Memnon's Statue, behind
it 1 sat, you must know, for reflection;..
On my elbow then sinking, so long I sat thinking, never heeding the
deepening shadow of gloom,
Not dreaming 'iwas late, or that every Curator had vanish'd, and left
... me alone in the room;
When, lo! with much clatter, the head of a Satyr, which I thought
was mosaic and mailed to the wall,
Seized a conch that hung near it, and ºf to clear it, with a blast
loud and drear it quite started the hall;
At a summons so stunning, pell-mell there came running all the
creatures whose features I'd marked in the day;
Mummies rush’d from their places, and close on their traces, birds and
beasts from their cases march'd forth in º
Cats, Bats, Scarabaei, Dogs, Frogs, and Uraei, all clustered with glee
round Osiris and HoRus; -
While Zeus and Poseidon contrived both to ride on the crupper and
neck of an Ichthyosaurus; - -
Layard's Bulls next advancing, and prancing, and dancing, so fill'd the
young MEMNoN with pious emotion,
That he cried, “Sure each shape is our much beloved APIs; let's hasten
and show the dear things our devotion.” -
Then kneeling before them, he stroye to adore them, while Thoth, who
of AMMon and Isis the scribe is, . - -
*Twixt the Bulls took his stand, with his Ibis in hand, well knowing
“in medio tutissimus ibis;”- -
And Aroſſo said, “Really! our beasts fatted freely, when Iserved in
the pastures and stalls of Anxietus; -
But if Bulls such as those e'er had enter'd our shows, I'd have laid
ten to one they would certainly beat us.” -
From the Elgin room crawling, and sprawling, and falling, such cripples
came bawling for help to each other:
Some, of arms quite bereft, with the limbs they had left bore the trunk
Time cleft from the legs of another;

And next, to surprise us, came young Dionysus, like St. Denis, his
, namesake, without any head;
While a Thºrus, deprived of his two feet, contrived on his stumps to
. , hop, WIDRington fashion, instead.
Thighs look'd after their calves; of a Torso the halves from opposite
., corners sought vainly to meet;
While a Head, in a funk, cried, “Oh! where is my trunk? Where can
it have slunk to without any feet?”
But at length, with much, patching, and sorting, and matching, they
..., were all of 'em join'd, save a Lap of Latona,
Which all helplessly lay, as advertisements say, of no use to any
excepting the owner. , .
From the upper rooms rushing, the larger beasts crushing, came,
most with a very disconsolate air,
Because the Mastodon their great toes had trodon, as they jostled
and push’d in the crowd on the stair:
And the poor Hippopotamus murmur'd "öd rot 'em,” as he walk’d
by the side of the large Polar Bear:
“They’ve christen’d me Zekoe—that's Cape Dutch for Sea Cow !”
and the great Irish Elk added, looking quite grave
"It's a shame thus to serve us; they’ve labell'd me Cervus, and all
the world knows that’s the Latin for slave!”
As I pass'd through the Hall, I could hear one and all making bitter
complaints of the places assign'd them.
The Colossi all swore they must break through the floor of the room
in which Fate and the Trustees ej them;
Here DIANA, complain'd that all day she was chained, vis-à-vis with
that fellow, ACTA:on; while WENUs
Said, “PARIs stands near me, sweet youth ! but, oh dear me ! they’ve
planted that frump, EpicuRUs, between us,
And * own little CUPID behind that great stupid Sarcophagus stands,
... looking mopish and dreary;
Quite hidden, poor fellow ! much like that puella, in VIRGIL, qua se
cupit ante videri.”
“Your griefs, I opine, ma'am, are nothing to mine,” said a Bison, who
near to her chanced to be standing:
"Oh! I pine and I sigh for the days long gone by, when I lived by
myself in a case on the landing;
I had room then, I ween, both to see and be seen; but they’ve
packed us so close in this classification,
That the Yac from Thibet will do nothing but fret, and the Brahminee
Bull is consumed with vexation;
While the Buffalo Cow her fear scarcely knows how to conceal, lest
the Aurochs, who’s stationed between us,
Should insert his fierce tusk in the sides of the Musk, or commence an
assault on the whole of his genus.”
As the Bison thus spoke, on a sudden there broke from the head of
RAMºses, just over the door,
(Though it's not got a chest), a strong voce di testa, such as opera
... critics ne'er dream'd of before; .
And it said, “My fine ſellers! the things in the cellars are soon to be
brought up the stairs to this floor;
There's an end to our glory, for soon, on each story, there’ll be just
room enough for our worthy Curators
To take care lest a Trustee find us damp or dusty; but there’ll not be
an inch of space left for spectators /*
As he ceased, such a loud wailing rang through the crowd, that I
started; and, lo! by the sun's ruddy gleam,
Through the windows, I knew I had jºš but yet you will allow
that it wasn't entirely a dream.
Queen's Bench.-Achilli v. Newman.
This trial º it was found necessary for public health
to fumigate the Court. The taint of friar's balsam, and smell of Roman!
candles, were most dreadful. All the walls were whitewashed, pounded
camphor strewn upon the floor, chloride of lime sluiced in abundance,
and every means adopted to render the place as clean as possible, after
the abominations brought into Court by Doctor Newman. We'regret
to hear that more than one juryman, of delicate constitution, is at
present suffering severely from the moral miasma arising from the
examination.

The MARQUIs or GRANBy said, in the Commons—“I represent, the
agricultural labourer!”. Punch has received, several letters from
agricultural labourers protesting against any such misrepresentation.
NEW HAN D BOOK FOR ITALY.
By the EARL OF MARMALADE.-Downing Street.
CCASIONALLY Punch throws himself into the
critical chair; and this is such a timely
work, and its distinguished author has of
late—whether fortunately or not for himself
we will not pause to inquire—challenged so
much of public attention, that his book has
become almost a national work. Let Mr.
MURRAY look to his scarlet covers; for the
noble EARL OF MARMALADE has here produced
a work that demands a place in every traveller’s
rtmanteau. - - -
The noble Earl has a very original notion of
the relative importance of Englishmen—or
rather their relative nothingness — to the
country, especially if the country be Italy, in
which they may travel or reside. Always con-
form to custom, is, evidently, the philosophy
of the noble writer. When in Greenland, eat
walrus and drink whale-oil—in fact, do as
Greenland does. The Earl, however, parti-
cularly advises young, Englishmen to take
anything that an Austrian officer may provide
them, whether, it be the flat of the sword or
the edge, with the most perfect stoicism.
“Let us suppose,” says the noble Earl,
addressing the young British traveller, “that
you are hustled, or even kicked off the trottoir
into the middle of the road by any soldier,
native or mercenary to the place; well, it is
the worst of ill-breeding to put yourself in a boxing-attitude, like an
low coalheaver, or anything of that sort, as though about to knoc
the soldier down; because soldiers are men of the highest and nicest
honour; especially Austrian soldiers: in Italy, the flies are not even
permitted to settle on them, No, my advice is to the young Englishman
to slack his temper, or quicken his pace.” - - - -
(To “slack a temper” is, assuredly, an odd phrase; but it is evident
that the noble Earl — the instances abound in his book—is above
common expression, making a language entirely for himself.)
The noble Earl continues. “If, however, the Englishman's blood
will rise when hustled, shoved, or kicked; and if, in an unguarded
moment, he begins to double his fists, and commences to square his
elbows,” (original, style again), “and has his skull cut through by
the officer's sword, that is not, according to regimental orders, to
be insulted; why then, the young, Englishman is to be open to an
apology, and any amount of money that his ambassador in the place, or
his Secretary for Foreign Affairs in England may think sufficient for him.
I am assuming,” writes the noble Earl, “that theſº. 1s
of a commercial character of mind, when money will be all that is neces-
sary. But I cannot hide it from my conviction that I have known
Englishmen, and am open to confess I should like to know them again
-for, such noble spirits save a great deal of trouble to a Foreign
Secretary—who, upon being cut down by an Austrian lieutenant
would, when able to leave the hospital, send the lieutenant a challenge,
and so, making the quarrel a matter of honour, blow the lieutenant’s
rains out; or, should the lieutenant be the better shot, take, the
penalty of the lieutenant's bullet. This was according to the good old
lan # thirty years ago. A man's honour is always safest in his own
: that is, much safer than in the hands of a Forei
I know it is not Christianlike to try to shoot a man; an
º: Secretary.
know that gentlemen in Tuscany—at least they were not thirty years
ago–s
yet, I don't
hould be, bound by fastidious notions of Christianity. This,
however, I will say: I advise no young Englishmen to sojourn–
especially, in Tuscany, and more especially in Florence, without hair-
triggers.” -
e have now, we hope, culled sufficiently from the book to do justice
to the full-blown reputation of the EARL of MARMALADE. The work
is dedicated in German to LIEUTENANT ForsthubER, of the Austrian
army, quartered at Florence. In conclusion we must observe, that no
traveller's portmanteau will be complete without the book and—
duelling pistols.
Quiddam Honorarium.
ONE of those troublesome fellows, commonly called, “Wags,” who
sometimes unconsciously hit the right nail on the head, was heard to
observe the other day, that the new practice of referring ºffairs of
honour to the lawyers is very suggestive of the old notion of “honour
among thieves.”

CUT HIM DOWN BE HIND 1
POLITICAL COURTSHIP.
The New York Tribune has lately been publishing an account of the proceedings of a Con-
vention of Women, of which society the object is to assert ſeminine rights: among others
the right of exercising the elective franchise.
If, among the free and independent constituencies of these dominions, were included the
wives and daughters of England, we should now, on this present eve of a general election, of
course have the candidates for parliamentary honours paying their political addresses to the
ladies; courting them for their plumpers; somewhat, perhaps, in the manner following:
“To the Beautiful and Accomplished Electresses of Blankshire.
“LADIEs, Emboldened by a reception in your drawing-rooms of the most flattering
character, may I beg to solicit your suffrages at the impending election?
“I trust, that my figure º personal appearance are not such as to render me at all
objectionable. - - ---
“My bitterest opponents will not venture to deny that I am rather above the middling
height, and I may safely declare that I have no disposition to embonpoint, bear an
unblemished front, and have never been accused of the slightest irregularity of feature.
I am happy in the possession of a fine set of teeth. It would be impossible for me to form
i. .. a GREY Administration. My hair is dark chestnut ; my moustachios are rather
Ignier.
“In discharging the duties of my position in the waltz or the polka, I trust I have given
general satisfaction, and I have endeavoured, not, I hope, without success, to render myself
agreeable at pic-nics and fêtes. I flatter myself I am qualified to take a part in a duet.
“Should I be so fortunate as to become the man of your choice, I shall devote my most
earnest attention to all legislation having for its object the improvement of county balls,
and the establishment of agreeable arrangements at races. - -
.." I shall, as your representative, contend zealously for the abolition of all duties on foreign
silks, lace, gloves, and all other articles of dress or ornament. As a substitute for the
Income Tax, which has operated so injuriously in regard to housekeeping money, it is my
intention, to propose an equivalent increase of the present inadequate duty on, those nasty
horrible things, cigars, and all manner of tobacco. To this—combining a fiscal with a domestic
object–I would add a tax upon latch-keys. -
‘My best exertions should be always made to support a policy tending to the maintenance
of peace, whilst at the same time I should decidedly oppose any measure that would diminish
the number and variety of handsome uniforms, and deprive society ef any of those agreeable
officers whom you do the honour to consider its principal ornaments. -
“The party with which I have the honour to be associated is the Evening Party, and I
promise to be ever faithful to its colours as displayed in silk, satin, and muslin. In all that
relates to that branch of expenditure, my views are liberal. -
, “Should you confer on me the supreme felicity of being your representative in Parliament,
I shall never cease to pay that attention to costume, which I hope will secure me a con:
tinuance of § esteem and regard, and ever render me an interesting object viewed
from the Ladies' Gallery. My first Parliamentary effort will be made for the removal of
the kind of lattice-work in front of that gallery which at present intervenes between the
admiration of the British Senate and the smiles of Beauty.
“My person and sentiments, being such as I have described them, embolden me to hope for
the favourable opinion and support of ladies of all shades of complexion. In choosing me, I
will only add, you will send, a perfectly un-
fettered representative to Parliament, as, owing
to the di. of deciding between so many
conflicting claims to my homage, I have, hitherto,
reserved my liberty as a bachelor.
“I have the honour to be, Ladies,
“Your most Devoted and Obedient Servant,
“FIPPs De Bouquet.”
“ United Service Club, June 30, 1852."
TO SONG-BIRDS ON A SUNDAY.
SILENCE, all! ye winged choir;
Let not yon right reverend sire
Hear your happy symphony;
'Tis too good for such as he.
On the day of rest divine,
He poor townsfolk would confine
In their crowded streets and lanes,
Where they cannot hear your strains.
All the week they drudge away,
Having but one holiday;
No more time for you, than tha'—
Unlike bishops, rich and fat.
Utter not your cheerful sounds,
Therefore, in the bishop's grounds;
Make him melody no more,

he had meant no offence, the officer was ready to make an
apology.”

THOUGHTS ABOUT MONEY.
BY ONE WHO RARELY HAS ANY ; AND THEN, VERY LITTLE OF IT.
* HERE is no art which re-
quires so much delicacy to
practise, as the art of
Borrowing Money.
The only time, I think,
when a man loses all con-
sciousness of money, is
when he is up in a balloon;
and that is about the only
ſº also, I believe, where
e can really live with-
out it.
Death is made bitter to
many men from the pang
they feel at leaving their
gold behind them. lf
they could only take it
with them to Heaven,
they would die supremely
happy!
I always thought there
might be a much greater
simplicity of language, and
a far less hypocrisy of
laudation, on our tomb-
stones, if, instead of the
human qualities that are
generally heaped upon a
F man after he is in his
grave, one were simply to
express ... the amount of
wealth he died possessed, of. For instance, as plainly as this:—“Here lies JoHN Jones,
aged 41, who at his death was worth £100,000 ſ!!”. Could worldly praise possibly soar
higher? How ridiculously faint “universally beloved by all who knew him,” would read by
the side of an epitaph like the above
I am assured by the portess that “there is a silver lining to every cloud.” As I do not
live in the clouds, 1 cannot say; but I only wish there was a silver lining to every purse.
I have come to this impertinent conclusion—“The Englishman abroad is only tolerated
for his Money.”
The greatest consolation many men
events they “lost it like a gentleman.”
I once knew a great philosopher, who pretended to have a great contempt for the value of
money, until he was fined five shillings at a Police Office. He altered his opinion directly
after he had been imprisoned six weeks, because he couldn't pay the fine.
Of all expensive luxuries, man pays the dearest, perhaps, for that of Law. When once he
has entered a Court of Justice, he cannot take a step, nor speak, nor write a single word, nor
swear, nor, look at the Judge, without its costing him so much for each separate action.
I am sure the scales which The MIs balances in her hands, must be to hold the money which
Plaintiff and Defendant are expected to drop into them before she will trouble herself
to weigh the evidence. It's the heaviest purse that wins.
The men who inveigh the strongest against money and its corruption, and call it all sorts
of hard names, such as “dirty, dross,” “yellow dirt,” “filthy ſucre,” &c., &c., I have
generally found to be the hardest men to deal with, and the most rapaciously exacting
in all their pecuniary transactions; men, in short, who would sacrifice a principle any
day, sooner than lose a sixpence
The fact of a man losing his fortune, I can imagine to be not half so painful as the comments
of his friends upon it. .
To make money to enjoy it, I can understand easily enough; but to make money merely to
shut it up in your drawers, surpasses my comprehension of financial enjoyment. Yet the
miser devotes his whole life to no other pursuit. He makes money as the Master of the
Mint makes it, to let others have the enjoyment of it. His existence is but a living exem-
plification of the torment of SISYPHUs, only instead of a big stone, he is continually rolling
up and down a tremendous bag of gold.
The Portico of Life has no inscription upon it. ... I recommend the following:—“Pay
Here;” for, on my word, it is nothing but a system of paying from beginning to end.
C The only man who managed, to my knowledge, to live without money, was RoBINson
RUSOE.
A man may owe as much money as he º and be thought none the worse for it; but
if he leaves a single debt of honour unpaid, he immediately forfeits all pretensions to the title
of a gentleman. -
Nothing so pitiful as a Lord without money in the society of City {. (the most gentish
form of Gentism is, I believe, the Gentism of money), unless it is a City gent. with plenty of
money, in the society of Lords.
There are two classes of poor—the rich Poor, and the poor Poor. The rich Poor are
those who, like myself, are poor, and care nothing about it. The poor Poor are those who
not only are poor, but are ashamed of being poor. Such men are the very poorest of all
poor people, and by the side of one of them, Ijingle the keys in my pocket and imagine they
are sovereigns.

If a man is economical, or penurious, or
extravagant at home, it is entirely owing to his
wife; for no man understands the art of saving

A DISPLAY OF SCOLLARDSHIP.
It is unhappily the fact that inability to read
and write prevails to a great extent among our
rural population. Subjoined, however, is a gra-
tifying proof that the rudiments of learning are
not altogether unknown to the British peasantry.
The original document was a manuscript, on a
piece of le ter paper, of which the back, be:
daubed with glue, suggested that it had served
as an affiche to some barn-door :
“Arkengarthdale Feast Sports
Will commence on Munday May 31 1852

A Donke Raice For a Bridel

And a Menney other sports To Tedious

There is something peculiarly interesting about
this announcement. Being a work of penman-
ship, it reminds us of those good old times that
preceded the invention of printing—an art, and
mystery which perhaps has not even yet been
revealed to the Arcadians of Arkengarth Dale.
Then its orthography also very closely resembles
that of our ancestors, and may, to borrow a term
from architecture, be described as a fine speci-
men of early English. Among its merits—per-
spicuity, or, indeed, perfect intelligibility cannot
be enumerated; what the “Cettel” which is
“To Shut For,” may be, is more than we can
tell; and we can only, conjecture that it is a
settle or seat of some kind, or peradventure a
scuttle, which is to be the prize of marksmanship.
The "row fog Trails Ribbens To Dance for.”
are things of which, except that they are in the
dual number, and ribbons of some sort, we can
form no idea. That very comprehensive item
that concludes the programme, “Menney other
sports To Tedious To Mentian. At Present,”
whilst indicating the difficulty with which it was
drawn up, and which is further attested by a very
irregular round hand, implies a hope on the
of the writer that at some future time, possibly,
he may be enabled to use his pen with greater
facility. Let us trust that he will, by the kind
Fº of certain persons. Why is it that

write donkey no better than he probably can
his own name * and why is there the same large
room for improvement, in the scholarship of
thousands such as himself? Because contending
zealots cannot agree with what theological mys.
teries they shall leaven the common information
which the schoolmaster is to impart to the
country bumpkin.

AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCLE.
Y the Court Circular's
report of the late baptism
of the Indian Princess,
we are informed that
“After the christening, the
distinguished circle were con-
ducted to the Dinner-room,
where luncheon was served."
A circle is so very dis-
tinct a thin
can hardl Tm a Con-
ception of it as a noun
of multitude; and there
is somewhat painful in
the statement that a
circle were conducted.
If the wording had
been, was conducted, its
grammar would have
been less queer, but its
sense not much more
intelligible: for who can
understand how a circle,
however distinguished,
* can be conducted into
a room? Did the royal
party lock themselves
together in a ring by
their heads and heels,
! and have themselves
trundled into the dinner-
room in the shape of
a living hoop, after the
manner in which Mes-
sieurs Clown and Panta-
loon roll off the stage?
We must say that

able partiality is shown

THE FARE versus THE CABMAN.
If there are any words unutterable
with any degree of propriety by the
female voice, they are the exclamations
“Hoy!” “Hallo!” “Now then, I
say!” and “Hold hard!” It is true
that Sydney SMITH called woman an
interjectional animal; but ladies' in-
terjections, however numerous, should
not, in point of strength, exceed the
expressions “Oh!” or “My " The
arsh and stern ejaculations of warn-
ing and commandare unsuitable to the
gentle sex, and that they should ever
be obliged to employ such means to
attract attention, is very disgraceful
to those who reduce them to that ne-
cessity. These remarks are provoked
by the fact, that cabmen, in addition to
other villanies, very generally neglect
to connect themselves with their
check-strings: the consequence of
which omission is, that a lady having
the misfortune to be alone in one of
their vehicles, when she wants to stop,
is forced to poke her head out of the
window, and shout and scream in the
unbecoming terms above-mentioned.
Even to a man, not being a coster-
monger or a hawker of mackarel, it
is a fº nuisance to have to roar and
bawl for a purpose which might be so
much more easily accomplished by
pulling a string. There is, we think,
a penalty incurred by cabmen for the
negligence in question, and it is sug-
gested that those who cannot be
stopped by their check-strings, should
be otherwise pulled up.

“OUR CRITIC” AMONG THE PICTURES.
MR. Megilp is furious with me, on account of that last paper. “Do
you mean to say,” he asks me," that º are to cease working for
the people who buy their pictures P. There's my Discovery of the
Body of —

“Well. There it is still in my studio, fourteen feet by nine, just
as it came back from Westminster Hall. Who'll buy that work,
I should, like to know? . There's, SIR John CINNABAR admires it
excessively—indeed he insists it's the best thing I’ve done, but, as he
says ‘where is one to hang an acre of canvas?’ No–no. Don't talk
to me of what painters were, and what pictures used to be. If we are
to º pictures now-a-days, they must be pictures that will go into
such houses as people live in now-a-days. If they won't do that, where
the deuce are they to go?”
MR. MEGILP reasons logically enough from his point of view. If there
be indeed no employer for the painter but the connoisseur who buys his
º: to fill a space on his walls, and no destination for his work
ut the private gallery, I do not see how we are to escape Mr. MEGILP's
conclusion, which, indeed, is the one generally acquiesced in. To it we
owe our present modes, notions, and results in Art,
But is there no hope beyond this? I cannot help thinking there is
one, a possibility of which (as MR. DISRAELI expresses it), already
“looms in the future.”
The days of the Popes and the Doges, of the D'Estes, and
Gonzagas, and MEDIcis, of the merchant princes of Florence and
Genoa, of the monks of Assisi, and the friars of the Certosa are passed
away. There is no mistake about patrons of this class. Church and
State have done their best for Art, and will do no more; at least in
this country. - -
Small German Princes, with no troublesome Parliaments to control
the supplies, may, indeed, make so many German Athenses of their little
capitals. Munich and Dresden, and even Berlin, still find work for the
CoRNELIUsts, and KAULBAchs, and BENDEMANNs. Schools of historic
Art have been fostered in these places into as much life as schools of
Art can have where there is no life of a nation to transfuse into them.
And by the side of this historic Art has grown up, thanks to the same
royal patronage, a religious Art also, of the dead-alive kind, which, in
defauſt of a real live religious Art is worthy of respect, perhaps. Nay,
the same struggles and aspirations which found.theologic vent, in
Oxford tracts, and incarnate themselves in a J. H. NEWMAN, and other
eminent perverts, have had their counterpart in Art, also, even in this
country. Our HERBERTs and Pugins are quite worthy to sit by the
side of the Over Becks and Hesses. But the artist, thus inspired,
finds as little acceptance in the heart of †† as the theologian. It
is a dilettante business after all, to which MR. John BULL rests a
stranger, or, if he feel at all, rather dislikes upon the whole.
I cannot help thinking, in spite of the vehement protest of MR. MEGILP,
that if Art in England is ever to be raised into a grand and fruitful life,
it must ally itself to the things that make England what she is... As
SIR. Edward Bulwen Lytton would say, the Ideal must wed the Real
in these islands, in order to beget the Beautiful: , .
There is our public life, waiting to be enshrined in the new Houses
of Parliament. Here is suggestion, and inspiration, and subject-matter
for the artist, and no lack of room and verge for him to disport in.
Surely our MacLises, and LANDseeks, and HERBERTs, and Cores, and
Dyces, our WARDs, and FR1Ths, and Eggs, our WATTSEs, and ARMi-
TAGEs, and TENNIELs, could nowhere be more worthily employed than
inside those walls, working for the People of England, paid by the
People of England, to illustrate the glorious progress of that People's
growth, from the times when it toddled in its primitive infancy of woad
and sheepskin, up to these days of beaver and broadcloth.
MR. John Buil, though by no means a heroic figure, outwardly, in
this nineteenth century, is a gentleman whose birth, parentage an
education present very remarkable passages. In recording these
there would be employment for more than, all the thought and skill, all
the various capacities, and tastes, and tendencies, of our best painters.
MR. MEGILP might even here find a market for his Discovery of the
Body of—we all know who. We might here work off all pur
accumulated stores of curious lore in costume and brio-à-brac, and find
into the bargain noble lay figures to hang the velvet and brocade upon.
It is true that Parliament stands between John BULL and his
historical painters, guarding the portal of MR. BULL's future picture

Financial Reformer, cannot see what business Ministers have to be
spending MR. BULL's money on statues and pictures, and such trash.
ut if once MR. BULL can be brought to understand that the work of
Art is not mere upholstery and room-decoration, but may be the stately
and fair commemoration of his most cherished memories—the recording
of the most decisive transactions of his past life, from the date when,
a naked little savage, he gave that warm reception to JULIUS CAESAR,
we cannot but think that MR. BULL would make short work of the
grumblings of MAcquEEDY and MacGREEDY. But there is more than
the public life of MR. John BULL to be recorded. In this, I am
thankful to say, ground has been broken already. The scaffoldings are
already up in Westminster, and the walls of the New Houses of Parlia-
ment even now glow with the enduring colours of fresco. HAMPDEN
and FAULKLAND and CLARENDON already stand in marble, to remind
all who enter John BULL's Great Hall of Council, of those who have
best spoken and written and fought for his right to occupy those
premises. But as to the other aspects of MR. BULL's life, he has not
#. so much as thought, apparently, how Art could be employed about
hº.
Manchester could build its Free Trade Hall, and Liverpool is justly
proud of that stately edifice which bears the name of MR. BULL's patron
saint. But those walls are naked. Why should not the history of
mechanic industry, and the marvellous annals of commerce be set up
in colour and in marble, there, in the scene of their grandest triumphs f |
Here were work indeed worthy of Art, and worthy of England. And
it is not in these great towns alone that such work might be done. The
whole of these islands is printed over with the footsteps of great men,
and the traces of great actions. What Art-record of ShakspeaRe
adorns Stratford-on-Avon? Runnymede is innocent of all comme-
moration of Magna Charta. What material trace of BACON is to be
found in Gray’s Inn? What light do the encaustics of HERR SANG
throw on the history of trade and commerce in the city of London?

MINISTERIAL AFTER-WHITE-BAIT-DINNER JOKES.
MR. WALPOLE suggested that “the brave soldiers belonging to the
º: Army of Astley's—and, who had been through more cam-
paign; than any army in the world—should each be allowed to have a
vote.’
THE DUKE OF NoFTHUMBERLAND, “couldn't help observing that it
was extremely lucky the Wessel of the State had never been in a Govern-
ment Dockyard, or else it must have fallen all to pieces, or have gone
to the bottom long ago.”
SIR John PAKINGTON was “rather pleased than otherwise, that it
was so extremely difficult to hear in the present House of Commons, as
it saved one the unpleasantness of answering many a troublesome
question. In fact, he for one should like the House all the better, if
one couldn't hear at all.”
THE EARL OF MALMESBURY_had “been informed upon very good
authority, that the EMPEROR SouLouquE was fully prepared to ask
explanations of the French President as to his intentions of assuming
the title of Emperor, as he was determined to resist any such attempt
onº º of Louis NAPOLEON to cast ridicule upon his Imperial rank
and title.”
One of the Lords of the Treasury gave notice, that “he should apply
for a public grant of money to put in repair the House of Brunswick.
It was a disgrace to the nation to talk so much about the “House of
Brunswick, and to leave it in such a tottering state of ruin, as it was
now in at the Nine Eims, near Vauxhall Bridge.”

MR. TIBBs having hurried from the City to meet J’MIMA in the Park,

IRISH REVOLUTION.
The Irish make a fuss about their nationality; but they are losing it.
In proof of this fact, take the following story, related by the Glasgow
Constitutional, but without that obvious comment which it will be our
duty to make.
“An IRIsh CAPITAList.—A gentleman in Newcastle was applied to some time
by an Irishman in his employment, to see if he could assist him in the investment of
a hundred pounds. “A hundred pounds !” said he: “where have you picked up such
a sum ?” “It's all my wages since I came to work for you, your honour.” “But how
have you lived in the meantime?” “My wife keeps the house, and we save what I
earn.” “And what does you wife work at?” “Why, the truth is, your honour, she
goes out every day with the children, and cadges.”
“Cadges”—begs, that is, my ladies, may it please your graces and
innocences. But think of the change which the above anecdote—
together with many other similar indications—shows to be taking place
in the Irish character. Our Glasgow contemporary, of all journalists,
might have noticed it. The Irishman is now assuming that disposition
to providence and frugality which was heretofore º: to be
the distinctive genius of Scotchmen. Great political results may arise
from this transformation of the Irish mind; order, perhaps, and obedi-
ence to the laws—accompanied by industrious enterprise, usual ablution,
and habitual veracity. At present we will only commend it to the
attention of dramatists, advertising them that they must quite remodel
the stage son of Erin, who must no longer be the light-hearted Irishman,
but the canny Celt, and must entirely cease, to talk about “paltry”
money, and to invoke the foul fiend to “fly away with the dirt
shillings,” but instead of uttering those extravagant sentiments, wi

MISS VIOLET AND HER “OFFERS.”
CHAPTER XII.
Miss Violet's Papa to an old legal friend.
“My DEAR ZAchARY,
“You are an excellent conveyancer, , and your pupil,
MR. ALBANY Swellington, is a very earnest and honourable young
man, But, you can only speak according to your respective lights,
which, at this present writing, are as false lights as ever Cornishman
hung out to sea-captain., Your pupil has, proposed to my Violet, and
has been rejected, but whatever he may think, or you may say, ALBANY
will not betake himself to the bed of the Thames, or even to a cradle
on the banks of an Australian Pactolus.
“You old spinner of nets to catch remainder-men, and reversioners,
and inheritors to the third and fourth generation, are you coming out
with a heart? You pretending to mind the interests of anybody who
is already born?, You, whose protective care, for the last forty years
(ever since you betook yourself to Lincoln's Inn upon, pretty Miss
Esther, GARGLE refusing your arm, and going with Volunteer Jorps
to see the Allied Sovereigns in the Park), has been devoted to the
prospective babies who, are to take,” in future ages, under, your
reticulated entails. And you write to me in all sincerity, to plead a
love cause for your pupil, who will do something, you are well assured,
to be rid of a hateful life. ... Is that all you know about Assurance on
Life, my old ZACHARY | The Assurance Society that gave you three
hundred guineas to make tight work of their title to the Claretcup estates
(comprising the townships of Swaggerty, Farrago, and Killbayliffe,
...}. have been slightly cheated in you. ZACHARy, you
are not half informed upon the matter; and I tell you so point blank,
because, to the conveyancing intellect, I know that intimation cometh
as a dead †. , or estoppel, as you musically call it.
“So he has been reading in your chambers for six months in the most
exemplary manner-copying your precedents with a steam-power of
scribble; never sending out your hired clerk for beer in the day-time,
as is the manner of other pupils; never drawing Ceritoes and Rosatis
on your draft paper, and leaving them about for the inspection of the
evangelical attorneys who come to see you; never fencing or wrestling
with his friends in your front parlour while consultations were going
on in the back room; and never discomfiting your clients, in your
absence, by volunteer opinions that their claims are all moonshine, and
that they had better abandon them, and not make fools of themselves.
You speak as a worthy, orderly man, whose soul has been vexed by
youths with animal spirits and inconsiderate minds. I am glad that
ALBANY has come at last to comfort you, and it speaks well for your
nature that you are trying to elicit some comfort for him. But I have
lived, and loved, and so forth, and if you had kicked Volunteer Jopps
and married Esther, as you ought to have done, you would have
known enough to agree with me in thinking that Master ALBANY has
already found some crumbs of comfort for fi.if You never put the
language of a testator to the rack, to wrench out the meaning you
wanted, as he has twisted, and turned, and tortured every word spoken
at our interview at Brighton here on Sunday evening. I know the
process. The word ‘lace,’ in the Tale of a Tub, was discovered by
LoRD PETER (who wished to wear the prohibited finery), to mean, in
the original, a ‘broomstick, which, therefore, he dutifully abstained
from affixing to his coat. That is a mild marginal reading compared
to what a young gentleman or lady, with sympathies, will make out of
a few kindly words of parent or guardian. And I gave MASTER
ALBANY a good many, but I rejected his proposals.
“Do you spy any comfort for him in those last four words, ZACHARY
of the Entails? I say, I rejected him. For my Violet had made up
her mind to marry him, and, between ourselves, though I employ the
past tense, I do not imply that her mood is altered. My private im-
pression is that she will marry him, but she is the best little girl in the
whole world,” as well as the prettiest (what are you laughing at, Zachary
KINGsilverif), and she will take care that, theatrically speaking, the
words, “Who giveth this Violet to be married to this ALBANY,” shall
be the cue for, “I do—her father.' ... Meantime, do you think your
bemoaning pupil has not said to himself at least a billion of times—'I
am certain she loves me, and it was only the old man after all, and I
shall be Lord Chancellor one of these days, and LoRD ELDoN ran away
with — He go over the bridge—he go over to Australasia!
“I have nothing to say against him in the matter. He had managed
to secure Violet's affections, and to make her fully aware that he was
devoted to her. And armed with some sort of permission on the child's
part, he came to me, and made a revelation in a ſrank and manly
manner. He said that he had about four hundred a year under his
father's will, and having never had anything to do but spend it, he had
quite done that, and about four hundred a year more; which, if he had
been a Currency. Questioner, he would have said was not represented
#. capital of his own: but which, he explicitly described as debt.
aving no object of his own, he had been for five or six years adopting
other people's objects. SIR CRACKEY Bouncº stalked deer, and
ALBANY laid down on his stomach and crawled with CRACKey over half
the hills in Scotland. MR. SPANKER Boom went yachting, and
MR. SwellingtoN eat GAMBLE's preserved meats in Ramsgate Harbour.
The Honour ABLE MUMBLE Fitzplumb stood for a borough, and
ALBANY speechified from the Cross Keys window, and chucked the
chins of constitutional babies. Young łło. PastERN ran horses,
and young ALBANY SwellingtoN backed them, and sometimes, rode
them. And thus, holding the tenor of everybody's way who came in his
own, he had lounged on through life, but not so, slowly as that the
constable could at all keep up with him. . For all these, things cost
money, and ready money, too, while coats, boots, and studs, are being
made into “materials for history,” with notes, by occasional discounters.
All this he told me, not carelessly, but as if, having discovered that life
might be something better than a lounge, he was anxious to fall into
quick step; and by way of getting into marching order, he had, some
months ago, paid you a hundred guineas (raised with no small difficulty)
for leave to sit in your chambers and study LoRD St. LeoNARDs on
“Wendors and Purchasers.” Imagine little Violet having the honour of
procuring his lordship a new reader. . . - -
“I pointed out to him that, upon his own showing, he was in no
position to marry: for though I would not demand that a man should
work himself into middle life before making an offer, I did not think
marriage should be the very first proof that he was in earnest. Con-
gratulating him—not in mere phrases, but cordially—on the honourable
course he was pursuing, I declined to let Violet enter into an
engagement; nor would I hold out any promise for the future. If
she loves him, and if the stuff is in him (and, you old ZACHARY, you
are to keep this to yourself), I dare say we shall have another
interview some day, and then there may be a job for you, ZAchARY of
the Settlements.
“ALBANY went away looking very unhappy, and VIOLET has, I believe,
had a little private cry, or so, but she is too sensible and right-hearted,
as well as too affectionate, to pout. Besides, she is consoled, I will swear,
by a perfect certainty that HER MAJESTY will, one of these days, order
a new woolsack, expressly for Lord CHANCELLOR Swell,INGTON.
Many a true heart, Zach, as you know well, has clung to such a con-
viction through years of solitude, and struggſ , and sorrow, and, living
upon hope, has 3. fasting. But we shall, *...* manage things a
little better than that; though, candidly speaking do not much expect
to see BARon ALBANY kneel in the House of Lords, and present the
QUEEN with her Speech.
“Now, my old friend, do you understand matters better? If your
upil drowns himself, he shall not have Violet; and I have as much
intention of sending her to the diggings as he has of going there.
So no more at present from “Your old schoolfellow,
“Brighton. “BRIDLEGoose BROMPTON.”
“PS. If A. S. chooses to take .." into his confidence, and through
any of your attorney friends you like to put his debts in train for gradual
liquidation, I should not much mind lending you some money to that
end. But be horribly discreet—keep me out of sight- and don't spoil
a salutary process, ZAchARIAs. Come down, and have a Brill.”

YE FRIAR OF ORDERS BLACKE.
- sº N

It was a friar of orders blacke
Went forth the streetes to walke;
And he met with a stranger there,
Who fain with hym wolde talke.
“Now come, I say, thou reverend friar,
I pray thee tell to mee,
Why goest thou about the towne,
Soe strange a sight to see?”
“What makes mee look a stranger sight
Than many another one?”
“Oh 'tis thy cloke and wide-awake,
And 'tis thy sandal shoon.
“And 'tis this crosse beneath thy chin,
And eke thy shaven jowle,
Withal the gryme upon thy skin,
Soe dingy and soe foule.”
“The reason why, about the towne,
I in these weedes doe goe;
It is because the CARDINALL
He hath ordayned soe.
“He wylls us up and downe to wend,
In sandals and in cloke
That we may be a daily sight
Unto the common folke;
“To use them to my freres and me,
His EMINENCE dothe hope
That soe the liefer they shall bec
To owne our Lorde the Pope.”
“But hearest thou not how all the dogs
Do bark as thou goest by:
And small boys running att thy heeles,
Do hoote thee for a Guy "
"Qh ! stranger fair, oh!, stranger fair,
In soothe I doe not minde
For persecution soche as thatt,
But joy therein do finde.”
“Yea butt, yeabutt, thou reveiend friar,
Obstrucsyon thou dost cause,
Adventurest to breake the peace,
And dost transgress the lawes.”
“I doe not care, I wold not sticke
Obstrucsyon for to make,
Or breake the peace and lawes to boote,
For Mother Church her sake,”
“Now, sayest thou soe, thou scurvy friar?
I charge thee, goe with mee;
For that I am a constable,
Though in plain clothes I bee.
“I’ll take thee to the station-house,
Eſtsoons, before the Beke;
And we will know if soche as thou,
The lawes shall dare to breake.”
Upon his collar he layd his hande,
And walk'd the friar away;
And all the crowd that ran thinde,
Did whoop and cry hooraye.
WHAT I SAW AT THE DIGGINGS.
(By one who has mentally visited them.)
I saw .# which, as a gentleman of England, living at home at
ease, I should have dreamed myself perhaps electro-biologised to
dream of:—
I saw husbands buttonless, but ºl.
I saw bachelors of misogynic aspect sedulously rocking the cradle.
I saw several members of the Meddler family diligently minding
their own business instead of everybody else's.
I saw many a social bore-boring, literally, to some purpose here.
I saw lots of London loungers enjoying the utter reverse of "otium
cum dig.”
I saw several of my “used up” friends experiencing quite a new
sensation in the pickaxe.
t saw that gourmand GUTTLER pitching contentedly into a kangaroo
Chop.
I saw that ex-ſop, SwellingtoN, dressed in corduroys and highlows,
and most complacently intent upon washing out his last week's shirt.
(For I mentally italicised that emphatic singular.)
I saw many an emigrated pauper picking up a decent living for
himself, here, merely with his pickaxe. -
I saw many an expatriated Maieworm, who, deeming gold to be “the
root of evil,” certainly proved himself most zealous in assisting to
eradicate it.
And finally, I saw on all sides abundant evidence to show that one
of the richest fields for enterprise, was now—the Gold Field.
QUESTIONS FOR CANDIDATES.
THE constituencies of these dominions are now about to be called
upon to perform the important duty of electing their representatives;
those legislators in whose hands, perhaps for the next seven years, the
destinies of the nation, for good or evil, will mainly lie.
Having to make those who are to make the laws; in order that the
laws may be well made, you must use your best endeavours in making
your law-makers.
Electors commonly suppose that they have done all that is necessary
when they have exacted pledges to vote, in this or that manner from
candidates: and a .. is judged fit to represent the free and
independent if only he can say his political catechism at the hustings.
But the political catechism does not go far enough. A Member of
Parliament should know history, geography, finance, political economy,
and, if not mathematics, at least common ciphering, and a few other
sciences on which sound legislation is based. In addition to the
political catechism, therefore, he ought to be able to repeat certain
other popular catechisms; and, not to be too hard on country gentlemen,
gay Pinnock’s. -
At any rate, don't vote for anybody who cannot answer the questions
in the Abridgement of GoLDSMITH's History of England, or who cannot
do a Rule of Three sum. Look especially after your candidate's arith-
metic—unless you wish for a perpetual and unmodified Income Tax.
We must congratulate our contemporary, the Mark Lane Express,
upon having made a pun. We are refreshed to find that in speaking
of the EARL of DERby's late speech upon “Compromise,” its com-
ments end, somewhat naively, thus:
“We can only express our sincere hope that the tenant farmers may not find them-
selves in the end compromised.”
The italics, it is needless to say, are not ours... They denote
emphatically the maiden effort, and so disarm our criticism. But in
truth we are too happy to be critical. We have heard such grievous
stories (literally such, we begin to fear) of agricultural depression lately,
that it indeed immeasurably rejoices us to find the farmers’ oracle can
still produce a joke, and its distressed readers even yet afford—to
laugh at it.

agreeable creatures, it was thought advisable to keep them down in size.]
A REVEREND COMET.
Of all the wonderful things that, ever appeared in the Dumfries
Courier, the most wonderful is an advertisement, recently published,
purporting to be put forth by a clergyman who is actually “starring it
* * provinces.” It begins by informing those whom it may concern,
a
THE REV. DAVID M. GILLESPIE begs leave to intimate that he
intends to Preach over the different Congregations of this diocese, on the exact
same days or periods of the year he has done in time past.
As he means to preach over them, it is to be hoped his sermons will
not do them any harm. Let that pass. The announcement proceeds:
“N.R.—He will Preach at GLENCAPLE QUAY (when the company comes down to
sea-bathing quarters) on the First SUNDAY of August in the £vening; and at the
Wateh or Canarx (his own beautiful and romantic spot), Cangex Bridge, on the
Second Sunday or August. At both places Psalms and Prayers will begin at 6
o'clock precis-ly. At the latter place several respectable peace-officers will be
in attendance as usual.”
We read and re-read this paragraph with a strange feeling which, for
a long time, we could not define. Gradually the indistinct emotion
developed itself into the reminiscence of an old friend. Who was he
that was to preach at Glencaple Quay—but not until the season “when
the º comes down to sea-bathing quarters?” Who could it be
but our old friend JENKINs? Yes: it is a clear case. Jenkins has
cast the plush, and put on the cloth—the Scotch cloth, which we
presume is a sable variety of the tartan: donned the surplice in the
place of the shoulder-knot, MR. JENKINs has entered the service of
the Church—where some, however, may consider that he is still out
of place. Doubtless Gillespie is but an alias for JENKINs: but, if
there were any doubt about the matter, the next paragraph would
settle it:
“These congregations, since their commencement (it is well known), are usually
attended by persons in the higher ranks of life: and without any accusation of vanity,
in some instances by persons of the first respectability in the kingdom: nevertheless
the humble are neither despised nor neglected, as the sick poor are regularly and
attentively visited in every period of the year. If all is well, the whole course will
be completed by the Fourth Sabbath of November.”
The allusion to the “persons in the higher ranks of life,” the use of
the present for the past tense, the incomprehensibility of congregations
being attended without any accusation of vanity, the singular distinc-
tion between the majority of the higher ranks, and the few consisting
of “persons of the first respectability in the kingdom,” betray the hand
of the—servant. - - -
The peculiar candour of JENKINs also shines like any boot in the
following:
“P.S. D. M. G. intimates, that if the weather should be rainy—in any place (even
where sermon is advertised)—if it should be a regular, professed, or confirmed wet
day, he need not be expected; for, however gratifying it has often been to him to see
crowds of people standing in the rain awaiting his arrival, yet it is most pernicious
to his health, which would not stand it. And in that case he will come again, as soon
as convenience will admit, giving due intimation.
“Nithbank, near Dumfries, 16th June, 1852."
Jenkins does not mind owning the delight which he derives from the
sense of being attractive. He frankly says it is gratifying to him to
see crowds of people standing waiting for him in the rain; albeit, that
to partake of their soaking would be “most pernicious to his health,
which would not stand it.” The danger of their health not standing it
either, does not seem to have occurred to him: this little inconsiderate-
ness he may have learned in genteel families. - -
What sort of orders, MR., JENKINs can have received, different
from those mandates which he has been, accustomed to, some may
uestion: but, so, genteel a person should be nothing...less than a
useyite: as the histrionic style of his advertisement indicates him to
be—a Tractarian, ultimately developed into a strolling parson. We
would advise him, by the way, to drop his assumed name: there are
many hot Scotchmen of the name of GILI:Espie, and if he does not
mind, he may get something which his hand is familiar with laid across
his shoulders.

EMPLOYMENT OF PAUPERS AT ELECTIONS.
St. PANCRAs—on the motion of a vestryman—has contributed a
certain number of paupers to carry election boards in the cause of
Marylebone candidates, LoRD DUDLEY STUART and SIR. B. HALL
who are to be elected free of expense; a yº. proper liberality, to
which Punch offers not the shadow of an objection: nevertheless,
MR. Spoon ER (can this be NEwdrigATE's Spoon ERP) strongly, though
vainly, “deprecated the proposed proceeding’ of lending paupers for
election purposes. “Many of them *-argued Spoon ER—" had held a
goodit." in society; and wherefore should they submit to the
degradation of parading the streets with a placard attached to their
ies f". A paper blister at the back, and a paper blister at the belly;
covered with the most caustic of printer's-ink in letters of “Hall and
Free Trade /?” “Stuart and Wote by Ballot /* This we confess to be
shocking: it might be otherwise did the aspiration run—“Protection
for ever?” “Spooner and no Maynooth /* There are causes in which
men may gird on placards, proudly as Achilles put on his new
coat of mail. And there are causes that degrade even Union paupers,
accustomed to the elevating employment of teazing oakum, and now
and then dignified by the severer and simpler duty of stone-breaking.
That the idea of employing the Union poor of England as election
agents and instruments for the return of a Protection Parliament has
a significant felicity, is most evident from the heap of letters—(all from
Unions)—lying before us. Seeing that Free Trade has multiplied the
number of the poor; seeing that the pestiferous policy of Cobden AND
Co. has emptied our cupboards, id filled our workhouses, it is an
admirable idea, alive with the justest retribution, that the
England should, if needed, turn out to a man, to carry a
majority strong and triumphant on their backs to Parliament.
“UNION is STRENGTH !”
Such, indeed, may be the proud motto, for the nonce, of the DERby
Čabinetº with its army of placarded paupers arrayed against the Free-
booter FreeTrade. -
With this preface, we proceed to lay before the reader copies of a
few of the letters received by Mr. Punch from certain inmates of
certain Unions, all burning to enrol themselves of the army of DERby ;
their ardour kindled by a sense of injury committed upon them by Free
Trade. It will be seen that every writer, to a man, owed his
pauperism to PEEL, CoBDEN, and Free Trade.

“MR. PUNCH,-I was one of the smallest of farmers, with an English-
man's fireside, two hunters, and a grand piano for my daughter (who
is now at Port Philip);... when ruin drove me from my hearth, my hunters

FreeTrade. As if Blitons—who haven’t bowels to be slaves—could live
upon black bread, like Iceland serfs and Polish refugees. Therefore,
I shall be º to carry any boards for Lord DERBy; and hope he’ll
let us all out of the Bastilles, that we may once again send wheat up to
the wholesome 70s., a, quarter, and put his Lordship for life—with
MR. DisrAELI to help him—in the ël. of his country.

Navigation Laws—sent 'em to the pawnbroker's, where in course they

Laws was repealed—and I’ll be jº by MR. G. F. YoUNG—there
was seven thousand five hundred and twenty-one happy waterman's
wherries on the flourishing Thames (not counting them as was
building), and now, for seven thousand, there isn't—as I’m told, and
I'll be judged by MR. Young again—there isn't seventy; all the rest
laying rotting ashore, with rats in 'em as big as buck rabbits, and all
with Free Trade, which will give us over, bound hand and foot, to the
proud and ramping foreigner.

“Honoured Sir, Hearing that Fº as we are all called (for which |

the Manchester School, who think the Cotton Tree the Tree of all

the pensioners, to aid the DERBY Cabinet in their noble stru gle for
Protection—in their glorious attempts to dispel the Fog of Peelism
and Prejudice, which has so long blinded the eyes of John Buli,
preventing him from clearly seeing what possibly may loom in the future;
—hearing, Mr. Punch, that there is to a Pauper Demonstration of
the Baneful Effects of Free Trade: its thousands of victims now in the
Unions to be employed as board men, I beg to say, in behalf of myself
and fellow-sufferers of the – Union, that we pant to show our care:

its branches—to the conviction of our betrayed and bamboozled country-

abode of competence and peace until the market was thrown open to
slave-grown sugar. That ruthless measure (for, I assure you it was
not in any way owing to my trifling losses at Thim BLEPEA's Betting-

measure, that whilst it ºriei sugar also rivetted the iron of the

THE POLITICAL SHOE-BLACK.
Austria. “What's your charge?”
LoRD M-Lº-BURY. “Oh, I make no charge; any little compensation
will do for me.”
JUDICIAL CLAP-TRAPS.
An impetus has lately been ſº to the waning interest of the pro-
ceedings in Westminster Hall, by the conversion of the Court of
Queen's Bench into a sort of theatre, in which some of the fine old
clap-traps that have long been banished from the stage as obsolete,
have been reproduced with an effect truly marvellous. The superior
courts have been recently doing such “wretched business”—to make
use of a theatrical term—that the principal actors, who have been the
recognised “leading men” for the last ten years, have been cut down
to less than half salaries, while the County Courts have been attracting
crowds to their doors. The high prices have, no doubt, contributed
materially to the desertion of the º established concerns, which have
indeed sometimes been closed, in consequence of the “business”
having become so bad as to have dwindled to none at all. The legal
season has, however been wound up by a few “extraordinary per-
formances,” in which a new feature has been introduced in the sha
of a series of judicial clap-traps, some of which told most effectually
with the audience; though we very much doubt whether they are
calculated to add permanently to the reputation of the actors, or to
exalt the theatre in the opinion of the public. As it is not unlikely
that the example which has been set this season will be followed in the
next, we beg leave to state that we shall be ready to supply judicial
clap-traps for the use of the Bench, forensic clap-traps for the Bar,
constitutional, commercial, and general clap-traps for jurymen, and
miscellaneous clap-traps for witnesses or other persons concerned.
As we do not wish to profess more than we can prove our ability to
rform, we º: to offer the following samples to the Judges, the
ar, and the public in general.
A JUDICIAL CLAP-TRAP.
A witness having been sworn, who says that he is a sheriff's officer,
the following scene occurs:-
The Judge. This man is an officer of the sheriff.
Counsel. He is, my Lord.
The Judge. In allowing him to be received as a witness, I cannot
forget that the sheriff is charged with the office of execution in a double
sense; but I do not recognise him now as the agent of the sanguinary
code that once existed in this country, but which happily exists no longer.
(Applause.) I am not afraid of being supposed to sanction that code
because I admit this man as a witness, for we live, fortunately, under
a milder state of things; and Heaven forbid that we should ever see
the severities of that code restored. (Tremendous applause, which nobody
attempts to check.) I repeat, that I have no apprehensions in admitting
this evidence. because I feel that we live in happier times. (Fainter
applause, which the Usher attempts to stimulate.) f say again, we enjoy
the blessings of a more humane system; and I receive the evidence of
this sheriff's officer, without fear of being supposed to sympathise with
the cruelties of which his calling was once the symbol. (No applause
at all, with murmurs of “Too much of it,” which the Judge instantly
checked.)
A FORENSIC CLAP-TRAP.
The cause for trial is an action by one * doctor against another,
for damages sustained in the violation of an agreement respecting a
pretended specific to cure every disease.
Counsel. It may be said, gentlemen of the jury, that my client is a
Pretender! A Pretender—let me dwell upon that word! Happily we
may now dwell upon it in these happy days without raking up old
animosities, lighting up the old bonfires of passion, whose fuel was the
human heart, or scarifying old sores, whose seat was the human bosom.
I may now dwell upon the word Pretender without exposing myself to
the suspicion of party feeling, and without being charged with a desire
to set brother against brother, or to plant the cousin's hand in the kins-
man's heart. Having said thus much, gentlemen of the jury, I confi-
dently leave the result between your consciences and yourselves. (Much
cheering followed the learned counsel's having taken his seat.)
cLap-tRAP for a JURYMAN.
The jury having been desired to withdraw to consider their verdict,
the following scene ensues:-
Jaryman. I fear we shall not agree, my Lord.
Judge. I can't help that, gentlemen.
Juryman. But, my Lord, do not misunderstand me. I feel that I am
a part-nay, a twelfth-of the greatest of Britain's bulwarks, and rather
than come to an unconscientious decision, I would let my parched tongue
lie languid on my quivering lip, and my weary eye close on my pale
cheek, until exhausted nature sinking into sleep, I should murmur out
a righteous verdict in my dreams. (Hurrah! in which the waiters in the
robing-room join.)
The above specimens will satisfy those to whom we offer our services,
that we are able to fulfil any contract we may enter into for the supply
of clap-traps to Westminster Hall, should the system commenced in the
present season be continued in the next. º however, those who
are entrusted with the judicial management will be induced to re-con.
sider the subject, and # materials for such re-consideration are to be
found in what we have written, we shall have done good service to the
principal actors, as well as to the public in general, who, though they
have applauded once, might not be disposed to do the same thing
again.
PANCRAS PAUPERS AND POLITICS.
The Westrymen of St. Pancras have come to a resolution granting
the use of several paupers to go about with boards announcing meetin
to promote the re-election of the late Members for Marylebone...We
presume the political opinions of the paupers will be consulted, for it
will be rather hard to make a Conservative pauper carry a Whig
lacard, and thus turn him, into a walking lie, by putting Liberalism on
#. back and stomach, while he may have Chartism, Protectionism, or
some other -ism at his heart. We must confess we do not by any
means see what right the Westrymen have to turn the paupers into dead
walls, and stick bills all over them in the manner proposed. The poor
would, we think, have a right to remonstrate against such treatment:
for, even if they receive º: from the parish, they are not obliged
to have such a description of board thrust upon them as they will, it
seems, be called upon to accept.
The Rains and the Races.
ALL the “great events” have come off in such thorough drenchers
this season, that we question if the year 1852 ought not henceforth, to
be marked in Racing Calendars as being, par ercellence, the Running-
Rain Year.
A NOTE AND A QUERY.
A.Corresponpºst has written us a note asking us why the Queen
“pricks for sheriffs?” We are unable to give the reason, unless it be
that there is such a poor choice as to leave only a pin to choose
between them.

RETROSPECT OF PARLIAMENT.
N
&
| *
ARLIAMENT was four
years and some months
old at the time of its
decease. Within that
time various changes of
more or less importance
have occurred. Changes
of linen, of frequency
varying according to cir-
cumstances and ideas of
| cleanliness, have been
made out of doors, as
well as by those par-
º engaged in the
work of legislation. The
number of suits has been
augmented, not only in
one sense by the conve-
nient extension of County
Courts, but also in another
by the greater facility
afforded to the employ.
ment of tailors, through
the increased cheapness
of material and the general
abundance which have re-
sulted from Free Trade.
An expansive tendency
will have been observed
by most persons about the
middle period of life, to
characterise later mea-
sures, especially round the
waist.
A falling off of the crops
on some of the Crown
lands is to be deplored,
but this is an evil that
cannot be remedied by act
of Parliamznt; and it
would be well if any cure
could be found for the complaint in any of those substances analogous to guano, that are vaunted
as specifics for this natural baldness in terms which may be described as balderdash.
otwithstanding the depression under which Agriculture has, unfortunately, laboured, the inevitable
operation of time, in causing the ſurrow to make its appearance where it was before unknown, will be
discovered by many of us on reference to the ºff. . It may be hoped that the wrinkles we have
got as we have grown older, are not altogether of a physical, nature, but may, in some measure, be
regarded as acquisitions in that knowledge and enlightenment which are, or ought to be, characteristic of
an advancing age. - - -
Surrounded by suppressed but smouldering discontent and rebellion, we have presented a general
aspect of serenity to Europe, and multitudes of individuals among us, in whose aspect at the first
meeting of the defunct Parliament there was nothing particular, may now be regarded by our neighbours
as exhibiting undeniable spectacles. - -
Numerous additions have been made to the domestic happiness of those of HER MAJEsty's subjects
who have entered, before or since the commencement of the º Parliamentary period, into the conjugal
relation. With these legislation may be thought to have little to do; but there is no doubt that the
enlargement of the loaf, and the reduced price of other provisions, have, in many instances
those events augmentations of the happiness of domestic life, which would otherwise
aggravations of its misery.
“HATS OFF, STRANGERs 1
rendered
have been
THE GOLDEN RAGE.
CERTAINLY, if the letters of “our own correspondents” be letters of credit, the affairs of Australia
just now are in what may literally be termed a precious mess...Gold is still the prevailing epidemic,
and we doubt if even the influenza has ever been so popular. The entire colony, it seems, has caught
the infection, and is breaking out in “diggings" everywhere.
Meanwhile, the social sequitur is obvious, of course. Society for the nonce is ºl. topsy-
turvy fied, and the Heads of the people are sinking rapidly beneath the people's feet. Judges, for want
of grooms, are filially wheeled to court in chairs; and shepherds kindly offer to engage their ex-
employers in the capacity of “good plain cook.” Servants in fact, are more than “worth their
weight in gold.” That comparatively is a cheap commodity, and may be had anywhere—for the digging.
But a new servant is procurable for neither love nor money; and should an old one condescend to
stay, he's pretty sure to give himself about as many airs as an opera singer, and to take French leave
of you whenever it may suit him. -
ially considered, therefore, this glut of gold is a positive nuisance: domestically productive of
many a “case of real distress,” and daily adding proof of the proverbial wisdom of the words
“l"embarras des richesses.”
The Best SpeakER.—The reporters call Chisholm ANSTEY “out and out the best Speaker in the
House,” for he no sooner begins to speak than the House is counted out.

PENAL EMPIRICISM.
DePRAvity is a vitiated state of
mind. . Witiated states of mind, often
depend upon disordered conditions
of nervous system. Nevertheless,
if Mr. Punch were to propose to
put an evil-disposed person under a
course of mesmerism and homoeopathy
or , even of regular old-fashione
orthodox blistering, and physicking
for the cure of his bad propensities,
Mr. Punch would probably excite as
much laughter as he has ever done
by the most brilliant remark. -
Yet nobody will laugh on reading
joined brief report under the
the subj
head of “Middlesex Sessions”—
“JAMEs WATson, aged 13, was convicted of
stealing a gold watch and chain, value £12, the
property of EMILY KING, from her person. . .
“The prisoner has been five times in prison
since 1850, and twice whipped, and he was
sentenced to seven years' transportation.”
Imprisoned five times and twice
whipped, in the course of two years
and only thirteen years old ! For all
this treatment, however, the patient
is no better, but, on the contrary,
much worse: and the next prescrip-
tion is transportation for seven years;
Surely this is ridiculous practice, if
the absurdity of any system of
medicine can be inferred from its
Inerncacy.
One would like to know the ante-
cedents of a child who at 13 appears
to be an incorrigible rogue—incor-
rigible, that is, by incarceration and
stripes. Had MastER JAMEs WAT-
SON, º to 1850, been to school
as often as he has been, since then, to
prison? Had he received any en-
couragement to do well as many times
as he has been whipped to deter him
from doing ill? ot having been
sent to any other place of education,
had he resorted to MR. FAGIN's
Academy? What sort of habitation,
in what court, lane, or alley, did young
WATson live in, if he had any home at
all? how was it supplied with water
to relieve him from the irritative and
demoralising influence of dirt P in
what degree was its atmosphere
tainted by exhalations from sewers
and graveyards, corrupting the blood
and, through it, disturbing that cerebra
order whereon right conduct, among
other things, is much dependent *
These evil influences not having
existed in this young gentleman's
case to make him what he is, was he
born so, hereditarily gin-blighted,
dwarfed in the better parts of his
brain? Whipping, imprisonment, and
transportation, will not enlarge the
stunted, convolutions, any more than
they will rectify a congenital club-foot.
Still these are what are called practical
measures, and it is supposed to evince
i. of common sense to question
them.
As It Should Be.
AMONG the “recent additions” to
MADAME Tussaud AND SoNs' cereal
collection, we see announced that of
the ReverEND MR. BENNETT, “late
of St. Barnabas,” but now of Rome.
With a nice propriety, we understand,
the figure of the Reverend Gentleman
is moulded entirely from the runnings
of his favourite Roman candles,

GENTLEMEN'S SEATS TO BE LET.
ME POPPOCK is honoured with instructions to dispose of for
three, five, six, or seven years, as the case may be—a few, that is,
not a few GENTLEMEN's SEATs, in a very populous and, he may add,
very historical neighbourhood. The price of the seats varies from
THE MODEST FIGURE OF £500 To
THE MORE ARIstocratic sum of £6000.
But it is the peculiarity of the sale, that whatever the amount, the
IMPORTANT PRIVILEGES BESTOWED
Are one and the same; the Seat making the Man, not the Man the Seat.
The Neighbourhood is at once busy, solemn, popular and historic.
westMINSTER’s saxon Abbey,
Even some miles off, looms, beautifully in the distance; whilst its
proximity to the GENTLEMEN's SEATs to Be Disposed or, cannot but
excite within the breast of the Patriot “thoughts that do often lie too
deep” for fluent expression. The Gentleman Purchaser may finally
sleep in that Abbey, and—for MR. Poppock's failing is a too unworldly
candour—and he may not.
The statue of GEORGE CANNING,
In its immortal coat of classic verdigris, grasps the Roll of Fame, and
indicates to the Gentleman Purchaser (of one of the Seats aforesaid)
the Pedestal that may lie or loom, which is now the same thing,
before him.

With its many associations of HASTINGs, BURKE, and SHERIDAN, to say

market.

A DISMAL LOOK-OUT FOR PROTECTION.
SoMEBody advertises a glass for the waistcoat pocket, the size of a
walnut, and so powerful, that a person looked at through it may be seen
and known at a distance of a mile and a half. This is an instrument,
which, if it does what it professes, will be invaluable at the ensuing
elections, for there are many of the candidates whom it is very desirable
to know, if not to see, and whom, when known, it will be very proper
to keep at a distance of a mile and a half at least... We *:::::
recommend this glass to the Protectionist voters—if there shoul
happen, to be any—and who will be able possibly to recognise the
something “looming” afar off, according to MR. DisBAELI—which
something is peculiarly adapted to being looked at in the distance, for
it will never get an inch nearer, if it were looked at for twenty years.
The glass is evidently intended for the agricultural interest, for it
professes to show “country scenery at from 12 to 14 miles.” . This is
a hit at the remoteness of agricultural prospects in general, and we
º * doubt the distance alluded to is to be measured as so much
enlind.
SIMPLE SIMONY.
A BALLAD BY CATNACH THE YOUNGER.
Now come, you Bishops all that sit as spiritual peers,
Grant me the temporary loan of your right reverend ears;
To you I will a tale unfold 'tis fitting you should know,
A most gross case related in the Times by S. G. O.
At the end of last November a living vacant fell,
With duties of importance—for endowment pretty well;
ItsFº reckoned at one thousand people near,
And value said to be about six hundred pounds a year.
To give a zealous parson work, the Papists there abound,
And numbers of Dissenters in that parish may be found,
A nunnery, with Popish priests, ..f meeting-houses twain,
The rectory of Spettisbury-with-Charlton doth contain.
The patron is a gentleman of riches and of lands,
Who represents a borough, which is snugly in his hands;
There's a way of selling boroughs so as Bribery Laws to do,
And there are means whereby you may dispose of livings too.
Now when this goodly .# with so many souls to cure,
Fell vacant, most men would conclude 'twas given, to be sure,
Unto some powerful preacher who was equal to the place,
Some able-bodied clergyman, at least, in any case.
A man above fourscore, instead, was named the post to fill,
And instituted—it may be against the bishop's will—
A good old "...ºf gentleman as could be well desired,
But many a year from residence and active work retired.
This wonderful preferment, as doth S. G. O. º
Is nothing but a dodge contrived for lucre and for gain;
Because a vacant living is forbidden to be sold,
The trick is to bestow it on a man infirm and old.
Then its next presentation is a marketable thing,
And the older the incumbent, why of course, the more 'twill bring;
What a very fine distinction do your learned doctors draw,
Between what's simony in fact, and simony in law
Oh! you right reverend fathers in the Upper House, declare,
This scandal having been so long, what business have you there?
Whatever it may be, you seem to let it quite alone,
Can you attend to any who so little mind your own?

PLACARDS FOR PLAIN DEALERS.
Even true Britons will, at election times, march about with placards,
flags, and banners, charged with various mottos and party-words; but
with native common sense they will desire to make such, demonstra-
tional displays as little unmeaning and ridiculous as ible. A few
hints towards rendering these exhibitions the more clearly and truth-
fully significant, will perhaps be acceptable. The Protectionists, there:
fore, particularly as they pride themselves on, being a bluff, above-board
party—should declare their objects explicitly by inscribing on their
standards, “Rent and Taxes!” “Hounds !” Horses " " “Yachting!”
“Places under Government!” “Fat Livings!” “Commissions in
the Army and Navy l’” “Boxes at the Opera !” and so on, with the
list of good things with which Corn Laws and such like statutes re
calculated to endow the aristocracy; whilst the Liberal party might
blazon their colours with the specification of necessaries and comforts
procured for the people by the operatiºn of Free Trade, as “Bread!”
“Beef 1?” “Mutton " “Wealſ " " Ham " “Sugar !” “Teal"
“Coffee : * “Tobacco!” “Snuff I’” “Winegar!” “Pepper!” “Hats!”
“Coats l’” “Trowsers " " “Shirts 1" “Handkerchiefs ' " whereunto
might be added, “Boots and Shoes to the Rescue !”

THE NEW SOUTH-SEA
BUBBLE.
A Body not lightly to be named—
for its title is lºy reading—the
Acting Committee of the National
Association for the Protection of
Industry, and Capital throughout the
British Empire—has issued an address
“To the Protectionists of the United
Kingdom.” Any expenditure of criti-
cism on this document would be super-
fluous, inasmuch as its value, like the
purport of a lady's letter, is mainl
apparent in its postscript, whic
represents it as dated from the South
Sea House. Perhaps people were not
generally aware that Protection is
another South Sea Scheme, although
they may have known well enough that
it |. no better than the imposture so
Called.
Electioneering Harmony.
BANDs of music, consisting of drums
and trumpets, we are informed by the
newspapers, paraded sundry towns at
the late elections. Where this was
not exactly the case, the trumpet was
generally blown on the hustings b
the proprietor of that instrument, an
the drum was for the most part also
very audible ; not the kettle drum, nor
the big drum, but the hum-drum, where-
with the various candidates regaled
the ears of the constituencies to an
unprecedented extent.
A Light from the Altar.
THE Lisbon press—according to the
Post—comments on the indecency of
one of the Minister's friends, who,
accompanying the politician on a visit
to a church, “pulled out a cigar, lit
it at the lamp before the altar, and
commenced smoking it.” We are sorry
to say that we can, in very merry
England, parallel the indecency. How
many among us, ladies included, have
lighted worse things than cigars in
Protestant Churches, and not at lamps,
but at candles? Can MR. BENNETT
himself count the number?

Louis NAPOLEoN has been trying his hand at, a Constitution, and
has fixed upon a very congenial locality for his labours. He has, in
fact, been giving a Constitution to Algeria, and he begins by declaring
that “Frenchmen are to enjºy in Algiers the same civil rights as they
enjoy in their own country.” This is a bit of humour we did not give
louis NAPOLEQN credit for. The civil rights “enjoyed” by the French
may be a very fair subject for a joke; but the idea of putting, Algiers
and Fº on a political equality is rather too near the truth to be quite
agreeable.
THE FIVE SHILLING DUTY.
THIS is the usual fine inflicted at our Police Offices for drunkenness.
We think every Protectionist who expects to see it inflicted must be
also in a similar state, for we cannot imagine any man entertaining any
such absurd proposition in his sober senses.

RUPERT’S RIDE TO THE COUNTRY.
YE, they have gone to the
country; but since
horses first were made,
Sure never was there wit-
ness'd such a motley
cavalcade.
Poets must invoke the
Muses; so I call the
DERBY Mews
To sing those bolters, blind
'uns, roarers, cock-tails,
hacks, and screws.
On a dark horse for the first
time gallant RUPERT
deigns to show ;
Extremely rum to look at,
and by no means good
to go :
His name unknown —his
pedigree, by Protection
out of Sham-
Slow and hard-mouthed like
his sire, and a shier
like his dam.
Dark Dizzy rides beside
him, on a most eccen-
tric steed—
By Place out of Ambition—of Caucasian Arab breed ;
An uncommonly good goer, but so skittish, when he goes,
'Tis a toss-up which is foremost—his tail-piece or his nose.
But, of all the horses ever foal'd, commend me to the screw,
That contrives to carry MALMESBURY, with more than much ado;
By Pis-aller out of Nullity—how pick’d up, I ne'er could learn–
Bad legs, bad head, bad action—bad, in short, from stem to stern.
Mild Walpole jogs alongside, extremely ill at ease;
His nag looks more like going, but is queer about the knees,
By Good Temper out of Common Place; and, spite of RUPERT's frown.
It’s ten to one, the first rough bit, that WALPole's cob comes down.
Cautious and sober, in the rear, with a good hand on the rein,
Rides PakingtoN, whose steed cuts quite a figure in the train;
By Pluck out of old Common Sense, well known for a safe blood,
iſ... thank the line that RUPERT takes, he must stick in the mud.
But who's this preur chevalier, young, graceful, debonnaire?
If Manners ever make the man, why then the man is there.
His steed got by Romance out of Reality, but foaled
In the moyen age—himself too young, and his blood a deal too old.
And what top-booted worthy comes pounding on at speed,
On a rough-legged, big-boned cart-horse, of the real Chowler breed;
By Piy-head out of Slow-coach & 'Tis CHRISTOPHER, misled
By notions of fixed duty, looming very far a-head.
The ruck comes hard behind him: see, tight in his pig-skin,
Sits BERESFORD, in seat and style, type of Ex-Whipper-in;
There's KELLY, tailor-fashion, uneasy in his perch,
And yawing, every now and then, with a most tremendous lurch.
Here come the Treasury º on their leggy lathy weeds,
Of course they’re not worth dwelling on—riders no more than steeds—
Nor the TRoLLOPEs nor the Joliffes—of whom all one can say
Is, they’d better make the best on’t, as they are out for the day.
And now they’re past, from first to last: it is a sorry sight;
Let's hope there’ll be no bones broke before they all alight.
But take them all in all, men and mounts, one cannot doubt,
(Whate'er they may do now) their mothers soon will know they’re out.
Great Forgetfulness.
THE MALMESBURY Motto is “Ubique patrian reminisci.” His
Lordship has a very curious way of acting up to his motto. We
suppose that Tuscany is not included in the “Ubique,” for it is very
clear that in the MATHER business he had a very poor recollection of
his country. Without wishing to be too severe, we may say that LoRD
MALMESBURY not only forgot England, but himself also.
SeasonABLE INTELLIGENCE.-MR, FLEXMoRE gave the “Mantle of

A BALLOON SHOWING ITS AIRS.
THE veteran MRs. GRAHAM was to have ascended in a balloon the
other day for the some-hundred-and-somethingth time, when the balloon,
in a fit of excessive buoyancy, started off without her. After tumbling
about in the air for a considerable time, and reaching an elevation so
unusual, as to make the people below imagine that it, was carrying a
lunatic, and was exemplifying the union of “out of sight” and “out ol
mind,” the balloon seems to have become conscious of the folly of its
own. freak, and to have “split its sides” with an over-painful sense of
the ludicrous. We are glad that the veteran aeronaut remained on
terra firma, so that, the emptiness of these aeronautical exploits was
illustrated in a double sense, without doing any injury to any one.
Purity of Election.
Owing to the general institution of baths and washhouses (which
this periodical has been so instrumental in bringing about), it has been
observed with much pleasure by friends of the people, that the shows
of hands at the different nominations were much more satisfactory this
election than they used to be. . The partial prevalence, however, ol
bribery and corruption has rendered it impossible to say that all con.
stituencies, or Members either, exhibited perfectly clean hands.
LARGE RETURNS AND SMALL PROFITS.
We suspect that many of the
candidates at the elections
have been, consulting the
racing prophets, for scarcely
a man has gone to the poll
who has not declared his own
name as a “certainty” for
the winner. There has pro-
bably been a large amount ol
“Tip” to obtain this very
promising expectation, which
the event has not realised.
No one was so confident of
winning as “ConinghAM for
Westminster,” who not only
declared his intention to be
at the head of the poll, but
was already coquetting with
the premiership in posse, and
paving his way to Downing
Street by refusing to pledge
himself absolutely against
being a member of the Govern-
ment.
We understand he had
already purchased several
pieces of red tape, , with
which he was learning to manipulate, as a sort of introduction to
official experience. He had, it is said, been practising also with a tin
case, which he rapped repeatedly with his knuckles by way of
accustoming himself to the use of an official dispatch-box: He has,
however, received a rap of the knuckles of another kind, from the
electors of Westminster. Having, in imagination, installed himself as
a member of the Cabinet, he will now have to perform, the process of
resignation in the same visionary manner. It is possible that he has
been playing at the Ministerial game of kissing hands for the last
month before his own looking-glass, and he may now amuse himself by
delivering up his seals—unfastening them from his watch;chain, and
passing them from his right hand to his left—as an emblem of his
visionary fall from an ńºf it.

Political Misnomer.
A New order of politicians is ºf . suffrages of the iree and
independent, under the designation of Liberal Conservatives. This is
not a very fortunate title, since it is one that may be most fairly claimed
by the old Tories, who, at election time, used to scatter, guineas an
set taps flowing in behalf of Conservatism with extreme liberality.
THE COOLEST THING.
Does the reader wish to know the coolest thing in this hot weather?
It is the coolness of the Morning Herald, who claims for DeRºy's three
months' administration the increase in the quarter's revenue ! OW
that is so cool, Mrs. Gamp herself might ice small beer with it.

A SERPENT FOR THE POPE'S BRASS BAND.
To the Editor of the Tablet.
UoNDAM FRIEND,--In your paper
of July 3, you attribute the late
riots at Stockport to the Govern-
ment’s proclamation against pa-
pistical processions. Perhaps, if
agentleman accustomed to trail
his coat about at Donnybrook
Fair, daring anybody
to tread upon it,
were warned to dis-
continue a practice
80 º calcu-
lated to provoke a
breach of the peace,
and thereon were in-
continently to repeat
= it and get his head
- - - broken, you would,
in like manner, ascribe his misfortune to the caution which had been given to him,
and not to his contempt thereof.
The language wherein you couch this accusation is so excellent a specimen of
your style, that I must call your attention to it, and ask you whether, if possible
you cannot contrive to write a little more rancrously, maliciously, an
slanderously.
You say
2
“Lond Dºnny and Mr. WALPolk have drawn their first blood at stockport. They have thus done
what they attempted to do... They issued the proclamation against processions, and vestments, º
encourage, at the hazard of bloodshed, the anti-Catholic bigotry which they hoped would bring them
a few more votes at the elections, and the result is what they foresaw and foreknew. It is our belief, |
that never was outrage and murder more deliberately planned than the Stockport outrages and
murders—not, of course, in that exact locality—were planned by Lond Drapy and MR. Walpolk, when
they issued their proclamation against the free exercise of the Catholic religion."
You subsequently repeat your charge of murder against the Ministers, thus:—
“The QUEEN's speech is just received. It is a vile hypocritical document, such as you might
expect from the men whose habitual public acts are speeches that swindle, and proclamations that
shed innocent blood. There is, of course, not a word about bestarved Ireland; but there is some
sanctimonious lying about “religious liberty,’ the true comment upon which is the sack of Stockport.'
In your report of your own address to the electors of Meath, you represent
yourself as telling them:—
“When an English Member of Parliament is returned, he is returned to hate you, because all his
feelings and all his wishes are hostile to your country—he is returned because he is an enemy to your
church (Loud applause). The consequence is, that the whole system of constitutional, or free govern-
ment, which sends members to the House of Commons who ought to be your protectors, is opposed
tº your interests; they despise your people; they slander them; they revile your clergy and nuns, and
they act as if they were your greatest enemies (hear, hear).”
In a previous part of the same speech, you assert that
“.
... we have a Chief Justice in England who hounds on bigoted and ferocious mobs against
everything we hold sacred, and tries to make martyrs out of the beastliest apostates.”
“Beastly,” “brutal,” “ ; : wretches,” are the flowers of speech that you are
accustomed to scatter on, the Protestant English people; you strain yourself to
express, the spite and hatred, with which you burn against them and their
institutions, and you labour to inflame the same passions amongst the Christian
sect, of which your newspaper is one of the chief, if not the most respectable, organs.
Now I suppose you flatter yourself that you annoy us in some manner by this
utterance of malignity;, we are annoyed thereby; but it is desirable that you
should clearly understand how. Did you ever, Quondam Friend, go out shooting on
the Moors on a hot day, and in ranging the heather, come suddenly on a fragment
of blasted rock, and thereon espy a coiled adder? What emotion arose in your
breast on seeing the evil beast rise and hiss, disclosing its nasty poisonous jaws?
Iſ in your case-it was not sympathy with the reptile; if it was the same feeling
º' that wherewith human nature in general regards a loathsome snake; then,
Quondam Friend, it was precisely the sentiment which you excite in our minds by
your envenomed abuse.
It is true that you have not, personally, to apprehend such a visitation as the
adder invites º showing his fangs? We do not—whatever you may pretend—
want to squelch you, or blow you to atoms. If your rancour were to wreak
itself in deeds instead of words, and to reap its legal reward, we should regard
Qur fate with some degree of pity—as we should have contemplated that of Guy
Awkes. We, I say, the mass of Englishmen, look upon your viperine expec-
torations with simple antipathy and disgust. But the untutored populace is
dangerously exasperated by such spiteful outspittings—these, indeed, are the true
º of Stockport riots... If you wish such scenes repeated, you cannot do
tter than, go on with. Fº articulate and legible hissings, howls, and yells, which
the mºb takes, to signify the affection of Roman Catholics towards the rest of
HER MAJESTY's subjects. Go on—you are very aggravating, doubtless—endeavour
to be mºre so. Aggravate your roar, and you will aggravate the roar of " No
Popery!” to something like a thunder-peal; perhaps accompanied by lightning:
ºf which some flashes, indeed, have already been seen—with satisfaction, one might
AN ELECTION ROAR FROM THE BRITISH
LION.
OH, Election time is the time for me,
With its bands and its beef, and its beer so free;
I'm a big beast always, but then, d'ye see,
A bigger beast than ever I be,
With a tooral-looral.
For they lets me loose to ramp and roar,
And they gives me victuals and drink galore,
And the more I calls for, they draws the more,
And I know it aint me as pays the score,
With a tooral-looral.
So I blows my 'bacca and swigs my ale,
And with ribbands I ties my mane and tail,
And backs my opinions without any fail,
Which is always his’n as pays on the nail,
With a tooral-looral.
*Tother times deuce a bit the big-wigs thinks
What I says or does, or eats or drinks;
But then, if I only nods or winks,
I'm as wise as a sarpent, and deep as a Sphynx,
With my tooral-looral.
MRs. LIONess then is a reg’lar saint,
And my cubs is angels and fit to paint,
And all the world through such a Lion there aint,
As the British—and, neither, Is’pose, there baint,
With a tooral-looral.
It's wonderful, then, how the tip-top mobs
With the British Lion hobs and mobs:
*Till there's no such things in the world as mobs,
But enlightened electors instead of snobs,
With our tooral-looral.
So I eats myself hungry, and drinks myself dry,
For I knows what 'twill come to by and bye;
And sometimes I says to myself, on the sly,
They must see a deal o' green in my eye,
With their tooral-looral.
Instead of flattºring and letting me loose,
To swill like a hog and to hiss like a goose,
I fancies a dose of wholesome abuse
To the British Lion might be o' more use
Than their tooral-looral.
If they made me less of a hustings tool,
Didn't call me wise while they think me a fool;
If instead of rousing, my passions they'd rule,
And pack off the poor British Lion to school,
With a tooral-looral.
I'll answer for it, if once they began,
To deal upon this here sort of plan,
That the É. Lion, as fast as he can,
Will grow less of a brute and more of a man,
With a tooral-looral.
Change of Title.
ONE of our sporting “Prophets,” who has made him
self motorious by never prophesying right, has changed his
title. He now calls himself a “Loomer into the Future.”
We doubt strongly, judging of the great prophet (“Sybil,”
rhaps, would be the more correct word), from whom
º: has stolen the designation, whether it will have any
good effect upon his prophecies.
AGRICULTURAL DISTRESS.
This has been on the increase ever since the Elections;
and, since they have gone unfavourably to my LoRD
DeRBY, the distress, as expressed in the farmers’ counte-
nances, has been something terrible to contemplate. A
correspondent, assures us he has conversed, with several
upon the subject, and he has never seen such distressing-.
looking objects in all his life.

First Man of the World. “Heard of Miss F.—'s MARRIAge, CHARLEY tº
PROGRESSIVE POLITICS.
DURING the Metropolitan elections last week, it was impos-
sible to find a cab that was not plastered over with placards,
and converted into a sort of political vehicle. A quiet man
of business could not obtain a shilling ride without pledging
himself during the journey to one or other of the Metro-
olitan candidates, and exposing himself alternately to the
urrahs and the brickbats of those with whom the candidate
was either popular or otherwise. We, ourselves, jumped
accidentally into an omnibus, which we soon found carpeted
with cabbage leaves, and paved with small pieces of granite
thrown in as we passed along, and it was only when we insiste
on getting out of such a disagreeable position that we per-
ceived on the panel a large label, inscribed with the words,
“Plump for Maidstone.” Happily a general election is rare
but if such ceremonies happened once a year, we should call
loudly upon the omnibuses and cabs to remain unpledged, and
to continue “open to all, and influenced by none,” so that the
unpopularity of particular candidates might not be visited on
the heads of innocent town travellers.

A Picture Overdrawn.
A critic, in describing a recently published engraving of a
portrait of Louis NAPQLeon, says," The likeness is very good,
and the position remarkably easy.” Surely this criticism is self-
contradictory, for there cannot be an accurate likeness of Louis
NApoleon, in which his position is represented as an easy one.
If we had been told that the attitude in which he is placed is
extremely awkward, we should have had some faith in the re-

SPECIAL TRAINS FOR A PRETTY SIGHT.
Two brothers, Irishmen, were hanged the other day at Cupar, for
murder-denying, by the way, their guilt to the last, and leaving us in
some doubt whether they have not been gratuitously strangled. A few
days before that on which these men were killed, a handbill was issued,
whereof a copy is here subjoined:—
“EDINBURGH, PERTII, AND DUNDEE RAILWAY.
“SPECIAL NOTICE.
“Several applications have been made for a Special Train at Reduced Rates from
the principal Stations on the Line to Cupar, upon Monday morning the 5th July.
Notice is hereby given that no reduction of Fares will take place on that day, and that
the Regular Trains only will Run from Dundee and Perth. In order to prevent delay
to the first Passenger Train from Edinburgh, a Special Train for Cupar will leave
Burntisland on Monday morning at half-past 6 o'clock, and from Dunfermline at
6 o ºk. These Special Trains will call at all the Intermediate Stations. Fares as
usual.
"A Special Train from Cupar to Burntisland, calling at all the Intermediate Stations,
will leave at half-past 11 o'clock forenoon on Monday,
“Manager's Office, Edinburgh, July 1, 1852.” “By Order.”
We have some fault to find with this document, which in advertising
special trains to see a couple of men hanged, does not show quite so
much taste in the composition of posters as might be expected from an
enterprising company, with views exclusively commercial. It should
have been headed:-UNDER THE PATRonAge of the Legislature,

. Finally, at the foot of the bill, there should have been three asterisks,
signifying that biographies of the culprits—including their last dying
speeches and confessions—and º: of verses were to be had at the
several stations, published by the Company none others to be depended
upon. If you are to make the miserable death of criminals the subject

The real fleecy hosiery of warm benevolence | Flannel and blankets!
Thus, the Lincoln widow may not—might not, we should say—sit, or
walk, or gossip in her door-way, or take a pound of cherries in her
lap-without sensibly acknowledging the woollen goodness of the
CoLONEL: she might not, in the solitary night, upon her lonely couch, if
with only one blanket about her—she might not, we say, at that hour
when meditative souls are given to think of good deeds, apt to escape

donkey ended and where GILEs began; and, in like manner, where was
the commencement of GILEs and the termination of the ass? . GILES
had been so long astride of the beast, that it had become a part of his
flesh and blood; nay, when GILEs opened his mouth to speak, you
might have sworn you heard nothing but an ass. We think the name
of the ass was Lincoln; but, any way, Lincoln, that is, the Donkey—and
GILEs Gubbiss were one. However, to return to the Colonel. ..
He said—“he had heard of bribery and corruption; but he did not
know what they were, unless it was something that came from the
Treasury benches.” . This is an extraordinary coincidence; the friend
and incorporate donkey of GILEs—yes, that unsophisticated ass did not
know thistles from carrots, and on one occasion mistook a peck of oats
for carraway-seeds.
The Colonel vehemently condemned the bran new Bribery Act; and
with his philanthropic gushings, the Colonel has good, benevolent cause
for reprobation of the measure, inasmuch as it was one “that restrained
him from acts of charity, and from the performance of those duties
which, he knew from high authority, were healing the wounds re:
quiring salve, and assisting the poor widow in her tribulation.”
(Loud cheers.)
Colonel, bless you! Bless you and thank you ! That sentence of
yours has-(pooh, pooh, why should we not publish the fact P)—has
touched us; and we feel at this minute one round big tear—big as a
Sugar- ... ºf down our nose, and—there 1–
ump it has fallen upon the paper; and now our pen passes
through it, and the sympathetic dew dilutes and purifies the ink that
chronicles a Colonel's goodness.
Wounds requiring salve—salve for wounds at elections ! What sort
of salve *. Is it patented? Does it require a stamp? Is none genuine
that is not signed “SIBTHQRP”. Qf what is it compounded? Are
any of its ingredients to be found in California? Is it in dust, in scale,
or in nuggets P
But the climax of bounty, the outpouring of irrepressible goodness,
the spirit of pure, disinterested benevolence, is in “assisting the poor
widow in her tribulation.” For we cannot hide from our convictions
the fact that there do exist, evil-minded men, ready to attribute that
t of healing salve to the hope of a gift in return: golden ointment
or a wounded conscience; an auriferous lozenge to clear the voice for
a hustings vote. But the poor widow-meek, ill-used soul—has, it is
well known, no yoice whatever. Widows are, dumb–at least, at
elections." Therefore, any aid in the widow’s tribulation is the aid of
spontaneous goodness; the gum oozing from the tree—the silver-
threaded stream running, because it cannot help it, from the rock.
The widow in her tribulation | What an election picture is this
e have understood that the frequent gifts of the Colonel are flannel
and blankets. Like the simple sheep of Colchis, SIBTHORP shines in wool.

“Flow on, thou Shining.”
SoME people have accused LoRD MAIDSTONE of talking about that
which he does not understand when he anticipated a post-DERBYITE
Deluge. The electors of Westminster have, however, enlightened the
poetical Wiscount in some degree, for they have astonished him with
such a flood of cold water, as may give him some notion of a deluge in
miniature.

THERE is great talk at present in France about the Orleanists and
Legitimists clubbing their claims and charces together to the next
occupancy of that very uncomfortable seat...rue Throne of France.
They are spoken of as the “FUSIONISTs.” We suppose this term is
given to distinguish them from the Bonapartists, who are well known
to be “THE CONFUSIONISTs.”
UNCONSTITUTIONAL TEMPERATURE.
The weather was so hot last week, that serious fears, were enter-
tained that the New Parliament would be dissolved as fast as it was
constituted.
Oxford Honours-ID. C. L.
WE have it on newspaper report, that Oxford, following a late

THE CANDIDATE'S CATECHISM,
AND HOW TO ANSWER IT.
PARLIAMENT having passed that very impertinent measure, the
Corrupt Practices at Elections Act, it becomes MR, PUNCH's duty, as
ardian of the British Constitution—a duty, which he fulfils as the
oRD ChancELLOR does that of guardian of all lunatics—to point out
how the yoſhion. of this objectionable and inquisitorial Law may best
be evaded. -
The Act ought to be called the Member's manual for the confessional.
It is obviously the work of a set of regular Parliamentary PETER
DENses. It suggests the most monstrous offences to innocent M.P.'s
who have hitherto put their hands into their breeches pockets an
forked out “the regular expenses” without asking any questions.
After the publication of this abominably suggestive list of interroga-
tories, we shall never see such a thing as a mind of virgin verdure in
the House again. Jacob BELL, in fact, will cease to exist. There is
only one way to neutralise the poison. This is to show how impertinent
questions may be safely answered by any Member without committin
himself, or getting his agents committed. The following examples wi
illustrate our meaning.
Q. Who were your agents at the election?
A. All the friends of the British Constitution in the Borough.
Q. Will you swear that A. was not your agent *
A. The law never calls on a man to prove a negative. It should not,
therefore, insist on his swearing what he cannot be called upon to
prove. N. B. Ali particulars as to acquaintance and connexion with A.
will be inquired into; e.g.—
% P. jº not invite A. to dine with you at the Reform Club P
. 1 011
Q. At your expense F

he should do so. But the waiter informed me this was prohibited by
the rules of the Club. -
l % Hw. you not repeatedly complimented MRs. A. on her good
Oo
A. As a man of honour I decline to answer the question, and in so
doing throw myself on the sympathy of the Committee;
Q. Have you not been in the habit of kissing the little A.’s P
A. My fondness for children is notorious.
Q. Will you swear that you never spoke to or communicated, with
any of your Committee during the Election, or during the immediately
preceding º: ? -
A. I may have conversed with some of them on the weather, and I
have yet to learn that this is a crime.
Q. How did łº, happen to stand for the Borough *
A. Because I wished to sit for it; and standing for it became a
necessary preliminary. - -
Q. With whom did you communicate on the subject before agreeing
to stand?
A. With my wife. -
Q. Was anything, and what, said about the expenses?
A. She observed I º to know better than fool money away, in
such nonsense, particularly after finding fault with her milliner's bill
only the week before.
Q. How much did you undertake to give or to answer for?
A. I undertook to give satisfaction to my constituents, and to answer
any questions I might be asked. -
Did you make any promise before the Election?
A. I promised to do everything that everybody wanted-after I got
into Parliament.
Q. Did any person, and, who, on your behalf, communicate with
persons having interest in the Borough
A. My Committee communicated with every voter of principle, and I
conceive persons with principle ought to be persons with interest.
Q. What passed between you and those persons before such commu-
nications?
A. The usual remarks upon the weather.
Q. How much did you suppose the legal expenses to be?
A. I have always understood that no safe calculations can be made
as to the amount of legal expenses till you have seen the attorney's
bill, and I have not yet seen mine.—N.B. All the details of the alleged
expenses will then be minutely gone into; e.g.—

4. I should certainly suppose that wholesome beer is in harmony
with the British Constitution.
Q. Do you consider 500 yards of blue ribbon legal expenses?
4. My motto being “measures, not men,” I do not think the quantity
excessive.
Q. Do you consider twelve prizefighters legal expenses?
4. I was, informed, they were required to keep the peace, which I
conceive to be a strictly legal object.
Q. Do you not believe that you will have to pay more money after
the Election is over?
4. I am in the hands of my lawyer, so that I think it extremely
probable.
If these answers be carefully studied, and their principle acted upon,
we cannot conceive that any honourable Member will find himself
coerced by this abominable Act into saying anything more than he finds
perfectly agreeable, which will probably in the long run be found the
result most agreeable to all parties.
Q. Do you consider ten barrels of beer to be legal expenses?

FLOOD OF ELOQUENCE.
- According to LoRD MAIDstone, the

- was to have been immediately
followed by a Deluge—a poetical
mode of expressing the idea, that
under the magnificent figure of

find their level. Finding the
Deluge did not go down—with
the public, at any rate-Loºp
MAIdstone lighted the fire of his
imagination, and thought he had
accomplished a “blaze of tri-
umph" by suggesting Vesuvius
as the only possible successor to
the DERby Ministry. We can't
retend to say whether the ºld
g. Zoological model of We:
suvius is still in existence, and
at the disposal of Loºp MAID:
stone to carry out his grand
politico-panoramic idea; but we
must say that we think the mock
lava of the mimic mountain might be an improvement on the unmeaning
palaver of the pseudo-Protectionist Ministry. Perhaps, as . LORD
Maidstone is advertising Wesuvius as the necessary aſterpiece tº
follow the farce that is now fºg. it may be worth the while of
the enterprising manager of the Surrey Zoological Gardens, to have
his popular piece of pyrotechny ready for revival on the conclusion of

THE REVOLVING MAN.
THE public of New York are just now running
after an individual who is exhibited under the title
of the “Revolving Man.” We really see nothing so
surprising, after all, in a Reyolving , for we have
had several specimens at the recent elections, and,
indeed, we have for some time been accustomed to
the rather curious spectacle of a Revolving Minister.
The American Revolving Man goes round so fast
that it is impossible to distinguish the colour of his
dress—a fact that coincides curiously with the phe-
nomenon presented by our “Revolving Minister,”
whose colours are not to be discerned on account of
his rotatory movement. The American Revolving
Man has been compared to a humming-top, and it is
remarkable that an aptitude for “humming” as well
as for turning round, has been for some time one of
the characteristics of our “Revolving Minister.”

PROVINCIAL FANCY.
Lively little Affair at Tiverton, between old PAM, alias the Bottle-holder,
and RowcLIFFE, the Tiverton Yokel.
Consiper ABLE interest has for some time past attended the move-
ments of old PAM, the Downing-street veteran, especially, since his
retirement from the Family Crib, in consequence of his tiff with johnny
Russell, who has since, himself, given up the house to the DERby Pet,
having been driven to this step, in a great degree, by the disgust of his
patrons at his treatment of the judicious #j.
Since his quarrel with John Ny old PAM has remained on the quiet,
declining, it is said, repeated offers to make matches, and, though much
pressed by DERby to take the chair at the Foreign Harmonic Ordinary,
now very inadequately filled º (who got such a thorough
F.; the other day from MATHER, the Shields Rough), PAM has
itherto very wisely held back. . It is thought by many of his friends
that he contemplates taking the house himself, should DeRBY find it too
many for him, which most people think it is.
Under these circumstances the Fancy were naturally all agog to witness
the little mill that has just come off at Tiverton between the veteran
Bottle-holder and one RowcLIFFE—a performer not known in the
I.ondon P. R., but about whom his local backers bounced uncommonly.
His challenge to PAM, we must own, took us by surprise, and so we
fancy it did the veteran himself.
The affair came off on Wednesday week, and a strong muster of the
Provincial Fancy attended.
PAM was attended by GeoRGEY HEATHcore, while a couple of Pro-
vincial great unknowns did the needful for RowcLIFFE. On the men
stripping, PAM's fine condition was apparent. Notwithstanding his
advanced age, he peeled as clean as a star and appeared as gamesome as
; chaſing is friends in a style that showed thorough contempt
1S Inan.
Round 1.--Rowclirrº came up very serious; PAM took his ground
laughing. . After a little dodging, Rowcliffe went in, evidently
meaning mischief, and led off with his right, but was stopped by PAM,
who shook his head smiling, and drop f his hands, as #### to
punish his man. RowcLIFFE, nettled at this, rushed in rather wild
with a one, two, when PAM countered sharply on his mob, and
Rowcliffe went down heavily. First blood for PAM, (Tremendous
cheers for the Bottle-holder, who walked contemptuously to his corner,
pointing with his thumb over his left shoulder.)
Round 2–Rowcliffe came up considerably, queered, by PAM's
right-hand visitation, but still game. After a wild hit or two, which
Fºy dodged in his peculiarly meat, and easy manner, RowcLIFFE,
clearly intending mischief, shot straight out with his left at PAM's
ribs, but was met by the .. veteran, who in return administered
a singer on the knowledge box, and then, apparently determined
to finish his man right off, followed up this with one, twº, on the body,
and the same to follow, in a style that RowcLIFFE had clearly not been
used to, in this way he walked his man round the ring, hitting him
where he fiked; Rowcliffe still standing up and taking his punish-
ment like a glutton, and now and then attempting a return, but never
getting home, till PAM, after thus playing with his opponent like a cat
With a mouse for some moments, drew his left and, sent Rowcliffe to
grass with a rum’un on the right cheek, from which he could not come
to time; and PAM was accordingly proclaimed the victor, without a hit
or a scratch, after two rounds, only occupying about ten minutes.
Rowcliffe evidently º!. it very heavily about the head and ears,
though those who do not know PAM's meat style of punishment might
have fancied he had been hitting light.
Remarks,—To draw any º between these men would be
ridiculous. From their .. eir ground, it was all Lombard Street
to a China orange. Nothing but the most foolish presumptiºn, ºn the
part of Rowcliffe and his backers could have prompted him to
challenge the veteran Bottle-holder. - - -
ld as PAM is, he is still a match for anything in the ring. He was
in capital spirits, and clearly enjoyed his easy triumph, keeping the
spectators in a roar the whole time. He appeared to treat the affair
as a glove fight, and so it was for him. Probably Rowcliff; thinks it
no joke, all the same. The veteran may be shortly expected in town,
* is old cribin Carlton Terrace, when he will be happy to meet his
friends and patrons as usual.

MATRIMONIAL BIOLOGY.
HIS is a famous science,
but requires very great
skill to practise it. The
husband tries it on upon
the wiſe, or else the wife
(for women generally are
more clever at “trying it
on”) tries it on the hus:
band. In either case, it
is extremely amusing,
and rarely fails of suc-
cess. The quiet way in
which the person who is
under the influence of
the other is persuaded
out of his senses, affords
the greatest amusement
— amusement not un-
º, mixed with instruction to
those who are looking on.
We will illustrate this
science with a few familiar
examples.
MR. Jones is a highly
! successful matrimonial
ºf Biologist. His wife is
º º susceptible—pain-
fully so. She is ex-
.# weak, and does
! everything that Jones
bids her to do. She be-
lieves every word he says,
and will say anything
that Jones commands
her to say. If Jones
tells her to say he came
home last night at twelve
o'clock, or that the moon
is made of green cheese,
or any other likely im-
probability, MRs. Jones will say so at once. No matter how many may be present, the wonderful control
over her smallest actions is just the same. In fact, if there is a large company assisting at the matrimonial
séance, the complete submission to the husband's will is frequently only the more strongly developed.
These phenomena, are not always produced by the communication of metal—though of course the
exhibition of it on the husband's part has its due effect. In truth, the more mettle the husband
generally shows, the quicker the change in his wife's disposition.
But sometimes a small pressure will work the same change.
He declares his shirt is not properly washed. MRs. Jones declares it is. , Jones contends it isn't.
MRs. Jones maintains it is. This continues for two or three minutes. At last, Jones rushes to his
wiſe, seizes her by the wrist, and *:::: it rather tighter than usual, challenges her to look at him.
This is done, when Jones says, still holding her by the wrist, “How can you look at me, Madam, and
say this shirt is properly washed?” There is no reply, but the eyelids drop, and the whole frame
slightly quivers. Jones follows up his advantage, and still staring at her rather scowlingly in the face,
shouts, loud enough for the buoy at the Nore to hear him: “I defy you, Madam, to say this shirt is
properly washed!” The wife sinks down on a chair, covers her face with her hands, and, try as she
will, finds that she cannot say it / The success of the experiment is complete!
At other times, the two opposite (or rather, opposing) parties, are put en rapport by, a pressure upon
the foot. We will suppose they are at dinner. A . friends are invited to partake of it. Jones
recommends his “dear AlpenMAN SPoon” to try the venison, “Venison' my dear?” exclaims the
simple wiſe, “it’s mutting.” “Perhaps you will tell me next, Madam, I don't know venison when I see
it?” “No, John, dear, you make a mistake, I tell you, it’s mutting-I º it myself.” “How can
you quietly sit there, Madam.” (here he pinches }. foot under the table,) “and gravely !" it’s
mutton P.. I tell you it's venison, and it’s the finest haunch I’ve seen for a long time; and I defy
you, Madam,” (here the pinches upon the foot become harder and harder, until at las; there is a slight
jerk of the body, as if a corn had been touched,) “yes, I :#; Madam, to say again that it is
mutton.”. The knife and fork are dropped; a cambric handkerchief is raised to the lady's eyes, and an
interminable silence of five minutes, only relieved by ALDERMAN Spoon's taking snuff, is the most
flattering testimony of the complete success of this interesting biological experiment.
On the other side, the experiments are not always so successful. usbands generally are not so
susceptible as wives. They require more delicate treatment. The passes, whether under the table or
not, must be conducted upon a much more gentle footing. Brow-beating has no effect whatever, for
a husband may be told over and over again by his wife to “look her in the face,” but it is extremely
rare to meet with one who has the courage to do it, as long as she continues in a passion.
. But we have met with some pleasing cases to the contrary, as, for example, MR. Dovº is a little
diminutive man, with scarcely sufficient energy to cry out “Stop!” to an omnibus. MRs, Dove is
tall and commanding, especially commanding as regards poor Dove. She can do...what she likes with
him-making him sing, dance, run, fetch and carry, just as she pleases. He hasn't the will to resist,
and, when he has, his will is easily conquered by his wife’s “Shall.”
Her system of Biology is very simple. It consists of a frown first, and a pinch, afterwards... If he
happens to be blind to the one, he is never insensible to the other. He is pinched into subjection
immediately. In fact, the amount of electricity which there is in a wife's pinch has never been yet
properly estimated,

%.
sº § ~
For instance, Jones is dressing.
MRs. Dove's age is only known by
the family Bible and herself, but she is
naturally anxious to appear as young
as possible. For this purpose, her
daughter's age is always lowered some
four or five years, in order that her own
may benefit by the fall. Thus she
says, “Julia is very advanced—you
wouldn't imagineshe was only twelve?”
“I should think not,” exclaims poor
Dove. ”when she will be sixteen next
birthday, if she’s a day.” Now,
HENRY, dear,” and she frowns at him
and then takes hold of his sleeve. “You
know better than that.” “No, I don't.”
“Yes, you do, dear, you know she’s
only twelve,” (slight pinch,) “in fact,
she’s scarcely twelve,” (two or three
more pinches to silence his rising ob-
jections;) “come, don't try to run
away, HENRY, but say she's twelve-
and not sixteen — there's a dear.”
HENRY says as he is wanted, and
would have said she was only two to
get his arm away.
MRs. Dove goes to a dinner party
(she tells the people) in a fly, but
HENRY bluntly says it was an omnibus,
and declares he can prove it, when
suddenly he recollects (at a pinch) that
it was a fly.
In the same way he cannot see the
beauty of a baby that is being handed
round for admiration, and openly says
as much, but all at once his arm is
seen to fly upwards, and he vows “it’s
the sweetest little thing he has seen
for a long time.”
Again, he hates dancing:-No, he
won't dance, not even to please his
dear little wifey—but it is in vain his
holding out—He must dance—No, he
won’t: when he feels several smart
shocks down his elbow—and, strangely
enough, he dances for a whole hout
against his will.
This same absence of will is evi-
denced in all his actions. He holds
skeins of silk, without being able to
stir from the spot; he reads aloud
until he can scarcely see, but for
the life of him daren't close the book;
he is dragged about all day from shop
to shop, and, much as he wishes to
run home, his legs refuse to carry
him anywhere but after his wife. The
Biological influence is complete.
Instances might be multiplied with
a tedious facility, but we think we
have adduced sufficient to prove the
magical control the husband some-
times exercises over the actions
movements, and almost º of
his wife, making her repeatedly say
and do the very opposite of what she
intended; and the absolute command
which the wife occasionally gains over
her husband, making him a passive
instrument in her hands, to turn or
twist to any purpose she pleases.
Some very entertaining experiments
are frequently made by placing in the
palm of the wife's hand a piece of
metal, not unlike a sovereign. On
such occasions, the wildest exhibitions
will take place, the patient being sud.
denly moved to tears, or frantic joy,
according to the prevailing humour
she may be in; but such experiments
are extremely dangerous, for it is al-
ways an operation of the utmost nicety,
if not of the greatest impossibility, to
; *: sovereign out of the wife's
an
when once the husband has
parted with it.

een a little too urgent; appealing to “the sense of the people,”
through the people's heads, in a manner that makes John BULL apt to

minster by “plumpers;” that is, if the police might vote as they laid

INSENSIBILITY TO FAMINE.
The RE, are many people who do not know, when they have had
enough; but, according to SIR FitzRoy Kelly, there are also many-so
many as to include the majority of HER MAJESTY's subjects—who
cannot tell when they have had too, little. , Lond DeRºy's Solicitor-
General has made this discovery, and imparted the new-found truth to
his constituents of East Suffolk, whom he is reported to have thus
addressed at the hustings:
“It has been said that upwards of 3,000,000 quarters of wheat more were imported
in 1850 and 1851 than in 1845 and 1846, before the repeal of the Corn Laws took place.
. . . while I admitted, as I do now, the truth of the fact that there was this
increase in the importation, Iventure to assert that the food, the comforts and enjoy-
ments of the people have been in no wise increased, have not, taking them as a mass,
been increased at all; for if 8,000,000 more quarters have been imported, 3,000,000
quarters less have been produced in this country.”
The people at large, before the repeal of the Bread Tax, were
certainly not quite in the perfect fruition of food, comforts, and luxuries.
These good things, according to SIR FITzRoy KELLY, have since in no
wise increased. Therefore they have diminished: for the population
has gone on increasing. But the vulgar cry is still “Hooray for Cheap
Bread!” which, as your friend EucLID would say, is absurd. Not
absurd, if cheap bread means abundance: absurd, ridiculous, pre-
posterous, if it means scarcity, as it does if we are to believe SIR
FitzRoy KELLY.
So much corn has been imported, so much less has been grown, so
many more mouths to feed, so much less bread for each: that is the
case of our learned friend. Well: suppose we have not eaten sovery
much more bread than we used to eat. May not Sia FitzRoy KELLY
find an explanation of this circumstance in the fact that we have eaten
more meat? Bread is not the only article of food werejoice in. Avery
general opinion prevails that FreeTrade has enlarged our dietary alto-
gether; so that the masses are not so restricted as they were to bread-
dinners. Most of us go about under an idea that we have partaken, in
additional measure, of beef, mutton, veal, and lamb: but this, the
Solicitor-GENERAL will perhaps tellus, is an illusion. Now is it not
the fact, that he has himself been studying electro-biology, and trying
to impress the susceptible subjects of East Suffolk with a fancy that a
bellyfull is short-commons?
But if Free Trade is a delusion, why should the Derbyites seek to un-
deceive us? How cruel of them to disturb our blessed hallucination!
If we imagine we have a Lotus in the big loaf, humour the national
mania, allow us to continue in the enjoyment of it: if we are crazy,
nevertheless you see it keeps us quiet.
Newport against Rimini.
At Newport the other day, the papers relate, the ceiling of a large
room fell in upon four hundred Mormonites, not one of whom was hurt.
The Latter Day Saints, say it was a miracle they all escaped; other
persons, who pretend to be saints, would declare it a miracle if any of
them had been killed; but no doubt the wonder above mentioned is as
good a miracle as can be boasted of by any Saint of the Latter Day-
whether Januarius or Joe SMITH,

Golden Prospects.
Owing to the expected influx of gold from Australia, it is reported
in the best informed circles that Gold Stick will ultimately have his
wand of office composed of the precious metal...That metal, however,
will be less precious than it is at present; and the rise.in comparative
value of the secondary metallic substance, will render it, by and by, a
much more fortunate lot than it is even now, to be born with a silver
spoon in one's mouth.

THE DERby Firm appears likely to re-open shop after the election,

Papal Fireworks,
The Irish Priests have been, at the late election, evincing their politico-
pyrotechnical abilities in the composition of squibs, or rather Roman
sandles, after a receipt in which sulphur strongly predominates, and
which, from their extremely incendiary qualities, may be regarded as
somewhat more than mere fireworks, if not approaching to the nature
of infernal machines.

HINTS TO YOUNG YACHTSMEN.
S the yachting season has com-
menced its brilliant course, it
becomes, Mr. P.'s duty to give
a fillip to the aspirations of
young yachtsmen. If every one
of them who has ears, will onl
hear—Mr. P. promises himself
no ordinary moral influence.
I will suppose you, my good
young boy, to be a promising
youth of some four-and-twenty,
desirous of being “somebody,’
which is your honourable Eng-
lish ambition. You are a man
of means. Your papa has a
house a little to the east of
Gower Street, and is not disin-
clined to a little extravagance
on your part, provided it be “on
the square” (to use your own
expression), and indulged in re-
spectable company. You wish
to make for yourself a set. You
are right, then, in joining your-
self to some distinct section of
the jº. World, where
nothing will be expected of you
but good-nature and right con-
duct to your fellows, and suffi-
cient means. The last is your
governor's business, and I would
- - - advise you to leave it to him.
To find the means being his peculiar department, don't you interfere with it, by trying it on
elsewhere. You may be tempted to do so by being shy about an application to him,
occasionally, But, be cautious. The myth (look out that word) of the Wandering Jew too
closely, typifies the restless activity of the great Hebrew intellect. Many a pleasant fellow's
º life has been spoiled by the infusion of the “Semitic element” (see Life of BENTINck).
erhaps, after all, the sea is the best field—if it can be called a field –for your young
ambition. You were born for the water, you say. So are the swans. So also is another
class of birds—but pass that by. You are bent on being a Yachtsman... Well, I don't blame
you for the ambition. You are too old to enter, the Navy. And, if you were not, your
worthy father's opinions are very liberal. He wouldn’t get an appointment from the present
people, I can tell you!
ſou have bought the Bubble, and you have been elected into the Argonaut Club, after
a little manoeuvring. You were opposed, first of all, by the machinations of Fitz-GFFAL,
whom you sulkily describe as a “used-up exclusive swell.” I don’t applaud Fitz-O. I agree
with you, that it is wonderful how he manages to keep the flag (which I implore you not
to call a “bit of bunting”) flying in the Diddler. I can give no satisfactory explanation of
his leaving the Heavy Baboons after the Derby of 184–; and I wish I knew the details of

outside the Isle of Wight. . But never mind him; he has not hindered your getting in, an

cºrners of billiard-rooms at Cowes, or elsewhere, and sneer at the Committee. Don't be
ways niggling at the Regulations, or making absurd animadversions on the rules relating
to the starboard tack giving way, &c.
In fact, let me first of all warn you not to begin by being too nautical. Rome—HUDson's
house at Albert Gate—were neither of them "built in a day. You can't make a name
in a day: ºxcept such a temporary name as you could make by sowing mustard and cress in
the form of letters in a garden, which ..". up and passes away before you can say JACK
Robinson. Once, in these pages, I had occasion to reprimand a youth who startled a whole
company of men, by saying that no square-rigged man could sail a fore-and-after. This was in
the London in º when I was visiting the dockyards officially, with the excellent
Sir Thunper Bomb, K.G. B., and the effect is still fresh in my remembrance. There were
many naval men there, when this dogma fell from the lips of Gosling (of the firm of Flopp
AND Gosling). The poor boy never could get over the effect of his speech, and has since
married a widow with money, and taken to farming. Be slow, my son, to ſay down great
general principles. Be long before you affect the very familiar use of nautical phrases. I
would rather hear you §". “ studding-sails”—giving “studding” its two syllables
in full-than hear you glibly talking of “stun-sails,” and confusing them hopelessly with the
flying jib, I would prefer that you should, on visiting a man-of-war, s deliberately of
the “fore-castle,” than that you should saucily bring out "fokesal,” like an old boatswain,
when you could scarcely discriminate between its position and that of the poop! I have
been informed that when LORD MUDDLE visits ships officially, he has been known to mistake
the binnacle for the jolly-boat, but remember that you are not a Lord of the Admiralty, and
that no such ignorance will be excused in you.
Long Vacation.
A PROMISING young Solicitor of Carey Street intends going to Prussia, to be present

a few notions as to Sharp Practice,
STARWED OUT BARRISTERS.
WE understand that MEssRs. BRIEFLEss and
DUNUP have sent in claims to compensation, for
the loss they will sustain by the abolition of
the practice of requiring “Counsel's signature”
to the pleadings in the êº of Common Law.
MR. BRIEFLEss declares that this arrangement
will not only take the bread out of his mouth,
but the cheese out of his pan, and the tea out
of his caddy, MR. DUNUP has prepared a long
constitutional argument to show that the signing
of a plea by counsel ought to be a sine qué non,
and that the legislature, in taking from him his
“good name,” which will henceforth be good for
nothing even when connected with that “stamp
of authority”—a bill stamp, will be depriving
him of that which has been literally his sole
reliance, for it was relied upon by nobody else.
He proceeds in a spirit of learned melancholy
to deplore, as one of the worst signs of the
times, the abolition of the signing of pleas
by barristers, and he expresses a fear that he
shall soon have to affix his name to a “Bill of
Reviver,” as nothing but a bill to a large
amount can revive his drooping fortunes.
MR. BRIEFLess descants rather touchingly ".
the reckless hand of innovation which has
prevented him from º a valuable name
to his children (should he ever happen to have
any), and he, is busily engaged in making his
possible family, a plea, under the head of the
‘general issue,” which he trusts will reach the
heart of what he says ought to be a paternal
Government. In allusion to his little fees—the
: fees he ever received—he quotes passion-
ately the language of MACDUFF as to the sum-
mary treatment of “all his little ones”—his
precious little half-guineas—which have been
cut off at “one fell swoop;” and, indeed, it is
to be feared that the effect on the mind as well
as on the larder of the learned gent. will be
truly deplorable. There has been some talk of a
subscription, which it is said will be headed by
the laundress, who has offered to impale on
the shrine of benevolence the amount of her

STARTLING EFFECT OF THE GOLD “DIGGINS.”

A SERMON FOR DOGS.
THE dogs of Constantinople are among the most interesting creatures
of that most famous city. It requires a sharp look-out on the part of
the isºlº, not to be attacked and devoured by them; but that
is little. There they are, in their dirt, and mange, and mastiness-the
pets of the pious Mussulman who harbours and comforts them,
However, the spirit of liberalism—the spirit that has killed the
merriment of once merry England, making us a hard-dealing, cotton-
spinning, dear-selling, cheap-buying nation; the spirit that, according
to the Imaums who preach from the minarets of the Herald and the
Post, has caused to be thrown out of cultivation thousands and
tens of thousands of acres of land that was wont to be rich and
smiling with golden corn—every grain of which now comes from the
foreigner—the British farmer in his recklessness growing nothing but
groundsel and poppies; that spirit that, forcing its way to Stamboul,
has plucked the solemn turban from the head of the Turk, clapping in
its stead the fez woven and imported from unbelieving Leeds; the
spirit of innovation that has torn the wide-flowing robe and the volu-
minous bag-like trousers from the majestic Mussulman, and now
buttons him tight up to the throat, and thrusts his legs in shameless
trousers; that spirit has been busy among the time-hallowed dogs of
iºl-u. curs almost sacred in their vested rights of food and
Odging.
A short time ago—says the Globe—the number of dogs in Constanti-
nople was so great, that three thousand of them—many of them, no
doubt, torn from their nearest and dearest friends, with no more tender-
ness shewn towards them than a Virginian slave-merchant exhibits
towards his two-legged chattels—three thousand of them were conveyed
to an isle of the Bosphorus, with provision to last three days (...On the
fourth day, the Imaums ascended the minarets, and exhorted the dogs
to patience and resignation!
Do we take this story as the º: relation of a grave fact? Not we.
No: no; the editor of the Globe is an incorrigible wag; and has only
invented the tale as an illustration—another waggery—of the condition
of #. º thousand Protectionists (if there be so many ?) at present
in England.
But iet us assume this dogs' tale to be a true tale; what was the
STANZAS TO PALE ALE.
OH ! I have loved thee fondly, ever
Preferr'd thee to the choicest wine;
From thee my lips they could not sever
By saying thou contain'dst strychnine.
Did I believe the slander P Never!
I held thee still to be divine.
For me thy colour hath a charm,
Although 'tis true º call thee Pale;
And be thou cold when I am warm,
As late I’ve been—so high the scale
Of FAHRENHEIt—and febrile harm
Allay, refrigerating Ale!
How sweet thou art l—yet bitter, too;
And sparkling, like satiric fun;
But how much better thee to brew,
Than a conundrum or a pun,
It is, in every point of view,
Must be allow'd by every one.

Light, airy child of malt and hops

Una Voce Poco Fa.
THE other day, LoRD MAIDstone on coming forward to
thank the Westminster electors for having thrown him out,
or rather refused to let him in—though he would have let them
in if they had done otherwise—declared that he was unable
to say anything, as he had “lost his voice.” Now, as a thing
cannot be lost until it has been found, and as we never heard
that Ioblo MAIDstone poss ssed a voice in Westminster, we
do not see how he can have lost it there. Of course, as
he had nothing to say on the hustings when the result of the
poll was declared, he could only be regarded as a “mute”
assisting at the funeral obsequies of Protection in Covent
| Garden Market.
true peroration of the Imaums' sermon to the dogs? Why, the very
sermon that those Imaums of Manchester, CoBDEN and BRight, in their
sarcastic hard-heartedness preach from their minarets, the tall chimneys
of Cottonopolis.
Consider those hapless, undone dogs, the English farmers. Their
cries—to any other ears, save ears filled with cotton-balls—are terrible.
They have expended all their capital: for more than three years—poor
dogs!—they have existed upon that; and now do the 3.
schoolmen—the elders of the Manchester Jacobin Club, as NAPoleon
DisRAELI so . calls them—now do they, in their hard-hearted
sarcastic manner preach, as the Imaums preached to the ousted dogs
of Constantinople—“patience and resignation.”
But there is a term, an end to patience and resignation. “We have
eaten our three days’ food—(lived on our principal for three years)”
—howl the dogs; “and we are starving—starving !”
And then Imaum Cobden ascends the tall brick chimney; and after
crying “Allah, Bismallah: there is but one Manchester, and Cotton is
its profit,” then does CoBDEN preach to the famishing multitude; and
his peroration is of these few words:–
“Dogs, EAT on E ANother l’”
There. Punch, in the handsomest manner makes a present of this
illustration to SIR FitzRoy KELLy, Solicitor-General for the Corn
Laws. The thing is as false and as bad as it can be; but therefore
carries with it the best recommendation for SIR FitzRoy; for is he
not a man who would bleach a blackamoor into an Albino, and turn the
soot of even a Manchester chimney into Alpine snow * or, if the thing
were put in his Government brief—by his very mode of handling it,
change Alpine snow into cotton-chimney soot?
Sister Seats of Learning.
SHOULD an inquiry respecting the º of tuition pursued at
Maynooth take place next session, its results will perhaps be interesting,
as compared with those that may be elicited by the University Com-
mission. They will probably show that there is no more objection to
the endowment of Maynooth than there would be to a grant to Oxford:
and that a graduate of the latter seat of learning and Puseyism is ad-
missible ad eundem at the former.

AN ECONOMICAL ESTABLISHMENT FOR YOUNG
GENTLEMEN.
HERE is a . general demand for
the repeal of the taxes ou knowledge,
which article, however heavily burdened
with taxation, is not altogether so dear
as people commonly suppose. At least
there is a locality in the north of
England, wherein knowledge appears
to be obtainable on terms which, if
not reasonable, are unreasonable only
from being absurdly cheap. An adver-
tisement in the Times announces, that
at a certain gentleman’s “Academy.”
near Richmond, Yorkshire–
OUTHS ARE BOARDED, Furnished
with Books, and INSTRUCTED in what-
ever their future prospects may require, for 20
and 22 guineas a year. No vacations unless
desired. Cards, with references, to be had by
return of post, and — — will call upon
applicants, after the 11th, in London.
To be sure, there is a certain ambi-
guity in this advertisement. When it
states the terms for board, books, and
instruction, unconditionally, in whatever the pupil's future prospects
may require, at 20 and 22 guineas a year, we are in doubt whether it
means 20 + 22 guineas, or twenty guineas for one class of students or
course of teaching, and twenty-two for another. As the future prospects
of some pupils may require instruction, in omni scibili, the more pro-
bable conjecture should seem to be that 42 guineas are intended;
though in that case the figure might as well have been stated at once,
But forty-two guineas would be cheap for a curriculum which would
possibly include the rudiments of the ancient and modern languages, of
mathematics, pure and mixed, and of the moral and physical sciences.
If from 20 to 22 guineas be what is meant, we can only say that such
a price for a year's food for both mind and body is a miracle of
cheapness; but we consider that the age of miracles, has passed, and
especially—after the publication of “Nicholas Nickleby”—of such
miracles as this. - -
As the principal of this Gymnasium “will call upon applicants,” we
would recommend those whom he may honour with this, attention, to
interrogate him rather particularly with regard to the quality of his prº:
visions for the *:::: and mental nutrition of his juvenile charges, if
the nature of those arrangements is of any consequence to the parent
uncle, aunt, or guardian concerned. As this may, in some disgracefu
instances, not happen to be the case, we think it would be as well that
cheap Yorkshire schools should be liable to inspection, as well as nun-
neries and all other private institutions in which the well-being of any
persons—young or old, male or female—maybe under the contro of other
persons, subject to human passions and frailties, and therefore, though
perhaps highly respectable, not implicitly to be trusted.
REAL HUSTINGS ELOQUENCE.
The noblest—although somewhat of the shortest-speech made
during the elections was the speech of MR. BEREspoRD, late major of
the Lancers, late whipper-in º: Tories, and actual Secretary at War
under LoRD DERby. §:o. the silver-tongued, stood upon the
husings of North Essex; and as he was much hooted, BEREsroRD
mildly called his opponents mere rabble. Whereupon said rabble
hooted again. Whereupon BERESFORD meekly observed-
“I appeal to the freeholders, to the landowners, and to the clergy of North Essex,
who I am sure will return me in spite of your brawls. (Great confusion.) I despise
gou from my heart as the vilest rabble I ever saw.”
BEREspoRD throws himself like a Tory and a Christian upon the
Clergy, and then denounces his men and brethren as “the vilest rabble”
he ever saw. We call this large, full-mouthed eloquence. If a dust-
hole could speak, could its utterance be larger or more choice than the
utterance of that deep-chested late .*.T. large-hearted
Secretary at War of the Tory Cabinet P The rabble! Very goo
indeed, ex-major. These men are rabble, because they have no votes:

THE SUBSTITUTE FOR PROTECTION.
SONG FOR THE AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.
*TIs all up wi' Protection; so let’s be content,
It wasn't much good but to bolster up Rent;
A ton of cheap guano'd be werth more to we
Than all the Protection as ever could be.
But now for our guano we’ve got for to goo
To them Lobos Islands, out there by Peru.
For the stuff, by itself, a long price we must pay;
And then there's the carriage, besides, to defray.
So far for manoeuvre ah! why should we roam P
When we have abundance and plenty at home,
Which to waste as we do is a shame and a sin,
When we might rejoice and be thankful therein.
I went up to Lunnun, no long time ago,
And on to the Thames for a breeze and a blow;
I might ha' took a sail on the hoss-pond as well,
For the look o’ the water and likewise the smell.
Thinks I, this here river, so yoller as flows,
Is no pleasant thing to have under one's nose,
But wi' a few cartloads on't over a field,
Loramassy, to think what a crop 'a would yield !
And here you be lettun a stream like that there,
As might fatten the earth, only pizon the air,
You might turn the best part o' that flooid to bread,
And you gets nothin' out on’t but fever instead.
A brook by my farm-yard runs pleasant and clear;
I might make un exactly like this river here,
# turnin' un into a drain, to convey
All the good o' the pigsty and stable away.
The riches each poor country clodhopper saves,
You allows to be swoller'd right up by the waves,
Save a potion as don't goo so far as the sea,
Which you swollers yourselves in your beer and your tea.
Ammonia, and such like, to plants is a treat;
But for my part I must say I don't like such meat;
I’d rather, myself, from such dainties refrain,
Till in Natur's due course they be changed into grain.
But had we the stuff of the Thames at command,
What a boon it would be and relief to the land
We farmers should find it of far moor avail,
Than either fixed dooty, or up-and-down scale.
If I’d as much on it as I could employ
My buzzum 'twould filiwi peace, comfort, and joy;
And the Cockneys would also be joyful and glad,
If they was so well rid of rubbish so bad.
The best way to smooth all our diff'rences down,
Would be giving to Country the drainage of Town;
To both at the same time affording relief,
Of either 'twould banish the sorrow and grief.
Some help of this nature would be our best boon—
If you asks for Protection, you cries for the moon—
So now give Dish AELI and DERBy to know
That manoeuvre's the best thing that they can bestow.
DEATH OF “JOHN DOE AND RICHARD ROE.”
WE are told that on the 24th of October next, these great characters
—great in their fiction and falsehood—will cease, even as lies, to exist.
A statute of the last session enacts that
“Instead of the present proceeding by ejectment, a writ shall be issued, directed to
the persons in possession of the prºperty claimed, which property shall be described in
d|the writ with reasonable certainty.
Reasonable certainty! ... And is law to be made a thing of reason
Then what is called justice may take a chandler's shop, and with her
false weights, vend soap and candles."
We understand that the oldest attorneys contemplate the formation
of a committee, whose object shall be a public professional funeral of
the deceased DoE and Roe; a few enthusiasts, in anticipation of the
mournful event, have already had their coats dipped a deeper black.
The deceased will be buried, at midnight, the bells of the Inns of
Court tolling half-minute strokes. “Service” will be performed either

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
THE DAWN
OF ART IN THE CITY.
THE City of London has always
been remarkable for its taste

calipash, calipee, whitebait,
haunch of venison, and such

goo gs o Ing an
sculpture. It º that
these two arts are combined
in the statues of Gog and
MAGog; but neither the
City jº nor the image
of old MR. BECKFORD at
Guildhall, will bear a judi-
cious comparison with the
| “LAocoon,” or the “Belve-
DERE APOLLO,” or, indeed,
with any tolerable High-
lander at a tobacconist's
door. The Mansion House
is even worse off than Guild-
hall for sculptural embellish-
ments, having . absolutely
none, but lodgings to let
for, sixteen, in as many
niches, which the architect
of the building, with a view
-
the goddess of enormous i. and, at any rate,
one of the niches should be allotted to TIME, old TEMPUs,
edar rerum, the great consumer.
There is a talk, also, of decorating the interior of Saint
Paul's with appropriate paintings; and ARCHDEAcon
has proposed that these should consist of illustrations of
sacred history: so as to render the whole interior of the
cathedral a pictorial Bible. A very good idea this, par-
ticularly since, in the present state of national education,
such a Bible is the only one that a very considerable class
of persons can read.
n preference to the ARCHDEACON's F. some may be
inclined to recommend that the pictures to adorn the inside
of St. Paul's, should, like the productions of mediaeval
church-painters, illustrate the ecclesiastical tone and cha-
racter of the age. To correspond with the saints in im
sible attitudes doing impossible things, as delineated by
the veritable pre-RAPHAELITEs, it may be thought that the
pictorial decorations of our metropolitan church should
represent clerical parties and persons in the positions, and
discharging the functions, which they actually stand in
and perform. For instance—if the artist could manage
such a thing—a pluralist might be º: attending
to several livings at once. . A fresco might show a Bishop,
assisted by one or more subordinate cle en, celebrating
a “marriage in high life,” on the one hand; and on the
other, a single curate joining in holy matrimony a score
of couples of the inferior classes at a time. A second
might display a would be patron of a living buying a
next presentation: the existing incumbent in the back-
ground, an octogenarian, depicted in the ancient allego-

the Committee for General Purposes, desirous, we suppose, to vindicate the

can assure our fellow-citizens that we shall have much pleasure in suggestin

Still, on the whole, perhaps, such representations, how-
ever truthful, would be too absurd ; though less absurd
than wry-necked, bumble-footed saints doing incredible
thaumaturgy. It is therefore to be hoped, for the en-
couragement of Art, and the cultivation of public ideality
that ARCHDEAcon HALE's scheme will be carried out, and
that the DEAN and CHAPTER of St. PAUL’s will contri-
bute thereto with unwonted liberality.
MISS VIOLET AND HER “ OFFERS.”
-º-
CHAPTER XIII.
O! if I were T. a sentimental story about somebody else, what
a beautiful page I would try to compose here, showing what her feelings
ought to have been after the event described by papa in the last
chapter. Qnly, then, I am not a heroine. I am certain, for papa has
said so (and he is always right), that I must have given ALBANY cause
to think I loved him sincerely, and I felt very grieved that papa did not
see his way to giving his consent to our marriage. But if I could have
seen, at the time, the dear kind letter which made my last chapter, and
had known how papa was planning and plotting for our happiness,
I should have cried for joy ten times as much as I did for sorrow.
I felt so sure that all would come right, from the moment papa had
thought it worth his while to understand ALBANY, that I went about
the house as ...; possible, and every day put Eau de Cologne
into papa's handkerchief, picked the shells off his eggs, and dried the
Times for him, without everlooking up mournfully, and saying, “Behold
your work, my iron-hearted sire, my lip may writhe with a smile, but
my wounded heart languishes into premature interment.” Indeed, such
a speech would have been beyond my powers; but papa read it from a
}. but popular romance of domestic life, a number of which he
ound on the rug in the breakfast room at, Brighton, and politely
returned, in the tongs, to the indignant subscriber and housemaid when
she brought in the coal-scuttle. I think it right to quote it, because
doing so shows that I know what ought to have been said here,
if I were writing for º
But when I say that I soon had another offer, and received it civilly,
what ever will be thought of me? Patrons of popular literature will
turn away their faces in, contempt. . Another's vows, another spouse,
while Hope lies crushed in Gloom ' away, avaunt, I won't, I shan't,
go, harrow not the Tomb. But it is true, and what would make the fact
still more valuable to a declamatory young lady, the offer was an
aristocratic one, and therefore one which she would, of course, have
trampled upon with increased bitterness of contempt. LoRD
ANTHRAcITE proposed to me.
LoRD ANTHRACITE is a middle-aged, man, by no means, rich, or
influential, or notorious. He is an excellent, easy-going, kind-hearted
person, whose father mortgaged, to buy horses, nearly all the property
his grandfather had not mortgaged to buy voters. Consequently the
present peer's establishment is a simple one, with, which he is simple
enough to be content, and has neither sold himself for a rich
wife, nor his proxy for “something from those fellows”—I hope I am
not unlady-like in using words I hear, sometimes, from gentlemen who
ought to know how Governments should be spoken of. His Lordship
has very few relations, and I think the only one he much cares about,
is a widow cousin, who was once, a beauty, and, on the credit of past
glories, gives herself many airs. She has managed to obtain apartments
at one of the country Palaces, and may be seen at a, window on
the days the common people are let into the gardens. She evidently
regards them as trespassers, and almost makes faces at them if, they
venture to look up at the little forests of hydrangias and calceolarias
which cover her window-sills. LoRD ANTHRACITE was once her
suitor, but was rejected for a half-caste Croesus, who died ſrom a deter:
mination of brandy to the head, leaving all his money to the Jesuit
riest who had converted him. The widow returned from India, and
ound it difficult to get another husband, so she forgave LoRD ANTHRA-
cite, but he would never renew his offer, and contented himself with
paying her for years twice the attention of any fiancé. He was and is,
for I have not interfered—perpetually driving down to the Palace with
.. strawberries, and peaches, at seasons when the price of one of the
askets he buys would keep a quiet family for a ſortnight. This is his
only extravagance, I believe, and he is punished for it by her capricious-
ness, for, in his presence, she will often give his beautiful fruit to her
monkey or her page. But he never seems vexed with her, and if, on
arriving at the country Palace with a pine-apple, she should send him
back to Covent Garden to change it for sixpennyworth of oranges, he
would be rather pleased—not that he is in the least degree a silly
person.
When HER MAJESTY was about to open Parliament, LoBD ANTHRA-
cite (whose quiet, old world stories papa likes very much-they seem
to have more reality than the smart anecdotes, with bits of French in
them, with which dining-out gentlemen pay for their dinners in these
days), knowing I had never seen the ceremony, obtained tickets for his
cousin and me. I was delighted, and papa declares that I actually
“fidgetted” to get him to the House of Lords {{ twelve o'clock.
There we were to meet LoRD ANTHRACITE and MRs, LALL GONG
BANGLE. He was punctual enough, but she was not, and after waiting

for sights, and she hoped he would get tickets, for the prorogation
j He looked more angry than I ever saw him before, but there
was no time to waste, and nobody to take care of me.
“I could put you into your place,” he said, “but it is a bore not to
have somebody to tell you who people are—it is too bad of JULIA,
almost, but she is very delicate—ah! there is the DUCHESS OF
LLANGolleN, I will speak to her.”
“Certainly, with the greatest pleasure,” said, a minute afterwards,
one of the kindest and most cheerful voices I ever heard (to be sure,
one would have been actually disappointed if any other kind of voice
had belonged to that sunshiny face), “and I am only sorry she cannot
sit with me. But I will take care of her, and I am glad to see,” she
added laughing, “that you have condescended to find out at last that
there is somebody else in the world besides people who live in Palaces.
My dear,” she continued, taking my hand as I was presented, “we are
late, I mean you are, so we will go in at once; and youf and robe,”
she said to Lord ANTHRACITE., Papa nodded to me, and the Duchess
took me through halls and corridors, until we reached a splendid room,
full of colour and carving, and a perfect, crowd of officers in uniform,
glittering cuirasses and waving feathers; beef-eaters, with their
wonderful ruffs; theatrical-looking pages; noblemen in scarlet robes,
barred according to rank; two or three judges (who laughed more than
anybody), and a few ladies splendidly dressed, but nobody had such
diamonds as my conductress. The throng made way for her instantly;
she had a look and a smile for everybody—and we passed through a
beautifully carved doorway, and were in the House of Lords.
Of course I had seen the chamber, but the seeing it empty or with a
dozen carelessly dressed gentlemen scattered about it, is quite another
thing from seeing it applied to the º: for which I am certain it
was built. MR. BARRY meant, (and, I wonder he has never had the
courage to say so) that the Lords should meet in one of their com-
fortable libraries or refreshment rooms, and that the “House" should be
kept for the QUEEN and the ladies. The fif the coloured glass,
the frescoes, the statues, the heraldry, and all the rich and glittering
ornament at once fall into their place in the picture, when the body of
the chamber is filled with ladies, and the gorgeous throne-work becomes
a mere background to the figure of the Lady of England. However,
these were after thoughts, for, at the moment, I could, only think of
what was going to be done with me. Such a polite gentleman (and yet
his tone was a little peremptory, as if he were accustomed to deal with
unreasonable requests) came up, and showing the Duchess a seat on
the benches to the left, looked at me doubtfully, as much as to say,
“Surely LADY BERTHA's hair is lighter than that.”
“I want you, SIRTIBERIUs,” said the Duchess, “to
º into the very best place in the whole House, and
Will.”
“Not a Peeress, I think?” said the fºllº", bowing.
“Not at present,” said the Duchess, demurely.
“In that case, this way,” said the gentleman; and he conducted me
to the right of the Throne, and below a compartment, in front of which
were some bishops, and behind them glittering attachés, in all the uni-
forms of the civilised and uncivilised world. There were several rows
of benches, full of untitled ladies, and they looked at me as we ladies
always look at a stranger, with the expression which says, “There is no
room, or if there is, I am not going to make it for you.” But SIR
TIBERIUs was peremptory, and a most vinegar-faced dowager was
obliged to put up with only about as much room as was necessary, instead
of expanding over three times her rightful seat. The Duchess came
over, saw me comfortably placed, and said that we should meet after
the ceremony.
The vinegar-faced dowager examined me haughtily for some time,
and then said in a grim voice—
“Who was ºff. ?”
“The Duchess of LLANGolleN,” I replied.
.O dear, how she softened Had I never been there before? Q, how
nice, as she could tell me everything. Those seats opposite were for the
Peeresses and their families; these, for untitled people. The judges
were clustering, I could see, in the middle—their wigs like a bunch of
mushrooms. A row of noblemen had the front places all round.
That was the Duke; how well he looked. Those dukes up there? No,
my dear, those are the newspapers—I mean the writers. That is LoRD
Jones, whose wife ran away from him, and there is Lord SMITH, who
ran away from his wife. That is the Duke of HECLA, celebrated for
logical powers and red hair. There is the PREMIER—no, there, with
his glass to his eye, meditating a joke, I dare say, on somebody. The
nobleman with the curl is Lord MALMesbury; he is bending to the
Austrian Official in blue. . That is an Oriental prince; he murdered
with his own hand sixty of his uncles and aunts—I am in great hopes
to meet him at a party next week—look at his emeralds ! Ah! the
guns—how punctual the QUEEN always is
And then came the procession, and the imposing group into which it
formed itself around the Sovereign, making with its accessories a whole
constitutional history of England, told to the eye and illuminated.
And then the formalities, the stately Speaker of the Commons
with his black-coated constituents swarming behind him, and his proud
*: this young
am sure you
but courtly address on their behalf. And then a kneeling Chancellor,
presenting the speech to HER MAJESTY-how much better ALBANY
will look when he does it—and then a clear and silvery delivery by the
QUEEN, who leaves you the impression that, though She is reading the
speech, you have got it by heart. And then the farewell by HER
MAJESTY, and the closing and intermingling of the most variegated
crowd that ever assembles.
LoRD ANTHRACITE, in his robes, soon brought me to the Duchess,
and she was kind enough to ask me to come to see her beautiful and
celebrated house. This I was much pleased at. I was less pleased
that some days afterwards his Lordship intimated that it rested with
myself to sit on the left hand of the Queen, at the jº How
ever, he received my answer very good-humouredly; and the other
day sent me some extraordinary nectarines, of which I believe he
defrauded MRs. LALL Gong BANGLE.

SIR FITZROY WEASEL KELLY.
FITzRoy, KELLY—the brass-plate to the door of Downing Street—
has again shone upon the hustings. He voted for PEEL's measure of
Free Trade, and now denounces it. Of course: our Solicitor-General
holds a brief for the Cabinet. If, however, Lord DERby should
denounce Protection, will SIR FITzRoy, asks the Chronicle—
“As on a former occasion, continue to enjoy his office, and wait for some judicial
dignity to drop. Five or six years hence, it will be time enough to proclaim his ab-
horrence of measures which he could not denounce at the moment without incurring
some personal inconvenience.”
Will SIR FITzRoy, continue to enjoy his office? Of course he will.
Catch a weasel asleep. And SIR FitzRoy is precisely the weasel that

A DOUBTFUL POINT.
LookING over a file of the Times newspaper the other day, our eye
was caught by the following passage:–
“I consider as great Criminals those who, by personal ambition, would compromise
the small amount of stability guaranteed us by the Constitution.”
These, gentle reader, are the words of PRESIDENT Louis NAPOLEoN,
delivered in his Message to the French Assembly upon its opening in
November, 1850. Their quotation, we think, is rather opportune just
now ; for if LoRD MALMESBURY’s “Extradition of Foreign Criminals
Bill” had passed into law, it clearly might have been questioned
whether, in the event of the above speaker seeking refuge on our
shores, we should not have been bound, upon his own “considering,”
to send him back again.

WE had some º in consequence of the heat, of presenting our

press rather before publication, it occurred to us that the weather
might change in the meanwhile; and besides, the refrigerative process
would have been attended with some difficulty, which could only have
been surmounted by the coolest impudence.

- THE last strain broke the camel's back, the last mouthful
º of turtle suffocated the alderman, and the last “twopenn'orth
of blue-jack”—a noxious congregation of vapours from certain
- gas-works—seems likely to prove fatal to that foul-mouthed
º old nuisance, Father Thames. Some zealous individual, with
a nose hardened against all other river-odours or fluvial effluvia,
has become painfully susceptible of “blue-jack,” and a tinc-
ture of that redolent mixture having been perceived, pro-
ceedings have been taken which threaten to have a remote, if
not an immediate effect on the degraded old river. If “blue-
jack” may be interdicted, why may not canine remains be
also excluded, and why should the population be compelled to
regard as “a harmless necessary cat,” the feline corpse that is
thrown in from time to time, to give what may be termed
“body” to the liquid which supplies so many of our tea-
tables? -
We have aldermen undertaking occasionally to put down all
sorts of improprieties-suicide among the number; but where
can there be a finer field for the exercise of those levelling
| Wº..." than in attempting to put down the Thames?

| it were to take the bold direction of an effort to set the Thames
on fire, and thus rid the metropolis of a pest that has always
been in the worst possible odour with the public at large,
A LONG PULL AND A STRONG PULL.
It is said that a German is contemplating a swim across the
channel from Calais to Dover. We recommend him to turn his
thoughts, before it is too late, into some other channel, ſo:
we suspect the British Channel will not supply to him
the tide that leads on to fortune. Perhaps the German has
heard the old song of
“The ducks and the geese they all swim over,”
and he may be of opinion that, as a goose, he is likely to accom-
plish the passage he contemplates. It would be very awkward
if the sea were to turn rough when he had proceeded a few
miles on his way, and it must be remembered that Neptune
is a smooth-faced hypocrite, whose placidity is not to be relied
on for a single hour.
FREEMAson Ry of THE WoRLD.—Sympathy.
CHARGE, LANDLORDS, CHARGE.
As the cry of “protection” is always being addressed to us by the
landlords in general, we think we are justified in calling on the
landlords of hotels, in these days of locomotion, to favour us with
“protection” against that disagreeable species of taxation to which we
are exposed, in the shape of fees to the waiters and servants of their
establishments. We intend to agitate for a reform, of this abuse by
insisting on the including of these charges in the bill, and we have
resolved that “the bill, the whole bill, and nothing but the bill” is the
watchword we will ring, as if all his bells were going at once to the
same tune, in the ears of every hotel-keeper.
In many instances the reform has been already carried out; but we
are determined that it shall be general, and that the anomaly shall
cease of an addition of twenty-five per cent. to the price of a mutton-
chop, for the waiter who hands it to us, or the addition of an equal
per centage to the cost of a bed for a night, for the benefit of the
chambermaid who has had the making of it. The purchaser of a pair
of gloves for three-and-sixpence might just as well be expected to
hand over an additional sixpence to the shopman who folds them in
paper, or the passenger in a threepenny omnibus might with equal
reason add a penny to the fare, for the conductor who opens the door
to let him in and let him out again.
We have some idea of appointing a commission to inquire into hotel
abuses, and we know of none so objectionable as the abuse a traveller
receives either openly or covertly from dissatisfied waiters, who have
been dependent for their remuneration on “what the visitor pleases,”
and whose pleasure has been shown in the practice of a rigid economy.

AN ALARMING SACRIFICE |
MATRIMONIAL “sacrifices” are by no means new to us. Almost daily
are we hearing of somebody or other of our acquaintance having
“thrown himself away,” as our informants phrase it, on the Hymeneal
Altar; and with the feminine converse to this our ears are scarcely
less familiar. But the following instance we certainly were unprepared
for, and, with all our experience, it has quite unnerved us. We stumbled
on it lately in one of those interesting sheets, the Times' Supplements
º with an address as voucher, it stands authentically recorde
thus : —
SACRIFº SALE, in consequence of a slight domestic difference,
** a very superior and well bred gelding, new Newport Pagnel cart, and plated harness:
also a thorough bred hack, with bridle, saddle, and clothing. The above cost a gen-
tleman a hundred guineas within the last two months, and no reasonable offer will
now be refused.
Of “domestic differences,” we are, perhaps, not utterly unqualified
to speak, but we must confess that the above quite passes our
experience. We are morally convinced, indeed, that our darling Judy
could never so inordinately “differ" win us, as to occasion the
necessity for our clearing out our stables in such a horribly wholesale
way as this. It really reminds us of HERCULEs and the Augean Stud.
And to think that with these tremendous consequences, the “differ-
ence” in question is absolutely reckoned “slight !” Sincerely do we
pity the unfortunate “gentleman” who, by painful comparison, is forced
to say so. If this be a specimen of his “slight domestic differences”—
a terrible problem at once suggests itself, which the marital mind
instinctively shudders to solve
Pity for Protectionists.

A PLEA FOR HERNE BAY.
E used to hear a great deal
about the “Annexation” of
Texas; and the “Union”
with Ireland once was the
subject of vast excitement,
but though these are passed,
we see, “looming, in the
future,” the probability that
we shall some day hear of
the proposed “Annexation”
of Herne Bay, and the Union
of that watering-place with
the remainder of England.
At present, the Bay and its
inhabitants remain segre-
ated from the rest of their
#. subjects, and unless
there is a “solidarity of the
oples” of . Whitstable,
§º, and Herne, the
population of the latter will
die out altogether. The
worst of it is, that the soli-
tude which was originally
forced upon the settlers at
the Bay by the apathy of
their fellow countrymen, is
becoming every day more tolerable to the former, and they are beginning
to delight in a wild exclusiveness, which causes them to discourage all
wº to their shingly and jelly-fishy shore. -
f a steam-boat does accidentally “put in” with a few voyagers,
it is met, in the first place, by a spirit of Protectionism and high prices
in the shape of pier dues, which almost amount to prohibition against
the landing of passengers. ...We regret to perceive that this state of
isolation is “telling” frightfully upon the inhabitants of Herne Bay,
and giving a sort of Yahoo-like wildness to a race once remarkable for
gentleness.
Nature is still beautiful; but Art is falling under the hands of
barbarism, and the handsome buildings that have been extravagantly §
º are being knocked barbarously down again. The Kent Hotel has had
its rooms and raſters taken out, its entrance-steps, carried, away,
its back demolished, and three of its external walls are still standing as
a shelter to a stud of goats, which, in dragging chaises, seem to form
the chief wealth of the place, -
The one policeman, however, has gone most rapidly forward; for,
though last year only an ordinary constable, we found him this year in
full superintendent's uniform, having we suppose promoted himself to
his present elevated rank, for his own—no doubt—meritorious services.
The only Government officer is the postman, who has added to the
F. of “letters” the dealing in fish and fruit, when there happens
to be any.

THE ECCLESIASTICAL EXTINGUISHER.
AMONG the yarious uses to which a mitre may be applied, one is that
of an extinguisher. It is supposed to have been invented and made
partly for the purpose of putting out New Lights of a delusive nature:
ecclesiastical Will-o'-the-Wisps. People, therefore, naturally wonder
that it has not been promptly clapped down upon the candles which
the Puseyan Methodists are in the habit of burning in broad day: and
#. imagine that it is an instrument unmanageable, without much
trouble, for that sort of operation, The fault, however, is not in the
mitre itself. How readily it can be popped over a burning and shining
light, at its proprietor's pleasure, may appear from the subjoined
paragraph from the Globe:–
“Furthen Monition or MR. GLApstone.—Mr. GLADstone, who has accepted the
Pastorate of a Free Episcopal Church at St. Mary's, Torquay, was to have preached
there on Sunday last. This, however, was prevented by a further ecclesiastical docu-
ºnent from the DRAN of ABches, arising out of, and admonishing him to obey, the
decision of that Court.”
But the GLADSTONE candle here in question is the Low Dip, and not,
as its name would imply, the High Oxford Mould. A vulgar glim like
this can be unceremoniously doused; but the other can only be
reverently besought not, to shine—or begged to remove itself and
Rhine at Frome, or elsewhere. It is a genteel composite, patronised
largely by the nobility and gentry: a superior article—many degrees
above the Thirty-Nine—in vogue with the superior classes. It is also
a candle that throws a fine lustre upon prelacy: and is to be gingerly
snuffed by Bishops, and not put out.
There is one sort of candle, probably, that Mr. GLADstone's
Bishop—for the Bishop won't let Mr. GAdstone shake him off–
would be disposed to suffer him to burn just now; a small taper, to be
borne by the reverend gentleman about the town in a white sheet and
without his boots. And till he shall have submitted to this or an
equivalent humiliation, his mouth is to be stopped—no matter if its
closure shall involve starvation. For MR. GLADSTONE, having resigned
established loaves and fishes, is fain to support himself on the more
humble food which Dissenting ministers do eat—but he may not.

right of every Englishman, and which is said to be so grievously

IAMENT ON THE DEATHS OF JOHN DOE AND
RICHARD ROE.
By a Junior of Forty Years' Sitting.
So they have kill'd my pretty ones, my friends through weal and woe,
No more shall they “run # and down,” John DoE and Richard Roe :
The strong of arm and swift of foot—so clever at a flaw,
So quick at all the ups and downs, the ins and outs of law;
My stalwart DoE, light-footed Roe, your nimbleness and skill
Can never now be shown again in running up a bill.
Adieu to yel fictitious chiefs, defending phantom posts;
Fighting imaginary fights, leading to real costs.
As casual ejector, no more shall Richand Roe
Grind suitors’ bones for lawyers’ bread—aided by pliant DoE.
No more shall RICHARD hold the ground which John seeks to obtain,
While those who have a right to it are asking it in vain.
No more shall DOE by force of arms—anglice costs—oppose
The lawful owner of a field from entering his close :
Continuing hostility for costs’ unholy sake,
Until for him who “takes,” at last, there's nothing left to take.
But though I mourn thee, DoE and Roe, in conscience I confess,
#º. few have had | pity more, none have deserv'd it less :
Let those who on your final fate would throw away regret,
Seek for your ruined victims in every year's Gazette;
The list of bankrupts let them read, and teach them then to know
How .# have been brought to it by either DoE or Roe;
By shameful legal fictions, by shams and humbugs vast,
Of which you have been long the types—not least, nor quite the last,
Sham pleas, sham issues are defunct, but there are real ills,
Still left us in the frightful shape of real lawyers' bills:
“Instructions” and “attendances” our senses still amaze,
º: all but the sum total into a º haze.
But all these old monstrosities are surely doom'd to go,
For what imposture can survive John DoE and RICHARD Roe
A GREAT MISTAKE IN THE TIMES.
IT is not often that we find ourselves at serious issue with the Times.
But a remark appeared the other day in that journal, so entirely con-
trary to fact, nay, so inconsistent with our contemporary's own previous
assertions and arguments, that we are compelled to point out its great
inaccuracy. In a notice of the annual agricultural gathering at MR.
MECHI’s farm, our contemporary said:–
“MR. Mr.chi does for his crops what the Water Companies of London attempt, but
do not succeed in effecting for its inhabitants.”
What MR. MECHI does for his crops is anteriorly explained by the
Times to be the distribution of liquid manure over his land. Now,
that is precisely what, in supplying the metropolis with Thames water,
the Water Companies do—though not quite so cleverly, perhaps, as
MR. MECHI manages it—for the Londoners.

:
THE KOH-I-NOOR OUT AND COME AGAIN.
EveRYBody knows that “All that Glitters is not Gold,” and it had
been suspected by some that the reverse of the proverb may be true,
and that a diamond which will not sparkle may, after all, be no diamond.
The Mountain of Light behaved so obstinately during the Great
Exhibition as to have worn a gloom which nothing could dispel;
and it seems since to have struck the parties interested, that a precious
stone which can shine and won’t shine, ought to be made to shine, even
though a painful operation should be requisite.
e hardly know how to describe the nature of the operation, unless
we compare it to the removal of cataract from the Mountain, so as to
bring out the eye of the Koh-i-Noor into a state of brilliancy. Numerous
consultations were held over the case of this illustrious patient, and it
was at length resolved that the Mountain should be taken to the
operator—because, we presume, it was not convenient for the operator
to go to the Mountain. Previous to the removal of the patient several
opinions were taken as to the possibility of performing the operation
without a fatal result, and Professor TENNANT was called in, who
consulted with MR. Mitch ELL; when, after considering the conse-
quences involved in the principle of Diamond cut Diamond, these savants
ultimately reported on the experiment. They thought the operation
would be attended with serious danger to the patient's side, and they
refused to answer for the consequences of any lateral cutting; but,
after looking at the gem on the right and left, they admitted there was
something to be said on both sides. This was so unsatisfactory that
the friends of the Koh-i-Noor determined on getting “other advice,”
and MEssks. GARRARD, the silversmiths of Panton Street, were
instructed to “call in ’’ anybody they thought proper. They imme-
diately sent to Amsterdam for two Dutchmen, on the principle,
perhaps, that, when a difficult process has, to be performed, the
exclamation, “If I do it, l’m a Dutchman,” is a common form of
declining the responsibility of undertaking it.
The Dutchmen, with the characteristic audacity of their race, pro-
nounced the operation possible; and, fortified by this opinion, the
parties had, for the first time, the spirit and liberality to order the
‘requisite machinery,” consisting of “a small steam-engine,” of from
two to four-horse power—a force something between that of a
Blackwall 'bus and an ordinary coal-waggon. The putting up of this
trumpery little machine on the premises “under the direction of
MR. Joshua FIELD, of the firm of MAUDslay, FIELD, AND Son,” was,
it seems, a most elaborate business, and excited the interest of no less
a personage than F. M. the Duke of WELLINGton, who went back-
wards and forwards several times to see how it got on, just as we
ourselves, in our very young days, would go to and fro several times to a
neighbouring court to witness the progress made in the construction of
a grotto on oyster day. As the culminating point of interest would
of course be the introduction of the light in the latter case, so, in the
former, the placing of the Mountain in the machinery was the ceremony
that chiefly attracted the Duke, who was “received ” on the occasion
—and on the mat—by the MEssRs. GARRARd.
The important operation was then commenced by placing the illus-
trious patient on a bed of lead, to which it was carefully confined—lest
it should wince, we suppose-and the Duke with his own hand placed
the gem in the position necessary for cutting. A small portion of the
. was removed, but this was thought to be as much as the gem
could safely bear on one day, and the operation was discontinued, to
be resumed at intervals for some months to come—the Dutch operators
remaining in attendance on the patient during the whole period. We
suppose it is absolutely necessary to make such a very long job of it,
though it might occur to the economist to ask the question whether
the Dutchmen might not just as well “cut, and come again” should
they be wanted P
After all this ſuss had been made, and expense gone to, a discussion
arose as to whether the patient really is itself after all—whether the
Koh-i-Noor is the Koh-i-Noor?—a query that seems to us a little like
taking off a man's leg, and then proceeding to ask whether he is
the individual in whose case amputation is required. It is bad enough
when a beadle thrashes the wrong boy, but it will be too bad if ;
savants, and the Dutchmen, and the Duke, have after all, got hold
of the wrong diamond.
The account of the operation on the Koh-i-Noor is varied by a short
off-hand allusion to a misfortune to MR. GARRARD, who “fell through
an aperture,” poor man, and broke his leg; but we hear nothing more
of this, and the account of the operation on the Koh-i-Noor is pro-
ceeded with. MR. GARRARD might, it seeins, have been broken to
pieces, and left to collect himself as he best could, without exciting
one-hundredth part of the sympathy that would have been claimed
by the reporter for the Koh-i-Noor if it had sustained the smallest
possible damage.
As the operation on the Mountain of Light is to be a work of several

months, we shall of course be favoured with a regular series of
bulletins, but we hope we shall not be stigmatised as brutes wholly
insensible to the beauties of the Koh-i-Noor, if we admit that we shall
hear with more pleasure of the restoration of MR. GARRARD's leg, than
of the favourable progress of the diamond.

A. Rabble is a ºftion of creatures that hiss and hook.
Q. Biped or quadruped P
A. I believe, biped.
Q. Of what are they ordinarily composed? ..
A. Mud, tempered with ditch-water. Sometimes, they are made of
road-scrapings; they are sometimes found of pure clay.
Are you aware that all men are said to be made of dust?
A. There is, I believe, a popular error to that effect; but the fallacy
does not obtain in good society.
% Are you aware that ADAM signifies, in the original tongue, red
earth
A. Possibly. It may, and it mayn't. . Don't know.
Q. What is your duty towards the rabble?
A. My duty towards the rabble is, from the ver
heart (wherever that may be) to loathe, detest,

in your opinion-in the scale of creation, is, the proper place of the
rabble? Take, for instance, an individual. One of the rabble P
A. I think it holds–
Q. It £ You will be pleased—though with some violence to the
prejudices of your birth and education—to speak of the rabble as
persons, not as things. -
A. Very well; from the bottom of my heart. Well, then, 1 believe
that one of the rabble is ...T. sort of link between an ape and a
contented labourer. I have, I think, read of apes that chop sticks and
draw water, and walk upright on two legs; I have no doubt that moral
anatomy would establish the analogy. No doubt of it. Yes; one of
the rabble is a link between an ape and a labourer—a contented
labourer.
Q. Has the rabble any voice? -
A. Certainly not: it is the want of voice that is the rabble's
diº. want.
Q. No voice whatever? ..
A. None: that is—no articulate voice. The rabble can hoot, and
hiss, and groan, and gabble; and that is the reason why every gentle-
man, from the very bottom of his heart, is bound to despise it.
Q. But supposing that the rabble could, by Act of Parliament, for
instance, obtain voices—they would then be rabble no longer ?
A. Certainly not. Just as a porwigle when it grows to a frog, and
comes to its croak, is a frog, and no longer a porwigle.
Q. The rabble, having no articulate voices, you conceive it to be your
bounden duty to hate, and, from the bottom of your heart, despise

CHAPTER XIV.
I HAVE been heartily vexed, and there is not a soul upon whom I
can throw the blame, .# one dear old soul, upon whom I would
not throw any for the world—AUNTy RATCHET, who came to stay with
me during papa's absence at an election. I wanted papa to “pair off”
with MR. PLUMPERTON, a particular friend of his, who was going to
support the opposite candidate; but MR. PLUMPERton said, laughing
that he could not agree, to this, as his candidate's, committee had
written to beg that no voter would pair, unless, he had broken his leg,
or was too ill to go down, in which cases he might, as he would then
clearly rob the other side of a good vote, giving nothing in return.
Papa said that the committee's suggestion was as sharp a piece
of Old Bailey attorneyism as he had ever seen; and he was quite
glad it had proceeded from the Exeter Hall party, as otherwise mere
worldly º: might have thought it scarcely hones".
While papa was gone, an opera-box was sent, him, which I gave to
Aunty. She, in her good nature, immediately thought of some people
who had never been to the Opera, and upon whom she thought to
confer a marvellous treat. The GITTINGSEs live at Rotherhithe, and I
believe they are very well off, and, tºº." AUNTY RATCHEt, very
comfortable, as indeed she said-after the box had been sent away-
anybody might see, who would go to Rotherhithe on a Sunday after-
moon, and observe GITTINGs, with his coat off, smoking a pipe at
the parlour window. - - -
“I suppose, Aunt, dear,” I said in some perturbation, “he knows
he must go to Covent Garden with his coat and without his pipe?”
“He WILY, darling! Catch him out of bed after ten o’clock'
But he will send his wife and daughter, and I suppose MARGARET's
intended will escort them—a very genteel young man, something in a
lace house, I fancy.”
So I thought no more about the matter, and on the Saturday evening
for which the box had been sent us, AUNTRATCHET and I had quietly
sat down, I to read and she to listen to a new novel—the greatest
pleasure the dear old thing can experience, provided the book is one she
can cry over a good deal. And as º who can write at all can write
afflicting scenes, there is no difficulty in selecting a book to Aunty's taste.
We had fairly begun, and a shocking scene—a wife's death by consump-
tion, with savage bailiffs in the house, and poor little children crying for
food in the nursery—had just started our first flood of tears, and we were
coming to the father's destroying himself, when a carriage stopped at
the door. I thought it was papa, and darted out to receive him on the
stairs, just in time to make it impossible for the servant to say we were
not at home to the GITTINGSEs. Up they came, MRs. GITTINGs, and
No. 577.*

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Miss MARGARET GITTINGs, and the young gentleman from the lace
house, whose light hair, stiff from the curling irons, white face, and deep
voice, struck meless than a most magnificent blue satin crayat, with lace
ends and crimson spots, which perfectly arrested the eye. I am certain I
gazed at it with the stare papa is so rude about. But Istared more when
MRs. GITTI Gs developed her purpose. She stated, fairly enough,that the
present of the box had been one of bewildering magnificence, that
neither she, nor MEG, nor MR. SAM Point (who was here introduced),
had ever been to the Opera, and that they had come round in the ho
of finding us at home, to beg that MIss WIoLET (it was of no use, she
knew, asking Aunty) would go with them, and put them—as she worded
tº: the right way. They had found us, and now would I be so very
In
And then AUNT RATCHET, instead of instantly and º
declaring, as became her, that such a thing was impossible—that I was
too ill to leave the house—that in a quarter of an hour I was going to
be fetched to a party at the ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY's—or that
my father had written to me, commanding me, under pain of his per-
petual anger, to wait his arrival, as he had some painful news for me-
or all three excuses together—must look first at me, and then at
MRs. GITTINGs, and then smile, and then look at all of us, and finally
say that she knew I was very fond of music, and there was nothing to
keep me at home, and that she was always glad to see young people
enjoying themselves—O, I could have pulled the needles out of her
knitting for her, I was in such a *. But what was I to do?—the
r Mrs. GITTINGs had pleaded her case so truthfully, and, though
had never seen her before, she was an old friend of Aunty's, and
I could not tell her I did not want to make acquaintance with the
future MRs. SAM Pont, or her fiancé, and there was nobody to help
me—and, in short, I thought, as Aunt gave up her dear novel without
a murmur, I ought not to be ill-natured—and I assented. If they had
been going to be cast into a den of lions, and I had been a Miss Van
Amburgh, the cry of joy they all set up at finding a protectress could
hardly have been heartier.
“I must dress, Aunt,” I said, “but I shall not be long.”
“O, I’m sure, Miss, you’ll do quite well as you are,” said MR.
SAM Point politely. “Any change would be a change for the wus,
I should say.”
However, I º and sent for Aunty, and instead of ecolding
her the least little bit in the world, or letting her see my vexation
I only made her apprise MR. Point that his splendid blue stock, an
all its spots, must be a sacrifice to operatic despotism. He fought
hard for his finery, it seems, and I was ready by the time Aunt had
persuaded him into a white cravat of papa's, and even that foolish, red-
cheeked, petulant. MARGARET supported him in his obstinacy, and
“thought it a great .# on the #. of the keeper of a theatre to
dictate what people should wear.” However, he put his glories care-
fully into his pocket, and we went. I piloted the º very quietly,
and was very firm about sitting in the back of the box all the evening,
alleging as a reason—and it was a very good one—that the scene was
new to the others.
The Prophète was performed, but after the first ten minutes I saw
they took little interest in it, and MR. PoſNT frankly said, later, that it
was all very fine, but nothing to remember, and give him something he
could understand, with tunes that he could whistle next day. Did
MARGARET remember how the Snambla had been done at the Wells P
That was music, if you liked, and when the Snambla dropped her candle-
stick into the water, and the bridge broke, it was so natural-like.
MARGARET, the red-cheeked, assented with almost a spiteful
readiness. She seemed anxious to depreciate everything, and was
clearly out of humour, and I was the cause, and it would be affectation
to pretend I did not know why. She was very smart, and her cris
hair, though not very fine, was elaborately frizzled out, and her ij.
was immense, as were her bracelets; she had a fº. many ribbons of
bright colours, and she was altogether showy. I was quietly dressed
in white, with my hair plain, and with scarcely an ornament. And yet
she managed, though anything but clever, to find out that I looked
better than she did, and that Mr. Sam Point was also finding out the
fact. She perfectly snubbed me, and was downright rude when
I ventured to tell her what parts of the Opera were considered
finest; but when I looked away, she was constantly º; my dress,
and I was certain that she was making mental memoranda of it.
But this was nothing. An ill-bred girl from Rotherhithe was not likely
to put me out of humour. But MR. SAM Point became actively disagree-
able. . After the first act, he found out the refreshment-room, and con-
ceived it his duty, between every act thenceforth, to send in masses of
confectionary, with ices, jellies, wafers, and cherry-brandy, and to press
them upon us with the air of an old-fashioned host doing the honours
at dinner. To all my refusals he was quite deaf, and almost forced the
glasses of ice into my hand; and then a new idea suddenly striking
him in regard to my objections, he urged that, as the box had cost
them nothing, it was but fair play that they should “stand treat.”
MARGARET was sulky, and would at first take nothing; but afterwards
demanded ºverything that was not there, sending her lover back-
wards and forwards incessantly. But MR. SAM Point did not omit to
take care of himself when away, and returned each time with a steadier
eye and an unsteadier step, and with his deep voice thickening. At
last his evident admiration for me became perfectly absurd. He took
the most elaborated means of assuring me of his respectability; men:
tioned the sums which passed through his hands weekly, and explained
that the house relied solely on his opinion, and that if he said, “Gents,
that’s the thing to do,” the thing was done, and no bones about it.
Meantime, poor MARGARET, on whom he literally turned his back, was
actually ghºstly with wrath; and though, if she had had any sense
she would have seen that I was much more annoyed than she could
be, she only looked at the matter as an attempt of mine to take her
“beau” from her. Finally, when in a moment of playfulness MR.
Point tossed a ratafia cake into her lap, she shook it down with fright-
ful asperity, observing with a vicious snap, that he had “better throw
his rubbish where he threw his love.” O ! how glad I was, when
MARIO finished that glorious song of mingled triumph and despair, and
blew up his palace.
In the carriage MR. PoſNT was more demonstrative than ever, and
hoped he might be allowed to improve my acquaintance. I said that
we were going out of town, and he then begged my address. I gravely
referred him to the Court Guide, which he said he should consult next
day, as it was bound up in the Directory. And on arriving at home he
insisted on shaking hands most cordially, and actually tried to detain
me in conversation at the door. AUNTY. RATCHET's coming down
saved this chapter from containing another “Offer.”
He stumbled back to the carriage. MRs. GITTINGs was asleep.
But MARGARET GITTINGs was not—decidedly not. Poor Mr. Point.
But he deservee, all he may have received, for helping to make my
evening unnecessarily disagreeable.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI. 61
A WAG OF THE COUNTRY PARTY.
WER anxious for the
encouragement of native
talent, we have much
pleasure in commending
a case of great ability—
in a peculiar line—to
the attention of our
readers. The papers
have chronicled a riot
which occurred the other
day at Wellingborough,
on the occasion of the
North, Northampton-
shire election. That this
disturbance should have
taken place is not re-
markable, as the Pro-
tectionists, who formed
the electoral majority,
thought proper to amuse
themselves by taunting
and jeering the multi-
tude of non-electors-
otherwise, till suffrage-extension shall have rendered them respectable voters, “the
rabble.” As Protectionist jokes, if they could be carried out, would be jokes very
much at the said rabble's expense, the subjects of these pleasantries were, as may
be supposed, considerably irritated thereby: when, says a morning contemporary,
"At length, one of the voters, a young farmer from Finedon, came up, and professed to fraternise
with the crowd, praised the “big loaf system,” and said he was going to plump for Fitzwilliamſ:
Arrived at the polling booth, he bawled out with needless ostentation ‘Stafford (Derbyite) only,"
and then, turning round to the crowd, he greeted them with a horse-laugh. The patience of the
bystanders was now fairly gone, and a pebble struck the farmer's head"—
But, we are happy to say, did not break it. The casket ºf such peculiarly
valuable treasures as those enclosed in the cranium of this youthful agriculturist,
is doubtless of a strength sufficient to resist considerable violence. But the gift, or
specialty, of this rural genius should be turned to account; and, therefore, we
propose that a subscription should be raised for the purpose of providing him with
a handsomely decorated horse-collar. By grinning through this at fairs and wakes,
he may afford innocent amusement to his fellow swains, and be rewarded, perhaps,
with something better than pebbles. That will be preferable to showing his teeth
ºn the hustings; for, as perhaps he has found, grinning on the wrong side of politics
is apt to be followed by grinning on the wrong side of the mouth. This youth is
as yet unknown to fame; but we will furnish him with an introduction, if he wishes
it, and will send us his name, that we may publish it together with a proposal for
subscriptions to get him a horse-collar.
THE BETTING.OFFICE FREQUENTER'S
PROGRESS.
AIR.—"She wore a Wreath of Roses.”
He wore a suit of Moses,
The night when first we met,
And knowingly his hat was cocked
º his curls of jet;
Flash “Publics” he frequented,
Where “Sporting cards” were seen;
And many a Derb Sweep got up
To ease them of their “tin.”
I saw him in his glory—
(The word seems doubtful now),
When to his stable wisdom
His admiring chums would bow.
A betting-book he'd started,
When next this youth I saw;
And hourly he was lounging at
Some Betting-Office door;
Or §ºnding treat, to stable-boys
With a “weed” between his lips,
And listening to their sage discourse
Of “great events” and “tips.”
He told me then he stood to win
A fi’ pun' note or two,
Upon a “certain” prophecy—
I doubt if it came true.
And once again I see this youth,
No betting:book is there:
The prison scissors close have cropped
His once luxuriant hair.
They tell that “cleaned” completely “out,”
He closed his short career
By bolting with his master's till,
When “settling” time drew near.
I see him shipped—the Government
His passage out will pay:
And at some penal settlement,
He'll spend his Settling Day.
A Doubtful Victory.
The “America” has this year been beaten by British
sailors. But on this occasion she was manned with British
sailors too.

THE following estimate will illustrate the absurdity to which the
practice of paying hotel servants—independently of the regular char
-may be carried. We take a sandwich as the subject of our calcula:
tions, for, of course, every servant who has had a hand, in preparing it
is entitled, as much as the waiter, to get a slice out of it.

And the Union’s accordingly selling it low.
At Camberwell, too, you will hear it with groans—
They haven't a pauper to break up the stones,
And are going to advertise—such is the fact—
For hands by whose labour the flints may be crack'd.
And these are the fearful results of Free Trade;
We shall soon have no beggars, I’m almost afraid;
And unless the sad prospect. before us deceives,
There’ll be even a great falling off in the thieves.
A Pretty Safe Prophecy.
We do not generally put ourselves up for prophets; but, judging
from the result of the present elections, we think we can safely
tºphesy that the mystery of the something which is “looming in the
uture”, is settled now beyond a doubt. It is the dismissal of the

PERILS OF PIC-NICS.
MR. Pipkin MAKES A vigorous BUT UNsuccessFUL EFFORT TO SECURE “That DARLING
WATER LILY.”
EMIGRATE.
THE present rage is Emigration. If it goes on at this rate, there
will be no one but ourselves left in England. The great pity is, that
some of the best people in England—all the labouring classes—the
persons who enrich the country, are leaving it. . The producers are
going, and we shall have none but the consumers left. What then are
we to do? for we look upon ourselves, partly, as consumers. If there
is no market for our jokes—no one to buy them—not one happy soul
left to laugh at them—it is clear Mr. Punch must starvel or go into
the workhouse. It is under these starvation-looking prospects, that
Mr. Punch ventures to lay down certain rules and regulations as to the
Persons and Things only that should emigrate.
He divides these rules and regulations into two classes—social and
political.
Of the political, he recommends the following to emigrate as soon as
possible:–
THE IRISH BRIGADE to emigrate to Rome. They do no kind of good
in England, are only in the way of legislation—whereas they might be
W. to great advantage in blowing the “Pope's Brass Band” in the
aulcan.
THE PROTECTIONIST FARMERs, who are always declaring that it is
impossible to get a living now in England. As they cannot live here,
why don't they try to live elsewhere?
ALL Those Pensioneks on THE PENSION LIST who have never
done anything to deserve the money they pocket every year. Of course,
when they are recommended to emigrate, it is understood that they are
to leave the money they annually receive behind them.
ALL THE YouNGER Sons of THE Nobility, who have not been
pushed into the Army or Navy. As it is indispensably necessary, it
seems, to have soldiers and sailors, they may as well be noblemen as
not, so long as they fight well, and do not run away. But all the younger
AGRICULTURAL SWEATERS.
MR. MEchI, at his annual agricultural
réunion, complained that the farmers did
little or nothing in the way of education
for their labourers. He urged that before
much good could be done, much bad
must be tradicated, and he suggested
“drainage of heads” as being equally
necessary with “drainage of lands.” We
think the farmers practise the art of
draining heads pretty freely upon the
labourers, if not upon themselves, for they
certainly manage to get as much sweat
as can be obtained from the brows of their
workmen.

sons, who are waiting for Ambassador-ships, Secretary-ships, and Attaché-
º and other kind of Ships on which there is no fighting, and very
little work and very handsome pay, should emigrate as quickly as their
debts will allow them, and see what they can do to earn a living in
another country.
With the Younger Sons of the Nobility, LoRD MANNERs might also
go. He has such a love for every thing in the shape of a .
that he should emigrate by all means with the darling objects of his
affections, and seek some land that flourishes without “arts and
science, laws and learning.”
LoRD MAIDSTONE should accompany LoRD MANNERs. They are
the two }. poets of the present Ministry. As he has prophesied
that the Deluge must come, we should isis. him to get out of
England as fast as he can, unless he has a particular desire to be
drowned in it.
LoRD MALMESBURY might take the same hint, as he has done every-
...” lower the character of England, and consequently is no longer
worthy to remain in it.
All YoUNG GUARDSMEN, who, poor fellows, have nothing to do, and
amuse themselves º running into debt and gambling, and pelting
harmless persons with peas and flour and rotten eggs.
CARDINAL WISEMAN–ſor obvious reasons: for we are sure his emi-
gration from England would be hailed by all classes (excepting, perhaps,
his own) with the greatest delight. Let him go on a voyage of discovery
for some happy, papish country, where he can grow, after his own
fancy the “little Paradise,” which he has not yet succeeded in planting
round Westminster Abbey.
All Puseyites—BENNETTs—and those pendulum-clergymen, who
keep vibrating between Protestantism and Popery, had better follow the
Cardinal's worthy example. They only breed dissension and scandal
by ºnius in England. They had better join the Pope as soon as
possible.
Of the social class, the following might take the hint which we now
generously give them, to leave the country as soon as their affairs will

DOUBLE DEALINGS.
DEVOTED Protectionist of my acquaint-
ance, Mr. Punch, who is also a most
determined Free Trader, having some:
thing of a poetical turn, has, twisted
some of his friends' late hustings
speeches into the following ditty.
Possibly, Mr. Punch, under your
patronage, it may beguile the sorrows
of the wealthy farmer to get it by
heart, and occasionally sing it. The
air (Garry Owen) is easily acquired by
the most aboriginal.
“Yours truly,
“A FREE TRADER LIKE CHRISTOPHER,
“AND A PROTECTIONIST LIKE
DIsRAELI.”
THE CREED OF THE DERBYITE.
BROTHER ELECTORs,
The little account you'll have from
me
As clear as mud is going to be,
So put any question you like to try
And I only wish you may get a reply,
Sing DERby, Dizzy, and glory !
For the poor man's loaf I shall
certainly vote, ... . .
And I wish it may stick in the poor
man's throat;
And all “the old women” may drink"cheap tea,”
And visibly swell, if they please, for me,
Sing DERby, Dizzy, and glory !
I want cheap sugar, cheap beer, cheap law,
For “the vilest rabble that ever I saw,”
And I’m all for the people, or rather “the mob,
Whom I loathe and scorn,” like a bit of a snob,
Sing DERby, Dizzy, and glory !
I'll make you respected all the world round,
For each floor'd §. I'll ask ten pound,
And press for a “compensation” meet,
And fall on my knees at NERO's feet
Sing MALMESBURY, MATHER, and glory !
I go for reforming every abuse,
And I think Reform is the very deuce,
And I’ll never restore the tax on grain,
And I swear Free Trade is ruin and bane,
Sing DERby, Dizzy, and glory.
All men shall follow what faith they choose,
And we’ll sack the chapels, and brand the Jews;
And no one shall suffer because of his creed,
So vote for a DISRAELITE indeed,
And sing DERby, DIzzy, and glory !
MOSSES FROM AN OLD CATHEDRAL,
THERE has been a very pleasant book, by a very pleasant American
writer, published here under the name of Mosses from an old Manse.
Is there, not something smacking_of_graceful, old sentiment, and, a
certain pious stillness in that title? One can interest oneself in the
routine of a quiet imaginative life in an old Manse very well. -
But it is our benevolent nature, reader, to see in everything-
literary and other—the possibility of some good being done to our
respectable countrymen. This is no affectation, BLOGG !—We never
contemplated in the green solitude of the country some quiet white
lake, without ºf how nice it would be if the Black Brothers of
the Order of St. Anthony could be induced to lave themselves. No.
We never saw in a country village a deserted, grass-covered pound,
without thinking of a Protectionist. - - - - - -
So, now to apply this remark to the subject in hand, which is always
better than beating about the bush. What we want is to suggest to
some novelist to do, for the benefit of the public, Mosses from an old-
Cathedral. Reader, do you smell a rat P Possibly, probably, you do,
for we are verging on the subject of corruption: in truth, we want, to
see our novelist apply himself to the illustration of such Cathedral
questions as those opened by the case of MR. WHISTON.
How the imagination, perching itself in some holy nook, of a
Cathedral (after paying sixpence entrance fee to the verger), could pro-
ceed to gather, mosses from the contemplation of the scene The
marble knights lying so still there, with their ºf: crossed—do the
not symbolise the stony silence of DR. MUFFIN, when a voice is raise
about the abuses of his trusts? The epitaphs on the vaulted floors—
over which you stroll so carelessly; how calmly—how like the Doctor,
their owners lie-minding not what feet are tramping on their names
and honour-so that their peace be not disturbed. The odd, quaint
cherubs perched against the walls with eyes upwards—what are these
but the little MUFFINs, gazing up at the º things in prospect aloft,
and comfortably kept in their position by being firmly stuck to the
walls?
Then, look at the high golden pipes of the huge organ aloft there.
Imagination is awed by the thought of the music, sleeping in its bul
like the thunder in a summer cloud, till imagination thinks again o
DR. MUFFIN, and reflects how his thought is but of the bellows—how
everything in the Cathedral, as in the organ, depends on the raising of
the wind.
The painted windows, too, which seem, every time the sun comes
out and lights them, to be taking perpetual daguerreotypes of the
figures of saints and angels somewhere in the airl The spectator
muses on them, and again—for the doom is on him—has to think of
MUFFIN. What is that reverend man, but the image of a real priest
—the odd motionless copy of something that was once real, and alive?
There he stands in ecclesiastic garb—between the congregation, and
heaven's light. - -
Such strange, interesting stories might be written by the novelist in
pursuing our idea, , Strolling along by the tombs of gentlemen who left .
slices of their land to found schools-schools that might remain living
atonements for some too hot deed of the fiery-hearted gentlemen—he
would dwell on the fate these schools have met. He would remember
how the benefit of them has all gone one way—and that way the wrong
one; how, when a tree of knowledge has been planted in a district
by a pious hand, the fruit has gone to the fat neighbour who kept it,
and only bits of bark and withered leaves to the poor for whom it was
intended. Imagination would see the figures of the people interested,
and would be able to single out two, perhaps; watch the course of the
poor boy who, with a right that he *new not of to a share of the dead
gentleman's legacy, struggled through a life that education might have
made a great one; and watch the rotund and prosperous trustee, with
a comfortable conscience baptised in Port, the founder of a race of
pluralists and sinecurists, Members of Parliament, and preservers of
game ! Our novelist would see strange contrasts indeed; strange
developments from simple beginnings. Might he not trace the dust of
the dead founder, till he found it stopping a little hole in a corrupt
institution to shut out the light?
Might he not make a little parable to show how the legacies of old
founders go? A certain DE LANCEY DE CHEyAL planted a bean-stalk,
directing certain pious men to employ a sum of money in keeping it up,
to supply beans to the poor, Two hundred years pass. Beans are
grown infinitely cheaper, but the money has increased so as to admit of
the trustees serving out beans of gold. Notwithstanding this they keep
the money, and give the poor the original old bean, now procurable at
º: a peck.
hen the novelist strolled out from the Cathedral, a glance at the
exterior would tell him what sort of opposition the reformer has to
anticipate. Glancing along the edges of the roof, he sees dog-faces and
fiend-faces gibbering at him—gibbering hideously there from morning
to night at all comers. There they grin to protect the building (so the
speculative eye fancies) for ever. Happily contrived, too, are they—
for when the cleansing rain falls, they quietly disgorge it, and send it
pouring out, on the earth. Meanwhile, the daws chatter aloft; the
starlings build in the eaves; everything tells of Conservatism, and looks
as if it was to last for ever. There is plenty of room, truly, for gather-
*::: inside and around the venerable pile !
he sentimentalist could not fail, doubtless, to note how Time
manages to make everything more or less holy, . A coin of TIBERIUs
has its value, just as well as a coin of the best king that ever lived.
Think you the Geographical Society would not unroll the mummy of a
beggar with all the delight in the word? You abuse Pontius Pilate,
but if MR. BARNUM was to bring him alive to London, do you suppose
that all Pimlico wouldn't have him “in the evening?”
Thus it is (might our imaginary author reflect) that the antiquity
of, DR. Murrin's office sayes him from being properly over-hauled:
Like a lean old goose, his safety from being roasted is in his “venerable”
character. And what is there that won't get “venerable” with due
luck? Do you know the natural history of a Fairy Ring? That magic
circle, that charmed enclosure sacred to the supernatural dance, is-
(Woollaston has proved it)—is–that holy ring, we say—is formed
by the growth of mushrooms and toadstools in the grass!
Election Returns.
We do not wish to be severe upon any one who has met with a mis-
fortune; but the best thing LoRD DERby can do with these
“Returns” is to put them in his pipe and smoke them.

SOME REALLY ODIOUS COMPARISONS.
USTOM and our copy-books
have always taught us that
comparisons are odious, but
why they are more odious
than Superlatives, or half so
Se7; as positives, we have
never had any definite idea,
nor have we been at much
|. to inquire. It did,
owever, occur to us a few
days ago, while walking, near
the River Thames and in-
haling an odour for which we
could find no comparison half
horrible enough, it did, we
say, occur to us, and we said
to ourselves in the words of
the “nonsense poet"—
“At such a moment let us ask"
whycomparisons in general are
unanimously voted odious 2
We immediately began to
turn over in our mind, and
rummage in the untidy draw-
ers of our memory, or turn
out the higgledy-piggledycu
boards of the past, where old
recollections are put away to
- - - - be sorted at some time or
| * *sº-ſº d; other—which never comes—
and we managed to muster a
few “comparisons,” which
are certainly enough to bring odium upon the whole of their order.
They are deficient in aptitude or truth, and we have only to cite three
or four to show that if comparisons are generally odious, there are
some of them that deserve to be so, on account of their endeavouring
to obtain credit under false pretences.
As merry as a grip is a comparison with which every one is familiar,
but we will venture to lay fifty pounds—of atmospheric air—to a plum,
that in the first place nobody ever saw a grig, and that if such an
unusual interview has ever taken place as the meeting of one of our
readers and a grig, the former perceived in the latter no signs whatever
of merriment. A grig is defined by Johnson as-first, “a Bavarian
duck,” and then “a small eel,”—an option which displays a good deal
of the old showman spirit of “whichever you please, my little dear, you
pays your money and you takes your choice,” on the part of the great
lexicographer. The merriment of a Bavarian duck is a question we
| cannot, “in the absence of the party,” be expected to go into; but, as
to the other representative of the grig–the little eel—we defy the
keenest observer to extract from its contortions, which seem dictated
by an instinctive desire to wriggle out of the way of getting skinned,
the least spark of merriment.
As regular as clock-work is another absurdity, as may be ascertained
by inquiring at almost any of the public clocks; for even the Horse
Guards, which has enjoyed some reputation, has been once or twice
caught in a state which proves that Nullum horologium omnibus horis
sapit.
As sure as a gun is another of those comparisons that cannot hold
good in a country like ours, where, in the first place, our old military
muskets are sure of nothing but of missing their aim; to say nothing
of the frightful uncertainty of so many of our sportsmen's guns, which
are often as dangerous in the hand of a friend, as in that of an
enemy.
. As clear as the sun at noon-day may be all very well for a few weeks
in June, but such a comparison is by no means adapted even then for
everyday use; and the little truth it contains savours much less of the
rule than of the exception.
As drunk as a lord is another comparison against which we are happy
to be able to protest, for we think that sobriety and decency have found
their way upwards even to the once dissolute portion of the aristocracy;
the other version of the comparison, as drunk as a pig, may be allowe
to without objection.
e could #. on multiplying instances by the yard, or even by the
mile, by the day, week, month, or year; but we think we have cited
quite sufficient to show why it is that .. have come into dis-
repute, and have been pronounced generally odious.
we DON'T BELIEVE A word of IT.
THERE is a youth at the diggings so tarnation fast that he lights his
cigar always with a flash of lightning.
—
HUMAN KITTENS AND BLIND PUPPIES.
Among the female fashions for the present season, the Assize reports
indicate infanticide as very prevalent. One Louisa WALBoRN, indicted
at Dorchester Assizes for the murder of her little boy, was acquitted
on evidence so conclusive—if true—of her guilt, and after a summing
up so decidedly against her, that the jury must either have thought the
witnesses perjurers, and the judge a blockhead, or have looked upon
the child as a flea or a rat—or preferred breaking their solemn oaths to
concurrence towards the dislocation of a woman's neck. “We may
do what we like now !” was the jovial exclamation of several young
mothers out of Court, on hearing of this satisfactory verdict. Soon,
in Dorsetshire and elsewhere, we shall have maternal affection dis.
playing itself at the druggists’ counter, by requests for strychnine
º prussic acid, “just to poison the babies.”
To prevent this consummation, it will be of no use for Punch to write
leading articles. Common jurymen take in beer only, and not Punch ;
besides, the very strongest Punch never would get into their heads.
It is greatly to be feared—for the sake of MR. CALCRAFT and his
friends—that the only way out of this difficulty is the repeal of the
gallows. When this tree virtually affords a shelter to criminals, had
you not better cut it down? Now that the Black Drop is found to
º, the juryman's moral sense, is it not time to leave off that
physic:
‘Aut Caesar aut nullus,” translated “neck or ºff" is your
present criminal law maxim in regard to child-murder, and impunity
results. Now, sure transportation is clearly preferable to fortuitous
hanging and probable escape: and one casual gaol-bird in the hand of
the law's finisher, is not worth two certain convicts, out of the bush.
It is useless to try and build buttresses to the scaffold, and to hold
on by the rope any longer: you had better turn Jack Ketch himself
off. We shall still have plenty of popular entertainments when you
have abolished the spectacle of executions, with the yelling crowds,
busy É. brutal jests, jangling, knell, solemn parson, pompous
sheriffs, revolting hangman, ghastly culprit, grote que nightcap, white
handkerchief, plunge, check, death-struggles, last dying speech and
confession, and all the fun of Hang Fair.

1847, might have added
the misrepresentation of
Westminster to his other
misrepresentations, if we
had not prevented him.
He has since been seekin
“ popularity " throug
the cheaper medium of
a soup-kitchen supported
by charitable contribu-
tions, and a staff of street
orderlies, engaged in some
very dirty work, which is
too often the ſate of those
who are engaged in the
service of a pseudo-philan-
thrºpist. hese “order-
lies” have been employed
in the ignoble occupation
of picking up every im-
purity they could find in
the streets; but, when a
chance presented itself of
assisting pauperism to
- rise to a state of dignified
industry in another country, MR. CochRANE began to feel that in
the absence of misery and destitution, his occupation as a puffing
philanthropist would be gone.
To give to the poor the means of putting bread into their own mouths,
would be figuratively to empty MR. CochRANE's mouth of all those
frothy clap-traps upon ºl. has lived for the last three or four years,
as a professor of the art of philanthropy, which may be ranked in these
days as one of the humane sciences. A proposition having been made to
give to some F. the benefit of a boon, for which thousands of
respectable working men are willing to Fº: boon of emigration—has
thrown MR. CochRANE into a state of rabid alarm and excitement, lest
the material of misery upon which he has carried on his trade of philan-
thropy at home, should be converted into comfort in the colonies. A
philanthropist who would keep up a supply of wretchedness and poverty
as food for his philanthropy, is like a parson who would encourage
wickedness in order that he might have something to preach about.
MR. CochRANE may as well shut | shop as a trading philanthropist
forthwith, now that he has shown that he cares less for the sufferings
of those who labour under the disease of poverty, than for his own
notoriety as a quack in finding nostrums for it.
We are happy to find that the ratepayers of St. Martin’s have
decided against MR. CochRANE's theory that wretchedness ought not
to be converted into prosperity, lest the philanthropist should be left
without a theme for his own self-glorification. After the display he
recently made of his qualifications for taking part in a public discussion,
-when he apostrophised the chairman as “old fellow,” and met the
refusal to put a libellous resolution with an exclamation of “Won't
you, by Jove, but we'll make you though,”—the electors of Westminster
will be doubly grateful to us for having saved them from the disgrace
of sending such a person to Parliament.

Scotch Mineralogy.
The Glasgow. Mail says, that some workmen employed in making
excavations in front of the Infirmary of that city, ; among other
curiosities, “a stone strongly impregnated with sulphur, of a similar
description to that which was recently mistaken in Fifeshire for the
genuine gold ore.”. Vulgar. English prejudice would scarcely have
supposed that Scotchmen could have ºl. anything else for gold—
certainly not anything of the nature of sulphur. It must now, how-
ever, admit that the Scottish appetite for the “yellow dross” has been
over-estimated, and that the sons of Caledonia have been a great deal
too “much condemned to have an itching palm.”

MR. Mechi will eclipse his own magic strop if he shall succeed in
sharpening rusty agricultural blades.
THE DERBY WOTER'S SOLILOQUY.
(Spoken in a darkened doorway, with his face to the wall.)
Is this a sovereign which I feel behind me,
Slipp'd gently into my hand P Come, let me sack thee:
Art thou not, precious metal, sensible
To vision as to touch? or art thou but
A sovereign of the mind, a false sensation,
Proceeding from the beer-oppressed brain?
I feel thee yet, a coin as palpable
As this I now produce.
Thou hint'st to me the side whereon I’m going;
And such a candidate I am to choose.
My conscience is the weakest of my senses,
Which should rule all the rest. I feel thee still—
A blade that has no gudgeon in his blood,
I ne'er was sold before. Pooh! no such thing:
It is the freeman's privilege which informs
Thus to mine eyes. Now throughout all the land
Protection's dead; and wicked bribes abuse
The voter's trust: now Coppock celebrates
Corruption's offerings; and cunning EDwards,
Subduing easy principle with pelf,
Prowls on the watch, and thus with hidden face
The stumpy lavishes wide towards his design,
Mute as a post. Ye men of sense and worth,
Mark not . course, which way I vote, for fear
My very looks show I’ve been tamper'd with ;
And take the present honour from my name,
That now rests with it. Whiles I yet shall live,
Votes I for treats and feeds and gold will give.
I go and plump anon: the chink invites me.
Hear it not, BEREsford' for ’tis a knell
That summons thee to follow JAcob BELL!
THE LAW MILITANT.
The “Church Militant” has long been a familiar term; but there
seems to us to be a very considerable analogy between the practice of
the camps and the practice of the courts—a striking resemblance
between an ordinary field of action, and the field of an action at law.
Most of the military expressions in use at the present day are applicable
to lawyers' as well as soldiers’ practice; and, indeed, before going into
legal action, it is customary to inquire whether the party to be
attacked is “worth powder, and shot.” The drilling of a corps of
lawyers for sharp practice might be carried on very nearly in the words
of the drill sergeant, the only alteration that would be necessary
being shown by the following examples:—
For Draw Swords Read Draw Bills.
ry Fix Bayonets r: Fix Clients.
in Recover Arms n Recover Costs.
n Present Arms 11 Present Writs.
There are several directions which are equally applicable to either
service, and we need only mention “Charge” and “Fall Out,” as
familiar instances: for “charging” is the lawyer's delight, while
“falling out” is the client's privilege. There is, however, one
exception—perhaps the one necessary to prove the rule—as to the
analogy between legal and military practice, for though it is common in
the latter to hear the word given to “stand at ease,” we know that
with those engaged in law the operation of standing at ease is quite
impossible.
THE CHURCH AND THE CONSERVATIVES.
At the BEREsford Braintree dinner, held at the White Hart, the
Rev. M.R. MAGENDIE said, responding to a toast—
“There was a charm which he could not describe, and a warm feeling which came over
them when the affairs of this country were administered by a purely Conservative
Government.”
Could not describe? This was at the White Hart. Now, we under-
stand that the Rev. Gentleman's clerk, supping the same night at the
Black Pig, could describe what his master could not. The clerk said—
“I tell you what it is—it's just this. When the Tories is in, the loaves is bigger,
and the fishes is sweeter. Rolls is peck loaves, and sprats is whales.”
We put it to the Rev. Gentleman,—is not this his meaning, more
happily as more guilelessly expressed ?
The Grand Possibility.
WE hope we now see the possibility, which MR. DisBAELI alluded
to as looming in the future, not farther off than the next session of
Parliament. A recently published report, proposed to a Parliamentary
Select Committee by Vº HUME, abundantly shows that it is perſectly
possible to effect an equitable adjustment of the Income-Tax.

though) with a sharp eye to “windward,” (where, however, there is no
possible danger to be apprehended) and your telescope carried with
peculiar knowingness. By the way, I don't know any test of the finished
yachtsman better than the way in which he carries his “Dollond.” Be
not betrayed, on the strength of all this, into too hasty areliance on your
acquirements. If I went up in MR. GREEN's balloon, it would be very
absurd in me to dictate to that “veteran” as to throwing the ballast
out, and the like: remember that you are still in the same innocence
about seamanship. There can be no harm, for the present, in getting
a very big chart and pricking it all about with a pair of compasses. You
won't prog your fingers above once or twice at first, and meanwhile you
will be in the way of learning something. “GUNTER's scale” (need I
caution you against jesting on “GUNTER's carte,” &c.?) is a most useful
scientific instrument, and ought to be carefully studied by all who
pretend to navigation.
Then, a harmless fund of entertainment presents itself in the signal
department. The Argonauts use, I think, Blogg's system; I know
that many a fine intellect has employed itself in perfecting signal
COmmunication.
Indeed I was once signal midshipman myself, in the Sea Cook, 16,
but, from hopeless perplexity of intellect when the went up, was

º - -
At all events, you can fift yourself no end of amusement—and, shall
I say, a little importance?—by working your signal flags. Thus: “For-
ward there!”. you cry; “send Hug aſt!!!” For the Bubble, we will
suppose, is lying a couple of cable's lengths from the Parvenu-young
LEBson's cutter; and you are going to communicate with P. (who is
sprawling on a Persian rug aft, with a pipe in his mouth, and watching
the claret cooling in flannel bags over a green tub.)
So Hug comes running aft, and touches his hat, of course—(confess,
my dear boy, that you feel a thrill of command then)—and, forthwith,
you commence signalling to PLEBson, whom you could inform of all
your wishes in three minutes per dingy:—
“3 24 2–' Look out !” B. 4. 2. X-' Salad!’”
and PLEBSON, the wag' hoists in reply a strange combination, which,
aſter much puzzling, is discovered to be “WALKER!”
—
Meanwhile, the people on shore are thrown into great excitement by
all this display of flags, and conclude that, they bear, some important
reference to the sailing of the America, or the witch-like movements of
the Poppet. . Of course, you are profound already on the real causes of
the superiority of the America?. Sometimes it is her “rig,” and then
it is her “ §§ and then she is only a “New York pilot-boat,” and
in, she is “only fit for a stiff breeze.”. But everybody agrees that
if some one thing—nobody agrees what in particular—were somehow
other than it is—his craft would beat her? Don't you think the
Bubble would? To me, the way in which you fellows talk about the
America is like the way one sometimes hears ladies talk about a pretty
girl. To be sure, her mouth is nice enough, or there is something
attractive about her eyes, to be sure, but— Meanwhile, like her sea
prototype, the mystic charmer is going ahead of the whole of them:
I know you to be naturally a good-natured fellow, so it is perhaps
hardly fair to warn you how to act in the matter of electing new fellows
into the Imperial Argonauts. It is not necessary, I believe, to beg you
not to say—swaggering about the club-rooms, or carelessly lounging at
the balcony—“Oh hang it, you know, what does he want to be in
for?” It is all very well for Fitz-OFFAL to be going about shrugging
his shoulders, and saying the club's not what it used to be, when we
know that he offered his interest to get in a pork-butcher on condition
of the poor fellow’s buying the Diddler, at goodness, knows how much
over the value! Oh, that Diddler; how the deuce does she swim with
all those bills on board? Leave this kind of thing, I say, to Fitz O.
and to those extraordinary “swells” who haunt sea-port places, and
torment honest fellows who “pay their way”—“swells” who drawl out,
“Ah, FoRBEssy " when you are introduced to them.“What Forbessys

AN
ASS IN
A LEOPARD’S SKIN.
ERHAPs there never, was a more
startling instance of what it is to
live, not merely by the sweat of
one's brow, but by the perspiration
of one's whole body, than is shown
by the individual who stands at the
door of CUMMING's Exhibition in
a complete suit of leopard skins.
The Exhibition is intended to
illustrate the triumph of human
courage over brute force; but the
man in the leopard skins should
be endowed with a heart of stone
and nerves of iron, to resist, the
furnace heat to which he is daily
subjected. If the thermometer is
80 in the sun, we should like to
know what it is in the pocket of
this poor creature's paletot ? We
expect to see him drop down some
day a mass_of_human tallow, with
the flame of life dimly ºff.
his eye by way of socket. The
unhappy victim creeps occasionally
on to an adjacent railing of iron,
as if he would fain place himself
on a sort of save-all, but we fear
- ...the thread of his life is reduced
to a wick, which is being rapidly consumed by the burning ſever into
which he is thrown by the furs that envelop him.
We, often feel that it would be an act, of mercy to place him under
the adjacent pump, and though he might object to the proceeding in the
heat of the moment, he would appreciate it upon cooler reflection, We
have heard of a person being ready to jump out of his skin, with joy,
and we are convinced that the happiest event of this individual's life
will be his jumping out of his leopard skins. We trust we have said
nothing to hurt the poor fellow's feelings, but having daily opportunities
of observing that he is by no means thin-skinned, we have not scrupled
É *...* the subject of a few remarks, which we hope will be for
is benefit.
THE DOUBLE-FACED MINISTRY.
A GENTLEMAN, connected with a very reputable card-cheating case
that has lately edified the sporting-houses and betting-offices of the
metropolis, was taken up, and several coins with two heads were found
in his possession. These coins had evidently been used for gambling
and deceitful purposes. This is, of course, very dreadful, but we know
a Ministry that has lately, been playing their game upon the same
gambling principle. They have been sending their money far and wide
into the country, and every º: of it has been stamped with two
heads. These two heads were Free Trade and Protection. If a county
cried Free Trade, up went the coin, and it was sure to come down with
the face of Free Trade turned uppermost... If, on the contrary, the
county cried Protection, nothing was easier than to turn the coin the
opposite way, and to let that side be uppermost which the electors
were anxious to see the winning side. In this way the ministerial coin
did double duty, and won twice where, otherwise, it could not have
won more than once...The Ministry came down, it is, said, with
thousands in #. this game, not only at iſerby, but at several
other places. . In most instances the trick was successful, but in a few
it was exposed, and the parties practising it were hooted with contempt
out of the town.
It, remains, however, to be proved whether they will gain much
eventually by the fraud, for when Parliament meets, and the Ministry
has to face it, it will be quite a toss-up, whether, with their two faces | W
even, it will be able to stand after the first throw. The country's eyes are
opened, now, to the imposition, and we are afraid the first throw will
be for the Ministry what in tossing is called “Sudden Death.” We
should have stated before, º we thought it quite unnecessary, that
the name of this Ministry, with two heads, is, as the reader knows well
enough without our telling him—“The DERby MINISTRY.” Its game
is completely up.
The Wote Market.
ALTHOUGH the influence of the Crown may not have been, to an
very great extent, unduly exerted at the late election, there is too much
reason for fearing that some ministerial candidates have awfully abused
the power of the Sovereign.
MoTTo FOR A Postage STAMP.-"A penny for your thoughts.”
HOMAGE TO PANIZZI.
It is impossible to speak in terms of too strong eulogy of the
activity and zeal which have been lately displayed in the execution of
his office, by
SIGNOR PANIZZI,
LIBRARIAN OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM.
For years past the papers have teemed with unreasonable complaints
of the chaotic and incomplete state of the catalogue of that national
institution, the arrangement of which was the duty of the Signor. He,
all the while, was labouring with preternatural diligence at a task com-
parable º: that of the DANAIDEs, or to the job assigned by the
celebrated Michael Scott to the importunate demon on the sea-shore.
We are happy to announce that he has now completed his great work,
having thus entirely, snuffed out the glory of Johnson's Dictionary:
and now, having nothing else or better to do, than to go on continually
bringing his stupendous performance nearer and nearer to perfection,
he has been assiduously, indefatigably, and inexorably summoning
before the magistrates every delinquent publisher who may have
omitted by some oversight to transmit to the Museum, as by law
required, a copy of a twopenny-halfpenny pamphlet.
WANITY WERSUS EMIGRATION.
SoNG FOR A CockRoach.
CoME, all of you whom BERESFORD perhaps would call the rabble,
I want you to create a row, to halloo, hiss, and gabble;
Run at my heels, ye ragged rout, whose class the paupers yields,
Follow me to the vestry of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields.
You know there is a scheme a-foot to raise a penny rate,
To help you to transport yourselves—they say, to emigrate,
To quit your alleys, courts, and lanes, wherein you love to be,
And go to far Australia from your parish-and from me.
They’d have you leave the soup-kitchen where gratis you are fed,
To work and drudge in other lands for mutton and for bread;
They want you to desert the streets which you with ease can sweep,
To rake in other mud for gold, or slave at tending sheep.
Can highest shepherd's wages, richest jº. make amends
For being torn from cherished slums, and pals, and public friends?
You love your old back settlements, though full of sinks and drains,
Far more than those new colonies, for all their golden plains.
Attend me to the meeting then, called, with designing views
Of ousting you from British Yards, and Rows, and Rents, and Mews;
Interrupt it, bawl and bellow, strain your throats in making noise,
And with hubbub and with clamour put discussion down, my boys.
Their object’s to get rid of you, as you, of course, must know,
But don't let them come over you-I'd not consent to gº:
Because 'twould suit their purpose—though I might, in distant lands,
Earn a comfortable living, and be taken off their hands.
Pack off the parish poor, indeed!-oh, that will never do!
I can't at any price, my friends, afford the loss of you;
Your shoulders, needy multitude, to stand on I require,
An eminent philanthropist, for people to admire.
If you were gone, there soon would be an end of all my fame,
And never in the papers more should I behold my name;
No longer, by the stir I make, attract the public gaze,
Nor live, of motoriety surrounded by a blaze.
Then stay at home, my º friends—dear objects of relief-
Desert your benefactor, and he’ll die of very grief;
hilst you, in independence fed and clad, are far away,
And nobody for Cockroach will be left to cry. Hooray!
Encouragement for (Chevaliers of) Industry.
SoME alteration must be made in the laws which º speculative
societies. The operations of the “Australian Gold ºf and Emi-
gration Company,” exposed the other day at the Mansion House before
SIR. Robert CARDEN, strongly suggest the necessity of taking measures
for providing the members of fraudulent joint-stock companies with
joint stocks.
THE EXTREME ANIMAL.
A certAIN gentleman is so great a stickler for the combination, of
spiritual with secular teaching, that he never gives, instructions to his
attorney without at the same time delivering him a lecture on divinity.

PITY TIII: 80RROWS UF THE POOR POLICE.
“LoR, Soosan How's A Feller to eat Meat such Weath ER. As this. Now, A Bit
o' Pickled SALMen and Cowcumber, or a LobstER Salid Might do.”
A GRAWE ACCUSATION.
Most of the recent changes in the law have been
such as we can approve, but we cannot say as much
for a new rule which will take effect on the 24th
of October, by which a suit is not to cease on the
death of either the defendant or the plaintiff. To
continue litigation in the name of or against the
dead, is to carry a quarrel beyond the grave; and,
surely, when a man has paid the debt of nature he
may be allowed to rest in peace, even though his
other obligations may remain unsatisfied. If he
could be brought to life again by a bill of reviver
"here might be some reason for the new rule, but to
call upon a deceased party to “appear,” is a pro-
ceeding worthy of an invocation of ZAMIEL. There
is something awful in the idea of carrying on a suit
against the dead, which will include the service of
notices at his “last place of abode,” and perhaps the
filing of all sorts of documents on the railings of
the cemeteries, which will be hung henceforth with
writs by way of immortelles, or other funereal appen-
dages. We hope the first lawyer who undertakes to
carry on a suit against a dead man will be met by
the defunct with “spirit,” and the entry of an
“appearance” after a fashion that the man of law
may not anticipate.
Calling Persons by their Proper Names.
The name of one of Louis NApoleon's aide-de-
camps is Roguet. If the last letter of this name
were dropped, it would then be beautifully appro-
priate for the servant of such a master. This might
easily be done, as we all know that Louis NAPOLEoN,
in the choice of his associates, has never been
“particular to a t.”
BLUE-Bottle's Motto.—“Blow high, blow low.”
BLENHEIM SPANIELS AND WOODSTOCK"
PUPPETS.
It is a strange fact that has no less strangely escaped the vigilance
of DoD, that at certain seasons, certain folks in Oxfordshire, at other
times biped, sentient men, become, for a time, spaniels and wooden
puppets. They can bark, can just bow-wow, yes and no; and can
squeak the like syllables. How the transformation originated we
cannot rightly say; but the olden time of fairy, as MR. KEightLEY
will testify, is full of such changes; witness the seals that, when they
list, can take of their seal-skin and a pear as young ladies. We wish,
before the next edition of the Fairy i. that its learned author
would take a trip into Oxfordshire. For we should like to know the
origin of the transformation above spoken of. In the meanwhile, we
have merely toºft. a correct copy of the MARQUIs of BLANDroRD's
address: an address that, we grieve to say, has been shamefully
garbled. However, the Redfion of Brentford may blush, but not.—
no, on second thoughts we will give the Marquis's address, and not
be personal.
“SPANIELS AND PUPPETs—I have delayed addressing you, because
I hadn't determined whether I should or not. However, as I have
a few words to throw to the "...i goes.
“You know that I always advocated your interests. No man has
been louder in praise of the length of your ears, oh spaniels; no one
more readily allows the suppleness of your joints, oh puppets.
. “The connexion has been long between us... I hardly remember the
time when you would not sit upon your hind legs at the word—when
!. would not respond to the wire at the pull. For you have ever
een spaniels of the right Blenheim breed—puppets of the same
wood that grew, the baton of the first MARLBoRough.
“I have . you to jump over a stick at the cry of “Church and
State,’ and to howl at democracy. You have squeaked, ‘Up with the
loaf, and down with the Radicals.”
“When our Church—that is, # Church—for, as I crushingly observed
to a certain person at Brentford, I have all the Church to myself—well,
then, when my Church is assailed even in its weathercock, I take the
attack as personal. Kick but a tombstone, and I feel it all over.
... “But in these times men wear masks. hdifference to Church rates
is called philosophy; and the Liberal, to show that he will tolerate all
religions, would embrace the infidel who has none.
“The ultra doctrines of democracy are fascinating, but dangerous.
There are men who would invade the hearth of property, like black-
- --- ——º-
beetles; and without paying a half-crown at the gate (five shillings, if a
party of three) wander insultingly through the halls of Blenheim.
“Against these doctrines I stand, gentlemen. I have been much
abused—but I like abuse. The swallow builds her nest with mud.
The true saint warms himself in the dirt that's cast upon him.
“Gentlemen—I mean, spaniels and puppets—my feelings may have
been wounded; but what of it? Crush spices, and they smell the
sweeter; my feelings have been pounded, and—but you will judge what
follows. It becomes not me to make an inference.
“Had I been as fortunate as my merits and my humility entitled
me—(but I can wait)—at Middlesex, our connexion would have ceased.
You would still have worn collars; #. would still have been pulled by
wires: the only difference would have been this—the collars would
have borne another name; the strings would have been twitched by
other fingers.
“I have the honour to be your—no, I mean you have the honour to
be my–obedient spaniels and puppets “BLANDFORD.”
This address, when read at the Marlborough's Head–a house ordina-
rily empty enough—was met with sundry bow-wows and roo-ti-toos;
after which the spaniels resumed their two legs; and the puppets
became flesh.

THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRESS.
It is expected that the Moniteur will shortly contain the following:—
DECREE. -
Considering, 1–That all descriptions of leading articles but one,
contain reflections.
Considering, 2-That those reflections may be reflections on the
Government.
The PRINCE PRESIDENT of the French Republic Decrees:–

leading strings.
The Minister of the Bed Chamber and Boots is charged with the
execution of this decree. Louis NAPOLEoN.

AN EXETER SCOLLARD.
At the late Exeter Assizes, the following summons is stated to have
been handed up to the judge, MR. BARON MARTIN, by the special
juryman on whom it was served:
“I am to sumon an warn you to apeir at the Castle at Exon on Wednesday the
26 day of July instant comming by 8 o'clock in the morning to sarve on the spical
jury at the assize on the trile of HARDING and LADY Roll."
It is scarcely credible that an example of ignorance such as the
above should have been afforded by the diocese of Exeter, in which so
many educational institutions have been founded for the instruc-
tion of the people, such pains have been taken to inform and expand
their minds, and to impart to them a sufficiency of necessary learning
independently of all sectarian yiews; wherein, in short, such active and
gigantic efforts in the cause of §. enlightenment and for the diffu-
; of useful knowledge, have been made under the auspices of Bishop
HILPOTTS.
A Vehicle of Progress.
A CoAchMAKER is advertising as a great novelty an article he
calls a “silent and easy Brougham.”. This must, indeed, be something
new, and very different from the old original BRough AM, which can
never be silent for long together, and certainly can never be silent and
easy at the same moment. There seems to be something more like the
enuine article advertised under the title of a “Brougham with pole
or a pair,” inasmuch as our favourite BRough AM has indeed “pole
for a pair,” or head enough for two any day.

THE PEOPLE'S CRYSTAL PALACE.
THE 5th of August, 1852, will shine a day of light in the History of
England, For on that day the People's Crystal Palace-rolled away
like a silvery vapour from Hyde Park—will begin to take form, to
tower and expand in greater brightness and ſuller beauty in Penge
Park, Sydenham.
We are enabled to give a brief outline of the ceremony to be enacted
on the national occasion.
The QUEEN, will not be present; as HER MAJESTy reserves to
herself the right of opening the Palace for the People on May Day, 1853.
. Nevertheless, the ceremony, though simple, will be touchingly
unpressive.
IR Joseph Paxton will cut the first pane of crystal. And here
we are happy to record a most gracious act on, the part of a sympa:
thising Government. The Koh-i-Noor will be lent for the purpose of
º the crystal. Yes; the Koh-i-Noor will be allowed to quit its
bed of lead–(where it has of late been confined to undergo an operation
for the benefit of its beauty,)—and reposing on a black velvet cushion
covered with a glass dome, will be brought in custody of MR. Swift,
keeper of the Crown Jewels, mounted on an elephant magnificently
caparisoned for the occasion. -
At two o'clock, precisely-all preparations being made—the Koh-i-
Noor will be delivered into the right hand of SIR:Joseph Paxton,
who, bare-headed, will bow to it thrice, in acknowledgment of the
courtesy of HER MAJESTY. Then, SIR Joseph, tenderly, yet firml
holding the diamond between his two fingers and his thumb, will
approach a sheet of crystal duly propped for the occasion, and along a
yard rule, draw the diamond, cutting the first crystall
As the Koh-i-Noor runs along the glass, and the quick, musical ting
breaks from the cutting diamond, fifty silver trumpets will throw a
triumphant flourish to the winds. The people will F.course shout, and
—the first crystal will be cut!
SIR CHARLEs Fox will then step forward. An anvil wreathed with
flowers—(the roses of VENUs adorning the strength of Vulcan,)—
will be placed upon the ground. A hammer and a piece of iron will
then be, given to SIR CHARLEs, who, for a few seconds, will cere-

AN OWER TRUE TALE.
THERE's a snug little tap at the Royal Hotel,
That looks on the Southend pier;
And your “own correspondent” is Fºs to tell
Of a singular matter which lately befell,
As he sat in it drinking his beer:
For there came in a maid who a pitcher had got,
A maiden right comely to view;
('Twas a Saturday night when I sat in that spot)
And she said, “ #. Sir, Missis has sent for a pot
Of stout, and a family Pew.”
“What Dissenters are these ! ” in amazement I cried,
“Who hither have managed to creep?
In this diocese, surely, must PHILPotts preside
Since the pasture of souls from the inns is supplied,
And the tapsters look after the sheep.
“I have heard of free churches, indeed; but this new
Free and easy the whole of them beats.”
“Not so fast !” cried the waiter. “ ººff. us our due:
Our church, for we have one, is there in full view,
And we sell the tickets for seats.”
“By Dissenters,” I said, as I quitted º,
“If arrangements like this had been 6,
How soon would each zealous, True Blue British face
For the low, ranting, mad, Muggletonian race,
Its scorn and contempt have display'd
“That’twas sinful religion so far to profane,
From the pulpit we often should hear;
And be warn'd from the meetings of those to refrain, .
Who were willing their doctrine, poor things, to obtain

More careful should be, I opine;
Lest their union with inns rather closer should grow,

Should only be seen on a sign.”
After this, a tree—the first of the thousands of trees that are to

his will be done, and very properly, seeing what an Eden we are
romised in the garden of May next, by a female hand. Sir Joseph
F. will, of course, select the tree; and he will then have to select
as the planter of the tree, the most beautiful woman present; and we
heartily wish him—among such contending beauties-well out of his
difficulty. There is no doubt, however, that in his selection of the one,
he will please all. - -
The tree being planted, MR. Owen Jones will hang upon its branches
a garland of many-coloured flowers; illustrative of the lovely hues he
knows so well to select and harmonise. ...
This must be taken as the merest outline of the approaching cere-

aithful.
Dancing will, it is expected, be kept up until the nightingales begin;
and talking of nightingales, there is no doubt that the voice of the
Champagne will be heard in the land.
National Corm Plaster.
As LoRD DERby and his colleagues profess to be great corn-doctors
they ought to know where the shoe pinches, and to beware of the ill
effects of unequal pressure: it is therefore to be expected that they
will give us a specimen of their abilities by putting the Income Tax on
an equitable footing.
TRANSPORTING Thought !
THERE is a set of rascals who get their living by Fº swindlin
tricks upon poor emigrants. It is to be hoped that these fellows wi
be obliged to emigrate themselves—with this difference, that their
emigration shall be involuntary.

DIRECTLY it was known that the elections were going unfavourably

“What's this, SIR It's only Two Shillings.
ONE AND EightPENce l’”
Why, My Fars's
PUNCH*S POLICE COURT.
Last week Mr. Punch's Police Court was crowded to, excess. On
the Bench we observed several of the most distinguished Booksellers
and Publishers in London. The body of the Court was filled, prin-
º by the most respectable newsvendors and publication-sellers
of the metropolis.
The subject of this great excitement was one ANTONIO PANIzzi.
Mr. Punch. What are you, sir?
Prisoner. I am the librarian of the British Museum.
Mr. Punch. Well, sir, you are charged with neglecting to complete a
certain Catalogue of that Museum, and so doing grievous injury to the
interests of literature, besides bringing that national institution into
contempt in the estimation of all foreigners. Now, sir, answer me.
How many years have you been engaged on that Catalogue”
Prisoner (who spoke English remarkably well for a foreigner). I’m sure
I do not know; it may be ten, or fifteen, or twenty years—but really
I cannot tell. -
Mr. Punch. In fact, you have been engaged upon it so long that you
have lost all calculation as to the exact time? Is it not so?
Prisoner (with great coolness). Precisely. -
Mr. Punch. Now, sir, can you tell me in how many years this same
Catalogue will be completed? -
Prisoner. It is totally out of my power. It may be forty-it may be
sixty—it may be a hundred years. -
Mr. Punch. Do you expect this Catalogue, of which you have the
compiling, will ever be completed in your lifetime.”... . .
Prisoner (laughing). Oh, no; nor in my children's life-time either.
Mr. Punch. How far have you advanced in it - - - - - -
Prisoner. Really, you take me quite unawares. I think it is either
the letter D or E, or F, G, or H. In fact, I can say with certainty it
is one of them, but cannot say positively which,
Mr. Punch. Now, sir, what have you to say in your defence? You
have taken, on your own confession, “ten, or fifteen, or twenty years.”
upon merely the commencement of a Catalogue, which any respectable
auctioneer would have finished in as many weeks, if not days. What
have you to advance in justification of such shameful neglecº P.
Prisoner (boldly). I am engaged all the time upon other business!
Mr. Punch. What business could have been half so important as
the one you had sº in hand P
Prisoner. Why? was engaged in summoning booksellers and
newsvendors in failing to supply the British Museum with the books
and numbers of the periodicals they publish. -
Mr. Punch. But that cannot take up much of your time?
. Prisoner. Oh, yes! it does—it takes up the greatest part of my
time. Why / I was engaged all last week in summoning MR. CATNACH,
because he had not sent me in a copy of his recent Ballads; and it took
me another week to pull up MR. Pitts, for not having left, at our
office, his last edition of Mother Shipton's Prophecies. I couldn't find
him at his “Toy and Marble Warehouse,” in the Seven Dials.
Mr. Punch. So then, the Catalogue of the British Museum has to wait
for MR. CATNAch's Ballads, and Mother Shipton's Prophecies 2
Prisoner. Exactly It's perfectly clear 1 cannot be attending to two
things at once... I cannot be summoning these fellows and having them
. at the Police Office, and attending to the Catalogue at the same
line.
Mr. Punch. It's perſectly clear you cannot, and so I have come to
this resolution. As ; say very properly, “you cannot attend to two
things at once;” I fairly give you notice that the next time you are
brought up before me for neglecting your Catalogue, that I shall take
it away from you, and allow you to pursue the other part of your
business, for which you seem much better qualified; and I will take good
care that your successor is not an Italian.
This decision seemed to give general satisfaction to every one but the
prisoner, who, muttering, left the Court for Holywell Street, evidentl
on a hunting expedition for some unhappy publisher. We may cheris
the national hope, therefore, of the §. Catalogue being very
shortly taken out of MR. PANIzzi's hands.
TRIMMING FOR THE TIARA.
We believe we may state that an important change is about to be
made in the fashion of the º tiara. Most of our readers are aware
that an enlightened French priest, the ABBſ. GAUME, a short time
since, published a work of genius entitled the Per Rongeur, wherein he
denounced classical literature, so called, as anti-catholic. The appear-
ance of this, production occasioned a controversy among the French
clergy, which the Pope is said, on good authority, to have decided in
favour of the intelligent ABBf “The cause is finished; Rome has
spoken”—in a voice that sounds very much like a bray. Accordingly,
nobody will be surprised to see his HollNEss, come out with his triple
hat considerably elongated, having a peaked crown terminated by a
tassel, and a pair of long ears at the sides.
As it seems probable that the popish priesthood will prefer the latinity
of the schoolmen to that of Cicero and VIRGIL, it will perhaps be
necessary, that their denomination, to which the name of Latin Church
º º hitherto applied, should henceforth be styled the Dog Latin
urch.
Lodging-house Logic.
WE perceive by a police report, that the duty of enforcing the law
against the filthy lodging-houses in St. Giles's, has been entrusted to
Inspector REAson. We do not wonder at his having found his task
almost hopeless, for the inmates were sure to refuse to fis. to REAson,
when his voice opposed their own tºº interests. We are
delighted to see the authorities awake to the subject of these horrible
abodes, for the beds they contain are not matters to sleep upon.
soMethING LIKE A BALL!
A FAST young º who does not go to Almacks, alluding to
the new buildings at the Electric Telegraph Office in the Strand, says
“she envies, that Company, for they have a large Ball all the year
round, and they keep it up like One o'clock'."
The Spirit of the Till.
Colonel MUNDY tells us, in his book of the Antipodes, that “The
Spirit of the Till is rapidly infusing itself into the native, dealings and
character” at Australia. This is, in one sense, exactly...what is wanted
in a country where hands are scarce. This, spirit, will be driving the
natives to the Diggings, for if there is one field, which will yield more
to the Till than another, it must be a Gold Field.
The Distressed Bailiff's Home.
Owing to the great destitution amongst sheriffs' officers which has
been occasioned by recent law reforms, and will be increased by the
lamented decease of John DoE and Richard Roe, it is in contempla-
tion to establish an asylum for the benefit of that popular class of
persons, under the name of the Levi-athan.
AN ENGUIRY.
We wonder if MR. DisrAELI will bequeath to his successors, all
he sees “looming in the future?” and whether he will bequeath it as
an “air-loom?”

PEEL IN THE MARKET-PLACE.

|||||||||||||||||||
THE statue of SIR. Robert PEEL-the man of cheap bread; the man
whose memory is sweet and nourishing in the mouths of millions—
stands unwrapt in the market-place of Tamworth. At a good time
was the statue stripped from its coverings; and manifested to the broad
daylight. At an excellent and most significant time—at the very time
that the Minister DERBY-the man of the dear loaf, could he only send
it up—was still folding and swathing himself in politic wrappings: an
effigy of mystery—an indefinite thing looming in the haze of the
future session.
The market-place, of all places, is the site for the statue of PEEL.
His i. his energy, his self-sacrificing clear-sightedness, has made
the º market-place somewhat more pleasantly familiar to the
poor. They, with more food for their money, may cast a grateful,
thanksgiving look to the genius of the market-place—beneficent SIR
Robert—as they wend homeward to store the cupboard.
The ceremony of inaugurating the statue passed off very genially; but
the memory of SIR. Robert Peel demands some penitential offering at
the hands of the men who, abusing him to the death, now with brassy
cheek and ready tongue acknowledge the benefits of his policy. More-
over we are inclined to think so well of their repentance that, were the
manner of penance plainly indicated to them, we think they would
hardly hesitate to practise it.

man odorous as a bank of spring violets. Sothought CHARLEs.The FIFTH,
by no means the most sentimental of monarchs. For his Majesty, to
show his royal sense of the invention of the herring-curer, visited the
tomb of William BENKELs, and there, in regal state and with thanks-
giving stomach, did eat a herring—yes, did solemnly consume one of the
precious fish upon the grave of the first curer. It had been well for
mankind had kings always banquetted thus wisely. The broiled herring
eaten on a grave, and the º that, once upon a time, swam
adown each side of a Carlton-House table were fish significant of very
different reflections.
Well, what CHARLEs THE FIFTH did in gratitude, let LorºD DERby
and MR. Disraeli in some manner imitate in penitence. Let them
visit Tamworth market-place on market-day at noon, and at the foot of
SIR. Robert's statue, that shall “all the while run blood” of barley-
corn, let them bare-headed and upon their knees consume a humble-pie
made for the occasion; the pie of tariff rumpsteak, and the crust of
Free-trade flour. If the PREMIER and the CHANCELLoR will only
promise this, Mr. Punch will, in return, promise to be upon the ground
with a new ruby-pointed pen to chronicle the historical event.
We trust, at least, to MR. Disraeli, as a brother author—(authors
are all brothers; CAINs and ABELs')—for the courtesy of an early
notice.

CHAPTER XV.
ONE reads in the newspapers that, owing to the political intrigues of
PRINcess Rougewrinkle (who makes morning calls upon Continental
kings, with secret treaties in her golden card-case), one dynasty is not to
be “recognised,” and another is to go into a state of “fusion,” and a
third is to retract its “reclamation,” and, in fact, all sorts of wonderful
tricks are to be played upon nations with the cards that come out of
the Princess's card-case. And one hears, with even more surprise, that
if the wives of any of the next new Ministers should happen to be ladies
of Dissenting or Quaker persuasion, there will be another Church
revolution or two; DR. Watts's hymns will drive out BRADY and
TATE; and when DR. SUMNER asks after the health of DR. WILBER-
Force, he will be ordered by the Privy Council to use bad English, and
say, “How is thee, HENRY } "And yet some people assert that ladies
have no power in public matters. As for myself, I do believe that the
more I develope my own character on paper, the less worthy I prove
myself of anybody’s attention. All the ingredients prescribed for the
composition of a heroine slip away from under my pen one after
another. I have just discovered that I have no ambition. Had it been
otherwise, who knows but that one of these days I might have
revented a “fusion,” or insisted on my husband's abolishing all the
ishops? For I have had an offer of a “destiny of distinction,” or at least
an offer from a gentleman who has * convinced himself that he is
entitled to make such a proposal. Had I pleased, I might have been
the betrothed bride of the new Member of Parliament for the Muddle-
grub burghs. This gentleman has fully made up his mind that he is
one of the master-spirits of the age, and that his return for Muddle-
grub is by no means a result of an extraordinary outlay by his confiding
papa, but a special interference of Providence in favour of a helpless
nation. I understand that several gentlemen, holding similar views,
are anxiously waiting for the assembling of the new House, all regarding
themselves as Coming Men. But MR. Mukkie GLIMMER, I am
certain, conceives that he has come much more forward than any of his
competitors. I, shall watch the reports of the debates with great
interest, and look for MR. GLIMMER's speeches with a curiosity which
the wives of few Members, I am told, exhibit in regard to their
husbands' orations,
We had a dinner party, and for some reason or other-certainly not
with any view to what followed— º asked MR. GLIMMER. He came
late, but apologised by saying that he had been so engrossed by some Blue
Books that *...*. forgotten the flight of time. I thought I saw a slight
smile on the lips of two or three shrewd old City men whom the student
had kept waiting, but perhaps it was only from pleasure that they would
be kept no longer. At dinner, I was placed between one of these
gentlemen and the new Member of Parliament. He is a large, fresh-
coloured person, with rather an arrogant expression of countenance,
and a voice which he obviously labours to render as soft as he can, but
which becomes harsh and unpleasant when he loses his self-possession,
or grows angry. -
“You don't read the papers, I suppose,” he said, indulgently, in the
º of dinner; “it is not to be expected that a lady should take that
rouble.”
“O yes, I do, very often,” I said, adding, not quite civilly, “I like
them so much when Parliament is not sitting, and they have room for
reviews of books, and pleasant information.”
“Well, perhaps you are right,” said M.R. GLIMMER. “Indeed, I
wish the writers would keep to books, and operas, and things they can

understand. ... I assure you, as a public man, it is quite painful to see
how ignorantly they deal with more important topics. I make a point
myself of never reading a leading article.” -
“Better if he did, sometimes, perhaps,” muttered my other neighbour
to me, “and then he would not have told you that the EMPEROR or
AUSTRIA was a foolish old man, completely governed by his wife.”
He had said so, certainly, but I had set it down as one of those
mistakes which people make in conversation, and which gentlemen, who
make them in conversation with young ladies, often think not worth
correcting—“dare say the girl did not motice it, or knew no better if
she did.” But when I mentioned that a friend of ours was gone to
fish for salmon in Norway, I was rather surprised to hear the Member
of Parliament assert that the fisherman must have obtained a Russian
passport,
“Good again,” growled the City merchant, who knew every place
in the world, I believe. “And these are the people who cram for
foreign debates, and take upon themselves to speak up for commerce
and its interests. Ask him whether there will be a good supply of
humming-birds from Odessa this year.”
But this I would not venture, though I to think he would have
answered, vaguely, that the official accounts could hardly be
depended upon, or something of that kind. He favoured me, during
dinner, with an outline of the course he intends to take in Parliament.
I should misuse his technical words, but their effect was that he
intended to have our foreign policy entirely remodelled, and that no
despatch of any kind should ever be sent to anybody until the sense of
the House had been taken upon it. He should take his Atlas down to
the House—
“One step in the right direction,” murmured my neighbour.
“Another would be to begin to study it.” -
And he should say to the Foreign Secretary, “Now, either Sicily (for
example) is an island or it is not an island. If it is an island—”
“It is a piece of land surrounded by water,” said the City gentleman
aloud. “You won't impeach the poor Minister if he answers so, sir,
will you?” -
“Sir,” retorted MR. GLIMMER, “if our constituents treat such
matters lightly, it is for us to set them a better example.”
“Evaded my question, by JUPITER,” muttered the old gentleman to a
piece of preserved ginger. “Be hanged if I think he knows a niland
from a mismus.”
Just before the ladies retired, MR. GLIMMER got a more general
audience, and declared, very frankly, that if helived through the session,
we should see some new leaves turned over in the Government book.
He had pledged himself to reduce the national expenses one-half, to
regulate the taxation so that nobody would feel it, even if it were
doubled, and to compress the whole of the laws into a code which
should not be larger than the Handbook of Etiquette. These were
trifles, some of which he was aware had been already promised by
several candidates, including members of the Government, but these
were only stepping stones to what he meant to effect. He should throw
the National Debt upon the East India Company's shoulders, confiscate
the Railways to the use of the nation, sell all the Colonies by auction,
and enact that every child, born after next New Year's Day, should be
sent out as an emigrant as soon as it could walk. But this last pro-
position caused rather a sensation among the ladies, and before
MR. GLIMMER could defend his views, AUNT RATCHET got us away—
my City neighbour growling (as he handed me a handkerchief I had
dropped):
“. By George—I trust the Bottle-holder will have one chance—just one
—of illuminating your friend.”
. The great statesman had been a bottle-holder himself before he
joined us, and when he came "' his political ardour had been a little
drowned in some wonderful Madeira of papa’s, which “went out” in
1816–the year, MR. MURKIE GLIMMER insisted, of the battle of
Waterloo. I hardly know whether anything that might have been said
down-stairs about me had opened his light-coloured eyes to my merits,
or whether, as is more likely, papa had talked so cleverly that MR.
GLIMMER had been charmed with the idea of a connexion with some-
body who could give him, so many new ideas. At any rate, he was
“marked in his attentions,” as the books say, and after several calls,
none of which found us at home, he sent a formal declaration of his
sentiments, as regarded myself.
Now, if...MR. GLIMMER, should not be unseated on petition—papa
says he will—and make a brilliant figure in the House of Commons.
If, while the eyes of the nation are watching him with eagerness, a
most important debate should come on, and while parties, balanced to a
nicety, are wild with excitement, a splendid speech from MR. GLIMMER
should turn the scale. If Ministers should resign, and their successors
should instantly secure MR. GLIMMER as one of their Secretaries of
State. If, after a brief period, during which the duties of his office
should be discharged, more superbly than was conceivable, the Queen
and the country should unite in calling upon MR., or, more pleasantly,
the MARQUIs GLIMMER, to take the whole destinies of the country into
his hands, and he should kiss those of his sovereign on his becoming
Premier of England. If LoRD GLIMMER, having for years made his
own country happy and prosperous, and defied or conciliated all the
other kingdoms of the world, should be created DUKE of GLIMMER,
with a pension of half a million for himself and his heirs for ever—if
all these things should happen, MR. GLIMMER will not be surprised,
for he is not of a nature to be surprised at any º of his own
marvellous merits. Indeed, something of this kind is the future to
which he considers he has a right to look. But though he may not be
surprised, I know who will—and that is the young lady whose papa, at
her request, declined her chance of becoming Duchess of GLIMMER,
º dynasties, and compelling bishops to speak Quakerly

RELIGIOUS PUFFING.
EITHER the science of puffing has risen very high, or the ministers of
religion are stooping very low, when we find people invited to places
of worship by such advertisements as we might expect to see employed
in an attempt to “pull 'em in”—as the minor theatrical phrase runs—
to the Grecian Saloon or the Wictoria. The following advertisement
emanates, it is true, from a Roman Catholic concern; but we are sorry
to say that this practice of religious puffing is confined to no particular
denomination, and pervades Exeter Hall as much as it does the humble
meeting-house where a pious tea and muffins form the inducement held
out to the visitors to join the local faithful at some popular bathing-place.
We must, however, admit that we have seen nothing that comes
nearer to the Mosaic order of puffing than the following, which
appeared one day last month in the Times supplement :
O THE CATHOLICS OF LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS.–Have
you seen the truly beautiful new church, dedicated to our “Lady Star of the Sea,”
on Croom's Hill, opposite the west side of Greenwich Park? If you have not, you
should pay it a devotional visit. Next Sunday, there will be a special source of
attraction, as the Rev. H. E. MANNING, M.A., late Archdeacon of Chichester,
PREACHES in the morning, on behalf of the Poor Schools. High mass at 11.
Vespers at 6. The indefatigable priest having, after many years of extreme toil,
succeeded in erecting a glorious temple, is now anxious to extend the educational
arrangements for the poor children. The good and generous must and will help him.
Pray cheer his pastoral labours. Address your communications to the Very Rev.
Canon North, Croom's Hill, Greenwich ; or, if you wish it, go by the railway from the
London Bridge Station, or by the omnibuses from Charing 8. Elephant and Castle,
and Gracechurch Street, or by the steamers from the various bridges or Blackwall
Pier.
The puff interrogatory has long been a favourite with professors of
the art, and “Have you seen the new church P” may rank, henceforth,
in the literature of uffery among the well-known questions, “Can you
speak French ** "What shall I do with my money?” and other clap;
trap queries, with which the public eye is familiar. The “special
attraction” for next Sunday may be classed with the popular fictions
of the “million additional lamps at Vauxhall,” and the “extra talent”
at a theatre which is trying to struggle on with half a company.
The appeal to the “good and generous” is only a slight variety ol
the formula which is so continually addressed to the eye of “the
Benevolent” by some anonymous widow, often to be found in male
attire over a pot and a pipe—who is “plunged in distress,” and who
makes a desperate plunge, by means of a five shilling advertisement, into
that favourite plunge-bath—the pocket of the kind-hearted portion of
the community. The announcement of a combined attraction, con-
sisting of High Mass at ll, and Vespers at 6, is strongly suggestive
of the tea-dealer's invitation to “try our Black at 4s,” or “our §. at
5s.; ” and the notification that “the good and generous must help him,”
reminds us of the various uses of the word “must :” among which the
piteous cry of “must have cash,” and the sinister hint of “must be
cleared off,” are most frequently met with, “Pray cheer his pastoral
labours,” is in the nature of a reminder similar to that of “Don’t forget
the nobby shop; ” and the wind-up, which sets forth the places of
starting by boat, omnibus, or rail, for “the truly beautiful new church,
dedicated to our Lady Star of the Sea,” savours strongly of the para-
graph in the bills of Cremorne, wherein the easy accessibility of that
popular place of entertainment is insisted on.
e are quite sure that all the honest friends of true religion, with-
out reference to the denomination to which they belong, will thank us
for our exposure of this disgusting specimen of religious puffing—a
practice which can only bring scandal, upon the cause it pretends to
romote and give a handle to those who seek to turn serious matters
into ridicule,
Coming to a Bad End.
A “Young Monkey,” whose name and address will be printed if he
dares to write to us again, has had the audacity to ask us whether the
Finis, whose signature appears at the end of so many books, is the
worthy alderman of the City of London,

Monsieur communiqué.
T the present moment he is
a great writer in France: we
may say he is the greatest
writer, . it:
paper appears without some-
F. signed by Mons.
CoMMUNIQUE. He is the
only person who is not ex-
pected to sign his contribu-
tions—for CoMMUNIQUE is
not his real name. What
his real name is, we cannot
say. It is only known that
he is the nephew of his
uncle, and that he wears
moustaches. His style is
sharp and tranchant, like a
sword. There is a military
perfume about his writing,
as if it had been dried with
fº. instead of sand,
is meaning is as pointed
as a bayonet. The conse-
quence is, no editor dares
refuse his copy. If Com-
MUNIQUE is paid for all he
writes, by this time he must
be one of the richest men
on the French press. And
justly so: no one is so well
informed as Mons. Commu-
NIQUE. He knows every-
thing long before it is going to happen. Rumour, who knows no mall quantity
of things in England, is a stupid, ...,n. person by the side of CoMMUNIQUE.
And where does he get all his information from ? Persons say it is, from living so
close to the Elysée. The walls of that Elysian building, it seems, like all others,
have ears; and it is whispered that CoMMUNIQUE has got hold of two of them. Be
it as it may, all he says is authentic. Imaginative or not, let it be as true as a
gentleman's word or as false as a President's oath, directly it is printed it is
received as history, and read with the same gulping faith. Not a soul dares con-
tradict it. Not a pen has the temerity to raise a doubt against it. For this
reason CoMMUNIQUE is a very safe writer. No writer on the French Press is half
30 safe, excepting those who are out of the kingdom. CoMMUNIQUE has never
received a single warning from the Government. No journal is likely ever to be
suppressed for inserting his contributions. . His favorite organ is the Moniteur,
and its lively pages have greatly benefited by his communications. His articles
have a pithy dryness about them, which, directly you see the signature, make you
laugh. You know at once the wag who has written them. The tone of mock
authority he puts on is very amusing. He fancies he is not known—and yet every
one sees the big moustaches bristling behind the transparent mask. The Imperial,
too, peeps through every line.
We will give a few specimens of this celebrated author's style:-
“It is publicly reported that all the horses in the PREsident's stables are English horses, and not
French. As this is a libel on the man who was the elect of upwards of five millions of voices, we
hasten on the best authority to state that there is nothing English in the stables of the Elysée,
not even a groom—no, not even a pot of blacking. The PREsident knows the French nation too well
to think of mounting to power by any other ineans than French means, upon any other horses than
French horses. “CoMMUNIQUE."
“It is confidently rumoured that the PRINCE Louis NApoleon has paid all his debts. The object
of these rumours is too evident; but luckily they contradict themselves. “CoMMUNIQUf.”
“We are anthorised to state that the PRINCE Pnesident has not proposed to MADEMoiselle
Cinque Olympique, the eldest daughter of the MAREchAL FRANconi, who won his spurs in the most
distinguished military circle of the Empire. We have reason to know that this method of marrying
the Prince without his consent, is extremely unpleasant to him—more especially as he has no
intention of getting married, until such period as he has got rid of his dreadful cold. This answer
must suffice for the 2,197 duchesses, actresses, and vivandières, to whom our respected Prince has
been privately married within the last fortnight. “Communique.”
“Once for all, the PREsident does not keep a Boule-dogue, nor is there one about his premises.
Qur noble Paksident has no greater ambition than to see his throne surrounded by nothing but
French dogs. “CoMMUNIQUg.”
... We hope some day to see all the contributions of Mons. CoMMUNIQU£ collected
in one thick volume, with a Biography, (how we should like to write it!) and an
authentic Portrait. The Portrait º then reveal the mighty secret who Mons.
CoMMUNIQUE was. We wonder who it can be? One thing is very certain—
it cannot be Louis NAPOLEoN
A Joke ALL Hot.—We have been asked what race the º individual
belongs to who is enveloped during the intense heat in a full suit of leopard skins,
As far as we can judge by the look of the poor fellow in a broiling sun, we should
say he is a Hot-an-hot.

A WOLUNTEER FOR THE SHRIEWALTY.
OH, I will the Sheriff of London be;
Let others pay the fine:
For I shall rejoice in the dignity
In the Guildhall when I dine;
And with buckles and sword at my LoRD MAYOR's
oard,
More bright than a beadle shine.
My heart will swell like a huge balloon—
Will bound at a glorious rate—
Whilst, blazing as the sun at noon,
I ride in my coach of state;
Blue, crimson, and gold, so grand to behold,
With my consequence elate.
And then to strut at Court in bag,
In ruffles, and in tights;
And evermore have through life to brag,
That with dukes, and lords, and knights,
With my lips I kiss'd the Royal fist—
Oh, bravest of delights'
For Sheriff of London, then, I'm your man,
I love the pomp and show;
And stand the expense I also can,
But others cannot do so:
Unable to pay, not fond of display,
Contemptible snobs, and low.
THE PRECIOUS MEMBER FOR MEATH.
An Irishman signing himself RICHARD J. KELsh, C. C.,
has published a political epistle, wherein he avers that
“Meath, in her priesthood, sat in calm council, and selected as her
ºuve one of the purest, best, and most gifted of this earth's
Who is this great, good, and holy man; this extremely
talented and immaculate individual; this ornament of his
species; who is this fellow—not foul-mouthed, abusive,
vituperative, slanderous, mendacious fellow – but this
fellºw of Airãºn the GREAT and SHAKSPEARE, and, as
MR. Kelsh must think, of St. PATRick himself?
This particularly fine fellow is MR. FREDERICK LUCAs,
editor of the Tablet.
MR. Lucas, it seems, is a representative of representa-
tives. The priesthood represent Meath, and MR. LUCAs
represents the priesthood. Note this: because it shows
that the charitable sentiments, the veracious assertions,
and gentle remonstrances of the Tablet may now be con-
sidered to represent the charity, veracity, and meekness
of the Meath priesthood.
Amiable and excellent-may, most excellent, most
amiable MR. Lucas, superlative son of the earth, has
been returned for Meath by Meath's priesthood, sitting
in calm council—calm, doubtless, as ADDIson's hero–
. he was riding in the whirlwind and directing the
Suorm.
MR. Lucas, famous for gentlemanly language and
veracity, will go to Parliament, the delegate of the Meath
priesthood; their mouth-piece, to talk pearls and diamonds,
of course, like the nice child in the nursery tale, and not
spiders, adders, and toads, like the other. Or, would
if not be better to say, he will be sent there as their
political fire-engine, to play holy water on the flames of
religious discord? – water really... holy, pure, sanctified
:f pf hydrogen, with no proportion of mud in it "at all
at all.'
Marvel of purity, ſº and genius, Lucas, the
papal phenomenon, will go to the House of Čommons, and
there, it is to be hoped, talk himself and his priesthood
into that notice, credit, and attention which they deserve
—unless, he shall prefer to change his tone, and, after the
approved fashion of members for Irish Rome, die on the
floor of the House, and then go back to Meath, and get
returned afresh to die over again.
In due time, anyhow, it may be expected that MR. LUCAs,
by dint of talking purity, goodness, and, wisdom, in the
Tablet style, will talk himself into the Premiership, and
then, like a true Ultramontane, forming an ecclesiastical
cabinet, he will of course make his priestly eulogist,
KElsh, CHANCELLOR OF THE Exquakeb.

YoUR Vote is Most Respectfully Solicited For GoRMAN O'SMothesem, The RALE FRIEND
To LIBERTY AND THE Pope.
THE GREAT WAITER
QUESTION.
We have lately touched a cord that
seems to have acted like the wire of
an electric telegraph upon all the bells
in all the hotels and coffee-houses in
the kingdom, whose waiters are
answering us in such numbers, that
we are puzzled how to answer all the
waiters that have appealed to us. We
have no desire to put down the waiter,
but are anxious to put him up and
elevate him in the social scale, by
taking him out of the position of a
mendicant seeking, to be “remem-
bered” as an act of charity, and placing
him among those who have a fair and
recognised value placed upon their
services.
Instead of leaving his casual remu-
neration to the indefinite estimate of
“What you please,” we would have
him receive, without favour on one
side or beggary on the other, that
which he is entitled to. We want to
see a proper distribution of the waiters'
charges over the public in general,
instead of the sum being levied
largely upon the liberal few, and col-
lected scantily from the mean or
economical many. An equalisation
of the burdens on travellers is as
much required as an equalisation of
the burdens on land, and if one is a

On his wicked will depends;

He exclaims “Your soul—or vote.”

“THE ENGLISH DON'T KNOW HOW TO AMUSE
THEMSELVES.”
THE English know how to love, and hate, and drink, and fight; and
they know well enough how to amass money, and make constitutions
which are the envy and admiration of the world—but “they do not
know how to amuse themselves.”
So said MR. LAING, on Thursday last, at Penge Park, and we must
say we do not agree with him.
Why, look how the French have been amusing themselves lately!
Haven’t they been blessing les, and giving Fêtes, where the walls
of the ball-rooms (cannon-ball-rooms rather) were hung, with the
..., drapery of war-drapery invariably lined with the deepest

That, is the way the French amuse themselves. They collect a
hundred thousand soldiers and as many priests as they can together,
and the amusements consist alternately of cannonading and psalm-
singing. It is º: at soldiers—a very pretty, but expensive game—
of which the people have always to pay the expenses that princes may

the sheep in LANDSEER's #. merely out of sheepish curiosity, to
see what there is inside. He cares nothing for “Feasts of Eagles:” in
fact, he would much sooner dine at any other table than feast with such
carnivorous companions.
In humiliating truth, our amusements have not the same melo-
dramatic effect as those of the French. . They would not, probably, look
so well upon the stage. They certainly do not come out so grandly

desire to see waiters well paid, and
indeed, we would have them rovided

them made the “especial charge” of
their employers. We intend for the
future, and we urge the same course
upon all our readers, to throw out any
bill that is laid on our table which does
not include a fixed charge for service;
and if all bills are rejected until such
amendment is made, we have no doubt
that the attempt to bring in such
bills will be abolished everywhere, as
it is already in all the best establish-
ments.

nonsense as you are,
when transferred to the historical pages of the Illustrated News. ...We
have not the fierce hussars, or the Abbés, or mounted Arabs, or those
magnificent Archevêques, or the same bearded and moustachioed back-
ground, with fireworks behind to throw them forward. We confess, our
national amusements do not make such beautiful pictures, but we flatter
ourselves that the letterpress, whose duty it is to explain the pictures,
is of a much higher order of literature. The question is, which
description will read the best in a few years' time?
For instance, look to the amusements of last Thursday at Sydenham.
They were as simple as possible, and with nothing military about them,
excepting a band or two of music. They consisted merely of fixing a
column in the earth, and of hanging, like garlands round a May-pole, a
few flowery speeches round it. There was not a soldier present—there
might have been a policeman, only we did not see him—and there were
only one or two cannons, and they would have been much better out of
the way. Everything was as quiet, as orderly, as at a christening;
and, in fact, it was a christening of the old Crystal Palace, *:::
this occasion, was re-christened “THE PAIACE of THE PEOPLE.” We
live in the strongest hope that the child will be in every way an honour
to its parent. -
The great cause of Peace had every fitting honour paid to it on
Thursday last at Sydenham. In its train followed some of the greatest
celebrities of the day, all children of the *f; who had come to assist
at the christening of their new Palace. The Arts and Sciences, of
course, were there, and gave the cause their blessing, until such time
when they could give it something, if not more pure, at least more
tangible. Literature, too, was there, and promised to devote its best
pen to the service of the new principle, and Trade and Commerce had
already sent off their ships to collect treasures to pour into the lap of
their beautiful, but too long neglected child, as soon as its Palace was
in a fit state to receive them. And the Poor advanced. and, openins

# would be like blaming a man who had been imprisoned all his life,
because he couldn't dance. But we, think, we have said enough to
prove, that oncertain grand occasions the Englishman does know how to
amuse himself, perhaps not so pictorially, but at all events as rationall
as a Frenchman, or any other countryman. In the meantime we wis
him every enjoyment in his new play-ground at Sydenham. It will be

With splendid paintings on their walls,
And elegantly ſurnished.

But not a Palace e'er came near

For Punch, of course, a stander-by,
Saw its first prop erected:
And music's swell and cannon's bang,
With cheers and plaudits mixing,
Proclaimed the act of MR, LAING,
His hand that pillar fixing.
The sky upon the work begun
Smiled bright and clear and pleasant,
But brighter eyes put out the sun,
So many ladies present;
The music, sunshine, beauty, lunch,-
For lunch ensued—did capture

And put him in a rapture.

MORE CURIOSITIES OF ADVERTISING
LITERATURE.
º HEN MR. DISRAELI, quit-

of the Times and its Sup-
s plements. The two follow-
ing advertisements, ap-
ing on the same day
in the same paper, an
# referring to the same
address, savour so much
of “the same concern,”
that we cannot help at-
tributing them to the same individual. We therefore print them
together.
O GOVERNESSES.—A LADY is REQUIRED, in the midland counties,
to educate three little girls. She would be treated in every other respect as one
of the family. No salary will be given. Apply by letter only at Mrs. W.'s, G. K
RIVATE EDUCATION.—A lady, keeping a governess and educating her
litte girl at home, is desirous of RECEIVING TWO YOUNG LADIES, upon
| moderate terms, who would be treated in every other respect as her own. Apply by
letter only at Mrs. W.'s, G. K.
These announcements bespeak a “dodge” of the most despicable
kind, and lead to the conclusion, that the “lady” wishes to humbu
a governess on the one hand to educate three children for nothing, an
to humbug some parent on the other hand into paying for the sup:
posed advantage of a salaried governess. The advertiser, in P." of
fact, desires to turn her house into a boarding school, and to get
assistants without paying them. In one advertisement, she says, “no
salary will be given,” but is far from saying “no salary will be re-
ceived.” She modestly suggests that for farming out to others, the
brains she expects to suck gratuitously, her own “terms” will be
“moderate.” - - -
We should like to see a few more advertisements of this kind, for
the reductio ad absurdum involved in the monstrous proposition to pay
a governess nothing at all, and get a clear profit on her by letting out
her services to somebody else, must form a strong argument against
the whole of the iniquitous system. . It is evident that governesses
have reached the minimum point of price, and it is a symptom of their
being on the turn, or beginning to look up, when a speculator is found
| tices. We saw an instance, the other day, in the shape of an
dabbling in the article with a view to making a profit out of it. ..
If it is beginning to be worth the while of a lady” to advertise a
“governess kept,” as a bait to the parents of "little girls wanting a
home,”—they must want one very much indeed before they are turned
over to the tender mercies of such a “lady”—it is time to consider
whether the governess had not better take her abilities directly into the
market, without the intervention of the middle-woman being assented to.
While we are on the subject of the Curiosities of Advertising Litera-
ture, we may as well refer to our friend the Lancet, which sometimes
comes out rather strongly in this way on the subject of medical prac-
Wer-
tisement of a surgical connection, the chief recommendatipn to which
was its being “on a line of railway to all parts of the kingdom.”. Such
an opening on the Eastern Counties two or three years †: would have
made the fortune of any young practitioner, who was able to put this
and that together, when called in to collect and combine the disjecta
membra of unfortunate passengers.
Perhaps the “funniest” advertisement that has met our eye for some
time is the following; and as we like to finish with something pleasant,
we will wind up with it. Here it is:-
Ux ETRANGERES.—A LADY wishes to find in the middle of Sep-
tember, a young German girl of from 12 to 14, to speak and read German with
her. She must speak good French and German. She would be under the care of the
lady's maid, and take her meals with the servants. As she would not be required to
do anything else, only a present would be made her on leaving. Address, &c., &c.
A lady expecting to find a young German girl in the middle of Sep-
tember is something like .# needle in a bottle of bay; and
there is an air of wild impossibility about the whole thing that borders
on the humorous. The duties required are very vague, consisting of
nothing but to speak, German with the lady when she happens to be
In a un for a little guttural gibberishi for her own German is
of course anything but satisfactory. . ." As she will be required
to do nothing else” her work will be all talk, and we are not surprised
that there is to be no salary. She is to be “under the care of the lady’s
maid,” and brought out, of course, for the lady's amusement when her
own language becomes a bore, and she requires the excitement of some-
thing not quite so commonplace and comprehensible.
We can pardon this advertisement on the score of its eccentricity,
and we hope the “lady” will have a successful search into the very
heart of September, where she expects to find the “small German,”
that is to dispel her ennui by talking to her in a foreign language.

Evasion of Robbery.
In an article urging the fair and reasonable adjustment of the con-
fiscation called lncome Tax, the Times remarks, “At present the
State and the fraudulent contributor are much on a level.” The Times
is too charitable to the State. The State is the housebreaker who
wants to know where all the money is. The fraudulent contributor is
the housekeeper who misinforms the thief.
A GOOD RIDDANCE.
THE emigration of the Irish is called an Exodus. We wish, its
resemblance to that celebrated egress could be completed by their
sacerdotal rulers heading the expedition.
Expensive Favours.
THE Derbyites, we are told, spent many thousand pounds for favours
to be worn by their partisans, during the elections. They have paid
very dearly for them, we are afraid, for it is very clear that their
favours have not met with many returns.

PROTECTION AGAINST THE ELECTRIC
TELEGRAPH.
IMPORTANT MEETING OF THE SWELL MOB.
ERTAIN gentlemen, practising
as conveyancers in a pecu-
liar line at races, public
meetings, reviews, exhibi-
tions, sights, and theatres,
or otherwise interested in
the irregular and clandestine
transfer of property, many
of whom were attired in the
extreme style of fashion,
assembled yesterday evening
in a private room of the Old
Shop, to consider what steps
to take in consequence of
the arrangements now in
course of being made to
connect all the Police Offices
with the Electric Telegraph.
The * host, MR.
IKEY SLoMANs, who occupied the chair, said he felt himself much
nonoured by the werry respectable y as had come forrads in
defence of their common interests on that occasion, and begged to
express his sympathy with them as a landlord. (Hear, hear.)
Montgomery MoRTIMER said, that they had a new and terrible
foe to contend with. To the Beak—to the Claw of the Lobster—the
Law had now added the Lightning. (Oh /) They were to be nabbed
through electricity; they were to be collared by the agency of mag-
netism. Science had enlisted the Levin Brand as a Crusher. (Shame',
In the exercise of the arduous profession in which they (himself, and
his friends now present) were engaged, the climate of this country often
became too warm for their health. (Hear.) A brief retirement to
Boulogne, or tour on the Continent—perhaps a trip to America—was
then necessary. The connexion of the Police Offices with the Electric
Telegraph would operate as a most injurious check upon that temporary
emigration which was an essential refuge to gentlemen who followed an
avocation so extremely trying. (Hear, hear.)
MR. Bob Smithers, alias Jones, understood the gen’lm'n as had
just, spoke, to mean, that this here 'Lectric Telegraph bismis would
hinder hisself and his pals from cuttin' and runnin', by makin' of 'em
safe to be lagged. -
MR. MoRTIMER said the drift of his observations had been correctly
*:::::: by his honourable friend.
R. Bob, SMITHERs continued. There was no chance for a cºve
now. The detectives was bad enough; but this here scientific dodge
would be a reglar flabbergaster. (Hear) Your mechanical inventions was
spifflicatin’ manival dexterity. (Hear.) They had long hindered a
º feller from turnin’ an honest penny (Oh!); and now they wouldn't
et him turn a penny nohow. (Hear, hear.) He agreed with them
werry respeckble old gen’lm'n as held that machinery and all that sort
o' thing was the cusso’ the country. (Cheers.)
The REveREND MR. CAvendish BELGRAve, from his observation of
fashionable society, and especially from what he had heard at genteel
places of worship (Ironical Cheers)—he might, perhaps, be better
understood if he said swell churches—(Laughter)—was happy in being
enabled to state, for the comfort of the assembly, that there was a
clerical party—not a party in an individual sense, but a party of clerical
gents-in fact, of parsons—highly influential in the Legislature, who
were all for going back to the Middle Ages—the good old times—when
no Electric Telegraphs, or Police Offices either, existed to restrict
*: and limit enterprise. (Loud Cheers.)
Ma. BILL Snigg, surnamed The Downy, asked, vos there no ope in
a appeal to Guy’ment? In connection with Ministers he had heerd
mention ...of Thimblerig. (Hear.), Was there no sitch a thing, as
feller feelin'? Wasn't there no sort of honour, accordin’ to the sayin',
among certain persons? Wouldn't the Protectionists old out to 'em
no elpin’ and, that and as they had often met in the pocket o' the
people. (Hear, hear.) They might at all events try it on: and he
º: that a petition should be sent to the EARL of DERBY, prayin'
or Protection agin competition with the 'Lectric Telegraph on be-arf
of that important branch of British industry—
MR. Bei,GRAve.—Of which, in point of fact, we are the Chevaliers.
The honourable gentleman added that he should have much pleasure in
seconding MR. SNIgg's suggestion; but, he was afraid the hope of
ſº in the Ministerial quarter was the dream of a too confiding
mind. The Cabinet would never legislate against electric wires, unless
those wires were used to catch hares. (Hear.) All the Government
could do for them, he had reason to apprehend, would be to substitute
for that temporary emigration alluded to by MR. MoRTIMER, an emigra-
tion that would afford them an asylum more or less permanent, (Oh!)
but also more or less disagreeable (Ah!) and inconvenient (Hisses): a
sort of emigration, in short, of which the only advantage was that of
being gratuitous. (Loud groans.)
MR. Chizzell, said he feared they must trust to their personal
resources. For his own part, if science was sharp, he hoped to prove
sharper. (Hear.) . In the meantime, he would propose “Down with the
Electric Telegraph 1” (Cheers.)
The toast having been drunk with acclamation, three groans were
given for PROFEssoR, WHEATSTONE; and the time of opening the
theatres approaching, the assembly dispersed itself.
ONE OF OUR WOODEN WALLS.
(To the Admiralty.)
HER boilers unsafe—overloaded with coals—
About the Atlantic the poor Harpy rolls:
Used up all her fuel, the vessel they strip,
And burn every rag, stick, and chip in the ship;
Scarce able to steam, quite unable to sail,
She fares like a loose buoy afloat in the gale;
She tumbles and wanders amid the sea-foam
A hundred and ten days—at last she gets home,
Her crew nearly starved—out of water and grub—
And don't you call this a true Tale of a Tub?
ZOOLOGICAL RECREATIONS.
- MR. BRODERIP has writ-
ten a very amusing
book on the subject of
Zoological Recrea-
tions, but he has left
out a few of the most
popular recreations in
zoology, which are
ki:own to and indulged
in by the inhabitants
of the Metropolis. A
recent visit to the Sur-
rey Zoological Gardens
has introduced us to se-
veral recreations which
seem to be the most
popular with the fre-
quenters, and which
MR. BRODERIP takes
no notice of.
1. There is the zoo-
logical recreation of
riding on the elephant's
back for twopence.
2. There is the zoo-
a logical recreation of
throwing bits of stale
bun to the bear.
3. There is the zoo-
logical recreation—po-
pular *s the ladies—of poking at the monkeys with the points of
parasols. -
4. There is the zoological recreation of pelting the ducks at night-
fall, when the police are in the dark, in consequence of the forges of
the Cyclops being not yet lighted. - - -
5. #. is the zoological recreation of seeing the Carnivora dine at
five, and the more fashionable pelicans at half-past, in consequence of
there being two sets of animals to feed, like two dinners to be got in
one lodging-house. - -
6, and last. There is the zoological recreation of making a donkey of
one's self, a recreation which is much indulged in by certain persons at
all places of public amusement.

The Queen of the Sea.
THE Royal yacht was somewhat unceremoniously treated by FATHER
NEPTUNE last week, and the attempts of some of the lords and ladiºs
in ordinary to stand upon, Court etiquette were cut short by their
inability to stand upon anything. The functionary most in request was
the Lord Steward, who had exchanged his wand of office for an ordinary
basin. HER MAJEsty happily has no occasion for the services of this
great officer at sea, and the High Steward was therefore free to attend
upon himself, or upon any other portion of the suite to whom he might
be disposed to extend his good offices.

FISH.—CAUTION |
that sits up aloft to keep
watch for the welfare of
John BULL, has for
some time past been
continually sweeping the
horizon with his telescope
to see if he can make
out the possibility loom-
ing in the distance, that
the agriculturists were
told to look out for by
MR. DisRAELI. It is the
cherub's strong suspicion
that he now discerns the
possibility alluded to, in
a shape very much re-
sembling a kettle—which
he conjectures to be that
pretty kettle of fish likely
to accrue to the nation
in consequence of the
abrupt and unseasonable
mission on the part of
the Government of a
warlike squadron against
the American fishermen.
The elevated cherub con-
siders that America is
one of the chief sources
of our º: of bread-
stuffs; and that since the possibility of famine by means of a Corn Law
looms in the past, the only possibility of , ditto that can loom in
the future, is contingent on a quarrel with our corn-merchant—in
other words, with our bread-and-butter; in which quarrel, the cherub
in the high position hopes the people of England will not back the
Protectionists.
A PLEASANT WAY HOME.
(From our own Correspondent)
WHEN you requested me to act as your own correspondent during
my fortnight's tour in North Wales, you could not have been aware of
the utter impossibility of my writing you any letters, under the excite-
ment of new scenes, the inconveniences of travelling, and the remoteness
from all ordinary means of communication of the district in question. I
assure you I have not seen a Times during the whole fortnight less than
two days old. The staleness of the news, in fact, in these pastoral
regions, can only be equalled by the freshness of the eggs. I therefore
conceived that I, should best act up to the spirit of my instructions by
not writing at all. I should have carried out this intention fully, but
the circumstances under which I have returned to London appear to
me to deserve mention. I write, therefore, from my residence at
Paddington, and shall be obliged by your remitting in return my
fortnight's salary.
I do not know, sir, if you know North Wales, but if not, as is pro-
bable, I have to inform you, that near Llanrwst (you will please put in
the vowels ad libitum), is a romantic village called Be Hws-y-Coëd,
(you will please to repeat the process with the vowels,) which is a head-
quarters of artists during the summer and autumn. MR. DAVID Cox
has frequented the place for half a century, and MR. CREswick's
umbrella is a conspicuous landmark in most years. Among many other
charming pictures of the latter artist, you may remember one, exhibited
some three or four years ago, called “A Pleasant Way Home.”
That picture, sir, represents a landscape near Be Hws-y-Coëd. The
same locality has furnished me too with a picture on the same subject,
which I propose to present to you in this letter. By my “pleasant
way home” I mean the route from the said Be Hws-y-Coëd to
London.
If you had seen my fruitless efforts, on several mornings during my
stay, to discover by means of Bradshaw the route back to town, you
would have pitied me, in common with all travellers in these romantic
;egions. I knew the way to the Llangollen Road Station. This was
y coach: for there are still four-horse coaches in this primitive
quarter of the island; but here all distinct conception of progress
ended, and the struggle with Bradshaw began.
I despair of describing the manner in which I floundered through the
mazes of that periodical ; the wild way in which I plunged from
Llangollen Road (p 64) to Shrewsbury (pp. 43 to 47, 64, 67), thence |half
ło Wolverhampton (pp. 42 to 47, 60 to 65), and to Stafford (pp. 42 to
47,60 to 63), not to speak of mad divarications to Chester (pp. 42 to 47,
THE sweet little cherubli
49, 50, 60 to 63). Iſound myself sometimes brought up in a cul-de-sac at
some remote place, entirely unknown to the civilised world; or more
frequently, after a tangled navigation of many hundred miles, succeeded
in finding my way back to my starting point, at the Llangollen Road;
In short, after a series of mental efforts, which left me in a painful
state of incipient, imbecility, I flung Bradshaw on one side, and in a
rash hour determined to commit myself to the information of the rail:
way officials, and started, in that resigned frame of mind which, I
fancy, characterises the Arctic navigator.
I arrived at the Llangollen Road Station at seven o’clock, and was
assured I could reach town viá Wolverhampton and Birmingham the
same night, or rather, next morning, at 4 of 5 o'clock. I felt grateful
to the station-master, and started... I pass briefly over the incidents of
my journey to Wolverhampton vid Shrewsbury. Anxious to study the
native manners, and attentive to your recommendation not to spend
more money than I could help, R took a second-class ticket to this
point. It was the day of Oswestry fair, and the train appeared to be
an excursion one provided for the accommodation of the “pleasure-
seekers; ” and, therefore, extremely overcrowded, drawn by a very
wheezy and feeble-bodied engine, and invariably .# everywhere
half an hour after its time: thus providing to passengers the additional
excitement arising from the probability of being run into by the next
express; which, conveying wealthy people on business cannot, of course,
be retarded by any paltry consideration for the lives and limbs of poor
people on pleasure.
I may mention incidentally, that during that part of my ride I was
a good deal gnawed about the legs by a pig, which travelled with us
in a sack, under the restraint of which garment it seemed, not
unnaturally impatient. Its companion and proprietor seemed highly to
enjoy the little diversion afforded by his four-legged friend. I was
also much *:: in the face by the umbrellas and parasols of unpro-
tected females tumbling into the carriage in a state of excitement, an
armed with sheaves of these weapons, which they protruded recklessly.
Nor was my enjoyment materially heightened } the playful humour of
several large and energetic young gentlemen, whom I found to be iron-
workers in various ways, and who, no doubt from habitually talkin
against the roar of blast furnaces and the clang of steam hammers, h
... the practice of invariably roaring at the top of their voices,
and who made me an involuntary confidant of their amours, adventures,
and achievements during the fair, which did not appear to be relished
by the unprotected females of whom I have spoken.
We reached Wolverhampton at last, about an hour after our time,
but fortunately uninjured. I had anxiously repeated my inquiries at
all the stations along the road, as to the possibility of my getting on to
town. I had been invariably assured by the station-masters and others
high in office on the different platforms, that this was practicable. On
making the same inquiry at Wºº. of a porter, he was just
informing me that | was in error and could not get further than
Birmingham, when, he was checked by a gentleman very tightly
buttoned up in authority and a blue coat, who assured me that it
was all right, and that I should find myself at Euston |. at six,
A.M. “Take this gentleman's luggage to a cab,” he added, authori-
tatively, in conclusion.—“Don’t I go on from here?” “No, Sir.
You leave this line here and catch the Birmingham train at Willenhall
Heath” (I think this was the name, but I am not sure). I felt
awkward, but was re-assured by the porter, who informed me cheer-
fully that “he supposed the trains was changed, for he knowed I
couldn't a' got on last week.”
“It's only a mile and an arſ,” he said, by way of cheering me up, as
he turned the handle of my cab door. The night was squally and
dismal. Wolverhampton is not, I believe, a cheerful place at any time,
to persons unaccustomed to breathe carbonic acid gas instead of the
usual quality of atmospheric air. I was trundled along, I think, for
some three-quarters of an hour through miry, and plashy roads, lit up
by blazing chimneys and lurid furnace-mouths, which filled the air
with a red lowering light, as if there was an extensive fire going on
everywhere at the same time. We stopped.
I found myself opposite a yawning cavern. “Down there, Sir,”
said my driver, cheerfully.—“Where P’” I asked * “The station, Sir,”
he replied, nodding with his chin towards the cavern.—I walked down.
He followed me, bearing the luggage. I found myself on a narrow
deserted platform, flanked by a small two-roomed , station, with
a large board informing me I was 14 miles from Birmingham, 126 from
London, and some distance I forget from Liverpool. he information
. have been interesting under other circumstances, but here it
rather depressed me. I was roused by my driver's cry of “porter,”
which rang through the cavern we had come through, and along the
solitary platform; a railway lamp burnt in a melancholy manner under a
bench-but no living soul except our two selves was to be seen.
“There aint nobody'ere,” said the driver, putting down my modest
baggage. I felt the truth of his remark, forcibly, and proceeded at
his request to pay him his fare. It was 1s. 6d. All my silver was a
-crown: of course he had no change. At this moment a step ran
through the cavern. Oh joy! it was a railway policeman, of stai
appearance and dignified demeanour. “Can you give me change for

87
half-a-crown?” I asked him eagerly. “Sir, I’ve only got three 'apence
in the world,” was his discouraging reply, - -
I gave my driver the half-crown *i; I heard him drive off.
Istood alone with the dignified policeman. He looked vacantly at my
lu . . “Where are the porters?” “They’ve gone to bed.”—
“Where is the station-master?” “He’ve gone to bed.”—“Where's
the refreshment room?” (I had eaten nothing since three.) “There
ain't none.”—“Where’s the waiting room?” “It’s shut up.”—“When
will the train to Birmingham be by ?” “Arf arter twelve.”—“Does
it go onto London?” “No.”—“Then I can’t get on to town to-night?”
"No.”—“They told me I could at the other station.” “Ah—they
allus’ does; but you can't.”—“The devil I can't!” “No.”
- - - - -
Here I omit a scene of expletives on my part, of impassive silence
on that of the staid policeman. “But what’s to be donº ºi don’t
know.”—“Can I get a cab back to Wolverhampton?” “There aint
no cabs here.”—“Can I get a bed here?” “I don't know. You
may try at the Hotel up yonder.”—“Oh! there is a Hotel.” “Yes.”
—“Then I’d better sleep there, and go on by the first train to-
morrow morning?” “Well, I don’t know—pr’aps you may get a bed
—but I think they’re shut up.”—“Shut up at half-past ten o’clock!”
“Well—they’re rayther unregular people, and sometimes shuts up
early.”—“At least I can try—” “Yes, you can try.”—“Will you
carry my luggage up?” “Well, I don't mind.”
The staid man took up m luggage and preceded me, wheezing
º: Porterage was evidently not his forte. We reached the
otel, a building, as well as the darkness enabled me to make it out, of
highly decorated Elizabethan architecture. My conductor knocked
at the front door. No answer. We walked round the house and
knocked and rang at all the doors we came to. At last, a window on
the first floor was cautiously opened—“Who’s there?” asked a female
voice. “It’s me, m’m,” answered the policeman respectfully.—“Oh,
it’s you, MR. Mouldy, is it?” “Yes, m’m, it's me.”—“Well,
MR. Mouldy, what is it?” “It’s a gent, m'm, as wants a bed.”–
“Oh, a gent as wants a bed?”, “Yes, mºm.”—“Well, we’re shut
up-but I’ll see.” Hereupon the head was withdrawn, and an animated
conversation appeared to be proceeding within. Lights moved slowly
from window to window. I filled up the time with a few more ex-
pletives: the staid policeman remained calm and impassive. At last
the female head reappeared. “He can have a bed, MR. Mouldy.” I
felt, then, how entirely I owed this favour to MR. Mogudy. In about
five minutes a door was lingeringly unbolted by a slip-shod servant-
maid, carrying a small but º dip, apparently swooning
away in a dirty brass candlestick. R. Mouldy carried in my luggage
and deposited it solemnly on the passage mat.
The slip-shod maid looked at me uncomfortably and questioningly.
“Well, can I have a bed?” I asked rather savagely. “I think so.”
“No supper, I suppose?—“Well, they’re all in bed”, MR. Mouldy
touched his hat and left me alone with the slatternly maid-servant.
“You are not going to give me that candle, I hope?” She looked
at me wonderingly, then at the candle, and at last slowly moved away
with her dip, leaving me in darkness on the door-mat.
- - * - -
She returned in a few minutes with another dip, even more power-
fully smelling, and more helplessly inclined to one side, with a more
*:::: fungus of a wick, and in a more offensive brass candlestick than
e other.
"At least you can give me a pair of snuffers?” She gazed at me
again...with the same wondering expression, and retired, carrying
both dips with her.
I stood again in darkness on the door-mat.
- - - - -
. She returned, bringing with her a tiny pair of brass snuffers, weak
in the joint, with one, finger-ring #. and with a box of insufficient
capacity to accommodate half the fungus already accumulated on that
atrocious dip. -
"I go by the first train at seven in the morning: may Irely on being
called?” “Well, they’re mostly up in the mornings.”—“Can I have
any breakfast before starting?” “They’ll have to get up earlier to
git you breakfast.”—I felt it was hopeless. “Never mind, I won't
take breakfast.”
She seemed relieved by this, and preceded me slowly upstairs into a
fusty little room. I found the sheets tolerably clean, and resigned
myself to my fate. I need not attempt to describe the night I spent.
y.room-window, opened on to the railway station; sleep-walking
engines were wandering uncomfortably up and down all night, sighing,
squealing, fizzing, and growling, in the usual depressive manner of
these overworked machines. I felt sure no one would be awake to call
me, and, of course, counted the clock all night till I heard six strike.
Ispring out of bed joyfully, and began to dress. I pass by the
toilet-table. The soap was of the flinty description one might expect
in such a place. I had one small and very º towel, and the wash-
stand was one of those inaccessible triangular arrangements, over
which washing consists in knocking your head against the wall in the
abortive attempt to get it over the basin.
At last I concluded my apology for a wash, and going to the door for
my boots, found them absent. I rang. Ten minutes elapsed. The
engines appeared to me now to be wide awake, and I inferred the
speedy starting of the train. I rang more wildly. The slipshod maid-
servant appeared. “My boots!” I exclaimed. She disappeared. Ten
minutes more elapsed. I rang furiously. She reappeared with my
boots, which she put down with the simple words: “They ain’t
cleaned 'em.”
By heavens—my boots were there, dusty and dirty, as I had put
them off on arriving ! . It was perfect: I felt grateful they had not
cleaned them, for then I should not have enjoyed my night fully—and
one thing would have been done at this mysterious hotel, as it is done
in other places of public entertainment. I paid for my bed; nobody
was up in the house but the slip-shod maid.
I felt a grim sort of cheerfulness, as I walked to the station, at the
thought that I had passed the most uncomfortable night in the world.
If any blasé traveller desire to try this pleasure, he has only to follow
my example, to go to North Wales, and take “the pleasant way home,”
viá Wolverhampton.

exclaimed, "To you, Prince, the initiative—to us, the unhesitating execution.'"
Execution is just the word for such services. When we recollect the
butcheries that took place in December, the Prince may well be proud
of having such “unhesitating erecutioners.”
Much of a Muchness.
The parties indicted for the Stockport Riots were stated in the
papers as seven Protestants and eight Papists; but we are enabled to
affirm that these figures convey an erroneous impression, the fact being
that the rioters were precisely six of one and half-a-dozen of the other.
The same THING.

A KIND WORD WITH JONATHAN.
PERIsh all the cod and mackerel in the Ocean—fine eating
as they are—before we go to war with brother Jonathan for
a cause as scaly as any fish can be that have no scales. We
can't think of quarrelling with Jonathan about fish at a time
when our general enemy is plotting everywhere to reduceus,
in a greater measure than we like, to a fish diet; and would
if possible, move all the nations, and Heaven and Earth, and
another place also, even worse than Ireland, against us for
that end. We must recollect that JonATHAN is now the only
national creature of any importance, except ourself, that is not
priest-ridden and soldier-ridden; the Soldier in the saddle, and
the Jack-Priest on the crupper. Our natural relation to
Jonathan at present should be that of a league, offensive and
defensive, against despotism and papal petticoat government
all over the world. We may, however, remonstrate with
Jonathan in a brotherly way on occasion; and we do so
remonstrate with him respecting the following passage from
the New York Herald, on the ºl. that it correctly
expresses his mind as to the matter between us:
“It is a shame that the great expedition to Japan, for a hydrographical
survey of those islands, and the conversion of the heathen therein to com-
merce and Christianity —it is a burning shame that the expedition for these
greatobjects should be broken up, from the necessity of detailing the flag-ship
# the jommodore to the protection of our Yankee fishermen in the Bay of
undy."
Now, Jonathan, are you not, taking this querulous—and
audibly nasal—tone rather inconsiderately? Does it not occur
to you, that you, are, a little inconsistent, in setting, out to
convert the heathen to “Commerce and Christianity” in one
quarter of the globe, and going a-poaching in the other?... .
. Never mind your collocation of “Commerce and Chris-
tianity.” Success to you in your endeavour to convert the
Japanese to both your religions.
How to Make One Dizzy.
Take one half Protection, and one half Free Trade, and
pour from one Conservative measure to another, until you get
a fine head with plenty of froth. It is this mixture of half-and-
balſ, smartly combined, that makes one Dizzy.
THE
wanted a DIPLOMatist.
WHERE is the celebrated statesman, M. PiscAtoRy? He
would be the man to negotiate for us with the Americans the
settlement of our dispute about fishing.
THE LAST KICKS OF PUFFERY.
MAD attempts are being continually made to give to even the air an
air of novelty. A few days ago an individual to whom it is immaterial
whether he stands on his head or his heels, lowered himself by going
up in a balloon, from which he was suspended so fearfully that it was
a moment of horrid suspense to all who looked on, as well as to the
aéronaut. He, however, seemed to be quite at home, and neither to
care where he happened to hang out, or to feel, the inconvenience of
being completely tied by the leg, for the time being. It is true that
he did it as easily as if he had been “native and to the manner born,”
for the operation; but a man who is “born to be hanged,” even by the
leg, is scarcely a desirable person for the public to make acquaint-
ance with.
This, however, is nothing to the ascent of Monsieur Poitevin, with
a carriage and four—a feat that might terminate rather awkwardly for
those on terra firma, inasmuch as if the exhibitor were to throw himself
on the public, or to tumble on the public, which would be much the
same thing, the effect would be, far from agreeable. As to science
being aided by these pieces of fool-hardiness, the idea is absurd, and we
think M. Poitevin himself, with his carriage and four in the air,
would be puzzled to tell us what he is driving at.
No Getting Out of It.
THE MARQUIs of LoNDONDERRY can get nothing out of Louis
NAPoleon respecting the liberation of ABD-EL-KADER; his HIGHNess
having seemingly condemned himself to the silent system for his breach
of promise sooner or later to set the Emir at liberty. The PREsident
is unable to get out of his unenviable position; but the person most to
º sympathised with (not most to be pitied) who can't get out, is the
captive chief.
A GOLD MINE OF ADVERTISEMENTS.
HE venerable old proverb
tells us that “What is one
man's meat is another man's
poison,” but with regard to
the strychnine, we think we
can alter the proverb to
“What is one man's poison
is another man's meat,” con-
sidering the source of profit
it has been to the brewers.
Never did anybody of trades-
men derive so much benefit
from a libel as our Bitter Ale
manufacturers. They have
advertised, their innocence
far, and wide, with testimo-
nials of the purity of their
beer, and the price of each
barrel. Thousands have been
spent in proving that this
strychnine was the most bit-
ter calumny that was ever in-
vented topoison honestmen's
characters. One brewer, we
are told, is prepared to spend
£5000 in advertisements in
order to wash himself as
clean as his rivals, in the
estimation of the public. We are not at liberty to mention, his name,
|but we can safely say that, in this instance, Bass is not “the Slave
that pays.”

HINTS TO YOUNG YACHTSMEN.
E will resume our pleasant col-
Rººſ loquial advice. You observe,
º that it was “ PLEBson’s
fault,” that the Parvenu and
Bubble fouled each other in
the race for the crown. , Very
possibly. I really must decline
ſº into the inquiry; and
ad I been at your dinner at
the George the day after, I
should have been ineffably
bored by the discussion.
Having seen fifteen sail of
the line come into Malta
Harbour without an atom of
disturbance, I cannot be ex-
pected to sympathise with
any such bungling. But why
would PLEBson sail her, him-
self, just at the most critical
period of the race? Ah, that’s
the rub | Why does BUng-
LeRTON “accept office,” and
throw his family, into agonies
of apprehension? Why did Jones write a tragedy on the subject of
Most Ezuma º The truth is, that PLEBson falls into a not uncommon
error. He is not content to be a yachtsman, but must needs be a
naval man—must mount a couple of brass guns, and give his poor
little Parvenu the airs of a man-of-war. By Jovel everything goes on,
on board that cutter, as if she was commanded by Collingwood, or
that ever-to-be-lamented hero on whom all our youth model them-
selves, in the service—of course I mean BENBow.
There are two extremes which often meet in harbours—I mean the
man-of-war that apes the yacht, and the yacht that apes the man-of-
war. Sometimes a line-of-battle ship is seen where i.; 18
paint and polish—where the tompions in the mouths of the guns look
so deuced meat, that it would be a pity to take them out to fire. The
Parvenu, again, is the extreme that meets this; and PLEBson half
fancies that he bears the Queen's commission. You must have heard,
I suppose, of one gallant yachtsman who wanted to have power to flo
his men. This may be º: of scandal; but I can fancy the morbi
appetite. 1 believe, indeed, that he formed a contract to that effect with
one or two of his crew, and paid them extra wages, accordingly. It
seems odd, certainly, to pay for the whistle--of the lash. Keep your
eye on your friend #º, or he will be imitating this greatman, and
turning the hands up “to punishment,” with the gravity of the
genuine performer. - -
And consider how naval men would necessarily laugh at your friend
PLEBson's affectation. A better-natured set of ſellows as a body
doesn't exist—but perhaps their one weakness is a tendency to laugh
at any absurdity which sins against orthodox nauticality. To be sure,
I don’t see how a “tinker” is necessarily, as the naval mind would
seem to suppose, a supremely, contemptible person, much less a
: cobbler.” But they are right in laughing at pretenders in their own
line. They most cordially enjoy, I assure you, the beautiful little
eccentricities of LoRD MuddleR, when he comes down from the
Admiralty to “inspect” a ship, and walks slap towards, the stern,
instead #. angway, &c. So, be sure, friend PLEBson will come in
for his share .F.; if this advice does not make him amend his ways.
I am afraid you suffer a good deal from the predatory incursions of
ºt º: ” from men-of-war. A greater set of vultures than these
fellows it would be difficult to find. And the worst of it is, that they
look on a “T. G.” or travelling gentleman, as they call, a civilian, as
their legitimate prey. The pompous old proprietor of that big yacht, the
Lamberer, mistook one of these precocious cubs for a matured tar,
when he saw him knocking about in a white jacket in summer. He
en d him to sail the Lumberer somewhere, and the fellow (who was
indignant at being taken for a “plebeian,” as he afterwards said,) took
the old gentleman a cruise which he won't forget in a hurry, I know.
I have no objection to a certain moderate luxury in the fitting up of
our yacht—all within reasonable bounds. I know that the Diddler
}. the armorial bearings of Fitz-OFFAL on the stern—which is clearly
intended for the benefit of his creditors, who find that portion of the
vessel the one oftenest presented to them.

A SQUEAK FOR THE BRITISH DRAMA.
“MR. PUNCH,
“I am one of the swinish multitude. Understand me; I
intend no figure of speech: my ºff. runs upon, four legs; I am
in fact, the entire animal; and send you this, writ with one of my own
bristles in rose-pink, from the Haymarket Theatre. I am descended in
a right line-and no gammon—from Toby the learned pig, which may
account for my letters. However, what's birth” When one comes to
be cut into rashers or put in a playbill, quarterings go for nothing.
For here I am in a playhouse! Here I am, as sure as eggs are eggs,
and as I myself may be bacon and bacon.
“This, Mr. Punch, is a free country; and I do not feel disposed—I
never did-to submit to any violence, without having a good squeak
for it. I ask it—is my arena the stage P. Is my forte, eccentric
comedy? When nature gave me four legs—(that is, two hands and two
hams)—did she intend that they should run in a drama of grilling—I
mean, of thrilling—interest? What have I to do with any Writing on the
h/all; especially when such . on a wall is only a play-bill poster.
“My business in life is to do nothing but quietly, soberly, to become
pork. Bacon may be my mission. But, certainly, I was never intended
to shine in the British drama. Besides, when that drama has all the
brutes of the field and all the birds of the air open to it—when your
legitimate dramatist may go, so to speak, into the Zoological Gardens,
and take his pick and choose of animals, why should he stick his goose-
quill into a pig f · Why not take an elephant P the more especially as I
have heard that elephants and pigs are proved by MR. BüFroN to be
of the same family; though, if so, I must say it, the elephants have
always treated the hogs as Christians treat their poor relations. But
why take a pig f I repeat-I again scream that question—why, in a
drama, take a live pig P But I will answer the question, as—yes—as I
have already heard it answered on these boards.
“‘Why a live pig P. Oh, it gives a reality to the scene: makes the
**ś you know.”
“Well, then, why not a real blind beggar—why not a real felon—why
have any acting—illusion, I believe it's called—at all? Bother art?
Let’s have real, naked nature.
“Mr. Punch, pigs have been greatly honoured in their day. There
was MoRLAND, the painter, painted pigs that you might almost nose’em,
almost hear 'em grunt. But then this was art, Sir. Yes; but art
thrown away. . If the real thing is the thing, have a real hog in your
parlour, and don't hang him on your walls. The stage—I give you
what I beard our prompter say—the stage, Sir, should be illusion; not
a real pig-stye : if real pigs, why not, in the farm-yard, a real dung-cart
with everything to match?
“And you will perceive, Mr. Punch, that we—I mean myself and my
two brothers, who, I'm ashamed to say, not being literary, do not feel
as I do the degradation of their present state, making as free with all
the actors, as if they'd known pork all their days—you will, I say,
perceive, that the weight of the play unfairly rests upon us. Now, Sir,
it's all very well with horses, or even dogs, but pigs were never made
to draw. However, to give you what some of the critics say of us. (I
heard one of our brother actors read it from a newspaper, and here it is.)
“When MR. WRight begins to flag, there are some quadrupeds. Three piglings
are introduced in the model farm; and they do wonders in escaping pursuit, consenting
to a recall before the curtain, and finally leaping into the orchestra, where they con-
tributed an adagio movement of squeak, which brought the house down.”
“Now. I ask in the language of the theatre, why should pigs hold
up MR. WRIGHT's train P We can’t gag: no, we can simply grunt
and squeak the author
“I’m ashamed to say it of my two brothers, they were as happy and as
proud as real players; giving themselves no end of airs at the applause,
and specially when called for. But for myself, I felt so ashamed when
among the fiddlers, that I’d sooner been hissed with eggs in a frying-
pan than ; in the orchestra.
“And, Mr. Punch, to end it all—I protest against being used upon the
stage. As a pig, I am the born servant of man, to play, I own, many
parts. Serious hams-eccentric sausages—light rashers—heavy sides
of bacon—tragedy black º Any and many of these parts I
am born to act and double—but, I repeat it, I was not intended to be
dragged upon the stage, and as a free pig in a free country, I raise my
voice against it. “Yours, Mr. Punch,
“One of THE Pigs of THE HAYMARKET.”
“Post-Squeak.-Understand, Idon't complain of salary; pollard's fine
and pease in plenty. I also hear that we're to have—the actors we've
supported could do nº less, not that I care about it—were to have, at
the end of the run real silver rings put in our noses (which are to be
bored for the benefit night of the authors)—as affectionate testimonials.
§§ we've brought a good deal of silver, and we ought to have a little
of it.”

WHAT I
SAW AT THE PAWNBROKER’S.
BY NO MATTER WHO.
F' accident I was present at the Pawn-
|
broker's, at the time that MR. Collins
was “ º: ”. (I believe that is the
term) the portraits that had been en-
trusted to his care for -
his abruptly-finished wor
Statesmen.
This was what I saw.
The first portrait he handed up was
one of LoRD MALMESBURY. For this
the sum of 9s. 8d. was offered—the
Pawnbroker couldn't possibly give more,
he should lose by it as it was; but as
payment was tendered in Austrian bank-
notes, all dirty and torn and tattered,
not unlike his lordship's reputation,
the *. was withdrawn, after a
liberal proposition had been made b
MR. Collins, but refused, to take half
the sum (4s. 10d.) in English money.
The next statesman, handed up for valuation was M.R., BENJAMIN
DisRAELI. The peculiarity of this portrait was that it had two faces
one on each side. One portrait had evidently been taken years ago, an
displayed a Liberal cast of countenance, round and good-humoured,
with a happy smile about the lips, as if the gentleman was pleased
with himself and all the world. The other one showed a Conservative
turn of face, with all the features marrowed and pinched, and a cunning
expression in the eye that seemed to say, “Trust me, and l’ll take you
in.” The Pawnbroker couldn’t give more than £1 for the two portraits.
It was a great pity they were not larger; they would have made a
capital sign-post for an ale-house-for, as it swung backwards and
forwards, it would have shown a different face on each side. One face
would have attracted the Free-traders, and the other one would have
taken in the agriculturists. Ultimately this Jamus-portrait of a states-
man was taken in for 25s. -
LoRD DERby was the next “Eminent Statesman” taken in hand.
The Pawnbroker took it to the window, held it ". turned it in all
}. directions, but a parently could not see his Lordship in a
avourable light. “Ten shillings,” he said, “and really that's more
than his intrinsic value. I know his Lordship will very quickly be on
the shelf, and then he will remain there all his life.” RD LeRBY
was ultimately withdrawn, for MR. Collins felt that, as an English-
man, he could not let the Prime Minister of his country go for so
small a figure. -
The Colonial Secretary, and a bag-full of Under-Secretaries were
the next handed over the counter. They belonged to the present
Ministry, but the Pawnbroker indigmantly rejected them, saying,
“They are all a bad lot, and he should be sorry to have anything to do
with them.”
An honourable exception was made, however, in favour of LoRD
MAIDstone, who fetched as much as 7s.6%d. The Pawnbroker thought
he should get his money back again by, selling his Lordship (who, he
had been told, “had some stuff in him,” and I, for my part, did not
doubt the stuff in the least) in Holywell Street, where his portrait
would come in well as a frontispiece to the next edition of “JEAMEs'
SoNGSTER,”
Other “Statesmen” fetched better prices. A faithful portrait of
LoRD John Russell brought 31, 15s.6d, though the Pawnbroker was
afraid “he should have to wait some time for his money, for it was ex-
traordinary how long the people were in appreciating his Lordship's
real merits.”
A good sum was given for a telling portrait of Joseph HUME-for
“now that he was better known, and seen in his proper colours, (here
the Pawnbroker rubbed off with his sleeve a quantity of dust that had
settled upon its countenance,) honest old Joseph's value was, he was
glad to say, better appreciated every year.” The shopman's liberality
warmed with his praises, and he actually gave sixpence more for him
than he had done for Lord JoHN.
MR. MacAULAY ſetched an honourable price, and LoRD PALMERston
commanded as high a sum as any one. “ Íf his Lordship was not
exactly taken up at his full value—and in his opinion there was scarcely
a better man for John BULL's money—at all events his portrait would
come in capitally for a sporting-crib. It would adorn the bar of any
house where the “Fancy” congregated.”
LoRD MANNERs, the MARQUIs of BLANDFORD, LoRD SEYMoUR, MR.
Spoon ER, MR. GeoRGE THOMPson, and several others better known
than admired, were contemptuously refused; “he (the Pawnbroker)
would be sorry to have them at any price.”
I had nearly forgotten to state that the Pawnbroker, whose remarks
and estimates I have been recording, was no less than the celebrated
M.B. PUNCH, who, from his long experience and connections, knows
ublication in
of Eminent
the value of a political “Pledge” better than any one, and can
tell you, to the fraction of a probability, what chance there is of its
ever being redeemed.
I conclude by stating that if any statesman, eminent or otherwise,
who sets a high figure upon himself, wishes to ascertain his real value,
he had better send his portrait at once to MR. PUNCH's shop, where he
will be told in very plain figures, the price he is worth, not exactly in
his own estimation, F. in the estimation of the public.
N.B. No Irish Statesman, no Brass-band Man, need apply.

See the Times, August 4th, 1852.
“DEY must not pass!” was the warning cry of the Austrian sentinel

“They must not pass? Now, wherefore not?” the wond'ring tourist

A FORENSIC FIX.
THE business of the Bar has lately diminished with such alarming
rapidity, that the Circuits are nearly abandoned, and the only bar mess
that remains in force is the terrific mess in which the Bar now finds
itself. Q. C. is begining to stand for Queer Case, in the imagination
of every one who peruses that once enviable appendage to a learned
name: while, as to the Serjeants, many of them find the coif so unpro-
ductive that they would gladly get it off their hands, or off their heads,
at a ruinous sacrifice. W. have heard it rumoured that some of the
Serjeants will apply to the Government to be placed on the list of
jºf officers, under the new Militia Bill. They will
undertake to provide their own powder, which is now of no use to their
wigs, and, though not recently accustomed to go into action, they will
resume their ; practice with alacrity.
The Parliamentary Races.
MANY riders have been thrown during the recent Election Heats,
and have met with various accidents; but for none do we feel so deeply
as for the noble HoRsMAN who lost his seat at Cockermouth, just as
every one made sure that he was going to win. . This accident is the
more to be regretted, as he will not be able to show at the next Par-
liamentary meet, where his absence will be severely feit, for there is
not another Hors.MAN in the country to be compared to him-more
especially for a good Steeple-chase.

§§§ STRIKE, BUT HEAR.
Lobo St. LEONARDs has spread a perfect
panic throughout the Chancery Bar, by the an-
nouncement that in certain cases he does not
mean to hear more on each side than one counsel.
This startling piece of intelligence, is dealt to
the hundred %. non-entities, who never did
anything but “follow on the same side,” which
means “feed upon the same pocket.” Those
rising young men who were in the habit of ºf
on the back rows to bow their consent on behalf
of some helpless infant, or some unconscious
“party” several degrees removed from all sub-
stantial interest in any portion of the suit but
the amount of its costs, will find that their
graceful obeisances no longer command a couple
of guineas—with half-a-crown for an apocryphal
clerk-in the legal market. The mute eloquence
of some half-dozen long-winded orators—whose
eloquence is, so far mute that it really says
nothing-will henceſqrth be dispensed with, and
they will be spared the necessity of lazily mum-
bling—like the dogs of law—the bones of legal
contention.
The effect of the silent system upon the Chan-
cery Bar will, no doubt, bevery severely felt, but
however seriously the penalty may fall on the
gentlemen of the long robe-and longer tongue
—it will effect a great saving in the time of the
public, and in the money of the suitors in equity.

CATNACH IN THE DRAWING-ROOM.
“WHAT is the use of teaching girls music?” grunts an old single
gentleman. “Ninety-nine out of a hundred never play a tune after
marriage; and as many as give up the hope of a husband, also give up
the piano. I say, then, what's the use of teaching a parcel of girls-

“Why, my dear sir,” replies the nephew or other junior addressed,
“for the same reason, as that, for which you were taught. Latin and
Greek. ...You have laid aside the classics for some time, Sir ; but you
retain their influence. The liberal sciences, as the ſ: says in
the Grammar, have softened your manners, and not suffered them to
be brutal. (The old gentleman coughs.) Music refines the feelings,
cultivates the higher sentiments, arouses noble emotions, produces
kind, amiable, generous, holy, heavenly frames, and phases of mind;
awe, reverence, unearthly supernatural hope, and triumph, and §.
“Bosh, Sir!” exclaims the old gentleman. “Listen to this, Sir:”
and he reads the following advertisement from the Times:–
H, TAKE ME NOT TO OTHER LANDS. Price 2s. 6d. The interest
of the subject, the beautiful simplicity of the melody, and the splendid illustration,
contribute so much to the success of this ballad that it may be safely anticipated it
will become one of the most popular of the day. Sent, post free, on receipt of postage
stamps.
“There, Sir,” the old gentleman continues. “What do you think
of that, Sir. That, Sir, is one of your fashionable songs. Will you
tell me, Sir, that such music as this—for I suppose the tune expresses
the same thing as the words-can inspire young ladies with those fine
ideas which you describe”. Sir, the only feeling it is calculated to
excite in a girl's mind, as it appears to me, is a very improper one; a
spirit of disinclination to accompany a husband, or parent, or guardian,
who may find it expedient or necessary to take her abroad. Besides,
Sir, I strongly suspect that this ballad is intended to º to a vul
and morbid º I apprehend the interest of the subject relates
to some recent family exposure, involving hysterics, that has occurred
in fashionable life. Sir, such music smells—if music can be said to be
odorous-of-hartshorn and burnt feathers. Allusion, I see, is made to
a splendid illustration, on the back of the song, of course, and consisting,
1 suppose, of the portrait of some die-awa Beauty, in tears and the
last nºw Parisian costume for Au st; , Bah, Sir 'Will you love me
after as you did before ?’ ‘Yes, I will love thee as I used.’ ‘They've
given her to some one else;’ this is the kind of stuff you get squalled
about through having your girls taught music. This is your fashionable
Slnging.
*ś, so, Sir,” says the younger gentleman. “But you see, Sir,
they don't teach our girls music., They only half, teach them, Sir.
They educate their fingers and windpipes; their lumbricales and crico-
arylaenoidei muscles: but not their higher senses; their imagination
and taste, and that perception of the ludicrous, mortal to spooneyism
and snobbery, which should be developed or cultivated by the regular
perusal of Punch.”
LAW AND LUNACY.
An Advertisement appeared the other day in, thºſº, headed with
the remarkable words “InsANITY WANTED !” We did not proceed
further in the perusal of an announcement, the first words of which
took us, so thoroughly a back, and we therefore cannot undertake tº
say what the circumstances may be, under which so remarkable a want
has been notified. We can only conjecture that the advertisement
proceeds from some unhappy individual who is in some way a "party
to a suit in Chancery, and who can hardly be blamed for seeking, even
in insanity, a relief from the tortures of equity. If we are right in ºur
guess, the wretched advertiser will find no escape in lunacy from the
terrors of Chancery for, as if to preserve its power and allow none to
escape who have at any time been within the fangs of the court, those
whom it first destroys and then drives mad, it continues to preside, over.
The desired change from Chancery to Insanity will, in effect, be no
change at all, but merely a step from one division to another of the
dreaded court—a step, in fact, out of the frying-pan into the fire.
The Newest French Fashion.
The Assemblée Nationale says
“At present in France, irreligion has gone out of fashion.”
And religion is fashionable. Very fashionably dressed, too, does
Religion come out, blessing colours, eagles, and the like. in fact, this
altogether seems to be Religion, after a fashion. The Univers is the
journal of French “Religion;” but it is not an adequate one. The
priest party, to do themselves justice, should seek an organ in Le Follet.

FESTIVE FOOLERY.
OMEBODY-who happens to be a mere
nobody—has just come of age at a
place in Salop, and his arrival at years
of discretion has been celebrated by
an excess of absurdity which, we may
hope, he regarded as a sort of farewell
to foolery. The programme, which has
been forwarded to us, gives an order
of procession, commencing with Two
TRUMPETERs and terminating with a
Couple of SHEEP, who are expected
to bring up their own and the general
rear, for the purpose of being converted
during the evening into haunches of
mutton. The whole thing savours of
absurdity, and seems to be, after all,
a cheap mode of making a display:
for trumpeters are cheap enough in
the Metropolis—we have known them
as low as eighteen-pence a pair at this
season of the year.
The appearance of the “tenantry”
in a procession is always a great
point; and when our son comes of
age, we shall certainly request our
first-floor lodger to fall into line with
our tenant of the second pair at the
first landing, and there wait for the
descent of the attic, so that “the
whole of the tenantry” may be con-
centrated on the joyous occasion. We
shall then furnish the party with
instructions, as to the line of route,
commencing at the point of starting, proceeding down the stairs, along
the passage, out by the back-door into the yard, round the water-butt,
passing the dust-hole on the right, pausing opposite the beer-barrel to
drink the heir’s health, and returning by the back-yard door into
the front passage, where a congratulatory address will be spoken by
the tax-gatherer, being the last quarter's receipt, mounted on a pencil
by way of banner. Perhaps when heirs find how easily the sort of thin
may be adapted to the very meanest (pecuniary) capacity, they w
cease to make themselves ridiculous in this way, at any rate.
THE CRYSTAL PALACE OF THE PEOPLE.
To the Home Secretary (Private and Confidential).
A woºd in your ear, MR. WALPoLE. There is treason, hydra-headed
treason hatching. Now, we are not joking. , Were we inclined to
be droll, we would not cast our jokes before certain Home Secretaries.
Hush! This way. ... In a corner, if you please.
Do you ever see the Morning Herald? We thought so. Somehow,
ou look as if you did. Still, we have brought a copy. Here it is. A
eader on the treasonous atrocities contemplated, by the traitorous
projectors of the Crystal Palace in Penge Park | We will read you—
when we can get a good mouthful of breath—a few of the lines: the
dreadful lines. You see, the Palace is to be open on Sundays after one
o'clock. In that fact the Herald sees revolution, anarchy, and perhaps
—a future republic with John CRomwell BRIGHT in Buckingham
Palace | Listen—
“Go to mass on the Sabbath morning,' is the Church of Rome's command.—‘then, go
to the park, the ball, or the theatre.' That is the Sabbath of Paris, of Munich, of
Vienna, and we are sorry to say, of Berlin also. And, as one natural result, a single
month, in 1848, saw the Sovereigns of Paris, of Vienna, of Munich, and of Berlin,
fugitives before their rebellious subjects. The people of England remained untouched by
this sudden madness;–they were loyal to their Queen, because they feared their God!”
. You will perceive, Right Honourable Sir, that had the Palace existed
in Penge Park in 1848, the British Throne would have gone to bits like
a smashed decanter. The QUEEN has only continued to reign because
there has been no People's Palace
We see, sir, you are moved, but let us go on.
“The Crystal Palace will be the main engine for introducing the continental Sabbath
among us. The people may go to church, it will be said, and then they may go down
to Sydenham and enjoy a walk in the Crystal Palace, and what harm can that do? " -
* * * * Just all the harm in the world. Open and naked profaneness would shock
most persons, but this mixture of religion and dissipation will ruin myriads!”
Myriads, Right Honourable Sir, myriads ! And then the drunkenness
that will abound will be dreadful. No; not open and naked drunken-
ness; because no intoxicating liquors will be sold; but there, there the
danger. The materials for intoxication will be upon the premises.
Drunkenness will be made . to the senses. ...And in this manner.
There will be no gin, certainly hut there will be the juniper-tree,
fatally suggestive to the Sabbath mind of “Cream of the Walley,” and
“Old Tom.” . Rum, as rum, is not to be thought of; but—and we
wonder, Right Honourable Sir, that the analytical, the logical intellect
of the Herald has missed it—but, if there be not rum in the glass,
there will be the sugar-cane growing; there will be rum in its purely
vegetable condition. And can it be thought that “Fine Old Jamaica.”
ill not be extracted—mentally extracted—by the Sunday visitor?
Again, we shall no doubt have the tobacco-plant in every variety. Of
course the Sunday visitor will—in idea we mean—inevitably put that
in his imaginary º and smoke it!
Therefore, Right Honourable Sir, to imitate the logic of the pious
Morning Herald, (not one type of that luminous print is, of course,
lifted until after Sunday midnight!)—therefore, with juniper-trees, with
sugar-canes, and with tobacco growing in the Palace—and that Palace
thrown #. after one o'clock on Sundays—therefore, nothing will be
seen, nothing smelt, but men, women, aye, and even children—(think
of that, Right Honourable Sir, the rising generation!) reeling about
with gin and rum, and those not drunk stupefied—brutally
fied—with the fumes of tobacco 1
e know that the gin is only in the tree; the rum in came; the
tobacco green and unplucked : nevertheless, the influence, the sugges-
tiveness of their presence will, in the pro hetic words of the Herald,
“ruin myriads.” Yes, Right Honourable Sir, myriads.
We have done our duty, a difficult and a painful one, MR. WALPole.
We have been compelled to make you listen to the Morning Herald.
But for all that, you will bear us no malice.
We see you are in a hurry to leave us. Things of import—determi-
nation strong—crowd and darken in that official face
You will immediately arrest Fox and HENDERson, and FULLER, and
PAXTON, upon a charge of constructive treason—i.e., building the
revolutionary fabric—and thereupon send them to the Tower.
N& i. please: but we think the Tower too good for them. Try
ewgate.

ATRIMONY.—The Advertiser, aged Forty, of improving political con-
nections, and being as well known for his independence of mind as he is for his
independence of fortune, is anxious to form a MATRIMONIAL ALLIANCE with a
Young Lady, not older than himself, who might be able to command, if not an army,
at least the means of procuring one in the hour of necessity. Temper is of no kind
of object, as political influence in the scale of Europe is the grand thing needed. If
this influence in the scale can be further increased by the weight of a fortune suffici-
ently large to turn the scale in the Advertiser's favour, so much the better. Absence
from England having somewhat limited the circle of his respectable acquaintance,
induces him to take this now not very unusual mode of making known his wishes.
Has every reason to believe his name and position would, upon acquaintance, make
any one happy who accepted his hand, though it still might bear upon it the stains of
recent political events. Any Young LADY answering this proposal, must send with
it medical certificates of her having been vaccinated, as well as her Portrait, the
likeness of which must be attested by two of her dearest friends.-Address, under the
cover of secrecy, to L. N., Elysée, Paris, marked outside, “Tender.”

THE PALM-TREES OF PARIS.
Nobody has planted so many palm-trees as Louis NAPOLEoN ; but
then, somehow, they will not take root. Either the soil is not con-
genial to them—they will not flourish in the Elysian Fields of France—
or the man is a bad gardener; a bungling hand at his business. For
instance, “the palm-trees erected in the Champs Elysées, although
supported by strong bars of iron, have been seriously injured,” says an
observer. One of them “was broken in the centre, and in its fall
crushed a wooden house.” Broken in the centre, although supported
with iron; neither did the iron—the strong bar of iron-save its fall
tha crushed a wooden house !
There is an omen, there is a moral in these accidents. Somehow,
iron will not always work the will of the despot: it will do much, but
—whether it is the weakness of tyranny to expect too much of it—the
metal will not do all things; will not “go thorough.” Now the palm-
tree supported by iron—a withering palm-tree, with no roots
grappling the soil of France, and from the soil drawing no principle of
a fruitful vitality—is, the very type of that peace that NAPOLEON
Louis has given, to France. It must be supported by iron: and so
it is, for a time. And then the winds begin to whistle, and then to roar,
and then crack goes the palm in the very centre—the dead, rotten
º falling, crushes a house as it were a band-box. Stronger,
ardier, is the living palm—the vital type of peace—in its deep hold of
the earth; self-grasping, self-maintaining. There is life in it; a life
that withstands the tempest. But with no root, it goes in a storm
like a rotten birch-twig; even though “supported by iron.”
ECONOMY IN ROYAL SALUTES.
“ScIENTIFIC PUNCH, . .
“GREAT objection is made to the waste of gunpowder which
is made in firing salutes. To save this expense, and at the same time
preserve for illustrious personages the honour of being stunned, let me
recommend to the notice of the Lords of the Admiralty the substance
called Quadrochloride of Nitrogen; which is one of the most explosive
compounds known. You make it by simply setting a jar of chlorine to
stand inverted in a solution of sal-ammoniac: materials cheap enough.
A drop of it no bigger than a pea goes off with a loud bang; and avery
small quantity of it would make a greater noise than a forty-pounder;
besides which, it has the advantage of being extremely dangerous, and
much more likely than gunpowder to blow hands off; moreover, of
smelling perhaps worse. Of the truth of these statements, I am ready
to take my “DAVY.”

THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF LITTLE
BRITAIN. -
This learned body has been holding its annual meeting in a lively
spirit, with instructive results.
The day before yesterday, a most valuable paper was read by
PROFEssor PUMPKIN, F.S.A., proving that JACK SHEPPARD was a real
and not a mythical personage. A parish register produced by the
learned gentleman shows that one JAMEs SHEPHERD or SHEPPARD was
married at Penzance in 1700; and an authentic document of forty years'
later date, which can be traced to the great grandson of GeoRGE
The Second's Court Barber, mentions one ZACHARY SHEPPARD as
one of the Yeomen of the Guard; which ZACHARY, ZACH., or JACK
SHEPHERD was clearly identical with the famous hero and saint of the
Newgate Calendar.
Yesterday, a highly-important lecture was delivered by DR, RUM-
MADGE, so well known by his antiquarian researches, demonstrating in
the most satisfactory manner that no such person as the highwaym
called by tradition Jack SHEPPARD, ever existed. The SHEPPARDs o
Sheppard's Bush came originally, from Gloucestershire, and after
residing for some generations at Bagnigge Wells, seated themselves
in their present domain, where they have long hung out; but it is not
the fact that any one of them was hanged at Tyburn. The only W.
known as JACK SHEPPARD, contemporaneously with JonATHAN WIKD
was a respectable Baptist minister, whose real name was Stokes an
who was called “The SHEPHERD’’ as a nickname.
Both lectures were listened to with breathless attention, and appeared
to carry conviction to the minds of a crowded auditory.

THE QUEEN AND THE GUNPOWDER PLOT,
We put it to i". man, woman,
and child who have sedu-
lously read their Punch,
whether for years past
Punch has not from time
to time—as he was blinded
by the smoke—cried out
against the bad taste, the
bad manners, of blazing
away in honour of HER
Majesty, nay, of royalty of
any degree, whenever royalty
shall show itself afloat. And
now we are happy to find
that the Times comes to the
support of Punch. We have
again and again given an in-
dignant squeak; and now
the Times loudly protests:
“From word to word leaps the
live thunder."
We had determined to un-
cork our ink-bottle, bringin
it to bear against the blan
broadsides—the loud bullies
meaning nothing—that fol-
lowed HER MAJEsty on her late voyage., “..Had, Queen VICTORIA
been a pigeon,” says the Times—and a dove she is!—“a pigeon let loose
from a trap in Battersea Fields, she could not have been more sedu-
lously º at than during her recent cruise up and down the
Channel.” True enough. Never was there so cruel an exaction of
the powder-tax.
But is not the custom wasteful, barbarous? Or if it be not so, why
not carry it out on all occasions? Why should not the Queen take
horse or carriage exercise in her parks to the roar of artillery P Nay,
why should not all her movements be reported by word of mouth of
cannon? She might rise to a morning-gun, and sink upon her pillow to
the good night of a forty-two pounder. It may be very necessary for
the state and sublime consequence of the King of SIAM—the kin
of the idol elephants—that ‘. subjects, should know by a genera
clangor of Fº and trumpet that—his Ma º has dined! Noise is
an element of barbarous life; but the refined civilities of this our
mortal condition might be unattended by the roar, of cannon; and
Englishmen have too deep a respect, too warm an affection for their
dear little QUEEN that they should, without avery strong remonstrance
see her thus rudely treated by every gun in her navy. Let us, by all
means, when necessary sing “God save the QUEEN,” but let us
protest for all future time against HER MAJESTY-whenever she j
afloat—being saluted by the “adamantine lips” of forty-two pounders.
Noise, however great, is not greatness.

A CASE OF CRADLE.
“MR. PUNCH,
“Gold is the root of evil: I never believed it before; and,
between ourselves, have therefore cultivated that root – I believe
MR, SHAKspeARE calls it. ‘the insane root;' but he was only a play-
writer-early and late. But, Mr. Punch, is it to be borne that men
of capital; men who, in the market and on 'Change, have done their
regular business, º; their desires to a steady stream—(the
stream as deep and as wide as you like)—of profit, should, in their
mature age, with as much silver on their heads as gold in their pockets,
be confounded, thrown upon their backs, Sir–(you will pardon the
force of the expression, for I feel strongly)—by this revolution of the
precious metals P
“Gold fields, Sir!—gold fields! The young men talk of them, as
familiarly as the Copenhagen Fields of my time. As for gold-dust, they
do nothing but, blind themselves with it—that is, to their masters'
interests. Well, what is the consequence P Labour's going up-
clerks used to be a drug in the market; but now one has absolutely to
look for a clerk—as I live, to seek for the article!
“I have—had, I mean—a clerk. I had him for seven years. He
began as junior on 10s. a week — (print this, if you please, as
shillings; with the roman s. not the d.)—and dinner, yes, and tea.
Well, since then, I have gradually raised him—(making his merit, as a
friend of mine finely observes, the thermometer of his salary)—to
one pound per week; or fifty-two º: per year. And—habit grows
upon one—I gradually began to like SAMUEL; so much so, that, with
proper conduct, he might have staid with me all his life upon those
terms: I never told him so—but he might; for as I have said, I
liked him.
“Now, Mr. Punch, you shall judge of the gratitude of this young
man, whom for seven years I had warmed at my desk.
... Where’s SAM?” said I, this morning, seeing nobody on his stool.
::Gone, Sir,’ says the junior clerk, ‘to buy a cradle;’
“‘Buy a cradle !” said I-‘what! has the fool gone and got
married ?” -
“Oh no, Sir,’ says the urchin, enjoying the joke, ‘gone to buy a
cradle to nurse a golden baby when he gets it. SAM's off in a month
to the Diggins, and I’m a going to follow him.”
“There, Mr. Punch. And this is not a single case. A dozen of my
friends are in the like predicament, or I should not have troubled you.
Will not Parliament—will not, at least, MR. DiskAELI interfere? If
this gold madness isn't put into a straight-jacket, there will soon
be no getting a clerk for-no; love is out of the question in business

A Blow for Louis Napoleon.
On the day of the Paris fºtes, it was found impossible to light man
of the NApoleonic devices which were intended to have illuminate
the French capital. The PRINCE PREsipºnt must have been greatly
amazed at the failure of his devices; and it must be admitted that, on
the day in question, there was certainly something in the wind.

HER: break we off,” said papa one morning, as we were walking
a little way out of Brighton. “I shall go and take my bath at
BRILL's, and AUNT RATCHEt and DAUGHTER WIoLET can prolong their
walk according to their own unexceptionable discretion. Only, Miss
BROMPTON, don't let your evident determination to reach Beechey Head
make you too late for lunch.”
We bid him good bye, and he went back for his bath, and an angle of
the road quickly placed us out of sight of each other. In a minute-it
could not have been more—I heard a hasty step close behind us, and
looking back, I saw a gentleman, who instantly raised his hat. I did
not recognise him, but thought at the moment, that one of us had
perhaps dropped something, which the stranger had picked up.
“Your papa, there, desired that I should overtake you, Miss BROMP-
Ton, and your aunt, and introduce myself,” he said, in an exceedingly
soft voice. “He declared he would not be stopped from going to
BRILL’s. Allow me, therefore, to present to you PRINCE CHARLEs
Nicholas Wolgakowkowitch.
“O, indeed,” said AUNTY RATCHET, which perhaps, upon the whole,
was as sensible an answer as could have been made under the circum-
stances. “Are you walking our way, Sir?”
“Unguestionably,” said the Prince, again raising his hat. He was
a rather tall, middle-aged person, with strongly marked features, which
had been handsome, but looked very much worn and haggard. His
black hair was scanty, and dashed with grey. He was dressed in black,
and the only white he exhibited was a high but rather rough-edged
collar. He wore dark gloves, and a small brooch with which the long
ends of his cravat were connected was of jet. He had also a black
cane. His manner was very elaborate, but this I concluded was a
foreign symptom.
“I believe, Miss BRompton,” he said, by way of commencing the
conversation, “that I. father is the very best man in the world.”
Now, as privately I might have entertained some such idea myself, I
only answered that papa was indeed fortunate in securing the kind
regards of a ſº many people.
“Ah,” replied the PRINCE CHARLEs Nicholas; “but some of them
are ignorant wretches, others are worthless donkeys, others again are
malignant idiots, while a fourth class may be considered as thankless
pigs.”
§. arranged this classification of our acquaintances so rapidly that I
had no time to sort them under the different heads, and he hurried on—
“Not one of them would give him a cup of cold water—not one.
They’re not like me, not they.”
AUNTY RATCHET here looked across me at the Prince in such
a funny way, that I concluded she was trying to make up her mind
whether the circumstance last mentioned was an advantage or not.
“No, Miss BROMPTON, no,” he continued, “I am a spirit of another
MISS VIOLET AND HER “OFFERS.”—CHAPTER XVI.
– /
sort. Your father saved my . and though I do not set it at a pin's
fee, I mean to be as grateful as if I did. I have returned from
Russia º for the purpose. The Emperor refused me my
passports, or I should have been here sooner.”
It just then occurred to me that the Prince spoke our language, with
ſº facility, and without any foreign accent; but I remembered that
ussians are celebrated for what I have seen called “the servile power
of acquiring foreign languages.”
“You came from St. Petersburg’” I asked, by way of saying
something.
“I did,” he said, as if catching at the suggestion. “From St. Pe-
tersburg. A fine city, built by PETER THE GREAT. A truly great
man, PETER. Some people said he was a little cracked, but people
always say that of §º. who is in earnest in an age of indifference
es, I came from St. Petersburg. I came for the purpose of seeing
your father, my benefactor.”
I -- | is odd that he should never have mentioned your name to me,”
said.
“Not at all,” he said. “I bound him by a tremendous vow never
to mention it until I gave him leave. I have now given him that leave,
and he may take the biggest speaking-trumpet he can buy for money,
and climb to the very top of Mont Blanc, and thence proclaim to earth
and seas the name of CHARLEs, Nicholas Wolgakowkowitch.”
I could not help laughing to think of my dear, quiet, composed papa
performing such a feat. He looked hard at me.
“Of course, I speak symbolically,” he said, “and not by the card.
You quite understand that I speak symbollically?”
d -- |, imagined so,” I said. "Don't you begin to feel tired, Aunty
ear?”
“Not a bit, child,” replied the stupid honest truthful old darling,
instead of turning round towards Brighton.
“Now,” said the Prince, “I will tell you what your father did for
me, and you shall then judge whether I ought not to be grateful. You
are aware that in Russia we all engage in trade. Excellent well, l
was a fishmonger. On a gigantic scale, of course. I had eight thou-
sand men fishing for me every night, and any one who failed to bring
me one hundred pounds of fish in the morning, was immediately
knouted to death. Excuse these trivial details. Upon one occasion,
a fisherman in my service hooked a tremendous sturgeon, so large, that
it pulled him and four of his companions out of the boat: indeed, they
were all drowned, which is of no consequence in my narrative. The
fish was captured, and when brought into my palace, it reached from
end to end of my principal ball-room.”
“Bless me, Sir! do you have fish brought into your ball-rooms, in
Russia?” asked matter-of-ſact Aunt RATCHET.
“Excuse the jest,” replied the Prince; “but why not one sturgeon

where there were so many pairs of soles?” And he evidently waited
for a laugh; but as none came, he went on.
“I had been giving a splendid fete to all the nobility, gentry, and
clergy of my province, and I astonished them by bringing in my big
fish in the middle of a general Mazourka. It was the largest fish of
the kind ever seen; and, as I need not tell you, we make caviare from
sturgeon-roe, I anticipated a large profit. But some of my guests,
envious at my good, fortune, informed, the Czar. The Father of his
people immediately demanded my fish.”
“Just as the Duke did the Margate whale,” said. Aunty. “I
remember seeing the picture in Punch, of His Grace pulling one way,
and the poor fishermen the other. I am told that they exhibit it along
with the skeleton at Margate.”
“Well, the first message I evaded, by causing the courier, to be
thrown down a precipice. The second I also eluded: my faithful
vassals disposing of the messenger-I never asked how, or for the
money found on the body....But, then the Czar, in a rage, dispatched
GENERAL RUBLEskoff with orders to bring both me and my fish to
the capital; and there’s no playing with the military in Russia. I
sent my “caviare to the General, and surrendered myself prisoner.
The Emperor ordered that I should be thrown into the Neva. The
Emperor was obeyed.”
“But you were not drowned, sir?” said Aunty, who was beginning
to take an intense interest in the narrative, and always liked to know
“whether the executioner got his money.”
“Madam, I will not contradict you. But it would have been my
painful duty to do so, but for the fact that this young lady's father,
then a young man, who was cruising in his yacht, on the river in
question, hooked me out with a boat-hook, and in defiance of the Czar
and all his cannon, set sail, and carried me clean out of the country.”
“Papa own a yacht ! Papa, visit Russia!” And I began to have
some strange misgivings; and this time it was I who was tired, and I
would turn for Brighton.
“Most true,” said the Prince. “For years I dared not return to
my native land; and I lived at Peckham Rye, upon your father's
bounty. At last the Emperor died.”
44 Wii: Emperor f* I asked hastily.
“The EMPEROR PAUL,” replied the Prince, without the least dis-
composure. Q how I looked up and down, then; but there was not a
sing e person in sight.
“And he being succeeded by the present man, Nicholas, (who
always liked me and never liked caviare,) I went back, regained my
estate, which had trebled its value, and I now stand here, the richest
subject of the Czar, come over to Ängland to show his gratitude to his
preserver.”
I knew that Aunt's historical information would not make her
critical, and I was hardly surprised to hear her say—
“I never heard of this, sir; but your feelings do *. credit.”
“But BRomPtoN-my old friend—makes no allowances for them,
and will accept nothing at my hands,” said his Highness mournfully.
“I have offered him diamonds, roubles, slaves—all in vain. But I have
at last hit upon a scheme, and one which cannot fail.”
... And what may that be, sir?” said poor Aunt.
“I shall make his lovely daughter, here, the PRINCEss Wolga Row-
Kowitch,” said the Prince in a determined voice. “I endow her
with two provinces, one million of peasants, three pints and a half of
diamonds, a mountain of malachite, an ice palace, a menagerie of
bears, and myself. Does the prospect please you, lovely WIoLET, and
will you be content to bloom in the shade of the Uralian mountains f
I pause for a reply.” -
And the Prince took off his hat and fell down on his knees before us.
Before we could make up our minds whether to scream or to run
and while we were perhaps thinking of combining those defences, f
suddenly saw my Brighton riding-master cantering up at the head of
about twenty of his pretty pupils. The cavalry saved us.
The Prince sprang to his feet, and in a respectful, and I may say,
humble voice, said–
“It is time the curtain should fall on the farce; but I will hope for
pardon and approbation from a gracious public. If, ladies, the little
romance, with which I have sought to beguile your hour of leisure, has
afforded you any amusement—my benefit (and he pulled out some
yellow cards) is fixed at the theatre, here, for the 15th. I have a large
and hungry family, and in their names Í would solicit you to take a
few ticket." Shalli appeal in vain?”
“And you are no Prince? and you don't know MR. BROMPTON?”
asked AUNT RATCHET with much indignation.
“I know not which is the greater misfortune,” said the poor actor
“but both are mine. I accidentally overheard your parting, an
Necessity whipped up her child, Invention, to do the rest.”
“But you have a large and . family?”
I knew the woman would go and say that directly, and, moreover,
buy two tickets, like a dear old goose as she is. And I am no better:
for when I saw how thankfully the Prince looked at the half-crowns, I
must make her take two more tickets for the PRINCEss WolgaRow-
KOWITCH.
LINES ON AMALGAMATION.
Two famous Highland “caterans; ”
Were achiefs—or chairmen — of
their clans,
Which—say “MAC NAB,” and
“GREGALACH*—
Were won, to spoil the “Sas-
senac
And when not stealing Lowland
cattle,
Engaged in internecine battle :
There having raged, five hundred
years,
A feud between these mountain-
eers.
They, eaten up with vengeful pride,
Reciprocated homicide;
And, interchanging theft and
arson,
Carried hereditary wars on.
Now Doug AL's dirk pierced
DoNALD's brother;
Then DoNALD went and stabbed
the other:
Now HAMISH stole the sheep or
cow,
Which RodeRick DHU had stolen just now;
Then FERGUs, following on his track,
By force or cunning stole it back;
And Rob and ALLAN would, in turn,
Each other's crazy shieling burn.
These quarrels were a sort of boon
To what was called the “Lowland Loon,”
On whom the robbers could not prey
Whilst they were fighting out a fray.
At last this struck the sharper chief,
Who thus bespoke his rival thief:
“Fat gude's this feud our clans between P
Ou, hawks should na pike out hawk's een;
Let's mak' it up, baith tae and tither,
And gae and raise black mail thegither.”
The leader of the other gang
uick at this sage proposal sprang;
heir bands no more by strife were sundered,
But both together went and plundered.
So has there been, for long, a tussle,
*Twix Clan MAC GLYN and Clan MAC Russell,
Contending line with line of rail, .
Thereby foregoing much “black mail.”
So has ğ. GLyn MAC Russell wooed
To compromise their mutual feud,
And, like those humbugs of the heather,
Put horses—I mean trains—together.
Now should this scheme be * to bear,
How will the British public fare
Fare? why our fare may be as heavy,
On Southron as was Gaelic levy
Collected by the breekless rogues
In tartan kilts and cowskin brogues.
When certain folks fall out, 'tis known,
Some other folks obtain their own;
If Railway Boards combine, ’tis quite
Time honest people should unite.
Walking the Plank.
NAPOLEoN the Great called the throne “a plank covered with
velvet.” NAPOLEoN the Little is at present busy “walking this plank,”
and though he has kept himself up hitherto with wonderful good luck,
still it would be too much for any one to say whether he will be able to
maintain his equilibrium with the same steadiness until he gains his
end. d when he does, who can tell whether, at that yery point, he
may not suddenly fall over and disappear in the “sea of difficulties.”
that, for some time, has been raging underneath him. Far happier to
be PRINCE ALBERT, and “walk the slopes” every morning !“
“No on E KNows when HE's well, OFF.”
So says the popular saying; and it º ſº to a Govern-
ment Steamer, for that is no sooner “off” than it is obliged to come
back again for repairs; and it comes back so often, that not a soul on
board can tell "when he’s well off.”

MELPOMENE, A STAR AT LAST.
As devout worshippers of the lofty and ennoblin
* of the drama of the present hour, we are delighte
to find, on the authority of Astronomer J. R. HIND, that
the new star discovered by him—a star, or planet rather,
“is one of the nearest to us of the group between
MARs and JUPITER, the period of revolution º: 1269
days, which places it between Flora and Victor.I.A.” This
star was discovered on the 24th of June, and its discoverer
solicited the Astronomer Royal to become ius godfather.
By the way, what says the immortal SHAKSPEARE--"the
divine WILLIAMs” of the enthusiastic French—of such
godfathers?
“These earthly godfathers of Heaven's lights,
That give a name to ev'ry shining star,
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than they who walk, and know not what they are.”
. However, the Astronomer Royal has kindly acquiesced
in the wish of MR. HIND, and stood a name—(it is all that
is necessary; planets coming into the world with their own
silver, require no gift of Apostle's spoons or tankards.)
The name is–Melpomene/. There: is not that handsome
to the British drama; that, at last, has a star; a planet,
we mean, that will shine its best of nights without any
salary whatever?
Punch, however, suggests an improvement even upon the
name of Melpomene; and would avail himself of the starry
discovery to prove to America, that the English public do
not º: and crush transatlantic genius. “Unfortu-
nately for me, 1 am an American,” said MR. Buchan AN,
rolling his stage thunder against the Times that said he
might ripen into utility, but was certainly not a full-blown
genius.
Well, as matters are rather ticklish between the coun-
tries, and we may have Edwin For Rest appointed captain
of a bomb-ship commissioned to burn down London and
set the Thames on fire, let us try to conciliate. Punch
therefore suggests that the new planet discovered by an
Englishman, and by our Astronomer Royal (for it seems
there, is a royal, road, to astronomy) named Melpomene,
should be re-christened Susan Cushman And, by the
way, should Punch himself discover another star—provided
the star be no bigger than a brass pin's head—Punch here

SMOKED TO DEATH.
LExANDRE DUMAs says, “It
is to the absence of sup-
pers, and to the universal
F: of the cigar, that
attribute the degenera-
tion of the French esprit.”
It seems to be a curious
recipe for making aperson
spirituel—he must sup,
but not smoke. Accord-
ing to our ALEXANDRE,
one of the tombs of French
wit has been a cigar-box,
and we do not wonder at
it, considering the exe-
crable cigars a Frenchbox
generally contains. They

French wit, at the present

right out of the kingdom. It is for this reason, depend upon it, that French
tobacco is so bad. It is made purposely the worst in Europe, to prevent the
growth of French esprit. The latter is a dangerous insect, known all over the
world for its sting, and so Government takes care to smoke it to death with
Government tobacco.

In consequence of the high opinion which the Proprietors of the

evening, the unparalleled ATTRACTION of the
TERRIFIC ASCENT OF TEN BALLOONs

The number of TEN BALLoons has been determined on, because it is
the general impression that in a single Balloon ascent the CHANCEs
are TEN to ONE in favour of

and the multiplication of ten chances by ten, will heighten the proba-
bility so as to render it almost what may be termed a dead certainty.
In fact, there will be a reasonable hope of several CasualTIEs occurring, Lil
thus affording the charm of variety; whereas a single TUMBLE or

The boy shoeblacks—the infants of the Crystal Palace; the little
ones that remotely owe their DAY (and MARTIN) to SiR, Joseph
Paxton—have had a fête. Cleaning their shoes-like MooRE's young
lady in the Loves of the Angels—
“They moved in light of their own making;"
and took their way, in glad procession through the City, in their red
costume; the blacking brigade's rouge et noir. They bore a standard,
surmounted by two brushes and “a blacking-bottle holding a bunch of
flowers!” ery pretty and very significant this. e brushes
indicating the antagonistic principle to all dirty ways; and the flowers
showing how cheerfulness, and perfume, and beauty, arise naturally
out of cleanliness. - -
The boys—says the reporter—“were well plied with pies and cake.”
We also trust that they had a little beer—nay, frown not, thou man of
temperance, chained to the pump!—of course, we mean the beer-of-
ginger. Innocent pop! -
Any way, the boys were very merry, and very grateful. One shiny-
faced clever lad made a speech: and begged to give the health of
DAY and MARTIN (Drunk, for there was beer, with cheers).
Another speaker, with a somewhat pºetic cast of countenance
begged them to fill their glasses, and—“Try WARREN's "...He said
that MR. WARREN-to whom they all owed so much—had writ a book
called the Lily and the Bee. (Cheers, and cries of “We knows it.”)
And what was very curious, and showed how much their old friend
WARREN, thought of 'em—he (the speaker) had with his own eyes,
while watching the blacking-bottle and the bunch of flowers in the
procession, seen- he would repeat it—with his own ‘. a bee
a big bumble-bee, come and settle upon a lily in the bottle; and
when there, buzz like a good 'un' (Cheers.) He had no doubt on it
in his own mind that that Bee was MR. WARREN's Bee settling on the
ily in his own blacking-bottle (Cheers), which he thought, was very
kind of him. He .# therefore end by giving the health of MR.
WARREN, with hopes that he would, afore he left off, raise a whole
garden of Lilies from the º, and out of his own head let
loose a whole swarm of Bees., (Cheers.)
The meeting then separated.
CARDINAL'S ENGLISH.
A HANDRILL has been sent about, calling itself a “synodical letter.”
of which the authors are, “We, the Archbishop and Bishºps of the
Province of Westminster in provincial synod assembled.” Of this
document the Times newspaper remarks-
“It is written in a kind of theological slang—in a loose and slippery style, which
reads like a bad translation from a foreign language."
True enough. So such compositions always do read. But what
wonder? The framers of them are subjects of QUEEN VICTORIA, who
divide their lawful Sovereign's realm into provinces at the bidding of the
Pope and Pretender. Contemning the QUEEN, her Crown, and dignity,
are they likely to regard HER MAJESTY's vermacular * hat can you

MR. Jukes, in his lecture at the Museum of Practical Geology,
stated—
“Gold-digging is very hard work—just as hard work as you see navigators at in a

The instructions about “lying hard,” are quite unnecessary. Travellers

FIREWORKS FOR THE FRENCH NATION.
MANY dull sensible people want to know what can have put it into
Louis NAPOLEON's head to amuse the Parisian people with fireworks?
Some recollection of Vauxhall, probably, combined with a motion of
turning the Republic of France into a “ #. Property.”
It has been a wonder to the stupid why PREsident Bonaparte
should have treated his subjects—or whatever he calls them—to a
pyrotechnical display, seeing that he has himself so, great an objection
to squibs. But M. BonapaRTE only objects to squibs which fizz at his
own expense.
Considering how deep a purpose has actuated the ruler of the French
nation in playing off his rockets and Roman candles, it is probable that
posterity will pronounce that his fireworks are with a peculiar propriety
called feur d'artifice.

TWO FULL MOONS
IN A MONTH.
GREAT lunar “double event,”
“came off” in the month
of last July, when there were
two full moons. Such an
occurrence, we are told,
scarcely lives in the memory
of the very oldest Almanack.
How many score of years
must pass before it will
again happen, is an astro-
nomical problem which we
have not the courage to cal-
culate. But we think we
can predict a few of the
phenomena which may be
expected to accompany its
remote recurrence. For
instance–
When the Thames has
ceased to be the Main Sewer
of the Metropolis:
When our Agriculturists
have reaped the benefit of
what MR. DISRAELI assures
them is now “looming in
When the Caffres are
“settled,” as well as the
Cape Colonists: -
When the Admiralty can produce a Steamer that will compete in
speed with any ordinary coal-barge : -
When London is at length supplied with pure beer, unadulterated
water, and natural vaccine milk: - -
When there are no longer complaints of “over-crowding” in the
river steamboats and the City streets: -
When we possess a National Gallery that the nation need not blush
to godfather: -
When farmers cease to grumble, and Betting Offices to “bolt:”
When you can find a “quiet street” without a perpetual Promenade
Concert in it: - -
Wºn a racing prophet’s “picks” are no longer simply of tle
pocket:
When the law at length has interfered for the prevention of
Balloonacy:
virtuously re urning a borrowed umbrella:.
When the area of a policeman's duties is no longer confined to that
adjacent to the kitchen: - -
When the most homoeopathic eater can hope to dine twice of a leg
of mutton at any marine lodging-house: - - ---
When at length a process is discoverable by which civility can be
extracted from a cabman: -
And lastly, when either a lawyer or a distressed agriculturist is seen
in the Gazette: -
Then again we may expect to see two full moons in a month—if only
we live long enough.

YOUNG MAN.
No doubt, the dishonest and
ignorant bigots who are in
vain labouring to sustain the
sinking cry of “No Popery,”
will make their most of the
following paragraph, that
lately appeared in the
Times:—
“PERsecution. At Flotarwoe.
(From a Correspondent)—By letters
received from Florence, it appears
that on the 7th instant, the Court
of Cassation rejected the appeal
for a reversal of the sentence pro-
nounced against the MADIA1. It
is generally supposed that this has
been obtained in consequence of
the urgent demands of the Govern-
ment, and with the view of in-
spiring a wholesome fear in the
public mind by an example of
terrible severity. By the sentence
now confirmed, MADAME MADIAI
will be subjected to forty-five
months hard labour at the galleys,
and her husband to fifty-six
nonths, besides having to defray
the whole expenses of the trial;
and it will be remembered that their sole crime has been the abandonment of the
Communion of the Romish Church; and, according to the literal terms of the sentence,
The wretched fanatics who will pervert this story into a case of per-
secution against the Church of Rome are of course stupidly blind to
the glaring fact, that the Roman Church has no more to do with the
Florentine laws and Government than the Sublime Porte has with
Exeter Hall; perhaps not so much as the Church of England has to do
with the punishment of poaching. We will not condescend to prove
an assertion with the grounds of which, of course, all our readers are
familiar. At this time of day, happily, there are few so ill-informed
as to believe in a pretended massacre of the Huguenots on the
authority of an operatic representation at Covent. Garden, or to con-
found the Sicilian Vespers with the Sicilian Mariners' Hymn., Such
zealots, real and rabid, or affected and hypocritical, we must, abandon
to their belief in fabulous bishops, roasted, Strasburg geese-like in the
cuisine of a sanguinary MARY, in minced Albigenses, and in Spanish
auto-dafé, resounding with shrieks of hideous torment, and redolent of
living and human crackling.

of
THE UNITED STATES,
who has kindly consented to give
his countenance to the work.
“WAS THAT THUNDER 9” “NO ! IT WAS ONLY
JULLIEN'S OPERA.”
THERE is no doubt that JULLIEN’s Opera has made a great noise in
the musical world. In fact, so great was the noise, that we determined
upon keeping away. All the reports we heard were those of thunder:
It did not contain an air but what there was thunder in it—and
thunder, too, of the loudest description. JULLIEN, we were told, was a
sort of Jupite R TonANs, who for five hours kept flinging his musical
thunderbolts about in all directions. It was certain deafness for life to
go near him -
The accidents of the Opera, we were informed, had already been
most numerous. The morning after the performance, the ground about
Covent Gardem had been found strewed with dead sparrows. No less
than 1,967 panes of glass had been broken. Every drop of table-beer
in the neighbourhood had been turned sour. The alphabet clock in the
Strand had stopped at D minutes to L; and it was said that the
MARQUIs of W+, as he was passing the theatre about half-past ten
o'clock on the first night, had |. bonnetted by one chimney-pot, and
grazed by several tiles.
And all the above accidents had been attributed to the thunder that
had crashed during the five hours and a half the Opera of Peter the
Great had been raging. Such severe shocks had never been experienced
before. Nor had the effect upon the performers been less disastrous.
TAMBERLIK had lost in the thunder-storm his “unrivalled C. in alt.”
Poor RQMMI's hair in one night had turned completely white. ForMEs
hadn't slept since. Pretty ANNA ZERR, when asked if she could hear
had answered that “she preferred boiled muttons and turnips,” an
serious fears were entertained for the safety of poor JULLIEN himself.
It was gravely reported that, when blindfolded, he was puzzled to tell
the difference between an ophicleide and a Jew's harp.
But we have heard every one of WERDI's Operas. We have
recollections of the Row Polka. We have even heard debates in the
House of Commons. Was it likely, therefore, that the mere chance of
a headache would keep us away from an Opera by such an old favourite
as JULLIEN ? No! we think we should have gone, even in defiance
of the penalty of never having to hear Spooner again.
Preparing for the worst, however, we stuffed our pockets full of wool.
We listened to the First Act, and were charmed. There is a chorus in
it that is as fresh as anything AUBER ever wrote. There is some
dancing music that makes you, long to rush upon the stage, and join in
it. There is a little noise in the act, but not sufficient to wake a child.
We had no cocasion to draw upon the friendly aid of our ear-protector.
The Second, Act contains a little more thunder; but, when we say
that it is loaded full of war—as full as a cannon—perhaps the thundering
accompaniment may not be, in a musical measure, altogether out of
place. Peter has to dictate the plan of his campaign. A series of flutes
are not the best instruments to interpret such a martial subject.
Then he has to address his troops, and urge them on to glory. This
could scarcely be done through the soft medium of a piccolo. After
this follows the Battle of Pultawa. Well, a battle was never won yet
to the inspiriting sound of a penny whistle, and so we must not blame
Jullie N too harshly if he has sent three military brass bands to follow
the Russian army to “Victory or Death.” It is not every battle, like
the Battle of Prague, that is fought on a cottage piano! But, after all,
the thunder is very quiet: what our brothers of Yankees would call
“buttered thunder.” Compared to thunders we have heard in other
operas, it is as soft as one of MARIO's serenades. For instance, it is
as mild as milk, or a cigar, compared to the thunder that kept roaring,
clap after clap (although none of them came from the audience), in M.
HALÉvy's Tempest: we confess that once or twice we were a little
stunned, but still our wool was no more exhausted than our patience.
As for the cannonading, it had better be leſt out. It is not agree:
able to sit in a box, and to imagine every minute a cannon-ball will
come flying into it!
The Third Act breathes a little more quietly. There are love sighs in
it, and tender passages. Occasionally a few black conspirators come and
growl in front of the foot-lights, but they soon go about their business,
murmuring, away behind the scenes; and then Peter and Catherine come
on and make love so musically, that the old dandies in the stalls must
imagine they are wearing their own hair again. After this, follows, a
grand scene in the Kremlin, which, from its splendour, would make the
mouth of an emperor water with envy. If Louis NAPoleon ever
is crowned, he cannot do better than send to Covent Garden, and
borrow the last scene of Peter the Great. It almost dazzles you with
its excess of splendour. You cannot look at it long without shutting
your eyes,
We left the theatre agreeably disappointed. Our stock of wool
was not at all diminished, nor have we been deaf in the least since.
We congratulate Jullie N upon his success, and have some intention of
presenting him with a lightning-conductor, that he can flourish, by way
of a Jovian bâton, in the orchestra. It might draw out the little
thunder there is remaining in his music. That taken away, Peter the
Great would be the best opera produced in England since—since—the
Devil's in it—since we don't know when
HoRRid PRActice.
Louis Napoleon's Campaigns.
As yet they only consist of two—two grand mock battles. The first
was fought last year at the Trocadero, and the second only took place
the other day on the Seine. The Nephew of HIS UNCLE can now
boast of his two victories: one on land and the other on water. He
has thus surpassed his great relative; for it is well known that the
Emperor never was triumphant on the latter!
A BAD THING FOR CONINGsby.
It is rumoured that MR. DiskAELI means to attempt the reduction
of the Three per Cents. to Two-and-a-Half. Should he succeed in this
endeavour, we shall speak of him with diminished interest.
A Doubtful Title.
WE see a little work advertised, called The Art of Dining. There is,
evidently, a flaw in the title here. We cannot allow that there is much
art in simply dining. The author clearly should have written it, T'ie
Art of Dining Out.
PLAYFUL AND true.
...A DistINGUISHED wit, upon hearing that the CoMTE DE CHAMBORD's
title was previously the DUC DE Bordeaux, exclaimed in a minute,
“Then he ought to be called now the CoMTE DE SHAM-Bordeaux.”

EveRYBODY knows that the great obstacle to popular education is
the agreement of sects, on the one hand, that it is necessary to teach
orthodoxy together with secular knowledge, and their inability, on the
other, to agree what doxy is ortho-. In consequence of this coincident
consent and difference, it is vulgarly imagined that the children of the
destitute orders are prevented from obtaining any information what-
ever of a stcular kind. The fact is not so. Many of them are
instructed, and acquire great proficiercy in the very secular sciences of
picking pockets, cattle-stealing, burglary, and even, as the county
magistrate will .. of poaching. They are only prevented from
learning those secular things which, in the opinion y thinking persons,
are the least objectionable, from secular A B C, reading, writing, and
arithmetic, upwards, to an altitude so nearly celestial as Astronomy.
Such being the case, could not the rival denominationists compromise
the education question, having an understanding that orthodoxy shall
be taught as soon as it can be determined, and allowing the secular
alphabet, and so on, to be taught simply, pending the investigation, in
the place of, and as lesser evils than, secular larceny and felony?
Educating themselves in the meanwhile, so as to ascertain the meaning
ºf words, which orthodoxy is a question of, if it,is a definable thing.
Want of dialectics is the cause why theological disputes are not settled,
or why it is not seen that they are interminable. So, in point of fact,
the long and short of the matter is this, that popular ignorance is
owing to clerical nescience, and that the º: remain uneducated
because contending parsons are dunces. And now for a suggestion, by
way of the first step to the combination of spiritual with temporal
studies. Let the children of the people be taught WATTs's hymns,
and the reverend guides of the people Wº: Logic.

CALvimont, Prefect of the Dordogne; of whom the Daily News
writes:—
“This functionary's latest feat was to set up, on the fête of Angust 15, an immense
transparency before the Hotel de Ville at Périgueux, representing an eagle with the
following inscription, “God made Napolvox, and then rested.'"
Punch whistles, and so calls to him this profane dog, and says:-
“CALVIMont, for your beastly impiety receive this sentence: you have
the soul of a spaniel, and for two hours per diem it shall not be per-
mitted to you to walker, ct, but, under penalty of repeated blows, you
shall for two hours per diem for two months crawl on all-fours. You
shall also, for the time, wear a collar, and answer all reasonable calls to

Coldness of the Weather in Paris,
The weather was extremely cold in Paris during the fºes. In fact,
Louis NApoleon could not help observing how coldly the entire
populace looked as he passed with his cortège through the crowded
streets. This is the more strange, as nothing had been left undone to
get up a little warmth on the occasion. We are informed that the
PRINCE PRESIDENT felt this coldness so severely, that he has been heard
to declare that he shall not venture in public again until a very great
change takes place. He has been confined to his room by the cold
ever since.
MORE CRY THAN WOOL.
So many of the much be puffed “Gold Companies” have turned out
such thorough swindles, that we think their most appropriate device

GOLD
IN ENGLAND
THE PRIMROSE-HILL GOLD AND SILVER
MINING COMPANY.
Conducted on the Get-as-much-as-you-can Principle, in
5,000,000 Shares, of 5s, each.
NO LIABILITY TO SHAREHOLDERS.
COMMITTEE OF MANAGEMENT:
The names of the Committee will be published in a few days, and will be
found to comprise some of the most illustrious Captains in the late Spanish
Legion, as well as a large number of Irish M.P.s, ºf the most independent
character. A few Clergymen have also consented to lead their imposing
fict justs.
THE CONSULTING ENGINEER
is at present in Australia, but as soon as he returns, his name will be
announced.
BANKERS:
Directly all the money is paid up, the names of the Bankers will be pub-
lished. Before then, it would evidently be premature, and highly injurious
to the successful carrying out of the Concern.
N.B. The same objection applies to the publication of any other names.

—4–
The great absence of Gold, in England has long been felt to be a
general want. It is the object of this Company to supply that
want.
That Gold exists in large quantities in England is a truth beyond all
doubt. The only difficulty is to know where to find it. The Directors
of this Company pledge themselves not to rest till they have ascertained
that point.
Public rumour has long pointed to Primrose Hill as being a mine of
hidden wealth. The only wonder is, that the mine has never been worked
Deposits have been found there of the richest description.
Pieces of copper as big as a penny have been repeatedly picked up;
and one old man recollects vividly, as if it were only yesterday, his finding
a morceau of gold, which, when washed from #: earthy matter that
surrounded it, weighed not less than a sovereign. This fact proves,
stronger than any evidence, that Gold has been found on Primrose Hill,
and, with a little search, may be found there again.
There is a remarkable peculiarity in the nature or quality of the soil,
which presents strong indications of quartz, being composed partly of
the broken ends of pipes, and partly of fragments of oyster-shells, for it
is an infallible law in nature that wherever pipes and oysters abound,
that is a rich neighbourhood for Quarts.
In fact there is no º until Primrose Hill is fairly worked, what
there may be inside it. For what we know, it may be an immense
money-box, that only requires to be broken open to astonish our eyes
with its long-secreted stores of wealth.
The true locality of “Tom Tiddler's Ground” has never been
ascertained yet...It will not be strange if Primrose Hill should turn out
to be the ground in question, and from the above facts, there is the best
ground for believing that it will. We have been walking over ingots
without knowing it. There has been a fortune lying at London's door,
and for generations we have been doing nothing but kick it away. The
Regent's Canal, at the foot of Primrose Hill, may also be a Pactolus
that is actually running with streams of Gold, and we do not even send
a bucket to help ourselves |
We think we have said enough to prove that there is Gold in England,
and plenty of it. In a few days we shall be ready to commence opera-
tions, and in the meantime the Directors invite with pride the attention
of the public to the following assay on its credulity:-
“This is to certify, that I have examined the sample marked ‘Primrose Hill Gold,
No. 2.' ... I find it contains 7509 per cent... of the purest gold, small traces of silver,
oxide of copper, phosphate of iron, the sublimate of mercury, and several other products
too numerous to mention. “Thomas SnoxEs.”
Future workings of Primrose Hill, however, may afford yet more
astounding revelations of its internal treasures. Something turns up
everyday to justify the most sanguine expectations that an El Dorado has
really been discovered. In the meantime, the motto of the Company is
“OTIUM SINE Dig.”
Applications for Shares to be made immediately to the above addresses,
as a preference will be shown to respectable people.
THE ARCHAEOLOGIST’S PROGRESS FOR 1853,
ºl º \\ /* are happy that we are au-
º
thorised to inform the anx-
ious world of the contem-
Fº investigations of this
earned body for 1853. Hav-
ing successfully traced the
bees'-wing in a bottle of port
at Newark to the bees that
swarmed about the mouth
of PLATo ; and proved that
a ham sandwich—at least
the ham—had come in a
straight line from the Cale-
donian boar, – PROFEssoR
PINCHY, in the course of an
eloquent speech, published
the programme of the society
for the next year.
The learned Professor—
who was much cheered —
said they had been called a
body with less head than
stomach. He would be bold enough to smile at that assertion. Of
course the Society in its corporate form was compelled to eat, like any
other society—he might allude to the Fishmongers; but he wouldn't.
Eating and drinking were the necessities of human nature; and only as
such were considered by the Arclaeologists. Having, however, been so
successful with respect to PLATO's bees and CALEDONIA's boar, they
were stimulated to further exertion: . They would, therefore, next
year, sit upon Dorking fowls—a subject hitherto neglected. They
would also consider the brawn of Canterbury; the bun of Banbury;
the cream of Devonshire; the herrings of Yarmouth; the ducks of
Aylesbury; the sausages of Epping; the toffy of Liverpool; the turtle,
in all its phases, of É. the Sally Lunns of Bath; the salmon of
the silver Severn; and the hams of York, with its awe-inspiring
Cathedral' - -
Here the Professor was interrupted by a burst of enthusiasm. When
it had in some sort subsided, the learned PINCHY said he would not
further dwell upon the comprehensive theme. He would merely add,
that it must be evident from what he had said, from even his imperfect
description of the cºntemplated progress of 1853, that it would, like
the circling horizon, take in everything. . It was his belief, as a man
and an Archaeologist, that such a comprehensive subject as that he had
dwelt upon might be made, with proper time and industry, to begin
with turnip-tops, and end with periwinkles.
t
THE ONLY CURE FOR IRELAND.
PEEvish, fractious, squalling, shrieking Ireland is a child suffering
under protracted teething—certainly having its wise teeth yet to cut.
Always ailing—always breaking out, too—Ireland has not yet had that
salutary eruptive disorder, the measler, which England, had three
hundred years ago. Neither soothing syrup, nor physic of the contrary
sort, will do poor Ireland, any good, till, it has had the measles over;
therefore, they must be brought about for it. The following will be
the only feasible steps to take for º: :—Repeal of the Union
must be granted to the extent of giving Ireland its own Parliament.
Then, by and with the consent of HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN, and not
otherwise, the supreme aut' ority of the Crown, under the name of the
Lord Lieutenancy, is to be delegated to DR. M“HALE, calling himself
Archbishop of Tuam. No attempt is to be made by the English Govern-
ment to hinder the execution o .. laws that may be enacted by the
Papal Irish legislature; only vessels shall be provided to facilitate the
emigration of such Protestants as may wish to get out of the reach
of a statute de haretico comburendo. A few years of unmitigated
priestly rule—of the tyranny of Romish ecclesiastics with power of
confiscation, fire, and ſagot-may be confidently expected to foment
that wholesome exanthem, the desiderated measles-that is to say,
induce an Irish Reſormation: and then, starting from a point in
civilisation corresponding to the age of QUEEN ELIZABETH, regene-
rated Ireland will be enabled to follow the rest of HER MAJESTY's
dominions in the path of progress at the respectful distance of three
centuries behind.

THE “AUGUST INFANT.”
We were a good deal amused the other day by reading in the
Times, that, the blood-royal of Portugal had just produced a little
baby, described in the official bulletin as “the august infant.”. The
announcement set us thinking, and thinking set us writing on this odd
paragraph. .. -
The poor little pink, darling is visible to our parental imagination at
this moment! We feel inclined to dandle it, º say, “Did they call it
an august infant then, and make its papa's subjects laugh? Naughty
minister, would he call it a high and puissant poppet, and make wicked
Punch joke?–Lullaby, darling!”
. But how dare one, yea, even in imagination, dandle the august
infant—the most high and dread baby, in arms? Baby, indeed! This
“young stranger” is no baby. Even while fresh and warm on his nurse's
breast, he has forfeited his claim to the human simplicity of babyhood—
and has become a thing for paragraphs and the foreign correspondent.
Poor child, he must do his “muling and puking” in the Court Circular!
His “birth” is not “a sleep, and a forgetting,” indeed. No; the
“soul that rises with him—his life's star” already claims the title of
august. . To be sure, it scarcely asserts itself yet; but all with due
ceremonious order. At present, it is incog, and waives its native
functions, but it is “august,” of course, all the while.
We can scarcely fancy, by the way, how the dignity attaching to an
august personage preserves itself through the epoch of babyhood. Of
course, the august infant is fed on royal pap, wrapped in imperial long
clothes, protected by an illustrious bib, and sucks a seene thumb. All
this we understand; but, for instance, will the officials comport them.
selves with such reverence as the bulletin happily expresses? Can one
fancy the nurse chirping out, -
“IIush, august baby,
At Portugal's top;
May't please your Highness,
The cradle shall rock?”
We shall be happy, if needſul, to supply properly respectful rhymes
to soothe the awful infancy of this youngster. But wº. to be done,
if he seriously takes to crying for the moon? “Quoi / les rois meurent.
ils 2" said the young French Prince (before the Revolution, of course):
“Quelquefois, #. /* was the courtly reply. But we doubt if
Portuguese courtiers have any such esprit as the French one had; and
when our little august friend does cry for the moon, they will have to
make some absurd and evasive answer—such as that the moon thanks
his Highness, but is detained by indisposition.
The long and short of it, my dear Don JoaçHIM De FLUNKEYo, or
whoeveryou are, is—that you have been a little too pompous and non-
sensical this time! It is always your little states, who do things in this
high-flown and laughable way. . Sense and good-feeling reign in more
important ones. These little ebullitions remind one a good deal too
much of the pages of Tacitus, whose Annals, by the by, comprise a
“Court Circular” of no ordinary interest and instruction.
Moore's Utopia.
Receiving nine thousand pounds a year for being the Registrar of
the Prerogative Court of Canterbury; three thousand.pounds a year
more for being a Canon somewhere; and something like a thousand
pounds a year more for some nice little_rectories in the country;
—making altogether upwards of THIRTEEN THousAND Pounds A YEAR
for doing nothing / That is what we call a very pretty realisation of
“MooRE's UTOPÍA l’”
PARADOX IN POLITICAL ECONOMY.
It is said that the Government contemplate the partial abolition of the
duty on Policies of Assurance. . This measure, if carried,9ut, wi
oddly enough, stimulate a man to insure his life under a diminished
sense of duty. -
Only a Fair Question.
WE take this from the Times:—
“The Chancellon of the Exchequen acknowledges the receipt of the halves of
two notes for £200, on account of a debt long due to the nation.”
This jest has gone quite far enough. As the people have made good
so much to the Exchequer, when will the Exchequer return something,
“on account of a debt long due,” to the people?

RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE,
UNIVERSAL AMALGAMATED.
A GENERAL MEETING of Railway share-
holders was held yesterday at the
Calipash Tavern, to take into con-
sideration a proposal for the
amalgamation of all the Companies,
with a view to putting a stop to
competition between any of them:
MR. SNIGGs in the chair.
The requisition convening the
meeting was then read. It called
briefly but emphatically on all per-
sons whose capital was invested in
Railway undertakings, to combine
for the maintenance and augmenta-
tion of their dividends against an
exacting Public.
The CHAIRMAN moved a resolu-
tion pledging the meeting to devote
its utmost energies to effect that
union, which would render the
holders of lèailway property inde-
pendent, by exempting them from popular control. (Hear.) It was
through competition alone that they were subjected to such slavery.
Where two rival lines existed, the public would naturally prefer
that which excelled in punctuality, expedition, safety, and attendance.
(Hear.) In the contest for ...; each , Company was con-
tinually obliging the other to take on additional hands, engage higher
skill, institute stricter precautions, execute fresh repairs, provide new
machinery-in other words, incur frightful expense for the purpose
of avoiding trivial accidents—which would occur (Hear)—and sacrifice
the highest considerations of profit to foreign requirements of comfort
and convenience (Hear)—which were never satisfied (Hear, hear). In
cases where no direct .# existed, persons travelling merely for
recreation were nevertheless determined in their choice of locality by
the superior attractions of the Railway lines in certain directions. It
was desirable to place all on a level: and, whatever might be thought
of the broad gauge or narrow gauge, to adopt one universal gauge of
accommodation and expenditure, which he was sure all present would
agree, with him—the representatives of the public press (Hisses)
excepted—should be of the very narrowest description (Cheers).
MR. JARyoice hoped to witness the speedy establishment of a
General Railway Conveyance Association for mutual defence. He
should not be satisfied till Railway proprietors enjoyed the same freedom
of action as those of omnibusses and cabs, in not being obliged to
ſurnish a higher class of servants than those gentlemen. Union—
which was strength—would enable them to hire the cheapest engineers,
stokers, porters, they could get (Hear): character and all that humbug
no object. (Hear, hear): and as for guards—why, they might have any
blackguards. (Laughter and cheers.) In fact, they might get most of
their servants for nothing, by allowing them to receive gratuities from
passengers; and he hoped, for his part, to see the day when a gentle-
man or a lady would be followed along the platform by a º touching
his hat (Hear)—yes, and if that wouldn't do, raising his voice—why
not, as well as a common cabman in the street? (Hear) and, at the
same time, they could dispense with the services of policemen altogether.
(Loud cries of Hear.)
MR. SLANGER cordially concurred in the sentiments of the preceding
speaker. He should like also to hear the money-takers at the stations,
when the ſares were tendered to them, say, “What's this?” “What’s
this ere for f"—and so on, like the cabbies, trying to get the passengers
to give more than the authorised demand—the wages of those officials
to consist in the extras thus obtained, which would be a vast saving.
(Hear, hear.) Their clerks and such like cost a deal too much—he
wished to see what he supposed he must call their civil establishment
put on quite a different footing. (Cheers.)
MR. ScrewALL said that the existing competition exercised a most
injurious influence on the construction of second and third-class
carriages, which otherwise might be so arranged as greatly to increase
the resort to the first class. Carriages of the second class might be
lined (Oh, oh!) with hedgehog skins (Hear); and their roofs removed to
let in the wet (Hear, hear); and in third-class carriages they might,
*::::: with passengers, convey pigs. (Much cheering),
R. GRABBINs would remind the meeting of the bundle of sticks in
the fable, and suggested that they should resolve themselves into a
fagot, which would resist the united strength of the newspapers and
the nation. The advantages of combination might briefly be summed
up in maximum fares and minimum outlay; and if they would but put
their engines together, they might go on indefinitely raising the former
and lowering the latter. (Hear.) #. were not there to consider the
Public (Hear), but themselves; still he might observe, that amalgama-
tion would tend to diminish accidents, by enabling them to treat with
total disregard all demands for speed, and leaving them at liberty to
take their own time. ... (Hear, hear.) ft was the pace that killed; and
economy of life and limb was economy in damages—therefore to be
considered. By uniting—by opposing a firm front—a front of brass--
to remonstrance and agitation, they would be empowered to hold their
own (Hear)—and more than their own (Hear, hear)—against all opposi-
tion—take everything coolly-make all things pleasant—and defy cºvery-
body. (Tremendous cheers.)
The resolution having been carried by acclamation, and a vote of
thanks to the CHAIRMAN passed nem, con., the worthy gentlemen
adjourned.
THE MAN WHO OUGHT NOT TO EMIGRATE,
THE man who cannot shave without hot water, or pull off his boots
without a bootjack; the man who cannot get up without a glass of
pale ale in the morning, or go to bed without a “bashawed lobster,” or
devilled bones; the man who has never carried anything heavier than
his cane, or cut *ś stronger than his beard; the man whose only
80wing has been limited to his wild oats, and his only reaping to
Eisen BERG cutting twice a year his corns; the man who has never
handed any other bill but a tailor's, and only knows what a spade is by
seeing it in a pack of cards; the man whose only knowledge of
“hedging” bas been derived from the race-course, and of “harrowing”
from a Victoria melodrama; the man who only cares for a horse as
something to bet upon, and looks upon sheep as “creatures from the
country” that are fleeced at €carte; the man who imagines a bull walks
dn two legs like those he has seen on the Stock Exchange, and whose
skill in shooting has been restricted to a few sho's at the moon; the
man who merely knows a bank and a rake from what he has seen at
a rouge-et-noir table; the man whose footing in society has always been
upon the very best polished leather boots, and whose longest walk in
life has been through the Insolvent Debtor's Court; the man who has
never known what it is to earn a dinner, or to enjoy one without
French wines; the man who would think himself degraded if he was
seen carrying a parcel:—such a man of all others ought not to emigrate.
Better far for him to lounge and loll on sofas, and lisp, and smoke, and
yawn, in a . that can appreciate him, doing no harder work than
digging occasionally in the morning papers, or in the gold districts of
his mother's pocket, than to carry those same qualities to a distant land
where they would only be thrown away, like early purl before quakers.
Such a man, we repeat it, ought to the very last in England to
emigrate |
DEWASTATION FROM THE CLOUDS 1
By the tremendous thunderstorms that occurred some weeks since,
considerable damage had been done to the crops, when a few days of
genial sunshine, opportunely succeeding, reassured the faint heart of
the desponding agriculturist by a promise which, as regards the harvest
generally, has not failed. But in the districts about the metropolis the
hope which spoke thus smilingly to the husbandman has, alas! only
“told a flattering tale.” The showers and thunderbolts had no sooner
ceased to be hurled on their fields of corn from an angry sky, than they
were visited from the same quarter by a plague still more destructive
than cats, dogs, and electric fluid altogether. In the midst of their
ripe ears, now here, now there, always somewhere every evening of
late, down, has come a Balloon: with horse perhaps, and also ass,
attached, the latter riding the former, being biped; or with ass alone,
hº his heels.
The havoc which has resulted has been frightful. A single donkey
would do more than sufficient damage in a wheat-field; but a donkey
appended to a balloon, of course does incalculably more. In addition
to the ravages made by the whole asinine arrangement, there is also the
ruination that has been occasioned by the “Great Attraction” of a
Balloon descending in a populous neighbourhood. One intrepid
aéronaut makes, many of that class of persons, who resemble, the
intrepid sºronaut in the quality which is the basis of his intrepidity;
these all flock together to see him alight, and the consequence is, that
the fruits of guano and industry are trampled beneath the feet of a
concourse of boobies.
Heroes in Blue.
A.100, writing in the Times, animadverts on a report that certain of
the Liverpool Police are to be decorated with medals and bars, accordin
to their length of service. Why not, as well as soldiers? Each o
them who has seen any length of service is the hero of a hundred fights
with hordes of savages infinitely more dangerous than the Caffres: the
ruflians of the Liverpool Irishry; and if the veteran is to be decorated
who fought at Waterloo, surely he deserves at least as great an honour
who has ºl. enemies of whom it may be said that one Irishman
is equal—in ferocity at least—to three Frenchmen.

AWFUL CASE OF SMUGGLING.
From the Hon. Miss —, Maid of Honour on duty, to LADY —, in
the Highlands,
“OH, my dear! You will be shocked to know that the yacht, the
dear Wictoria and Albert, has been caught smuggling! And only to
think, tobacco-filthy tobaccol Fitz, as Captain, is in such a way !
Talked of court-martials and I don't know what; and to be sure it was
enough to put the dear soul in a pucker—(and you know what a good-
tempered creature it always is; and how kind and considerate when the
wind blows!)-but it was enough to vex a saint, if he was post-captain
to have the Custom-house officers board us, and rummage from one en
to the other the Royal yacht. I’m told it was quite shocking; and
that FITz's good-tempered face went blue and red, and pink and yellow,
and all colours like a dying dolphin, to see the coarse, uncivil revenue
men—the º creatures, I call 'em!—rolling about everything in
the cabin, and, as the newspapers this time truly say, “even the
§. private apartments'-tumbling about like porpoises among the
lilows I
“Well, I almost faint to write it, but 80 pounds of filthy tobacco were
absolutely seized on board of us. It’s a wonder that Fitz didn't draw
his regulation sword, and cut of somebody's head—eighty pounds, my
dear; and there was a talk of forfeiting the dear yacht, with all on
board of her. .
. “Smuggling is, no doubt, very bad, and very disloyal under the
circumstances; but to be found out is shocking. But then, how 's it
to be wondered , at? Men, who call themselves the lords of the
creation-men, who know everything—are, I must say it, the merest
babies at smuggling.
“Would you think it, my dear!

anchor was hardly cold in the water of Osborne, before the revenue
officers boarded us, and, began to rummage, I’m told they even
searched Fitz's tin cocked-hat case, but mercifully found nothing in it.
The dear little midshipmen, too, were overhauled—I believe that is the
expression-but came safely through the fiery furnace. But when the
The foolish fellows—I mean the
UEEN's Customs in England, telling'em how Her MAJESTY
officers at last ſell, upon the tobacco–eighty pounds of tobacco–dear
Fitz was in such a way that he said—in very strong language—
he'd run somebody up at the fore-yard; which happily he didn't.
“However, there's to be a court-martial on board the Victory; and
we are all, without any reserve whatever, to be examined. Of course
this can't affect the innocent; nevertheless it is vexing; although,
between ourselves, his dear little R–1. H-GH--s has had a joke upon
it. “Pa,” said he, seeing the P-E about to light a cigar—“Pa,” said
the sweet little fellow, "have you º: Mamma's duty for that ?”
Wasn't that good P. Well, I won't tell you who laughed the loudest;
but though vexed she did laugh. -
“Still, the discovery is annoying, because—because it might have been
prevented. But to smuggle in such an open, audacious, sinful, and
disloyal manner | | When of course every motion of the gallant crew is
watched ashore! To buy five thousand pounds of tobacco–as much as
that, my dear, I’m told; quite—in open day. What could be expected?
But men are such simpletons! -
“Now, my deat, let us suppose that instead of nasty tobacco bought
at Antwerp it had been some darling Brussels lace; and suppose that
somebody that both you and I know had only wished for a little
Mechlin point—I do think that the purchase would have been made
with a reserve that would have proved how much we respected the
yacht of our royal mistress; but men—I am sorry to be compelled to
write it—men have no delicacy. -
“Well, I do envy you in the Highlands; but it is always my luck.
We've had such weather. They tell me, though I was too ill to see
'em, they tell me it blew great guns. Any way we heard 'em! Between
ourselves, I was a couple of days before I could hear myself speak—
isn't that dreadful? But we were fired at—they call it saluting—from
Osborne to Antwerp, and from Antwerp to Osborne back again. Had
we all been shot out of guns, we couldn't have felt more of the noise
and the smother. I never was in all my days so powdered!
“Good bye, Yours affectionately,
“P.S. Between ourselves, it was lucky I got ashore before the Custom
house officers began their search. I won't tell you how very much it
would have annoyed me to witness their insolence. But on all tha',
for the present, I’ll drop a veil.”

MISS VIOLET AND HER “OFFERS.”

CHAPTER XVII.
I CERTAINLY will persuade my dear AUNTY RAtchet to go out to
the Diggings, before she gets me into any more disagreeablenesses.
Those Gittingses again f. that everything has its use in the
order of nature, but I do not understand what Gittingses are for.
Papa sent us into the City, in the brougham, that we might leave
some papers, which he said were important, at the Fireside and Circum-
navigating Life Assurance Office. Having left them, Aunty must needs
go to BIRCH's for a “warm jelly,” which she has an old world convic-
tion can be got nowhere else in London. While she was enjoying her
jelly (which I thought was a little out of season on a hot day in August),
I was amused at seeing dreadfully stern old men, F. huge, Scotch
merchants, keen-eyed stock-brokers, and all kindso pushing and over-
bearing people, perpetually cºming in and darting at penny tarts, like
school f and looking greedily at what others were eating.
"Weiſ irii be flopjisticated,” cried a loud, laughing voice behind
me. "And I, and indeed everybody in the shop, turned to see what sort
of an operation was going to be performed. To my dismay, a little
round red man, in a blue coat and brass buttons, and such a flaming
waistcoat, pushed his way up to Aunty.
“MRs. RATCHET come into the City again! Wonders will never
cease.” And he added something about a sight of Aunt being service-
able in an opthalmia case.
“Luckiest chance in the world,” he went on. “I'd 'a given a tenner
rather than not have looked in here. You know the gal's married, our
MEg—spliced to SAM Point P”
th .# Violet, my dear,” said Aunt, looking at me, “Do you hear
a xx
“O, this is Violet my dear, is it?” said the gentleman, who of course
was MR. GITTINGs of Rotherhithe. “I’ve heard of Miss WIolet,
rather,” and he looked elaborately sly. “So have some other folks—a
certain crow was plucked a good many times with Master SAM, I can
tell you. Tried to take the wind out of MEG's sails a little, eh? Well,
all fair among girls—no harm done—she only laughs at it now.”
I, I, Violet BRompton—accused of trying to supplant Miss
MARGARET GITTINgs in the affections of MR. Šº. É. Was
not I a good girl not to flash my eyes at him, but to answer civilly, and
indeed laughing, that there was some little mistake and that I was
sincerely glad to hear that the wedding had taken place Was I not
a good girl, I keep asking?
“Well, that's said very kindly, and I am sure sincerely,” answered
MR. Gittings. “And to show it is sincere, we'll all go up and see
Meg. . It's close by, in a street just out of Finsbury Circus. I know
she's in, and she'll take it deuced kind.”
“I should like to see her now she's settled,” said dear Aunty,
who has all an old...woman's funny hankering to examine a young
* menage. What was I to say? We went to pay the wedding
Visit,
We found Mrs. SAM Point in a comfortable lit'le house, in which
everything looked new and showy, ant as the blinds were drawn up to
the very top, and the curtains pulled back almost into ropes, we had
the full sunlight upon each article. But MARGARET’s red cheeks defied
the sunshine, and she looked as petulant and self-willed as ever. Stiff,
cheap portraits of M.R. and MRs. Point (he in the celebrated red cravat,
and she in red satin, with two colossal brooches) already stared from
the wall. She received me very graciously—I really believe she thought
that there had been a lutte, and that she was victor. Wine and cake
were handed and Aunty lºachet made a little set speech, wishing the
young couple (M.R. SAM was absent) “all the happiness they could wish
for themselves.” And, as it seemed to be expected, I ventured a humble
echo of Aunty.
“Bears no malice, you see, Mr.G.,” said the abominable MR. GITTINGs.
I was not so sure of the fact, at that moment.
Several people came in, and they were all introduced to us. Three
or four girls, rather pretty, were among them, but they were difficult
to talk to, being a little clique, and when one made the commonest
observation, they would look at one another, and laugh, as if one's
words reminded them of some secret joke. And they talked a good
deal among themselves about certain Toms and Johns, and were
generally mysterious. At last, MR. FERDINAND Swink was announced,
and his name created a sensation. Miss JARvis (1 think) seized Miss
Bow KER (lithink) by the arm, squeezed her, and made a face like that
of a child when it intends to denote extreme ecstacy.
“Clever young man, pleasing writer, very superior person,” said one
of the elder ladies. >
“Not a bit,” cried Miss JARvis, “he’s good for nothing. Now FER-
DINAND,” she exclaimed, as the gentleman entered, “I have been abusing
you, so come and sit on this footstool by me, and defend yourself.”
“Worth while, I should say, considering my assailant,” returned
MR. sºilº He looked hard at me as a new member of the
circle, and then at MRs. SAMUEL for an introduction. But she did not
respond. I ſancied I saw one of the girls make a sign to her not to do
so. MR. Swink, however—rather a good-looking person, over-dressed,
and with a familiar manner, which I suppose passes in his world for
careless ease—was not to be discomfited.
“I like to know everybody, MRs. Point. Will you introduce me?”
“MR. SwiNK, Miss Baoxipton,” said MARGARET, with the worst
grace in the world.
“Magic words,” said MR. Swink, dropping himself heavily upon the
sofa close by me, and leaning himself back. “The Open Sesame of
society. Now, girls, what have you got to say to amuse me?”
“Well, I never !” said Miss JARvis. “Why don't you amuse us?
What have you been writing lately, you idle creature?”
“Nothing you would understand,” replied the courteous author.
“A great writer, that, next you, Miss Violet,” said MR. GITTINGs.
“Indeed,” I said, with great politeness. “May I ask in what
department-"
"There,” snapped Miss JARVIs, “you see, Miss BROMPTON has never
even heard of your name. I always told you that you never wrote,
except for rubbishing magazines that nobody reads.”
The author looked so sincerely annoyed at this smart sally, that I
determined to relieve him.
“So many of our best writers are anonymous,” I suggested;
“newspapers and periodicals employing so much talent, that one
may be ignorant of the name of an author to whom one is constantly
indebted.”
“Just so,” said, MR. Swink, catching at the idea. “And,” he
added, confidentially, “one does not always think it necessary to
mention everything one does.”
“O, of course,” said Miss JARVIs, “now that notion is put into his
head, he will go about hinting that be writes the whole of the Times
every morning before breakfast.”
This style of repartee seemed popular, and we had a good deal more
of it. But at last MR. Swink, who listened very attentively to the
little I said—they fought too hard for me—appeared to discover, for
the first time in his life, that there must be circles in which people
can talk without snapping at one another's words, and “catching one
another up.” He made not the slightest scruple of affording his friends
the benefit of his discovery, and by no means softened the mode of
conveying it.
“By Jove" he said, when Miss JARwis had given him what the
other young ladies called a regular set down. “What a blessing it is to
hear somebody sneak without trying to be witty. Miss BRompton,

you girls in all your lives.” -
“There's praise for º: Miss WIOLET,” said MR. GiTTINGs. “You
ought to be proud of that.”
J “The new face always has him. We know him,” remarked Miss
ARWIS.
“You talk disgusting nonsense,” replied the author, getting very
red, and quite forgetting any good manners he might ever have had.
The girls quite screamed.
“There’s earnestness,” cried Miss BowkER... “The young lady has
made an impression, that's clear; and had better prepare herself for
the worst.”
“She might do much worse than listen to º friend Swink,” said
the premature. MR. Gittings. ... I suppose, he thought he owed me a
helping hand, in consequence of my losing M.R. Point to MARGARet,
“See how he colours up !” cried Miss JARvis. “Why not make
the offer at once, FERDIN AND” So famous a man as you has only to
ask. What do you say, MRs. Point?”
“I dare say Miss Violet will give him every encouragement,” said
MARGARET, spitefully.
“What does Miss Brompton say to that ?” asked MR. FERDI-
“O, Miss BROMPTON means to take very good care whom she
encourages—for the future,” was that young lady's reply, given with a
smile, and the least look in the world at MRs. SAMUEL Point. She was
lin º order for takini. the slightest hint, and her red cheeks in-
stantly lighted up with a brilliant illumination.
“Before people talk of i. she sniffed out, “they should
be sure that other people desire anything of the sort.”
“You used the word first, MRs. PoſNT,” said the author, who began
to take a tender interest in me, and would not see me ill-treated.
“I suppose I am at liberty to use any word I please,” returned Mrs.
MARGARET, “without being responsible to M.R. FERDINAND Swink?”
In short, that little speech of mine—and really I think she drew it
on herself-made MRs. SAMUEL so fierce, that the séance became quite
uncomfortable; and I was so glad when Aunty was quite satisfied with
the immense amount of information she had elicited from the married
ladies about their children's teethings, forwardness, fat legs, hooping-
ºft. and willingness to take grey powders. What in the world was
it all to that tiresome old creature ?
MR. Swink sent me, for a long time, cuttings of country newspapers,
pages from magazines, and º: of his genius, but I never
took any notice of them; and ly he discontinued the practice, and
married Miss JARvis.
NAND, I really believe a great deal more in earnest than in joke.
THE MANCHESTER CRUSADE.
UNCH is glad to see that
Manchester is astir again.
Manchester has begun a new
Crusade. The objec', of this
Manchester New Crusade is
to throw open to all manner of
poor pilgrims the Holy Land
of Knowledge.
It is expected that an enor-
mous number of captives,
enslaved by drunkenness, fe-
rocity, pauperism, and other
evils, will be delivered by the
efforts of the Manchester
Crusaders. That distressed
damsels, now, shirt-making in
garrets, or elsewhere slaving
on miserable terms, will be
rescued or succoured to an
immense extent. And that
the MAhoun D of Darkness and
TERMAGAUNT of Ignorance
will be discomfited: so that

the one “denomination” of bigot, charged by our Manchester chivalry with
durance, particularl

bite the dust. --
More than one GoDFREy—we may venture to say, of BULLION, at least of what
amounts to the same thing, opulence—several wealthy gentlemen, in short-have
placed themselves in the van of the expedition, by contributing to the funds thereof
in the handsomest manner. The Crusade, moreover, has—what is wonderful in
these days, especially when you consider what a Crusade it is—a real prelate among
its preachers—Manchester's Bishop. - -
This Crusade has commenced in a rather different manner from that in which
PETER the Hermit got up his. Its promoters do not go about flourishing crosses
and banners, ranting, raving, collecting mobs, and causing obstructions in the
street, but they meet in well-ordered assemblies, speechify with gentle enthusiasm,
draw forth no swords, but simply their purses; flourish no weapons, but, those
of good stump oratory. However, their zeal will bear a comparison with that of
Peter's most ardent recruits; and its contagion, indeed, has extended tº the softer
sex, who attend their gatherings, lend the inspiring aid of looks and smiles to their
design, and, in some cases, even give it the help of subscriptions.
The Manchester New Crusaders broke ground on Thursday last by the opening
of an entrenchment against. Ignorance, to be called the Manchester Free Library,
whence a continued fire will be kept up upon the enemy in vollies of volumes
fººl. distributed by loan; or, if he prefer coming to close quarters, where
e will be received by a fixed array of authors of tried prowess, who will astonish
and enlighten his weak mind.
. An indulgence in the brightest anticipations is granted to all persons who will
join or assist the Manchester New Crusade against Ignorance.

What 'tis that so inflames your ire

And drives you to evince such dire
Exasperation.
It is that we, my priestly boy,
Such cool and temperate means employ
To check your pinions,
So that your Pope shall not enjoy
The QUEEN’s dominions.
You’re vex'd, because you want a cry

With resolution;
And you can't goad us–though you try-

The 50,000 Cures.
In the advertisements of some quack medicine—no matter
how deleterious, how poisonous – the marvels that are
related of its wonderful effects are always headed with
the above number of cures. The number is always 50,000
—not one more, not one less. The wonder is, not that
they are so numerous, for if the statement had been put
at 500,000, or 5,000,000, we should have no means of
#.; the truth of it; but that the Cures have not
increased by a single unit for the last three or four years.
This is curious; but we can only infer, that during that
riod the medicine has not worked a single cure, or else
it would have been added to the amount i. recorded.
It is not often one meets with so much honesty in a quack
advertisement

(A Column erected to all matters relating to Debt.)
It is very strange there are some creditors
who are always unlucky — they always call a day
too late | If they had but called yesterday, they
might have had their money.
There are many men, who, as they pay one
debt, invariably contract another—in the same way
that tinkers never patch up a hole in a kettle,
without leaving another one behind it.
One of the French words for a bill is Mémoire.
This title of Mémoire, however, would suit many
dishonest tradesmen, who, not content with collect-
ing a debt once, actually try to re-collect it.
The ancients raised pyramids; in the Middle
Ages our ancestors raised cathedrals; but in modern
times it would be difficult to say what we raise,
unless it is the wind.
If States were made to answer for their debts in
the same way as private individuals, there’s many
a kingdom that would be in the Insolvent Debtors'
Court at the present moment,
A man begins finding out faults that he was
blind to before he borrowed your money.
We are often asked, “What's in friendship
but a name ** Yes, but it’s a name that friend.
ship is frequently called upon to put on the back
of a bill.
A bill is described in dictionaries as “A
sharp instrument, with a wooden handle.” The
sharp instrument, we suppose, is the man who
cuts off with the money, and the “wooden handle,”
we slightly imagine, is the man who holds the
bill.
In fashionable life, the men most run after are
the men deepest in debt.
Debts grow the fastest, like artificial mushrooms,
when kept quite dark; and this is the reason
why tradesmen will never send in their bills.
The French word for a receipt is reconnaissance.
There's deep satire in this word—satire fully
accounting for the little gratitude there is to be
met with in this world!
The house in the street at whose door you hear
the most knocks, is generally the house that owes
the most.
England is bound down so heavily to keep the
peace, that she cannot afford to recover the
payment of her just debts.
The man who has mortgaged all his property
is a slave who walks about in Bonds.
If a gentleman refuses to repay what he has
borrowed, it is called Swindling; but if a State
refuses the same thing, it is called “Repudiation.”
A man can often tell you how much he has,
when he would be terribly puzzled to tell you how
much he owes.
The Money Market is occasionally cleaned out,
when a little whitewash makes it all sweet again.
The abundance of chalk in England's cliffs for-
tunately enables her to write up the many loans and
debts that are owing to her by Chili, Mexico,
Spain, Columbia, Peru, Portugal, and almost every
insolvent State (not forgetting the State of Penn-
sylvania) in the world.
In modern mythology, the Three Graces are
L. S. D.—the Three Furies, I. O. U.
A poor creditor calls the Duke of York's statue
“The Statute of Limitations,” for ever since it
has been erected, it seems to have entirely cancelled
his debts. -
Credit is one great advantage which the rich have
over the poor, for running into debt.
One of the slang words for money is “ready,”
but there is a very wide difference, as creditors can
tell you, between “ready” and “ready money.”
A Mortgage-deed sounds quite grand; but it is
nothing more than a Duplicate.
--
Patience is described as “sitting upon a monu-
ment, smiling at grief.” The monument, then,
should be one like the Duke of York's, and she
should be smiling at the “grief” of the creditors
waiting below to be paid.
The DUKE of York's principal military exploit
was a rapid retreat, in which the greater part
of the British Army was left behind. This was
not the only honourable instance of his leaving
thousands in a-rear; and we suppose the Column
in Waterloo Place was erected to commemorate
the double event.
The Bull in the Sky.
The last flight of aeronautical folly—according to a letter in the
Times—was that of MADAME Poitevin astride on a Bull. It has been
suggested that the Bull thus elevated into the sky, might have been
confounded by some observers with the original *::::. the sign of
the Zodiac; but no, MADAME Poitevin's Bull figuring in the heavens,
çould not possibly have been mistaken for any sign but the sign of the
folly of the rider, and her admirers.
SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.
THE Koh-i-noor is still continuing its quiet little rubber with the
gentlemen from Amsterdam. The finish is not yet known, but the game
is said to depend now upon one point merely—whether the Koh-i-moor
at the next cut turns up a Diamond or not. There is more than a
million dependant upon the result.
Curious Experiment.
Two French chemists have been trying experiments with the poison
of the toad. It would be interesting to send them DR. CAHILL's
letter to LoRD DERBY, to see what amount of poison they could
extract from it, and how virulent it would be... We have no doubt that
if a drop of it was put on a sparrow (a Protestant sparrow), that it
would die instantaneously.

PEARLS OF THE PREROGATIVE COURT.
To the Editor of PUNCH.
ºt

“Your known love of fair play will, I am sure, allow me to
deprecate the very indelicate details which have lately been }.
in reference to the income of the REveREND MR. MooRe, the Registrar
of the Prerogative Court, and the holder of diversified preferment in
the Church. We all sufficiently know the value of this gentleman; and
I am convinced that his modesty must have been severely pained by all
those public demonstrations of his great worth. I beg more particularly
to offer a reply to one of the statements made by a writer in the
Times, signing himself “MEMoR.” MR. MooRE is stated by this
extremely explicit person to have occupied, for the last, forty-eight
years, a stall in Canterbury cathedral, of the value of £1,000 a year; so
that, during the above period, he has thus received £48,000. MEMOR
—whom in point of refinement I should rather term IMMEMOR-then
enters into a rough, indeed, a coarse, calculation, to the effect that
MR. MookE has, in the course of his life, preached about 4 times 48,
or 48 times 4, sermons, for the last-mentioned sum. Now, 4 times 48
sermons are 192; and 192 sermons at £48,000 are £250 per sermon.
Of course it is the vulgar intention of MEMOR to insinuate that this
figure is too high—that MR. MooRE has, in fact, been receiving very
much for doing very little. But, Sir, what if a totally different aspect
of the case be the correct view How, if each of MR. MooRE's
sermons were really worth £250, payable on delivery P Surely, when
we consider the high remuneration accorded to an opera-singer for a
single performance, and the relative importance of the stage and the
pulpit, we must admit that a sermon deserves a liberal pecuniary
reward, if it deserves any. Now I, for my own part, would venture to
infer from the circumstances just adverted to, that MR. MooRE is a
gentleman of extraordinary self-denial. He has been preaching
sermons to the number of 192, which, merely to hear, were worth £250
a-piece; yet he has never published these valuable discourses!
“The profits that would have accrued to him from their sale would
have been enormous—nevertheless he has foregone a safe and legitimate
speculation that would have enriched him to an extent beyond the
º:
dreams of HUDson 1 For the sake of mankind, however, I must conſess
that he ought no ºf; to withhold from us these precious homilies,
which, flowing from his lips at the rate of £250 each, must have abso-
lu'ely gilt them : rendered him positively a modern GoI.DMoUTH or
Chrysostom. At a moderate computation, a sermon at £250 might be
valued at about eightpence the spoken word : such words, copyright, in
type, are gems, and might be issue i from the press under the title of
“Pearls of Great Price.” Unless the pearls should prove to have been
cast before swine, their proceeds would enable the author to endow
several colonial bishoprics, and build an indefinite number of churches
and schools.
“It may be urged that four sermons in a year are not many; but
when it is remembered that their value is 1000l., it will be admitted
that they ought to go a great way, and that a larger number of such
rich discourses might have been too much of a good thing. .
“In conclusion, Sir, let me observe that perpetual allusions to MR.
MooRE's opulence may very possibly entail unpleasant consequences on
him. They have already procured him, the world-wide reputation of
inhabiting an Ophir, a California, a Garden of the Hesperides. In the
not improbable event of a French invasion, the first place the enemy
would go to plunder might be the Bank; but the next would certainly
be—MR. MooRE's

“PHILO-PROBATE.”
A Defence for the Derbyites.
THE Ministers have postponed the meeting of Parliament to the
remotest period. As no plausible reason has been offered for this
proceeding, we beg, to suggest that the Government, in postponing
the assembly of Parliament, may be actuated by the feeling that, as the
harvest has been rather late, the thrashing—which is inevitable—may
as well be put off as long as possible.

IT will soon become a question what to do with the Union Work-

agricultural labourers, generally, get paid at the rate of 3s.6d. a day
and a gallon of beer. These institutions—these, at any rate—seem
likely to be ruined by Free Trade.
They had better, perhaps, be converted into Assembly Rooms,
because, though the returning days of Merry England in the olden
time will bring back Maypoles, yet Maypoles, in a changeful climate
will not afford those facilities for merrymaking which will be required

Who Wants Whiskers P
In an advertisement commencing with the tender inquiry, “Do you
want luxuriant hair!” we find the following testimonial:—
“I have now a full pair of whiskers. Send me another pot. MAJon HUTTox.”
What! another pot of whiskers? Now, we have heard of Potted
, and several other luxuries that are potted, but we never recollect
hearing of Potted Whiskers!
the RESULT OF GOOD LIVING.
WE wonder MR. MooRE is not afraid of holding so many good
livings, lest he should die some fine morning of pluracy.
SEA-SIDE AIRS.
(As shown by Young Gentlemen at a Watering-place.)
WEARING hats and coats they would never think of wearing in
London.
Sporting their elegant feet in buff-coloured, slippers, or bottines, or
pearl-buttoned boots, or shoes of the most dazzling colours, such as
would draw all the little boys after them in town.
Affecting a nautical appearance altogether, carrying a long, telescope
under their arm, which every now and then they pose against the parapet
to take a sight at some invisible object “in the offing.”
Affecting a nautical language, also, so as to impress any one with the
motion that they had a whole fleet of yachts under their command,
and talking of young ladies as if they were ships, such as—“She's a fine
young craſt,” and “By H’v'ns ! in steering for the pastrycook's, she's
run foul of the old gentleman.”
In short, making their appearance as “ship-shape” as possible, and
their conversation also, taking “My Poll and my Partner Joe” as the
nautical model of the latter.
Smoking cigars along the pier, up and down the Parade, before
breakfast and before dinner, night as well as day, smoking all day long
—everywhere.
Hanging about the sands under the pretence of reading a book, and
always occupying three chairs when they sit down—one for their body,
one for their legs, and another for their feet—with another one for
their telescope.
Walking, swaggering, as if the whole place belonged to them—
staring every one out of countenance—talking loudly, as if they were in
a ſashionable box at the Opera—and swinging their bodies about, just
as if it was necessary to imitate the rolling of a ship because they were
at the sea-side.
Supposing they are accompanied by a big dog, the terror of the
nursery-maids and the children, all the better. Supposing the dog is
fond of the water, and emulates his master in creating a great splash
amongst the young ladies, all the better still.
And when the young gentlemen return to their desks, or their
mothers' apron-strings, in town, they are so meek and orderly, and
walk the streets with such boarding-school modesty and precision, that
no one would suspect for a moment they were the same rough, noisy,
Newfoundlandish, splashy fellows that were bounding about in all
directions at the sea-side,
A TOUR QUITE ABROAD.
Excursionists who want to have enough—and more than enough—
for their money, cannot do better than take a return ticket for Paris,
viá Newhaven and Dieppe, at the Brighton terminus. They will have
an opportunity of making a much longer stay at Dieppe than the strict
letter of the bargain provides; and the probability is that they will be
enabled to enjoy the delight of a bivouac on the beach, by the absence
of a steamer at the appointed time, and by the impossibility of gettin
a bed at Dieppe. Should there be one at liberty, the excursionist j
have the means of acquiring a knowledge of the manners, or want of
manners, of the natives, and of learning—through the lessons of that
first-rate instructor, experience—the extortionate habits of the hotel-
keepers. Those who wish to study French character at Dieppe, with
the addition of a series of surprises at not finding what they were led
to expect, which forms one of the chief charms of travel, will do well to
adopt the tour we have recommended them.
The “Row.” Opera.
JULLIEN's Qpera, though not without much to praise, would have
made a great deal more noise in the world if there had been less noise
in the orchestra. His attempt to realise a battle and the roaring of
artillery by means of music, brought him into collision with what may
be termed the musical cannons. There is no doubt, however, that
the next effort of the Mons. will be more successful; for it is in the
nature of every Mons. to ascend, and he will know better next
time than to “seek the bubble reputation” so directly as he has
done, “in the cannon's mouth.” The reason assigned by the
friends of JULLIEN for his excessive use of the noisiest instruments
of the orchestra, in his late opera, is a desire on the part of the
Mons. to prove himself a sound musician.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A GREAT BABY CASE.
T all times Punch delights to meet in
the Times the letters “S. G. O.”
There they are, the letters signifying
Wºº work-work—work: and always noble
ſº work: work, that is to pick up poor
T º humanity out of the mud it may crawl
º º W or be crushed in: work that lays hold
º *WW of selfishness by the collar, and strives
º to give it a º shaking, quickening its
pulses, and opening its
eyes: work that gives its
strong right arm to timid
pining misfortune, an
strives to bring it into
broad, healthy daylight
that it may be seen, an
seen, sympathised with,
and comforted. Well,
S. G. O. has now taken
the babies of England
—not all of them, but
many thousand, cheated,
defrauded babies—under
his pen feathers, doing
his É. to have them
righted. He constitutes
himself Chancellor pro-
tective of babes, cheated
* of their own milk: the
milk that they bring with
them; the milk that, for
a certain price, is sold in Portman Square and Belgravia.
“I do not know,” says S. G. O
“I do not know which to rate highest, the cruelty or the immorality to which the
wet-nurse system offers so liberal a premium. Ladies have no shame, show no
reluctance in hiring the service of ‘a healthy young single woman' to give to their
infant the food they refuse it, and which she must take from her own."
And the Registrar-General shows that the defrauded suckling
generally dies' Thus, poor little, Turnham-Green is sacrificed, to
Belgravia; weak, puny little Peckham is offered up to May Fair.
“Usually,” says the Registrar-General, “in about four or five months
death occurs, literally and truly for the want of nature's own nutriment
—breast-milk.” The milk sold to four months' old Marquis—to
suckling Earl'
Well, S. G. O. admits that a baby may be a “bore:” a very great
“bore” indeed, if arriving in the world early in the fashionable season.
And nursing, he thinks, may spoil a figure; and, moreover, absolutely
make a jº look like a mother—not at all an agreeable reflection,
you know, in LADY Rosa's looking-glass.
“I will not for a moment dispute but that it would “annoy HENRY to have the
nurse shuffling in with baby at all hours of the night;" still, allowing to wealth and
high-breeding, fashionable refinement, &c., every protection their vested interests
demand, I must yet question whether LADY BELLA's season's enjoyment, her
husband HENRY's unbroken after-House of-Commons sleep, the preservation of her
girlish figure, are worth the moral cost of a premium to immorality, or the cruel cost
of death to the infant whose mother's milk has been bought away from it.”
All this is very strong; and S. G. O. continues, becoming almost
vehement in his indignation at the immorality of the high lady who
will buy the milk of “nice tidy MARY”—it may be a “fallen’ MARY
—but then the fall has been so pathetically accounted for—that it were
scarcely so much a fall as a trip or slip. And MARY for a while lives
well and reposes, like a jewel, in velvet; until the little lord is weaned,
and then the world is all before her, and she may “sin again.” But
all wet-nurses are not of these. Many are married women:
“So they are; and the father has to see his own child waste, or for pay receive a
bastard's food, because his own or wife's poverty has forced him and her to barter
their own infant's proper nourishment, that some high-bred or wealthy mother may
save her figure or enjoy her season of gaiety.”
These be bitter words; but like bitter aloes, they are true things.
And is there no remedy for this P. Shall May Fair continue to have its
Moloch Shall mother's milk—like milk of asses—be still vendible at
great houses? No; we espy a very probable remedy.
A time may come when the Morning Post shall rejoicingly announce
that the most illustrious wife and highest mother in the #d is about
to have even the fullness of her domestic happiness increased ; and
further that the Post is almost authorised to state that—“No Wet
Nurse need apply.”
Now this one fact, with all the force of strongest example, would
almost stop the sale of mother's milk in high places. Never mind the
calls of daily duty and daily ceremony; it matters not that a Drawing-
room is to be held—that the EARL of DERby is to be honoured with
an interview—that a State dinner is to be given—that UNCLE Leopold

This is the example that is needed in high life. Without it great
babies will continue to fatten on the natural property of mean ones;
and the suckling Earl of Piccadilly cheat little Whitechapel, that
after a due course of “convulsions, dysentery, marasmus,” &c., goes off
in about four or five months “for the want of nature's nutriment—

(Being a slight liberty taken with “The Bride of Abydos.”)
Know ye the stream where the cesspool and sewer
Are emptied of all their foul slushes and slimes,
Where the ſeculent tide of rich liquid manure
Now sickens the City, now maddens the Times?
Know ye the filth of that great open sink,
Which no filter can sweeten, no “navvy” can drink :
Where in boats overcrowded the Cockney is borne
To the mud-bounded gardens of joyous Cremorne:
Where the gas-works rain down the blackest of soot,
And the oath of the coalwhipper never is mute:
Where the liquified mud which as “water” we buy,
With the richest of pea-soup in cºlour may vie,
And deodorisation completely defy:

And the banks teem prolific with corpses canine P

Oh! fouler than words can in decency tell

“THE DEVOURING ELEMENT.”
Penny-A-LINERs have long been in the habit of calling fire “the
Devouring Element; ” but the fire will soon be put out, we think, by
Steam. Only look at the accidents on the American steam-boats, and the
daily accidents that occur on our beautifully-managed railways—all
caused by Steam | We hope, therefore, for the future, that when
penny-a-liners are describing any casualty of the above sort, they will
always allude to Steam as being “The Devouring Element.” Con-

to it the “devouring” superiority. Henceforth, let it be j

“MR. PUNch, SIR,-Bound with a few friends on a short pleasure ex-

consequence of having misunderstood BRADshAw we got to the station
half an hour too soon, and not knowing how we could more appro-

And we’ll by rail repair
Unto the Nell at Dedmanton,
And take a breath of air.
“My sister takes our eldest child;
The youngest of our three
Will go in arms, and so the ride
Won't so expensive be.”
JoHN soon replied, “I don’t admire
That railway, l, for one;
But you know best, my dearest dear,
And so it must be done.
“I, as a linendraper bold,
Will bear myself, and though
'Tis Friday by the calendar,
For half an hour they there were stay’d,
And when they did -
“No train! A hoax!” cried clerks, agog
To swear through thick and thin.
“Yaal” went the throats; stamp went the
Were never folks so mad,
The disappointment dire beneath;
ied it was too bad!
John GILPIN home would fain have hied,
But he must needs remain,
Commanded by his wilful hride,
And take the usual train.
'Twas long before our passengers
Another train could *:
When—stop ! one ticket for the fares
Was lost or left behind
“Good lack l’ quoth John, “yet try it on.”
“”T won't do,” the Guard replies;
And bearing wife and babes on board,
The train without him flies.
Now see him in a second train,
Behind the iron steed,
Borne on, slap dash—for life or bones
And still, as stations they drew near,
The whistle shrilly blew,
And in a trice, past signal-men,
The train like lightning flew.
Thus, all through merry Killbury,
Without a stop shot they ;
But paused, to 'scape a second smash,
At Dedmanton so gay.
At Dedmanton his loving wife,
On platform waiting, spied
Her tender husband, striving much
To let himself outside.
“Hallo! John Gilpin, here we are–
Come out !” they all did cry;
“To death with waiting we are tired "
“Guard!” shouted GILPIN, “Hi!”
But no—the train was not a bit
Arranged to tarry there,
For why?—because ’twas an Express,
And did despatches bear.
So, in a second, off it flew
Again, and dashed along,
As if the deuce ’t were going to,
get in-
Will risk my limbs, and go.” With small concern or beed. With motive impulse strong.

We’ll go by the Excursion Train,
Which makes it still less dear.”
John GILPIN poked his clever wiſe,
And slightly smiled to find
That though on peril she was bent,
She had a careful mind.
The morning came; a cab was sought;
The proper time allow’d
To reach the station door; but lo!
Before it stood a crowd.
Oh, here's a game! oh, here's a go!
A running such a rig' "
A signal, hark!—the whistle screamed –
Smash! went the windows all:
“An accident l” cried out each one,
As loud as he could bawl.
Away went GILPIN, never mind—
His brain seemed spinning round;
Thought he, “This speed a killing pace
Will prove, I’ll bet a pound !”
They came unto their journey's end,
here they at last stood still.
And then—best thing that he could do—
He booked himself for Town;
They stopped at every station up,
Till he again got down.
Says GILPIN, “Sing Long live the QUEEN,
And eke long life to me; -
And ere I'll trust that Line again,
Myself I blest will see!”
THE JOLLY BARRISTERS.
At the late Assizes, the Barristers on the Western Circuit found
themselves with literally nothing to do at Dorchester. The Court was
of necessity closed, and a holiday was forced upon the learned gents,
who, instead of taking it to heart and sitting down in a state of
despondency over their empty brief bags, resolved to turn pain into
F." and challenge to a game at cricket a club in the neighbour-
god. There was a sort of affinity between the game of cricket and
the game of law, which perhaps made the former agreeable to the
learned gents, when deprived of the latter pastime. The putting
§§ stumps, savoured slightly of the ceremony of stumping up,
which their clients usually, perform; and the justifying of ; was
pleasantly typified in the due º: of the wickets. There is
something half agreeable and half melancholy in this reduction of a
whole Circuit to a game at cricket as a resource against the utter
absence of occupation. Some of the Barristers hit with all the force
of utter desperation; and, one sentimental junior who was ſagging
out, when the ball rolled to his feet could not forbear the expression of
regret that, with all his fagging for the last ten years, the ball had
never been at his feet in a professional sense; and that he had been
acting as long stop in vain, while stopping so long in a profession by
which nothing had been realised. ... Our interest in the game is tinged
with a sort of sadness, when we reflect that, though it was sport to the
learned cricketers, it arose out of a state of things which was death to
their prospec's.

when we remember the popular adage,

his anointed Majesty—the King drawing on the Jew's jaw instead of
his bank. Finally, you will not spit upon the memory (by the way,
you must not spit in company anywhere in England,) of WAT TYLER
as a rebel to his lawful ºf seeing who once riz against good
KING GEORGE, the father of his people (JonATHAN giving his old
father such a tarnation licking).
OUR CAPERS AT THE CAPE.
Now that there is a prospect—for the sixth time these two years-
of a termination to the war at the Cape, we may *:: to see it con-
verted into a subject for one of the series of historical dramas at Astley's,
where we have the satisfaction of seeing our battles fought over again
and again, without finding them set down as a large and disagree-
able item in the year's estimates. The Cape War abroad takes pounds
out of our pockets, while the same thing—much better done—at the foot
of Westminster Bridge, mulcts us of, at most, a few shillings. The
affair must however be quite finished abroad before it is ripe for treat-
ment by the Astleian dramatist at home, who never looks at a subject
until it is in a state that admits of the waving of the British flag, over
some crushed Khan, reduced and ruined Rajah, or humbled Emir, who
in an attitude of abasement crouches at the foot of the British com-
mander, with a glare of red fire streaming in upon him from the wings
and footlights.
Should the Caffre War soon admit of this happy treatment, we
would recommend to MR. BATTY to secure, as a "set 3. the
original Water-Kloof which has figured so frequently in the despatches.
This ingenious piece of machinery, whatever it may be, is evidently
adapted peculiarly to the purposes of the stage; for, if we are to
believe the despatches, it is capable of being captured over and over
again, without being any the worse for wear, inasmuch as it seems to
come out as fresh as ever, and, in a word, “as as new,” when-
ever there is a fight; and when the “taking of the Water-Kloof” is
sure to be the principal incident, a splendid “line in the bill” might
be made with such a subject as the “identical Kloof,” and, if it could
be supplied with “real water,” (there are plenty of pumps in the
theatrical world) the illusion would be perfect. . .
It is still doubtful whether the “Kloof” is in the hands of the
British or of the foe; and as it has been a sort of shuttlecock be ween
the two during the whole war, it is difficult to guess who, in the latest
battle, may have given it the latest blow with the battledore. If, the
Caffres have still got it, there will be little difficulty in º; it by a
spirited offer; º indeed, it is possible that we may see it defended
on Astley's stage by real Caffres, who, when they have no longer any
engagement with the foe, may be open to an engagement with a
manager.
Trial of Faith.
A Subscription is opened to defray DR. NewMAN's expenses in the
very reputable trial of “Achilli v. NEwMAN.” Masses twice a week
are offered as a tremendous bait to all those “benefactors” who will
subscribe. We are afraid the donations tumble in very slowly—or else
DR. NewMAN would never be put to this expedient of a-uass-ing a
public subscription.
No, 584,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
And Hun, who has a tute in song, kinds offered, then and there,
ExTRAORDINARY NootuRNAL BALLoon|º
ASCENT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.
Kindly Communicated by PROFEssoR PUFFY.
Belfast, September 7th, 1852.
MY name is PUFFY, Mr. Punch.
Perhaps that humble name,
Though it’s not for me to say so, isn't
quite unknown to ſame, .
For since I first was capable in child-
hood of reflection,
Each branch of science has received
from me a close inspection. ..
Thº, my parents were not partial,
they remember to this hour
My childish speculations on “The Go-
cart's motive power;” -
And how I cut the bellows up, in the
futile hope to find
If by spontaneous action they could
generate their wind. . .
At school, of other principles the
knowledge I obtained, ..
And the “Science of Fºllº. from
my pea gun quickly gained ;
And when I fought with BILLY Jon Es,
'twas but that He and I,
If we were “Isodynamical” had often
wished to try. -
After that, I studied chymistry at
college with my gyp, . . .
Who taught, “What spirit is the
base of Cider Cup and Flip,”
“How Soda Water oft the head from
vinous fumes will clear,”
And “What the change it undergoes
when combined with bitter beer.”
It is n’t then remarkable, with all this preparation, ..
That I’m a shining member of each learn’d Association,
Or that my humble writings on every novel theme
To their volumes of Transactions should have added many a ream.
It was I detected strychnine in the brewers' bitter ales;
I correspond with Reichenbach by sympathetic snails;
It was I who wrote the “Westiges,” and, with convincing pen,
Shewed how a man has been a goose, and can be a goose again;
It was I, who first to steer balloons a certain plan projected;
It was I, who in the Red men first the lost ten tribes detected;
The learned SMEE concedes to me, without a thought of flattery,
I first perceived a man to be a mere voltaic battery- . . .
Whose every action, feeling, thought, pain, sorrow, or felicity,
Depend not on himself, but on the laws of electricity; -
So that if a thief should steal our watch, we musn't charge the action
To any moral flaw, but to the “Force of his Attraction: ”
Whilst if a Lady should refuse our suit her approbation,
'Tis only that she has too strong a “Current of Negation.”
These data, Sir, are given here from no absurd vainglory,
But simply that my fame may be a voucher for my story, - - -
Whose tenor on your startled mind will force this strong conviction,
How true the proverb is, that Truth is stranger far than Fiction.
I had sat with all the Sections, in turn throughout the day-
And had read a little paper of my own in Section A,
Upon “Comets, as examined with two eyes or with one,
And what they seem to those who squint,”—and when our work was done,
We had all gone off most willingly to dinner with the Mayor, {
For though tables of statistics are our hobby, pride, and care,
There are some other tables we're as ready to compare.
And musing, as Irambled home, on all our conversation,
And how my paper had obtained the Section's approbation:
I felt a tap upon my back, and looking round, beheld
SIR. RodeRick, accompanied by worthy MR. WELD.
tº Com; º !” said they both at once, “We’ve borrowed GREEN's
alloon,
And are going to make a voyage to the ‘Glimpses of the Moon,”
We’ve got a new lactometer for Woods and FARADAY,
To analyse the curds they find within the Milky Way,
And LANKEstER is going to seek (he loves ragouts and spices)
A new º: to make hare soup from the Comae Berenices.”
Hard by the car we met with HINckes calling Bunsen o'er the coals,
For saying that the natives spoke Sclavonic near the Poles;
Whilst BIBt, who on the zodiac writes, did piteously implore us,
To carry up an Irish Bull and mend the breed of TAURUs.
Now up we went and soon perceived a singing in our ears,
Which some of us opined must be the Music of the Spheres,
When we got amongst the planets, CoLonEL Portlock called to MAPs,
To ask, if with jº. gun they armed the shooting stars;
And we also learned with pleasure from that planet that ToM SPRING,
Having won the Belts from JUPITER, is the pet of SATURN's Ring.
It was here that WELSH and NICKLIN let their quicksilver escap",
And Colonel SABINE got us all into a mighty scrape,
By proposing that in MERCURY (I think the man was daſt),
ith the help of URSA MINoR, we should try to sink a shaft.
Of course, as soon as MERCURY perceived this daring feat,
His dander, as the Yankees say, riz up to fever heat;-
And though that dashing fellow, HIND, tried hard to set us free,
By pitching out, to lighten us, the whole of Section, D-
He set the Dogstar at our heels, and caught us in the lump,
And bade AQUARIUS come and put us all beneath the Pump,
Who, having drenched and beaten us with all his might and main,
Sent us off to Limbo Patrum for the night in CHARLEs's Wain.
There we found the shirt of triple brass which the hardy sailor wore,
Who first, as HoRAce tells, essayed to pass from shore to shore;
There, too, the belt ULyssés got in the storm from NEREUs’ daughter,
And the grateful look he paid her with (slightly damaged by salt water);
And a head of young ADöNis, labelled VENUs' only joy,
And a smaller head—his property—when quite a little boy;
Eight or ten old constitutions, by the French in turn forsaken,
And a little heap of broken oaths, which the PRESIDENT had taken;
The Yankees' title to the Isles on the Peruvian shore;
And the Christian moderation of the ReverEND MR. MooRE;
A dog which JUPITER had tossed when, as a bull, he ranged;
And some pieces of that shower of gold into which the god was changed,
When º the crannies, chinks, and holes of DANAE's well-barred
closet,
There fell, as MURCHison would say, an auriferous deposit.
Well! the man who kept these precious things—I think his name was
PETTIGREw—
Was so vexed to see us handle them, that in a mighty pet he grew,
And ramped and raved, and chafed and fumed, till I quite shook for
read,
And started, Sir, to find myself stretched out upon my bed,
In the Cat and Salutation, and to hear to my surprise, ..
At my door the Boots exclaiming, “If you please, it's time to rise.”
Hayti and France.
SouLouque, Emperor of Hayti, has begun to imitate Louis NAPO-
LEoN, ordering his consuls abroad to prosecute the wicked newspapers
that shall disrespectfully speak of SouLQUQUB. This imitation bodes
no good for Hayti. It may be continued. Any way it is best to be
upon the watch. Wherefore, we advise the Haytians not to go to bed
on the 2nd of next December.
SLEEPERS WIDE-AWAKE.
It is said that there are certain mesmeric somnambulists ". in
in
their state of clairvoyance, prescribe for patients by intuition, an
this way drive flourishing medical practices. The question is, whether
or not these somnambulists are genuine Sleep-WALKERs?
Irish Craniology.
At one of the late meetings of the British Association, MR. JAMEs
GRATTAN is reported to have read a paper on a collection of crania
discovered in the “Round Towers” of F. and. The learned lecturer
made some interesting remarks on the distinctive peculiarities of the
Irish skulls, of which the principal characteristic—though he seems
not to have noticed it—probably was, that of having mostly been
broken during life.
EPIGRAM FOR BRADSHAW.
“Ha!—hark!”—cries HARRY ; “there goes distant thunderl
Now has that bolt killed any one, I wonder?”—
“Thunder!” quoth Dick, “you hear the Railway Train:
I want to know how many that has slain.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIWAIR.I. 127
THE CRUSADE AGAINST ENGLAND ! -
To M.R. PUNCH.
ERMIT me, my very dear Sir, to
utter a meek remonstrance
against a “leader’ in that ad-
mirable—when not prejudiced
—paper, the Eraminer, entitled
“Religious War Cries.” The
animadversions of the Eraminer
were occasioned by an article in
the Univers — the well-known
liberal and enlightened organ of
the French priesthood—appa-
rently preaching up war with
#1. in order to the con-
version of that noble—but here-
tical—nation by the sword.
“Now, my very dear Sir,
what I want to explain to you
and your readers—in fact, the
whole world—is, that the Er-
aminer has fallen into the com-
mon error of not making the
proper allowance for the figura-
tive spirituality of the language
of Catholicism. When the Uni-
vers exhorts the faithful to war
with England, it does not mean
by war sanguinary hostilities.
It by no means intends to
invoke against you artillery,
Minié rifles, muskets and bayo-
nets. It has no more view to
the overthrow of your political
constitution and the destruction of British power in Europe than good
FATHER CAHILL has when he seemingly rejoices in the prospect of
England's downfall, and in the idea of French soldiers capering in your
blood, and rolling in your viscera. - -
“Oh no! my dear Sir; language such as this is but the playful
affectionate extravagance of pious love—of enthusiastic charity run a
little wild: it must all be taken in what our PUsey—yours and mine-
calls a non-natural sense, understanding black to mean white. English-
men have too long been imposed upon by the appearances of things.
Your forefathers believed in-because they ſancied they saw—the
ſagots, stakes, and flames of meek MARy. They beheld merely the
species—as we say—of such objects, and of roasting victims; who were
alive and merry all the while. These hallucinations are but devices
of the enemy, and can always be dissipated, instantaneously by the
slightest scratch of a saint’s toe-mail—if perfectly genuine. -
“The clergy of France do mean to invade you—with an army of mis-
sionaries. They will have no trouble to cross the Channel; that voyage
they will perform, each on his cassock, miraculously unseen, or super-
naturally invulnerable, by your cruisers. They will advance upon you
armed with spiritual canons, with no more material weapons than
crucifixes, which they may lift against you, but will never hit you with.
Soutanes, surplices, pontificals, monastic habits will be their regimentals.
They will be accompanied by troops of Angels with wings—some
actitious, some, perhaps, real. They will fire upon 3. only with
holy water—by the help of an Irish Brigade. Should you still hold out,
they may, in the last resort, bring to bear upon you that supernatural
piece of metal alluded to by the Bishop of Luçon in his luminous
pastoral—that medal which marks ‘sudden conversions,’ is known as
‘miraculous,” and ‘has filled the world with prodigies.” No red-legged
French soldiers will you see in this army: no red legs at all but those
of yºur own CARDINAH.
‘Oh, do not think that the benevolent clergy of France, as represented
by the Univers, are instigating their flocks to cut your throats, shoot
you, brain, you, run you through the stomach | They provoke
the faithful to shed your blood? Oh, no! they would only have
them shed their own tears for }. conversion. Yes, my very dear
Sir, we weep for you when you think we are cursing you. “Weep still,
always weep, evermore weep,” is our rule and maxim. What seem the
yellings and howlings of our sweet CAHILL are nothing but sobs.
For you the eyes of many a saint have poured forth gallons of water,
many bottles of which have been preserved; and their contents occa-
sionally work the most astounding marvels. With heads of Jesuits on
Temple Bar, and quarters of Oratorians on London Bridge; with
sacerdotal martyrs bleeding, or banished, on every side; we cannot
afford to have it imagined that a journal like the Univers is fomenting,
and a paper such as the Tablet inviting a military invasion of your
native land. Not that our ecclesiastics wish to shun martyrdom;
they court it for their own parts, and object to it only for the sake of
their persecutors.
{
“Pray, then, my very dear Sir, advise your readers to abandon the
absurd idea that our priesthood, in France and elsewhere, are striving
to work the humiliation of England. They do, indeed, labour to the
end that John Bull may humble himself—but quite voluntarily.
This undoubtedly they expect that he will do; yes, we hope to see him,
spontaneously attired in an ignominious dress, do penance in Regent
Street, and after lying some hours in a state of “prostration,’ submit
to be whipped publicly in Golden Square. Ah, soon may we behold that
interesting—affecting sight!—speedy be the advent of that day so
edifying to Christendom | But never—oh never think that we dream
of subjugating him by violence! Oh, dear, no l. You would do us a
deal of good if you would employ your lively pen in lightly and jocularly
ridiculing the supposition that danger to liberty, here or elsewhere in
Europe, is to be º from the machinations of our priests.
“Yes, my very dear Sir; let me disarm your suspicions, and per-
suade you to go comfortably to sleep. I would address to you—with
a proper difference—the admonition of your heresiarch CroMwell.
Put your trust in the miracle of LA SALETTE; but don't—don't take
the trouble—on any account, to keep your powder dry. Withal,
believe me “Your sincere Friend,
“WERAX,”
A Black Diamond from Northumberland.
MR. LIDpell, calls Downing Street the “Seer's Cell”—the Seer
being our clever friend DISRAELI, and LoRD DERBY, we suppose, is the
Over-seer... We agree with the above expression of the “Seer's Cell,”
which we think very pretty, but there is a trifling error in the spelling.
It should have been spelt “Sell,” for such it certainly will turn out to
be. We are the more particular about this error, as it stands to
reason every Seer should be perfect in his Spell.
MORAL PHILOSOPHY FOR THE BOUDOIR.
. It has been remarked that ladies, have generally a great fear of
lightning, and this has been *..." ascribed to their natural
timidity; but the truth is that it arises from their consciousness of
being attractive.
A DERBY PROPHECY.
WHAT has got Dizzy P
He's very busy
About a new scheme of Taxation;
And when it comes out,
There is n’t a doubt,
But what he’ll astonish the Nation!
The Prince of Literary Darkness.
THE Electric Telegraph the other day communicated this shocking
announcement:—
“A decree, signed “Louis NApoleon,’ suppresses the Paris journal, the Corsaire."
. Truly, MR. Louis NAPOLEoN is playing the very Printer's devil over
in France.
Glossary for French Republicans.
LIBERTY.—The freedom of unutterable opinion.
FRATERNITY--Brotherhood in degradation.
EQUALITY..—The uniform condition of frogs under a flagstone.
THE METEOR OF cremorne.
THE appearance of shooting-stars is common at this time of the year.
Perhaps MADAME Poitevin may be included among these phenomena,
as a star descending in a parachute.
A Canonical Con.
WHY is the Office of Registrar of Wills only worth £9000 a year
Because it’s impossible to get more (MooRE) out of it.
TREAted WORSE. Than A DOG.
“Too much care,” says the old saying killed the dog,”—but this
saying could never be applied to our Railways, for if a living soul is
killed on a Railway, it never arises from “too much care,” but rather
the want of it.
PERFECTLY TRUE.-A lady, who has just returned from Paris, upon
being asked what kind of tyranny was Louis NAPOLEoN's, answered :
“Par-Fêtes (Parſaite).”
M. Poitevin's cruel and dangerous balloon exhibition has been
| called by a first-rate wit “a Rabid Act of Horsemanship.”

ANOTHER FRENCH MIRACLE I
By Electric Telegraph.
ScARCELY has France taken breath—scarcely
has she recovered herself from extacy upon the
tidings of the miracle on the mountain of
Salette, as vouchsafed to two shepherd boys,
than another miracle has occurred in the Tuileries.
As yet, we can only give the merest outline of
the miraculous manifestation, as we have received
it, in solemn brevity, by the electric spark of sub-
marine telegraph.
“Miracle in Paris. Midnight. Gardens of
the Tuileries. Two sentinels—wide-awake.
Suddenly, NAPOLEoN THE GREAT stood before
them in flash of gunpowder. Smelt like myrrh
and frankincense. NAPOLEoN put soldiers
through exercise. Gave both crosses of Legion
of Honour. Pointed in direction of Place Wen-
dôme. Said of himself he had been a great
man: but he was only le Petit Caporal to the
NAPoleon then in his boots: but he must first
be Emperor. And then Nºroivon pointed
towards Notre Dame; and then his little hat
changed to crown—crown of France—and then
iron crown of Italy.
“NApoleon said France would never be happy
until his nephew was Emperor.
“Saying this, NApoleon slowly rose from the
earth, and hovered over one particular chesnut
tree: the heels of his boots kicking the branches.
He then disappeared.
“The sentinels both speak of the apparition,
but one flatly contradicts the other; which the
Archbishop of Paris declares to be a miraculous
evidence of their truth.
“One fact, however, is certain. The chesnut
tree, kicked by NApoleon, is covered with a
second crop of chesnuts.
“Five hundred priests are picking them; and
still they grow. Every chesnut marked with W.
E. N.—of course Wive Napoleon, Empereur.
“A basket of these chesnuts—all the clergy of
Paris with their robes hastily put on-has been
solemnly carried to Notre Dame. Prayer—at
high service—will be laid on.
“The profligacy of certain infidel republicans
sneers at the solemn fact of the chesnuts, and
cries “Catspaw.”
The Beauty of Contrast.
Would a negro's teeth look so very white
were his skin not so very black?
Would ljiaNA be so very demure were not
WENUs so very skittish?
Would TheRsites be such a poltroom were
not Achilles such a hero?
Finally,–would the Lord Chancellor of the
Tories, the promoted Sugden, look in his ermine
so very white as a Chancery reformer, were not
the promoted STUART so very black as the sup-
orter of all Chancery abuse? If Loºp St.
º, be a Chancery Virtue, he is thrown
into the best contrast when MR. STUART is
made Chancery Vice,
Father Thames's Epitaph.
INFECTION o'er the town I bore,
Commissions were in vain:
The Times might storm—Ibraved reform-
And died a Tidal Drain.
Rulers of the Railways.
It is high time that a change should take
place in the constitution of our Railway Boards
of Directors, the individuals at, present com-
posing them having their minds by far too
narrowly limited to commercial views: so much
so, that their only notion of their functions, as
governing bodies appears to be, that of
less degrading than some of those which have been recently resorted to,
lines for the purpose of adding up sums.

THE DUCHESS'S OWN DOCTOR.
A REMARKABLY ingenious medical advertisement has recently
appeared.
vº. all know that a physician cannot advertise in the ordinary way.
On pain of jºi excommunication, he is forbidden to publish
his address, terms, testimonials, in the newspapers; promulgate these
particulars in hand-bills or posters on the walls: or proclaim his cures
after the manner of PłofessoR Hollow Ay. . He must not display
inscriptions in front of his house such as “Yes! this is the Dºctor's.”
“Waik In!” “All Kinds of Cases Treated Here!”, “Noted House
for Indigestion!” “Consumption Cured!” and the like invitations to
a phthisical and dyspeptic Public. He is precluded from sending men
and boys about bearing placards or banners, walking between boards
or driving vans emblazoned with his name, style, titles, residence an
ji success. - -
A fashionable physician-evidently that—has most, adroitly, sur-
mounted this obstacle to the extension of his celebrity, in a letter
addressed to the Times with the signature of “L.C.” “My initials,”
says the writer, “are pretty well known.” So are those of MoRISON the
Hygeist. Yet Morison finds it necessary to keep the world in mind of
his pills. Even so it seems expedient to “L. C.” to stimulate genteel
society's recollection of DR, LINKUMPEEDLE. We read the pretty
well known initials of “L.C.” backwards. .
“L. C.” comes out in the Times ; rushes, into the columns—or we
may say lists—of our contemporary, to break a lance with discourteous
“S. G. O.” in defence of injured dames. True (medical) knight that
he is –at least if he has not been, ought he not to be, dubbed such for
this service? The horrid man “S. G.O.” had accused female Fashion
of indolently, selfishly refusing, to nurse her proper offspring, and in-
humanly bribing Want tonourish them instead—defrauding Want's own
babes—which calumny DR. LINKUMFEEDLE-or Sir C. LINKUMPEEDLE,
that either is or deserves to be—thus rebuts :-
“I will answer for it that the ladies of England will bear every favourable com-
parison on this point with any others in the world, and that it is entirely unfounded
that they do not nurse their children because they think it a “great bore,' or that they
wish to ‘enjoy a season of gaiety;' or because they cannot bear that dear HAaBy
should be disturbed at night.”
LINKUMPEEDLE, when he says that he will answer for it that it is
entirely unfounded that &c., means to say that he will answer for it
that the assertion that &c. is entirely &c. This instance of LINKUM-
FEEDLE's grammar is noticeable as showing how nicely he has hit the
style, as well as caught the tone, of advertising literature—unless,
indeed, it is an original grace of composition. In the same point of
view the use of “that ” for “because” in “that they wish to enjoy,” &c.
is to be observed. Not content, however, with answering for it that
it is merely, though entirely, unfounded that the ladies of England do
not nurse their children, D.R. LINKUMFEEDLE avouches further, and on
the contrary, that
“The great bulk of the upper and middle classes of life do nurse their children
oftener than they ought. Most of those who do not cannot. The difficulty “M.D.s' find
is to persuade them to give up, when they are either injuring themselves or their
children—merely from a dislike to a wet-nurse.”
Now, vulgar medical science, as well as common and vulgar sense,
would demand to know what classes of living creatures—on two legs—
more than the “upper” classes, ought to suckle their own young f
Well housed, well fed, or only not well fed when luxuriously surfeited,
not forced to labour to exhaustion, at liberty to take ample exercise for
health: are there any kinds of animals better adapted by circumstances
for nurses f But fashionable “ladies' doctors” know better than
this—at any rate, know better than to say this—talk and write, rather,
like LINKUMFEEDLE, in the following strain :-
“Many a child has fallen a victim to this hesitation, though title and fortune
depended on its life; and many a mother, though “highborn aud wealthy,' has ruined
her health both of mind and body in consequence.”
“Those who recognise my initials,” says LINKUMFEEDLE, “will at
once see that I speak practically on this subject.” Yes: I am the
celebrated DR.—or SIR. C.—LINKUMFEEDLE, who inspect the tongue of
title and fortune, feel the pulse of the highborn and wealthy; in short
practise extensively among the “upper classes.” Therefore, do f
altogether differ from “S. G. O.; ” for—
“S. G. O.'s sympathies seem chiefly with the lower classes.
for that, yet"—
“Yet” for “indeed”—another grace of advertising literature—
“Yet I think be does them injustice in thinking they go out as wet-nurses for any
other motive than sheer necessity. Their poverty only compels them; the alternative
being the workhouse. They may be single, but the greater part of them are married;
the husband, perhaps, has gone off to the Australian diggings and forsaken them; or
a footman with £20 a year and his beer, thinks he can marry and support SUsAN the
housemaid. as well as himself, on that handsome income. All this is highly lament-
able, but I do not see what the ‘higher classes' have to do with it any more than
S. G. O. himself.”
How ſunny is LINKUMFEEDLE on poor John THOMAs, with stipend
of twenty pounds a year, and malt liquor, which fluid, indeed, is absurd,
compared to claret, and which wages are ridiculous to guinea fees |
What a nice man! So amusing, as well as feeling and considerate |
“JoHN,”-continues LADY BLANCHEALMoNDVILLE, who has seen the
Doctor’s letter in the Times, and “recognised his initials”—“my
nerves are quite unstrung this morning-go to DR. LINKUMFEEDLE with
my compliments, and beg him to call at half-past two.” LINKUM-
reBDLE comes, and discovers that the mind of LADY BLANCHE is too
much for her body, recommends chicken and cold brandy-and-water;
prescribes inſusion of gentian with spirit of juniper, enjoins a sojourn
at Baden-Baden; and—pockets his fee. Fee upon fee, also, does he
pocket in the same way, till the LADY BLANCHE ALMondville, bag
and baggage, is taken abroad with her sal volatile and poodles.
LIN sºrºroº's advertisement has done the trick—euge, LINKUM-
FerdLE I
LINKUMFEEDLE advertises himself to serve as an emollient-soap-box,
a pomatum-pot, a settee, ottoman, fauteuil, or any other comfort for
invalids—of the “upper classes.” Physicians who cannot stoop like
LINKUMFEEDLE to conquer practice, fail in their profession, and relin-
quish it to the LINKUMFEEDLes: whence, perhaps, the great discoveries
which are daily made in medicine, and the very advanced state of that
science in comparison with others!

The other day, the penny-a-liner who reported an impor-
tant inquest remarked of the prisoner under trial for
murder, that “phrenologically speaking,” his head was
“more intellectual than brutal; ” and that the mass of it
was “before the ears.” How beautiful it is to behold the
progress of science! We now see that the penny-a-liner is
qualifying himself to judge prisoners, as well as narrate
their fate. We shall have little to do, henceforth, but
consult our wordy friends, and we suppose it will be needſul
to pay them, per bump, for the job. This is all the more
gratifying, as we had been accustomed to consider that the
“liner” himself rather had his own ears to look after, when
phrenologically disposed, than the position of those of the
rest of the community.
This, is a proof that, the scientific spirit is gradually
prevailing, to the exclusion of the imaginative one. For
the “liner” used of old to invent, rather than analyse;
and startled us, when he did startle us, by “baking a child
in a pie,” or bringing blood from the clouds, rather than
by scientific deductions.

> * -- For, #: See, º º an old

Alºíſiº.day
When my old timbers rang fore and aft, boys,
To the shrill call of “Boarders away !”
When blood washed my scuppers like water,

But when, from the maties aboard me,
I heerd what the job was to be,
I'm blest but it reg'larly floored me
On such work to be ordered to sea.

THE FALSE HEBREW'S FALSE JEWELS.
A MODERN TALE, WITH A MORAL.
ONCE upon a time-(a *i. while ago)—there came to Chelten-
ham a young man of the Hebrew prejudice, with Hebrew cast of
countenance. , Black-black as lamb of Astracan—was his hair; full
and †: his nether lip; black his twinkling eye; “his prominent
feature like an eagle's bea !”
Now there was a Christian at Cheltenham, who knew no guile—
. he knew the youthful Hebrew whose sign-post likeness swings
adowe.
Now, this º Christian, being a thick-sighted man, saw, as he
§ believed, a dawning grace in that Hebrew’s countenance.
(Ear § indeed, must that man have got up that morning to have beheld
that dawn.)
The Hebrew began to turm and turn more of his back to the
synagogue; and more of his front to the Established Church. And the
kind, butter-hearted, but thick-sighted Christian of our story, observed
the gradual turning of the Jew: whereat he rejoiced exceedingly.
And the Hebrew’s eyes would seem to grow up to, and love a certain
church weathercock of Cheltenham; to love it as though the weather-
cock was of solid virgin gold, and not iron gilt. -
And when the bells of the Qheltenham church rang merrily forth, the
Hebrew would smile and smile, as though every silver stroke was a
crown-piece dropt in his omnivorous pocket.
And thus it continued, until the Hebrew became melted—as never
even Hebrew was melted—when the rejoicing Christian, taking the
kindly moment, asked the Hebrew to be baptized. With the greatest
pleasure in life: he would only be too happy. - -
But first—but first—the Hebrew must sell certain jewels: old,
family jewels: relics of fathers and mothers in Israel.
But, wherefore must the Hebrew sell or barter his family bits of
gold with emeralds and topazes of uncles deceased—garnets and stones
§ cats'-eyes of aunts departed Wherefore ? asked the pondering
risulan.
Because—replied the guileful Hebrew-because, fleeing from the syna-
§: and cleaving to the Established Church, he would be spat upon
and scorned by all of his former tribe; and his past connexion—the
Hebrew spoke with fervour—be smashed entirely.
The Hebrew desired to become a Christian, but he must start with
ready money. - - - -
Now the heart of the good, converting Christian mightily rejoiced
at this. I–said he-albeit not rich, will give you a fair price for the
gold and topazes of your uncles, and the cats’-eyes of your passed-
* aunts. - -
The Hebrew almost wept, but—did not. It is, however, needful to
the completeness of our story to say, that he took the money.
Forty pounds of current coin did that Hebrew sack from that
guileless Christian ; and then, with an exulting caper, kicking the dust
of Cheltenham, the Hebrew departed, and the Christian knew not
where he went. . -
The gold and jewels looked solid and real, and sparkled—how they
sparkled!—when they were bought and paid for, by candle-light—
but when the daylight came, the gold was Mosaic gold, and the
jewels glass. -
Now, whether that F. Hebrew, from time to time, sits with his
hat on in the re-opened synagogue of juke's Place—or whether he has
departed, not to dig, but to buy gold of the diggers—is unknown to the
hoaxed Christian of Cheltenham.
MORAL.
When young ladies and old ladies who would still be young—and
young gentlemen very green, and old gentlemen very scarlet-go to
St. Barabbas, and are shown the precious jewels of grace by the
Rºy EREND IGNATIus PolycARE BURNIT by candle-light, let the afore-
said ladies and gentlemen seal their ears to the milk and honey words
of the charmer, and ere, at any price, they make his doctrines, their
own, let them think of the Mosaic gold and the bits of glass, and wait
—and make no bond by candles—but in the broad, bright day.
Meum et Tuum.
THE Gold Mining Societies are laying claim to land in Australia,
which they are not in the least entitled to, and squabbles have already

TO LOUIS NAPOLEON ON THE SUPPRESSION OF
“THE CORSAIRE.”
SIR,
IAM very much afraid that what you have last done will turn
out to be a great imprudence. You have burked the last glitter of
intellect which displayed itself in your unhappy country; trodden
out under your blood-stained hoof the latest sparks of wit which
crackled among the embers of the liberty you have destroyed. What
is there, people will say, you are not .# of, now? Reasoning, you
knocked on the head—remonstrance, you suppressed. And now there
is to be no laughing, even' Everything is to be as silent, as it has long
since been as unproductive, as the grave.
My object is to remind you how imprudent this affair is. Of course,
I don't say anything about, the injustice of it. That is, we know,
not a matter of a moment's consideration. If one talked of your
honour, people would cry “question.” ... But your cautiousness—your
common calculation, my good fellow ! You have astomach—a stomach
that no blood can turn: remember it, I say, and be somewhat cautious.
For you know that the loss of empire would be to you the loss of your
victuals even. If you were kicked off the President's seat, you would
be put to it for a clean shirt. There's the point which distinguishes you
from the Bourbons. A Bourbon in exile has his ancestors, his manners,
and his quiet gentlemanly enjoyments to console himself with. But
ou, my dear Louis, would fall as a poor fellow falls from a brick-
ayer's scaffold—and be a subject for a hospital. A couple of days
would reduce you to a worse level than you were on before. You
would then be below billiard-markers.
Now, you see, if Paris can't have an occasional laugh, not even that
darling recreation, how will it stand the kind of thing long? You
might have left it its fun. For, in truth, you had made matters dull
enough. You see, you are not even a despot of esprit; the most you
can hope, is to pass for the ToM CRIBB, or so, of despots. Augustus

IN WINO WERITAS.
We wish our friends the savants would employ them-
selves usefully and successfully, in tracing out the causes
of the disease which afflicts the vegetable world. Like the
cholera, commencing in the dirtiest and lowest places to
ascend to the highest, the vegetable malady began among
the pota which are often crowded together too many
in a bed, and has now carried its ravages among the upper
circles of the vegetable kingdom—even up as high as the
loſty and elegant vines. Cold and rain are alleged as the
causes of this affliction; and the fact of warmth and drainage
being requisite for the health of a plant, will come in aid of
the argument for the necessity of attending to those thin
in the case of a human being. Perhaps, those who would
be insensible to these things as far as they might affect the
lower orders of the population, will begin to appreciate
them when they are found to be of vital importance to the
higher class of wines.
An individual who might not miss a few families cut
off by damp and fever in the courts or alleys of the city he
resides in, may possibly miss his usual supply, of choice
wines: and when he finds that the loss is owing to disease,
caused by cold and rain, it may occur to him, that if vegetable
life suffers from such causes, human life may be in want of
protection against similar evils., There are many who would
not be able to understand much inconvenience arising from
the failure of the potato, who will be deeply sensible of the
horrible effects of a deficiency of the vintage. The absence
of a luxury, made by custom a necessary, will perhaps
stimulate in many a dormant sympathy with those among
whom the actual necessaries of life are always difficult to be
obtained.
As good comes out of every evil, we have no doubt that
many will be awakened, as with a voice of thunder, b
this irregular shooting of the vine—this fatal but well-tim
attack of grape.

Who wears the crown to him who plies the spade
Under those windows where his corpse is laid,
Taking its rest at last from all those years of stir.
Years that re-moulded an old world in roar
And furnace-fires of strife—with hideous clang
Of battle-hammers; where they loudest rang,
His clear sharp voice was heard that ne'er will be heard more.
Courts have a seemly sorrow for such loss;
Cabinets politic regret: the great
Will miss his punctual presence at their state—
The shade of such eclipse even lowly hearths will cross.
But I, a jester, what have I to do

Comes not of honours heaped upon his head,
Comes not of orders on his breast outspread –
Nor yet of captain's nor of councillor's renown.
It is that all his life example shews
Of reverence for duty: where he saw
Duty commanding word or art, her law , , .
With him was absolute, and Fooked no quibbling glose.
He followed where she pointed; right ahead—
Unheeding what might sweep across his pan,

No hope, howe'er forlorn, but at her call he led.

Hard as a blade so tempered needs must be,
And, sometimes, scant of courtesy, as one
Whose life has dealt with stern things to be done,
Not wide in range of thought, nor deep of subtlety :
Of most distrustful; sparing in discourse;
Himself untiring, and from all around
Claiming that force which in himself he found—
He lived, and asked no love, but won respect perforce.
And of respect, at last, came love unsought,
But not repelled when offered; and we knew
That this rare sternness had its softness too,
That woman's charm and grace upon his being wrought:
That underneath the armour of his breast
Were springs of tenderness—all quick to flow
In sympathy with childhood's joy or woe:
That children climbed his knees, and made his arms their nest.
For fifty of its eighty years and four
His life has been before us: who but knew
The short, spare frame, the eye of piercing blue,
The eagle-beak, the finger reared before
In greeting *-Well he bore his load of years,
As in his daily walk he *. along
To early prayer, or, 'mid the admiring throng,
Pass'd through Whitehall to counsel with his Peers.
He was true English-down to the heart's core;
His sternness and his softness English both:
Qur reverence and love grew with his growth,
Till we are slow to think that he can be no more.

TO THE BENEWOLENT—WANTED £5.
We appeal to the benevolent and liberal: to those exalted souls with
deep pockets that, despising the wretched distinctions between man
and man by Mammon and no Mammon, would rescue the unfortunate.
The case is simple, pathetic, but of daily occurrence. Here it is in
brief: the penny lines of the reporter put into a little silver sixpence.
A young woman, named JANE TANNER—"a delicate-looking young
º whose face was shockingly disfigured,”—is unwillingly brought
y her mother to Worship Street, to charge her false lover—(impulsive
creature!)—WILLIAM Holloway, with an assault. On a recent
occasion he had knccked out two of her teeth: but she had forgiven
him that—he had expressed such sorrow fºr the untoward event. On
Tuesday, however, he came to her, and at once asked her for money:
“She told him that she had not then a penny, when he flew into a violent passion,
and dealt her such a violent blow in the face, that she became partially stunned, and
both her eyes were swollen and contused as they now appeared."
She endeavoured to escape; he then felled her to the earth, and—
(his poor victim was about to become a mother')—“continued beating
and kicking her about the body, till there was scarcely a part of her
person that was not covered with bruises.” Well, the betrayed,
outraged JANE TANNER would not prosecute at the sessions. “
no, Sir”—she said, and the words ought to have gone like knives into
William Holloway—" no, Sir, I can't prosecute him: let him go
away; I don't wish him to be punished.”
Whereupon Holloway is fined “the highest amount of penalty”
the law allows, namely, £5, or in default two months' imprisonment.
Holloway could not pay the money; therefore took a ride to
Coldbath Fields in the felons' van. Now, is HollowAY imprisoned for
knocking down, beating, and kicking JANE TANNERP Certainly not;
he is incarcerated for not having £5 to pay for the luxury. ad he
possessed £5—with another £5 to back him—he might have departed
to knock down, beat, and kick JANETANNER again.
A few days before at the same office, “a stylishly-dressed man, who
gave the name of GeoRGE SMITH" is fined £5, with the alternative of
two months’ duresse, for giving an inoffensive woman two black eyes,
and so wounding her face that “her dress was soaked with blood.”

Ws have little to say of this book. . The work speaks for its own
º: s s from booksellers' windows, railway stations, play-
ills. It is a book admirably cribbed; beautifully stolen; magnificent y
pilfered. The writer of the book is everywhere read, admired, and
plundered...The history of the introduction of the book to a discerning
British public is, moreover, peculiar, original, almost touching.
WIZENBELLY, the publisher, is asked to give his straightforward,
honest opinion of the book: in a plain, downright, candid, generous
way, becoming a man, and a publisher. WIzenbeliy pledges himself
to make the effort, and does it. He sits up; in the domestic temple, his
conjugal bed-room, he cuts the leaves, and enters upon the work.
WIZENBELLy is a man of strong emotions; in a word, he is an
enlightened º: He laughs a laugh and weeps a tear alternately,
- eeds with the Cribbing. He then—as he vaunts per adver.
tisement in the Times—wakes, MRs. W. (whom, in his pardonable
fondness, he designates as “rather, a strong-minded woman”) to hear
a bit of the Cribbing: for he, in his bibliopolical-(there’s a word!)—
softness, may be betrayed into a too generous opinion. He reads and
reads; and MRs. W. joins her laugh with the laugh of W.; and with
the tear of W. mingles her tear. This decides him; the book is a
great book, and the Cribbing will be a most advantageous Cribbing.
Now, how many editions are there of Uncle Bull's Cribbing; and how
much-how many farthings, for instance—may be paid to the American
lady who merely wrote the book?
“Pooh, pooh, that’s nothing,” cries Paternoster-Row. “Do not
the Americans plunder us?”
Very true-answers Punch—but two blacks do not, and cannot, make
one white. Or if they could and did, how lucky for America; for that
single fact would at once settle her slave question.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE FOGIE FAMILY PAPERS.
The NEW LAMP.
R. FOGIE had
orderedandpaid
for the lamp that
morning in the
City, and has
had it sent home
to his house, La-
burnum Pilla,
Hammersmith,
by the Parcels'
Delivery Com-
pany. It arrives just as
the Fogies are conclud.
ing dinner. The Fog IE
family consists of old
MRs. Fogie, age a
mystery even to the census
- collector; M.R. Fogir,
º the father of the family,
= age 40; MRs. Fogie,
F JUN., the mother of the
family, age (by her own
account) 30; Miss WIN-
TERBottom, sister to MRs. Fogie, Jun., age (by her own account) 31:
but, as she was born four years before Mrs. Fogie, Jun., on the
authority of the Family Bible, there is clearly an error somewhere;
MASTER SAMUEL Fogie, age 4, son and heir of the Fogies; Miss
EMMA Fogie, age 24, daughter of the house. And, on the day the
New Lamp arrived, they had to dinner MR. and Mrs. RAMMER,
on a visit from the country. The tart and jelly are on the table, and
the little Fogies kare just been admitted.
Enter JAMEs, the indefinite boy (who waits, looks after the horse and
chaise, and makes himself generally useful to the Fogies).
. James. Please, it’s a box by the Parcels' Delivery, and there's
sixnence.
Mr. Fogie (with excitement). Oh, here—(gives, sirpence); bring it in,
JAMEs. (To the whole table cheerfully and eagerly.) It's the lamp.
Old Mrs. Fogie (who does not believe in lamps, otherwise than as
dangerous and explosive contricances). The lamp, John ”
Mrs. Fogie, jun. (with a shade of severity and intense surprise). What
lamp, my dear?
Enter JAMEs with a bor carefully nailed and corded. The young
Fogies, with the instincts of childhood, rush upon it, and Master
SAM, who is of an inquiring tarn, has already purloined a fork from
the sideboard, and has made considerable way towards wrenching off
the prongs by inserting it under the lid.
Mr. Fogie (still earciled, but with a mirlure of that embarrassment which
belongs to every man who has done such a thing without the previous know.
ledge of his wife). Why, my dear, they are so very cheap and simple,
all § so much more light than candles, and I thought it ..".
so uselul-
Mrs. Fogie, jun. (with coldness). I wish you had told me you wished
to buy something for the house, John, and I would have given you a
list of things we really want (with a cutting emphasis on the “really,”
which makes M.R. Fogie thoroughly ashamed of himself).
Mr. Fogie. Well, my dear, I thought—you know—
Old Mrs. Fogie (with deep concern). Oh, my dear! only think—the
blacks they make; and then the servants never can clean 'em; and
didn't one explode the other day at Hampstead over two young men P
[Shakes her head ruefully.
Rammer. Oh, that was camphine ! - -
Mr. Fogie (glad to divert the conversation). Yes; and this is vegetable
oil, you know-costs next to nothing, and no spirit in it, so it can't
explode, mother; don't you see ?
Old Mrs. Fogie. Ah, well! my dear. I’m sure I hope not; but, as
for “can't,” there's no saying what they may do, those lamps. I'm
sure when your poor dear father once— -
Mr. Fogie (who knows what this promises—jumping up). Well, but
only look at it. It’s the neatest, simplest thing—here—
[Pushes away his plate and is rushing to the bor.
Mr. Fogie. Now then, JAMEs, get the screw-driver. Eh P Hollo!
(Discovers the fork inserted by MASTER SAM.) Confound that boy! if he
hasn't gone and twisted the fork prongs off trying to open the box.
(The detected SAMUEL indulges in an anticipatory wail.) I’ve a good
mind—(he is diverted from his parental intentions by the arrival of
JAMEs with the screw-driver. All crowd round the bor and MRs.
FogIE expels the little ones.) Oh, give it here.
Mrs. Fogie, inn (interested in ſpite of herself) Now do be careful,
John ; it says “glass—with care.”
Mr Fogie (prizing at the lid). Confound these nails!
Old Mrs. Fogie (who has a passion for making things useful in a way
never contemplated by their makers). Mind you don't split the lid, John.
It will do beautifully to keep the º: in, my dear (to MRs. Fogle,
jun.), with a padlock, you know. I’ve got one somewhere.
Rammer (who is of an impetuous and hasty nature).
Fogle; you’ll never get it open with that infernal—
Mrs. Rammer (whose life is spent in recalling RAMMER to a sense of his
situation). Joshua! (All follow Fogie's efforts with intense interest, but
with considerable diversity of opinion.)
Mrs. Fogie, jun. Knock it up, John.
Old Mrs. Fogie. Oh, mind! Now, JAMts, you put in the end of the
hammer.
Miss Winterbottom. Force it down, John.
Rammer. Here, I'll settle it in a crack.
[Seizes the lid and is about to settle it.
Mrs. Rammer (severely). Joshua!
[RAMMER is recalled to a sense of his situation, and abandons his
intention towards the bor.
Fogie (after violent but ill directed efforts, with the aid of JAMEs and
the advice of the whole party, has succeeded in getting the lid off in several
pieces). Here you are.
Rammer (about to plunge violently into the straw). Now for it !
Mrs. Fogie. Oh, MR. RAMMER. do mind-pray. It says, “glass–
with care!”. You'll break everything.
Mrs. Rammer. Joshua! [RAMMER abandons the attempt.
Mr. Fogie (in much ercitement, handing out the contents of the bor, and
making a dreadful |...}. strato). Here-mind—those are the chimneys
—take care with the globes.
Old Mrs. Fogie (taking her usual ominous view of things). Ah, my
dear, there’ll be sad breakage, you’ll see.
Mr. Fogie. Here's the stand, and here 's the reservoir. Here-oh
no–here are the wicks, and here are the scissors.
Old Mrs. Fogie. Ah! dear, dear! what a quantity of things, to be
sure! It's always the way with these lamps.
Mr. Fogie ºf to the bottom of the bor). And here's the oil-can-
the cheapest thing!
Rammer. By Jove! Now then-let's put it all together.
Old Mrs. Fogie. That's the stand, there; and here's something
(curiously eramining the reservoir).
Rammer (impetuously seizes it). That's the reservoir.
Old Mrs. Fogie. Now do mind it doesn't explode, for they're never
to be depended on. [The lamp is gradually approaching completeness.
Miss Winterbottom (with the dignified curiosity of a superior woman,
who has attended several courses at the Literary and Philosophical
Society, Hammersmith). What is the principle of the lamp, John ”
Mr. Fogie. Oh, the simplest thing possible, ANNE. You see that
rack. (All observe intently; old MRs. Fogie shakes her head sadly.)
Well, there's a spring inside—I don't mean inside the rack, but
inside the cylinder—here; and then there’s a piston somewhere.
Mrs. Rammer (in her literal way). Where?
Mr. Fogie (not quite so clear). Oh-inside; you've all seen a steam
engine?
All. Yes.
Mr. Rogie (leaping to a conclusion). Then you know what a piston is,
of course. Well, you put in the oil, and the piston forces it up; you
know you’ve wound it up first—I mean, wound the rack up—and as
the spring works, the oil is sucked up by capillary attraction.
Miss Winterbottom (who recognises the word). ¥. I understand (tc
MBs. Fogie, with an air of calm º it's the principle that
melts sugar in tea, my dear JANF. We had it beautifully explained in
MR. Toodles's last course at the Institution.
Mrs. Foyle. Yes; it's all very well for you, ANNE, who take an
interest in science, and chemistry, and that sort of thing, but I’m not
at all sure that I quite understand now how it all works.
Mr. Fogie (who does not feel very strong in the internal machinery of
the lamp). Oh! never mind that, my dear, it's the simplest thing to use;
in fact, it's the Carcel principle, you know.
Old Mrs. Fogie (whose forebodings have been much increased by the
description of her son). Ah! well, my dear, I'm sure I hope it will ali
be for the bes", but in your poor dear father's time—
Mr. Fogie (cutting her off as usual at this point). Now then, let's pour
in the oil. Where's the funnel P
Mrs. Fogie, jun. Now, pray, John, let me do it; you’ll spill it all
over the table cover.
Rammer (impetuous as usual). Here—here—now then, I'll pour—you
hold—there. MRs. Fogle holds funnel, RAMMER pours.
Rammer. Say when, MRs. Fogie.
Mrs. Fogie. Oh, stop, stop, it’s all over the table.
Rammer. Confound it ! ... [Tries to mop up the oil with a piece of paper.
Mrs. Rammer. Joshua

Otd Mrs. Fogie (whose fears of explosion zre incessant.) Oh, my dear—
please—do mind the light. Now, pray, John.
[FogIE makes ineffectual attempts on the wick.
Mrs. Fogie. Are there not direc'ions for use somewhere?
Mr. Fogie. Yes, I know there were some. Eh P (sees paper with which
RAMMER has tried to wipe up the oil, and seizes it.) Here they are—er—
all over that infernal oil; here—(reads), “Directions for trimming:—
Wind up the lamp a few minutes before lighting it.” Eh Pah—what a
*}. didn't wind it up a few minutes before.
mmer. Wind it up !
Mrs. Fogie. But it says afterwards, “The first time the lamp is filled,
the oil does not ascend to the burner for ten minutes.”—(Dictatorially).
We must wait for ten minutes.
k Miss Winterbottom. No, but that's after it's wound up, you
now.
Rammer. Now, wind away, Fogie, or it will never light.
Miss Winterbottom. You'll see it will be no use. [Fogie is irresolute.
Mrs. Fogie. Take the globe off before you do anything, or we shan’t
see when the oil gets to the wick.
Miss Winterbottom. Oh, it's sure to get there by capillary attraction;
but if you take off the chimney, the oxygen may get to it and prevent
countrustion.
Rammer (who has been turning silently at the rack). Hurrah!
here’s the oil—all over the top of the wick! Lots of it! Now then,
Fogle. Blaze away !
Mrs. Rammer. Joshua
Mr. Fogie (joyously). Now then, off with the chimney (fumbling
with match at wick, but succeeding at last in lighting it). There you
are.
Rammer (never satisfied with things as they are). Now, turn him up.
Mrs. º No, no, that’s the rack handle.
Miss Winterbottom. No, the other turns up the wick—that's the
wrong way.
Mr. Fogie. Now, do be quiet, ANNE, will you? He's right enough.
Mrs Rammer. Hadn't you better put on the chimney? (appealing to
her directions.) It says (reading) “Put on the .*. which fits in a
sliding holder, and so adjust it as to let the shoulder be a little higher
than the cotton.”
Mrs. Fogie. Shoulder? Where's the shoulder?
Mr. Fogie. Oh! that's the thing it fits in.
Miss Winterbottom. No, that's the slider, John.
Rammer. No, no; the shoulder's the swell of the chimney; there, you
see, if I put it up the flame rises (proceeds to demonstrate, and burns his
fingers). Confound it, I’ve burnt my flººrs, Oh! da–
Mrs. Rammer (very awfully). Joshua!!!
[Joshua swallows his expletives and submits to his burnt fingers as
he best may.
Mr. Fogie (finally settling the globe, and with an air of º satis-
ſºft, filiariv a few paces). There we are Delightful light !
isn’t i
Mrs. Fogie, jun. Well, John, dear, it is a very nice light, certainly.
All. Oh, delightfull
Old Mrs. Fogie. Ah! but when it comes to the cleaning, and the ser-
wants, and the danger—ah! [Shakes her head most prophetically.
Mrs. Fºgie, jun. But you must admit, Mamma, it’s a beautiful light!
Miss Winterbotton. And so beautifully scientific in its principles!
Mr. Fogie. Exactly—and so simple
Old Mrs. Fogie. Ah, # dears
[All look on cheerfully at the first performance of the New Lamp
except MRs. Fogie, who is left shaking her head.
THE WISDOM OF WISEACRES,
THERE are two principles on which the Income Tax may be levied.
Qne is, the common-sense principle, which it is º to explain.
The other is the mathematical principle—thus stated by “R.,” a corre-
spondent of the Times:—
“That it is to be levied on what we call productive property only—that is, on
property which, as a whole, under the influence of the industry of the people, is found
to acquire a certain increase in a certain interval of time.”
What is this but the proposition that the subject of taxation ought
to be Industry, alone?, Industry, says she had rather not—would
; to divide the burden with idleness. Mathematicians are clever
ellows at building demonstrations on data, but they sometimes take
for data things that are not granted. They have progressed so far in
their own science, as to have forgotten its first elements, and they
j upon postulates that, instead of being self-evident, are
I-101Culous.
BAD ORNIthology,
THE Munster News contradicts a report that the EARL of DUNRAven
had been “received into the Catholic Church.” For the Dun Raven,
perhaps, the reporter mistook some Green Goose.
PEACE AND WAR--HOT AND COLD.
T the idea of France invading Eng-
land, the Constitutionnel laughs on
one side of its mouth, and with
the other side most 'º
threatens. It at once talks mi
and honey—fire and bullets.
Invasion what folly! We love
England, but—couldn't we, if we
liked, pitch into her?
Invasion! May our hands never
be outstretched but to clasp
Englishmen, and—if they provoke
us, roll’em in the dirt, tread upon
'em, march over 'em, annihilate
em.
Invasion! May we never visit
London but with the palm-branch
—and wouldn't our holy bayonets
avenge Waterloo P
Invasion 1 May the soil of Eng-
land remain unpolluted by the foot
of hostility, but—let England re-
member that the new screw-ship
Napoleon—with twenty others-
could at a thought land 1500 men
upon Dover beach, and England
was never invaded but she was
conquered. Bless her, we say, but
let her tremble. -
In this fashion does France give
the kiss of peace to England. Even
as fire would kiss gunpowder.
DUBLIN REWIEW.
QUR own Correspondent informs us, that the Irish Brigade was
reviewed yesterday in Phoenix Park, with a view to its preparation for
the approaching campaign, by the General of the Jesuits. - -
The whole troop marched by the distinguished officer with their
colours—scarlet—flying. Their uniform-pea green with scarlet facings
–presented a gay and motley appearance: .. - -
After having performed the usual evolutions of falling in, and out,
uniting to act in a body, separating as light, skirmishers, § In
ambush, and circumventing the enemy, they exhibited the spectacle of
a sham fight. -
One of their most striking manoeuvres was the reception of a charge
of tailors and hotel-keepers, which they repulsed with great gallantry,
to the heavy loss of the assailants. - - -
fº fired several vollies of vituperation and invective with wonderful
effect.
In interchanging a º: of blank jokes they showed much com:
posure, and, it is hoped, will behave valiantly under the fire of contempt
and ridicule which awaits their projected onslaught upon the British
Constitution. - -
The auxiliary Puseyite and Destructive Squadron was present, is
order to take a lesson in tactics.
A strong corps of mental reserve was also on the field. .
The Commanding Officer expressed himself satisfied with the ap:
pearance of the Brigade, but it was generally remarked that they looked
extremely ill-conditioned. .
The ceremonies concluded with a Royal Salute to the representative
of the Pontifical Toe.
The renowned Brass Band was in attendance, and performed appro-
priate airs; the forces retiring from the ground to the celebrated
Marcia di Briccone,
A Line or two for Railway Passengers.
d RAILway Amalgamation is one of the prime causes of railway acci-
ents.
f the Companies were to run against each other more than they
do, the trains would not so often come in contact. . .
i. were less of collusion, we should certainly have less of
COLI1810n.
Haynau and History.
HAYNAU, not long ago, expressed himself to the effect, that he left
the vindication of his character to “History.” . This we submit to be a
delusion of the General's... He has observed how History records the
career of “WHITTINGTON,” and thinks that he, too, will be held in
honour from his association with the “Cat!”

A *ś his blue five fingers;

As, awaiting a wind,
On the Baltic shore he lingers.
From Erzeroom,
On the wings of doom,
(In the course which observers foresaw)
He has swept to the west,
And is now at rest
For a breathing-time at Warsaw.

Full of fever and fleas,
Ere he comes half his victory's won for

What need of his cramps,
When the ditches and * s

He' really ashamed
If folks think he has claimed
Any credit for winning the battle.
No! England's the place
Where he strips for the race,

Who, wherever he goes,
Will keep poking their nose,
And presuming to act as detectors.

Whom this greeting he sends
He fears he’d have no chance in Britain ;
But these friends, by good luck,

THE DIGNITY OF THE WORKING CLASSES
OFFENDED !
To the RIGHT HON, LORD JoHN MANNERs.
1 Y Noble LoRD,--I now take the
liberty of addressing §
Lordship, because , everybody
says that your Lordship ought
to have been e a Commis-
sioner of Sports and Pastimes.
My Lord, SIR. J.W. RAMSDEN,
Bart., as your Lordship may
be aware, came of age the
other day. To celebrate that
happy event, it was announced
by handbill that certain prizes
were to be competed for at
Longley Hall; valuable prizes,
some of them: one, a Set of
Donkey-Cart Harness; another
a Silver Watch; another a
China Tea Service and Tray;
another, may it º: your
Lordship, a Pig. The proposed
games were a Donkey Race:
capital fun, you know, my
Lord; Climbing a Pole: very
amusing, your Lordship; a
Wheelbarrow Race Blindfold:
a Hurdle Race on Foot; and
a Donkey Tournament: all
f. old English Sports, my
ord, particularly the last—
says you. Then there was to
come a variety of leaping and
foot-racing—including a Sack
Race; followed by Bell in the Ring, a, Pony Hurdle Race, and
a Foot Steeple Chase; the whole to conclude with Hunting a Pig
-clodhoppers chasing a pig, trying which can catch him, and ºwing
him round his head by the tail; pretty diversion, if not what you
call intellectual; and very gratifying to gentlemen lookers-on-
especially, as the pig's tail is greased. Now, my Lord, wouldn't
your Lordship say this was just the right thing ; reviving ancient
customs; “cultivating friendly relations with the humbler classes,”
to use the elegant language of genteel newspapers. Weren't all
these the very games and sports which the genuine Old English
Gentleman in the song would have delighted in, and most likely have
had acted at his own majority? Could any ceremonies have been more
fit and proper? Of course your Lordship would expect that if you had
been in SIR. J. W. RAMsden’s place, all the Longley clowns and clod-
poles would have flung up their hats for you, made a bonfire in your
honour, danced round it, and drunk your health with nine times nine,
as in gratitude and duty bound. And you would naturally suppose,
my Lord, you would have been applauded and praised by the whole
neighbourhood sky-high
“Instead of that—what does your Lordship think? A "crowded
ublic meeting,'—crowded, my Lord!—was “held in the Philosophical
all, Huddersfield'—I am copying a newspaper advertisement-" on
Thursday Evening, September 9th,’ at which the following disrespectful
resolution was passed unanimously:-
“‘That while this meeting highly approves of amusements for the working classes,
whose labour makes recreation at once necessary and useful, it would yet record its
strong conviction that the increasing intelligence and general culture of the age
demand that such sports and amusements be at least healthful and innocent, and tend
as far as possible to elevate the tastes, and promote the well-being, physical and
moral, of the people.'
“And then, my Lord, these terrible fellows also resolved:–
“‘That this meeting has seen with deep regret the announcement of a programme of
sports for the amusement of the people, in celebration of the majority of SIE. J. W.
Ramsdºx—sports which are, this meeting believes, of a highly objectionable character,
worthy only of an uncivilised age and people; and it hereby desires to give expression
to its indignant sense of the degrading estimate of the tastes, intelligence, and cha-
racter of the working population of this town implied in such programme, and recom-
mends, further, that out of self-respect and regard for the moral well-being of the
community, the working classes, generally, will abstain from all participation, even
as spectators, in the sports at Longley Hall, on Wednesday next.”
. “Shocking chaps my Lord. Fancy, your Lordship, these mechanics
tinkers, tailors, cobblers, and weavers, turning philosophers, an
meeting and passing resolutions-knocking out a Baronet's eye–in a
‘Philosophical Hall.” Only think of these fellows presuming not only
to despise the amusements of our ancestors, but also flying in the face
of a man of title, who, they say, has come into a million of money! I
asked, one of these º; what he objected to in such very
suitable recreations for the People; and his answer was, “Suppose the
PRINCE of WALEs were to come of next week, and the QUEEN
were to ask the aristocracy, in honour of the occasion, to practise good
old English sports in Hyde Park. Fancy the chivalrous Ministry
riding a “Donkey Tournament,” or racing in sacks. Conceive the
Lords and Commons at ‘Bell in the Ring,” or the Bench of Bishops
‘Hunting a Pig.'
“Oh dear! my Lord, to think of a Bishop hunting a pig! I told that
philosopher fellow that he shouldn't talk so... ." But,” says he, “why
not ? I know it's beneath the dignity of Bishops, and Lords, and
§º: to play such fool's tricks. Beneath their dignity—that's it!
ell, where lies their dignity? In their lawn-sleeves, ribands, acres?
No. In that which elevates them above the fool—in that which
renders them superior to the jackass-understanding, knowledge. If
we, Huddersfield working-men, have souls above donkey races, *
are beneath our dignity, I should think. I dare say SIR. J. W.
RAMsDEN means well; but how would he like, on the PRINCE coming
of age, as aforesaid, to be invited by HER MAJESTY to climb a pole for
a leg of mutton P’
“What state of things are we coming to, my Lord, when common
fellows think and talk like this? Not old English times over again,
I am afraid, your Lordship. I remember when a lout would have
thought himself highly honoured if requested by a gentleman to grin
through a horse-collar. Those days will never return, your Lordship;
ah, no! my Lord; the clowns and bumpkins have lost nearly all that
respect and reverence they used to have for large property and leather
breeches; very shocking, this, to
“Your Lordship's humble servant,
“Powder PUFF.”
HYMEN AND LOUIS NAPOLEON.
A FoEM of petition has been considerately drawn up by Louis
NAPOLEoN-and circulated throughout France-a petition to be signed
by the ...; classes, praying, heartily praying, that the President
will condescend to become an Emperor. “The man of God”—as
piously designated by the Bishop OF CHALONs—is entreated to cap the
dignity with a diadem. He has only to consent, and we doubt not
that another dove will duly bring another ampoulle—in humble imitation
of the dove that honoured St. Louis—full of the holiest oil, to grease
the President's head, that his uncle's crown (too small, no doubt, for his
nephew's caput) may, with a little wriggling in the hands of Mother
Church, be made to slip on, and fit. This, however, by the way.
One of the great fireside reasons for calling upon the President to
become Emperor is, that he may settle the delicate question of
marriage, at some time or other sure to agitate the paternal breast of
the labourer for his little one—
“Considering that with a President for 10, 15, or 20 years, the father of a family
cannot foresee under what political conditions the boy or girl now growing up between
his knees may be married.”
. Now this is a question, or rather consideration, that even now
interests French boys and girls, if there are such beings; for we have
always considered them as little men and women. It is a great
point with JULEs, aged four, whether he shall marry Hortense, rising
three, under a republican despotism, or an empire. Poor little JULes;
how can he prepare for future housekeeping Sweet HoRTENse—in
maiden meditation, sucking her little thumb-how can she decide upon
the fashion of her trousseau; for what might serve for a President
would be very mauvais ton for an Emperor.
It is supposed that all the boys' and girls'—we mean all the little
men and womens'—boarding-schools will petition the President, at
once and for ever, (all things are done for ever in France,) to settle the
momentous question.

THE Constitutionnel, in an article full of benevolent hopes that the
English may not know the misfortunes of an invasion, goes on to add
that nothing is easier, and that “ º has always been conquered

qualifies most materially the force of this sentence, as far as the present
i. is concerned. The actual possessors happening to be the
escendants of the conquerors, defeats the force of the suggestion that
England is to be want uished by any one who sets foot on her soil.
When an enemy sets }. there, we may expect England to knock

the experiment would find he had set his foot in it indeed.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN UNMARKETABLE MARKET.
OME remedies, as we all know,
are worse than the disease; and,
though, a slight bruise on the arm
might be lost sight of in a smart
counter-irritation got up about the
eyes and nose, there are few who
would, in their own cases, give their
countenances to such an expedient.
Everybody admits that Smithfield
Market is an evil that ought to be
put down: but there are some
persons strongly of opinion that to
fake it away from the heart of the
City, and lay it down in the bosom
of an elegant little suburb, is some-
thing like extracting a carbuncle
from a groggy old gentleman's nose
and transplanting it to a delicate
young lady's cheek.
If a cattle-market is out of place
in the atmosphere of Smithfield, it
will certainly be—with its million
- odours—a little trop fort for the
bamy air of Camden New Town. If over-driven bullocks are
unpleasant in a crowded street, they will be scarcely more accept-
.. in the squares and terraces leading to villa residences; and if an
eccentric ox is an unwelcome visitor at a wine-vaults or a china-shop,
he will be equally objectionable as a dropper in among the congregation
of a quiet suburban church. It seems that the intended site of the
new cattle-market is a nice genteel little neighbourhood, inhabited by
persons who seek repose there from the turmoils of the City. They
are, however, to be reminded of the struggles and noise of a town life
by animallowing and human bellowing—by the barking of dogs and the
snarling of drovers-by, in fact, Smithfield Market and all its horrors
being brought home to their very doors, or occasionally into their very
windows, if an infuriated beast takes it into its head and horns to
have a giance at the Home Circle.
We admit the difficulty of finding any place in which a cattle-
market would not be out of place, but we think it rather hard
upon the inmates of a little colony of suburban villas that their
retirement should be invaded by the drover and his herds, the
slaughterman and his victims, the butcher and his boys. Pastoral
life, admits certainly of a taste of the bucolic, but a cattle-market,
with all, its filth and dirt, would invest a semi-rural neighbour.
hºod with a little too much of the couleur locale. It is easier to say
where the market ought not to be than to suggest where it ought to be,
for even when “an open spot at a distance from town” is spoken of as
the proper site, it is still a very open question where such an open spot
can be found. Smithfield is going a begging: there is, as it were, a
great nuisance in the market, and we are not surprised that nobody is
willing to have it at any price.
A LOOMER! A SYBIL!! AND A SEER 1 || ||
MR. Disraeli for some time past has been a LoomER—in former
days his name was connected with a celebrated work, called the Sybil
—and now, in the words of MR. Liddell, he is “a SEER.” Such a
combination of prophetic qualities was never yet known in a person
who followed, as a profession, the art of conjuring. What "Wizard
of the North” can compete with him? What double-sighted youth
can see so far into the future as he can * What “Mysterious Lady”
can foretell half as many things as our wonderful Chancellor of The
ExchEQUER Blindfold him, and he will tell us everything that is
going to happen for the next ten years. HoRACE tells us: “Carpe
diem,”—but our Great Loomer is not satisfied with seizing to-day; he
wishes to seize this day twelvemonth as well. What ...i. things
we shall see when Parliament opens! The future will be unrolled
before us, like a tailor's pattern-book, and we shall be able to choose
what we please: “Robin's Soirées” will be deserted in favour of
DisBAELI's, and England will be proud of having a CHANCELlor of
THE ExchEQUER who is such an astonishing conjuror—a perfect
gºve in his way, with three heads—a Loomer! a Sybillſ and a
er . . .
HEAR, HEAR!—The Times lately observed, that there was a blight
in the crop of rising political talent. This seems odd, when we consider
the promise in the way of ears!

THE BALL AT MR. DISRAELI’S FOOT.
DISRAELI has attained to quite a dizzy height of fame.
After having got the first place but one in the Cabinet, he
has not only been made an addition to Tussaud's, but also
a multiplication in the music-shop windows, where his por-
trait figures on the exterior of a Polka, delineated as a
sort of “Beauty of the Budget,” with a curiously senti-
mental look of reproachful melancholy blended with disdain,
directed at vacancy. The Polka has been composed in
honour of the distinguished gentleman himself, and is
styled the CHANCELLOR OF THE Exchequer’s Polka.
hat connection, however, there is between dancing and
DisRAELI does not appear; he has a reputation for figures,
but we cannot as yet judge of his steps: and only see
him standing gracefully in the second position. According
to a daily advertisement, this “remarkably elegant, and
truly spirited Polka” should be ordered by “every lover
of good dance music; ” and might hence be inferred to be
a musical novelty, but a correspondent asks whether it is
not our old friend Jim Crow again under a new name?
It might perhaps equally well be conjectured to be Sitch a
Gettin' up Stairs with another title. When the CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchequER's Polka comes to be danced in Novem-
ber next, it is certainly more than probable that its prin-
cipal movement, will be rotatory, and that the Right
Honourable Gentleman and his partner will regularly turn
about and wheel about from Protection to FreeTrade. The
CHANCELLOR of the ExCBEQUER's Polka is offered at the
usual charge for such articles, but, we fear, will be found to
cost much more than that altogether—when we come to
pay the piper.

BALLQon ascents are now so numerous that we expect the air will,
before long, be navigated as much as the sea. In that case an
aerial Lloyd's will be requisite; balloons will have to be insured
nº less than ships: and persons will not venture in a balloon that is
advertised for a long voyage, unless it is properly entered as Alo
the Ballooning List.
The newspapers will be obliged to devote a certain space by the side
of their Shipping Intelligence to a new feature called into existence
by the increased, navigation of Balloons. Under this new head of
"Ballooning Intelligence,” we fancy we read, in two years hence, the
following particulars:—
NOTICE TO AERONAUTS/
FIXED LIGHT AT THE TOP OF STRASBURG CATHEDRAL.
The French Government has given notice. that for the future a fixed light will be
established on the summit of Strasburg Cathedral. This light will be visible at the
distance of 15 miles.
In return for this, great consideration, the French Government trustfully hopes
that all aeronauts will steer as clear of the Spire as possible, as the repeated shocks
against it have materially shaken its strength, and rendered its safety a matter of
great uncertainty.
NOTICE.
If the Balloon that was wrecked last Monday night on the top of Langham Church

it will be sold to defray the expenses.

The balloon then rose, and sailed gracefully in the direction of Hammersmith, leaving
the donkey they took up behind them.

BALLOON'S SPOKEN WITH.
The Tom Fool, from Rosherville Gardens, for a spot where it could land, Sept. 19th, in

The Gull, from the North Woolwich Tea-Gardens, for any landing-place but the
Thames, Sept. 20, in the Isle of Dogs.
The Canard, from the Hippodrome, Paris, for a corn-field where it could drop its
clephant with safety, Sept. 21, in the Park of St. Cloud.
The emigrant balloon, Carrier Pigeon, from Vauxhall Gardens, for the Antipodes,
June 5, in the middle of the desert. The Carrier Pigeon signalled it had a drunken
man on board that it was anxious to ship into another balloon.
The Earl Rosse, from the Greenwich Observatory, to make discoveries in the Moon,
July 22, at an altitude of 11,065 feet above the Earth.
We may return to this subject, as we have lunatic expectations of

may be considered intrinsically identical.

THE NETHERBY GAME LICENCE.
- UNCH, MY DEAR Boy, Though
you do, sometimes, in the
excess of your zeal for the
º: farmers, call us vermin,
know you are fond of us,
and would feel great plea-
sure in seeing myself at
your table to-morrow. You
would not like to have us all
utterly destroyed; you
would desire that some rea-
sonable compromise should
be made with the agricultur-
ists on our behalf. There-
fore you will be pleased with
a circular relative to our
family, which your old friend,
SIR JAMEs GRAHAM, has
addressed to his Netherby
tenants. This communica-
%, tion states that
v “‘SIR JAMEs GRAHAM, unso-
licited, has much pleasure in noti-
fying to his tenantry, that they
have his permission to hunt and
kill hares and rabbits on their
several farms, between the hours
of sunrise and sunset—the time for killing hares being limited to the usual period,
from the 27th of September to the 27th of February. Neither guns nor snares to be
used.’
“Neither guns nor snares are to be used—but SIR JAMEs GRAHAM
vouchsafes to allow his tenants to kill hares and rabbits, as many as they
can, by hunting. There is the course of coursing open to them for
prosecuting these four-legged trespassers; and, also, it would seem,
that of knocking on the head all the rabbits and hares that will wait
till the sportsman walks over them. Now, my dear Sir, doesn't it
strike you that this is an extremely mild and moderate concession to
the demand for the right to abate 'vermin P’ Shouldn't you, if you
were a rat, and the increase of your tribe had, at least in some measure,
to be limited, be sufficiently happy to be exterminated with such mer-
ciful restrictions? I do say that SIR JAMEs GRAHAM deserves the
thanks of every hare and rabbit on his estate for thus endeavouring to
mitigate their persecution by the farmers. But that those gentlemen
themselves will be equally obliged to him, is an expectation in which
I am sºld SIR JAMEs is very considerably too sanguine. His circular
proceeds :-
“This permission will be continued from the present date until further notice.
During its continuance, SIB JAMEs GRAHAM confidently expects aud trusts that such a
concession on his part will induce all his tenants, by themselves and their servants,
to preserve the winged game on their respective farms, to the utmost of their power,
for the amusement of himself, his family, and friends.'
“‘Such a concession!' I really fear, Sir, that the farmer who rejoices
—or ought to rejoice—in vassalage to SIR. JAMts GRAHAM, will be
ungrateful enough to tear his landlord's gracious proclamation in pieces
and stamp upon it, fling it behind the fire, or, more wisely, light his pipe
with it. For the man may, very possibly, fancy that he is mocked and
insulted by the request to subserve so assiduously the amusement of
a gentleman, by whom that very amusement—shooting—is expressly
interdicted to himself. He will hardly discern the immense favour
granted him in this unsolicited grace, this spontaneous indulgence, this
motu ſº as SIR JAMEs's ally, the Pope, would say: Therei
indeed, the Netherby farmer—and everybody, else, too, probably-

sionist. A mighty boon, to be sure, has SIR, JAMES GRAHAM con-
ferred upon his tenantry in licensing them to kill hares, provided the
neither shoot nor snare them. Yet I am sorry to say, Mr. Punch, .

MYSTERIOUS DISTURBANCES IN DOWNING STREET.
HERE has been, for some *
past, considerable excitement
in the neighbourhood of
Downing Street, in conse-
quence of strange and unac-
countable noises which have
been heard to proceed from
a portion of the building
wherein the Exchequer Office
is situated. The sounds in
question consist chiefly of a
sort of humming noise, some-
what similar to the moanin
ºf the wind so often heard,
and producing so melancholy
an effect, amid old ruins; but
it has been observed that the
humming continues, and in-
decd is loudest, when there is
not a breath of air stirring.
At intervals this mysterious
murmur ceases, and a succes-
sion of groans, as if proceeding
from some person engaged in
painful exertion, is clear
audible. Some listeners post-
tively state that, amid the
contsed mixture of sounds,
they have from time to time
distinctly heard arithmetical
numbers articulated; and
they compare the whole effect
upon the ear to the sort of buzzing that commonly proceeds from a parish school at work
ciphering. Those who have read the “Seeress of Prerorst,” and are aware of the spiritual and
mystic relations of numbers, will probably be confirmed by this circumstance in referring
these singular acoustic phenomena to a supernatural origin; but philosophers of a more about Belgrave Square, how the calves that a
material turn may probably surmise that the troubl., d spirit is no other than that of the -
living MR. Disraeli, absorbed in the severe labour of getting up his budget, and calculating
CHARLEY'S MY DARLING.
It seems that royalty as represented by
CHARLes The FIRST-at Charing Cross—is once
more in danger; and some enthusiastic loyalist
lin, been calling out, through that tremendous
speaking trumpet, the Times, for a second Resto-
ration. In this instance the Royal martyr will
not be brought to the scaffold, but the scaffold
will probably be brought to the Royal martyr.
It seems that the pedestal is in such a dilapidated
state, that, unless CHARLEs is established on a
firmer basis, the restoration will become im.
possible.
We ourselves have often been struck by the
melancholy appearance of poor CHARLEs, upon
whom the elements have inflicted two black
eyes, by blowing into them a large accumulation
of soot from the surrounding chimney-pots. As
to his nose, we can only say that “not to put
too fine a point upon it,” it has dwindled to a
pug; and the head of the monarch is so dis-
figured by dirt, that it will require a good deal of
judicious chiselling, before the family resemblance
to the chip of the old block will be perceptible.
The Rights of Hospitality.

Hospitality, like property, has its duties as
well as its rites, and I mean to say that it is the
bounden duty of a man, if he invites you to dine
with him, to give you a good dinner.

A GREAT BALLC, ON CASE.
Before MR. Punch.
CoNTRIBUTOR A 1. appeared before the magistrate to charge a public
exhibitor and veteran aéronaut, named DisrAELI, with cruelty to a
Protectionist donkey.
It appeared that MR. DisbAELI, who has been before the public for
ºf years in various capacities, having shot for a wager in
Printing House Square at one time—having been engaged in the fire-
work department at St. Stephen's—having then entered the ring against
Bobby PEel—and subsequently gone about with a street telet cºpe to
let out for the inspection of distant objcts—has been of late attached
to the service of the eminent aeronaut DERby. Dr RBy constructed,
some time ago, a large balloon capable of containing in the car a
considerable party, with the intention of rising to a height in sight of
the public hitherto unattained by anybody of his class. It devolved
on DiskAELI to manage the invention, and generally to provide
whatever was likely to be attractive to the public.
Accordingly, the Balloon Cabinet was constructed, and the party to
ascend formed—comprising Johnny MANNERs, a young man from the
provinces, who had played minor parts in pastoral dramas for some
years; the rustic, PAkington ; MALMEsbu Ry, a man-miller, &c.;
and the Dish Aeli above-mentioned. The public expressed fome
doubts as to the safety of the trip, the weather being squally, and did
not seem likely to encourage the project, when DIs RAELI, anxious to
provide attraction, hit on the plan of carrying up a Protectionist donkey
attached to the balloon. -
The Protectionist donkey belongs to a curious breed, not yet extinct
in this country, and concerning which naturalists are divided in opinion.
Fverybody admits that it is a variation of the common British ass—but
the laws of its production, and the reason of its extraordinary perma-
lence as a separate type, have given, rise, to much speculation.
On a certain day, in pursuance of his object, DisRAELI attached to
the balloon an animal of this species. The beast was suspended by
fastenings invented by the aëronaut (technically called bonds of the
agricultural interest) and its legs dangled loose in the air. As the
balloon went up with the aéronauts seated in it, it hung suspended in a
ludicrous and painful manner, while the man Diss AELI sat upon it, nay,
went through strange gesticulations on its back. The spectacle was
lighly attractive, particularly to rustics.
say to the charge of cruelty
Disraeli denied that the animal suffered any pain. He knew the
donkey well (a laugh); it was insensible to its situation.
Contributor A 1 remarked that the animal landed after each exhibº-
tion in a high state of º and trembling—
Disraeli (interrupting). That’s nothing. He has done that at many
a gallop in Buckinghamshire.
Contributor A 1 submitted that this was an unusual state of
agilation of the animal. He did not deny that it was used to strange
treatment, but there were bounds tººl which animal experiment
ought not to be allowed to go. Why, they had a bag of corn dangling
before it, but out of reach, which it hurt itself in stretching for. Was
it not so?
Disraeli. It was looming in the future (a laugh).
Contributor A. l. Besides, your worship, this balloon never takes
a flight without high danger to the public, as well as to the donkey. It
s up irrespective of weather. It fell in the other day with a gale
rom the Atlantic. It risks breezes from the North. And in
emergencies, it flings out grappling-irons anywhere, and will lay hold of
a church, or a farmer's dwelling indifferently, to the high danger of both.
Disraeli. The Semitic element—
Mr. Punch. I do not doubt that the Semitic element has a relation
to the donkey; but, without going further into the matter, enough has
been shown to prove to me that the Protectionist donkey suffers from
the purposes he has been recently put to, by your party. I must, there-
fore, caution you against any future abuse of the kind.
DiskArll was j to say that he was tired of the donkey,
and would throw him overboard when occasion offered; but, owing to
his unintelligible manner of speaking, the exact purport of his words
was not discernible. The Court then rose.
WRONG ON THE FACE OF it.

We cannot believe this of a noble nation like France; for, under their
present despotic ruler, we should say it was decidedly the “FRENch

in Church and State; and that
respect extends to our glorious
Constitution in Govern-
ment also. Yes, glorious con-
stitutions we Britons must be
admitted to have, and precious
hard work we give our consti-
tutions, all three of them.
There was Catholic Emancipa-
tion—what a wrench that gave
our glorious Constitution in
Church—not to speak of the
Test and Corporation Acts,
just before. How any but a
really wonderful Constitution
in Church could have stood
such inroads I leave it to the
candour of FATHER NEWMAN
to judge. Then, as for our
glorious Constitution in State
—as it has survived the Re-
form Bill and the Repeal of
the Corn Laws, I think one
may say it is proof against
most attacks.
Happily our flºº. Con-
- stitution in Local Government
- has not yet been so severely
tried as either of our other glorious Constitutions. Private Bill
legislation, with its attendant bulwarks of Parliamentary fees, Parlia-
mentary agents, and Parliamentary counsel, still secures the Briton's
inestimable privilege of self-government—that is, government for
self—in contra-distinction from the communistic principle of govern-
ment for one's neighbour. - -
commenced an insidious attack on this holy principle, so admirably
defended by MR. ToulmIN SMITH ; and a good many other dangerous
measures, such as the Baths and Wash-houses Act, the Common
Lodging-Houses Act, and the .Nuisances Removal, Act, are all
formidable allies of the first-mentioned revolutionary statute.
Happily, however, they have not done much mischicf yel, but they
have inserted the small end of the wedge; and if, Britons don’t take
care, they will find their cesspools drained, their ash-pits invaded, their
refuse carried away—no one knows whither, their water-butts abolished,
their gullies trapped, and that sacred principle of "doing what they like
with their own” trampled under foot on every side, by some poking
Officer of Health or audacious Inspector of Nuisances.
Still, though the evil is imminent in the country, London may be
said to be comparatively safe. The successful struggle made by the
Water and Cemetery Companies last session, shows that Parliament is
awake to the levelling and dangerous, principles of the so-called
“Sanitary Reformers,” and that vested interests are still properly
represented in the legislature. - -
am happy to be able to confirm, by personal experience, the infer-
ence drawn from our legislation in these matters.
It is in the metropolis that we must look for the most striking exhibi-
tion of the blessings of our great Anglo-Saxon principle of self-govern-
ment. Determined to view it in some of its proudest manifestations
I spent the other day in their investigation, through those cheerful an
odoriferous, districts — St. Olave's, St. George's Southwark, St.
Saviour's, Rotherhithe, and Lambeth. I am happy to say that through-
out these districts self-government is flourishing....The Inspector of
Nuisances is rarely seen, or when seen is treated with the contempt he
deserves, as the minion of a central despotism fulminating its unre-
garded edicts from somewhere or other. Even the scavenger is a rare
bird of passage, here, and when he does come, his ministrations are
chiefly confined, as is right and proper, to the streets where the
inhabitants are respectable, and can remunerate him adequately for his
trouble. In courts, where filth is only removed to be replaced, what
is the use of a scavenger ?
The levelling uniformity of “system” is, throughout these districts,
scouted with that independence which belongs to the British character.
Every landlord drains his premises as he likes, and in many cases does
not drain at all. What good reason can there be, he very properly
asks, for putting down drains for a set of tenants who will use them as
repositories for blacking brushes, brickbats, and old hats If there
Briton. I have been brought
The Public Health Act, however, has
must be drains, it is clear that the old four-foot brick sewers are the
thing for these neighbourhoods. It is true they do not carry off the
filth, but then they afford comfortable accommodation to the blacking
brushes, brickbats, and old hats. Besides, their construction furnishes
work to the honest builder, while their frequent repairs give employ-
ment to a respectable and hard-working class of artisans.
Nothing can more clearly show how wicked and groundless are the
charges against the Water Companies than, a perambulation of these
localities. Scarcely a court but its stand-pipe at the bottom. In
order to save trouble to the inhabitants the water is turned on by a
main-cock, and flows for a stipulated time (often as long as an hour and
a half ') never less than twice a week, often three times, and, occasion-
ally, even daily, while the pipes over the water-butts are free from all
complicated apparatus of taps, and run while the water is on, of them-
selves, as it were, and all for the same time. As the landlords exercise
their British privilege of providing butts of all sizes, of course the small
ones run over before the large ones are filled. It may be said that much
water is wasted in this way, and that much dampness of walls and
foundations is thus occasioned. But what a brilliant confutation does
the practice afford of the charge of niggard supply brought against these
public-spirited Companies!, They stint the poor in water! Why, there
is not one of these courts where they don't let twice as much run to
waste as is used. -
Again, there is an admirable thoughtfulness shown in the position
chosen for these water-butts. Conscious of the importance of the
supply of water being kept near the spot where it is to be thrown away
when done with, the water-butt is generally placed within a foot or two
of the open cesspool. *.*. may tell us that it there
imbibes poisonous gases, and becomes dangerous to use; but do they
consider the comfort of the poor over-worked housewife, who by this
arrangement is enabled to draw the water she wants with one hand,
while she empties what she has fouled with the other? - - -
I was sorry to find, however, that even in these favoured districts
that despotic and un-English body, the Commissioners of Sewers, had
been at work recklessly covering over the open ditches, which for
centuries have formed such convenient channels for the ing off of
house refuse—with no more trouble than the emptying of a slop;pail, or
the thrust of a besom-and have put down, along their course, ridiculous
and insignificant tubular drains, of some five or even six inches
diameter! - -
ſt is gratifying, however, to be able to record that, notwithstanding
their impertinent intrusion, the independent landlord is still master of
his own ploperty, and has, in most cases, acted up to his rights, by
refusing to put down house-drains to communicate with the childish
tubular arrangements of the Commissioners, while the formalities with
which a provident legislature has ſenced round any attempt at compul-
sion by this abominable central Board, effectually prevent them from
forcing the independent proprietor to avail himself of their theoretical
pipes, which thus remain unused, monuments of the ineffectual
assaults of ever encroaching centralisation.
These are facts which make one proud of one's countrymen. The
same spirit which resisted the imposition of ship-money, is still battling
against . drainage, and many a Lambeth Hampden is, even
now, waging a modest but heroic warfare against the Caroline preroga-
tives of the Sewers Commissioners. - -
Against the national importance of cultivating this sturdy spirit,
what use is it to quote the statistics of a despotic and central Registrar
General P What is it to me that ſever is never absent from these places
—that infants do not rear. and men die before their time—that sickness
engenders pauperism-that filth breeds depression, and depression
drives to drink? What do you mean by telling me that cholera slew
in Rotherhithe its 205 victims in every 10,000, in St. Olave its 181, in
St. Saviour's its 153, in Lambeth its 120, while in the Strand it carried
off only 35, in Kensington 33, in Marylebone 17, and in Hampstead 8
out of the same number P Still, British landlords did what they like
with their own, and self-government is unimpaired. The satellites and
slaves of an encroaching centralisation are kept at arm's length, and if
they have succeeded in putting down sewers, at least we have triumphed,
in not laying our house-drains into 'em.
. It is with pride, therefore, I repeat, that whatever may be the case
in the country (where I regret to see the hateful Public Health Act
seems to be extending its ravages), in London we are still enjoying the
enormous, the invaluable privilege of self-government, and that if
Epidemic Cholera should visit us again, we may confidently show him to
his old haunts in 1832 and 1849, and so convince him that, in this free
country, he, too, is at liberty “to Do what HE LIKEs with HIs own.”
“Why Don't you Speak Out!”
FROM the impossibility of making our present Ministers say what
they mean-or even, what they do not mean—the observation that
was once made by TALLEYRAND of a celebrated. Nobody, may with
equal point be turned round upon them—“Ces Messieurs ont un grand
I talent pour le silence.”

AN IRISH HOWL AT A HERO'S wAKE.
To a Writer in the Galway Windicator.
SIR,
. The most valuable of tributes that any one can bestow is
the praise of a true man; the next best is the abuse of a false knave.
You have rendered the very highest homage—which it is in your power
to render—to the memory of our great Duke. - -
While every sound-hearted, person in the kingdom is extolling the
heroic devotion to right, the generous disinterestedness and self-
sacrifice for which our departed Chief was ever distinguished, you, on
the contrary, say—yelping:—
“There was not an atom of chivalry about the Duke. He did what he was paid for,
and he did it well; but he did nothing more.”
True Irishman that you are!—of the CAHILL and MAC HALE breed.
WELLINGton himself, indeed, was an Irishman—of the other sort.
And then you howl on thus:–
“There was no heart in his fighting. He was the beau ideal of ono of those Swiss
commanders, who led their countrymen under the standard of the Dutch against the
Hottentots or Carribs..”
Here, however, we must try, back a little with your invective,
which just previously has run in the following strain:-
“Were we still following the standards of France—were we still as of old shouting
Faugh-a-ballagh under the bright º of the silken banners of hostile countries
—were our exiled countrymen shouting and bleeding, as a hundred years ago, fore-
most and vociferous in the armies of the French monarch, as when they pitched their
tents beside the foaming Elbe and the rapid Iser—when they bivouacked in the glens of
the Alps, and bled upon the margins of the Padus, what would have been the conse-
quence? The field of Waterloo might have been another Fontenoy."
Characters like you, should, it is proverbially said, have good
memories. Yours is so treacherous, that in writing one sentence you
forget the other that you penned immediately before. What manner
of soldiers were the Swiss? and what difference was there between
those mercenaries and the “exiled countrymen” to whom you allude,
as “shouting and bleeding” in foreign pay—except, perhaps, that the
Swiss were not so remarkable for shouting “Faugh-a-ballagh,” or any
other nonsense, and were, however, equally forward in action, not
so vociferous?
But to return to your vituperation of the DUKE:—
#: was, in a word, a Duo ALD DALGETTY, without the vain boasting of that hireling
soldier.”
Ah, Paddy—you dog!—a little vain boasting—a spice of rhodomon-
tade, a smack of balderdash—Faugh-a-ballagh!—Whurroo!—a touch of
nature, just to make us kin—would have been a redeeming feature—
wouldn’t it?
Whurroo! Hoo!—You open again on the dead Lion:—
“He served a commercial people steadily, rigidly, soberly, regularly, just as a com.
mercial people like to be served; it was such generals as WELLINoron—men of a
trading quakerly turn of mind, without any of that nobility of character, without a
single particle of that ennobling romance which extenuates the faults and endears the
memory of the Goofneys of old and the MURAts of modern times—men like WEL-
LINGton carried the banner of Carthage into the llanos of Spain.”
No, small Pat, there was no romance about the DUKE OF WEL-
LINGTON; no romance of your sort. Truth, howling Paddy, was his
grand quality; reality, which the highest romance—not your romance-
only imagines: this he acted out, shaming the “dhivil,” and all the
dhivil's crew, or pack of hounds. A man of “a quakerly turn of mind!”
—Irish traitors will be sorry if our defence against foreign foes shall
ever be entrusted to a protector as quakerly. Will they not, Sir 2–
you ought to know.
The quakerly conqueror of NAPOLEoN would have done better at
Manchester than at Waterloo, in your cynical opinion:—
“Men like WELLINGroN, traffickers in war, are precisely the men whom a nation of
shopkeepers are certain to evolve—a man who manages his troops well, but would
evidently manage a counting-house better.”
Nation of shopkeepers—yes! Vagabonds and thieves of the world
that work for the “dhirty shilling,” instead of borrowing it when they
want it, liko gentlemen. The Duke was so “palthry” as to pay his
weekly bills. He was “mane” enough to be positively respectable,
Just the “could º spiritless oreature to be admired by a
“nation of shopkee ers.” Precisely so:—the rather that he was not
“evolved” by the “nation of ºf..." but by the other nation.
And now for the climax of your cry from the kennel:—
“WELLINgron never laboured for a moment under the delusion that makes young
and generous hearts consider the pride, pomp, and circumstance of war as something
glorious and ennobling. He was no boiling enthusiast—he was cold, rigid, and cal-
culating—in a word, the Iron Duke.”
No. WELLINGTON never conceived that there is anything to admire
in simply encountering or inflicting death or mutilation. Nor did any
delusion induce him to regard drums and fifes, colours, uniforms and
parades, either in themselves or in their relation to carnage, as
“glorious and ennobling.” What he did consider ennobling , and
glorious was, to fight to the death—if need were—not for fighting's
sake, not for vulgar applause, not for the renown of a big bully, not
treasonably under a foreign standard, but for the sake of that country
which now blesses his memory-profaned by a small ignoble animal.
He was no “boiling enthusiast;” no, indeed : but there is an
enthusiasm which is above boiling point, though it does not bubblo—
and does not evaporate. This enthusiasm, says "Up Guards and at
them l’” at the proper time: but does not shout “Faugh-a-ballagh’’—
though occasionally Faugh! without “a-ballagh’' when something
intensely offends its moral nose ! Faugh! The enthusiasm which you
have excited by your filthy outrage against the Dead almost chokes
3981901%.

It’s time this child war lookin' out elseweres for suffin snug.
This crittur's sick of Injun ways, and all their pesky dealins.
Wolf mutton nohow don't agree with this here niggur's feelins;
We trappers was som pumkins wunst, but things arm’t as they were,
And so I’ll make back tracks before the Pashes raise Iny hair.
I'll jine them coons, who're gwine this fact down everythroat tecram,
That all this Western heap of airth belongs to UNCLE SAM;
A moshun wich them Spaniards kinder ortn't to condemn,
For what they gev the Injuns wunst, we’re gwine to giv to them.
So, if they show their sassy airs, I º shouldn't wonder
If some on 'em should then be obligated to go under, -
For Kill B'ar shoots Fº quite, and when I gits a sight,
Darn me if I can hold him in, his trigger is so light.
Yes! We're the Suns of Freedom, and the airs of all the West;
We’ll keep this half of airth, and leave the Britishers the rest:
And if agin our lorful rites they dare to make a head, .
And say wearn’t the raal right grit—Wagh I won't we give 'em lead
And when our knives and guns have proved the Justice of our cause,
We’ll show them Spanish goneys the buties of our lors,
Till the unenlightened warmint shall one and all agree
That our larning and our manners have tort ’em to be free.
With the hosses of Kentucky (them chaps of Colonel Boone's),
The Buckeyes of Ohio, and the Missisippi Coons,
The Corn cobs of New Hampshire, and the 'kansas Ringtailed roarers
Are united in one mighty band of peaceable explorers.
And when the stars and stripes o'er the Western world shall wave,
Our free, peeowrful nation, so wartuous and brave,
Careering for’ards, right on eend, shall seem to each admirer,
Like some great Buffler, makin' tracks, across the vast parairer!

TO AUSTRALIA FOR A SHILLING.
In the race of competition for cheap fares, everything is outstripped
by the announcement of a visit to the Australian, Gold Diggings for
one shilling. We have made the voyage, under the experienced con-
ductorship of MR. Prout, and have enjoyed all the pleasures of the
trip without the drawbacks of sea-sickness, short provisions, insuffi-
cient accommodation, or any other of the evils to which emigrants are
liable. The passage is quite a pleasant aſter-dinner affair, and, instead
of sitting over our wine at home, we have enjoyed the sample of Cape
and Madeira drawn—not from the wood but from the water—by the
clever artists who have united their talents in describing pictorially
the passage to Australia. The intending emigrant to the Diggings will
do well to go and look upon the true picture in Regent Street before
he embarks for, perhaps a mere waste of time, on the waste of waters.
He will then learn, not only the fact that all that glitters is not gold,
but that gold itself may have the shine taken out .#it by the º:
to be endured in finding it. Not that Ma. Prout's Diorama of the
Gold Fields is likely to discourage emigration, but, on the contrary, to
render it beneficial by setting people right as to what they may expect,
and thus make tolerably sure of their expectations being realised.
Inconsistent Humanity.
Why on earth do the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals make such a fuss about M. Poitevin's taking up a single
pony or a bull under his balloon, when they allowed him the other day,
without interference, to ascend from Cremorne with no less than
twenty-two asses, whose sufferings in the descent, judging by the
account of one of them “who saw and felt it all,” must have been of
the most serious description ? It is true that they have the advantage
over the bull and pony, that, if brought into court, they can at least
describe what they endured?
That's VERY REPREHENSIBLE.

PERHAPs it was The Clerical GENTLEMAN who has Just
A NEW CHAIR FOR OXFORD.
It appears that the provision for instruction in that department of
knowledge comprised under the denomination of the Literae Humaniores
is incomplete at Oxford. Within twenty-four hours after the event
which all other Englishmen were mourning, the Heads of the Univer-
sity laid themselves together to consult about choosing a new Chan-
cellor; and in two days more they and other “Fellows” of similar
taste and feeling got §§ a requisition to invite the EARL or DERby to
stand for the Chancellorship. Under these circumstances, it is quite
evident that there should be forthwith established a Regius Professor
of Decorum, in order to the better instruction of the Oxonian mind in
propriety and decency. There was a school whereat the sciences in
eneral used to be taught for twopence a week: tuition in manners
eing imparted for twopence more. If this seat of learning is still in
ºil. may furnish a cheap and competent Teacher of Behaviour
to the other.
A Court of In-justice.
A New Court has been built for holding the Westminster Sessions,
where it seems nothing can be heard—the architect having perhaps
come to the conclusion that #: may as well be deaſ, as she
orgotten the old motto, Audi alteran
is said to be blind. He has
partem, but he may probably have arrived at the conclusion that the
same result will be achieved by hearing neither one side nor the other.
The prisoners have been the only persons favourably considered,
for there is a spacious and convenient dock; but there are numerous
currents of air traversing the Court, which may also be designed

810ie-Wind.
How To BRUISE YOUR OATs.-Send them by a cheap Excursion
Train, and if, by the time they leave the railway, they are only half as
well bruised as the passengers, you will have no cause to complain.

NO NATIONAL DEFENCES!
T the present time certain
sensible and well-disposed
persons are ... distributing
about handbills, with the
object of dissuading young
men from volunteering into
the militia.
In order to second their
triotic intentions, the fol.
owing considerations are
offered to those whom they
may concern.
A bounty of five pounds
is no consideration to any
working man, for having to
undergo the fatigue and
danger of a long fortnight's
military service, at a dis-
tance of, perhaps, more
than a dozen miles from
his native village, in the
course of the year. The
pay and keep which he re;
ceives as long as he is called
out, are not worth mention:
ing; as the poor and half
starved condition of every
British soldier clearly
shows.
There is no fear whatever
of any invasion. The
French have quite lost
their passion for glory, indeed they have lost all their passions except
those of a tender nature. They act now upon sober calculation,
from rational motives; and in choosing Louis NAPoleon for their
President and inviting him to be their Emperor, they as much as
roclaim to all the world that they desire the Nephew to avoid the
ſncle's example. - --- -
Louis NApoleon himself is a man of sensitive conscience, whose
ambition is arrested by the slightest scruple, and who would shrink
from causing the least #. and misery even in a foreign nation,
although in order to accomplish his most cherished design. But even
if he were a fellow who sticks at . so strong a Christian feelin
prevails in France, and the religious public of Paris is so ij
that if to-morrow he were to shout “Wengeance for Waterloo !-Let
us embark for England 1" not a soul would follow him.
Even if the French were to invade us, they would not hurt us if we
did not hurt them. They have plenty of money; and their soldiers, in
an enemy's country, always pay liberally for what they want, so that a
French invasion is more to be hoped than feared, and would tend to
the advantage of the common people rather than not.
The French are susceptible, but their affection is refined, and their
army would offer no attentions but those of the most delicate nature to
our wives, sisters, daughters, and mothers.
A CARD.—To Epidemics in Search of a Situation.
O BE DISPOSED OF, in Rotherhithe, St. Olave's, St. Saviour'e,
St. George's Southwark, and St. Mary's Lambeth, a number of Superior Plague
Walks, doing a great stroke of business, and affording a most eligible opening to any
respectable Epidemic out of a situation; the Walks having the advantage of an old-
established connexion with those well-known metropolitan agents, MEssas. Typhus
and ScARLATINA, and having been occupied both in 1832 and 1849 by Ma Cholks A,
during his establishment in this country. These Walks will be found replete with
every requisite for successful prosecution of the business, several Patent Manure and
Bone-boiling and Gut-dressing Manufactories being situate in the neighbourhood,
from which the strongest gases may be procured in any quantities, and at the shortest
notice.—N.B. Thames Water laid on, and no drainage; the Walks lying within the
jurisdiction of the Sewers Commission. For any old-established or young Epidemic
this would be a splendid opportunity, as the Boards of Guardians are ready to furnish
every facility, and as the inhabitants are regular consumers and might be expected to
take a quantity. Apply, for particulars, to the Metropolitan Grave Yards, the Fever
and Small Pox Hospitals, the Office of the Sewers Commission, 1, Greek Street, Soho,
and the Union Houses of the several districts in which the Walks are situate,

DANCING FOR DIVINES.
-
WE see that a Dancing Academy has been opened in Sermon Lane,
Doctor's Commons. The pupils here “go in” for serious dancing.
Young gentlemen—sons or nephews of the superior clergy—are
instructed in the fashionable “Sinecure Walse,” and “Prerogative Court
Quadrille,” so celebrated for the elegant “Registrar” pastorale as danced
by PROFEssoR MooRE, to the tune of “Ten Thousand a Year.”

The British public does not, perhaps, clearly understand in what
sense the locomotive engine annihilates time and space. The railway
machine accomplishes that stupendous achievement by throwing the
traveller out of the sphere of local and temporary existence.

A DOUBLE RAP AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE.
MR. Punch has ordered the subjoined Petition to be printed:—
To The Honour ABLE The House of CoMMONs IN PARLIAMENT
THAT Is To Be Assem BLED.
The Humble Petition of the London District Postmen
HUMBLY SHEweth,
That although the Profession of Authorship is in a somewhat less
deplorable state than it was in formerly, the case of your Petitioners
constitutes a sad example of the inadequate remuneration afforded to
Men of Letters.
That in 1847 many of your Petitioners received salaries of twenty-
two—and more of twenty-one shillings—a week, since when their
labours have been increased and their wages diminished, so that their
maximum weekly salary is now twenty shillings; and herein they
submit to your Honourable House that they have not been fairly
compounded with.
That the work of your Petitioners is performed on their , but not
as Members of your Honourable House perform theirs, your Petitioners
having to be in constant motion, whereby a hole is rapidly worn in a
pair of boots, and, therefore, in a pound, the payment of which sum,
or thereabouts, is necessary in order to the acquisition of which boots,
as the English and Scotch Members of your Honourable House may
be aware. Wherefore your Petition.crs humbly complain to your
Honourable House that .# your Petitioners, are among the worst-
used men that walk in shoe leather.
That in consequence of the Government Order that Christmas
atuities at Public Offices should be discontinued, the Public has been
ed to suppose that your Petitioners had been altogether prohibited
from receiving Christmas Boxes; in consequence of which serious
mistake, your poor Petitioners have found the Christmas Box very
generally shut.
That your Petitioners are anxious to rebut, as far as they are con-
cerned, the charge of improvidence which is made, perhaps with too
much reason, against Literary Men in general. But that out of a
pound a week, it is quite impossible for them to make any provision for
old age; very difficult, indeed, to find a wife and family in seven days’
vict
*-
That the maximum Superannuation Allowance of your Petitioners is
nine shillings a week, whereas that of the other London Letter-carriers
is fifty pounds a year. That on the latter sum your Petitioners, when
ast work, would consider themselves consigned to clover, whilst on the
ormer they can hardly regard themselves as being turned out to grass.
That your Petitioners have each a trying daily walk, wherein they are
anxious to keep to the path of rectitude, but, by reason of their insuf-
ficient wages, they are sorely and grievously tempted to deviate from
that way; not only Letters, but Notts, and not only Notes, but
Money, passing to a large amount through your Petitioners' hands:
they thus having, as Postmen, the strongest inducements to desert the
Post of Honour.
That your Petitioners are often the bearers of a billet-dour, un-
consciously; but that the billet of which they are conscious-their
situation, or lot—is a very hard billet.
Your Petitioners most earnestly pray your Honourable House to
take the subject of their great responsibilities and small stipends into
consideration; to raise their superannuation scale to a temperate
degree above zero, and, generally, to elevate into something like a
human figure their present monkey's allowance.
And Your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever Knock.

a good lashing, between the shoulders with a bunch of the Carduus
benedictus, or Blessed Thistle, every morning. By perseverance in all
these methods of counter-irritation, I doubt not that you will be cured
of your heretical disorder, in the end.
"...But, my very dear Sir, I now address you principally in reference
to that extraordinary delusiou which may be termed ABADDon's Last;
his fiction of the alleged MADIAI case at Florence. You saw the º:
from the Vice President and Secretary of the Heretical Confederation
of Geneva to the EARL or SHAFTESBURY, which his lordship published
in the newspapers; and in this document you read the following
passage:
“‘FaàNCIsco and Rosa MAD1A1, at the age of 50 years, condemned for the sole cause
of the gospel to four H. at the galleys, repulsed by their Prince on their appeal for
mercy, their hair shaved by the hand of the gaoler, and clothed in the dress of
criminals, have just been sent to the Maremme, and are now undergoing their sentence
in the midst of malefactors.”
‘You will recollect that the crime for which the MADIAI were
stated, the other day, in the Times, to have been thus sentenced, was
‘the abandonment of the Communion of the Romish Church,” and the
following, of the ‘puro Evangelo’—pure Gospel—need I say, two
incompatible things?
“Qh! my very dear Sir, if oppression like this were perpetrated at
the instance, or eyen with the sanction, of our Church, you might
indeed justly regard us as enemies of the human race. As łºś
might you refuse to let us develop our system as restrain the Thugs
from carrying out theirs. If tyranny were an element in our religious
scheme, we might as well be suffered to make any other crime or
atrocity a #. of our religion: felony, ". reception of stolen
goods, swindling, smuggling, poaching, and thim ſeriº. "You would be

| All these, and your Puseyite clergy, who pave—with the very best
intentions—the way to our church doors, would be so many political
and social pests, to be hissed, if not kicked, out of all honest society.
“But now for the Truth. Alas! my very dear Sir, it is, in the first

anger is threatened to human liberty. The freedom of mankind is
menaced by that debasing despotism, calling itself a faith, of which the
supreme Head is MR. SUMNER. This bºº and intolerant pseudo-

a splendid cathedral, he drives out CARDINAL WISEMAN to the suburban
slums, there to celebrate our sacred mysteries in a hayloft situated
over a piggery !
| “As to the Archfiend's fabrication with reference to the MADIAI, it is
| simply an enormous flam º the reverse of the fact. You, my
very dear Sir, may hesitate to believe so tremendous an imposture
possible. You may suspect us to be insane for asserting it. Yes; and
undoubtedly when two parties differ as to the question whether a
picture winked or not, one of the two must be out of their senses. But
âh! ice are not mad; and I, in the full possession of reason, repeat
that the story of the MADIAI is the exact contrary of the actual affair.
The Deceiver has shifted the scene to Florence, and transformed two
English confessors into Tuscans. The real victims were no other than

working in the hulks; and his fair and high-born disciple has been sent

their beads !-Oh the organised oppression, miscalled a Church, that can

I have (assisted by a scientific friend) made a minute investigation

THE LAST LOVE OF FRANCE.
T is wonderful to find how much
love for Louis NAPO-
LEoN has been bottled up
in the hearts of French-
men for the last five-and-
twenty years without
their being aware of it.
Nobody would have sus-
pected that there was
such a large stock of the
essence of parfait amour
lying all over France for
consignment to the hero
who was driven off to cap-
tivity twelve years ago
in a Boulogne bathing
machine. Louis NAPO-
LEoN may well say to
the French, in the words
of the Irish songster—
“It was all very well to dissemble your love;
But why did you kick me down stairs?”
or rather—"why did you kick me up stairs?” for they bundled him
up to the prison in the upper town without ceremony, when he made
his celebrated “descent” on the coast, with his Champagne, his
sham soldiers, and his real eagle, from the rocky mountains of the
Colosseum.
The French have certainly a singular knack of “never, telling their
love,” wºn it might be of some service to the object of their secret
affection, and reserving the avowal of their sentiments till a period
when what they think is a matter of perfect indifference.
There is something quite romantic in the discovery that the French
have been during the Bourbon and Orleans dynasties secretly in love, for
the last seventeen years, with the man whom they have been alternately
incarcerating and sneering at during the whole of that period. Perhaps,
as “concealment like a worm in the bud” is the usual concomitant of
French affection, and it professes attachment openly to one object
while secretly loving another, we may find hereafter the feelings of
France to have been engaged in some other quarter when her protesta.
tions of love for i.º.º. were at their hottest. We suspect
that “the lady does profess too much" already, to be quite free
from suspicion, and Louis NAPOLEoN shows how jealous he is of he',
by trusting her as little as possible, and allowing her no liberty
whatever,
While Louis NAPOLEoN was at Lyons, we are told by the report
that
“A triumphal arch, painted in the Prince's colours, was raised in the middle of the
quay, near the slaughter-house.”
The propinquity of the arch to the slaughter-house was not inappro-
priate, ...] as the French would say, “the fact was significant.” The
ſºns of the incident is still further enforced by the announcement
that
“The garrison, consisting of 15,000 men, was drawn up in order of battle on the
Place de la Charité (a pretty spºt truly for battle array), the Cavalry resting on the
Place de Prefecture, the Artillery with their guns on the Place Bellecour, the Pugineers
in the streets opposite the Place, the Infantry and the Chasseurs of Vincennes in double
files in the streets through which the PRESIDENT was to pass.”
When we hear so much of the love expressed by the people for Louis
NAPoleon, in connection with these military arrangements for
keeping their enthusiasm within limits, we are reminded of the
exclamation of the stage fiend, “You must learn to love me—ha! haſ”
and cannot help drawing a rºle between the hero of the Boulogne
Champagne and the Bottle Imp.
The Best Screw Propeller.
THE most efficient screw propeller, and the one which has rendered
the greatest service to the vessel of the State, has certainly been MR.

ment to give the next ship that is fitted up on that economic principle
the name of the Honourable Member for Montrose.

WHAT DIVIDES THE SExES p-A RAZOR.
“YEs, Mr. Punch, that is now my established opinion. I have read
the Times; and have digested the various assertions and arguments
therein given in short at the great Female Convention, held at Syracuse.
I have studied the opinions as laid down by those gifted women—(if
they will pardon me º; them such, until a bran-new and a much
better name is invented for them)—and believing them equal in all
things to us, I am convinced that the only difference between the sexes
is, men shave, women do not. In fact, the only distinction between
man and wife is—a razor.
“I am a married man, Mr. Punch, and my name is Chuck, Rufus
CHUck. I must own, too, that on a perusal of the Times article, I did
feel a touch-just a touch—of remorse. The fact is, I am afraidi
have been a tyrant. A long and most familiar assertion and complaint
of Mrs. CHUck is, in her own affecting language, that she has been
crushed. She will often observe—"From the first hour of my mar -
I have been crushed.” If I venture to look remonstrance, she adds,
witheringly—‘And you know it. CHUck, you know it.”
“Well, Mr. Punch, having read the arguments of the Convention at
Syracuse, I am convinced, subdued, ashamed of my position as one of
the tyrants, man. The fact is, we have too long had it all our own
way—too long been uppermost. It is quite time that women should
assert themselves, and snatch the rod of iron from our hands. We have,
I fear, been tyrants because they have been willing victims; not but
what the wife of my bosom (if she will pardon the weakness of the
expression,) has more than once anticipated the energy of MRs. J.
Elizabeth Jones, of Ohio, and has not always been “in the habit of
talking much about women's rights.” She, too, has been one of those
women who, instead of talking about rights, “took 'em, without saying
anything about 'em.” Yes, I think I can say as much-now and then
—for the energy of MRs. CHUck. -
“When I wedded MRs. C.— (thirty years ago, Sir, she was white
and pink and delicate as Dresden china, with a little foot that might
have stood tiptoe on a daisy, and a figure that—but let me proceed)–
well, when I wedded MRs. Chuck, the marriage service would hardly
melt in her mouth, and now—“but there are wrongs,'—I quote her
words, Mr. Punch—“that would melt a poker.” -
“But, Mr. Punch, let men and women come to a fair adjustment,
We have had our way for a few thousand years, let the women have
their turn. We resign the sceptre into their hands: we kneel and do
homage. Let us, as men, retire into the violet shade of life, and let
women ‘rule the court, the camp, the grove.’ Let us, as men, forego
the brutality of authority, and, giving up our places, study to be humble
and useful.
“Fortunately we (if the we is still to be admissible; but in the new
holy divided state, I presume it will run I and he] have no little chil-
dren; because, though I have domestic talents, ldon’t think Ishould be
good at nursing. To get a baby on its first feet would, I think, perplex
me; neither could I' change ’em,” as I think it's called—but {{...,
wish to . with diffidence) I have an eye and something of a hand
for housekeeping: so have many married men of my acquaintance. I
have twice in my life—when absent from MRs. Chuck—put a button
on my shirt: once for a wager—when MRs. C. was at Margate—stuffed
a goose, roasted it, made the gravy and compounded the apple-sauce.
I assure you the jolly dogs—(I mean the despicable tyrants, for they
were all married)—who dined with me, voted it excellent; and after:
wards said as much to MRs. Chuck, who, I remember, replied—‘Of
course, yes; that was always how she was crushed.”
“And surely, Mr. Punch, there are men who may—with common
energy—learn to make tea: to do crochet work: to get up fine linen:
to do everything in fact that hitherto has been most crushingly heaped
upon women. At all events, I say, in common fairness let us try.
“Let all our sailors be discharged, and the sailors' wives—(of course
they must allow us, I speak for our sex, their half-pay)-man, that is,
woman our navy. Let the army be disbanded, and the Connaught
Amazons i.º. place of the Rangers, and the Sharptalkers that of
the Sharpshooters.
“I don’t care much about it, but I suppose when they take posses-
sion of the houses of Parliament, they’ll let us have our gallery,
where we may bring our work. - -
“Anyway, Mr. Punch, let us resign. Man and wife have too long
been one—‘the man being all the One, and the woman being Nothing"
—as MRs. C. once observed when she was crushed—henceforth let
them be Two: an independent Two, in this manner:

town, and he proceeded to Frowningdown Castle. We learned, on
arriving last Monday, that the nomination for the borough was #xed

out some fellow I knew—or knew his cousin, or his yacht, or discovered
some other basis of friendship—and should have plunged into the fun;

“Suddenly MR. KINGsilver came into my room in a great hurry
took the book out of my hands, and pointed impatiently to my hat and
gloves. I knew his way too well to be surprised, and in three minutes
we were in a carriage with the MACHICOLLATION arms on it, hastening
to the Castle. -
“‘Old BROMpton (he meant your admirable papa, love) says you can
speak very well. , You ain't hoarse, to day, I hope,” said M.R. KING-
silver, who was blinking with his eyes, and pulling at his nose, in a most
impatient manner. “I say,’ he said, after a pause, during which I was
puzzling at his meaning; “I say,’ he added most earnestly, ‘Give it
well in about moderate reforms, and hit hard at the Ecclesiastical
Courts—they’ve no friends. I don't see that you should commit your-
self to much.”
“I was still staring, when the Castle horses, which had stept out
splendidly, rattled us over a paved court-yard, and ZACHARY would
hardly wait for the door being opened before tumbling out and pulling
me with him through a gloomy hall, and into a grim old library (haunted,
I'm certain), and then he stamped because no one was there, and rang
the bell vehemently.
*** Where’s the £an ? •
“‘Haddressing the folks in the juiced yard, Sir," said the servant.
“‘Old fool,” I could hear ZACH. mutter, and perhaps he even put
the sentiment a trifle stronger. “Come on, ALBANY, can't you?”
“Through the Castle, and into the joust-yard we hurried, and there
we found long tables in the open air, and perhaps a couple of hundred
men, tenants of the Earl, banging the tables furiously, while the LoRD
of MACHIcollation was haranguing them. Oh, WIoI.ET' what rubbish
the old fellow was saying; but his fine head, white hair, and soldierly
manner helped it wonderfully.
“‘Take him easy,” said MR. KINGSILVER to me, still bringing
me on towards the Earl. “Say something about Portcullis's legs,
however.”
“‘What's the matter with his legs, except that one's as bandy as the
other?” I asked ; for I remembered the Wiscount in France. He used
to pester poor Dominique, at the Cafè de Paris, by inventing wild-
sounding dishes—such as (Eillades de Locofoco (vert) aur catafalques ana-
baptistes, and nonsense of that kind.
“‘Accident—railway—no chance of taking his seat, all our men

“The old Earl came forward, and welcomed me with a sort of stately
cordiality by no means out of keeping with the whole scene. He paid
me some gracious compliments, hoped that our acquaintance would be
long and intimate, and presented me to the assembly as the gentleman
of whom he had been speaking. - -
“‘You know, gentlemen,” he said, in such a sonorous voice and with
such a frank smile, that the humbug really seemed all right, ‘that I
never presume to dictate to my tenantry, or to interfere in their
elections, beyond taking that interest which a friend must take in his
friend's affairs. But I own it would console me much under the
painful circumstances which for the º exclude my son, Wiscount
Portcullis, from Parliament, should your free and unbiassed choice

must have been about the right thing to say. The nomination took
place yesterday, and there was a great fight round the hustings, and a
dashing charge of mounted farmers—the º is full of the wounded

And that is nearly all I have to say. Dear ALBANY made a beautiful
speech at the banquet, and introduced an allusion to “bright eyes,”
which the provincial ladies thought they understood, but which was
better appreciated by somebody else who read it to her papa from the
Pocketburgh Herald. And then the new Member came to town, and
had a not very long, but I think a very satisfactory interview with papa,
with whom, by a curious coincidence, MR. KINGSILVER (a dear old
man, though odd) had been closeted for some time. Miss Violet was
also requested to join the council, and various questions were discussed,
but few differences of opinion arose. Only one point ALBANY urged,
and, whatever I may have said, I thought his arguments were proper
and forcible. He pººl. that as he should wish to devote much
time to the study of the questions likely to arise in Parliament, it
would be well that all other matters should be disposed of as speedily
as possible, so that his mind might be in the calm condition desirable in
the case of a statesman. Papa remarked, that if he had one quality
more than another largely developed, it was patriotism, and for the sake
of his country he assented to ALBANY's proposition; and MR. KING-
silver concurring, and promising early parchments, Miss Violet was
requested to appoint her wedding-day—and did.
A HAPPY RELEASE.
- ------- EING very tender-hearted,
we are not in the habit of
looking forward with any
particular pleasure to the
approaching end of a fellow-
creature, but we must con-
ſess that we anticipate with
some satisfaction the early
official death of a class
of functionaries who are
doomed by a recent act of
Parliament. A late statute
ives power to the LoRD
XHANCELLOR to extinguish
the Masters in Chancery,
but the friends of humanity
will be glad to hear that
the process will be one of
utterly painless extinction,
as full salaries will be
attached to their annihi-
lated condition. The act
of terminating the existence
of these officials is deli-
cately described as “re-
leasing them;” and, indeed,
it will be a “happy release”
-- - - - for the Masters themselves,
while it will_put a vast number of suitors out of their misery in a
still more effectual manner. MASTERs FARRER and BRough AM, as
two of the old Masters, are doomed to official death on, the first
day of next term, which will bring with it the term of their joint
and several administrative existences. The legal massacre of the
Masters will then proceed in due course, until their total, extermina:
tion is effected. Their death-warrants will be issued to all in turn, and
all are prepared to meet their fate with cheerfulness. Dulce et decorum
est º: tºº mori is a motto that might be fairly assumed by any
One Of them,
As Unlike as Chalk and Cheese.
It is a common observation to hear, “Oh they are as different as
Chalk is from Cheese.” Now, the difference between these two articles
of commerce is not so great as persons may foolishly imagine. We all
know that Chalk enters largely into the composition of milk, and we
also yery well know that Cheese is made from milk. Accordingly, it
stands, to reason that, instead of there being any violent difference
there is, on the contrary, a strong resemblance between Chalk an
Cheese. They are both members of the celebrated Casein family.
Hope for Ireland yet!
MR. BRIGHT has been in Ireland for some days, studying for himself
the state of the rural population.
A rumour spread through Dublin on Monday that DR, CAHILL had
sailed from the Irish coast for Australia.
..If the Doctor really has left Ireland,...we only hope his departure,
ike MR. BRIGHT's arrival, is “for good.”
THE RAILWAY NURSERY RHYMER.
Now that it has become proverbial that accidents will happen on the
best regulated Railways, we consider that a salutary dread of them
ought early to be implanted in, the minds of our rising generation.
The infantine “hobgoblin.” should in future be the Railway Engine,
and our children should be legendarily warned of this, as cf a lawyer's
bill, or any other sometimes necessary evil. Instead of the bloody
deeds of mythic Jack-the-Giant-Killers, we would have our nursemaids
tell the horrors of a real Railroad journey. “Railways are Dangerous.”
should be the earliest round-hand text: and one of the first chapters in
the Spelling-book the Chapter ºf Accidents.
Our “Nursery Rhymers” too, might similarly be amended. . We
have long been nationally ashamed of those senseless “ *% babys,”
with which the British infancy has for ages been insulted. ith easy
alteration they might teach a most impressive lesson. And we, there-
fore, feel we shall be doing the infant state some service, by furnishing
at once a specimen page of The Railway Nursery Rhymer.
AIR.—“Ride a Cock-Horse.”
Fly by steam-force the country across,
Faster than jockey outside a race-horse:
With time-bills mismanaged, fast trains after slow,
You shall have danger wherever you go.
AIR.—“Little Bo-Peep.”
Little Bo-peep
Is fast asleep,
In th' Excursion train you’ll find him:
Oh! it’s ten to one
If he ever gets home—
For a “Special” is close behind him
AIR.—" Hush-a-by Baby.”
Rock away, passenger, in the third class,
When your train shunts a faster will pass;
When your train’s late your chances are small-
Crushed will be carriages, engine, and all.
AIR.—“Dickory, Dickory, Dock.”
Smashery, mashery, crash!
Into the “Goods” we dash:
The “Express,” we find,
Is just behind—
Smashery, mashery, crash!
TALE OF A TIGHT GARTER.
ONCE upon a time there was a garter, a wonderſul garter with
“Honi soil qui mal y pense” burning in it, as though, written in
sunlight. And this garter was for many years worn by a mighty leg-a
leg that was one of the pillars—and such an iron, adamantine pillar!-
of the land. But at length the leg reposed in dust; and the garter that
had circled that leg was to be given to another-given to the worthiest.
And the garter was given; it became the garter of another leg. And
folkslaughed bitterly and cried that that garter-above all
the ... º ; . i. § ºf ; º would—it must
the shoe, and ha e soiled in the dust.
And the hiº. altogether contrary to what folks had
prophesied. For the garter upon that leg-as, though the garter
had life in it—grew tight about the leg, tight and tighter: and, with
every step the leg took, the garter took a new grip; nevertheless the
leg would not give up the garter. For the man, who wore the garter
in his vanity thought the better of his leg. “What a great man I
must be that my leg should be even too big for such a gartºr! But it
is no doubt ever thus: great garters make fl. legs.” And though
pinched and pinched every time he wore the garter, nevertheless—
sweet and sustaining is conceit—he still wore the garter.

The Continental Tour of Cardinal Wiseman.
On Monday week. CARDINAL WISEMAN presided over aw;
ceremony at Cambrai, to inaugurate a miraculous statue of the Virgin,
stated to have caught larks in its mouth upon the occasion of a famine.
He also headed a procession of another miraculous picture of the Virgin,
of which the tradition is, that it would shut its eyes and whistle when-
ever a heretic went by. At Walenciennes he was leased to accept
a locket, containing a lock of hair that is recorded to have been cut off
SAMson's head by DALILAH, and he was also shown the scissors with
which the operation was performed. What makes the preservation of
the latter relic stillmore miraculous is, that it has retaine to the present
day the mark stamped upon one of its blades. That mark is distinctly
“SHEFFIELD.”

A HUMAN ORCHESTRA.
HeARING that an entertainment was to be presented, at the St.
James's Theatre, by an orchestra of human beings without anything to
play upon, except the natural curiosity of the public, we hastened to
assist at the inauguration of such a novelty. Nothing was said as to
the nation to which the members of this enterprising band belonged,
and we naturally concluded they were French, as the French seem to
have sunk into the mere instruments of their present director.
When the curtain ascended, a gentleman came forward to say a few
words on the splendid science of ventriloquism, and illustrated it by
asking “JIM’ if he was up there,” and receiving a reply from JIM
that he was “down here" in the º. ventriloquial fashion. As
a further proof of what science had done for the human voice, he
caught an imaginary bee in the palm of his hand, amid the usual amount
of “buzz” that attends that interesting exploit.
Then came the Organophonic Band itself, represented by twelve
stalwart men in military uniforms, who writhed and screwed their
countenances into all sorts of shapts, including angles and triangles, in
imitation of the instruments of a full orchestra. "The trombone kept
up a perpetual snore, the human drum gave a series of staccato grunts,
and the cymbals kept up a succession of sneezes and shivers which
ave one a sort of confused idea of something between one of Coles's
heumatic Bands and a regular orchestra. Altogether, we were
amused, as we generally are by whatever MR. MITCHELL K. at
the St. James's Theatre; but, we confess we did not wait for the bag-
ipes, as the instrument is bad enough at His best, and our horror of a
uman wind-bag is almost as great as MR. CARLYLE could desire.
A very astonishing part of the performance was the facility with
which the human instruments, after twisting and curling their lips and
noses into all inconceivable shapes, were able to get the creases and
folds out of their countenances in two or three minutes. The most
remarkable feature of the whole affair was the prominent feature on
the face of the drum, who drew his nose up into his eye, and let it
down again with a facility that had a terrible fascination for the
assembled audience. We looked very hard at the whole party, and
felt we should have been doing them an act of charity to stare them
out of countenance; but, this we found impossible. To look at the
painful faces they made, these human instruments appeared like instru-
ments of torture; and it is perhaps in mercy, that they were only
advertised for a week, lest the Animals' Friends should interfere for
their protection.
“Ireland for the Irish."
We have always been told of the excessive love of the Irish for their
country, but the way in which thousands are leaving it every week is
a peculiar Irish method of proving it. If the emigration only continues
at its present rate, the cry of “Ireland for the Irish” will have, to be
it. for in a few years’ time there will not be an Irishman left in
the whole island... It will, then be, “Ireland for the French,”. or
“Ireland for the Yankees,” for we doubt if the English would stir a
spoon in the matter—they have had more than enough of Ireland
already.
The President–Pepin-and Charlemagne.
In one of the cities, the Imperial President was addressed as “Pops
Zach ARY addressed PEPIN LE BREF,” whom the President “resembled.”
A still greater resemblance—to use Woltaire's words-might have
been adopted. As thus, the Mayor might have solemnly said-
“President, you are like the sword of CHARLEMAGNE. You are long
and flat.”

TOPSY-TURWY.
(Being Verses by a Poor Man Puzzled.)
BILL Sykes's home was a cadger's ken,
With a sack for a pillow and shavings
for sheets:
He was never taught nothin' he don’t
know when,
His grand tour was the tramp and his
school was the streets.
BILL Sykes, at six, went out on the lurk
Among the barges, as mud-lark and
raker;
BILL SYKEs, at ten, was advanced to
work
As covering boy to an old cly-faker.
With higher ambition BILL Sykes he
burned,
And, becoming experter as he grew
Older,
From cly-faking to crib-cracking turned,
And *...* the jemmy no cove was
Older.
The law to BILL Sykes was a thing to break-
The world to BILL SYKEs was a place to prig in-
What came in his way he would stoop to take,
But he scorned to beg, and he couldn't stand diggin'.
And so BILL Sykes took the world as it wagged,
In blissful confusion of “your’n’ and “his'n,”
Till in course of things BILL SYKes was lagged,
Tried, sentenced, and sent to a model prison.
In prison BILL SYKes's hair was cut,
He was neatly dressed in gray and yellow;
To an excellent school he was instantly put,
Well-fed, and clean-lodged—the #; fellow !
And after a year thus spent at his ease,
Fed, lodged, and clad at the cost of the nation,
They sent him to Portland to sniff the sea-breeze,
And complete his industrial education.
And when he had learnt to hammer and chip
Like a stone-mason born, in the Portland quarries,
They put him on board a Government ship,
And off to Australia BILL SYKes they carries.
And then, when arrived in Botany Bay,
With his ticket of leave, of grub he lands full–
If he chooses to hire, it's ten shillin' a day,
If he chooses to dig, it’s gold in handsfull.
Now making allowance for prison rules,
Uncommon pleasant, I think, his fate is—
Schooled, fed, and lodged, taught the use of his tools,
And at last shipped off to the Gold Diggins gratis.
And now that we’ve shown, by BILL Sykes's fate,
How Government treats a blind’un and bolter—
Pray listen, while I attempt to state
The story of hard-working, honest GILEs Jolt ER.
GILes Jolter saw light in a Dorsetshire cot,
Through whose walls and roof wind and rain did rattle:
He was one of six, and the room for the lot
Was a place where you’d not have housed your cattle.
OLD JoltER slaved that Giles might learn,
Though it pinched his meals and stinted his sleeping;
And there was a shillin' a week to earn
At pickin' up stones, besides cow-keeping.
At sixteen GILEs to farm work went,
For his arms were strong and his heart was willing;
From day-light to dark his back was bent,
And his weekly earnin's they was six shilling.
In course of time GILEs took a wife,
(For e'en Jolters wictims to CUPID's wiles is,)
And then came the desperates le for life,
With a gradual increase of little GILESEs.
From morningtide till evensong-
Hail, rain, or snow, whate'er the weather-
The whole year º: or sick or strong,
Husband and wife must toil together.
Their clothes was old, but they must wear-
Their meat was scant, but it must serve them;
On parish bread they scorned to fare,
So against hunger pride did nerve them.
So toiling, moiling, slaving still,
From dark to-day to dull to-morrow,
They struggled manful with each ill
That can steep poor folk's life in sorrow.
But honest GILEs bore up through all–
Ne'er took to stealing sheep, or poaching;
Though from the Union seemed to fall
A shadow, evermore approaching:
When mews was brought, how there were lands,
Where on the other side the Ocean,
Work was more plentiful than hands—
Which set GILEs Jolter's mind in motion.
“Lord, Lord!” said GILEs, “could we but get
A lift to that there happy island!”
“Ah!” sighed his wife-though doubtful yet
How she could bear to leave the dry land.
At length GILEs heard about a Board—
Commissioners of Emigration-
Charged a free passage to afford
For labourers, to this blesséd station.
GILEs got an application made
By help of an enlightened neighbour,
Was call'd to town—flung down his s
Half sad, half glad to leave his labour.
He trudged to Park Street: in the hall
...; his heels four hours they kept him ;
Then told him, six weeks hence to call,
And then they'd see if they could accept him.
With heart of lead poor GILEs return’d—
Heart that had been light as a feather:
And by odd jobs, for two months earn’d
What just kept life and soul together.
To Park Street then he trudged once more,
In hopes his prayer would now be granted:
Waited—was call’d—but shown the door,
As “No more labourers were wanted!”
So JoltER still, on Dorset leas.
With wife and little ones is pining;
While BILL Sykes at the Antipodes,
His pouch with virgin gold is lining.
MORAL.
Labourers as wage and wittles likes,
Unto a jemmy turn the coulter-
If you'd dig nuggets with BILL SYKes,
Ånd not potatoes with GILEs Jolter.

THE PRESIDENT'S PROGRESS.
(Being an Appendia to the Pilgrim's Ditto.)
AND Lo! On my way I came to a fair city, and
outside the gates thereof was gathered a great
multitude, and Lord Lickspittle, the Prefect of the
place at their head, and Captain Brute-Force, the
commander of the garrison, on a great horse; and
the chief councillors, Easy-Man, Turn with tie.
Wind, Out-at-Elbows, and Worldly-Mind, and a
great multitude of soldiers with them.
And I asked one of the soldiers, who seemed
. with drink, what this great gathering might
Or.
And he told me, with much thickness of speech
because of his potting, that it was because of the
| Prince President Apollyon that came that way.
Then I asked him what manner of man was this
Prince President, that the great men thus came
out to meet him. And he told me how he had,
once upon a time, saved the country from a great
red giant Grim gibber. And I asked him who had
seen that giant, and where he dwelt? But he told
me that no one had seen him, nor knew well, of a
surety, where he dwelt; but that, past a doubt,
he was an awful giant and a fell, and was to have
come in this year and slain men and women and
children, and spoiled their goods, and put divers
in prison and others driven over seas, but the
Prince President had fought with him and
mastered him, and so saved the country.
Whereupon I asked him in what manner the Prince President had fought with this fell
giant, when no one had seen, him, nor could 'arely tell what ſorm he was off This he wist
not aright, but, nevertheless, he told me hoº, that the Prince President had truly conquered
him; and, to that end, had in that city ...lain many thousands, both men and women, and
children, and had taken the goods of the Princes of the land, and put many thousands in
prison, and more banished. - - -
And I pondered much; for methought the Giant, Grim gibber, if he had come among
them, could but have done the same. Nathless I, held, my peace, lest they should smite me:
Then I heard Lord Lickspittle cry with a loud voice, “Lo! here cometh, my Lord. Shout!”
Captain Brute-Force called also to the people in like manner. But they spoke not a
word, save Easy. Man, and Turn-with-the-Wind, and Out-at-Elbows, and Worldly-Mind, who
shouted till their throats were hoarse. -
Then I saw the Prince Apollyon come riding; and Lord Lickspittle bowed down before
him and licked the dust, and Captain Brute-Force put his neck under his foot, and Easy
º
º ºveſ. Sawtar,
ºl, fºunct!
Man, and Turn-with-the-Wind, and Out-at-Elbows, and Worldly-Mind wept for joy and be:
slavered his legs, and shouted, “Long live Apollyon the Great, that slew the great Giant
Grim vibber, and saved the land.”
But when Lord Lickspittle saw that the people
said not a word—as in truth they had more of a
mind to curse the Prince, thinking of their
friends, and wives, and children that he had
slain, and banished, and put in stinking holds—
he was at his wit’s end, and wot not what to do.
Then there came one Outward-Show, that was
a mountebank and a rare trickster, and had de-
vised a certain motion of puppets such that,
when he pulled the wires, would wag their legs,
and arms, and heads; and among them was a
motion of young girls that came forth and strewed
flowers, and danced after the fashion of real
maidens; and Outward-Show blew with a trumpet
before them, and said:—
“Behold, our maidens come out to strew
flowers before the great Prince Apollyon /*
And Lord Lickspittle was well pleased, and gave
Outward-Show certain pieces of silver that con-
tented him marvellously, for he was a poor knave
and a shifty, for all his witty devices.

all this in their books, that it might be believed
in far countries how that all in that city loved
the Prince Apollyon. But, in truth, all this re-
joicing came but from the Lord Lickspittle, and
Captain Brute-Force and his drunken troopers,

PUNCH, OR
THE LONDON CHARIVARI. J63
ATROCIOUS ATTACK ON A BADGER.
QUB susceptible readers--we thereby mean, the sym-
pathetic million—may have learned with a º; horror
the cowardly, the unmanly attack that within these few days
has been committed on an unoffending, unsuspicious badger
—the badger at the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park.
The innocent animal was seized upon in a confiding moment,
and its mouth forcibly opened by two “gentlemen,” as
they called themselves at the Police Office: a quantity of
loathsome gin—burning, blighting, bluely-ruining gin was
thus insidiously forced into the animal's stomach. SHAKE-
speaRE, when he would give the most touching picture
of infant helplessness, speaks of the babe sent away with
“the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth.” Some-
thing of this sort will, of course, arise to the imagination
of the reader, when he thinks of the destructive fluid in
the innocent stomach of the badger.
heard of the atrocious act, he took his hat and cane, and
drove to the Gardens. Toby was at first stopped at the
gate; “No dogs being admitted.” Mr. Punch, however,
cannot but acknowledge the courtesy that waved the
rule in favour of Toby, he being, in the words of the
official, a dog sui generis ; or a dog by himself—which
being interpreted to Toby, that gifted animal unders
to be a dog in a state of celibacy—upon which Toby howled
accordingly. But we are forgetting the badger.
We were speedily ushered into the presence of the
sufferer, and found that an ape—an ape of long-known,
though rarely-practised skill—had been called in. At the
very time the Doctor was with his patient. We say—
Doctor: for in the thoughtful lines of the ape's counte-
nance, especially about the nose, we distinctly traced the
letters, F.R.C.S. The badger looked a little pale: but we
have heard of badgers—like a lover of the Minerva Press
—overdrawn; and on the whole, thought the badger had
very likely suffered less from the fire-water internally taken,
than it might have done from the teeth of badger-worrying
terriers.
Having sympathetically surveyed the sufferer, and dropt
our one tear—the smallest offering to wounded sensibility
—we retired, the º: acknowledging our bow with a severe
yet withal dignified gravity that would have graced a Court
F." (no insinuation, SIR JAMEs CLARK, upon our
onour). Before we left the Gardens, we were obligingly
presented with a copy of the Doctor's bulletin, as inter.
preted by the Æsop of the establishment (he was, years
since, we have heard, the Poet of Cremorne), and by him
fixed on paper. Here it is:—
“2 P.M. Found patient in a paroxysm of pain: doubled
up like a hedgehog; and his best badger hair, that kings
might have shaved with, sharp and rigid. Called in help,
and unrolled him. Eyes fixed-pupils much dilated—pulse
120-very high, indeed, for a badger.
“Raved wildly : cried out that the dogs were at him, but
he wouldn't be drawed as he had been, no, not for the best
nobleman in the landſ Evidently alluding to the festive
*cenes of former years.
"Ordered patient to be pumped over: howled again, and
said he preſerted hot, with sugar. Pulse falling. Ordered
ten Teetotal Tracts, with treacle and butter, to be given as
pills. . Couldn't get ’em down patient's throat. Called in
one of the pelicans; deposited 'em in the very inside pit of
badger's stomach, which—rejected 'em.
“3 P. M. Administered, in dove's milk, powder of scraper
: ºte: Hall. Badger ſell into profound sleep—snoring
eavily.
“5 P.M. Woke, weak, but not refreshed. Prescribed a
slight stimulaut. . Decoction of juniper-leaves, hot wi
honey. Slept again.
.“7 P. M. Woke, a little languid, but sensible. Asked
him how he had liked hit last prescription. Upon which,
with a light in his laughing eye, the badger made answer—
‘Werry nice, indeed; but not quite the thing.’ Slept
again.
“9 P.M.Woke at nine: smacked his lips. Asked him if
he could fancy anything; and if he could to name it. He
did name it—“GIN.”

THE FRENCH JACK SHEPPARD.
WE do not wish to be disrespectful to the French Nation, but Louis Napoleon
puts us strongly in mind of Jack SHEPPARD. He has been in prison—perhaps
not so often as his prototype; but still he has had his full share of imprisonments,
and, like JACK, he has always been successful in escaping. Then again, the coup
d'état of December the 2nd might pass almost for one of the ..º.º. exploits,
with the exception that JACK never perpetrated a burglary on so large a scale; At
the utmost he broke into a private house, when all the inmates were in bed, and
stole the plate. He had never an opportunity of breaking into a nation, and robbing
it of all its liberties in the dead of the night. That was a * reserved for the
nephew of an Emperor to lend his hand and crowbar to 1 But Jack's crowbar
was innocent enough: it had no stain of blood upon it. There the comparison
between him and the prison-escaping burglarious President, of France ends. To
push it any further would be injurious to our favourite Adelphi hero. Beyond a
certain point, his dark lantern is completely put out by the superior darkness of
his rival's. In humiliating impartiality, we are pained to confess that France boasts
of a greater Jack SHEPPARD than we do. Louis NAPOLEON is, by the whole
length of the Boulevards, the greater man of the two. In the perſection of cool,
reckless burglary, MRs. KEELEy's beau idéal is no match for him
At present, the French Jack SHEPPARD is busy carving his name on the beam
which holds the future scales of France. Trat, name, we need not say, is
EMPEREUR. A nation must be blind, indeed, to keep any such beam in its eyeſ

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HINTS TO SERVANTS WHEN THE FAMILY
IS OUT OF TOWN.
OW is your time to examine
the state of your mistress's
- wardrobe.
If the gowns should fit
ou, and the bonnets are
ecoming, you may as well
wear them.
Should you invite a few
friends to tea, you receive
them in the drawing-room,
of course-providing al
ways the drawing-room is
in a fit state to receive
them.
The least you can do for
them when they leave, is
to ask the coachman to
see them home in the
carriage.
If any children are left at
home in your charge, you
should send them to bed
very early; or, supposing
any of them should be suffi-
ciently advanced to play
the piano, you may let her
stop up to play quadrilles
whilst you dance.
It is as well, however, not to let John NY smoke in their presence.
It is probable you may find these children the great drawbacks to
our enjoyment, so you must be very careful what you do before them.
hen you go out for a drive, you had better leave them at home;
when you play at cards you had better send them into another room;
when you wish to practise the pianº, you should send them out walking;
and if you expect any of the “military” to drop in during the evening,
you had better take the precaution of putting them to bed two or three
hours earlier. - -
As for their getting up in the ...; that is to be entirely regulated
by the hour at which you rise yourself. So, if you wish to read the
newspaper in bed, you needn't § yourself out on their account.
Besides, children like stopping in bed
If you have any leisure for reading, there are master's books; but,
should you prefer novels, you can easily send round for them to SAMs',
or the nearest circulating library. -
Never mind about º or butter-thumbing, or coffee-
spotting a book. It will never be known who has done it; and if you
wish to lend a book to a friend, why should you hesitate when the
books are not yours? To guard against accidents, make the borrowers
always promise to bring the books back again. -
You should not neglect this good opportunity—as you will naturally
have access, either by fair or foul means, to your mistress's drawers—to
have all her caps, and gowns, and “latest fashions,” correctly copied
by your milliner—(supposing you have not time to yourself)—so that
you may wear them in your mistress's presence when she comes back.
Eat and drink of the very best: have hot luncheons, hot dinners (of
course), and hot suppers, regularly every day—spare nothing—providing
always you are not left upon board wages. In the latter case, the case
is very different; but even then you can manage it, if you are clever,
with the different tradesmen, by telling them to charge what you con-
sume in the weekly bills, when “the family” returns to town. If the
tradesmen, like fools, object, you have your remedy—you can change
them for others who are more reasonable.
Your wine depends upon whether the butler drinks any himself. If
he does, he must give you some, or else threaten to expose him.
If the plate has been left out, as a matter of course you use it.
You needn’t work more than you like. You are your own mistress,
and the principle is to enjoy yourself, more especially as your enjoy.
ment only comes once a year. Accordingly you can go to the theatre
as often as you can afford it, and stop out as late as you please, so long
as you shut the door, after you. The only thing you have to guard
against is a surprise; but as “the family” is pretty sure to write home
word to tell you when they intend returning, there is not much fear of
any such accident. Then, providing the house is cleaned, a few of the
books put back, the piano not much out of tune, the curtains not
smelling of tobacco, the clothes all returned to where you took them
from, and the children properly subdued, by tremendous threats of
extermination, into silence, your master and mistress need not have
the slightest suspicion how you have been enjoying yourselves whilst
they have been out of town.
A RETIRED FLUNKEY.
RUNAWAY ENGINES.
- pounds for horses and donkeys seem to have gone
out of fashion. Their place, however, promises to be supplied with
railway pounds. According to the following extract:
“ANOTHER ENGINE CAPTURED.—On Saturday last another of the Great Northern
engines was impounded as a trespasser at the Nottingham Station by the Midland
authorities.—Sheffield Times,
it would seem that railway engines are as often in the habit of going
out of all bounds as railway directors themselves. . It would be curious
to hear, the town crier going round the district, crying a “Lost
Engine,” or giving notice, that if the engine which had strayed into
MR. So-AND-So's china shop was not taken away within so many days,
it would be sold to pay the expenses. This kind of straying, however, is
harmless, compared to the strºying and trespassing which railways
have lately been indulging in... We allude to one train straying out of
its direct course, and trespassing upon another. For these trespasses,
which, when connected with the loss of life, can never be forgiven, there
is no established pound, excepting such as a verdict gives in damages:
and what amount of pounds, we ask, can ever compensate for the loss of
a leg, or a couple of arms, or the death of a dear relative There will
be no security for the public until a Director is compelled, by Act of
Parliament, to travel in every train.

AN ELEGANT EXTRACT.
“My DEAR MR. Punch, October 8th, 1852.
“ALTHOUGH, unfortunately, I am one of the pig-eyed, bullet-
headed, long-backed, bad-legged, slavish, lumbering ons, I am a
humble admirer of truth when I meet with it, and hasten to corroborate
as far as it is in the power of such a pot-bellied sulky boor, the pro-
ſound remarks of the gentleman who so elegantly addresses the Times
of yesterday: What candid man, of any perception, will not recognise
at once, in the following feeble sketch,
WORKAOUSE
* The FLAT-FACED, small-BRAINED, prowling Anglo-Saxon.”
And who will not see at a glance that he does not possess the “cranial
capacity,” nor the “physical energy,” of the dominant race P. On the
other hand, can there be any one so blinded by dulness or prejudice, as
to dely that this is
* The TRUE Tipper ARY MAN who will feRRET. The saxon out of
Railways, coal Mines, &c.”
The question allows of no dispute. It is as clear as noon-day; and one
does not know which to admire most,-the correctness of MR. Mac
ELHERAN's observation, or the use he makes of it.
“I am, Sir, your humble Servant,
“AN Ill-MADE SAxon, with A MOP of
To – Punch, Esq. (a Celt, of course.) FLAX on HIs HEAD,”
T H E W E D D | N G M O RN | N G.
(ADDRESSED TO THE MARRIAGEABLE.)
Encouraged by the success which has attended the efforts of the
original devisers of the system, Mr. Punch respectfully announces to
the nobility, gentry, and (Protestant) clergy, and all other persons
likely or liable to marry, that he is about to open an establishment for
the supply of everything requisite and desirable at a Wedding.
He purposes to confide the providing the mere necessaries, as wines
of the rarest vintages, the breakfast, plate, china, servants, carriages,
and bride-cake, to the parties who habitually advertise their readiness
to undertake such provision, and who, so far as he knows, acquit
themselves with great credit. They will, of course, be ..º. to
i . subordinates in carrying out the scheme he is now about to
Submit.
The first startling novelty of Mr. Punch's system is, that he under-
takes to provide The Other Party. Any lady or gentleman, therefore,
who may have obtained her or his consent to be married, has merely
to write to Mr. Punch, ordering “the breakfast and the usual
accessories.”
If wished, one of Mr. Punch's young men will attend a º
desirous to be married, with #"...º. of Other Parties on hand.
The selected Party exchanged if not approved of, but, in the case of a
lady, not later than twelve o'clock, or if a gentleman, than six o'clock
on the day preceding that of the ceremony. Hair and teeth warranted,
but neither age nor temper. Any amount of certificates and testi-
monials, however, may be had as to any point, Mr. Punch having
º: several eminent Begging Letter Writºrs to manufacture these
o order.
Arrangements with the leading Ladies' Establishments in the metro-
polis, and suburbs, enable Mr. Punch to offer selections, from, an
assortment of the most charming Bridesmaids who ever cried before
an altar. Due regard will, , of course, be had in producing, or in
avoiding, contrast between a lady and her bridal attendants. A group
ºf old maids, with undeniable wigs, kept for occasions when younger
bridesmaids may be deemed undesirable. .
Several elegant3. gentlemen, with others of more mature years,
have been engaged, ºf will always be ready to enact the Bridegroom's
friends, brothers, cousins, school-fellows, or any other relations that
may be desired. (Parties finding their own plate need be under no
apprehension for their spoons, a policeman, disguised as a City uncle,
...}} accompanying the party.) Moustaches, or not, as may be
Ordered.
A, heavy Father, either for Bride, or Bridegroom, can be provided,
and he will be warranted to sob audibly at the ceremony, and, if wished,
to embrace the clergyman convulsively, and call for water in the vestry.
He will be furnished with a chastely pathetic speech for the breakfast.
A comic ſº will also be sent to return thanks for the brides-
maids, and Mr. Punch's connexion with the journal bearing his name
ls * warranty for this party being supplied with novel and discrett
Jokes.
Clergy ſurnished according to the views of the parties. Those of
the Clapham School entail a somewhat increased expense, on account
of their large consumption of the good things of the table, and a
Puseyite will also be charged extra, on account of the cost of the dress,
which can be used for no other person (except on the fifth of November);
but it is suggested that this official be left to Mr. Punch's selection, he
undertaking on no account to introduce an Irishman.
A Member of Parliament (with a speech), a family solicitor (clerk
with parchments perpetually in the way, extra), a Peer, a Baronet, a
Banker, or any other character which may be thought desirable to
enhance the éclat of the affair, will be supplied at the shortest notice.
Any number of foreign noblemen without additional charge, and with
orders, ribbons, and broken English complete.
Attached servants, of both sexes, who have known either Party, as
may be wished, since childhood, will be included, and will cry violently,
either in the hall, or when º coffee, or at any cue which may
be arranged. A white-headed old butler, with an agonized benediction
on his young master or mistress (whose father saved his life) may be
had, but as he is on the staff of a suburban theatre, this touching effect
must be arranged so as not to interfere with his hour for rehearsal
elsewhere. -
A fashionable milliner and a first-rate tailor, * in waiting.
Love-letters, as also letters of congratulation, with wedding presents
from distant friends, in constant readiness. Sentiments of such com-
munications inserted to order, and warranted to read well when
handed round.

The Turn of a Hair.
Those who are acquainted with the expensive habits of Louis
NApoleon, declare that he thinks less of the dignity of his present
position than the salary, and that he is only cultivating the imperial for
the sake of the tip.
A Ruinous Inheritance.
A DISTINGUISHED gourmand, upon being reproached about the large
sums of money he spent on the pleasures of the table, excused him-
self by saying, “It’s no fault of mine! My father was a great eater—my
mother was a great drinker, and I inherited largely from both.”
The Gold Fever—This fever is a remittent one, considering that
large sums of Gold are remitted every week.
A MAYOR'S “DAILY BREAD.”
Louis NApoleon continues his progress through France. The egg
is chipped, and the eagle is already º : the bees are beginning
to swarm, and in due season will alight upon the purple-bees, doubt-
less, full of honey from the historic lilies of France; although the lilies
are still in the shade. Nevertheless, Louis Napoleon marches towards
a throne—marches in a golden haze of purchased lying. Never was so
much false emotion got up at so great a cost-never did printer's ink
(government ink, be it remembered) reek with such falsehood. Honest
men stop their noses at the official histories of the triumph.
Everywhere, Mayors are on their bellies, licking the boots of
Napoleon—licking them like spaniels—as though there was the taste
of manna in the blacking. And the basest of all these is the Mayor of
a commune in the department of Hairault. Hear how the impious
dog yelps –
“Our Prince—You who are in power by right of birth, and by the acclamation of
the people, your name is everywhere glorified; may your reign come, and be perpe-
tuated by the immediate acceptance of the Imperial Crown of the great Napoleos;
may your firm and wise will be done in France, as abroad. Give us this day our daily
bread, by-"
We have given enough; and would, had we the power, assuredly
give to the Mayor daily bread, and after this fashion, for some ten days
or a week at least. In punishment of the impious rogue, we would
have his hands tied fast at his back; then we would have him laid
ently—very gently—within a few yards of a tolerably dirty gutter.
f. this gutter we would break up, in small morsels, a couple of
pounds of bread per diem—and this should be the “daily bread”
vouchsafed to the Mayor of Hainault. Of course he would have to
wriggle, and twist, and crawl towards the gutter, and then have to duck
for the fragments. But crawling and ducking are the Mayor's specialty;
and then for his reward, would be the “daily bread,” though not quite
of the sort he blasphemously prays for.
NAVAL COURTS-PARTIAL.
In political matters “things
equal to the same are”
not always “equal to
each other,” as may be
seen by a reference to
the recent Courts-Mar-
tial, where two offences,
as equal as possible to
each other, were visited
with sentences by no
means equal to the same,
or coming to the same
thing, but of very dif-
ferentdegrees of severity.
It is all very well, to
represent justice with a
air of scales, but there
is sometimes either
something very wrong about the weights that are used, or the
scales are not fairly balanced. At all events we think the scales in
which such apparently uneven justice as what we are about to describe
was weighed out, should be treated as defective, and dealt with accord-
ngly. -
#. the first case a sailing-master was absent without leave for eight
days, and in the second case a Lieutenant was absent without leave for
five days. In the first case the prisoner pleaded “amind upset by recent
family misfortunes,” while in the second case the prisoner's plea is not
given, but it could hardly have been stronger than the one already cited.
In each case, witnesses were called to the excellent character of the
accused, and the reader may probably anticipate about as much differ:
ence between the two sentences as there is between the five days and
eight days, during which the prisoners were respectively absent from
their duty. Now for the result.
In the first case, “the Court declared the charge partly proved, and
sentenced the prisoner to be dismissed from Her MAJEsty's service.”
In the second case, “The Court declared the charge to be fully proved,
and sentenced the prisoner to be severely reprimanded.” -
It would seem from this, that a charge partly proved is more serious
to the accused party than a charge thoroughly brought home to him,
and the weaker the evidence against a prisoner the stronger will be his
punishment. We are afraid there must be something wrong in the
scales, supplied for the use of Naval Courts-Martial. Perhaps the
same habit of bungling in the dock-yards, that frequently causes a new
ship to lean too much on one side, has affected the paraphernalia of
justice, and prevented her from weighing out with an even hand the
commodity she deals in.

SPECULATIVE SYMPATHY.
“MR. PUNCH,
“SoME little time since we had the misfortune to lose a
relative. A day or two afterwards arrived a letter, addressed in a
lady's hand, the stylish look and deep black-bordered envelope of which
made us think it was one of condolence. But it proved to be from
some linendrapers in Oxford Street, offering us their sincere sympathy,
º; jºins specimens of crape, &c., and a card of terms somewhat
as tollows :-
TO T H E B E R EAVE D.
---
MESSRS. GROGRAM AND TWILL
BEg to offer you their condolences upon your recent loss,
and to forward you, with assurances of their sympathy,
specimens selected from their large stock of Crapes,
Widows' Silks, Twills, &c.
O! Ye, whose hearts, half crushed beneath the blow
Of some sad loss, still struggle to be calm,
Receive, to soothe your unavailing woe,
Our crape and comfort, bombazeen and balm.
Taught, by our own, your sorrows to relieve,
Qur house, the cheapest in its sad sad line,
Sells, with an aching heart, to all who grieve,
Rich widows' silks, yard wide, at six-and-nine.
The heart, dear friends, of sunshine and of showers
Oft times an equal dispensation needs,
To ripen in it Virtue's fairest flowers;–
And we have got the newest mode for weeds.
Then murmur not, though with the last caress
f those you loved your aching brow still glows;
But humbly strive your sorrow to repress,
And take a pattern—such as we enclose.
Each day some loved one hastens to his end,
And from your grief few mortals may escape;—
And Paramatta's what we recommend,
For you will weep, and tears are bad for crape.
“The cock's shrill clarion and the sounding horn,
.No more shall wake them from their quiet bed,”
Tº poet tells; and if for this you mourn,
Try if our bugles will not do instead.
And oh! ye mourners; oh! ye weary hearts;
Dry the vain tear, and hush the loud lament:
One solace more our tender firm imparts,
For ready money it drops ten per cent.
“Sweet are the uses of Adversity,”
As SHAKSPEARE says. Ah! Had the bard but known
The use we make, he would have smiled to see
How far our knowledge had excelled his own. Dolor.”
FLUNKEYISM IN FRANCE.
FLUNKEYIsM has been rampant throughout the Presidential progress:
but we think Bordeaux has furnished the most glaring instance of it.
For we read in the Constitutionnel that—
"Pelegates have come to Paris expressly for the purpose of procuring the most
exact information as to the livery worn by the servants of the President; the
authorities of Bordeaux being anxious that those who wait upon the Prince during
his visit to that place should wear the same dress as his attendants at the Elysée."
Well, after all, it was but natural that the “authorities" should feel
a little “anxious” about the livery, seeing it was for their own wearing
they wanted it. For we doubt not they were first to “wait upon” the
Prince. , And indeed the mere fact of the delegation proved them
thorough “flunkeys.”
The Correction of a Vulgar Idea.
... It is not that literary men quarrel more than any other class of men:
# 18 º they have greater means of making their quarrels known to
ºne public.
ERRATUM FoE FRANCE:-At the end of certain addresses presented
THE EMPIRE OF BEADLEDOM.
ONG encouraged by events
“over the water,” , the
elected Beadle of one of our
arcades—we will not say
which—has struck a blow
whose aim is to plant the
staff of beadledom for ever
in his own family.
He has recently been
making a progress from the
north entrance to the south,
and the following are some
of the bulletins that have
reached us.
“Arcade, Number One.—
The Beadle has just gone
by the door of number one,
amidst cries a million times
repeated of Wive BUMBLE 2.
As he approached the shop
the master presented the
following address: , ‘We
hail you, Sir, as the legiti-
mate heir of the BUMBLEs.
The inhabitants, of this
Arcade feel that their hap-
#. is in your hands, typified by the staff that you grasp between
em.
“The Beadle was much moved by this touching proof of sympathy.
His health is excellent.”
“The Toy Shop.–The reception of his High Mightiness at the Toy
Shop was admirable. Young girls belonging to the establishment, and
dressed in Orleans cloth, came out to offer him a bouquet. The
Beadle seemed to be greatly affected by this mark of confidence. His
health continues excellent.”
“The China Warehouse.—His Highness has just drawn up at the
cheap China Warehouse, where a sort of º pile of breakfast
cups, jars, vases, and other objects of industry, has been raised to dº
him honour. The Beadle inspected the pile with much interest, and
astonished all present by his sage remarks on the mode in which the
chinaware had been heaped up. His observations struck every one
with the conviction of his being a first-rate engineer, and he left amid
a perfect storm of enthusiastic cries of Wive BUMBLE 2. His health
continues excellent.”
“Jewellery Mart—His High and Mightiness is now at the Jewellery
Mart, where the same enthusiasm follows him. He has just recognised
an old officer of the sheriff, who served under the Beadledom of his
uncle. He has given the officer three }; of copper amid frantic
: five million times repeated, of Wive BUMBLE 2. His health is
excellent.”
“Halfpast 6.-The Beadle has just returned from a visit to the
desk and tea-caddy showroom of the locality. At every turn he was
met by young girls, many of whom offered him bouquets. He after-
wards visited the stock and collar establishment, where he passed
under an inscription “To the Preserver of the Arcade and of family
Ties,” worked in silk cravats, stocks, and handkerchiefs. His High-
ness has just started for the toy bazaar, where he has promised to
accept the ball—a large foot-ball-prepared in his honour.”
It will be seen from the preceding reports that the Hereditary
Beadledom is only a question of time; and indeed it would have been
declared long since, but for the jealousy of neighbouring powers. The
Police Inspector on the beat adjoining, though he takes no step to
prevent what is going on, is evidently no indifferent spectator of the
events in progress. Should the independence of the Savoy be
threatened, the chief of that limited Beadledom will, no doubt, have
the sympathy and assistance that may be required for preserving his
authority, and keeping up the proper balance of power.
“The Boulevard du Crime.”
THE above is the name of that part of the Boulevards where most of
the melodramatic theatres are situate, and was so given on account of
the style of * which are generally performed there; but we think
that part of the Boulevards, where the massacres of last December
% place, has greater reason to be called now “Le Boulevard du
ime.”
JUSTICE AND CHARITY.-Justice is rightly painted blind. When
to Louis NAPOLEon, for “Amen” read “No men.”
begging-letter writers appeal, let charity be deaf.

SIR (HERCULES)
Before that the Bucolic Gods
Were lifted to their high abodes,
While yet on non-official earth
They walked as men of mortal birth,
The farmer's fate they would bewail—
Thrust from Protection's sacred pale-
And prove how 'twas with Legislators
Rested the price of corn and 'taturs:
How, were but law the farmer's friend,
Low prices and short crops must end;
And how on Ministers alone
The farmer's fate was justly thrown.
All this, at market-tables read,
Filled with high hopes each farmer's head;
On DeRBy sure they might depend,
And Dizzy was the farmer's friend.
Were they—the Free-trade powers defeated—
In Downing Street's Olympus seated,
The suffering farmer would have there
A power, accessible to prayer,
To help him in his sore distresses,
And extricate him from his messes:–
Tºrº -----
Thus farming oracles declared,
And this belief the farmer shared.
In vain the Free-trade powers that were
Tried to sel'-help such minds to stir-
Preached to them faith in work and will,
In science, energy, and skill-
Told them that he who seeks a friend,
Upon himself may best depend;
That if two quarters must be sold
At the same price one fetched of old,
As good a trade might still be done
By growing two in place of one.
Such preaching passed, like idle wind,
The prepossessed Bucolic mind,
Which still believed the powers above
Ruled farmers' fates in hate or love.
At length, down to the nether world
The Free-trade Deities were hurled,
And lo! Protection's Gods, on high,
Were throned in the official sky.
True devotees, in wild delight,
The farmers hailed the new-risen light:-
Something for Louis to Put in his Pipe.

FITZROY KELLY AND THE FARMER.
“Behold, now reign the farmer's friends,
And all our cruel suffering ends!
You told us oſt, while here below,
That 'twas from law our fate must flow ;
That Ministerial aid alone,
Could lift those up Free-trade had thrown :
“So now you reign, our friends on high,
Look down and help us from the sky.
Our prices raise, our produce double,
And help us out of all our trouble.”
“Unthinking men ' " a god replied—
('Twas HERCULEs, whom earth did hide
Under the form of FitzRoy Kelly)—
“How often do we need to tell ye
That, if you wish your woes to end,
Upon yourselves you must depend ?

The unistersal golden rule—

PUNCH ON THE PLAYHOUSE.
º HERE is a mournful feeling
ºn creeps over Punch in the
early days of October.
Whence is it — what its
cause? Is it the yellowing,
the º; October leaves?
In every leaf,
“Sylph or faery hither tending,
To this lower world descending,
Each invisible and mute
In his wavering parachute.”
(Somewhat like—and yet
how different l—to visible
MADAME PolTEVIN of the
Cremorne ascent and Fall?)
Is it, then, the contempla-
tion of the falling leaves—
the dropping hairs of the
a pensiveness to the bosom
of Punch P We think not :
we have pondered the
matter; it is not the
autumn leaves, but the
autumnal play-bills. Thea-
tres begin to open; and we
- sympathise with the feeling
of responsibility knocking at the heart of every manager. For
§. as he knows, is his trust—solemn and very solemn his duty.
*or is he not made, or at least appointed by an anxious and most moral
and most fastidious LORD CHAMBERLAIN, the teacher of the people in
their play-hours?—the pedagogue to instruct by loftiest sports—the
Dominus to drop into the open mouth and open heart of laughter, a
sweetening truth—the Teacher, to touch and refine by the “sacred
source” of tears, the sympathies and the affections of a docile and
affectionate public *
Great is the responsibility–tremendous the charge—and every
London manager—(and though we have no certain truths to go upon,
no doubt every manager civic and rustic also)—shows, especially at the
commencement of the winter season, the sense of the mighty duty it is
his happy mission to fulfil. You may know—especially about the fall
of the leaf-a London manager by the placid loftiness of his expression.
He is raised a little above the world º he may consider it from a
moral altitude, The future season, is marked in lines of thought
gliding, up and down his visage; lines indicative of many coming
play-bills, and, therefore, all lines of truth. On certain occasions his
eye will brighten with the thought, of the Christmas pantomime:
a very serious matter, and deep, withal; so deep it begins in the brain
—on the very top of the pia mater where the soul is said to reside, and
when microscopes are brought to perfection where it will, no doubt, be
shown at so much a head—it begins, we say, in the brain, and only ends
in the very bottom of the pocket. Perhaps, in this multitudinous
london, there is not a more contemplative, more self-denying, more
public-spirited, and º man than a London manager
about to open in the month of October. He has for many months to
please, instruct, and, by the purest and most refined means, to elevate
a British public, and—(we have now, by means of a hop-pole, jumped
from October, lighting among roses in July;)—and, of course, with
scarcely an ignominious exception, of course he has done it. Anyway,
he has done something.
Hail then, hail October; when the winter playhouses open' When
the doors of the national academies turn on their “harmonious hinges”
to take in an English public. Hail, ye play-bills; ye chronicles of
truth ! Beautiful is the odour of your ink—whether of violet blue, or
rosy red. And for your black, how often is your black white, and your
white so very black
. Biggest, however, of managers—for at this writing he manages the
biggest house—is MR., GEORGE, Bolton, ensconced in the halls of
Drury Lane, like the lady in the head of the lobster; and, it is said by
the malevolent, knowing as much about Drury Lane as the aforesaid
gentlewoman knows of her crustaceous dwelling-place. What of that?
Play-house knowledge comes—even to simpletons—naturally as swim-
ming to a goose. If a man can sit cross-legged as an irreproachable
tailor, can he not also sit upon the Drama? Surely, if he can face a
coat, he can face the public! But our Bolton has had large expe-
rience; as a wandering meteor he has often appeared. Now is he seen
fitfully sparkling at the Olympic—now he flickers and goes out at the
Strand-again he is lighted and guttering at Marylebone—and the
extinguisher. being dropt, and after a while removed, he is, they
i. again lighted and burning in the big candle-shade of Drury
e.
The thoughtful and imaginative declare that as our Bolton crossed
garden trees—that imparts|5
the threshold of Drury Lane, the plaster effigy of SHAKsPEARE over
Drury's portico was collapsed as with sudden belly-ache; and the
marble of EpMUND KEAN in Drury's portico perspired a marble per-
spiration. But we give this merely as rumour.
And GEORGE Bolton §: with Richelieu. To prove, too, that
some of his company could read, one of the actresses generously played
from the printed book! But enough of Bolton.
Oh, Committee-men of Drury Lane, what are you doing? Was there
no badger to be baited on the boards (there are spectators for all sights
in London), that you should allow SIR Edward Lytton Bulwer
– (one made to draw, not to be drawn) — to be bitten, and
gnawed, and worried by tormentors from Plymouth, Nomouth,
Allmouth, Wrymouth, and other towns and wapentakes? And
then Knowles—dear, good, right-hearted KNowLEs!—why should
he be tortured? Could it be any salve to the wounds of the poet to
know that the actor who played Master Walter took a bold and original
view of the Hunchback, playing him like a dromedary with two humps
instead of one? Why exhibit the poet's Hunchback—when a real
dwarf was to be had—bossed all over like a potatof Why, too, expose
SHAKSPEARE when Spotted Boys are to be had or manufactured P. We
ask you why, because the exhibition in Drury Lane Wan must be even
. poia, than the exposure of the mangled bodies of outraged
arols
Oh, Committee-men—you may reply and say—“Drury Lane is a bad
business; a dead thing; an extinct playhouse mammoth; the skeleton
of a dead whale—only a thousand times bigger—like the cutting of
whalebone shown once upon a time in Trafalgar Square. What shall
we do with it? Counsel, advise us, oh Punch / Shall we make of
Drury Lane a brewery P’’ - --- -
No: for what you have done, and are doing, will impart eternal flat-
ness to your vats: your theatric thunder will for ever muddle the beer.
“Shall we make of Drury Lane a monster cook-shop?”
No, for fate will hang about it still: no man will ever be able to get
salt from it.
“What them, oh Punch, shall we make of Drury Lane?”
And Punch answers-oh, Committee-men, make of Drury Lane
Theatre a large Soap-boiler's; for only by so doing can you now by
any chance come out of it with clean hands.
THE LIBERAL
“ ROPE OF SAND.”
oseph HUME has adminis-
tered a fatherly whipping to
the nominal Liberals in the
House of Commons. , If... the
castigation be deserved ; if the
boys be as naughty as Joseph,
with a touch of sorrow, de-
clares them to be: why then
must the EARL of DERby rub
his hands composedly, and
even MAJOR BERESFORD take
heart, with the hope of taking
further salary; heart and
pocket being at times synony-
mous—in fact, one and the
same “hollow muscle.”
A rope of sand! And is it
come to this? Can we believe
in the truth of the image P
E. We, wi.h the words of pro-
testing candidates—(the por-
wiggle members that have since
become full M.P. croakers)—
still beating at our brain, can
we consider those ardent, vociferous, patriotic men, of, the hustings
as only so many particles, incapable, from their individual angularity-
like particles of sand—of any cohesion? Is it impossible to bind them
together? Can nothing be made of them? Let us hope it.
Granted that all these Liberals can take the form, the semblance of a
rope of sand—and of such seemingly cohering, but really divided
*. Joseph HUME himself may make a tremendous weapon.
As thus.
Sand, by intense heat, is vitrified; melted into one cohesive mass.
Very well, then. What is easier than for Joseph with the fire and flame
of his eloquence to turn the rope of sand into a twisted pillar of crystal?
Ere now, eloquence has worked such wonders, melting and moulding
divided bodies into one compact mass. Great—as Paxton, has shown,
and will further show us—are the capabilities of glass. We have had
our Crystal Palace: let us next winter have our Crystal Opposition.
The Roman boasted that he found a city brick, and left it marble.
Let it be the pride of HUME to find the Liberals, not bricks, but grains
of sand; and to leave them an entire and “perfect chrysolite.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 173
THE LONDON PARIA,
READER, if ever you chance to go.
Through some narrow street of wide Soho,
Where the pavement swarms with children small,
And eggs are sold } the blouse-clad Gaul;
Where a penny is all the shaver's pay;
Where the Magyar seeks the Estaminet; –
Glance at the windows, while passing by,
The Paria, perchance, may strike your eye.
From a window that gapes on a second floor,
Crossing his arms on the sill before,
Gloomily calm is the Paria seen.
Smoking his pipe with a lofty mien.
Beneath is a noisy, motley, crowd, , . -
But it turns not his thoughts from his broad white cloud.
What to him is the throng below— -
The man's deep curse, or the child's shrill woe
He watches his fumes as they rise and go,
Melting away into hueless air, .
As sorrow melts into blank despair. . . -
You'll fancy, perhaps, that his wandering mind
*Mid those spreading, fading wreaths can find
Some vision of happy days, which yet
He dwells upon with a fond regret.
Not so. —Though scorn has left its trace
Branded upon his proud pale face;
'Tis but the stamp of a pain that’s past,
For even regret must die at last.
What was this being cut off from the rest
Of the world and its varied interest ?
Some talk of a fortune spent in youth—
But who can prove that they tell the truth *
What is his calling? No one knows.
He seems to have neither friends nor foes;
And yet you’ll hear the neighbours say,
Though poor, he always “pays his way.”
Perchance he writes with small profit—no fame-
A book that comes out with a noble name;
Or some kinsman rich, on his dying bed,
Left him enough for cheese and bread:
Or perhaps—perhaps—but conjectures tire,
When all know nothing, and few inquire—
We can learn by his broad unwrinkled brow
That the Paria, at least, is contented now;
And whatever storms have troubled the past,
A sort of haven is found at last. -
To him who thinks life but a pointless joke,
'Tis enough to eat, drink, sleep, and smoke,
*Till he ends his course—alone—alone,
By none regretted—regretting none.
Punning in the Provinces.
At one of the concerts of the late. Norwich Festival, there was

DRINK–THEN CRITICISE.
MR. M'KEAN BUCHANAN, who upon the authority
of a few playbills, is “the greatest actor, since
KEAN,” writes to an American paper the following
truth upon English criticism:-
“Could the ‘Café de l'Europe’ speak, it would reveal the
cause of the success or failure of many an artist; for there
criticism is purchased at the price of a dinner, or glass of ale."-
New York Atlas.
We do not know whether the Café de l'Europe is
the old established shop for criticism in London, nor
the quality of the criticism that is sold there-
whether it is strong, or mild, or bitter, or mixed,
or full-flavoured; but this we do know, that if
MR. M'KEAN Buchanan did pay for his dinner or
glass of ale to get the criticism he wanted, he
has been very ill-used, and his money ought to
be returned to him; for we do not recollect seeing
a criticism in any one of the London papers that
came to the same conclusion as the play-bills—that
he is “the grea'est actor since KFAN.”
In the meantime the Café de l'Europe ought
to write up over its door “CRITIcisms Seaved At
the Shortest Notice,” with an intimation that
there is “A PRIVATE Room. For AMERICAN
ACTORs.”
“Tipping a Wink.”
We believe there is such an expression as
“tipping a wink”. This expression might be
º to the Winking Virgin, for we are positive
the Roman Catholic priests, only keep up the
“wink” on account of the “tipping” that is con-
nected with it.

case is that of one GIBBINGs, a gunner
and driver in the †: a8
times go, a badly educated regiment,
and, therefore, the more likely to be
shocked at LoRD FitzRoy's bad language)—and the misbehaving
Gibbings having been duly tried by Court-Martial, and
“The Court having maturely considered the evidence, &c., is of opinion the prisoner
is guilty, which being in breach of the Mutiny Act, do sentence him to be transported
as a felon for the term of seven years.”
The Court has, evidently, not made up its mind whether it is plural
or singular. , Mr. Punch would say, decidedly, singular. As for that
unhappy “which,” no wonder it is “in breach,” or anywhere else, to
get out of the way of observance. It is the more surprising, as the
SoMERsets are not supposed to be justly chargeable with not knowing
how to place their relatives... If anything set, forth in the above
passage is in breach of the Mutiny Act, it is clearly the conduct of the
Court. But would that this were all'ſ "Alasi take the very next
pa'agraph :-
“I have directions to acquaint your lordship that IIER MAJESTY was pleased to
approve the finding and sentence of the Court, &c.
“I have the honour to be, &c.
“FitzRoy Soxiehset.”
LoRD FITzRoy Somerset has, hitherto, been held a nobleman of
untarnished bonour, and Mr. Punch regrets to affix the first blot upon
his scutcheon. But it is Mr. Punch's painful duty to charge Lord
FitzRoy with having deliberately stated that which must be...untrue.
The Queen approve such a 'sentence”, as that! Heh MAJESTY

offence will be, to order that these observations be “read out” at three
mess dinners of the valiant and intelligent fellows whom your º

CHANCERY ON THE GO.
ForMERLY the Courts of Law used to follow the person of the
Sovereign; and justice put up its booth wherever royalty happened to be
staying. Something ;P a similar kind seems . looming in the future,”
or at all events we have had an instance of d. beginning to lead
again a wandering life, for one of the Vice-Chancellors was to attend
"on Tuesday the 12th, at the Pavilion Hotel, Folkstone, to hear
motions.” This seems to be the reverse of taking justice home to
every man's door; and it is calling every man from his own, door to the
sea-side who happens to have a motion for hearing in the Court of the
Vice-Chancellor. The counsel's fee will of course include his ticket by
the rail, with his hotel and other charges. Perhaps the next move of
justice may be on to the Channel itself, where the hearing of motions
may be interrupted by the feeling of a motion peculiar to the element,
whose uncertainty would make it a most appropriate spot for a pro-
ceeding in Chancery.

APOLOGY.
PUNCH presents his compliments to the late Lord FitzRoy SoMERSET,
whom he addressed last week on some bad language used by his lordship
to the Artillery. Punch did not intend that so severe a punishment as
has followed his criticism should have fallen upon that unfortunate
nobleman. Punch always endeavours to temper the blade of justice in
the water of mercy. Could he have ſoreseen that when his paragraph
met the eye of the Fountain of Honour, the ILLUsTRious Quarter
in question would have felt so incensed with Lord F. S., as to order
that his name should never be pronounced at Court again, Punch would
have paused over his castigatory sentences. The Gazette, introducing
LoRD Raglan to a generous British public, so instantly followed
Punch's remarks as almost to astonish that gentleman. However,
what is done cannot be undone, and Mr. Punch can only express his
regret that, in complaining of his fellow-servant's conduct to their
Royal MISTREss, he should have compelled that servant to go to
“another place.”

OLD BEDLAM BACK AGAIN |
FROM this stage of advancement in psychology and humanity, we look
back almost incredulous at the miseries, the tortures, the cruelties, the
atrocious mal-treatment, once, under the name of treatment, inflicted on
the insane. Accompanied with some doubt that such horrors ever
existed, is our retrospect of the fetters, manacles, stripes, bruises,
wounds, sores, nudity in straw, filth, and vermin, then ordinarily
associated with the idea of madness-then the regular circumstances
of a residence in Bedlam.
However, there is no doubt that such things were-once upon a
time. Of course, a very long time ; somewhere in the dark ages,
the days of racks, thumb-screws, red-hot pincers, whipping, branding,
ear-cropping, half-hanging, embowelling, and burning alive? Not
later, at least, than the good old times, whose goodness is chronicled
and illustrated by FIELDING and HogaRTH P
Why no; not quite so near to primitive antiquity. A little farther
from the mythological era: somewhat less deep in the gloom of ages.
Not in the epoch of the late SIR THOMAs Booby, but in that of the
present SIR PETER LAURIE ; in short, only the other day.
Read the evidence that has been laid before the Commissioners of
Lunacy relative to the management of the patients in Bethlehem
Hospital. In particular, peruse the cases of Miss HANNAH Hyson, of
Miss WHITTINGHAM, and Miss MoRLEY—if you can. For that may
not be possible if your sensibilities are strong and your stomach is
weak; and hence it may be understood why the details alluded to are
not quoted in a periodical which is taken in at every coffee-house, and
lies on all tables at every meal.
Read also the statements, explanatory, and apologetic—of the
Treasurer, the Matron, and the Resident Medical Officer, together with
MR. P. N. LAURIE’s defence of the Governors; from all which testimony
you will discern that the facts of these ſilthy and frightful disclosures
resulted, in the main, from some of the parties, responsible for the
conduct of the ... being too lazy, others too fine, others too much
overworked, properly to attend to it: the end being that the unfortunate
patients were abandoned to, BETsy PRIGs, who consumed their pro-
visions, drank their “stimulants,” probably withheld their medicine,
starved them, beat them, kept them in filth, straw, and, it would seem,
in c
To account for these enormities may be mentioned one more
circumstance—thus stated by the Observer:-
“lt will be remarked that at the head of this establishment of officials is SIR PETER
LAURIE. Some of onr readers may probably bring to their recollection the many and
the heated discussions which took place at the meetings of the magistrates for the
county of Middlesex upon the motions that were brought forward by MR, SERGEANT
ADAMs and others for the introduction of the “Humane or non-restraint system' of
treating the lunatic paupers in the Hanwell Asylum. Who was the most violent
opponent, upon those occasions, to the motions? A reference to the reports of the
various meetings will prove that that opponent was SIR PETER LAURIE. Moreover, it
will be found that the worthy alderman, in most of his speeches in opposition, not
merely condemned the attempt to recognise and introduce the ‘non-restraint system,'
proposed by DR. Connolly to be put into permanent practice at Hanwell, but he set
up the course of treatment in use in Bethlehem Hospital, of which establishment he
was himself the leading head, and the good resulting from the
lan adopted in St.
George's Fields, as the strongest possible ground for not enterta
ng the proposition.”
SIR PETER has now pretty good proof that the inhuman and restraint
system—or what amounts to the same thing, the negligent system, of
treating the insane does not answer...Let him—who puts down every.
body and everything that exalts itself against his majesty, from ji.
to Joseph ADy—put down that. Surely the stubbornness of SIR PETER
LAURIE, even, exceedeth not the stubbornness of facts. If it doth, long
are the ears of LAURIE, and he goeth on all-fours; let him graze grass,
and drink water, and munch the thistles of the plain.
“PROTECTION" IN FRANCE.
WE read in the Times the other day, that among the inscriptions to
Louis NAPOLEon during his late “Progress,” there was one at Lyons—
“To THE PROTECTOR OF AGRICULTURE.”
And, as a proof of his Protectorship, we find it stated in the same day's
paper that-
“The President has suppressed the National Agricultural College at Versailles
That branch of industry is therefore now abandoned to itself. It is the only one which
may be said to be so."
A pleasant instance of his “Protection” this!, The “protection”
truly of the Upas tree—blighting where it overshadows.
RAILWAY SLIPS,
THE papers, contain another account of a great “Railway Slip"—
meaning, a slip of land. . But there are other slips upon a railway,
which the papers do not take such frequent notice of slips of time
and comfort, and proper attention—slips that are repeatedly followed
by the loss, not only of property, but of life. This excuse,
however, must be made—that, if notice were taken of all these little
gºº. a newspaper would be made up of nothing but “Railway

An Arch Amendment.
AMONGST the many triumphal arches erected in the Moniteur, in
honour of the President's Progress, there was one with the following
inscription, “A Louis NApoléon, St. MACAIRE”. That inscription
is capable of a very great improvement, which would admirably illus-
trate the present position of French affairs, besides bringing promi-
mently forward the name of the prime mover of the Presidential
triumphs. The inscription, strictly speaking, should have stood thus:–
“A Louis NAPOLeon, Robert MACAIRE.”

LETTERS FROM THE DEAD TO THE LIVING.
AUGUSTU's CAESAR to LOUIS NAPOLEON.
on PRINCE, - I have
heard some unfor-
tunates º
Who were killed by
your troops in the
Rue de la Paix,
That some mortals are
foolish enough to
compare
Your actions and for-
tune with mine ;
but my care
For my character bids
me here let them all
see, -
How greatly we differ
— how slightly
agree.
I grant some resem-
(i. at first may
appear,
For we both have had
Uncles, and they
are both here;
Each was great in his
day, and I shall not
disclaim
My share of our debt
to their fortune and
fame.
Like yours, too, my
power at first be-
came great
By the feuds and the factions which harassed the state;
For my country, like France, in her thirst for repose
From the blunders of friends and the bluster of foes,
Seeing evils all round, thought the smallest of any
Was to help the one tyrant to keep down the many.
Your eagles, I doubt not, are modelled on mine;.
And my cohorts, no less than your troops of the line,
When employed on the dirtiest jobs of their trade, -
Merely cared not for what, but how much, they were paid.
Like you, then, I waded through blood to a grown;
Like you, bound the last friends of Liberty down;
There the parallel ends: would you have it endure?
Know—the chains that will stretch most will prove most secure!
Although cruel at first, I grew clement in turn,
And knew how to forgive; you’ve that lesson to learn :
I ſurnished a theme for CoRNEILLE's glowing page,
You—on fête days exhibit CoRNEILLE on the stage ;
Content with controlling the actions of each
In my empire, I left them the freedom of speech;
They might murmur who pleased, if they yielded to me;
You expect all your slaves to affirm they are free:
lf a satire were good, why | I laughed with the rest,
And punished no libel; you chaſe at each jest.
Believe me, a ruler gives point to a joke,
When he shows it possesses the power to provoke:
I did nought to corrupt those I sought to enslave,
But was decent in private, in public was grave;
For my friend every statesman I laboured to gain; ,
You have banished all those who could teach you to reign,
And, when asked with what sages or wits you are seen, I
For AGRIPPA name Fould, for MECAENAs, PERSIGNY:
I kept genius at home to emblazon my fame;
You have forced it to travel and publish your shame:
Like you, I was flattered, you’ll say; but, vain Fool,
I was flattered by HoRACE; you’re spurned by REBOUL.:*
VIRGII, deemed his best strains to my clemency due,
But VfRON himself cannot always praise you.
The world from the grave SUETóNius has heard,
I was firm in my friendships, and true to my word;
But CassagNAc even, whatever might be
His reward, could not pay that last tribute to thee:
Thus, unguarded I lived, in the streets or at home,
And one cohort sufficed to keep order in Rome.
Yes, Prince 1 you may hasten the Empire to claim
(I had ruled twenty years ere I heard of the name),
* REeoul, the poor poet of Nismes, who has just refused to accept the Cross of the
Legion of IIonour from the Prince President.
But think not—although to your pride and your power
No check shall arrive till your life's latest hour;
Though the people, still servile, the troops, always true,
Shall join in no plots, save those sanctioned by you, -
Though new virtues the press to your race shall ascribe,
And, now cowed by a menace, now fed by a bribe,
All its former wit merged in a blasphemous whine,
Shall affirm that its master is all but Divine;—
Yet think not, buoyed up by a dream of success,
When their lips praise you most, their hearts hate you the less :
Your people may cringe; ours, thank Heaven! could trust us;
Your's can only fear you; ours respected AUGUSTUs.
SAFE FIGHTING.
THIs is to be done—after an Irish fashion. It appears a contradic-
tion, but we can have a most tremendous war between the magnanimous
Çelt and the contemptible Saxon, and no bloodshed, no bones broken;
The notion must have been whispered by the dove of peace—whispered
into the writer's ear, even as MAHOMET's pigeon cooed celestial
intelligence to the Prophet. The editor of the Galway Erecrator
asserts and proclaims:–
“That the Irish are perfectly armed; let it be known that while we have steam-engines
we can bid defiance to brutal Britons. A man can throw stones, a steam-engine will like-
wise throw stones, because a steam-engine will do anything a man can do The steam-
engine will wield a sling, may fifty slings whose cords are cables / and whose missiles are
rocks / / It will sweep into the air masses of granite, which whirling on high large as a
cabin, and soaring into the sky / / / will descend with a terrible rush upon squadrons of
horse and regiments of infantry, will make mash of men and horses, or, breaking their
ranks, will make them fly in every direction like madmen l l Shareholders in railways
should know, &c., &c., that democracy can arm itself with steam-engines.”
But stop—a word in your ear, friend Erecrator. If it must come to
this, if the Celt will have steam-engine, slings, why not the Saxon f
We know, in comparison with Celtic intelligence, we are a benighted,
stupid people: we are misty-brained and moony-eyed; nevertheless, we
are not quite such fools as to march to be made a “mash” of. We
would not, dull as we are, attempt to recruit to meet such a power.
“Wanted, five hundred fine young men for the Hare-brained Cavalry,
to meet missiles like rocks, to be mashed, men and horses, and, finally,
to fly in º direction like madmen.” The Saxon humbly owns
himself a fool, but not quite such a fool as that.
Therefore, friend Erecrator, we shall fight your steam-engines with
our steam-engines. Iron to iron-stone slung against stone. . And
how beautiful, when the stones, big as cabins (Irish cabins, those homes
of peace and self-respect!)—how beautiful when the stones clash in the
air, and break into powder; the fight being left, entirely between the
contending engines, the opposing missiles. This is a very pacific
*..." upon war; moreover, it is quite Irish. A terrific hubbub,
and nothing done.
The Saxon had his iron general; but the Celt will have an iron army.
When, may we ask, will GENERAL Piston, CoLonEL HIGH-PREssure,
MAJOR WALve, and so forth, be gazetted P. What if we propose as the
auspicious day, the Fifth of Movember?
THE MORISONIAN SYSTEM OF PUTTING OUT A FIRE.
MoUNT AETNA has been on fire for nearly two months. It is
blazing away even now. It is rather too far to send MR. BRAIDwoop
with a detachment of engines, for the purpose of extinguishing this
“Tremendous Fire,” but we º: that MR. PhILLIPs be despatched
instanter with a *. of his “Fire Annihilators” to try what he can
do with them. Let him throw into the mouth of the crater, by way
of a first dose, two dozen of his fiery boluses. If they do not make
the patient a little more easy, let the second dose be increased to four
dozen; and, if these do not give AEtna its quietus, let the third dose
be augmented to eight dozen, which, if there is any faith in the
MoRIsonIAN system of Fº ought to prove an effectual
extinguisher. This would only be a fair test of MR. PHILLIPs's
“Fire Annihilator;” for it stands to reason that, if it, succeeds in
putting out the pipe of a volcano that has been smoking, with an
endless supply of “fire,” for upwards of two months, it must be
equally successful in blowing out any, little farthing rushlight of a
conflagration that we may have in England... We should like to be
present to see MR. PHILLIPs standing over the crater, with a Fire-
Annihilator, like a pill, between his thumb and his fore-finger, and to
. him say to Ætna, “Open your mouth and see what I will
send you.”
Near the Truth.
WHY is the ruffian CANNoN, who nearly murdered the policeman, like
a certain popular swindle?–Because he is a Monster Sweep.

much to the consummate versatility and talent of the actors engaged,
as to any intrinsic merit of the work itself. We have extracted the

measures, and so forth, are a peculiar sort of African charm, which
niggers always wear about their person.

ALLEGED HEARTLESS ROBBERY OF A BRITISH AUTHOR,
We take from, the Sunday Times the subjoined paragraph—which,
perhaps, our contemporary took from the Hue and Cry.
“An American author has, we understand, written an “Alpine Entertainment,’
after the manner of ALBERT SMITH's, for a popular comedian of the United States, who
intends producing it in New York in the coming winter. Ofcourse the clever gentie:
men who have seized upon MR. SMITH's ideas will endeavour to pass them off as original
‘motions' upon their countrymen. We recommend our transatlantic friends not to be
in a hurry, but to wait until the real Alpine traveller visits them with his genuine
entertainment.”

American author and popular comedian”—if they have really stolen
MR, SMITH's notion—are only indictable at the tribunal of opinion.

GREEK AGAINST GREEK.
THE Police Reports have contained an account of the ferocious
assault on a patient and brave policeman, committed by a biped brute
named CANNon. However, among the Police this GANNoN might have
met with his match. Under the head of Bridgnorth, the Shrewsbury
Chronicle records the cate ensuing :-
“Thomas Brown, a weak and sickly-looking young man, who had been in prison
since the previous Saturday, was charged with being drunk. In this case some
sensation was created in court by the disclosure of the way in which the policeman,
Dovey, acted in conveying the defendant to prison. The defendant said that Dovey
struck and knocked him down several times, and also bumped his hea upon the
pavement. Dovey did not deny having used some violence, of which the defendant's
face bore ample testimony. The MAYoº told Dovey that he thought he had no right
to use such violence towards any man. To which the officer replied that he was quite
justified in what he had done, and that according to the directions issued to the force,
he would have been justified in knocking out his (the defendant's), brains (sensation).
MR. WYLDr Beown, one of the magistrates, said the police were allowed to use their
own discretion, and must be protected. The MAYoh begged to express a different
opinion, and again told Dovey that it was certainly not right to use such an amount of
force towards so weakly a man as the defendant. The policeman replied that he had
not exceeded his duty, “and,” said he, “the next drunken man I take up, I will break
his head with my staff.” We may mention en passant, that although Dovey is con-
sidered a good officer, he is in the constant habit of having a large dog at his heels
whenever he has any duty to perform. The subject of the propriety of keeping such a
dog has been brought before the magistrates more than once, but still the system is
followed up.”
Now, this gentle “Dovey” would have been just the bird to oppose
to such a beast as CANNon. The latter is precisely the subject for the
former to have taken up. Mutually º: they might, like violent
chemical agents, have neutralised each other's active properties; at
least have reduced one another to that state in which each had better
be for the welfare of society.
AN UNENLIGHTENED CLERGYMAN.
We are apt to boast of the intelligence of the age, but great intel-
lectual destitution still exists among us, in the provinces. At the late
Castle Hedingham Conservative dinner, a clergyman, the Rev. J. Cox,
alluding to the insults offered to MAJOR BERESFORD at the election for
North Essex, said,
“Among the disgraceful standards exhibited, was one with the words “A shilling
for his head and pluck!’”
Now really we must say, that MR. Cox, as a teacher of the people,
ought, at this time of day, to know better than to understand the words
“head and pluck” in the literal, anatomical, and sanguinary sense.
Another time we trust MR. Cox will recollect that “head,” in the
language of the free and independent signifies wisdom, and “pluck,”
valour, and not run his over-sensitive nose against a popular metaphor.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHIARIVARI.
THE LEADING MEN
IN THE CITY.
-
WE hear a great deal about the leading men in the City, ald one
would naturally expect to find them a good way in advance of the age;
more especially when we see them putting themselves forward to claim
precedence on numerous occasions. Whenever there is a feast or a
show on any grand scale, the Corporation of London wants to have the
first finger in the pie, and all the front seats at the spectacle. When
the QUEEN ºf the City, the Corporation had not only the first
finger in the pie, but all its fingers in all the pies, tarts, jellies, and
custard cups. Not satisfied with a reasonable proximity to Royalty, the
Corporation and its friends, mobbed Majesty to such an unpleasant
extent, that the QUEEN could hardly make her way to the “appointed
spot” where refreshments awaited her.
After the specimen thus recently given of the sort of use made of
their precedence by the City Magistrates, we may naturally ask, what
is likely to be the result of their having it their own way at the late
DUKE OF WELLINGTON's funeral? Setting aside the possibility of
their not knowing how to behave themselves, and converting a solemn
ceremony into an indecent scramble, we should like to inquire how
far the City potentates are foremost in general matters, so as to justify
their claim to take the FIRST PLACE on great occasions. The City has,
undoubtedly, taken precedence, in the great Smithfield nuisance
}...". or it is only too notorious that the City has been the
rst—and the last—in trying to uphold the cause of filth within its
precincts.
In the article of Sewers, also, the City has shown a forwardness in
hanging backward, and a strong disinclination to follow anything—even
though it should be the spirit of the Times—which points in the direc-
tion of progress. Another remarkable instance of City forwardness is
shown in the eagerness of the Corporation to advance the price of
coals, º putting a tax on them for the profit of the Corporation, and
for the loss of the public in general. Another claim to precedence on
the part of the City may be deduced from its going beyond everything
else in the way of exaction, and rushing forward to its very gate to
take toll from those who enter.
... We think we have disposed of the claim to precedence set up by the
civic authorities. We are aware that the Lord MAYOR assumes the
right of blocking up Temple Bar, even against Majesty itself; but,
happily, *::: in the humble guise of a hair-dresser, has taken up its
quarters in the shop under the archway, and is ready to let HER
Majesty in by a side-door, should the City potentates venture to carry
their claim of precedence, to such a point as , the exclusion of the
sovereign from the seat of Mayoral mock monarchy.
TOL(DEROLDEROLD)ERATION
SONG AND CHORUS: TO BE LEARNED BY MR. LUCAS AND
THE IRISH BRIGADE,
And Sung by them at the Opening of Parliament, to the tane of the
“Picar of Bray.”
Sweet Protestants, attend to me,
Dear goose, and gull, and pigeon,
We want to have equality
In matters of religion;
But what that means let me expound,
And don't suppose we hate you;
I'll tell you how—should we get ground—
We mean to tolerate you;
orus.
Yes, when we once have gained our end; and that is Domination,
We'll tolerate you with a tol—derolderolderation.
Between us whilst the people are
In equal parts divided,
The Law's protection we will share
In no resptct one-sided;
Be free to teach, and preach, and pray,
As pleases your volition,
And unmolested go your way
Serenely to *; :
origs.
And when we once have gained our end; and that is Domination,
We'll tolerate you with a tol-derolderoideration.
Object to relic or to saint,
Our wonders treat as fable,
We'll put you under no restraint
One hour before we’re able;
Your tongues against our tenets wag,
And we will grin and bear it,
Nor ever put you on the gag,
Till we can make you wear it;
Chorus.
Then when at last we've gained our end; and that is Domination,
We'll tolerate you with a tol—derolderolderation.
But when—the blessed day, we hope,
Is not extremely distant-
The realm at large shall own the Pope,
We must be more consistent.
To wretch that from our faith secedes
Due justice shall be meted;
For heretics are baleful weeds,
And should as such be treated :
Chorus. -
So when at length we’ve gained our end; and that is Domination,
We’ll tolerate you with a tol—derolderolderation.
And thus we’ve made it plain and clear
As daylight, MR. SPEAKER,
That you from us have nought to fear,
As long as we're the weaker;
Our liberal professions you
Will not look as a sham on,
But rest assured that they are true,
And no delusive gammon;
Aware that when we’ve gained our end; and that is Domination,
We'll tolerate you with a tol—derolderolderation.
So when we rise to ask full swing
And scope for our persuasion,
The MADIAI of course you’ll bring
Not up on that occasion;
Nor, now our sentiments are known,
And you see what we’re after,
Receive our eloquence with groan,
And hiss, and º laughter;
orus.
Assured that when we’ve gained our end; the which is Domination, .
We’ll tolerate you with a tol—derolderolderation'

“TWO GOOD KISSES 22 OF THE POPE.
THE French GENERALGEMEAU is a proud, almost asacred man. He
has given two good kisses to infallibility. The Pope, writes the
General, embraced him cordially, when he says, “I took the advantage”
—(leave Louis NApoleon's general alone for that)-“the advantage of
this to give two good kisses to the august head.” Kisses so given
must have been sublimating: nay, would, no doubt-(it seems a
paradox)—have been equally so, had they been quite the reverse. .
“The august head”—continues the General—“which it is permitted
no one to touch, or scarcely even to look in the face.”... But it is other-
wise with the General : he has at once indicated his filial affection as a
son of the Church and his audacity as a soldier. GENERALGEMEAU has
kissed the Pope, and may henceforth take his place side by side with
the courageous cat that looked at a king !
Two good kisses of the Pope by the private ambassador of LOUIs
NAPoleon I Kisses of JUDAs in regimentals! Traitorous smacks that,
at this minute, resound through France; making sad, almost despairing
the hearts of true men, and filling the smothering bosoms of a grasping,
tyrannous, and soul-enslaving priesthood with hopes, nay, with
assurance of domination. Louis NApoleon kisses the priesthood;
gives them affectionate salutation, and the priesthood, for a time,
make him a present of their bodies and souls. The callow EMPEROR is
such an affectionate, such an enduring son of the Church, that the
Church will sing Hosannahs to him—will see in the hero of the second
of December the “Elect of God; ” the election having been made in
fire and blood, and hailed with the groans of the outraged and dying.
However, we are glad that the Pope will visit Paris: for there is
now no doubt of the nature of the General's visit to the Vatican. It is
only right that Pius THE NINTH-the Wolf in the Holy Lambskin-
should consecrate Louis NAPOLEoN, the Perjurer in the Purple.
Of course NAPOLEoN III. will be duly anointed. How about the
oil? Could it lot be brought to him by a real dove?, The Boulogne
eagle was a failure; but doves are more teachable. Again, if no live
dove can be got up in the part, there are needy clever fellows, adroit
mechanicians among the Jesuits, who—after the manner of REGIOMON-
TANUs—could make a wooden dove that should seem like life. When a
religious mummery is to be got up, the Catholic Church was never yet
short of properties. Let a dove be ordered.
And for the anointing, if there be any gratitude—even a suspicion
of gratitude—in NApoleon III., he ought to have the oil not simple
oil, but oil mixed : darkened and flavoured with printers’ ink: say
three or four precious drops from the ink-tubs of the Morning Post /
LETTING THE CAT OUT OF THE BUDGET.
(From a Sunday Paper.)
WE are enabled to state, from exclusive sources of information, that
the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchequER is, constantly and intensely
occupied with the preparation of his forthcoming $ni. As he
works with his door bolted, and has stuffed up the key-hole with paper,
under the plausible, but transparent excuse of a draught, we cannot
pretend to describe the exact manner in which he proceeds, but from
sounds which are occasionally heard, and from the report of the servant
who brings the Right Honourable gentleman his lunch, we can state,
unhesitatingly, that he is taking great pains with his work. We were
the only journal to mention, last week, that the report that MR. DISRAELI
used quills was unfounded, and we are now able to add, that he never
writes but with a magnum-bonum, into which an ivory handle used to
be inserted, but this, which the Right Honourable gentleman found too
cold for his fingers, has been rejected for a cedar-wood pencil (HH).
Of course it would be premature to offer any speculation as to the
nature of the fiscal changes to be proposed by the CHANGELLOR OF THE
ExchEQUER, but from personal inspection of the marks on the pad
of blotting-paper on which he works, our informant states that there is
no reason to believe that any of the more important interests of the
country will be specifically assailed, although the general complexion
of the budget will, probably, be of a Protectionist character. Irish
politicians may deduce some fanciful, prophecy from the fact, that
several pieces of Orange-peel have been observed in the Right Honourable
[. fender, and the advocates of Jewish emancipation may not
uninterested in learning, that MR. DISRAELI has twice purchased
oranges at the shop of a well-known fruiterer, of the Hebrew persua-
tion. But we are not inclined to assert for these circumstances more
significance than attaches to an accident.
Late in the afternoon of yesterday MR. DISRAELI was overheard to
remark to himself that it was “deuced cool,” but whether this obser-
vation applied to any political act of any of his colleagues, or to the
state of the weather (our readers will remember that the thermometer
was low all day), we will not presume to decide; though, if we couple
the remark with the fact that the CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer
shortly afterwards rang for coals, we think we may claim an approxi-
mation to the real truth of the case, in preferring the latter solution.
During the earlier portion of his labours MR. DISRAELI invariably wore
the plaid waistcoat well known to frequenters of the House of Commons,
but he has exchanged it for a purple velvet one since the cold weather
set in. It is a curious coincidence, to say no more, that louis NAPO-
Leon, and our own CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER, should be
assuming the “imperial purple” at the same time, but truth is stranger
than fiction. We have only to add, that the Honourable gentleman is
fully alive to the wisdom of the old º: Delookulo serjere Sal uberri-
mum est, being always at his desk }. even o'clock in the morning;
but although we know it is the early bird that catches the “worm,” we
are disinclined to believe the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchequER medi.
tates any new duty on ardent spirits. Time will show. Wous verrons.
[LATEST PARTICULARS.]
Saturday Night.
We have an important addition to make to our announcement. In a
conversation which MR. DisrAELI had this day with his wine-merchant,
MR. BUNG (of the eminent firm of FUNGUs AND BUNG, Piccadilly),
the Right Honourable gentleman, in ordering some claret, said, on MR.
BUNg's mentioning the price, “Too dear, BUNg; too dear.” It is
hardly to be supposed that an individual in the CHANCELLOR OF THE
Exchequer’s responsible situation would use such words without a
deeper meaning than belongs to the language of non-official men.
Claret is too dear. This the Right Honourable gentleman admits.
And how is it to be cheapened, and who can do it? Werbum sap. The
duty on French wines is to come off.
A BOLD EMPIRIC.
THE grand metaphorical
figure — of fun-em-
bodied intheold tableau
of the Three Tailors of
Tooley Street, has been
at last matched by the
MAYOR OF Sævres,
who, in the name of the
French people, has pro-
claimed the Empire.
Such a declaration from
such a source is about
equivalent to a mani-
festo from Putney, pro-
claiming England a
republic, or an ukase
from Islington, placing
the nation under a
protectorate. Sèvres,
as almost everybody
will be aware, is a
suburb of Paris, and
is famous for the manu-
facture of Porcelain;
but we doubt if it
ever turned out a more
2) fragile article than that
2% which ... its Delphic
oracle, the Mayor, has
been , so eager to
fabricate. It is a somewhat singular coincidence that Sèvres, the
emporium of Porcelain, should have been the first to declare an
Emperor so absolute as to be worthy of China.

A Whale with the Tooth-ache.
We have lately seen an account of a whale suffering severely with the
tooth-ache, "We pity any poor creature, and especially a whale, afflicted
with such a malady, particularly as there is no effective remedy but
extraction, and there is no dentist to whom a whale can * to “have
it out.” The harpoon is rather a formidable toothpick if it happens to
hit the right place; but the suffering whale would experience little
relief from such dental—or rather acci-dental-succour: We must
confess we disbelieve the story of the tooth-ache, which is so very
wn-like a whale.
Sympathetic Paper.
It seems paper can be made out of sheet-iron. May we recommend
the use of this paper to Louis Napoleon P_It is decidedly the best
material for him to write his decrees upon. . The Code NAPQI.E.ON, too
when amended for the new Empire, should be printed on a similar kind
of paper. The laws which govern the French should be, like the
French themselves, appropriately bound in iron.

(rapidly changing the subject). “Yes, Yes | Beautiful! Beautiful! But
ses, Love, what A Magnificent BR.own Horse, AND how splendidly that Fellow
country have, we are aware, a vague notion, that in the
Colonies the natives are distinguished by a lightness of dress
amounting to downright levity, and that they look upon a
few feathers, stuck in the head, as a sort of graceful toilette
upon, which they have a right to plume themselves. A
handbill we have just seen from a puffing shoe-maker,
rushes into the opposite extreme, and recommends boots
and shoes as the sole, articles necessary in an outfit. Ten
ineas' worth are selected, with a due regard to variety,
rom the elegant dress japan to the coarse and clumsy
highlow. It is true that an intending emigrant takes an
important step, but this is no reason why his feet only
should require looking to. A gentleman who should land
at a Colony with no other wardrobe than an extensive stock
of shoes, would feel that the tradesman thus fleecing him
would owe him some sort of redress, which would then
be unattainable.
We do not profess to understand the principle upon
which a stock of boots and shoes are advertised as a
complete “outfit.” Among the items we find a pair of
“resilient,...or perfectly elastic ball or dinner boo's for

“leaping up again and again,” a quality in a pair o
boots, which, though perhaps suitable to a ball, would be
rather inconvenient at a dinner.

Expectation will soon be on the sharpest tip of its

Trick of the great political Conjuror. The Wizard of all
the points of the weathercock is naturally puzzled as to the
means of “doing the trick,” and he, sits at present pon-
dering with great anxiety over his “measure.” Wishing
to lend him a helping hand, we offer him the friendly hint,
that if he hopes to get into the quart bottle, his only
chance is to strain a pint.
INTERPRETATIONS FOR THE MILLION.
As Ministers utterly refuse to reveal anything of their opinions and
intentions, people are driven to endeavour to discover them, in some
degree, for themselves. Punch is, at this present writing, quite
overwhelmed with the shower of anecdotes which the nation, thirsting
for information, is pouring in upon him, with supplications that he will
draw inferences as to the views and designs of the eminent individuals
whose sayings and doings are thus recorded for him. Ever anxious to
benefit and to oblige, Mr. Punch subjoins a few interpretations which
he has put upon the remarkable facts recently communicated.
“SIR,-At a recent dinner-party, the EARL or DeRBy seeing LoRD
MALMEsbury, the º Secretary, about to take some anchovy
with his cod-fish, said, hastily, "Ah! my dear fellow, don't, don't.”
What do you infer from this?
“Your obedient subscriber, QUERY.”
[That the PREMIER strongly disapproves of Lond MALMEsBURY's
habit of putting up with foreign sauce.—P.]
“LADY BLANCHE ALMonDville (by her papa's desire) informs dear
Mr. Punch that she was the partner of the Chancellor of THE
ExchequER in a quadrille last week. After the second figure, MR.
DisRAELI, who talks very delightfully, said, ‘I think we got through
l'Été pretty well." LADY BLANche is desired to ask Mr. Punch
whether there was, any concealed meaning in these words—she does
not believe it, but her papa does.”
[The Earl is right. MR. DisBAELI meant that his party was satisfied
with the result of the General Election this summer.—P.
.“DEAR MR.PUNCH.-I had a box at the Haymarket Theatre a few
nights since. My next neighbour was one of the MINIsTeks, with a
party. In the course of the performance, which was Money, the
MINISTER said “WEBstER will show his teeth directly; capital fun.”
Surely this meant something more than mere appreciation of my friend
Benjamin's humour. “Yours perpetually, Scrut Atos PUBLICUs.”
[It meant that a certain American Statesman might see fit to swagger,
but that he was only talking for the elections. No war.-P.]
“Ms. Punch.-Going by the LoRD, Chancellor's, house, on
Tuesday, I observed two of his lordship's domestics at the door. , 9me
of them, as I passed, said to the other, His lordship thought he
should get to Doctor's Commons before WILLIAM, who, was a-foot.”
Had this speech any other significance than what lies on the surface?
“I am, your obedient servant, VIGILANT Jones.”
[Certainly, Jones.—It meant that. Loºp St. LeQNARDs hoped to
pass a Bill walking into the Ecclesiastical Courts.-P.]
“Two gents beg to inform Punch that travelling...for a lark lat
week, they were by haccident in the same train, with the Seçkº-
Tony or WAR. He was quite haffable, and did not abuse them in the
least, neither call them “rabble, which, as they have not either of them
got votes, he might have done. ...But, at getting ºut, the MAJOR said,
"Behind time again, as usual. Upon my word it's toº bad.’, 1)id he
mean anything more than he said, the gents would like to know, as
there is a bet on the subject?”
[No, gents. The MAJoR's speeches have never more than one
meaning, and not always even that.-P.
—
A Happy Expression.
ONE of “Our own Correspondents,” speaking of the (alleged) dis-
covery of an infernal machine at Marseilles, says, very innocently,
“The plot, it is thought, was originally hatched at Toulon.”
Hatched 1 Yes; that’s just the very word for it: seeing that the
discovery, there is little doubt, was a complete mare's nest.

“THE PEOPLE'S SUNDAY SCHOOL.”
Therº Crystal Sunday School—Sunday having had its religious
dues; dues, by the way, more likely to be paid by the exalting, purifying
influences that must of a surety make the atmosphere of the People's
Ørystal Palace; an excellent and appropriate name for it, doubtless
in its wºrk-day guise. But, on Sundays, let it be deemed and visited
as the People's Sunday School—a title happily bestowed upon the
marvel-as the rumour has reached us—by #. enlightened and pro-
found ChevaLIER Bunsen, Prussia's learned ambassador; a man
we humbly believe, to the full as likely to know the required
dues of the Sabbath as even SpottiswooD, aye, or it may be,
PLUMPTRE. And, stimulated by such knowledge, our Prussian Am-
bassador, with other ambassadors, is doing his best and heartiest to
furnish the aforesaid Sunday School with wondrous objects, each of
them a potent text to raise and refine the pupil people: objects, it may
be, of a somewhat more remote sort than are to be found at the Rose-
mary Branch on Sundays, or even at the Sabbath Grecian Saloon.
Bunsen sends to men of kindred worth and knowledge — to
GRRHARD, Lepsius, DE OLFers, of Berlin—to throw open their
precious stores to the searching and selecting capacities of Owen
Jones, and D1GBY WYATT, the Crystal travellers sent away to
bring back and naturalize at Sydenham all the wonders of ancient
foreign art. At Naples, the travellers—for the first time checked
—strangely enough meet with the coldest of cold shoulders from
the most sulphureous of Kings, BoMBA of bomb-throwing note.
What then? SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE-stout brother of the stoutest
and blithest of bottle-holders, PALMERSTON.—steps in ; mollifies the
brimstone court towards Jones and WYATT, even though catering for
heretical, liberal England; and our travellers, further aided by letters
from PRINCE CARIN1, Neapolitan Ambassador at Lutheran St.
James's, are permitted to make their way to the treasures of Naples,
to elect objects to be copied, casts to be taken; in fact to lay Naples
under such pleasant, humanizing contribution that—ever since her
monopoly of sulphur ceased—it may be Naples has never been so com-
plaisant to unorthodox England. And let justice be done to—what shall
we call them *—the Tories, now in Downing Street? No: They renounce
the name, smelling as it does of bigotry dead, and a little noisome.
Protectionists, then? Why, no; by no means Protectionists, as it is
said Lord DERby's Queen's Speech from the throne will make
manifest. Well, then, HER MAJESTY's Ministers—even short-coming
MALMesBURy, to boot—have smiled upon the People's Crystal Palace
and People's Sunday School, vouchsafing to MR. SAMUEL PHILLIPs—
active, suggestive teacher and Gold-Stick at the School and Palace of
the coming summer—sympathising and encouraging syllables. For the
EARL or DERBy—and he knows it—will have to face the bishops;
will have to answer well-meaning, but at times weakly-thinking
SHAFTESBURY. Exeter Hall, with its thousand indignant fingers,
twitches its thousand white neckcloths, crying, “No such Sunday
School for the People.” The meek and pious ARCHBIshop of CANTER.
Buay, is beset by a horde of what is called the inferior clergy.
Pluralist rectors and vicars, with souls separated by counties to save,
wax wroth in the pulpit, smiting the cushion as though that church
velvet were Sydenham Crystal to be shivered into atoms by the pious
fist. And the EARL of DERBY will have to meet this: yes, he will
have to swallow the black draught prepared for him at Exeter Hall,
and has resolved to take it, defying its effects.
We can almost prophesy a few of the arguments—all of them
thunderbolts—selected even from the Times of Friday, in which the
future wonders of the Crystal Palace are gorgeously forecast like the
glories of an Eastern sunrise. Is there not to be an Italian garden—
one of the many wonders of wonder-working PAxton—of 40 acres?
And will not this Italian garden - MR. PLUMPTRE may weepingly
demand—lead away the thoughts of Protestant England to the soil of
Rome * As a º: of what is to be done, no less than 50,000 scarlet
eraniums are ordered; and in early season will be in full bloom.
nsider it: 50,000 scarlet geraniums | Why, pondered on Sundays,
will (they not convert the Protestant mind, causing it by irresistible
influence to accept and love the Scarlet Abomination?
Again., PAxton promises that his two Pyramid Fountains will play
twice as long as the “Grandes Eaux”—the Great Waters at Versailles.
With twice the bulk of water, will there not—asks the Rev. JABEz
CRANK-will there not be twice the amount of Sabbath sin P The
wickedness of Versailles will, of a verity, be doubled at Sydenham |
Moreover, there are to be water-falls, small Niagaras. Why, it is
plain, that the people, after looking upon so much water—water
sparkling here, water roaring and tumbling there—will only feel a
greater thirst for the public-house, says FRANKINGENss. Is it not
plain, my brethren—is it not inevitable human wickedness that it
should be so—that with so much water, the people will and must have
so much Sabbath gin f
Yet further scandals. There are to be rocks scattered here and
there, to preach geology., Sermons in stones | When such sermons
are listened to, is not—asks a Canterbury MooRE—is not the Church
in danger ?
And to conclude, we are to have models of Nineveh Lions (all of
them smacking their lips at the cocknies to be devoured), Assyrian
Palaces, Assyrian Courts, with all the doomed and denounced of
SENNACHERIB and others too,wicked to mention., DR. LAYARD and
M. Botta are to superintend the idolatries, and—where do they think
they’ll go to ?
Such—Punch prophesies—is a sample of the withering, destructive
arguments to be hurled at the head of the EARL or l)eRBY, who, in
the stiff-neckedness of profane chivalry, has resolved to meet and, in
his own graceful way, to smile at them.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHIARIVARI.
“A PERSON OF HIS RANK.”
SIR JAMEs FRANCIs
RIVERs, BART., has been
fined and drolly lectured
by the awful Magistrates
of Bath. SIR JAMEs
FRANCIs Rivers, BART.,
is an eccentric gentle-
man—an odd chivalrous
member of the bloody
hand, the symbol of his
title : for SIR JAMEs
FRANcis Rivers, BART.,
driving to the Bath Rail-
way in a fitting dog-cart,
was—on good occasion
— mildly remonstrated
with by Isaac CREw,
railway porter, and
SAMUEL HAINEs, railway
policeman. To shorten
the tale, SiR JAMEs
FRANcis Rivers, BART.,
beat and lashed about
him with his whip CREw
and HAINEs, finally deal-
* upon the policeman
a blow in the stomach
which had disabled the
man from his duties since
the time, causing him to
spit blood.
“The magistrates having
| consulted together, the Mayor
(MR. W. Long), addressing
the defendant, said the magis-
trates had had no hesitation
whatever in coming to a de-
cision on this matter, which
was very discreditable to him.
For the first offence he was fined 50s. and costs, or in default to be committed for
one month; and for the second assault, which was more serious, he was fined in the
full penalty of 5l. and costs, or in default to be committed for two months.”
Of course SiR JAMEs FRANCIs Rivers, BART., put his symbolical
“bloody hand” in his pocket, and pulled out the fine and costs.
and merciful magistrates of Bath—fortunate Sir James FRANÇis
Rivers, BART.' For once upon a time there was—and is, and will be,
we hope, for many a day—a London Magistrate named HARDWICK,
who adjudged one of the folks of rank named SoMERs ET, to penitential
retirement under the guardianship of Governor CHESTERTON, the firm
and bland, of the House of Correction: the said HARDwick refusing
to mulct in money the police-whipping SoMERSET. Hence, it is safer
for a “man of rank” to soundly thrash two men at the Bath Railway
Station than to give two or three flourishing cuts about one policeman
in Rotten Row. The supplementary wisdom, too, uttered by a Bath
Mayor is, we hope, novel if not instructive. Addressing SIR. J. F. R.,
BART., he said,
“For a person of his rank such conduct was most discreditable.—The fines having
been paid, the defendant left the Court. It is not long since SIR JAMEs was fined in
the same court for furious driving.”
Most discreditable! Quite otherwise, MR. MAYor, . Nothing in this
Commercial country is discreditable if a man can, and is allowed to pay,
for it. , Money is the real fuller's earth, and—if permitted to be
applied-takes out even stains of ruffianism. It would have been
“most discreditable” to SIR JAMES FRANCIs RIVERs, Bart., had he
been locked up for a term with penniless ruffians, pauper desperadoes;
but the “fines having been paid,” there is nothing discreditable in the
transaction. Ready money covers a multitude of sins.
Political On Dit.
It is said that the EARL of DERBY is about to issue cards to the
leading members of his party, for a grand dinner on the 3rd of next
month, being the eve of the opening of Parliament. The principal dish
at this entertainment, will, we understand, consist of a large Humble
Pie, which the guests will partake of previously to renouncing Pro-
tection, and making amends to the memory of SIR RoberT PEEL.
An ILLITERATE MONSTER.
THE QUEEN’s Stationery Office is to be removed from Great James
Street, Westminster, to Princes Street. A sad fellow—better versed in
MILLER than in DILwoRTH-says he didn’t know that the Stationary
Office was moveable!
Mild |b
TRIUMPHAL ENTRY OF THE EMPEROR OF ALL
THE BEADLES INTO THE LOWTHER ARCADE.
At two o'clock his Highness the Beadle, accompanied by a very
brilliant staff—quite new for the occasion—arrived at the Strand
terminus of the Arcade, followed by an immense crowd of young girls,
and still younger boys, who saluted him with the wildest shouts of
“Long life to the Beadle,” “Wire BUMBLE II,” and other demonstrations
of affection.
It is impossible to give a detailed account of the various structures
placed in his way, but the operations were so extensive that they were
scarcely completed when he reached the entrance of the Arcade, and
the noise of the hammers blended cheerfully with the cheers of the
ninnyhammers at the moment of his arrival.
There were several triumphal monuments in various parts of the
Arcade; but, perhaps the most striking of the whole was that in
the window of the pastry-cook at the principal entrance. The
monument consisted of a double range of columns of the Corinthian
order placed one above the other. The lower series were of a
delicious spongey-looking cake, bearing on the frieze a scroll con-
taining the words, “Orders supplied,” and intended, no doubt, as a
compliment to the Beadle, by whom Order had been re-established.
The upper columns were of beautifully transparent barley-sugar, sur-
mounted with capitals of almond cake, enclosing the word “Ratifée,”
in honour of him by whom the hopes of the Arcade are ratified.
In the middle of the temple was a figure pointing with one hand to
some magnificent bowls filled with a dark substance resembling marble,
whMe the other hand—containing a scroll, with the words “always
ready,”—seemed to indicate that the Beadle might rely on the Arcade
being constantly prepared to do him honour. -
At the toy-shop, the front of the ground was occupied by a line of
cavalry, consisting of a file of light wooden horse, while, immediately
behind, there arose to a tremendous height a pile of shields, arms, and
flags, there being one larger than the rest with the words “BUMBLE II.”
on a glazed calico ground in gold paper letters.
Near the centre of the Arcade was a triumphal arch, going com-
pletely across from side to side, and erected at the joint expense of the
cheap China-shop and the establishment for the sale of wind instruments.
One side of the arch sprung from a gigantic vase at the base, till it
tapered up into a small candlestick, holding a taper in the centre, where
it was met by the mouth-piece of a small flageolet, and terminated on
the other side in the wrong end of an enormous ophicleide.
The balcony at the hair-dresser's was ornamented with a façade of
arbers' poles, from one of which depended a ſac-simile of the first
Beadle's wig, having a large label attached to it, inscribed
“vive BUMBLE II 1--THE HAIR OF THE BEADLEDOM.”
The front of the tailor's was completely coated over with specimens
of his art, and at the great crockery concern, over the way, the “United
Services” were represented by the ingenious blending of a tea and dinner
set. At the same establishment there was also a detached pile, con-
sisting of several plates of China, laid one above the other, and sur-
mounted with a vase bearing the word “Desert,” on a white ground,
and intended to testify to the desert of his Highness the Beadle.
At a small toy-shop near the centre of the Arcade there was a remark-
able ornament, representing a colossal cockroach, having the words
“à la Beadle" on its fore feet, and surmounted by a Éjº staff
encircled by a scroll, on which was written “I’Arcade de Lowther a
BUMBLE II,” in golden letters. At about half-past one the music of the
celebrated Rheumatic Band—so remarkable for its shakes—was heard
in the Strand, and the Band immediately fell in at the corner of the
Arcade, where it fell out with a constable. - -
In the mean time a stream of deputations from all the markets of
London began to congregate at the same spot in the following dis-order.
A band of fish-dealers represented the market of Clare, all carrying
their baskets, one of which was surmounted with a huge representation
of a Whelk inscribed, in the touching patois of the place, with the
simple word “Jelk-'um ” Newport Market came next, represented
by a party of .# boys and old girls—the former wearing blouses, and
the latter bearing large bunches of greens and evergreens.
At a quarter to twº, the old watchmen of the first Beadledom made
their appearance, while the Rheumatic Band struck up “Charley's my
darling ;” and at their rear walked a man with a banner, supposed
to be intended for a portrait of the greatest of all Charlies—the illus-
trious CAROLUs MAGNUs, or CHARLEMAGNE.
At length the hero of the day made his appearance, dressed in the
complete uniform of a General Beadle, with his hat in one hand, and
supported by the brilliant staff already alluded to. The moment he
was seen, the Whelk inscribed “Welk-'um !” was held up to his eyes,
at which he smiled and bowed; and each of the market-women
presented to him a small bouquet of water-cress, which he held in his
hand for some time till he ate a portion, and pocketed the remainder.
A young girl then came forward with scimething in her hand, and the

by standers would have kept her off, but the Beadle, waving them back,
stooped down and received a sweetmeat, known as Bon APARTE's ribs,
which he pressed to his heart, and then put to his lips, very fervently,
during the rest of the day's proceedings.
In the meantime the Beadle made his way through the Arcade,
where he was received in the most enthusiastic manner.
In the centre of the Arcade the Beadle drew up opposite his own
watch-box, and released from it a boy who had been confined there
during the morning for disturbing the public tranquillity, by raising the
cry of “Lul-li-e-te”—a cry associated with such tristes souvenirs to the
party of order. This act of clemency had the best ºffect; but it yet
remains to be seen how the other Arcades—or foreign powers—will
receive the establishment of hereditary Beadledom in the BUMBLE
family. The Burlington autocrat will not, it is, supposed, make any
hostile demonstration, unless an attempt should be made to extend the
Lowther boundaries with a view to the ultimate annexation of the
Arcade-dom of Exeter. The independence of this small constitutional
Beadledom is thought to be so essential to the balance of power, that
any outrage on its flag by invading its pavement would at once call
forth a remonstrance from foreign Courts, among which St. Martin's
Court would be the most Fºl.
At the conclusion of the ceremony His Highness retired, amidst
enthusiastic shouts of “Pive BUMBLE II,” while the Rheumatic Band
layed a favourite air, and minute guns—the minutest that could be
ound in the local toy-shops—discharged repeated volleys of nothing, in
honour of the occasion.

THE BOTTLE TRICK.
This trick—prophesied by SIRJAMEs GRAHAM
to come off on the opening of Parliament—will,
it is affirmed, be executed, although with a
difference. MR. DisBAELI has already made it
known to the astonished EARL OF DERBy that
he—the CHANCELLOR OF THE FXCHEQUER-
cannot go into the bottle. He has looked at the
bottle—considered it in many lights—measured
his height and bulk against the vitreous vessel,
and declares that he is altogether too big for the
trick, in fact, quite above it. The EARL of DERBY
was of course somewhat astonished at this avowal
of his lieutenant, inasmuch as the chivalrous
EARL believed that a Minister, to keep his place,
might make himself small enough to enter into
any measure. “And was the bottle trick to be
wholly abandoned?” “Not so,” answered the
astute, the enlightened, DISRAELI. “It is my
intention”—(mind, reader; Punch only gives
this private and confidential conversation upon
rumour)—“it is my intention to take off the
resent duties on French wines. Thus, if a man
uy two bottles of wine for the present price of
one bottle—shall I not, though with a beautiful
difference, make a quart of wine enter where
before there could only be a pint?” It is said
that LoRD DERBy—in his emotion wholly for-
#. his rank, quite oblivious of the tremendous
ifference between his high blood and the mere
ink of the literary Chancellor—embraced MR.
DISRAELI with a fervour and sincerity only known
to Prime Ministers.
It is also said that the great and gallant
Secretary-at-War has expressed himself much
disgusted at the influence obtained, and held by
the bookman Chancellor over the cock-fighting
Prime Minister. “Isn’t it dreadful”—our Sec-
retary has asked—"isn't it awful, and dangerous
to the brightest jewels of the Crown, which is the
Established Church and the Throne, that one of
the rabble of Faternoster Row should be trusted
with the Exchequer? And then, to think an ink-
stand should climb above a coronet!” And
then in a deep, somewhat pathetic, but very
confidential whisper, he has added at the club,
being at the time far from the low editor that
“the conditions of society” sometimes seat
cheek-by-jowl with him “on the same sofa”-
then has BERESFORD added, “but the fact is

PUTTING HIS
COCKERSDALE CHEMISTRY.
MR. W. RADLey, of Cockersdale Chemical Works, Leeds, writes to
the Galway Erecrator altogether trumping the editor's late motion of
destroying Saxon armies by means of steam-engines hurling upon them
masses of stone as big as Irish cabins. Such things are but as sugar-
lums, compared to the Cockersdale chymicals: for the exterminating
ADLEY writes:
“I can prepare a liquid, a pint of which in a Glass Grenade-shell, thrown through a
Barrack Window in the night would silently extinguish the whole of its living
inhabitants, or broken in the face of an advancing Force, Horse or Foot matters not
with the Wind in their teeth must infallibly arrest their progress by death or
Paralysis.”
However, “for the sake of humanity,” RADLEY will not name “this
terrible compound.” Otherwise what blessed benefits might he confer
upon England! About a thousand pints of this awful liquid in glass
grenades would suffice to guard our coast against all comers; allowing
them, perhaps, quietly to land, and then “extinguishing” them on the
beach to be duly used as manure by the English farmer. Or a few
gun-boats—their º: removed and replaced by Pint Glass Grenades—
would “extinguish” the crews of the Austerlitz or the Napoleon, with
the five thousand fighting-men aboard
It must be an awful liquid'. RADI.EY is, indeed, the real Bottle Imp!
What can the liquid be Is it merely a stronger concentration of the
ink used in the office of the Galway Erecrator £ Is it prepared from
the poison-sacs of the reptiles of %. ?—for that reptiles do now
abound, despite the once acted miracle of St. PATRICK, nobody who
reads certain Irish leaders can doubt.
We have it. Eureka!... We have it. All the world, knows, the
episcopal cooings of the “Dove of Galway.” If pigeons have milk—
and it is proved, they do secrete a sort of lacteal fluid wherewith to
soften food for their young—if pigeons have milk, so of course have
doves. Then have we no doubt whatever, from the destructive para:
lysing energy of RADLEY's liquid, that it is composed of the printed and
written exhortations of the Dove of Galway !

figure. Any one purchasing the “right little tight, little” affair of an
island will of course buy a box of bricks for fortifications, some tin
soldiers for military, a few brass cannons for artillery, and, by way of
introducing the sports of the turf, he may possess himself of the famous
“Game of the Steeple-Chase.” We regret that we were not aware of
this eligible opportunity, that we might have forwarded a five-pound

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,

PUNCH ON THE HAIR.
THE title of Punch on the Hair may probably
-N § have a startling effect on the reader from
§§ its affinity to Punch on the Head, but we
Fº are quite sure we shall have the attention
º Sº of both sexes of the human race when we
intimate that we are about to take in hand
the public hair, and put it into one or two
papers. The importance of the sub-
ject willbeadmitted on all hands, for
how many are they who have given
their heads to hair, with the view
of securing a vigorous crop of hair
to the heads of the community.
How much innocent grease has
been shed in the perpetual
slaughter of bear after bear, and,
indeed, it may be said that the
human hair has for many years
been watered by the blood of that
fatally fat-secreting animall -
The importance of the hair is
admitted by all, for there is scarcely
a human being, however negligent
in other matters, who is not “par-
ticular to a hair,” in reference to
what the poet of the pomatum
pot or the bear's grease bard has
described as “Nature's chiefest
* i. f is di
As a horse's age may be told by his teeth, the age of a man is, dis;
closed by his ;: or º: by # want of it, for a bald head is a bald
fact, speaking the naked truth by a sort of negative evidence, Time is
continually pulling at our hair to remind us of his flight, and when he
does not actually pull our hair out by the roots, his iron hand leaves the
marks of that iron grey, which accords with the evening of life, the
grey twilight of existence. - - - -
He who would preserve his hair should bear in mind the principle ºf
“cut and come again,” for the hair, like an acquaintance, that will
not be cast off, seems by the very process of cutting to be invited
back again. - -
Let us now say a word on the properties of hair, and we entreat the
reader not to let his hair stand on end when we tell him that it is com-
posed of lime, flint, iron, oil, and sulphur. When the lover, pleads for
a lock as a gage d'amour, he is in imploring a phosphate of one
thing and a carbonate of another at the hands of his mistress. Different
coloured hair, has different qualities, and though we cannot read the
character in black and white—for we may be deceived by a wig-we
may get at a few general heads by the contemplation of heads in general,
}; hair is loaded with iron, and denotes therefore a hard-headed
man, and, indeed, it is said that each separate hair is a complete tube,
which may, in the case of black hair, be regarded as a sort of iron pipe
for carrying off the perspiration and other useful purposes, Red hair
has a §. oil, in its composition, but, according to a learned old
writer, “red hair is often he red-hair-tary, and tarries in a family.’
It is a curious fact that the youngest infant and the oldest man are
usually quite bald—a proof that extremes will meet : even in the
knocking together, as it were, of the heads of helpless babyhood
and equally helpless senility. -- - - - -
To promote #. growth of hair on a baby it is necessary to give him
constant wipes on the head with the coarsest towel. These wipes
should be followed up by fequent cuts, in order to render them
thoroughly effectual. For cleaning the hair a brush is better, than a
comb, the teeth of which irritate the hair and render it snappish, for it
frequently snaps off under such harsh treatment. . - -
Perhaps the best way of ensuring a truly luxuriant head of hair is to
purchase it of your hair-dresser, for in that case if your hair falls off
you have only to put it on again. -
Baldness may be attributed to various causes, of which reluctance to
purchase or to wear a wig is the most usual. There are various receipts
for restoring the hair, but the following receipt, of which we possess
the original, is the only one that can be relied on for thoroughly supply-
ing the loss of hair in a case of baldness.
RECEIPT.
Received of SAMUEL Smooth PATE, Esq., one pound eleven and sixpence
for a new horse-hair wig of horse-chesnut.
Bear's Grease is highly recommended for the hair, but when a hair-
dresser has the impertinence to tell us our hair is getting thin, and to
recommend his own grease, we refuse to patronise the bear on the
premises.
The naturalist would be much puzzled to know the bear by his
grease as sold at the perfumers' shops, and would infer the existence of
a race of bears belonging to the hog tribe, and yielding their lard in
abundance to the london hair-dressers. A metropolitan bear would
seem, by chemical analysis, to melt down into bees’-wax, spermaceti,
and pig's fat—for such is the bear’s grease of commerce: while some few
of the most recently slaughtered hair-dressers', bears would seem to
yield a compound of beef marrow, mixed with the lard of the hog
and mutton suet.
. Curling the hair with irons is a practice often fatal to the hair, and,
indeed, if we had a beautiful head of hair we would not touch it with a
pair of tongs on any account whatever. Where nature refuses to do us
the good turn of curling our hair, we prefer leaving it in rat's tails to
tell its own ºf
Some people have such an antipathy to grey or white hair, that they
would rather dye than allow it to bear whiteness to their age, and the
resort to all sorts of expedients for making white appear black, º:
is in the long run quite impossible.
The only safe mode of dyeing the hair is to use a lead comb, but any
One resorting to this process must have such a lead mine in his own
head, that an ordinary comb might answer all the purpose.
RIGHT TO A T.
THE Silent Club, early in the last century, piqued itself (like our own
House of Commons) on avoiding all needless speech. A certain newly
received member, on being introduced, wrote down the previous
number of his colleagues, and then modestly prefixed a cipher for him-
self, to show that there was an addition, but no increase of value. The
President responded with a compliment—he removed the cipher to the
other end of the figures, to indicate that the club now considered itself
of tenfold value. -
MR. John BULL intends shortly to emulate these feats of silence.
When MR. DISRAELI presents him with his “Budget,” MR. BULL will
merely strike out the final letter of the word. MR. bisºn and his
. will understand that they have received directions for their
next move.
A Housemaid's Jubilee.
THE Gloucester Journal has the following puzzling paragraph:—
* The second Mop, which came off on Monday last, was, contrary to precedent, more
fully attended than the first, owing, doubtless, to the dry weather, which did not
prevail on the former occasion.”
We don't know what a “Mop” may be, but we should say there
was no reason why the historian of the above large attendance should
congratulate himself upon the , dryness of the weather, for even
supposing the rain had fallen in buckets, the people would have been
perfectly prepared for it with so good a “Mop” in hand.

THE French have at length actually deified Louis NAPOLEon. The
last title which they have conferred on him is, “Le Messie du 2
Decembre.” We suppose that henceforth our “versatile neighbours.”

RAILWAY RAILLERY.
AN atrocious Chairman of a Railway Board, in reference to the
general complaints of mismanagement against himself and colleagues,
says, that the public may take the indignant line of rail if they please;
but that, his Company mean quietly to pursue their own. The man
who would hazard a joke like that, would also risk a collision.
“The Empire is Peace.”
WE have been kindly informed by the future Emperor of France,
that the “Empire is Peace.”. We are glad to hear this; but then, we
have only Louis NAPOLEON's word for it. We must say, without
wishing to be too magisterial, that we doubt so small a surety for
keeping the peace.
WINKING BRITISH ART-Rimini may boast of its winking picture;
but so will, Exeter, should that city ever possess a portrait of the

original, it will wink hard at auricular confession.

NEW PATTERN FOR MANCHESTER
E are sorry that we were
prevented, by political
engagements of the high-
est, importance to our
native land and every
other, from assisting at
the late meeting of the
Sheffield School of De-
sign; for we had a sug-
gestion to make there—
a suggestion that might
even have embellished
the speech of the DUKE
of NewcasTLE.
You may have ob-
served that certain rapid
and brilliant young men
affect shirt-fronts deco-
rated with the figures of
ballet girls—as if to sig-
nify how near are the
originals to their hearts.
The pattern might be
diversified, with cigars
and goes of º since
our young friends take
these also to their bosoms
-but this is not our sug-
gestion for the School of
Design: what we would
recommend to the notice
of that institution is a
new style of ornament for the smarter kind of female apparel.
As men of fast impulses regard the performances of coryphées, so
may young ladies of quick sensibilities take an interest in the industry
of milliners; and rejoice accordingly in dresses adorned with miniatures
of the dress-makers. Flowered prints are pretty; yet variety is charm-
ing: and there are flowers of the garret that would look prettier than
flowers of the nosegay : under the healthy conditions of sun and
air necessary to bring out their colour. A dress figured with forms of
such flowers—to wit, mice-looking little needle-women—would be
§ charming—deserve most emphatically to be called a love and a
uck.
But it would be quite necessary that this embellishment of vesture

LATEST DODGE—FROM BETTING OFFICE To

§ –Any one that can be got.
1865
The remainder of the anticipations are, as was
always, aid of the French Telegraph, “Interroman par
le brouillard.” But we think it is a prodigious effort of
foresight to have seen even so far and so clearly as the
above into the future of French History. There are
many bold Loomers-ir-the-l)istance who would be
afraid to prophesy what would be likely to occur in
France during the next two years. Now, our antici-
pations have carried us safely over a period of fifteen
years. Beyond that date we dare not, with all our rash-
ness, foretell what will take place, unless, perchance, it
is a State of Perpetual Revolutions !
should express the truth—that the illustrations should be copied from
Nature—taken, faithfully, from blooming life. It would not do for
those who stood for the portraits to have been squalid, pallid, sickly,
wretched-looking objects. For then the wearer of the costume so orna-
mented would go about attired in irony; literally clothed with satire as
with a garment: would be a promenading sarcasm, and a polking,
waltzing quiz. -
Now, unfortunately, under existing circumstances, the novelty which
we have been proposing cannot be produced. Veracity forbids, the
introduction of the article. Nor, whilst girls of tender age are pent up,
by thousands, from twelve to twenty hours per day, mantua-making in
attics and carbonic acid, will it be possible, truly and honestly, to manu-
facture the goods.
Having a sharp eye to business, therefore, we are glad to see that
an Association has been formed at Manchester for the Improvement of
the Condition of Dressmakers and Milliners; a meeting of which
society took place the other evening in Cooper Street at the Mechanics'
Institution: its object being to induce the community to “discounte-
nance late ºpini late working, and the transaction of (late) business
on Saturdays.” It is very probable that employers and principals
of establishments may have conscience and humanity enough to make
some suitable arrangement among themselves to this end. Herein, too,
we may hope they will receive every encouragement from the ladies,
who-all compassion, sympathy, and sisterly affection—want only the
least considerate thought to afford it strenuously.
Impertinent and prosy sages are accustomed to remind the fair sex
that the silks which they esteem such splendid raiment, are woven from
“the bowels of a º worm; ” unpleasant twaddle, which the fair
sex wisely disregards. Never mind the interior of silkworms—but the
milliner's thorax is another matter: and it may be proper, if not
agreeable, to advertise those whom it may concern that they are very
likely clad in the product of consumptive human vitals—an infectious
clothing, moreover, some doctors think. There may be sympathy
enough to catch disease where there is not enough to commiserate
suffering: and caution, if not kindness, may suggest the advisableness
of improving the condition of dress-makers: which, improved, our new
dress of the mantua-maker pattern will be possible. But should this
commercial design fail, it will still be something if that of the
Manchester, Association simply shall succeed; and a general early
closing of dress-making business abate a general early closing of
dress-making existence.

THE Printing Press in Chancery!
but as a conqueror.
..Qh Sugpº N–SUGDEN' You wrote a book “on Powers,” but little

hand, broad margins, copying clerks, copies, and the rest of that awful
and costly machinery of word-spinning, by the introduction of printed
bills and claims, drawn in forms no longer than are necessary, and in
º intelligible to clients as well as conveyancers and councillors.
f all the mighty services the Printing Press was ever ordered cn,
this is surely among the mightiest.
IN CHANCERY |
Don't be afraid—not as a client,
. It has maicted into Courts, and absolutism has retired before it:
into. Cabinets, aud, diplomacy has shrunk into insignificance: into
Palliaments, and public opinion has become greater than Ministers.
. But hitherto Qhancery was barred against it—Mystification, Procras-
tination, Amplification, Reduplication, and Obscuration still sat there,
guiding the pens of the law stationers, and twisting folio after folio of
yerbiage round a case, that it toºk years to unwind, and wrapping up
facts in skins of parchment, till clients, conveyancers, councillors, chan.
cellors and all lost sight of 'em, and had to spend years in hunting out
what they had spent years in hiding away.
And at last into this sanctuary of verbiage and chicane comes the
Printing Press, intrºduced by FDward BURTENshaw Sugden, LoRD
St. LEONARDs-let his name be given at full length—and so surely as
that conquering machine has penetrated here, so surely will cheapness,
simplicity, and clearness follow in its train.
Fresh Symptoms of the New-mania.
DR. NEWMAN, in ecstacies over the subscriptions that have been
sent over to him from France to defray the expenses of the AcHILLI
trial says most meekly:
“I am surprit d at seeing myself the object of such sympathies, and I think I may,
without presumption, believe that the glorious St. Denis, who presided over my
reception into the bosom of Catholicism, has, as it were, presented me a second time to
the embraces of the Church by recommending me to the tender charity of the great
nation of which he is the apostle.”
Mcst sweet embraces that are accompanied with a douceur of £1,000!
We are sure it is most kind of St. DENIs to take such affectionate care
9f his disciples, but we want to know why he didn't show this kindness
in the first instance? Why didn't he win the trial for DR. NewMan?
It strikes us it would have been a much simpler and cheaper plan—
instead of losing the trial, and paying the expenses of it afterwards !

“Whither has liberty in Paris fled?”
Cries Dick,-"You’ll find her at the Morgue,” says NFD.
THE CONWICTS OF FLORENCE.
(FRANcisco AND Rosa MADIAI convicteD OF RELIGIOUs conviction.)
PETTY tyrant of Tuscany-glorious, indeed,
Is the blunder you’ve made in the night of your creed;
Ne'er did you so precious a wrong in your life,
As dooming the Protestant husband and wife.
So this is your Church—this her tender rebuke
When she uses the strength of her slave—a GRAND DUKE!
Your Church—all so loving, so meek, so benign,
As we’re brazenly told by each shaven divine.
Who doubts, could your papacy have its own way,
Each city would hiss with an auto da féf
And who but a bigot or fool would give scope
To the truculent beadledom topp'd by your Pope.
What, snug in their dungeons, you calmly fuppose,
Tormented unheard are poor FRANCIs and Rose ?
No, Leopold ! Europe resounds with their cry;
And sees Rome's alleged toleration a Lie.
There once was a time—could it only return!
When Popery, grinning, could scourge, rack, or burn,
And the shriek of mad pain, and the agonised yell,
Was bounded by market-place—stifled in cell.
That time is no more; screams of anguish, at least,
Are no private concert for GRAND DUKE or Priest;
That sound now goes forth to the ends of the earth,
And what is your triple-crown'd tyranny worth
How long shall destructive wrath linger behind
The roused indignation of outraged mankind?
And the falsehood, renounced by the heart and the brain,
The strong hand of the nations suffice to restrain?
Be that as it may, Tuscan Flunkey of Rome,
Much thanks for the lesson you’ve taught us at home,
Where a hypocrite gang, of your kidney, pretends
To stand forth as Religious Equality's #iends.
Oh, thanks for the fact, which with bluster and brogue
When bellows or whines each contemptible rogue,
We can fling in his face, with a laugh of disdain!
Let him only feel that—not the least other pain.
THE CHINESE COURT CIRCULAR.
His MAJESTY, after breakfast, manufactured a paper kite, and went
into the imperial Gardens to fly it. The tail not being sufficiently
heavy, His Majesty was graciously pleased to cut of the pigtail of one
of his mandarins, and to tie it on with his own hands. This had the
desired effect, and the flying of the kite was the admiration of all
beholders. His Majesty afterwards relaxed his mind by playing at
coach-and-horses with his Ministers. At one o'clock His Majesty went
out birds'-nesting. At two. His Majesty returned, when the birds'-
nests, which His Majesty had had the gracious inspiration of the moon
to find, were served up for His Majesty's luncheon. The Chinese
bell-ringers performed during the repast. After luncheon. His Majesty,
:*by his whole army, went out on horseback to enjºy an
hour's sport of cat-hunting. No less than three brace of the finest
Toms ſº. the unerring aim of His Majesty's bow and arrow... His
Majesty was pleased to direct that the game should be sent with his
gracious compliments and a basket of golden apples to the Governor of
all the Tartars. In the afternoon His Majesty was melted to give an
audience to a French artist, who proceeded to take a Daguerreotype
of His Majesty's Imperial countenance. His Majesty; however, ".
being shown the result, was so irate at the ugliness of the likeness, that
he ordered the artist's head to be instantly cut off, and decreed that the
diabolical machine, which had assisted him, in the insult, should be
ublicly whipt three times a day until His Majesty's further pleasure.
is Majesty then went to dinner.
Such are the particulars of the “Chinese Court Circular.” Circum-
stances so trivial used formerly to be rarely found in the Gazette, but
now they are inserted with great minuteness to prove to His Majesty's
loving subjects that the mind of Twan-KAY is no less vigorous than his
body, and that, in spite of rumours to the cºntrary their august and
beloved monarch still retains possession of all his faculties: From a
Hong-Kong Paper.

WHAT THE CELT DOES, AND WHAT THE
SAXON DOES.
(As seen with the eyes of an Irishman.)
The Celt pays his debts—never owes a farthing to any man; but the
h º cannot stir from home without having a sheriff's officer at his
eels.
The Celt pays his rent to the very day; but the dastardly Saxon is
ways in arrear, and, if he discharges his rent at all, it is by means of
! * which he fires at his landlord from behind a hedge, more shame
o him :
The Celt is always industrious; but you will find the lazy Saxon, at
any hour of the day, leaning, against a post, with his hands in his
ſº. (not that there is anything in them to feel), and a short pipe in
is mouth, looking the very picture of impudence and laziness!
The Celt has generally a decent coat on his back; but the blackguard
Saxon always appears like a scarecrow that had just walked out of a
corn-field.
The Celt, is most cleanly in his habits, and prefers living without
animals in the room—but #. into the house of the dirty Saxon, and
you will find it to consist of one filthy room, into which the children, and
the pigs, and the cow, and the good lady, and the poultry, and the old |
. and the donkey are all crammed, without any regard to order and
ecency.
The Celt is frugal, and always, has something put by for a rainy day;
but the improvident Saxon spends every farthing he has (though it’s not
many of them he gets) at the whisky-shop.
The Celt loves quiet, and rarely moves from his fireside, where he
minds the kettle, or rocks the cradle, or helps the good Missus in washing
up the tay-things, but if there's a row, go into it by all means, and if
there are ten men with broken heads, you may be sure that nine of
them are Saxons, and the tenth one is a poor Celt's that has been
broken by them—the mean blackguards!
The Celt is of that persevering indomitable nature, that if he sees a
º in his way he puts his shoulder instantly to the wheel, and
removes it—but the poor weak. Saxon is disheartened by the smallest
obstacle, and, at the first impediment that checks him, sits down by the
roadside, and begins crying that no one will help him.
Lastly, the Celtis the bone and muscle, the arms and legs, and head
of the country, that makes all its labour, and wealth, and grandeur-
and the Saxon is the mouth and stomach of the country that consumes
as much as you will give to it, and in return produces nothing but
poverty and discontent.
England owes everything to the Celt—but the Saxon owes every-
thing to England, and, what is more, is never likely to pay a farthing
of it.
Poor Living.
THE Mayor of St. Cloud begins an address to Louis NAPOLEON with
the following startling fact in the annals of national starvation:
“Prince,—France has lived on one single idea during the last month."
The above poor diet may account, then, for the present weakness of
|France. Poor country! how can it Fº hold its head up amongst
the nations of Europe, when it only gets one idea a month? How.
ever, there may be a motive in keeping its strength down. France has
not stronger food given to it, as the object, doubtlessly, is to keep the
country as low as possible in order to prevent its rising.

PUNCH. Olę. THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 195
THE SABBATARIANS AT SION COLLEGE
* F see that the Morn-
| º ing Post reports a
| “Great Meeting of
III. the Clergy” which
- took place on Thurs-
day, last week, at Sion
College
“To consider in what
manner the clergy may
best express their opinion
upon the encouragement
which will be given to in-
creased desecration of the
Sabbath, if the Crystal
Palace, now erecting at
Sydenham, shall be opened
as a place of public recrea-
tion on the Lord's Day.”
“The WENERABLE
ArchDEACON HALE
- presided,” sa’s our
--> --> - sº - fashionable contempo-
ū; - - -> rary, and then pro-
ceeds to tell us what
the Archdeacon, and sundry of his reverend brethren said. But we are a'raid that the
Morning Post abridged the discourses of these divines shamefully—omitt. d, for example,
to publish certain remarks by ARCHDeAcon HALE: which we supply by conjecture.
The Venerable Archdeacon said that it had been asserted that Sunday was the only
day which afforded the working man leisure for recreation. That might be; but was
recreation necessary for the working man P. He contended that it was not absolutely
necessary. He never did himself, nor caused to be done by others, any work on the Sunday
that was not strictly necessary. If he allowed himself any enjoyment he could possibly do
without, he should consider himself a gross hypocrite to want to close the Crystal Palace
to the labouring classes on that day. Port wine was not a necessary of life. He on no
account ever drew, or allowed his butler to draw a cork on Sunday, except for the purpose
of sending a glass of wine to the sick poor. He need not say that he dined off, cold meat on
the Sabbath, invariably; and never ate vegetables because they required cooking, but con:
tented himself with bread and pickles. He might add that i. always made a point of
shaving himself at half-past eleven on Saturday night, that he might be innocent of a super-
fluous use of the razor on Sunday morning.
º speech of a Rev. Mr. ShokT, as given by the Post, contains a profound query,
namely:-
“What kind of Sabbath would it be which was spent at church in the morning, and in amusement in the
rest cf the day?”
But the Post does not tell us how the REv. M.R. Short proceeded to answer his own
question, which we imagine he did somewhat after the manner following:— -
The Rev. Gentleman continued—It would be a very different Sabbath from that which the
labouring classes spent now. It would be passed in drinking—that is, in drinking with the
tyes: which was just as bad as swilling beer and gin. They all knew how mechanics and
artisans generally spent Sunday at present. It was in holy meditation. The mind would
act when the hands were unemployed. Different journeymen and workpeople pondered on
different things. One sat endeavouring to form ideas of celestial beatitude. Another examined
his conscience-Bible in hand—all day. Another lost himself in admiring the wonderful
consis' ency of the preachers of humility and self-denial with their practice; and in marvelling
at the spiritual riches of the Bishops and superior clergy. That was the occupation of many,
who, to the superficial observer, appeared to be sitting at their windows in their shirt-sleeves
with a pipe, a pot of beer, and a profane newspaper.
We find the celebrated and Rev. DR. CroLY represented as saying—
“The Crystal Palace Company wanted to compromise matters by only opening the building after one o'clock,
and by selling no spirituous liquors. The consequence would be, the morning congregations at church would
rush from there to the railway station to get tickets for the Crystal Palace.”
Surely DR. CROLY explained this seemingly strange logic. It must be supposed that
The Rev. DR. Choly proceeded to say that in the inference he had just drawn he might
not appear to have been c.2) sequential. He had indeed, a small opinion of his own con-
sequence: indeed, this humility it was which led him to that very conclusion he had drawn.
It did appear absurd to suppose that people who went to church—of course to he taught their
". there—would be apt to rush thence to the railway station. But, alas! he despaired
of his power to persuade them not to do so. He felt that it required abilities greater than
his own to prove that the Christian Sunday was the Jewish Sabbath. Legislative coercion,
therefore, must supply the deficiency of clerical rhetoric.
It is quite true that the meeting, as the Morning Post states, resolved, that it viewed
the proposed opening of the Crystal Palace “with horror and alarm; ” but the Morning
Post does not add, as no doubt it might have done, that these clergymen equally voted their
alarm and horror at the idea of all Sunday enjoyment in the Palace of a Bishop.
Since writing the above, we have seen the Times report of the same meeting, which is
flattering to our powers of clairvoyance, though it shows that in exercising them, we made,
as seers usually do, a slight mistake. We ascribed the remark that recreation was unnecessary
for labouring men to ARchneacon HALE. This enlightened position, it seems, is the prope ty
of DR. Choly: who, the Times tells us, spake on this wise—according to his wisdom:—
"I shall be told that the humbler orders, and those who are confined to trade all the week, require amusement
to refresh them. I cannot accede to this; the proper refreshment is rest, according to the original command."
The Times is mure cºpious than our other contemporary in its account of the Sion oratory,
but we fear that it, also, left many of the rational,
sensible, and truly religious observations of the
various speakers, unrecorded. The additional
links in the chain of Choly’s “linked sweet-
ness,” which it discloses, indicate yet more ;
as the sight of another convolution or two of
the sea-serpent might suggest no end of his tail.
We perceive that, in contrast with his appalling
picture of the people rushing out of church at
one o'clock to the Sydenham train, rushing for
tickets, rushing for seats, rushing to the Ex-
hibition, “there” wickedly, “to spend the next
three or four hours "
“In mingling with an immense multitude, dressed in
their best, laughing, and looking, and chatting in the fullest
excitement of every day life; among groups of statues, and
galleries of picnres, and curious works of art, and fine
fountains, and showy architecture :-"
We perceive, we say, that
The REv. DR CRoly eloquently described
the piºus spectacle now presented every Sunday
in Hyde Park, thronged as it was by Rank and
Fashion, weaning their thoughts from vanities
in their splendid equipages, wherein they exhi-
bited themselves in honour of the day; whilst
horsemen, devoting their thoughts to eternity,
pranced by their side, and loungers, edified by
their devotion, contemplated them leaning over
the rails.
Some other resolutions, it is also evident to
us, were passed in addition to those wherein
the meeting objected “to the intellectual cha-
racter of the pursuits" which they feared would
be offered to the public at the Crystal Palace;
and expressed, their apprehension that “the
precedent of the enlightened pursuits of the
Crystal Palace” would “be urged as a reason
for opening museums, and libraries, and gal-
leries of art in other places than the Metro-
polis.” The reverend and sapient assembly—
without question—also resolved—
“Ihat no attention but such as may be autho-
rise i by the clergy of the Archdeaconry of
Middlesex ought to be paid to the example of
any Person or Persons related to have walked
in the fields, and to have gathered, or suffered
to be gathered, corn on the Sabbath Day.
“That the Sabbath was Not made for man, but
man for the Sabbath.
“That it shall be the endeavour of this meet-
ing to get all streets containing public buildings
of any architectural pretensions, or adorned with
any sculpture (of a secular uature), closed on
Sundays.
“That a contract should be entered into by
the Commissioners of Sewers with the proper
parties, to make such arrangements with respect
to drainage as may secure a London fog for
every Sunday throughout the year.”
It mus' also be added, that to the vote of
thanks to the Wenerable Chairman was added a
vote of admiration for the miraculous ability
with which he fil's all his preferments at once.
The (Dancing) Master of France.
CERTAINLY the patron saint of Louis NAPo-
LEON's late progress mus', have been St. Witus,
for in almost every town he stopped at the cere-
monies of his reception ... with a dance.
In fact his “progress” was a series of hops,
and the chief steps taken to ensure its success
were those of the polka, galop, or quadrille.
Evidently His Highness wished to “dance into
good favour,” and to show his faithful subjec's
that he had the ball completely at his foot.

196 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE VISION OF ST. PATRICK HIS PURGATORY.
BRIAN Boroo, a repentant Agitator, to the Blessed PUNCH, the dweller by the ancient Well of Saint Bridget, sendeth greeting:—
N my eyes, with tear-drops streaming, still the golden gates
are gleaming; still the crystal columns beaming, bright
,, . and clear, before me lie;
Still fair maidens, each the bearer of a golden harp, far rarer than
the ancient harp of Tara, make a wondrous melody.
Was it sooth or, was it seeming * Did I wake? or, was I
dreaming? Did a brain, with fancies teeming, raise the
. . vision to mine eye,
Which, in Patrick's Purgatory, shewed me all the power and
glory that, in spite of Whig or Tory, shall be Erin's—Bye
and Bye?
Many a year, in factions trading, quiet, peaceful men upbraiding,
quacks, with lip and pen still aiding, I had pass'd my
public life,
Leagued with every fresh impostor; who, no matter what it cost
her, would have forced our land, and lost her, in some foul
rebellious strife;
But, with riper age, reflection brought to faithful recollection
much that would not bear inspection by a rightly judging
mind,
And I said, “For many a season I have utter'd grievous treason
'gainst all common sense and reason; what atonement
may I find?
I will take my staff, and travel shoeless over flint and gravel to
Lough Derg, and seek the cave all lonely on its sacred isle,
Where, if faith be due to story, is SAINT PATRick's Purgatory;”
and without delaying more, I did so—weeping all the while.
All around the cave is dreary; and as I, depress'd and weary, to
its gloomy mouth drew near, I felt my courage almost fail.
Of the echoes round me flying, some were swearing, some were
lying ; some in cuckoo tones kept crying in my ear, “Re-
pale ! Repale l’”
Seemed that some, a tocsin ringing, made to GAvAN DUFFY's
singing fitting music; some kept flinging taunts they'd
borrow'd from M*HALE ;
Bits of SMITH O'BRTEN's speeches, scraps of all that LUCAs teaches, CAHILL writes,
or CULLEN preaches, rose and sank upon the gale.
Nightshade in the garden glowing said, “The Rose might here be blowing, if I
left her room to grow in.” Fruit-trees tottered to their fall,
All their virtue sapp'd by ivy; here and there an empty hive I saw, but not a bee
alive I º wasps had kill'd them all.
O'er the ancient doorway graven Industry lay bound, and craven Idleness, unwashed,
unshaven, kept her prostrate on the ground;
While, in worse than useless leisure, Lavish Waste and Sinſul Pleasure ruined health
and squandered treasure fast on wassail, horse and hound:
Poverty, by Superstition blinded, followed where Ambition led her swiftly to
Sedition; Fraud and Falsehood hovered round; - -
Murder in a corner slinking, from the glare of daylight shrinking, with a sullen scowl
sat thinking where its victim might be found.
Through the gloomy portal pacing, soon as I had stepp'd the place in, elders twain,
severe of face, in chairs on either side I saw;
Seem’d, when I came near to view 'em, by their crooks full well I knew 'em ; they
were DUBLIN hight, and TUAM, and they said, “We foes of law—
We, of endless feuds th’ inventors, here are chosen chief tormentors: every mortal
here who enters must abide our dread behest.”
Then, “Oh, Reverend Elders " said I, “’Gainst your torments. I am steady; you
shall find me firm and ready for them all, so, do your best!” .
-- Q. ” said TUAM. “Let them take him to the Hall of Tongues, and make him hear such logic as shall shake him, if he never shook
efore.”
Then they made me take my seat in presence of a Monster Meeting where one speaker kept repeating some oft-quoted lines by MooRE,
Till another, quite delighted, vowed if Erin were not righted by the House on such a night, he'd die—or perish—on the floor.
And a !. i. “Isaac NEwton was a pig-faced, ewe-neck’d brute, on whom no faith should e'er take root; on whom no student e'er
should pore;
And all those who, heaven-forsaken, study GALILeo, Bacon, Locke, or HERscHEL, will be shaken sorely by such godless lore.
Yes, my friends, our utter ruin England, with her schools pursuing, teaches us for our undoing ! Ignorant by right of birth
Ye should hug each false opinion; Knowledge strikes at our dominion; up ! and tell each Saxon minion that the sun goes round the earth.”
Presently, 'gainst me to shoot all wordy missiles seem'd to suit all; I was “bloody, base, and brutal,” “rascall scoundrell miscreant rogue !”
“Bigot!”, “despot!” “scorpion!” liar!”—doom'd to everlasting fire, if I would not shout the cry or catchword that was most in vogue.
But 'mid all the senseless babble, bray, bleat, bellow, yelp, hiss, gabble, steadily I faced the rabble rout with firm, unflinching ear,
Though its drum was well nigh broken. Said I, “Guilt must be ywroken ; #. such as I have spoken, 'tis but fair that I should hear.”
Theº TUAM, “Let them take him, and a Connaught landlord make him; then his troubles soon will shake him till for mercy he
shall roar.”
While I thought about replying, lo! I found I had been buying land all round about me lying—bog, and mountain, marsh, and moor
Fences broken ; drains neglected; rents long due to be collected; tenants ripe to be ejected. “Sure! 'twas always so before l’”
Said a tenant, when, on going to his cot, the wind was blowing through the roof the rain and snow into a puddle on the floor,
Whence a dog, pig, cºw, and chicken, pecking, browsing, routing, licking, severally their way were picking to the dunghill at the door.
"Sure! Sir, it was so before,” he said; and still the self-same story met me, day by day, the more I ºf occasion to deplore;
And this odd determination to remain in dirt, starvation, ignorance, and degradation, and each project to ignore
Which could furnish occupation, solace, or alleviation to their suffering, starving nation, vexed me to the very core.

Said I, “Wainly I expect them to improve; I must correct them,
summons, sue, distrain, eject them, since they'll neither work
nor pay,
And * rather live in sorrow, whine and bully, beg and borrow,
than take counsel for the morrow;” and I did so. From that day,
In my rambles many scowling faces of great fellows prowling near me,
with their rusty fowling-pieces, glared with savage eye,
Threatening letters sternly told me for a felon all would hold me, and
had in their list enrolled me soon a bloody death to die; -
But I said, unmoved, uncaring, “Of your efforts be not sparing' 'Tis
but fair that I am sharing woes I oft have caused before.”
Then said TuAM, “Let them take him, and a recreant voter make
him; priestly censures then shall shake him, till our grace he
shall implore!” - - -
Swift a storm of commination fierce, and rabid execration, threatening
excommunication, rose upon the murky air: -
FATHER BURKE cried, “Were you seated 'mid my flock, and with
repeated prayers the tººd of Life entreated, to comply I should
not dare 1” -
FATHER Rourke yelled, "Were you lying on your wretched pallet,
flying; for the priest's last succour crying, Atheist, I’d not be
there 1*
FATHER Toole shrieked, “Were you sleeping on your bier, and all
your weeping friends came to the churchyard creeping, hallowed
grave you should not share l’” -
FATHER BLAke howled, “If before ye died, ye offered all the store
ye hº 'scape from Purgatory, Beast ! you shouldn't buy a
rayer 1*
Twº §. last shot in their quiver. Through my veins there ran a
shiver, for before me flowed a river-black and turbid was its
wave;
And I hurried towards it sadly, thinking as I went, “How gladly, from
these foes who howlso º: in it shali find a grave.”
“Yoicks!” cried TUAM, “Forward, GRADy! Hark on, Murphy' To
him, BRADy! So ho, DALY! Seize him, Thady e'er the
wretch himself shall save.” -
But I cared not for their screaming, for the golden gates were gleaming,
and the crystal columns beaming bright and clear before mine
eye, -
And across the water stealing, thrilling every sense and feeling, came
the glad triumphant pealing of a glorious melody; . .
On the other bank appearing each departed friend of Erin, shouted
Plunge in, never fearing! Glorious visions wait thee here!
Patriot zeal and brave endeavour shall not wholly fail for ever, Erin's
mental bonds to sever, Erin's drooping sons to cheer.” -
So I plunged, and lo! the sighing of the night wind woke me, lying
near the portal: round meflying, mocking echoesseemed to cry-
When I asked in desperation, “Are there hopes of restoration for my
poor degraded nation?”—“Yes, there may be-Bye and Bye.”
At Romsey-commonly called Romsey-on-the-Mud-there is a
Young Man's Improvement Association; and, says a correspondent of
the Hampshire Independent :
“A lecture in connection with the Society was given in our Town Iſan on Tuesday
evening, by the Rºverend Ma. Bugey of winchester, on “The Literature of Fiction.”
The subject was very ably treated, the design of the lecturer being to show that there
might be much amusement in works of that character (harmless in themselves), but
not much sterling information.”
No? Not much sterling information in Aºsop's Fables? not in
Robinson Crusoe Not in ShakspeaRe? Not in—may, where are we to
stop? for who shall say that a parable is not an imaginary narration;
a case put: not necessarily the statement of positive fact, though con-

HOLDING BY A BAD Title.
It has been suggested by a worn-out wag, who gives his mornings
to conundrums and his nights to puns, that Louis Napoleon, instead
of being called Bone-A-PART, should have conferred upon him the title of
GRAB-the-whole.
THE GREAT PUTTER-Down of FREnch Revolutions.—MacADAM.
HOODED SNAKES.
The poison of the cobra-or hooded snake—has been learnedly
discussed, since the death of the poor rash man bitten in the Park. It
is patent, we believe, to all men that there is no poison so virulent as
that secreted under a hood: the hooded snake of all snakes being the
most deadly. Neither can it be tamed or trusted. It is well known
that the jugglers who feign to charm the reptiles with hoods—who
boast a power over them—allowing them to play about their heads and
wind into their bosoms—have first extracted the poison-sac from the
cobra's mouth; or, if they have not removed the venom-bag, they have
suffered the snakes so to exhaust themselves by having irritated them
to bite lower objects, that the poison is exhausted: time being neces-
sary for a new secretion. Any way, however, unless the sac be plucked
clean out, it is a very, very ticklish matter to play with, or place any
confidence in a hooded snake.
History shews us various examples of men who have grasped, and
that, too, with iron fingers the . snake; that twisted and twined,
and with eyes blazing hot as embers that roasted men in the market-
place, burned harmlessly upon him. One MARTIn Luther became
very celebrated for his bold handling of the great hooded snake of his
time: never did it have such a grip; never did it expend so much
of its venom with so little mischief. Shortly after, one HARRY
Tudor grasped the snake with a strong hand; and Elizabeth his
daughter seized the hooded reptile boldly, calmly as Billingsgate
fishwoman would seize an eel.
And, now, in our day, comes forth John BRIGHT. He proposes to
make the hooded snake quite harmless by petting it with pretty words.
He pipes notes of peace to it, as the Indians pipe and play the drum to
make their snakes dance. John BRIGHT-with an honest desire for
religious equality in Ireland—would, in the simplicity of his heart, tis
even a true lower's knot with the hooded snake; but John BRight,
take heed-remember the poison bags. Nevertheless, it may be
reserved to one of the Friends to make for ever harmless the hooded
snake. MR. BRIsco, Owen, writing from Wales, tells how in the
Deccan, where helived once upon a day, the cobra is made innocuous:
“These people have a simple methodofremoving the venomous fangs of this reptile,
one of which is situated in each upper jaw, by teasing the animal and causing it to
bite at a piece of woollen cloth, at the same time sharply withdrawing the cloth, by
which means the fangs are withdrawn.”
Has MR. BRight heard of this remedy? Will he try his cloth; and
will the innocent DR. CAHILL, not in anger but in good faith, bite at
Quaker's drab?

LA SALETTE AT HOME; OR, AN APPARITION
MADE EASY.
THERE is little question about the apparition at La Salette.
Evidently, “something has been seen there,” as the old woman says in
the ghost story; something or somebody. The probability of the occur-
rence may be demonstrated, even to the incredulous British mind.
The apparition alluded to was that of the MADONNA, who manifested
herself on a mountain to a peasant boy and girl, aged 11 and 15 years
respectively; and gave the children a message to the people of France.
It is affirmed by a cloud of Roman Catholic priests; amongst them the
Rev. M.R. Northcote, whose account of the prodigy was published
last week in the Times. The celestial visitant complained to the little
rustics of the prevalence in the nation, of swearing, fast-breaking, and
desecration of holy-days: and commissioned them to declare that these
sins had occasioned the potatoe-rot; and that unless they were repented
of, the corn would go next, a failure also º in the grapes and
. to be followed by a pestilence that would particularly attack
children.
This revelation occurred in 1846. It seems a pity that the French
Revolution was not predicted instead of the failure of the harvest and the
nuts. But if the miracle was not verified by the event, no matter. It
may be sufficiently established in another way. Mark the following
passage in the tale of MR. NoRTHCOTE, describing the style of address
adopted by the holy Personage referred to :—
“In the course of her conversation with the children, she began it in French; but
when she came to speak of the potatoes, they did not know what she was talking
about. The girl was about to interrupt the lady, and ask her what she was talking
about, when the lad [lady ?] interrupted her, guessed her thoughts, and said they did
not understand her. She then repeated her words in the patois of the country, and
continued the whole conversation in the same till the last words, which were French,
when she said, ‘Well, my children, you will take care to cause this intelligence to
pass to my people.’”
We shall quite comprehend the possibility of this event, if we
imagine the prodigy to have occurred in England. La Salette is a
branch of the Alps, 40 or 50 miles from Grenoble, situated in a district
whose inhabitants—observe—speak such a patois, that they do not even
know the French for potatoes. Transfer the venue to England. Fix it
in some county rejoicing in a modification of the QUEEN’s language.
For Alps substitute the South-western Downs; for peasant children a
couple of coetaneous bumpkins: and for La Salette, say, St. Catherine's
Hill, near Winchester, in Hampshire. , Let that ancient and venerable
city once more enjoy a marvellous celebrity, as it did in the days of
thaumaturgic Swith IN. Suppose the legend to be that St. CATHERINE
appeared on her own hill: on the old Roman encampment called after
her name—as that name is pronounced in the neighbourhood. She
descended, then, on Catturn Hill, during the school hours, or the vaca-
tion of the Wykehamite college-boys, who are wont to disport thereon.
GILes FLItch is loitering hard by, in charge of sheep, and BETsy
GAMMON is helping him. The rustic pair, between asleep and awake,
are astounded by a flash of fire, redder than sunshine—or moonshine—
as red, perhaps, as nitrate of strontia could make it. As they rub
their eyes, and gradually regain their senses, they become aware of the
presence of a lady—the Saint of course. St. CATHERINE addresses
them in the following metropolitan language:
“Juvenile specimens of the rural ſº relinquishing awhile
our fleecy charge, I desire you will attend to my observations. I
ament to find that, notwithstanding the praiseworthy exertions of a
zealous clergy, who are not regarded with the reverence I could wish,
demoralization Fºl. in this country to a fearful extent. Hence the
mysterious malady, which, baffling the investigations of the most
profound vegetable physiologists, has invaded the tubers of the potatoe.”
Here the eyes and mouths of the young Anglo-Saxons dilate so
amazingly, as to make it quite clear that they have not understood one
word that has been said—not even the last as pronounced by the
SAINT. They utter inarticulate expressions of bewilderment; or the
pastoral youth exclaims timorously:—
“Plaze, Mum, we dwooan't know whawt 'tis you manes 1"
“Dost n’t.” replies, St. CATHERINE, remembering whom she is
talking to; “dostn't then thee oost now, praps. Tellee whawt; there

So saying, St. CATHERINE vanishes—by degrees—as asserted by her
auditors; who knew not whether they were standing on their heels or
their heads at the time. Somebody, you would think, had appeared to
these bumpkins—as at La Salette—somebody if not some spirit. No one
can say that the apparition of a SAINT is not possible under certain cir-
cumstances. It might even be :::::: where there existed a community
of zealous Saints in the neighbourhood of a population of profane
clowns. Saints, in such cases, would naturally talk patois on finding
that they were not understood, and would be likely to get hung up or
break down in the same, as well if the boors they appeared to were
Clods of an Alpine valley, as if they were Clods of the Walley of Itchen.
LOUIS NAPOLEON'S “AWOWED PRINCIPLES.”
NE of “our own Correspondents,”
speaking of the late suppression
of the National College of Agri-
culture at Wersailles, remarks
with a naïveté that is really quite
refreshing:—
“It is said, with great appearance of
truth, that the suppression of the College
is inconsistent with the avowed princi-
ples of Louis NApoleon to pursue the
course marked out by the Consular and
Imperial Government of his uncle.”
“Inconsistent P”— why, of
course it is: but what of that ?
Surely, “our own” cannot be
ignorant that Louis NAPOLEON's
practice always is “inconsistent
with his avowed principles P."
To “apow "...one thing, and
do its opposite—this is his
Golden Rule: or, rather say, his Brazen one.
STANDING ON HIS RIGHTS.–AND LEFTS.
THERE was once a MEDw1N who made himself known by his conver-
sations with ByRoN, and there is now a MEDWIN, a boot-maker in
Regent Street, who desires to render, himself illustrious by his com-
munications with Panch. It seems that he is the individual whose
“ten guinea outfit” for Australia we lately touched upon; or, being
apropos of boots, we ought, perhaps, rather to say, we recently walked
into. It seems that we have unconsciously trod upon a respectable
tradesman's corns through his boots, by intimating that he deals in
“ready-made articles,” there being, it seems, a distinction between
boots ready made, and boots that are made and ready on the premises.
We did not mention any names, but if the boot fits, and we believe a
MEDwiN boot does generally fit, he, or any one else is quite welcome to
Wi. # : a consummation which any maker of boots may most devoutly
Wisnior.
A NEW EXBIIBITION.
As soon as the success of the “Wellington Campaigns” is exhaus'ed,
it will be succeeded by an exhibition of the “Louis Napoleon
CAMPAIGNs.” They will comprise:
1. The Boulogne campaign, with the live eagle and the bit of raw
beef stuck on the cocked ha'.
2. The Strasburg campaign, with the real NAPOLEoN costume
3. The 10th of April campaign, attended with the special constable's
staff.
4. The Plain of Satory campaign, with the distribution of wine and
sausages. - - -
5. The Boulevards campaigns will be omitted as being too terrible
for any but an Exhibition of Savages.
Punch to Doctor Cahill.
MR. PUNCH presents his compliments to Doctor CAHILL, and begs
to call his notice to these lines in his letter to the EARL OF DERBy :-
“If you gave me fair play, my Lord, if you do not set your Times, and your Globe,
and your Standard, and your Punch, to ridicule and abuse me—"
Mr. Punch begs to say that it is very likely he cannot, at the desire
of Lord DeRBY, afford any ridicule for Doctor CAHILL, as he will no
doubt need all his stock for LoRD DERby himself.

that a Bill-Sticker will stick up for any side that will pay him.
A poor unfortunate has, it is said, been lately held to bail for
º an anti-militia bill, though, perhaps, the self-same individual
ad, within a few minutes, been pasting up a placard inviting “fine
oung men” to join the gallant band; and ** is but little doubt that
if he were asked to stick up a broadside, offering a reward for his own
apprehension, he would undertake the job on the shortest notice.
Everybody knows that if a Bill-Sticker were for one moment to become
a party man, his occupation wºuld be gone; and he accordingly merges
his politics in his paste-pot. To him it is a matter of indifference what
the Government may do: the only Bills in which he feels an interest
being those that require sticking. He cares not to watch the stages
at which a Bill in the House may have arrived, but he is anxious that
every Bill shºuld be printed, in order that he may have an opportunity
of submitting it out of doors to the fair chance of a reading.
ABIEs are such delicate subjects, we scarcel
know how to handle them. Some loo
upon a Baby as an unmitigated good, but
we have often met with it in the shape of
a “crying evil.” Much, however, depends
on the treatment of the infant, and in this
respect we cannot too much condemn the
bad example set by the providers of public
entertainments, for a º is seldom intro-
duced upon the stage, except to be stuffed
into a drawer, thrust away under a bed,
sat down upon in a chair, or thrown about
in a tantomime. If all the world were
literally a sage, no baby could survive
the first stage of its existence. A real
Adelphi baby should possess a heart of
bran and a head of wood, the arms of a Dutch doll and the legs of a
Marionette, to be able to bear the treatment to which it is liable.
Happily our business is with the baby of private life, and not with the
baby of the foot-lights, so that we are not doomed to the agony of
tracing its heartrending career, from the hands of its unnatural father
|—the property man—to the hampers, the holes and corners, the parcels,
and even the pockets, into which it is kicked and crammed in the
course of its brief existence.
| A new-born baby exhibits to the eye of a casual observer during the
first few weeks of its existence nothing but a series of grimaces,
which, though usually the result of wind, are supposed to arise from
intelligence. When a baby has a tendency to nocturnal roaring, the
mother usually proposes a mild cathartic, but the father is apt to
propose a more decided regimen by committing it to the nursery.
Some infants scream at the sight of a strange face, a mode of proceed-
|. which is usually attributed to sagacity on the part of the “little
dear,” but it really arises from that cacoethes lacrymandi which is so
|prevalent among the infant community.
| When the child is teething, it is difficult to say what should be the
mode of treatment, but speaking as a father—not as a mother—we are
inclined to think that the only course to take while the infant cuts its
teeth, is for the time to cut the infant.
Among the diseases to which children are liable we must instance
: spasms, which, however, are often an imaginary complaint, put forward
by the nurse as a plea for the necessity of having some spirits always at
hand, and “from hand to mouth” is continually exemplified by the class
alluded to.
As the complaints of the baby are not a pleasant theme, we shall pass
over the catalogue commencing alphabetically in Croup and ending in

appreciate.

taunted at the station with my laziness. They will not believe I take
any exercise with my present substantial appearance. They imagine I
am sitting down somewhere, panting, wiping my forehead, reposing from
the extreme fatigue of walking down half a street. They little know
what a restless being I am. Why, I am never still for two moments—
walking as rapidly as my size will allow me—in the hope of reducing
my fat. Beside", where am I go to ? Every area-gate is locked against
me: every kitchen-door is slammed in my face. My largeness makes
me a conspicuous object... I cannot slink down the area-steps, unper-
ceived, like some thin fellows whom I could mention. The cookies
know I should only compromise them. My movements are necessarily
slow. In the event of a surprise, how could I run with the rapidity of
a black, beetle into the nearest cupboard?, More than this, where
would be the cupboard large enough to hold me? No; I feel I am
shunned by those yery beings whom my heart and Police-station in life
prompt me to hold the dearest in life. Yes, it cannot be denied, I am
the Pariah of the kitchen. However, I have a rich morsel of consola-

THE EMPIRE OF BEADLEDOM.
Sever AL incidents connected with, the recent entry of the Beadle
into the Arcade, have been added to the original accounts from various
sources. We select a few of the principal. - -
When the Beadle was about to salute one of the young girls, his eye
fell suddenly upon one of the old, guard—a very old (black) guard—
whom he instantly decorated with an order—for the Olympic. The
effect was excellent. -
Everywhere the same en'husiasm. The Beadle gave an entertain-
ment at the dining-rooms in Rupert Street. There were three covers—
one of meat and two of potatoes—which had an admirable effect. The
dining-room was decorated in the very richest style, with transparencies
and other emblems. One transparency was of glass, on which some
words were written in gold letters on a black ground, but at the dis-
tance we were at we could not decipher them. The Rheumatic Band
played at the bottom of the staircase during the repast. At its con:
clusion, the Beadle left threepence for the young girl who had offered
im, with her own hands, the viands he had partaken of Ihis
evidently produced the best impression.
In the evening the Beadle visited the Concert Room of the Crown,
and remained to hear the recitation, by the celebrated Miss Rebecca,
of some lines written expressly for the occasion under the title of
LE BEADLEDOM c'Est—The PAY!
It was observed that the Beadle, in drinking the health of the com:
pany, did so in an IMPERIAL measure. The fact was significant, and
the effect was excellent. - - -
Some difference of opinion is said to exist as to the title by which
the Beadledom is to be made hereditary. It has been stated that the
style intended to be assumed will be that of BUMBLE II., Beadle of the
Aicade, and “Protector of the Lowther Bazaar,” but as this would
imply a disposition to an extension of territory, it has been objected to
as #. unnecessary provocation to foreign powers. It is true that
little resistance could be anticipated from Exeter, whose tenantry
setm to have resigned in a body, and to have vacated their offices.
The Beadle of Exeter is thus thrown upon his own resources, which
consisted, when we saw him last, of a pennyworth of walnuts.

A VISION OF CONVOCATION.
THE Times I had lately been reading,
And had fall'n asleep o'er the ãº.
*T was the same which announced a proceeding
To turn each gobemouche to a gaper—
How Lord DERby, the church bent on weed-
1ng
Though at cos" of a little seceding,
Had de'ermined (all dangers unheeding)
By revived Convocation to shape ber.
How I slept on such news was a wonder—
I suppose’t was from sheer stupefaction—
But I dreamed that I heard a far thunder
Which drove me well nigh to distraction.
Where it came from, above me, or under,
I knew not, but towards it did blunder,
Till the darkness around broke a under,
And revealed Convocation in action.
Its scene was a something between a
Pit for ratting, or cock or dog-fighting,
And the statelier sort of arena
Which Tauromachous Spaintakes delight in.
But for Senor and fair Senorina,
With mantilla, and fan, and basquina,
Collected around might be seen a
Kind of audience much less inviting.
There were curates, perpetual and other,
For the most part by no means plethoric,
And rectors who, squeezed in the smother,
Gave off large amounts of caloric:
There were bishops, of much pomp and pother,
Who addressed each his colleague as “brother,”
But looked at the same time “quite t'other,”
And capitular bodies Historic:
There were prim and precise Oxford fellows,
Giv'n to bowings and strange intonation,
Their rubicunds all turned to yellows,
With fasting and mortification:
There were Pºli preachers, most zealous,
With power of (what boxers call) “bellows.”
Which might make a street-mountebank
jealous—
Gospel-Gongs for a deaf generation.
On the pit all their gazes were centered,
Where arrayed—in condition as prime,
As was ever bull-terrier entered,
To kill threescore rats against time—
I beheld the Church champions who ventured
Their lungs for the business be-Stentored,
And hammer and tongs at it went hard—
As I'll try to record in my rhyme,
There was PHILLPOTTs pretending to ſrolic,
But meeting his match quite in GoRHAM;
And WILBERFoRCE, pleading a cholic, .
Lest he might be asked to fight for him:
While HUxTABLE, less apostolic
In his view of the Church than bucolic,
Preached up fertilizers coprolic,
And bowled down Dean Cockburn before him.
DR. Pusey, begowned and betrenchered,
Went in with a will against HAMPDEN ;
DR. THORPE fought a hundred who censured
Th' Ecclesiologic, “late CAMDEN,”
Bishop Bloom FIELD 'gainst BENNETT did
wrench hard,
With RochestER WHISTON did clench hard,
(More fools they that to tackle him ventured,)
'Till a tangle of law they got jammed in.
MR. DENNIsoN hit out for High Church;
MR. Close countered fiercely for Low
Church;
MR. GLADston E roared “Here goes for my
Church;”
GILBERT ELLIOT fought s!outly for no
Church:
Till Arminian Church—High and dry Church—
Oxford-mixture or Casuistry Church—
Our, your, his and their, my and thy Church—
Composed quite a joint-stock or Co-Church.
In the midst of this burly and brattle,
Its ruler, Lord DERBY, was seen,
Like a war-horse that sniffe'h the battle,
Yet all unperturbed and serene;
So, at Smithfield, amidst the fierce rattle
Of ºf sticks and terrified cattle,
Stands the Drover, who knows he has that’ll
Appease all the row of the scene:
For from my lord’s pockets are peeping
That best of all sedative dishes,
These gentry in order for keeping,
When to keep them in order his wish is.

Rods in pickle polemic a-steeping,
He has that will set all of them sleeping—
For ’tis he has the loaves and the fishes |
WHO WANTS A SECRET P
HF two peasant children,
who were visited by the
WIRGIN MARY, near Gre-
noble, were each told a
secret which they were par.
ticularly enjoined not to tell
anybody. We will be bound
that these secrets will be
hawked about
France beforelong,
and exhibited, like
wax dolls or white
mice. or any other
perambulating ra-
ree show, for so
much a head—
with this wise ex-
ception, that they
will be exhibited
only to the “faith-
ful.” The money
of no “heretic”
3 will be taken. It
is evident by these
- two secrets being
= still left undi-
: vulged, that the
=" miracle, miracu-
lous, as it has
hitherto been, is still incomplete. Some greater, miracle has yet to
come. Perhaps the secrets will be communicated in a dream to Louis
NAPOLEoN the evening before his coronation; and perhaps, by a miracle
not less miraculous, a large sum of money will be found under the
pillows of the two children when they wake up the following morning.
Or perhaps—for it is absurd to suppose that these secrets were ºver
intended by the clergy to remain secrets—the two children will be
summoned to Nôtre Dame, and there, just previous to the holy oil being
dropped upon the head of the new Emperor, they will divulge to the
astonished congregation what the two secrets are. If this grand
theatrical effect is lost, Louis NAPoleon is not the clever manager we
have generally supposed him to be. But so great a chance will not be
thrown away. We do not pretend to miracles curselves; but we think
we can already tell what these two secrets are.
The First Secret is—that Louis NAPOLEoN will be the greatest
Emperor that ever ruled in the world !
The Second Secret is—that England, before two years are over, will
be a province of Francel
And these are, indeed, Secrets worth knowing ! and the great beauty
about them is, that as far as History is concerned, they will always
remain Secrets,
ATTESTATION OF BEER.
OUR friends, the º: of Bitter Ale, must allow us to remark,
that deep as may be their cleverness in the craft of advertising, ab-
stractedly considered, they evince a flatness, like that of the stalest
swipes, in the puffing art as it concerns their special commodity. . Will
they submit to be taught how, in one point at least, more judiciously
to improve the opportunity which has been afforded, them by what
their scientific correspondent, BARON Liebig, calls "the unguarded
remark of a French Chemist.” They commence one of their encomiums
on their modication of malt liquor by citing—
“The unanimous opinion of the most eminent scientific and medical men of the day,
of BARon Likbia, Messrs. GRAHAM, Hoffni ANN, Muspratt, WATson, Budd,
MARsh ALL HALL, TRAvers, Fenguson, Row E, ViviaN, H Eyg ATF, LEMAN, ARNoLD,
Evans, FoRMBy, PETRIE, MacRorir, Vosy, TUFNELL, HUNTER, DAVIES, Joxes,
SENIoE, MAcLAREN, MacAULAY, GRAY, TEEvax, HILL, HAY wand, HARRison,
PEPPER, INMAN, SIR CHARLEs CLARKE, the SANATony CommissionER of the Lancet,
&c., &c., &c.”
These are not the authorities to quote in behalf of any sort of beer!
What does BARon LIEBIG know about beer? asks the British public
of the British publican. No; if you want to commend your ale to
the popular taste, tell them how it has been honoured with the appro-
bation of really good judges of the beverage. Inform them of the
favour which it has found with the most eminent agricultural and
bucolic men of the day, FARMERs BURLEY, and BROADSIDEs, and
BULLMAN, and Messieurs RUNT, Sturdy, and DRover. Proclaim that
JUGGINs, landlord of the Ram and Wheatsheaf, declares it to be the
liquor most called for; and that it is the drain in principal request
at every cabstand.
Nothing like Crystal.
THE Edinburgh Review, in its own playful manner—for it can be
gamesome as a Highland pony—proposes that, as the people ask for
the ballot, the ballot should be duly awarded them, the ballot-box being
covered with a “glass lid.” Why not P And adopting the old, old
notion of MoMUs, when we have the ballot-box with the glass lid, we

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE “BLUE PIG" TO MR. PUNCH.
R. PUNch,--I am the owner
and proprietor of the Blue
Pig Tea-gardens, a sweet
resort—though I say it—
for the feast of soul and
flowers of reason. And I
thank you, Mr. Punch,
as a man, a father, a
Christian, and particularly
as the landlord of the Blue
Pig Gardens, for your
lovely article in your last
but one about the dese-
cration—for that, I hear
on all hands, from fifty
licensed victuallers at
least, is the word—the
desecration of the Sab-
bath by the opening after
morning service of the
Crystal Palace at Syden-
ham to an unreflecting
British public. Mr. Punch,
l'm not a man as cries
out upon a little. But I
do consider the British
Sabbath as one of the
brightest jewels in HER
Majesty's Crown ; and
once open that Palace on
a Sunday—and what do
you think will become of
Windsor Castle P Not
only of Windsor Castle
—but of Lambeth Palace
and the whole monarchy?
W: Sir, the whole thing
—which is now the envy
of surrounding nations—
will bust, Sir; yes, bust like a soap-bubble, and leave not a Rex behind.
“What, I ask, when the crimson waves of revolution—as I heard the ReverEND MR.
JABEz CRANK all of a foam and perspiration say—the crimson waves of revolution was washing
our thrones, and carrying away, as if they was no more than so many drowned puppies,
crowns, and sceptres—what saved the British Throne, the Queen, the PRINCE, and the rest
of the Royal Family from the deluge? Why, the British Sabbath—with its Sunday Tea-
rdens all round smoky London, like—as MR. CRANK says—“like a squat Injun with his
elts of beads !”
“Don’t think—for I’m quite above it—don't think I want to puff the Blue Pig. It isn't
necessary, Sir. No, the excellence of its liquors (no British brandy, but the real Coneyhatch)
—no doctored gin, but the mantlin Cream of the Walley (I have heard it called Dove's Milk)—
no rum which isn't rum at all, but the pure Jamaicay from the cane—nothing 'dulterate, but
all pure spirits has º the Blue É. on a pinnacle that puts it far beyond a puff. 'It's
no matter how drunk I get on a Sunday at the Blue Pig’—is at times the boast of all my
customers—'no matter how drunk, the liquors is so good, that if I'm a beast on the Sunday
night, I’m as fresh, as a daisy on the Monday morning !'. I do assure, you, Mr. Punch,
I’ve known men who, use the Blue Pig take their ten, twelve, fourteen glasses of gin-and-
water,, and—a little skrimmage with their wives or companions going for nothing, for
such, things will happen—and afterwards, go home quiet as new-born babies; rising
on the Monday like giants refreshed. But then, as I say, the Blue Pig's liquors is
notorious.
“What, then, I ask, do we want with new-fangled Palaces, where 'dolatory—as MR.
CRANK *...* be taught on Sunday, when we have our own national Tea-gardens, like
the Blue Pig, with liquors served up to twelve at night in beautiful little bowers of privet
and sweet-briar with—at the proper season—hollyhocks, all as fine as if it was their Sunday
out * Isn't this a place for the working-man to bring his wife and children to, and whilst he
takes his humble gin-and-water, and whiffs his bird's-eye, to sit and watch the smoke, and
think (as MR. GRANK says) what vanity is life, and what wapours is all of us?
“Whereas, pictur to yourself that man with wife and children in that Sunday Wickedness—
(a Babylon framed and glazed, MR. JAbez CRANK calls it!)—the Crystal Palace. What can
he think, on there that shan't make him forget he's a true-born Englishman? What will he
see but abominations and 'dolatries? Not only that, but think of the man's health. Why,
there's to be water enough in fountains to drown London. ... Now, is it º that—as
MR, CRANK says-in our wariable climate, a man, and his wife, and tender children, (some
of 'em perhaps at the breast) can walk among so much water without º: cold P I
consider them fountains, Sir, as so much disease—yes, so much decline and consumption—
laid on at high service for the Sunday visitors of the Crystal Palace. Now, there is nothing
of this sort at the Blue Pig. Water there is and plenty; and water used with moderation
cannot be objected against with a healthy quantity of spirits: 'specially such spirits as the
Blue Pig's. ...And then, to hear the Crystal #. heathens make a brag that they won't sell
spirits at all. What a joke, when there's thousands of public-houses open on Sundays,
where the hippopotamus if it liked might swim in liquor.
But the fountains isn't the only danger: that—as MR. CRANK says—is only a matter of
the body; but what I'm now coming to is an affair of the soul. It’s an alarming fact that
E.
Pi—
Ele
E--
E---
- E-
—as I've read—there's to be fifty millions of
scarlet geraniums in the grounds. You are
quite right, Mr. Punch, and have hit the very
nail upon the head with that hammer which you
use for a pen-quite º when you say that
these geraniums must make the Sunday English-
man think of the Scarlet Unfortuna'e Female
at Rome. Yes; the Englishman, instead of
being in the aſternoon at church—coming as
early as he can to the Blue Pig, but then we
don't close our Gardens till twelve—instead of
being in his family pew, if he can pay for it,
..". wandering like a savage and a heathen
in a Temple erected—MR. CRANK says as much
—to Atheism with a future eye to a Republic.
Now, Sir, here's two picturs I want you to look
at. The Englishman, with his wife and children
about his knees—some on 'em picking their
virtuous º: or eating their modest peri-
winkles—the Englishman taking, his glasses, of
i. or rum-and-water, and quietly smoking his
czen pipes, thinking quietly of his past life in
the bosom of his family, and of his future end.
Consider that Englishman, Sir, resting himself
in the Blue Pig Tea-gardens aſter the labours of
the week, and tell me if he isn't one of the
proudest institutions of the country With
that Englishman we've unfurled the flag of
battle : with that Englishman we won Waterloo
—and with that Englishman—defended, as MR.
CRANK says, from the Yewplush Tree of the
foreigner —we may still defy the world.
Now, Mr. Punch, just look at pictur, No. 2.
Consider that Englishman, with wife and children,
wandering about the Crystal Wilderness. Allow-
ing they don't get cold from the fountains—
what do they see about 'em P Why, nothing
to fix their Sabbath thoughts. The Blue ºf
Tea-gardens keep a man, so to say it, to himself,
his bird’s-eye, and his gin-and-water: but the
Crystal Palace will be a Tower of Babel in glass;
and I only hope—with Mr. JABez CRANK–
that all concerned in it may be scattered to all
the ends of the earth, like the first builders. I
should be happy, Mr. Punch—and would give
legs-of-mutton and trimmings, with beer and
spirits besides—if I could only once know that
that Paxton was on the Coast of Guinea, and
Fox and HENDERson, one in the Red Sea and
t’other in the Black. For them men—if the
wickedness of the Sunday Palace is allowed—
them men will be the ruin of all Sunday Tea-
[. and not a farthing of 'demnity. For I
ook upon the Sunday Crystal Palace as nothing
more than a Monster Extinguisher in Glass, that
will put out, yes, a thousand Gin Palaces. The
ruin them men will bring on Sunday bars, and
Sunday gardens, I wouldn't have on my head
for the Bank of England! But let me conclude
the pictur of Englishman No. 2. Think of it,
with rocks about him, brought from all ends of
the world—with undressed statues—with palaces
of the heathen gods and goddesses—and skeletons
of monsters that lived before the world was pro-
perly finished for Christians to come to. Think
of the state of that man's mind—all of a whirl,
a worry, and confusion: d ed here by one
jº there by another—and wherever
he's dragged, still dragged from church
“How different, Sir, the happy Englishman
behind his *; in the $º ea-gardens, and
the doomed Briton lost in the Crystal Palace.
Couldn't you, Mr. Punch, give picturs of 'em,
and so aid the cause of morality and loyalty,
which is the only thing that has stirred me up
to write; and now am, yours,
“THE BLUE PIG.”
“P.S. If the Crystal Palace is open on
Sunday, all Sunday Tea-Gardens and all Gin-
Palaces must and shall be 'demnified.—B. P.”

THE EMPIRE OF BEADLEDOM.
N - tº-
~) &Dºº - N
The title under which the Beadledom is to be assumed is now the
subject of general conversation. Some are of opinion that Bumble
II. is scarcely extensive enough to take in all the souvenirs that ought to
be comprehended, and it is desirable that the take in should be as
complete as possible. They go the length of proposing that Bumble
§§ should be the title of the new Beadle, as the generations of
Beadledom date very far back, and, though there was no recognition of
the intermediate BüMBLEs, it is said with much reason tha', as they
were not known, they could not be recognised.
The following address has been agreed to by one of the Courts—a
very inferior Court—in the neighbourhood:-
“Highness. Universal acclamations have accompanied your journey
through the Arcade, and turned it into a triumphal, march. The
Arcade has spoken through her wind instruments, in her cups, and
everywhere. She desires for the Chief of the Arcade a title which shall
unite all her glories, including her cocked hat, so dear to her heart, her
staff on which she has relied, and her gold lace, with which she desires
you in her name to lace her jacket. In the words of your immortal
uncle, we presume to say to you that six ranges of tea-caddies and
work boxes look down upon you from these gim-crack pyramids. Deign
then, Highness, to give º to that which has been shaken, and
give force to that which has been hitherto too fragile.”
It is expected that his Highness will declare himself moved, by, the
force of these powerful arguments, to accept the Hereditary Beadledom.
Some changes in the constitution of the Arcade are beginning to be
talked about. The portrait of the Beadle will, it is said, adorn the
centre of the Arcade. It is to be surrounded with precious stones,
that is to say, with precious large paving-stones.
The Beadle continues to receive the most º marks of adhe-
sion from the market-women, some of whom stick to him with pressing
pertinacity. He has lately received a deputation from the female
º: one of whom threw bunches of (ever) greens in his
path; while the melody of “My Light Savoy,” was played as a duet
between two members of the Green Baize and the Rheumatic bands,
on the Pandean pipes and cymbals.
Auri Sacra Fames.
Such is the thirst for gold in Australia that the real wealth of the
colony is being neglected, and there is little chance of the crop of wool
being secured, unless the sheep should assume an auriferous character,
and yield a golden fleece.
“MR. Punch,-Which did Louis NApoleon say, ‘I’Empire_c'est
la pair, or “L’Empire c’est l'épée fº Yours, G.”
SHEEP IN RAILWAY TRAINS.
WHAT a wonderful improvement has taken place in the tempºr of
the British Public!, To such a proficiency have they attained in the
virtue of patience, that they will now not only put up with any injustic:
or imposition, but submit to be treated with the greatest contempt and
insolence into the bargain. They are content to travel in railway pens,
like sheep to the slaughter, injured, deluded, derided, and only bleating
in return.
“Straher,” a passenger, on a recent day, by the North-Western
mail train, which arrived at the Euston Square terminus three hours
behind time, writing in the Times, says,
“And, certainly, when any of the passengers during the journey had the temerity to
put his head out of a window, and inquire of any of the numerous officials on the plat-
Iorms at the places of detention the cause of so many prolonged stoppages, he was
lucky if he escaped no worse treatment than a horse laugh in reply.”
In the same Times, “A TRAvelue R BY THE GREAT WestERN"
complains that he did not get to 9xford till, thirty-five minutes after
time. “Another Victim of Monopoly" also complains, that he
arrived at the same place by the 4.50 express train nearly half-an-hour
late—pursued by a second express at risk to life and limb. And the
Rºy. Thomas Delves BRoughton, relates the particulars of a
collision occurring at the Bletchley station, in consequence of mis-
management, and resulting in severe injury to a lady's arm, and in
bruises, lost teeth, and cut heads, on the part of other passngers.
Railway accidents, railway frauds, railway impertinence, are the staple
of our daily newspaper-reading. Railway chairmen and directors are
descending to the knavery, extortion, impudence, and brutality, from
which cabmen are rising in the scale of manners and morals. And, as
aforesaid, the British Public stands all this with passive mournfulness,
quiet endurance, meek, inactive expostulation.
Has it not grown to be a temperate public, a nice, gentle, long-
suffering public? Ah! there was a time, very considerably within the
memory of man, when this public, so tame now, cºuld not be put upon
at so little expense. If merely swindled by a playhouse manager, it
would deface ornaments and tear up benches. What would have
happened, in those days, if free-born British passengers had been
systematically delayed, endangered, and moreover mocked and set at
nought, by rds of unscrupulous, avaricious, dividend-grasping,
screwing, bloated railway directors? But now, as the public no longer
takes the law into its own hands, and does mischief, it ought to insist
upon legal damages in the event of accident or stoppage.
POETRY OF FINANCE.

Unless you arrest this fast depopulation.

Prince's Mixture.
Madame Tussaud's advertisements contain the following curious
combination of attractions:-
* The chamber of Horrors and the Napoleon Chamber, 6d. extra."
This mixture is highly complimentary to the name, of Napoleon-
though, if the Napoleon Chamber is devoted to the deeds of Pºisºr.
Louis Napoleon, giving all the horrors that were perpetrated in the
days of December, the association is easily accounted for-only it
strikes us that one Chamber would have sufficed for the two at present.
RAILWAY TRAVELLING MADE EASY.

there was “a train of seven bridesmaids.” Now, when we travel on

ENTARY FEAT.
It is becoming a common and rather a vulgar
feat to walk a thousand miles in a thousand
hours. Some suburban Chicken, Stag, or Pet
is now doing something in the same way at
the Hippodrome, but we have to call atten-
tion to a far more difficult achievement, in
which sitting instead of walking is the mode
in which the task is accomplished.
The hero of the feat
in question is Charley
Shaw LEFevre, well
known as the Parlia-
mentary Pet, or House
of Commons Game-
Cock, who has already
— according to Sir
Robert Inglis—per-
formed the astonishing
task of listening to thir-
teen thousand speeches
in thirteen thousand
hours. The Right Hon-
ourable bird – if the
Cock of the Commons
will allow us to call him
so – has just entered
upon another match, in
which he undertakes to
sit for another series of
hours during another
- series of speeches; and
there will be constant relays of gentlemen of the press in attendance to report, should the
distinguished Pet allow himself to fall from the mouth of Spooner, or of any one else, into
the arms of Mohpheus,
We shall watch the progress of the match with considerable interest, for in addition to the
large body of old-established soporifics, who have on other occasions been found so trying to
the vigilant powers of the Cock of the Commons, there is, supposed, to be a very, con;
º extrainfusion of poppies, occasioned by the “new additions” to the raw material
of Parliament.

THE CRYSTAL PALACE—“ WITHOUT THE DRAGON | *
In one of the many admirable articles that have appeared about the Crystal Palace in the
Times—being to the Crystal Palace a º and support, beyond the power of iron-the
writer rejoices that SIR. Joseph Paxton will doeyerything “that a knight can to bring down
tº the 19th century, and within a few minutes' drive of London, the fabled gardens of the
Hesperides, without the dragon.”. We hope so; but we are nevertheless threatened with the
monster, at least one day a week—and that the only day wherein the Hesperides may be
visitable by millions—the Sunday. The dragon CANT—all his scales covered with the
glossiest black, his armed neck decºrously bound with snowy cambric—his head, horrent with
spikes, surmounted by a beaver of shovel-shape;—this Dragon has given voice; modulating
his roarings, and—as is the wont of Draco Cast—doing his best to disguise his domination
in zeal and love and tenderness towards his sufferers. Well, how shall the Dragon be met
After this fashion. "
The Dragon must be met and answered by the working-men of London. They must
gather together—they must sign acres of parchment—they must beset the House of Commons,
iſ they will not give themselves up with their wives and children to the Dragon. If they
will not have the whole of their Sunday swallowed, bolted by the Dragon, they must at
orce defy him. The Dragon says, You shall keep to your back-rooms, your garrets, your
courts, all the Sabbath hours that you come not to church. You shall not smell the flowers
at Sydenham on Sunday; for on that day are they flowers of brimstone; you shall not on the
seventh day enter that Garden of Eden for there lurks the old serpent. You shall not gaze
upon orange trees in bud, blossom, and fruit
for every orange is as the death-dooming apple
is not tobacco by the fireside more healthful fo
your soul than sight of tobacco-plant flowering
under glass?
Doctor Caoly has been sweetly eloquent on
“the domestic meal” on Sunday evenings.
Labouring men want the repose of their own
close rooms, and not the azitation of sight-seeing;
all this is vanity, saith the preacher. But the
Doctor waxes old; he was not always thus
morose. Now there are persons who denounce
profane stage-plays as so many snares of the
Evil One; denounce them, even as Doctor
cRoly denounces the garden Sabbath. And yet
in their eyes must Doctor Crony be little hºtter
than one of the wicked. For is not the Doctor
author of a play called Catiline (watered with
the Liffy and not quite Jonson's Catiline); and
also a comedy, so broad that it ran into furious
farce, by name Pride shall hare a Fall? And
did not Doctor CRoly, in this farce, not having
the fear of the Horse Guards before his eyes,
did he not endeavour to bring “the Tenth”
into contempt; and that, too, at that very critical
time when the Tenth proclaimed the amazing
fact in Brighton ball-room that “the Tenth
didn't dance?” And now, has farce-writing,
joke-cracking, rollicking Choly become an an-
chorite, and, we doubt not, wears iron points
and horse-hair.
But is there no way to mollify our CRoly
Can we not touch his heart, even through his
pocket? Let us see.
A sagacious correspondent of the Morning
Herald suggests that a certain space of the
Crystal Palace
* Might be set apart and fitted up as a place of worship.
in which all or mºst of the sittings should be free. I
would propose three services, the morning service to com-
mence at half-past ten or eleven amº, the mid-day at three
p.m. in the summer. The grounds around the palace might,
perhaps with advantage, be thrown open from the conclu-
sion of the morning to the commencement of the evening
service.”
This is admirable, and meets the whole diffi:
culty. Let there be º: to the Crystal
Palace a Crystal Cathedral; and let there, be
created a new Bishop of Glass, with some ten
thousand pounds º annum; together with
prebends and all the ecclesiastical ºfficers that
adorn and dignify the cathedrals of York and
Canterbury. "Let this be done, and all the
Reverend gentlemen meeting at Siºn House
have all fat appointments. The Venerable Anch-
peacon Halºmust, of course, be the first Bishop
of Glass; for the pregnant reason, that no
man's motives, in his present opposition, can be
more clearly seen through.

BRIEFLess complains that there is bitter irony

there will be no procedure, or getting on, for the
profession under it.

RAILWAY “POINTs.”
W ERY
many of the accidents that
are now daily occurring
arise, we are told, from in-
attention to the “Points.”
We are not well versed in
jº phraseology, and
have but a misty notion
of what the “Points” in
question really are. But
they have long been knotty
ones to us, and we are
therefore tempted to adopt
the Gordian process, and
summarily cut the problem
that we cannot solve. On
any given railway, then,
we fearlessly will under-
take to find,-
1. A “Point” of regu-
lating the traffic almost
entirely by the laws of
eccentric motion: starting
the trains º at
any time—that stated in
the time-bills alone sys-
tematically excepted.
2. A “Point” of proving
that “delays are danger-
ous,” by studiously de-
taining the (so-called)
“regular” trains, until they
are comfortably run into by irregular (and better paying) “excursions.”
3. A “Point” of starting fast trains immediately upon the wheels of
slow; so that a pleasant little excitement is sustained in both, and the
chances of a collision are reduced pretty nearly to a dead certainty.
4. A “Point” of selecting for a “trial trip” that period of the day
when the line is fullest; and of then dashing off without a minute's
notice, and at what proves, generally, a killing pace. -
5. A “Point” of penny-wisely “reducing the expenditure,” by the
popular expedient of amalgamating, in the person of one unhappy
signal-man, the ubiquitous duties of a dozen other posts. (N.B. And
when an accident does happen, of course it is found to have been caused
simply by “neglect of du y,” and nobody ever thinks of blaming the
immaculate Directors for it.)
These, we are sure, are “Points” in every Railway Charter; and we
fear there will be no end to the chapter of accidents so long as they are

A LEGAL LAMENT,
(FOR THE MORROW OF ALL SOULS).
By a Q.C. of long standing.
'Tis the first day of Term, and the Lawyers awaken;
Damp wigs have been aired, dusty gowns have been shaken;
The Briefs that have slept Long Vacation through
By refreshers' aid have been conned anew ;
And from roof to wall of Westminster Hall
The echoes stir 'neath their cobweb pall;
And the barristers' clerks are all on the tout,
And blue-bagged attorneys are trotting about;
And counsel are clustering, and judges are mustering;
And clients are flustering, and ushers are blustering;
And Juniors with motions for front seats are hustling;
And Leaders in big wigs and silk are a-rustling;
Who would not be sucked down had better withdraw—
For agape again is the maw of the Lawl
But under silk and bombazine what heavy hearts are there!
How many a wig, both bob and big, covers a load of care!
O'er great and small, since in that Hail we met for business last,
The Common Law Procedure Bill, like a simoom, hath past—
To clip the wings of bills of costs, to quicken law's delay,
Sweep of half-guinea motions, and cut rules to plead away;
Special Demurrers to destroy, and with a º blow,
o massacre our ancient friends, John DoE and Richard Roe
Oh! pleasant fictions of the Law, black-letter forms august–
What availed your sacred cobwebs—your venerable rust?.
Your cunning knots shall bind no more; no more your quibbles rare
Shall show into how many parts pleaders can split a hair:
E'en in the shadow of the Bench, Justice shall beard Chicane,
And Form, in Form's old stronghold, shall 'gainst Merits plead in vain;
Till here, as in the County Courts, law, in her own defence,
Shali sink from her high calling to the depths of Common Sense!
ELECTRICITY PERVERTED.
THE Electric Telegraph—commu-

tre of Paris—was
for the first time
worked on the 1st
instant. The ex-
periments Were
complete: the do-
minated lightning
did its errands
with electric truth.
But, why—we ask
it—why send the
lightning upon a
shabby message,
making of it for
the time a syco-
phant to the arch
traitor, Louis NA-
Poleon; the man who has “restored society” by raining bullet: upºn
French hearths? Here is the message: and the lightning-like the
accusing angel—must have blushed its reddest as it gave it in:
“The Directors of the Submarine Telegraph Company beg leave to approach his
Highness the prince President with the expression of their best thanks for the
assistance which he has uniformly given towards the establishment of this instanța:
neous means of communication between France and Great Britain. May this wºul
invention serve, under the Empire, to promote the peace and prosperity of the world!
“Under the Empire!” Well, it is all right... “The directors of the
Submarine Telegraph Company” have acknowledged the Empire; so
the President may fling away his cocked hat, and don his crown as soon
as he lists. Following the example set by the Telegraph folks, English
sausage-makers, and manufacturers of British Champagne have also
resolved to send in their adhesion to “the Empire.”
And so John Bull sends messages by lightning to the ºr. of
France 1 Well, let us hope his double dealing may never compelus to
follow the lightning of Cornhill with the thunder of three-deckers.
A Sail and a Sell.
It is a very lamentable fact that whenever a Government screw
steamer gets out to sea, there is almost always ascrew loose. It cannot
be said that the builders play the game of fast and loose, for however
loose the screw, the steamer is generally anything but fast.

DERBY AND DIZZY AT ASTLEY'S,
HAVE any of our readers yet beheld the PRIME MINIsTER and the
CHANCELLOR or THE Exchequer in the arena at Astley's If not, let
them lose no time, but go and see the sight. These eminent statesmen
act a wonderful feat called La Perche; although they appear under the
assumed titles of the BRothers SIEGFRIED and speak broken English,
as if they were Germans.
La Perche is an extraordinary exhibition; and perhaps it was never
given to any two men save to DERby and to Disraeli to go through with
it. Imagine DERby holding perpendicularly a long tapering pole o
some eighteen or twenty feet. This pole he supports in a loop of some
sort in his waistband. The pole is a smooth pole without cut or notch.
DISRAELI, chalking his shoes—(what would become of the Exchequer
without the use of chalk?)-lays hold upon the pole, and by the adroit
use of his hands and feet alone, climbs to the very top-DERBy
...; a little, it must be owned, under the weight. But yet this
is notning.
When DIs RAELI has arrived at the top of the pole, what marvellous
tricks he acts | He lies down, his stomach on the top of the pole, and
whilst thus, goes round and round even as weathercock turns with the
wind. . He then, one hand holding the pole and the sole of one foot
planted flat at the side of it, stands out from the pole.
Next DISRAELI makes himself like unto a snake, and turns round
and round the pole; and great, indeed, is the applause that attends
these sinuosities, that, of course, attract nearly all the attention to
DisRAELI-poor Drºy, who has to bear the pole and with it to bear
!º tricks of BENJAMIN, perspiring, all but unnoticed, under his
Oaſi.
We advise everybody to witness the exhibition as soon as they
may; for bets are offered that DisBAELI will not be able to keep it up
many nights, and DERBY has been heard to declare his own condition
to be very ticklish.

THE BAR AND ITS PROSPECTS.
WE understand that, acting upon suggestions thrown out from i.
legal quarters that local bars should be formed, it is contemplated by
R. #: to endeavour to restore the ancient Court of pie poudre,
which is an old court for the settlement of disputes arising at a fair or
public market. Clare Market has been spoken of as the spot on which the
new experiment may be tried, and a meeting has already taken place-
accidentally—between MR. BRIEFLess and MR. DuNUP on the subject
alluded to. The object of the learned gentlemen is supposed to be the
}. bar at the spot in question. As there must be
accommodation for robing, however small the attendance of counsel
may be, it is expected that the proprietor of one of the largest wine-
vaults will be requested to set apart a private portion of his bar, for
the convenience of the bar attending the sittings, or rather the standings
of the pie poudre Court.

so formidable at one time that the safety of the vessel was doubtful,
and it was necessary to keep all the pumps at work. We beg leave to
offer as a suggestion, that all Government ships should on their first
voyage be compelled to carry a Lord of the Admiralty, as then-in the
event of leakage–there will be at least one powerful Pump on board.

HYMEN v. PLUTUs;
OR, THE CURE FOR DEPOPULATION.
º HAT measures to take in, conse-
H. quence of the rapid and alarmin
- decrease of our population, whic
is running all away to the Diggings,
is, clearly, the great question now
coming on. This the Ministers, it
is to be feared, are not prepared to
answer; doubtless they have been
too much occupied in devising
what to say for themselves in
backing out of Protection, for that,
Should they, eventually, come for-
ward with any scheme for the main-
tenance of our native stock, it will
probably consist in the imposition
of a fixed duty upon foreign
imports.
In the meanwhile, various inde-
pendent members will be ad-
vancing, to meet the difficulty,
plans of their own, more or less to
the purpose: less, perhaps, rather
than more. One will be for in-
creasing the tobacco duty; another,
the taxes on knowledge; another
will propose a Sunday bill; an-
other, that every chimney shall
consume its own smoke; another,
fancying himself a practical man,
will suggest the entire prohibition
of medical treatment.
Anything rather than the remedy which is straightforward and
obvious—because that remedy would be a pleasant one: and your
legislators will go any round-about way to avoid a plain and direct
course that is also agreeable. -
The obvious and straightforward remedy is the encouragement of
matrimony. Statistics amply demonstrate, the ratio between the
number of births and that of marriages, which, indeed, forms the basis
º: #: Mºravis theory, on the converse whereof you will now have
0 legislate.
Let there, then, be passed an Act of Parliament for the Promotion
of Wedlock. Have it couched, if possible, in grammatical terms: in
plain English; so that the single man who runs may read, and halt,
and stay at home, and become the father of a happy family
By the provisions of this enactment,
A double Income Tax shall be imposed upon all Bachelors of more
than twenty-five years of age. Four years of discretion ought certainly
to be allowed for such an important matter as, the choice of a wife.
Bachelors of above sixty shall not be allowed to evade this tax º
marrying, as many of them would do who have remained single, all
their lives simply to shirk the expense of a wife. No Bachelor shall
be suffered to defeat the intention of the Act by marrying a lady of
more than thirty: if any so old a lady exists... . -
A bonus, out of the taxes levied under this Act, shall be paid to
every widower who re-marries. It would be too much to require any
man who has once been married to marry again, because he has, most
probably, one of two opposite but equally good, reasons for reuſaining
single: and cannot be reasonably expected to take another wife, except
for a pecuniary consideration. -
Damages shall not be recoverable for “Breach of Promise,” but the
contract, without good cause shown to the contrary, shall be enforced
under penalty of imprisonment for contempt; unless, indeed, defendant
shall have become the bridegroom of another than plaintiff; in which
case said damages shall be paid into court, and reserved as portion for
plaintiff on her marriage: but in the event of her passing the above-
mentioned age of thirty unmarried, shall be handed over to her next of
female kin, marrying under that age. - -
Marriage Settlements shall be done, away with ; since there are
numerous fine young men who would gladly marry any nice girl with
lots of money—if they were only sure they could get at it.
All import and ... duties, dues, and customs, shall be entirely re-
mitted and taken off from all and sundry silks, satins, velvets, brocades,
muslins, sarcenets, laces, ginghams, merinoes, furs, tippets, bonnets,
shawls, French shoes and gloves, scents, perfumes, pomades, dentrifices,
jewels, brooches, pearls, owches, precious stones, and trinkets: from
these and every #: whatsoever stuffs, apparel, cosmetics, ornaments,
decorations, and all manner of things and matters serving and con-
ducive to the beautifying, embellishment, and dulcification of the
ſeminine person: with a view to the total and complete removal of
the burdens on attractive industry tending to procure husbands.
Casinos and dancing academies shall be all prohibited, in order that
young men, if they wish to dance, may be forced to go and dance in
respectable society: where there is a probability of their being intro-
duced to partners for life.
ºlor. shall be instituted under the direction of the Home
ce.
Caudle clubs shall be established throughout the country—subsidized
by Government. N.B., Coffin ditto shall be put down.
Schools shall be provided to adorn young ladies who may be deficient
in beauty with the charm of mind, the demand whereof, unsupplied,
keeps more men single than may be generally supposed.
In the above sketch of a Matrimonial Encouragement Act, it has
not been proposed to inflict any penalty for celibacy on ladies, Respect
for the Rights of Women requires that they should always be allowed
the freedom to refuse an offer: a liberty which it may confidently be
hoped they will never abuse.
A TOMB FOR HOOD.
GIVE HOOD a tombstone;—’tis not much to give
To one who s'irr'd so oft our smiles and tears;
But why a tomb to him whose lines will live,
His noblest monument, to after years?
To which I answer, that in times to come—
Times of more equal lots and gentler laws—
The workers may not seek, in vain, his tomb
Who pleaded, once, so movingly their cause.
If marble mark the soldier's, statesman's grave,
If monuments adorn his place of sleep
Whose hand struck off the fetters from the slave,
And his who sought out woe in dungeon's deep,
Did he not fight for Toil's sad sons and daughters ?
Was not his voice loud for the worker's right P
Was he not potent to arrest the slaughters
Of Capital and Labour's desperate fight P
Oh! mothers, think of his melodious pity
Over the victim of the Bridge of Sighs—
Oh! Almoners of the o'er-crowded city,
Think of the shirt-maker's heart-piercing cries
You, too, whose lighter hearts turned from such themes,
Who sought his page for smiles and not for tears,
Think of his wit, how pure and bright its gleams,
Mocking the sadness of his later years:
And say, if Hood should moulder into dust
Without a stone to mark his place of rest—
Whose fiercest scorn ne'er sought a mark unjust,
Whose sharpest wit-shaft ne'er pained living breast
HAMPTON COURT ON SUNDAYS.
MR. W. C. SELLE, Qrganist at Her Majesty's Chapel at Hampton
Court, testifies, through the Times, that for “seven years” he has seen
the Sunday visitors to the gardens; all of them “quiet and respect-
able;” moreover, he never remembers “seeing a drunken character.”
MR. SELLE must be subject to ocular delusions. Has not a Reverend
divine (who doubtless ought to know) declared “Hampton Gardens on
Sundays a hell upon earth?’”
Tuere can be no doubt of it to pious folks who have their eyes. MR.
SELLE, in his obliquity, may behold in the drivers of holiday vans mere
mortal drivers; but that Reverend gentleman sees in them imps of Satan,
with snakes for whips. ... And then the curtains to the vans; they ma
seem white linen—but they really are black sackcloth. Just as the sand.
wiches and bottled beer are, in fact, when swallowed, ashes “from the

To be said or sung to the “Manes” of a Great Statesman,

Forgive the wish—whilst thou didst linger here-
That will not now, I hope, disturb thy rest.
Alas! I own I had an eye to Place
That hadst thou granted, 'twould have been all right:
And I should ne'er have suffered the disgrace
Of saying what I have to say to-night.
Thy policy was just, and good, and wise,

And it was only from a wish to rise,
That I thy noble statesmanship withstood.
For six long years an empty fight I’ve fought,
For all that time I’ve play’d a hollow game;
And now at last I’ve gained the prize I sought,
I must recant—or else resign the same.
Confiding Squires I cleverly have led
To realms of glowing moonshine, by the nose,
And trustful Farmers with my fine words fed—
Food I must eat myself, now, I suppose.

For thou didst but thy country's good pursue,

A BENJAMIN WITH TWO SIDES.
... We have seen advertised a new coat under the title of “an upper Ben-
jamin with two sides.” It professes to be a kind of coat to do double duty
-or two coats rolled into one. It is smooth outside, and rough within.
The smooth side is for the sun, for Regent Street, for the Park, for the
race-course-all those places where “a fashionable exterior.” (to quote
the choice phraseology of the tailor) is requisite. The rough is for the
rain, for outside the omnibus, for the Horticultural Fêtes, for Vauxhall,
for a visit to Lancashire, or any other place where showers are most
abundant. We do not know how far this economical combination may
answer—or whether the sensation of turning your coat, after it has done
raining, is an agreeable one to the skin, but we must say, we should
not exactly like having a Pilot, that has just been weathering the storm,
and conse "... dripping wet, hanging as close as a rheumatic
band round our body. It might be recommended by the hydropathic
Faculty, but as we are not so fond of walking about with wet clothes,
like an animated clothes-horse, we should i.j, prefer having a
separate coat for rainy weather, instead of a double coat, like #.
Benjamin, which would, probably, double one up in a very short time
with the rheumatism.
But we think we know a BENJAMIN that, also, has two sides. This
BENNAMIN, too, will turn his coat at the shortest notice. When he is
in he is smooth enough, but when he is out he is so rough that those
who come in contact with him fall in for a goodly share of hard rubs.
These two coats are extremely convenient, as the present ministry can
testify, for what would they be without their BENAMIN? One of the
coats is Free Trade. That is only displayed in fine weather, when the
sun in Downing Street is, shining, full upon Ministers. But directly
things begin to look a little black, the coat is turned immediately,
and they come out then with a bearish, roughish coat—a kind of wrap.
rascal—which is their suit of Protection. In this way, they change
their coat according to the weather, and are prepared at a moment's
notice for any turn that may take place in the political atmosphere.
At present, as everything looks fine and promising, the side of Free
Trade with Ministers is uppermost, but we all know that Protection
lurks underneath, and that they would not scruple in the least, if
a good breeze came on which was likely to blow in their favour, to turn
round to that side.
We may expect this coat to be in general use at the opening of
Parliament, or at all events, the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER
is sure to come out with it in great style, and to show off its two-fold
uses to the greatest advantage. In fact, it is a matter of great doubt
in our minds, if he is not the registered proprietor, inventor, and god-
father of this BENJAMIN witH Two SIDEs.
“MAIDSTONE VERSUS MACAULAY!”
*> 0 small a poet, is LoRD MAIDSTONE, that he
is scarcely visible to the naked eye: but the
smallest of things may be the most irritable.
Did not the learned, the philosophic Gassen-
DUs submit a very, º small insect—not
acknowledged in polite life—to the test of a
microscope P. And then, irritating the afore:
said insect for the º: of science, did
he not behold the blood, rush through and
through its heart, that little speck dilating
and contracting even as the heart of a giant?
Now what GAssENDUs did to that helpless
little creature, MR. MACAULAY has done to
poet Maidstone: showing him up, by his so
tent art, even as he is to the people of
ngland. MAIDSTONE, however, unlike the
victim of GAssenDUs, and like ORson in the
fairy tale, MAIDstone is endowed with reason;
and therefore he takes to himself a pen, and
with it pricks away at the oratorical historian
and M.P. for Edinburgh. MAIDSTONE says—and no doubt MACAULAY
trembles—"In the meantime “Gare a gui me touche / '" or, in plain
English, “Beware who touches me.” This is, a very awful warning,
but then, LoRD MAIpstone must perceive that such warning may
apply as well to weasels as to lions.
JUSTICE AT BATH.
In our last number but one, we felicitated SIB JAMEs RIVERs,
Bart., on the luck that brought him before a Bath Bench, charged with
violent assaults, instead of finding himself in the presence of MR.
HARDwick. We, moreover, condemned, the , Bath magistracy for
taking money of the Baronet, in lieu of packing him for awhile to gaol.
It seems that the Metropolitan Act alone enables º magis-
trates to do this; county and city Magistrates elsewhere can only
fine, and in default of payment, imprison. Thus, we would advise SIR
JAMEs Rivers to ponder well ere he tempts the dangers of London:
In the Metropolis, a “gentleman” given to assaults, may find himself
in the House of Correction with his hair cropped... But in the county
of Somerset, there would be a difference even with SoMERset. “Go
to Bath and get your head shaved,” does not apply to Baronets who
damage railway servants and policemen.
A Bishop in a Gig!

A LONG SITTING,

hours!” Terrible to think that, after such long sittings, so very little
has been hatched.
The Spirit of the Tablet.
In manifesting his approval of persecution as practised by the Tuscan
tyrant, MR. Lucas may be considered by his “ecclesiastical superiors”
to have gone—for the present, at least-a little too far; and perhaps
they will accordingly desire him to draw in his horns. But what will

CAPTIWITY OF ABD-EL-KADER.
ND will nobody rescue
ABD-EL-KADER.? Will
not his old, chivalrous
champion have pity on
him, and release him
from his present con-
dition? . He was, as-
suredly, in a sad plight in
the Château d'Amboise;
but surely he has been in
a more pitiable fix at St.
Cloud and the Tuileries.
It was bad enough to be
captive to the broken
faith of old Louis
PHILIPPE, gone to settle
many accounts of that
sort; but it is infinitely
worse to the Emir, more
degrading to him, to sing
the praises and kiss the
hand of the forsworn
tyrant who at this hour tramples on the French nation; the nation,
we grant, exhibiting no great reluctance to be so footed. -
“May you live as long as the sunl” cries ABD-EI-KADER, in all the
latitude of Eastern hyperbole. “I give you this sword,” answers the
tadpole Emperor, “and therefore I know you will never draw it against
me; for did not the French give me their confidence, and did I misuse
it *", “An oath is a solemn thing: it binds, like bonds of steel !”
cries the Emir, without a smile upon his face. “It is—it does,” makes
answer Louis NAPOLEoN, who does not thrust his tongue in his cheek.
And thus the poor Emir slavers the Emperor that is to be-and the
Emperor rejoices in the operation. Again, we cry, will mººdy release
ABD-EL-KADERP What ho! A LoNDonDERRY to the rescue!
THE EMPIRE OF BEADLEDOM.
THE release of BEN S1D1—commonly known as Seedy BEN-the
Lascar crossing-sweeper, has raised in the breast of that Eastern
scavenger a degree of gratitude towards the Beadle, which has some:
thing quite romantic in its character. Considering the determined
enemy that Seedy BEN has always proved himself towards the Arcade
and its Government, the devotion he now shows for the Beadle is quite
remarkable. The Lascar has again dined with the Beadle, who, as
Seedy BEN was about to retire, put into his hands a new broom. The
Lºcar was deeply affected, and hung round the gold lacº of the Beadle's
collar—in the Eastern ſashion—for several minutes....“I give you this
broom,” said the Beadle, “because I know you will never use it to
sweep a passage for the enemies of the Arcade.” Seedy BEN appeared
very anxious to make the Beadle understand that a Lascar's word is
as good as his bond—in black and white—and he pointed alternately to
his raven hair and his snowy petticoat. Kissing the broom, he dºclared
that he would never make it a handle for hostility to the Beadle, “and,”
added Seedy BEN, “rather than I would sweep a passage for your
enemies, I would go and scour the wide world alone.” The Lascar has
visited the Opera Arcade, where he was accommodated with a seat in
the private box—the well known watchbox about halfway down, and
nearly opposite the hairdresser's. This had the happiest effect.
The presents given by the Beadle on the occasion of his visit to the
Temple of Apollo were very numerous. To Miss REBEcca, who
recited “Le Beadledom c'est le PAY,” he presented his autograph on a
blank bill-stamp. To Signon JohnsonINI, the celebrated Gutta Percha
contortionist, fe gave a handsome bowl—formerly belonging to a
tobacco pipe in the possession of his uncle, BUMBLE I: The bowl was
filled for the occasion with a costly liqueur, in which SIGNOR John-
SONINI drank the health of the Beadle, while an attendant whistled the
Fºl. melody of “Drown it in the bowl.” . To SoAKEY_STEvens, the
Well-
ell-known comic singer, of the Temple of Apollo, the Beadle gave-
his hand, in a most condescending manner. The artist shook it with
much cordiality. The effect was excellent.
A Ticklish Point.
“FRIEND PUNCH,-There is one point which is peculiarly calculated
to "wound the just susceptibilities of a foreign nation,’ particularly in
the event of its making a descent on our shores. I mean the point of
the British bayonet. Had we not better give up that point, and
receive any enemies who may come to invade us with no other weapons
than open arms ? What sayest thou hereon to “ NEDDY GRILL P”

“MB. PENNY, late commander of the Lady Franklin and Sophia, has been honoured
by the DUKE of Northumberland with an interview, and has received a gratifying
acknowledgment of his own services and of those under his command from the present
Board of Admiralty.”
MR. PENNY being only Merchant-captain, PENNY, having, no
epaulets upon his shoulders, but simply brains schooled by long
experience in his head, was treated with the most contemptuous
neglect, all his counsel disregarded—which was afterwards proved to
be so wise and true—by the officers of “the service.” CAPTAIN
Austin returns home, having done nothing except “pooh-pooh" the
merchant skipper, and is thereupon appointed to a most lucrative poet
at Southampton. At length, however, the skipper is rewarded. Yes;
he is dignified for life “with an interview” of the First Lord of the
Admiralty; and receives “a gratifying acknowledgment of his ser-
vices !” By what means, may we ask, comes the acknowledgment?

tomers, and accord-
to everybody, even to
our enemies, and pre-
pare to give them, in
case they should in-
vade us, a civil re-

military one.
If an armed force
were to attack us,
our right course
would be to disarm
them by submission,
and then we should
perhaps be enabled
to buy their arms at
a bargain, and, having
bought the weapons
for less than their

them for more to the
allurs.
War is only theft
on the large scale.
Thieves are but in-
waders of society. We
have no more right
to repel an invasion
of our tills than a descent upon our shores. Therefore we should not only disband
our Militia but our Police. It would be advisable to post placards, reminding
young men disposed to enter the constabulary of the maims and bruises, to which
policemen are liable in the execution of their duty, and pointing out to them that
a CANNON's fist and heels may be as formidable as the cannon's mouth. The colds,
coughs, and rheumatisms, to which a policeman is exposed on his beat should also
be adverted to: and every possible argument urged tending to deter men from
undertaking the defence of our strong-boxes, and spoons, articles which are not
very much more valuable than our wives and jº. The blue cloth is as
objectionable as the red, and we ought all to be clothed in one uniform of drab.
WHAT CONSTITUTES AN EARTHQUAKE.
THERE has been lately some agitation in the North, which everybody seems to
admit was an earthquake. It may have been something of the sort, but we cannot
help being struck by the mildness and variety of the indications which have been
accepted as proofs of the occurrence of an earthquake. The Times says “Our
correspondent, who resides at Jericho, was awakened by a peculiar trembling sensa-
tion. All his joints appeared to be loosened.” We were not aware that, our
contemporary ever sent any of its correspondents to Jericho, and, though we have
heard occasionally of “the Times being out of joint,” we never heard of the Times
newspaper, or any of its correspondents being in that predicament. “At Seacombe
a fº was so much shaken while asleep,” that, on awaking, he didn’t know
what to make of it. Perhaps the gentleman had overslept himself, and the shaking
was administered to wake him up. He, however, prefers to take an earthquakerly
view of the matter.
MR, DonAIDson, of Gloucester Place, Edge Hill, says, with reference to a moise,
“At first I thought it was occasioned by the cat.” On second thoughts, not
exactly seeing how the cat jumped, he jumped, himself, to the conclusion that it
was an earthquake.
MR. BEAUCHAMP, of Bootle, finds his clock stopped, and sends up the fact as
evidence of an earthquake.
A gentleman, at Toxteth Park wakes “quite bewildered.” He looks at his
watch, and finding that it is half-past 4, he supplies further evidence of an
earthquake. -
º: Another º in Toxteth Park, finds his bed swinging like a cradle, and
some people next door jumped out of bed”—a piece of neighbourly sympathy
º 18 * difficulty in accounting for. Nevertheless, it ºf goes to prove an
earthquake.
Mr. CHADBURN."heard a noise as if a heavy person was walking across the room.
He raised himself in bed at once,” and wrote to the papers to confirm the rumour
of an earthquake.
. MR. Woop seems, to have been in a most absurd state of mind. The wooden
rings on his bed rattled. His first impression was that “a boy, who slept overhead,
had fallen out of bed.” But his next impression was that there had been an
earthquake.
CAPTAIN GREIG, head constable, “heard his earthenware shaken about and
"attled. , He got up, fancying some one had broken into the house, called up the
aan on duty at the station, and examined the roof of the building to set; that no
ingly should be polite
person was there.” Finding there was no person there, he
went to bed again with the comfortable conviction that
it was only an earthquake.
The reasoning faculties of those who felt the shock stem
to have been rather oddly affected, for the logic displayed
on the occasion is of the very lowest order. For instance:
“A manufacturer, feeling his bed shake, came to the con-
clusion that a servant in a room above had been seized with
a fit.” Why he should have drawn such an inference is not
very clear to us, but, finding himself mistaken, he admitted
his error, and pronounced the affair to have been a case of
earthquake. Even the dogs are dragged in as witnesses,
and the fact that some dogs trembled is cited as a proof
of this mild earthquake, which seems to have announced
itself by shaking curtains, imitating the sound of a jumping
cat, swinging beds, stopping a watch, intimidating a few
dogs, and loosening the limbs of an unfortunate corres.

A COUNTRYMAN AT CAMBRIDGE.
I went unto Cambridge my nevvy to see,
A studying at College to take his degree; . .
And in that endeavour I’m sure he won't fail,
Because they do drink such remarkable ale.
They brew a good liquor at Burton-on-Trent,
Where with I at one time was fully content;
But, seeing the tap which in Cambridge I find
There’s nothing inferior will equal my mind.
Your bitter ale’s very good physic and bark,
Not to name a Fº chemist's unguarded remark
But chemist nor druggist such stuff can't compound
As the beer which in Cambridge doth greatly abound.
For Whitbread's Entire they who like it may go,
And some may prefer BARCLAY, PERKINs, and Co.;
Let each man to hold his opinions be free,
The Cambridge particular's the tipple for me.
I’ve nothing to say 'gainst your foreign French wine
At two francs a bottle—’t is all very fine;
But where in all France is there drink to be got
Like our own native beverage at eightpence a pot?
I’m glad that my nevvy to Cambridge has gone,
A lad in his learning is safe to get on,
When he to preceptors and tutors is near
Who show such a great understanding in beer.
The only Female Reign of France.
The female descendants of Louis NApoleon are to be
excluded from succession to his Imperial crown. This
arrangement indicates a prejudice against petticoat govern-
ment, which is not wholly groundless; for, though we talk
of the golden reign of QUEEN ANNE, the French have not
had so much reason to boast of their An-archy.
“Here are your Fine Old Prejudices !”
IT is very singular the small number of foreigners,
Frenchmen especially, that are met with at the Diggings.
OLD WULGAR PREJUDICE, upon being asked the reason
why, replied, “Oh! foreigners, like the Gold well enough
but it's the process, which follows that they cannot bring

THE French Committee, in the report on the Constitu-
tion, observe that their country is “taxed with frivolity.”
France will be fortunate if the Empire shall involve no
heavier taxation.

THEATRE ROYAL, WESTMINSTER.
BY OUR SLASHING CRITIC.
HIS national establishment re-
opened for the season on Thursday
night with the comedy of Know
Your Own Mind, and a little original
after-piece called Quite Disgusted ;
or, Sibby's Sibillations. The house
was well filled, despite the un-
favourable weather.
An address was previously de-
livered, which had been written by
Mr. Dizzy, one of the managers.
Its success was decidedly owing to
the admirable manner in which it
was spoken. It was impossible not
to regret that the exquisite skill
and grace with which it was given
should have been bestowed upon a
composition every way unworthy of
such advantages, and it is really
from a feeling of respect to the
illustrious artist who spoke this address, that we abstain from coupling
the speech with a name justly endeared to the public. As soon as the
ear had ceased to be gratified with the finished delivery of the address,
and the eye began to criticise it in print (copies were to be had in the
house), it was impossible not to see that it was a shallow, and futile
affair, in which periods, and not ideas, were balanced, and in which
information was sought for in vain. We also regret to add that the
house was badly lighted, and that when the lights were turned on, the
glasses cracked and flew in all directions. The slamming of the box
doors, also, even during the address, was highly disgraceful even to
the proverbially negligent servants at this theatre.
The comedy comrcenced at the unusually early hour of five o'clock,
but was not over until past nine. We decidedly recommend MessRs.
DeRBy and Dizzy to cut it. The first part of the piece was spoken by
two young actors, new to London boards. One of them, MR. Low AINE
comes from the Northumberland theatre, where he recently supersede
an old and valuable artist, MR. G. GREY, to the dissatisfaction of all
who know what acing properly means. The other, M.R. EGERTON, is
unknown, but appears to have talent. The showy uniforms, worn by
both were very inappropriate. These actors produced a tolerable effect
in the scene where, both being supposed to advocate the same cause,
they flatly contradicted each other. The prompter seemed wanting to
his duty in this part of the performance. The veteran WILLIERS was
good as ever as Marplot, and elicited loud º when he denounced
the humbug of Vivian Grey; and he displayed a certain resolution
which delighted the audience. MR. WALPole went through the heavy
part of Wheedle with conscientiousness, but clearly does not understand
a joke. We were sorry to see MR. J. Russell, underact the important
character of Plucky, in which he used to be excellent-the scene
where he might have done so much, when walking into the cabinet,
was very tame, and though he rather warmed up for the fog joke,
his point was mist. MR. Dizzy of course played Wivian Grey,
but it was rumoured in the house that he had not expected to perform
that evening, and we would not, therefore, be hard on his short-
comings; the bit where he taunts Plucky with his inconsistency was
given with the old spirit, but he seemed obliged to keep close to the
flats, and was by no means at ease. MR. GLADSTONE, as the well-
meaning Hairsplit, was polished as ever, and the pleasantries of Young
Tomahawk lost none of their point in the hands of MR. OsBORNE. Mr.
CHRIstoph E.R. was very good as the bewildered clod-hopper, and his
penitence, and “bowing,” in order to keep his place, were deliciously
true to nature. CoBDEN, in the Cotton Farmer, played closely and
tellingly, and his concluding menace was very effective. A new
actor, named BALL, has the manner of a Methodist preacher, which,
however, suited well with the part of Croak, but he was too tedious
over his papers, beside blundering the real point about his corn, which
Croak foolishly fancies Marplot has trodden on, whereas it is his own
clumsiness that hurts him. BALL did not see this, we think. We
must add that the tag was capitally spoken by M.R. PALMERSTON,
who was loudly applauded for the capital humour with which he
acknowledged the perfect frankness of Wivian and Wheedle, but gently
intimated that he should like to know what they meant. The fault of
the play is the deficiency of female interest, but the old women were
well personated by those stock artists, New DeGATE, and ADDERLEy;
Hºnor at the supposed goblin, Cheaploaf, was very anile and
Ilatural.
The aſter-piece, Quite Disgusted, was a mere monologue by MR. SIR-
THORP, and, we believe, his own composition. It was delivered with
much earnestness and intensity, and for those who like broad
buffoonery, will doubtless have its attraction, but we should suggest
its taking its natural place in the Christmas pantomime, as it evidently
belongs either to Clown or Pantaloon, or both. Several hands were
raised during its progress, but it did not seem to strike the gallery.
The next novelty will be a farce, called The Budget, to be followed,
as early as º: by, a pièce de circonstance, entitled The Sack, in
which MR. Dizzy is said to have a fine erit. It also contains a monster
chorus of revolting agriculturists, called “Why did our Master sell
us?” A startling novelty, Cupid in Downing Street, has also been
under consideration, but is not yet underlined.

it is high time,

it should now be in-
serted. Our reason
for advocating the
insertion is this.

be President of Francº, he would have shrugged his shoulders, and have
cried “IMpossIBLE | * Supposing, two years ago, the same authority had
been informed that Louis Nºrodeos would dissolve the Chambers,
have an African razzia on the Boulevards, and instal himself Autocrat
de tous les Français, he would have put his hand upon his sword, and
have exclaimed indignantly “IMPossIBLE"" And supposing, again,
that same Frenchman had been told, whilst his countrymen were being
shot on the Champ-de-Mars worse than pigeons at the Red House,
that that same Louis NAPoleon would, before a year is over, be

But all the above events have taken place, and are thought no more
of than a monkey-race at the Hippodrome. We think, therefore, with
the above testimonials in its favour, the word has a perfect right to be
received once more into the bosom of the French Dictionary. This note
might be appended to it :—

Neveu, NApoleon LE PETIT.”—Wide Passim.

Curiously enough, the word would come in most significantly between
“Imposition” and ‘Imposteur.” . It would feel itself, therefore, quite at
home—just as comfortable as if it were at the Elysée.
LIGHT IN UNCLE TOM'S CABIN.
ThE EARL OF Shaft Esbu Ry has published the form of an address
from Englishwomen to the women of America on the subject of slavery.
MRs. BEECHER Stowe's spirit is triumphant in this movement. His
lordship well says “In the days in which we live more is to be perma-
nently effected by public opinion, and by appeals to the great
sympathies of mankind, than by force or by statute laws.” There can
be no doubt of it: and whereas the fetters of the slave have been made
the heavier, and rivetted the faster by the statutes of the men of the
American Congress, so let them be lightened and finally cast aside for
ever by American women—the legislators of the American fireside.
The Reign of the Empire, How Begotten.
M. Thoplong-in his trop-long document touching the Empire, says
“This reign, gentlemen, will not be cradled in the midst of arms, and
in the camp of insurgent, Praetorian guards.” Certainly not; history
will chronicle quite another, origin. Reviewing the military feles, at
Versailles, º will say—“The reign of NAPOLEON III. was cradled
in a sausage, and was baptised with champagne.” How it will end
prophecy deposeth not. It may, like sausage-meat, tumble into smallest
pieces—and, like champagne, go off in pop and fluster.

Persuaded my dupes I'd been really so clever
As to find out the secret of living for evet.

You see, as I saw, that in dealing with man,

Promise on, leaving Fortune our words to fulfil:

Is certain the more people think #. 'll redeem it ;

It recalls, in a half-gay, half-sorrowful tone,
The days when it sought the philosopher's stone,
And surveys all the sources whence income may flow,
As it once did its crucibles ranged in a row.
Then, perchance, it remembers the trick which it played
When a Burgher of Lubeck your victim was made,
Who, whilst giving your furnace his closest inspection,
As you’d told him to wait for the hour of projection,
Chanced to let his gold sleeve-button fall in the pot
At the time when the lead and the pewter were hot ;
Whilst you, who, ere he did, detected his loss,
With your melting fork plunged it deep down in the dross-
Fished it out on the point—to its owner displayed it-
And exultingly cried, “It is Gold, and I’ve made it !”
It can scarcely be needful for me to explain
Such a trick you may possibly practise again.
If you look in the Downing Street desks, you will find
That the Whigs left a good many measures behind
Which, if doctored with care, rather better will do
For the people, than aught manufactured by you.
And if Russell or HUME should indignantly cry
“You have stolen my measure | * be sure to reply
As you did to the Burgher, “My friend, it may be
That you had such a button as this which you see,
But this button is mine, and its likeness to yours
My skill in the making of buttons assures.”
Just persuade them of this, and old FoEMAN or DEE,
KENELM DIGBY, and LILLY, shall all yield to thee,
And ALBERTUs the Great, by his Brazen Head known,
Shall confess it is greatly surpassed by your own.

THE CHAMBERLAIN AND THE CLOWNS.
The gentlemen engaged at the various, theatres to perform the
arduous and very responsible part, of Clown in the forthcoming
Christmas pantomimes had an audience last week of the LoRD
CHAMBERLAIN. The event has hitherto not been noticed in the Court
Circular, for which, probably, his lordship has his own reasons. Mr.
Punch, however, has been favoured with what he believes to be a punc-
tiº correct account of the interview. -
His lordship received the Clowns very graciously; jocosely remark-
ing that he considered them the embodied "gaiety of nations.” He
was old enough to remember, when a child, Hot Codlins as sung by the
immortal GRIMALDI ; whose Tippitywitchet (by the bye, WALPole gave
it capitally, sneezes and all, at the last whitebait dinner) would “never
from his mind.” With this, his lordship waved the deputation to seats.
Being seated, one of the Clowns, with true holiday unction cried “Here
we are l’” A shout of laughter followed, in which his lordship joined.
His lordship then observed that he had given them the required
audience that—as they had appealed to him against certain erasures in
the Christmas pantomimes-they might talk the matter over. His
lordship would begin with the pantomime of the Adelphi.

In other places the force has made itself especially popular;
and the good manners and sobriety of the men have been
emphatically acknowledged. Nevertheless, the militia are
hateful in the eyes of FRY, who glares at a red coat like
any bull. Moreover he has discovered that, as one militia-
man has been tried for burglary, a yearning for felony must
consequently, pervade the whole force. This is not liber
of FRY, so tolerant of the intentions of foreigners; and so

may be considered as something extraordinary. It is a
fact known to his friends that, should the French invade
us, FRY is prepared to carry out his principles of non-
resistance, by going to bed—even with the French army in
London—with his door on the latch. As a further illustra-
tion of his confiding spirit, let us suggest that he should
write on his door-post—“Rubbish shot here.”
CRITICAL MOMENTS.
The newspaper musical criticisms are by no means so
remarkable for “learning” as they used to be, and, though
the change is certainly for the better in some respects,
we must nevertheless admit that the absence of the
obscurity which used to prevail is likely to be felt by those
who think that mystery and unintelligibility are sources of
critical sublimity. e are afraid we have rather dis-
heartened the more recondite gentlemen of the press by our
own, displays of “learning” in musical matters, and since
we have §: our scholarship in criticising the per-
formances of the promenade (street) concerts, we have
missed, in the criticisms on Julli EN's concerts, that pro-
fundity which used to admit of our tumbling out of our
depth into flats and sharps of the most acute point and
counterpoint.

of political warfare. The next, if you please?

Finally, the Loan CHAMBERLAIN refused to re-consider his opinions;
and the deputation broke up, the Clowns protesting that if they were
thus restricted in their profession, they would have nothing for it but
to leave HER MAJesty's Ministers to get up and play in the
pantomimes themselves.
AMARUM ALIQUID.
The late Lord MAyor (HUNTER), in resigning the Civic mace,
expressed his delight that it would descend on the head of agentleman
(Ch.Allis) so admirably qualified to receive it. We really think the Civic
digni'aries should be a little more particular in what they say about each
other, for, if we were ill-naturedly disposed, we might ask why the
head of the new Lord Mayor is so especially fitted for the descent of
a huge mace upon it, and whether there is a peculiar thickness in the
heads of the City which enables them to come into contact with
onderous instruments, and be none the worse for the collision ? .The
ate LoRD MAYoR congratulated himself also on giving up the insignia
without a stain; from which we infer that the gold trappings of the
Mayoralty were subjected to a severe leathering, and a vigorous
polishing of the º, before they were transferred from the neck

SMALL-POX AND FREE-TRADE SHEEP.
Ms. E. BALL, M.P. for Cambridgeshire,
in his enumeration of the
many pestilent evils of
Free-Trade, has made it
known to the world that
the first Free-Trade sheep
imported into England
brought with them a new

at the time-have lately proved the mischief abiding in them. Sooner or later, we knew
they would publish it; and published it they have within these few days in, the most
alarming, manner: , Lancashire, Cheshire, and part of Ireland, have been visited by, an
earthquake. Will MR. E. BAiL believe—but, of course, he will—that the shocks of that
farthquake were originally smuggled, although long latent in those Flee-Trade jackasses?
What a, retribution upon Manchester, if Marchester chimneys had been toppled to the
earth, and all along of Frte-Trade donkeys:
THE NATIONAL BETHLEHEM AND ITS CHIEF.
The non-restraint system of treating lunatics is very humane, but SIR PETER LAURIE
has much truth on his side; and there are some cases in which the opposite, plan alone will
answer, and is found to be the happiest for the unfortunate patients in the end. An example
of this sort exists in the Nº." Bethlehem, which is situated between the 42nd and 51st
parallels of latitude, and the 5th and 8th degrees of longitude.
This deranged community possesses, in a great measure, the extraordinary power of con:
stituting its own Government. Twenty-three years ago its director was a man called Dix,
whose Christian name was CHARLEs. In 1830 its inmates became uncontrollable, kicked
out Dix, and put one. Lewis PHILLIPs in his room. Eighteen years after that, in another
paroxysm, they also kicked out PHILLIPs, and after abrief interval of anarchy under Provisional
Keepers, chose Lewis NAP, their present ruler.
NAP had, in PHILLips's time, twice attempted to oust Phillips and usurp his place
forcible descent on the Institution. On the second of these cocasions fe entered
by a
the
premises with about half-a-dºzen associates and a tame eagle, on whose wings he tried to
persuade the patients that they were all to fly away with him to glory... But before he had
sufficiently excited their frenzy, he was seized by Phillips, who shut him up in the Ham
Ward, triating him as if he, NAP himself, were an unfortunate person not fit to be at large.
NAP, however, in spite of all PHILLIPs's precautions, contrived after some time to escape
from confinement.
During the interval of singing, dancing, and fighting which followed the ejection of
PHILLIPs, several men of character and ability offered themselves as candidates for the
superintendency of the Bethlehemites; but they, remembering the tame eagle, preferred
Lewis NAP to all these, by a vast majority. NAF was to hold the situation for four years,
according to a sort of arrangement, called a iv. that they had made amongst them.
Besides NAP, they had appointed a body of Keepers, with the view railer to keep him in
chick than themfelves in order, NAP very soon ſound that these Keepers and he could not,
*s the saying is, put their horses together at all. They overdid their business by thwarting
him in everything,, and in the meantine the establishment was in a very dangerous state.
The patients had planted a quantity of timber, which they expected to bear apples; and
there were three maxims which they had constantly in their mouths, and which were chalked
and scrawled about everywhere: “Our own Way,” “Everybody alike;” and “All Brothers
and Sisters.” Now it was quite clear to Nar that, if these wild notions were carried out,
as they threatened soon to be, the patients would begin to make bonfires in their beds, -
and to chop of the heads of the taller among them, and stretch the necks of the shorter,
in order to render, themselves all of a size. A cry of “No meum and tuum,”—which meant
simply, “No tuum"—had also been raised, and some were prepared to assert universal brother-
hood and sisterhood to such an extent as to
abolish matrimony. Those who entertained these
views went about in red caps, proclaiming their
intention to enforce them as soon as they could.
NAP saw that this kind of thing would never
do; so, early one morning, he seized upon
several of the most powerful Keepers, and put
them in confinement, sent the rest about their
business, and took the management of the Insti-
tution entirely into his own hands. But this
act was contrary to an affidavit which MR. NAP
had made at his appointment; and it does not
appear that thered-cap maniacs were somumerous
that he could not have awaited their breakin
º and then have put them under specia
restraint, without coercing as well the whole of
the patients.
He occupied the establishment with armed
men; who, some symptoms of disturbance ap-
rearing in the central portion of it, flung a
shower of bullets through the windows of the
more decent and rational of the inmates, kncckin
them over in heaps, in order, it was supposed,
to frighten or encourage the others. The wor
of command was now Hush! and whoever dis-
obeyed it was laid hold of and shut up. Thou-
sands were taken ºff-deported, as the phrase is
—and incarcerated in the Cayenne Branch esta-
blishment. As in some other asylums, the inmates
had been allowed the use of paper and printing-
presses, and were accustomed to publish pe-
riodicals; these he either suppressed altogether,
or placed under the most absolute control. In
the meanwhile, he asked the patients to º
the tenure of his situation for ten years, an
they, in a transport of strange enthusiasm, voted
accordingly.
Finding his discipline so singularly well relished,
Lewis NAP has very naturally persevered in it,
to the increasing delight and gratification of the
patients, whose ecstasy has at last risen to such
a height that they now actually worship him.
Not content with hailing him Emperor, they call
him BooDH, BRAMAH, Wishnu, and Jupitek;
mayors, in various departments, say their prayers
to him; garlands are strewn in his way; and
young female patients, clad in white with green
sashes, dance round him, offering him flowers.
They are now about to constitute him their
Supreme Ruler. A statue, it is said, will shortly
be erected to him with the following inscription
on its pedestal:-
“A. L. N., EMPEREUR.
Pourt sA CAMISOLE DE FORCE
UNE PATRIE *Econnaissante.”
He has, they say, saved the Bethlehem. That
means, le has saved the Bethlehemites from
themselves. They rejoice in his autocracy. We
may not like such a system for our Asylum;
but we must let our neighbours enjoy their own
management peaceably, so long as they will only
leave us at peace.

MORALS OF THE “DIGGINGS.”
EveRY ounce of gold discovered at Melbourne reflects its
light upon an English fireside. When nuggets turn up at
the Antipodes, families in Lancashire may rejoice at the
good fortune. Here is a touching proof of the fact;
shewing how the adventurers at one side of the world have
their hearts beating towards their kindred at the other:
“In one year the Bank of Australia remitted from depositors £4,364–
no trifling contribution, when we consider the severe labºur undergone
in acquiring it. The receivers are—106 parents, 11 wives, 221 brothers
and sisters, 64 children, besides other relations. We may well suppose
that this succour is but the beginning. Each mail will probably bring
an increase of means to those left in England.”
This return, we are further told, is authenticated by
CAPTAIN Chisholm who, at Melbourne, speeds the good
work begun and hourly pursued by his noble wife, in
London: work undertaken for the nob'est ends, and by
the purest and most disinterested means; MRs. Chisholm
working alone to aid wives and children in their desire to
join husbands and fathers; working, that the pinched and
despairing English labourer and artisan may become the
robust, the rejoicing Australian settler. Centuries hence,
Australia will vencrate the name of the Chisholms;
though, at the present moment, it is probable that our
Secretary for the Colonies, except “through the papers,”
has never heard of them.
The Cabinet and the Fine Arts.
The QUEEN's Speech contained—for such a document
—a strange homage to the claims of science and the fine
arts. Who knows what may be in store for letters with an
author in the Exchequer? A very, recent instance proves
the tenderness of the FARL of DERby to the claims of
litcrature. His lordship was solicited to bestow a pension
on the widow of Doctor BIRKBECK, originator of, and
most liberal contributor to. Mechanics' Institutes. Some
acknowledgment of her husband's services would have been
welcome to MRs. Birkbeck, and Lord DERby made the
munificent offer of fifty pounds a year ! An offer court-

THE SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF FOREIGNERS.
We rejoice that the Press prevented the concºalment of the foreign,
flags taken by the late illustrious Duke, and which, it is said, were to
have been huddled somewhere out of sight during the Lying in State,
lest their being seen might “hurt the tusceptibilities of foreigners.”
If we are to begin c º the “susceptibilities of foreigners,”
we stall have to hide a great deal that we always thought we ought
to be proud of, instead of its being our duty to put it out of the way.
A clean face might almost be considered hurtful to the susceptibilities
of some of those dirty-bearded gentlemen who intest the parlieus
of Regent Street occasionally; and we might on this principle be afraid
to show our faces, for fear of offending the possessor of some outlandish
frontispiece composed of hair and dirt.
The next thing we might be called upon to do, perhaps, would be to
surrender our librrties and our happy form of Government, lest we
might hurt the susceptibilities, of those foreigners who belong to
countries in which there is no liberty to be enjoyed. Ltt them do a
they like abroad, as far at least as tyranny will allow them—and really
some of them seem so degraded, as to be worthy of nothing else—but
we must take leave to do exactly as we think proper amongst ourselves
i. home. Those who don't like our ways had better keep away
rom us.
Perhaps the next thing we may be expected to do will be to abolish
our Navy, lest its efficiency should “hurt the susceptibilities”—and
hurt ºf else, too, we hope—of those who might be inclined tº
honour us with a descent upon our shores. If this over-nicety about
the feelings of foreigners should grow upon us, we should have to shut
up our cook-shops for fear of hurting, the susceptibilities of son-
hungry Socialist or Red Republican, with an unwholesome thirst for
blood, and an equally unhealthy horror of roast beef and plum puddin ,
or other good and salubrious English fare. We might as ..". |

JUSTICE TO LUCAS.
REALLY poor MR. Ltcas is very ill used º his
own brothers in arms, comrades of the Irish
Brigade, and sons of the Holy Father. Not
only do they in many ins'ances disavow his
scniments r. specting the Tuscan persecu-
tion, but, in some, ºven abuse him for holding
them. It is a shame for them, at any rate,
to denounce and decry him, for opinions
which, as he says—truly no doubt—in his
letter to SERJEANT SHEE,
* I hold in common with every bishop and every
priest in this country and in England, whose senti-
ments have been made known to me, and with nine
out of every ten Catholic laymen with whom I have
communicated."
Before Setueant Siter and his liberal associates disown the perce-
cuting tenets of Mr. Lucas, they should endeavour tº understand what
they are talking about—namely, their own religion. Perhaps, however,
º an exertion of their intellect might be fatal to their faith, or, at all
events, to their enthusiasm in its behalf. MR. Lucas, who was once a
Quaker, probably investigated his creed, before embracing it. They
must not blame him

for holding it logically. Of cºurse, if he were in

All the Romish clergy, and nine-tenths of the laity with whom, he has

opinion is an infinite evil, and any lesser evil is preferable to that
which is infinite, they necessarily would be prepared to oppose such
evil with indefinite stakes, unlimited faggots, and thumbscrews, racks,
and all other instruments of torture without end. They are, gº;
-i-tently ready to go the whole hog-as the hog was gone in Smithfield
when Popey ruled the roas. MR. Serjeant Shek, has no right to

womaned-for we believe a char-woman is the only official regularly attached to the Arch—it
is doubtful whether, in case of an attack from the West, anything like resistance could be
. It is true there is a sort of picket planted on the eastern side, in the shape of the City
pikeman, who takes toll of the caravansera entering the Civic States ; but it must be
JOHN BULL’S NEW TROUBLES.
remembered that the Bar is already passed when
that tribute is exacted, and that the pikeman
might be easily surrounded, surprised, and put to
the whip, before any help could be obtained from
the Bar, even supposing there should be any at
hand, which is quite improbable.
If Temple Bar is to be kept as a civic defence,
it is only reasonable that the whole of the
Cockney lines should be ſortified, for we do not
see why the West End should be the only point
at which invasion is to be looked for. Why, for
instance, should there be any special faith put
in the wild and wandering tribes of Clerkenwell,
who might pour down their native hills of Saffron
overrunning the vast plain of Farringdon an
bubbling over into Bridge Street, thus swamping
the fair levels of Cockney Land at their most
valuable point, which lies at the foot of the rich
Hill of Ludgate.
If Temple Bar is to be preserved, surely Black-
friars should be fortified, and Cannon Street de-
fended by a restoration of the imaginary cannons
from which it may have possibly obtained its title.
We would, however, propose, the abolition of
Temple Bar, which fortifies the City against
nothing but its friends and customers. The
only difficulty might be with the barber who
has planted himself firmly in the base of the
fabric, and in the affections of his customers;
but there is no doubt that upon a reasonable
compensation he would march out with the
honours of war, so that the Bar might be rased
to the ground, and all having businets in the
City might be able to
“March on without impediment."

LET MR. CoPPock borrow a bint from the way in which the shop-
A MAN can't have just what he wants, and no more;
It never will rain but 'tis certain to pour:
A few years ago, my entire botheration
Was having on hand a too large population.
“Confound it !” I them was accustomed to say,
“I wish I could send half these people away—
These paupers, consuming the fruits of the earth,
And eating up ten times as much as they’re worth.”
I could not check their increase and multiplication,
And wish'd I could bring about cheap Emigration:
Emigration I’ve got, with a vengeance, at last,
l'm losing my superabundance too fast.
There won't be a servant for hire to be had;
We shall all have to clean our own boots, Sir, egad!
Our wives will be soon forced to cook us our chops,
And scrub their own floors, Sir, and twirl their own mops.
Can nothing be done to induce folks to stay?
Increasing their comforts might be a good way—
Rebuilding, and draining, and cleansing our towns,
Early closing our shops and instructing our clowns.
And then, Sir, there's Gold. I should once have cried, “Stuff!”
Had you said I could ever have more than enough:
But now I am plagued with a surplus of riches
That I can't dispose of in bank, coat, or breeches.
Indeed, I'm afraid, like that CRAssus of old,
That I shall be finally choked with my gold,
It being my doom that hard diet to cram on
Because I so long have been worshipping MAMMON.

keepers of the Strand and Fleet Street have been expressing their
grief for the death of the DUKE, by exposing in their shop-windows a

in his own philanthropic, patriotic way, expose in the windows of the
Carlton Club a model of all the Parliamentary Seats which he has for
sale, and ticket upon each the lowest price for which it is to be bought.
It might induce many a rich customer, eager to tack M.P. on to his

“I shall just give you a few preliminary reasons why I happen to be
here. From #. accent, the people would never know me to be a
Scotchman.” The fact is, I left Scotland some years ago. I know
you laugh here. But, why do we leave Scotland? I will tell you. In
the first place, we are naturally an adventurous people, and desirous of
spreading civilisation. That was my first impulse. Secondly, I was
desirous of seeing the world. Thirdly, I wished to study the manners
of the Eastern nations. Fourthly, I love commercial pursuits. And,
also, I should add, the property of Bluter was, in my youth, not what it
mediode.

“People may say what they like about the causes of these changes.
There are some who pretend that the property was a mere bit of hard
hilly land at the best, and that it could not be expected to maintain an
increasing family. This has a superficial air of reasonableness about it.
But º: the real cause of our ruin was a large hospitality. In
the old times in this neighbourhood, the way they managed hospitality
was this. Half-a-dozen lairds were perhaps on friendly terms. Well?
they all went to live at each other's houses by turns; and by the time
the sixth establishment was exhausted, the first was replenished. It
was at one of these feasts that my excellent grandfather breathed his
last, in what, Idare say, you fellows consider a somewhat remarkable way.
He was always a good eater; and he liked his tumbler, my dear Punch.
They had sat at table at the house of DALzell of The ScAUR for a
couple of days. Somehow, or other, the old gentleman had been silent
for a little, and presently the LAIRd of KIISHILLAN called out across
the table, ‘Guide us! BLUTER's looking gash!! which, being inter-
preted, means ‘pale.’. ‘Gash!” said the hospitable host, “he’s been
deed these twa hours, but I wouldna disturb the company.’
“Ah, those were the days! But I must not linger over the past.
They laid the old gentleman's moist clay with that of his ancestors.
My father found the lands of Bluter too much burdened to be longer
tenable. They passed, Sir, into the hands of the great EARLs of MUIR-
Fowl. .You must have observed, my dear Editor, that properties are
. quicksilver-the big knobs attract the little ones, and swallow
em up.
“It has been the dream of my life to recover Bluter. I have bought

Qr trot through any Scotch county, and ask the boy, who is carrying
the letter-bag to the little place inside the fir-trees. You will find, ten

But to my more immediate “notes.”
“It is a mercy we were not run into just before we got to Carlisle.
They did what they could—I’ll do then the justice to say that—as far
as stopping went. But we got on—though for some time not much
quicker than the train from Naples to Castel-a-mare—though it is driven

countries ) . I was, myself, in a state of agitation more than once in
the second-class carriage—I always travel in the second class, by the
bye; I prefer it—and scarcely able at times to continue my converse
with the gentleman opposite. This was a schoolmaster taking his boys
home with him—who wondered, poor little fellows, to hear me chatting
so familiarly with their master. I am afraid I was wrong about the
longitude of Rio Janeiro, which came up in the course of conversation,

herself in the opposite corner, and plunged into Uncle Tom's Cabin/

did ask me this is not staying at Eaglestail—but spends most of his
time at the wretched little §.... in DRUMSLEEKIE (such a table

I got a fellow to carry my portmanteau to the Eaglesham Arms.
I gave him a shilling. It would ill become a M'SPLEUCHAN of
BLUTER to sneer at his countrymen; but I remarked then—and have
since—a certain elation and surprise manifested by the recipient of a
shilling, hereabouts, which—but let us not be satirical. Only note
this, also, that if the unexpected amount, awakens admiration for your
generosity, that sentiment is blended with compassion for your

“I hate your orations, and great receptions. This made me shy in

ODE TO THE GREAT SEA-SERPENT ON HIS
WONDERFUL REAPPEARANCE.
From what abysies of the unfathom'd sea
Turnest thou up, Great Serpent, now and then,
If we may venture to believe in thee,
And affidavits of seafaring men?
What whirlpool gulf to thee affords a home?
Amid the unknown depths where dost thou dwell?
If-like the mermaid, with her glass and comb-
Thou art not what the vulgar call a Sell.
Art thou, indeed, a serpent and no sham”
Or, if no serpent, º eel,
An entity, though modified by ſlam,
A basking shark, or monstrous kind of seal?
I'll think that thou a true Ophidian art;
I cannot say a reptile of the º:
Because thou dost not play a reptile's part;
Thou swimmest, it appears, and dost not creep.
The Captain was not WALKER but M'QUHAE,
I'll trust, by whom thou some time since wast seen;
And him who says he saw thee t'other day,
I will not bid address the corps marine.
Sea-Serpent, art thou venomous or not *
What sort of snake may be thy class and style?
That of Mud-Python, by Apollo shot,
And mentioned—rather often—by CARLYLEP
Or, art thou but a serpent of the mind?— .
Doubts, though subdued, will oft recur again—
A serpent of the visionary kind,
Proceeding from the grog-oppressed brain?
Art thou a giant adder, or huge asp,
And hast thou got a rattle at thy tail?
If of the Boa species, couldst thou clasp
Within thy folds, and suffocate, a whale?
How long art thou?—Some sixty feet, they say,
And more—but how much more they do not know:
Ifancy thou couldst reach across a bay
From head to head, a dozen miles or so.
Scales hast thou got, of course—but what’s thy weight?
On either side 'tis said thou hast a fin,
A crest, too, on thy neck, deponents state,
A saw-shaped ridge of flabby, dabby skin.
If I could clutch thee—in a giant's grip-
Could I retain thee in that grasp sublime? ..
Wouldst thou not quickly through my fingers slip,
Being all over glazed with fishy slime?
Hast thou a forked tongue—and dost thou hiss
If ever thou art bored with Ocean's play?
And is it the correct hypothesis
That thou of gills or lungs dost breathe by way?
What spines, or spikes, or claws, or nails, or fin,
Or paddle, Ocean-Serpent, dost thou bear? -
What kind of teeth show'st thou when thou dost grinº-
- A set that probably would make one stare.
- What is thy diet? Canst thou gulp a shoal
Of herrings? Or hast thou the gorge and room
To bolt fat porpoises and dolphins, whole,
By dozens, e'en as oysters we consume?
Art thou alone, thou serpent, on the brine,
The sole surviving member of thy race?
Is there no brother, sister, wife, of thine,
But thou alone afloat on Ocean's face?
If such a calculation may be made,
Thine age at what a figure may we take? . .
When first the granite mountain-stones were laid,
Wast thou not present there and then, old Snake?
What fossil Saurians in thy time have been?
ow many Mammoths crumbled into mould?
What geologic periods hast thou seen,
Long as the tail thou doubtless canst unfold?
As a dead whale, but as a whale, though dead,
Thy floating bulk a British crew did strike;
And, so far, none will question what they said,
That thou unto a whale wast very like.
A flock of birds a record, rather loose,
Describes as hovering o'er thy lengthy hull;
Among them, doubtless, there was many a Goose,
And also several of the genus Gull.
THE DUKE'S LAST HONOURS.
THE DUKE has been buried in honour—in so far as he could be
buried, which was merely as to the outer-shell and under-uniform of the
Great Man and Soldier. He has been entombed with all the *
and circumstance—if not with the pride—of military ceremony, an
heraldic show; in all the solemn magnificence that could be devised,
without regard to expense, which will be enormous.
Now parade, in itself, demonstration of gilt and silver, uniforms and
liveries, emblazoned carriages, and regiments marching in state, is a
questionable thing; and, it may be asked, “Was all this right?—was it
wise?” The Duke of WELLINGTon deserved more respect than we
could show him; our ostentation, after all, fell short of our purpose;—
wº it rational, was it good?
es.
May existing peace be ever unbroken! But now, when Liberty over
all Europe is extinct, what would not Continental despots and bigots
give to tread out its fire conserved and still blazing in this little
island? It was well and judicious to advertise them and the world
with what enthusiasm we yet honour military heroism: that if we have
º: the love of strife, we have not renounced the spirit of valour.
ery fit and proper also, just at this time, was it that themation should
declare at how much it values the principles of the extreme Pacificators;
preachers of meek submission to foreign chastisement: well meaning
doubtless; and therefore all the harm that we wish MR. FRY an
MR. BRIGHT is, that they witnessed last Thursday's ceremony, and
had good places. -
But for these considerations, the pageantry of sepulture would be
º simply more absurd than any other. Better, indeed, would it
ave been, if possible—but it was not possible—that the remains of the
Duke should have descended into the tomb amid the silent reverence
of his countrymen. May it be long before we lose another great man
—when we have one to lose—but then may his burial be that of SIR
Robert PEEL.
PLEASING ECCLESIASTICAL INTELLIGENCE.
UR opinion is
that “there's
a good time
coming” for
the , Estab-
lished Church
-perhaps. In
Convocation,
the other day,
the Bishop
of Exeter is
related by the
Times to have
thus spoken:
“But, mylords,
this I know, that
there are many
in this Church,
very, very many,
who, if the time
- should evercome
that the Church should declare itself incompetent to its essential duties and its vital
action, will leave it. I, for one, will leave this Church if that time should ever come.”
As the Bishop of ExETER stands in a considerable minority on the
question of what the vital action and essential duties of the Church are,
there is really some hope that the declaration which he alludes to will,
one of these days, appear to him to have been made. The Bishop adds,
“I will not go to Rome.”
For the best of all reasons. Virtually, has he not already gone?
The French Schoolmaster.
THE Minister of Public Instruction has been received at Lille with
all the honours of war. It is quite right that Louis Napoleon's
schoolmaster should teach the young idea how to shoot. The
Lancastrian plan gives writing-lessons in sand; the schoolmaster at
Lille improves on this—turning the sand into gunpowder.

THE MAGPIE OF THE EXCHEQUER.
MR. DisrAELI's wonderful recitation
of a speech delivered by M.
ThIERs on the MARSHAL De
St. CYR, as his own original
tribute to the memory of the
DUKE, has elicited numerous
remarks from various parties.
The following are a few of
them :-DIsrAELI's funeral
oration was only Tears. The
eloquence of Tears was the best
of his oratory. Tears did not
choke, but assisted his utter-
ance. All who heard him were
drowned in Tears. ... His Cheek,
brazen as it was, glittered with
Tears. His Tears gushed forth
at every word. His fluency is
a flow of Tears. His Hippo-
crene is a fountain of Tears.
He shed Tears that no pocket-
handkerchief can wipe away.

º, a misty something
E looming in the future: it was

- - a loan from THIERs. His poli-
tical last speech will have been made in Tears. He was to have
jumped into a quart bottle, but he has put his Tears into his bottle
instead, and put nothin else but his foot in it. If Pºros is
the judicious bottle-holder, DisBAELI is the injudicious CRIBB of the
political Prize Ring.
A portrait of The CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer figured at the
Exhibition last year. The public may like to have another picture of
this eminent Statesman as he appeared when he uttered his obituary dis-
course—with the words of Thiers on his tongue. Such a subject can
only be treated emblematically. Now, BENJAMIN is the Government's
mouth-piece in the House of Commons. Credit was always given him
for ability to talk; it was believed that on all subjects he had some-
thing, at least, to say for himself. Whatever speech he might make, we
were assured, would be appropriate—not appropriated. It now, how-
ever, is clear that he talks by rote, and that, too, on a theme on which,
of all others, he might have been expected to evince heart—instead of
merely repeating what he had learned thereby. Thus, the idea of a
parrot is suggested as a fitting representative for the Member who
represents Bucks. A jackdaw in borrowed plumes would be preferable;
but that character has been pre-assigned to some other pretender. A
complete type of our second-hand orator is exhibited by the Magpie.
The plumage of this well-known individual of the feathered race
corresponds to the political colours of the Protectionist Free-Trader
-being black and white. The magpie's furtive propensities, too, render
it a suitable type of the pilferer—in a Parliamen sense—of shining
things. Though not born to riches, the author of Cowingsby-unless
Coningsby is a translation—was generally supposed to have been born
with a silver spoon in his mouth—the wealth of eloquence. His silver
spoon, however, turns out to be another's ..". and, like the
Filching Magpie of dramatic celebrity, he has hopped off with the
spoon of M. THIERs in his beak.
Temple Bar Doomed.
No doubt of º: Bar must come down. Nevertheless, we
would wish—for the sake of its comparative antiquity—to have its
architecture in some way preserved. Hence, we propose it should be
adapted to a new frontage for the London, Tayern. oreover, if the
silver soup-tureens—that on the day of the funeral surmounted the
Bar, by tasteful order of the Corporation—could be retained, they would
add greatly to the significance of the erection. The tureens might be
labelled “turtle” or “gravy:” though we are bound to say, they were
not so distinguished on the memorable 18th.

THE LEGAL SEASON.
THE prospects of the season

ſ not very brilliant; and—
\
to use the phraseology of
the Green Room—“the
people won’t come,” how-
ever much may be done
to “pull 'em in” to the
Superior Courts at West-

is in lowering the prices,
in order to compete with
the Minors, or County
Courts, which are doing
“tremendous
business.”

purpose:-
LEGITIMACY AND TALENT : 1
The public are respectfully informed that this magnificent Hall is
now open for the season, with an
UNRIVALLED COMPANY.,
#: will go through their extraordinary performances in Law and
quity.
Among the other astonishing feats that can º be witnessed at
this establishment, the public attention is particularly directed to the
DRIVING OF A COACH AND SIX THROUGH AN ACT of PARLIAMENT ;
a performance that will be repeated at intervals during the season.
n order to give as much, diversity as possible to the Programme,
arrangements have been made for the production of
THE LAST APPEAL.
From the Quarter Sessions, which will be brought forward regardless
of expense. -
The novelty next in succession will be a Conviction, supported by
the most eminent talent, and terminating with a powerful dénouement,
realising, in the conviction,
THE CONWICT'S Doomſ.
The entertainments will be enhanced by the facetiae of MR. BRIEF-
Less, the celebrated Blackstonian Buffo, and MR. DuNUP, the un-
rivalled forensic Grotesque.
Young Barristers trained and broken in from 10 till 4.
The Caledonian omnibus leaves the Temple every morning for the
Hall, which may be reached by steamboat from Chelsea, and by walking
from anywhere.
WESTMINSTER HALL :
The Quart-Bottle Trick made Easy.
We think the CHANCELLOR of THE FxcHEQUER is in a beautiful
condition to perform the above trick, for he has made himself so small
by his late º a French author, that he could get into any
vessel, however little—even a lachrymatory. Perhaps, however, it
would be dangerous to tempt him with the latter, for if he saw any-
Hºmºirs THIERs at the bottom, he would be slipping into it
irectly.
The Staff of Peace.
WITH the greatest pleasure we read in the Times, that, under the
new French Empire,
“The Ex-King or WESTPHALIA will, it is said, be appointed to the office of
Grand Constable.”
France, you see, has understood her want. Louis NApoleon said
the Empire was peace. We rejoice in the prospect of his appointment
of a Grand Constable, who, it is to be hoped, will comprehend the duty
of his grand office—and keep the peace.

From their chief, now first venture to give you your due,
And bestow on the captive their master has freed
All the care they withheld in your hour of need;
You may think, in your joy such a freedom to gain,
It was justice—not policy-loosened your chain,
And ascribe to an earnest desire to atone
For your wrongs what you owe to Ambition alone.
With a zeal keen as thine, in the glorious strife
For Freedom, I perilled my kingdom and life;
And though, in the terrible hour of defeat,
A more generous foe 'twas . fortune to mett,
When he raised me, half dead, from a heap of the slain,
And bade me my sword and my sceptre retain,
And, still more, when my deeds greater praise would extort
From his lips than he gave to the Best in his court,
I felt that he laboured to lessen the shame
Of my total defeat from regard to his fame,
And was willing more praise on the º to shower
Than on those whose tried F. might rival his power.
And if, in young AMMON, the godlike, the grand,
Who was born but to conquer, to charm, to command,
Love of Fame, crafty policy, meanness, and pride,
With his purest emotions were closely allied,
Believe me! far baser the mixture will be
In the cold, selfish despot, who bids you be flee.
He may boast of the mercy extended to you:—
Does he dare pardon those who your arms could subdue
Tardy justice to France's brave foe he extends ;
But when will he learn to be just to her friends?
Does he think, with your freedom, one Prince to have bought
Whose fame may embellish his parvenu Court
Or hopes he—pursuing his uniform plan
Of resembling his Uncle, whenever he can,
As that hero was graciously minded, when crowned,
With some Mameluke captives his throne to surround-
Your assistance at his coronation to gain?
From such close imitation he'd better abstain.
One captive might pass for another, 'tis true;
But the Uncle won his, and the Nephew stole you :
And the soldiers on seeing you there might, perchance,
Murmur, “Where are the chieftains who brought him to France?”
And if you discover how artful, how base
Were ū. means that have raised him to power and place,
I am sure when the courtiers are taking once more
The oaths they have broken so often before:
When their Chief-of their perjuries never ashamed- .
Hears this third, fourth, or fifth (?) Constitution proclaim'd
By the Senate he hires expressly to make it .
To the soldiers he hires, if needful, to break it:
When the priests, with a blasphemous baseness, declare
That the saints have NAPOLEoN's life in their care,
And have sent him expressly Heaven's cause to advance-
To reform, to convert, to evangelize France,
Whose manifold crimes have long needed a rod
(Some kings have been nick-named the “Scourges of God"):
Then, Prince' as you hear the subservient train,
You will long to return to your desert again,
Where an oath is siill sacred, the law still revered,
And the Prince, to the hearts of his people endeared,
Can confide the support of his rights and his throne
To their love, to their truth, to their virtue alone.
The Muse of Maidstone.
The Stable Mind boasts of two great poets—its MANNERs and its
MAIDstone—but the latter, we think, is the poet par ercellence—the
excellence, honourably gained, of mediocrity. e propose that for his

from France, was interesting enough at one, period. What have you

themselves must be burning to rise. -
France. Non-non—the stones, like the Bourbons, have set in
France never to rise any more.

been allowed to wait the chance of picking up what might
be thrown out from the quarter which an “official organ”
usually looks to for patronage. The Herald, having got
hold of the contents of the Royal Speech, has been taken to
task by MR. Forbes MacKenzie—the only recognised
conduit for official eaves-droppings—and the controversy
has suggested the following duet, to be sung by the parties

“Polly Hopkins.”

to the destinies of France! Why was it not my fate to be linked to
your side of the Channel, instead of this?—your side, which is the sid:

not allow yourself to sink, in this way. Depend upon it, theſe are

months?—and have I not been compelled, from day to day, to record
the degradation of my enslaved country? Have I not written with my

my own hands have I done this ever since December, without throwing

England. Well then, if you cannot wait, at least be silent.
France. You bid me to be silent. Why, you know, England, I have
always been a silent agent in the transmission of these repeated
onslaughts on my country's freedom. You cannot say I ever added a
word, or a tear even, of my own, to the narration of the infamies
which have been put, like so many chains, upon France in her slavery,
and which France—I grieve to say it—only too passively endures like

speak out.
England. I don't ste it; for, not having complained before, you have
less right to complain now. The nation that wears its chains of slavery
as proudly as if they were gold ones that had been bought at a
jeweller's in the Palais Royal, should not, if it has any sense of
modesty left, breathe a word of complaint about the weight of them.
France. Monsieur, je vous demande raison f
England. You ask for “raison,” my dear France, and you shall have
it. And the “raison,” in plain English, is this:–“The Individual
who smilingly allows himself to be kicked, and then sits down quiet
under the infliction, gets not the slightest sympathy by making himse
out everywhere to be a martyr. So it is the same with a Nation. If it
likes being kicked by an old pair of jack-boots belonging to Napoleon,
it had better not say a word about it.”
[Rather a stiffish breeze gets up in the Channel, and the rest of the
Submarine Conversation becomes inaudible.
THEATRE ROYAL, WESTMINSTER.
BY OUR 8LASHING CRITIC.
Holding, as we do, that
censure can always be
conveyed, both with em-
hasis and precision, in
anguage of the utmost
temperance, we invariably
abstain from what are
termed hard words, and
we therefore trust that
the blandness of our
phraseology may not be
misinterpreted into com-
promise, when we say,
that the proceedings at
this theatre during the
#. week utterly and
- sgracefully transcend
il, any previous instances
which even this manage-
ment ... has afforded, of
duplicity, audacity, and
incapacity. On the part
of the public, whom it is
º'-- our proud, but some-
- times painful duty to
- protec", we indignantly
protest against the system adopted on these boards.
A new work, which had not been underlined, was suddenly brought
forward on Monday night, as an original production, with MR. Dizzy
as its avowed author. We do not complain of this change of arrange-
ment, because the exigencies of a theatre are variable. Nor need we
refer to the subject of the piece. It was called The Cypress, and was of
a serious character; the sentiment and moral were elevated, and
the language in the highest, degree appropriate and even elegant,
Unexpected as was the production, it gave great satisfaction, and
although, as a general rule, we attach little value to the opinions of
actors, we may mention that, the veteran MR. PALMERston, who was
in the front of the House, and markedly applauding, privately expressed
his conviction that certain portions of the affair bore the stamp of real
genius, though he admitted, subsequently, that the person to whom he
-. |º
º
º
- - 2-
had attributed genius had not stamped, but only put his foot in it. The
press was nearly unanimous, in its applause, and MR. Dizzy was
admitted, by The Cypress, to have retrieved some of his lost laurels.
Will it be believed that this original piece was, in all its good parts, a
mere translation from the French * Yet, such was the case. 3.
Cypress, produced as his own, by MR. Dizzy on Monday night,
is neither more nor lest than a translation of a piece called Gouvion de
St. Cyr, by M.THIERs (a French author, whose plots and intrigues are
poor enough, but whose language is very º: brought out in
1829 at a national theatre in Paris, since suppressed. The detection
of the fraud was, we believe, originally due to certain suddenly revived
recollections by MR. PALMERstoN, who directed the researches of
another actor of great respectability, who, though Young, is, by no
means green, and our contemporary the Globe published the dis-
covery, and referred to a report in our contemporary, the Chronicle,
in which the piece of M. THIERs was described, and, on comparing
the words of the two works, the plagiarism becomes revoltingly obvious.
Such are the feats of the manager of our greatest English theatre! .
We abstain from comment. We have heard that MR. Dizzy designs
to offer some excuse of the most common-place character; to say,
indeed, that he copied M. THIERs' piece into his own common-place
book years ago, forgetting to append the author's name; and on again
referring to the book, thought that the work was his own. If the
public accept this excuse, we are silent. But we are forcibly reminded
of another piece brought out by MR. Dizzy, when the late M.R., PEEL
was manager of the theatre (and which may be no more original than
The (ºpters), wherein the principal character sarcastically addresses his
rival, “You found your enemy bathing; you stole his clothes, and you
wear them as proudly as if they were your own.” . After this, could
the public expect the Semitic manager to steal such very “old clo'”
from a ...? Another rumour which has reached us is, that
MR. Dizzy means to take refuge behind two jokes, and to ; first,
that if his piece was St. Cyr, he was sincere also; and, secondly, that
in treating his subject, he was so affected that he insensibly melted
into THIERs. As regards the first plea, the public must pronounce the
sentence; as regards the second,-though no one who, sees the actor-
author can doubt that he is often affected—we cannot believe a person
can easily melt whose element, out of which he cannot live, is hot
water. e will only add that M. THIERs is about to take proceedings
under the International Copyright Treaty, and that the piece has been
performed on one night only.
On Friday night the house was *: filled to witness a new local
and }.}. extravaganza, called “W. B., or, Did You Ever Send Your
Frail to Derby?” but there was a difficulty in obtaining the licence;
and MR. Cockburn, who was to have played a principal part (Sir Scariſy
Scorch, we believe) very properly announced a, brief postponement.
*:::: is a part of an Irish %. in it, which will probably amuse the
raddle.
With affairs behind the scenes we seldom meddle, but those who
care for such matters may like to know that on Friday, in spite of
some intrigue, a meritorious servant of the public, long known—and we
hope, long to be known—as Old Joe, was installed into the office of
{.. and began his duties that same evening. We trust he will
keep the company to its work, for many members are disgracefully
behind their time, to the disappointment of those whose money goes
into the Treasury.
“Peace and Plenty"—of Noise.
MANY members of the Peace Sºft advocate their cause in such a
noisy manner—agitating away as if they were going to move, heaven
and earth to enforce their pacific principles—that we think it would
only be just to change the name of these Friends of Peace—but not
Quietness—and to them, for the future, “EARTH-QUAKERs.”
A new FORM OF HERO-WORSHIP.
THE robbery committed upon a French author by our CHANGELLOR
or THE ExchEQUER, when he was expatiating on the virtues of
WELLINGTON, was intended after all as a compliment, for DISRAELI
thought he could not pay the memory of the departed hero a greater
honour than by taking something more from the French.
The Pope and the Fine Arts.
We learn from a Modena paper that the Pope has given an order to
the sculptor M. Jacometti for his fine group of “The Kiss of Judas.”
The Pope must, no doubt, feel and deeply *...* the subject. For
what a kiss did Pio NoNo give to Roman liberty—and how he has

“WHEN FRANCE IS SATISFIED, THE WORLD IS
TRANQUIL.”
THUs, in his modesty, spake Louis NAPOLEoN, during his recent
“progress" to the Empire, at Bordeaux. Now, Punch is never
needlessly an alarmist, and would not prematurely frighten any nervous
reader. But a warning like this is not to be neglected; and, as one of
the National Defences of his country, Punch feels it his duty to call
attention to it.
For, if Louis NAPOLEoN speaks the truth (and by accident perhaps
he may), the world is obviously on the brink of War. Its peace is
guaranteed, we are told, so long as “France is satisfied.” A comfort-
able assurance, truly 1 As if France ever could rest “satisfied” for
more than (say) a week together.
Besides, the very word “satisfied ” is, Punch thinks, most ominously
significant, seeing how inseparably it is coupled with what duellists are
apt to call a “hostile meeting.” For the world’s sake, therefore,
Punch would recommend that France be forthwith bound to keep the

Justice for Austria.
ALONE amid the Allied Powers whose battle was fought and won by
our great Duke, Austria refused to send a military representative to his
funeral. The excuse for this disrespect — it is understood—is the
unavenged horsewhipping of HAYNAu; unavenged because HAYNAU
chose to put up with it: would not prosecute the draymen. What the
Government of this country ought to have done, in the opinion of the
Austrian, we presume, is—without regard to HAYNAU's laches—to have
decimated the establishment of MEssas. BARcLAY and PERKINs, and
drowned every tenth man in their biggest vat, reserving all those that
were suspected of being ringleaders to be broken on the wheel.
Panic in the Dramatic Market.
It is reporte that Alexander DUMAs is writing a new piece for
an English Theatre. Upon a member of the Dramatic Authors’ Societ
remonstrating with him upon the unfairness of his writing for the English
stage, and so taking the (French) bread out of the English authors’
mouths, ALEXANDER THE GREAT made this reply—"Mon ami, il n'y a
rien changé. Il n'y a qu'un Français de plus parmi vous.”
THE SOWERE
IGNTY OF THE CITY.
EveRY now and then an occasion happens
when the sº the City
has to be asserted by the tem-
poraryoccupant of the civic throne;
and the day of the Duke's Funera
was one of the occasions alluded
to. The “sovereignty” consists
in a supposed right to shut up
Temple Bar; and, considering the
backwardness of the Corporation
of the City of London in many
important respects, it is perhaps
natural enough that it should
attempt to show its authority by
checking progress. There must,
however, be a traitor to the civic
monarchy somewhere, inasmuch
as the great act of royalty, to be
exercised by the Lond MAYor, is always baffled when the important
moment arrives for the civic crown to use its power. On the day
to which we have alluded, a general officer rode up to the side of
the LoRD MAYon's coach and observed—
“My Lord, the procession will be here in five minutes.”—“Then,”
replied the LoRD MAYor, “let the gates of the City be opened.”
That was all right royal and dignified enough, but, it turned out,
according to the report, that “the gates of the City had never been
shut,” so that the majestic permission to open them was a piece of
mere surplusage. -
We should like to know who is the traitor to the civic sceptre, the
underminer of the mace, who, being entrusted with the keys of office-
the keys of Temple Bar—is so far oblivious of his duties as to allow
the gates to remain open, at the very time when the Mansion House
monarchy is to do the only effective act of sovereignty that is permitted
it. Perhaps Temple Bar won't lock, or the gates don't meet, or the
whole concern is rusty and unhinged, like the Corporation itself; but
certain it is, that when the LoRD MAYoh said “Let the gates be º:

we request any reader of weak nerves to proceed no further with this

The pun isled up to most treacherously by an artful question, “Why

that "HANsand brings to light many things that remain un-Hansard.”
Insult is then added to injury by a note pointing out the similarity

been running about in all directions, to the great consternation
of all residing in his neighbourhood. . His pranks have been prin-
cipally played in kitchens, where he has amused himself by setting
everything afloat, and effecting a series of launches of crockery
and tinware, from the largest potato-steamer down to the smallest
butter-boat. Science tells us that water always finds its level,
but, whatever that level may be, it has been found one day to be lost
the next, for the water in the neighbourhood of London has been
jumping up and down in the most eccentric manner. The meadows
have been converted into navigable rivers; and, had the floods con-
tinued, the cabs and omnibusses must have either had their wheels
taken off, or have had them converted into paddle-wheels, for the
purpose of making their journeys by water through the inundated
thoroughfares. The change would not be very considerable, as many
of the vehicles alluded to are already worked by “screw” power.
Perhaps the rising and falling of the water in the streets may have
affected the omnibusses, and caused that fearful fluctuation in the fares
which has been lately prevalent. So rapidly have these been going up
and down, that the fare from Sloane Street to the Bank has, on some
days, varied as much as the height of the tide, and a passenger, who
has gone to town for threepence, has had to pay a shilling to come
back again. If Father. Thames cannot be made to keep his proper
lace, we may, at least, insist on the omnibusses not only finding their
evel, but being made to adhere to their level after finding it.
A Question to Mr. Smythe.
“SIR,--I lately observed, and pointed out to a friend of mine, a very
beautiful diamond ring in a jeweller's window. He admired the ring.
The ring somehow became circulated in society on the finger of the
editor of The Morning Chronicle. Now I wish to ask of you—as a
casui-t—this little question. Because I pointed out the ring, may I
prig the ring, and flash it as my own P
“Yours, BEN, the YoUNGER.”
“Conscience Money in the Year 1853."
The following will appear in the Times about the middle of January,
a day before or a day after, according to Punch's almanack-maker:—
“The CHANCELLOR of TIIE ExchequER scknowledges of an Ex-
Chancellor of the Exchequer the amount of three quarters’ salary, to
be forwarded as Conscience-money to MEssRs. FoskETT and Chowler,
and by them to be distributed among the most suffering British
farmers.
Hint to a Bird-catcher.
MR. DisrAELI's appeal to the young Members º was made
from a conviction that old birds are not to be caught with chaff; but
he will find that nothing will do for the young ones either, except good
Free Trade Corn.
RAILWAY intelligence.
A New fender has been invented for breaking the force of collisions.
The new fender is said to be a vast improvement upon the old buffer.
UNREADABLE BOOKS.
The marked success which has attended the recently commenced
series of Readable Books has induced an enterprising publisher to
prepare immediately a companion course. Its title will be that which
heads this notice, and we are assured that the works it will comprise
will exclusively be such as shall defy perusal. As a guarantee for this
we need but state, that the gentleman entrusted with the care of their
selection has long been a “Constant Reader” of one of our Protec-
|tiºns: contemporaries, and is therefore fitly qualified to pass his
judgment on the point. - -
#. in itself, the project certainly may seem eccentric, and we
question if, at first thought, many publishers would like to undertake
it. Yet that it will succeed abundantly there can be little doubt, seeing
that it will command the patronage of that extensive class of readers
who are caught by a title as readily as any City heiress; and if Uncle
Tom's Cabin happens to have pleased them, will buy Brother Bob's, or
any other, Crib which the cunning Fº may build upon it.
| We have already, we may add, been favoured with a peep at the
prospectus: a few extracts from which we break no confidence in pub-
lishing. The first work we are promised is that highly interesting
one-
1. The Court Circular: complete from its commencement.
After this, at monthly intervals, we are to have-
2. A revised Edition of Bradshaw: with all the original advertisements.
3. The Inaudible Hansard: being a collection of Parliamentary Speeches, invidiously
reported as “inaudible in the gallery.”
4. Specimens of amateur poetry selected from upwards of 800 Albums.
5. A Collection of Morning Herald “leaders" on the Corn question.
6. Elegant Extracts from the “Visitors' Books,” kept at the hotels chiefly patronised
by tourists. (To be published distinctively as the Fools' Chronicle.)
7. A new Edition of the Rejected Addresses: being those of the Protectionist candi-
dates at the late General Election.
8. “Heavies,” from the pen of a “powerful." Astleian hippodramatist.
fi 9. The wants of the Age: being a Reprint of the Times Supplements for the last
ve years.
10. Colonel Sinthomp's Collected Speeches.
11. Hebrew Melodies. New Series, comprising Specimens from the works of our
best Mosaic “Puff" poets.
12. Correspondence of “A Constant Reader, now first collected, and embracing the
opinions of that writer upon an immense variety of topics. 2050 vols. 4to, at the very
least.
. These few items will suffice to show the scope and character of the
intended, course, and we have little. hesitation, in predicting that
| Unreadable Books will form a series quite as useful (to the butter-man)
as that of their more readable rivals.
The Hustings and the House.
DIsraelſ, in his own bitter way, denounced the idea of “deducing
from electioneering speeches opinions of great statesmen and the
maxims of an English Parliament.” Very right; any fudge may do
for the people out-of-doors, but true philosophy for the Parliament
|assembled. For instance, we will say, for the House of Commons,
nothing meaner than the philosophy of Bacon—whilst for electors,
mere GAMMON.
Abd-el-Kader a Frenchman.
ABD-El-KADER claimed to be allowed to vote for the Empire “as a
Frenchman.” The claim was allowed; and the Emir dropt his paper
in the electoral “urn.” In this instance, how true—how significant
-is the name of the vessel that receives the vote. For the urn that
makes such an Emperor contains the ashes of French freedom.
A Good Customer.
An Irish gentleman, being repeatedly solicited by a wine-merchant
to give him the benefit of his custom, wrote to him to the following
effect:-"My dear Sir, I am not rich enough to pay for wine
myself, but shall be very happy to serve you in any other way. If you
will send me a list of your customers, I will see what I can do to
cultivate their acquaintance.”
MAGISTERIALLY SPEAKING.
Louis NAPOLEoN has been addressed on several occasions as “le
Premier Magistrat.”. If he is the First Magistrate, it puts the nose of
his favourite bird out of joint, for we certainly should have thought the
Eagle was the “Greatest Beak.”
A BAR SINISTER.—We propose that there be engraved on the City
arms a tremendous Bar Sinister, in the shape of that barbarous old
Bar, Temple Bar—and that the Bar Sinister there remain, as a re-
j blot upon the City escutcheon, until the nuisance is
removed.

ENGEANCE.
His LTHough we have heard
# a great deal, during the
last few years, about
dramatic and musical
criticism being dead,
if it is defunct in town,
it certainly is ram-
pant in some parts
of the provinces. The
following extract, from
a Plymouth print will
prove, that if the Lon-
don critics are deficient
in poetical feeling, it is
only because Pegasus
has run away into the
provinces, and has found
a Mazeppa in the shape
of a seaport critic, who
has “urged on his wild
career” with the fol-
lowing piece of flighti-
ness :-
* Plymouth. Theatre. —
When Donizerri's exquisite
conception guided the band
that was bequeathing a mu-
sical legacy to posterity and
its ancestors, surely the spirit of Fame planted its signet on every one of those insig-
nificant-looking, dotted hieroglyphics, and made them immortal. As in the balmy
morning of every returning spring we visit our favourite rose-tree-that tree whose
perfumed beauty lived still in our memory, whilst its material was commingling
beneath the snow with the mould that nourishes the parent shoot, even as we find it
“wasting its sweetness on the desert air, and gratifying the senses with revivified
charms as lovely as heretofore—so the orations of this great master have an undying
freshness, that protracted intervals of estrangement cannot infect or diminish. The
simplicity of the story of La Vivaspirae by no means forms its least attraction, and the
musicis one continued prolongation of happy and delicious melody."
We are afraid that the above piece of superfine writing will be
hardly intelligible, unless it could be accompanied by pictorial illustra;
tions of an appropriate character. There is scope for a fine allegorical
*::::::: in the figure of “FAME planting its signeton those insignificant-
ooking, dotted hieroglyphics,” and the skill of the artist will be shown
in deciding whether there should be a separate signet to each dot.or
whether one signet should cover the whole of the dots—a point which
the critic, who seems to be in his dotage, might have easily settled;
There is a glorious gush of something which is more easily expressed
than understood in the description of the critic himself, “visiting his
favourite rose-tree in the balmy morning of every returning spring;”
and, lest we should have any doubt as to which particular tree he
means, he indicates it expressly as “that tree, whose perfumed, beauty
lived still in our memory, whilst its material was commingling beneath
the snow with the mould that nourishes the parent shoot."
We recommend this tree to the particular notice of DR. LINDLEY,
or some other great botanical authority, who we trust will go down to
Plymouth expressly to purchase it for the Conservatory at Kew, or the
Gardens at Chelsea. The critic is able, it seems, to visit the tree,
though the material, is out of sight, “commingling” beneath the
snow-at Plymouth, by the way, snow is to be met with on a "balmy
morning” in spring—with “the mould” that nourishes the “parent
shoot.” If it is the “parent,” we do not see how it can also be the
“shoot;” but a poetical license, perhaps, accounts for an expression
to which the term “father-child” would be analogous. We leave to
the curious reader the task of examining the other points in this
Plymouth rhapsody, which could only have emanated from a brain full
of those “dotted hieroglyphics” with which it evinces such an extra-
ordinary sympathy.
Parliamentary Language.
THE CHANCELLOR of THE ExchequeB, in his great speech-we use
the word great with reference to length—on the motion of MR. WILLIERs,
made use of the expression “an uninformed sneer.” A sneer being
a physical movement in which the eye, lip, and nose take, a part, we
do not exactly see how the term “uninformed” can be applied to the
rocess. We might as well speak of an “enlightened sneeze” an
ignorant sniff,” an “instructed wink,” or an “uneducated hiccough.”
We dare say the expression, “uninformed sneer,” is all right; but it
sounds odd when placed in juxta-position with the somewhat analogous
terms above cited.
SPORTING IN IRELAND.
Owing, perhaps, to the recent wet weather, there has been during
the last fortnight very little shooting of landlords.
THE DESERTED FARMER.
A BALLAD OF RURAL LIFE.
'Twas on a fine morning in Buckinghamshire,
As I was out shooting by leave of the Squire,
With my gun in my hand, and my dog by my side,
All among the green turmuts a Farmer I’spied.
He groaned and lamented for grief and for woe;
And I axed him what made him bemoan his self so?
Says he, “I’ve lost my true love-shan’t see her no more,
And that is what makes me to cry and to roar.”
“If thee'st lost thy true love,” I then did reply,
Come tell me the means and occasions whereby **
“'Twas a false friend,” he answered, “in whom I did trust,
Which when Iremembers, I be ready to bust.
“I gie un my suffridge and gie un my vote,
Which having obtained, he has now turned his coat;
And unto his care I entrusted the maid
As he has so basely forsook and betrayed.”
“Who’s she, and what’s his name?” I axed him again.
“Oh! she was PROTECTION, and his name is BEN:
But she’s dead and buried as sure as QUEEN ANNE,
All along of that cruel, deceitful young man.”
“If she's dead and buried, 'tis no good to grieve;
And how oft was you warned that there BEN would deceive!
Obliged for to do just as PEEL did afore;
Come,” I says, “blow thy nose, and don’t blubber no more.
“PROTECTION is gone!—let her bones rest in peace;
By most folks' accounts’twas a happy release:
And the best thing for you now Protection is dead,
Is to stick up directly to Science instead.”
"In your words,” says the Farmer, “there’s reason and force;
I'll take your advice, for I likes your discourse:
Whigs and Tories was both rogues alike, Iwell knew,
And I finds 'tis the same with Protectionists too.
"To my crops, and my cattle, and pigs I'll attend,
And endeavour in future to be my own friend;
Meanwhile, though half ruined, I’ll be of good cheer,
So come and partake of a jug of strong beer.”
CASES FOR COMPENSATION.
SIR. J. PARINGTON must pause—(in the House of Commons, be it
understood)-before he admits it to be “just” to benefit even the
working-classes, at the expense of others. SIR.J. P. himself knew
men who had been respectable farmers, now working as day-labourers.
Now, it may be urged by cold-blooded political economy, that all
social improvements must have, their victims...Mr. Punch, for once,
º leave to deny and despise the assumed justice of such assertion;
and, therefore, suggests to the Protection party-for the party lives and
wriggles (even as an eel skinned and cut in pieces may wriggle
in the very pan that fries them)—the following affecting cases for
compensation:- -
John Bags, late a respectable innkeeper, reduced by railways, to
become third waiter. - - - -
SAMUEL CHEEK (now, in his old age), the flourishing driver of the
Brighton coach, now reduced to a spring-eart, , .
Tom Tugg, a waterman, “as held his head high” in the Battersea
Duck, breaking stones "all along” of the penny steamers.
WILLIAM BUTTON, tailor, who—when trade was something like
trade-used to have his five pound for a dress coat (and cheap at the
money), and then could afford his coach and pair, now reduced by
paletots at one pound one, to a º gig.
And lastly, the British Goose, that supplied the free-born Briton's
free, uncensored quill; and is now only thought on for its flesh and
feathers, and all because of iron pens !
Trolling for Jack.
THE Times proposes the formation of a naval militia: a *
force. It is all very well to talk of our wooden walls; but those walls
will be good-for-nothing without Bricks. The Admiralty must bid for
Tars on the principle of competition, and outbid the Merchant-Service
and the Yankees. In other words, they, must fish for Jack with suf-
ficient bait. They can no longer *::::: upon impressment; the days
of the Pressgang are gone by ; and they have now and henceforth only
the Press to resort to, without the Gang.

“The Country Is Awfully Deep, BUT THE FALLING Is DeLightfully Soft AxD SAFE.”
FAIR R O SAM ON D.
AN O L D L E G E N D WITH A N EW AP P L I CAT I O N.
PROLCGUE.
BewildeRED BookeR, let me speak—
. An hour has pass'd away, and more,
Since with a flush upon your cheek
You flung the Times upon the floor.
As in the smoking-room you sat,
I’ve watched you, and remarked how blue
The looks, that from beneath your hat
On men and things around you threw—
And I, too, mused—until at last—
(Helped by a glass of something warm)—
Across my mind a legend past,
And settled into novel form.
And would you have the thought I thought
And hear the tale I have to tell,
Just order up a pint of port,
(Or p'rhaps a bottle were as well)—
And I will tell it. Turn your face,
Nor look with that too serious eye—
For gravity is out of place,
Under the present Ministry.
THE GARDEN.
The greenwood grows around the door
In many a close pleached knot and maze,
The windings of the walks would floor
A Dizzy's skill in crooked ways.
From life without, through leafage dense,
Far sounds come faintly on the wind,
Like the strange voice of common sense,
Slow reaching the bucolic mind.
Quaint in the midst a garden bow, r,
Standing upon its close-pleacht lawn,
Wherein, like to some fragrant flower
Behind the leaſy shield withdrawn,
Fair Rosa Mond, a willing thrall,
Secluded dwells in covert green,
KING HENRY's love—incog, to all,
Particularly to the Queen.
EN Tf:TE A TÉTE
How tell what joys sped time along,
Within the screen of Woodstock Maze —
What petits soupers—sans façon /
What fetes champêtres / what déjetiners /
For Kings that love will doff their state ;
Monarchs are men, with ladyes fair;
Prince Presidents—en tête-à-tête-
Are as they were in Leicester Square.
Thus held KING HAL a pleasant time
Far from Court boredom, state and throng,
In joys, with just that smack of crime
Which makes so pleasant what is wrong.
If e'er amour excuse could screen,
Screen'd royal HAL's amour might be :
His love was fair, and just eighteen,
His queen not fair, and fifty-three.
But Kings to business must attend ;
And so it chanced that war began–
Love's téte-à-têtes must have an end
With monarch as with common man!
He went ; but left to guard his flower
A knight, who kept a silken clue,
Which, fastened to the central tower,
Guided the garden mazes througll.
THE DISAGREEABLE ALTERNATIVE.
I wot not how the hap befell,
But, certes, it befell ere long—
QUEEN ELEANoR found out too well.
That Woodstock way was something wrong.
Perchance she spied her lord, or rat
A key that oped his escritoire-
Enough to say—she smelt a rat,
And so to bane that rat she swore.
The knight was summoned to the gate;
His throat was cut, his clue was ta'en ;
Threading the gardeli mazes, straight .
The Queen the inmost bower did gain–
And there FAIR Rosa MonD she found,
And sternly called her o'er the coals,
And, sorry choice, did straight prºpºund
The knife's quietus, or the bowl's'
How that fair face first flushed to red,
How that flushed face soon changed to pale,
Hath been far better sung and said,
Than I can do.’t—in that old tale.
She died, we know, but what her death,
We know not—if she stabbed or quaffed-
What matters whether that sweet breath
Was stopped by dagger or by draught?

The King returned to find her dead,
And o'er her body reared a tomb,
On which a sea of tears he shed
Weeping his Rosamun DA’s doom.
How he paid off his cruel wife
Legend nor history doth proclaim,
But, no doubt, he led her a life
And she, no doubt, led him the same.
MORAL.
Now, MR. BookER, take my lay,
And if its moral miss your brain,
Just turn again the page and say
If that cut do not make it plain f guide;
You shake your head P Then let me bring,
A meaning to the song I sing,
So hooking it to useful ends.
Was not DisBAELI, many a year,
Sheltered within Protection's gates,
Shut out from sense and reason clear
By prejudice and party-hates?
On him your party hung its fate
Fawned on him, fêted and caressed—
Leaving its loves legitimate,
Its GRANBys, RichMonDs, and the rest.

He doubts, yet doubts not which to face:
The poison of his spoken words–
The knife, that cuts his hold on place'
EPILOGUE.
Now, MR. BookER, read my lay,
And, if you find a meaning there,
Just take it to your heart and say
“What fools, to trust in speeches fair!–
What fools, to leave the simple men
Whose order bound them to our cause,
And trust one of the tribe of BEN-

THEATRE ROYAL, WESTMINSTER.
BY OUR SLASHING CRITIC.
This week has
`--> been signalised
N by the produc-
tion of an impor-
tant novelty, in
three acts, with
the whole ability
and debility of
the establish-
ment included in
the cast. It is
| entitled, Vor Po-
& puli; or T
* Landlord’s Last
Kick, but any
connection be-
tween the titles
and the plot seemed to have been sedulously avoided by consent of all
parties. . We subjoin an outline of the story.
..The piece begins with a scene of our own time, one of happy peasant
life. e hear a chorus of contentment and prosperity, a large white
loaf is said to be on every man's table, his wife, and children are well
clad, and he has work and wages. This pleasant state of things arises
from the presence of Cornucopia, a rich heiress, resident among the
tº. She was, it seems, the adopted daughter of a late philanthropic
aronet, and she has for guardians the Hon. Charles Clarendon and
Mr. West Riding, the former an amiable aristocrat, the latter an eminent
manufacturer. The hand of the heiress is, of course, tºy sought,
and among, the most prominent pretenders to it are Oaks, a
sporting nobleman of dashing, bearing, but not over sincere in his
dealings, and Mr. Israel Plagiary, a showy and audacious M.P. of
Hebrew origin, and possessing all the volubility of his race. These
are the principal characters; and, without º, the ramifications
of the story, it may suffice to say that Qaks and Plagiary, for reasons
of their own, enter into a compact, the nobleman introducing the
rvenu into the highest circles in exchange for the services afforded
y the latter's superior keenness and plausibility. T. have already
victimized a large number of poor stupid farmers, and have pledged
many things not their own to deal with. They are, therefore, most
anxious to secure the celebrated and popular heiress, and agree that
each shall woo her his own way.
The dashing Oaks, whose antecedents have been notorious, avows to
her that he has loved a rival of the young lady, a Miss Monopoly, but
professes that he has, dissolved that liaison, and is as devoted, to
Cornucopia as if she had been his first love. The more audacious but
less frank Israel vows that the moment he knew the heiress he loved
her, and though it appears that Israel used to abuse her adopted father
in the most violent manner, chalking “humbug” on his back of a
night, and alleging that he was only a low huckster, he persists, in
asserting his passion, and even declaring that he had never in all his
life attached himself to another. The girl herself listens to both, but her
heart is quite untouched by either. The scenes of courtship, the attempts
by the suitors to wheedle Clarendon, whose mild but shrewd manner,
and high-bred bearing, oppose themselves to the fervid rattle of Oaks
and the smooth . of Plagiary, and the rage of the baffle
schemers are tolerably brought out, as are their equally vain attempts on
Mr. West Riding, the other guardian, who bluntly tells them they are
cheats. Foiled and furious, they resolve on revenge, and in order to blast
the heiress's character, they get one clumsy country fellow to come for-
ward and assert that she was not the daughter of the late baronet at all,
but an impostor, and is much older than she seems, while another clown

accuses her of having picked his pocket and nearly ruined him. An
eccentric doctor, with a long beard, one Gruntz, tries to terrify her #.
declaring that her brilliancy of complexion is hectic, and that she “wi
not last long; ” and some other accomplices actually hint that she is
“not so wise” as she might be, and advise restraint. The imbroglio
continues for some time; but, of course, the plotters are ultimately
exposed and crushed. Oaks is shewn to have made a private and most
stringent promise of marriage to Miss Monopoly—their union to be clan-
destine, until the advantages of the other connexion are gained: and the
dashing sporting nobleman is rejected; while, as for Israel, he is shown
tº have been for no less than six years trying to get up evidence to oust
Cornucopia from her domains, besides having been convicted of having
plundered a poor Frenchman of his º: and of having practised, a
novel stratagem by which he actually succeeded in robbing a Scotch-
man of an article of value. Their discomfiture is complete, and Cupid
next appears upon the stage (though we confess his intervention was
je as injudicious as possible), and it is found . that...Clarendon, who
has ardently loved Cornucopia for many years, is entitled to the first
place in her affections. The dénouement is most inartificial and objec-
tionable; but it brought down the curtain smoothly on the vindication
of the heiress's noble and beneficent character, of which all the dramatis
personae, except the clodpoles, record their approbation. The piece
was not over until past two on Saturday morning.
We have little space for further remark, and regret it the less that
scarcely any of the characters in the piece had anything original to say
or do, and that the way most of the performers acted was very absurd.
They dragged the piece fearfully, and where they should have been
energetic and crisp were prosy and feeble. And such figures as some
of them presented were perfectly absurd. The veteran WILLIERs, as
Clarendon, was tame at first, but warmed into capital life and vigour;
and distasteful as is the part of Israel Plagiary, we are bound to sa
MR. Dizzy was bold and effective in it. Oaks is constantly heard of,
rather than seen. MR. GRAHAM, in a curious part called Big James,
a canny north country man, was very oily; CoBDEN was less fortu-
nate than usual in West Riding, and obviously regarded the affair as a
farce. MR. PALMERSTON's Cupid is an excrescence on the affair, and
was so felt, but it was graceful enough; and MR. PEEL, in the short
but good part of Frederic (son of the maligned baronet), displayed an
admirable portrait of filial duty and indignation. The authorship of
the º is disputed, but it is not worth cavil, and though it will be
heard of for some time, it will, we think, damage, rather than serve
the Treasury.
A Rival to Sibthorp,
THERE seems to be a probability that what may be termed the “low
comedy” of the House of Commons is likely to be divided; a rival
to the inimitable SIBTHORP having just made his appearance in the
person of MR. BALL. We have seen no particular proofs of humour
manifested as yet by this gentleman; but it is a fact of some significance
that the name of BALL is seldom uttered in the house without its being
followed by “a laugh.” We shall wait with some curiosity to see how
MR. BALL “comes out” during the session, for it will be rather too
hard if the Honourable Members are making an unfair set at him, and
only indulging in a Game at Ball.
Dizzy's “Good-natured Friend.”
great deal of absurd talk”—said a friend of Dizzy's—
“about BEN’s cribbing that speech from THIERs. Poor BEN ' 'Twas
only natural to wish a change of diet. . The fact is, he had eaten, so
many of his own words, that he thought he should relish a few of the
Frenchman’s.”

AND NOW, A WORD ABOUT NELSON.
AND it is true what TENNYson says of NELson-addressing the
Admiral by the way, in his Ode to the Duke It is true?
“Thine island loves thee well, thou famous man;
The greatest sailor, since our world began!"
England loves the memory of Nelson dearly P She ennobled his
; : brother; ºf his clerical beaver with a coronet; and when
e faded from the flesh, laying that clerico-noble flesh beside the dust
conveyed from the bloody cockpit of the Wictory; to be reverently,
devotedly followed—wept over—to St. Paul's; even as we have seen
tho dust of the great Old Duke followed and deplored. The Earl
Parson sleeps—can he sleep?—beside his heroic, ingenuous, unsuspect-
ing brother. There can be no doubt of it; nothing can stir or wake
him there; or NElson would long since have shaken and startled him
thence as though he had been the most craven Frenchman.
Thine island loves thee well, glorious HoRATIo? Let us see.
On the 21st day of October, 1805, on board of the Wictory, “then in
sight of the combined fleets of France and Spain, distant about two
miles”—NELson retired into his cabin and made a codicil to his will.
He left LADY EMMA HAMILtoN-(who had done the most vital services
to England)—a legacy to his king and country. Both king and
country refused the legacy; and after years of misery, dying in the
very fangs of poverty, EMMA HAMILTON passed beyond #. help of
GeoRGE THE THIRD and very merry England. She sleeps in a timber-
aid in Calais; but the Parson Earl—who stung and robbed her—lies
eside his brother.
“I also leave”—writes Nelson, then in sight of the combined fleets-
“to the beneficence of my country, my adopted daughter, HoRATIA
NELson Thompson; and I desire she will use in future the name of
NE1son only. These are the only favours I ask of my king and country,
at this moment when I am going to fight their battle.”
But an hour or so, and a shot from the mizen-top of the Redoutable
makes those favours payable—payable at sight of the slain but vic-
torious admiral. .
. But were they paid?—No: and to this very hour the draughts remain
dishonoured.
This codicil was placed in the hands of brother WILLIAM—then the
PAbson EARL, Nelson; and he—as the Times said in a most eloquent,
withering article—made waste paper of it. But what was to be expected
of the man who, for years previous to Trafalgar, crawled upon his belly
for Church promotion? Mark how he whines to the mistress of
NELºon :-
“Now we have secured the peerage, we have only one thing to ask;
and that is, my promotion in the Church, handsomely and honourably—such
as becomes Nelson's brother and heir-apparent to the title. . No pºt
off with small beggarly stalls. Ma. Appington must be kept steady
to that point. I am sure Nelson is doing everything for him. But
a word is enough for your good sensible heart.” -
But this . sensible heart the Parson Earl flung into the street to
pine and break. At the time Nelson's life streamed out with his blººd
in the cockpit, PAason Nelson, with his wiſe and family, enjoyed, the
hospitality of Lady HAMILTON. The black-coated £ººl-ſhe black
went below the cloth-"quietly kept the codicil,” written it may be
said in his brother's blood, “in his pocket, until the º £120,000
were duly voted” for the NELson º The Earl dined with LApr
HAMILTON that day; and, in the triumph of his baseness, gave her the
codicil, telling her she might do her best with it. She, did. “She
registered it.”—says the Times—“at Doctors' Commons the very next
day;” and there it may be seen upon the payment of one shilling. The
Parson Earl “hid his head in a coronet,” and LADY HAMILTON and
Nelson's child were “let down the wind, to prey at fortune.”
Nevertheless, sings the Court Poet to the outraged hero—nevertheless
—"Thine island loves thee well, thou famous man.”
Why do we again refer to this subject—this scandal to our England?
Because we think the hour and the occasion especially call for justice
to Nelson's daughter; the wife of a clergyman who—unlike PARson
WILLIAM Nelson—has no thoughts of “handsome promotion in the
Church;” but who has nevertheless eight children. HoRAtia Nelson,
the legacy bºgueathed to England, has received—but we give part
of the advertisement appearing in the Times:-
Nº. MEMORIAL FUND.—Provision for the daughter and only
child of Nelson, bequeathed to his country's care on the eve of the victory of
Trafalgar, in 1805–the Trustees of this fund beg to inform the contributors that the
sum collected (including donations from his Royal Highness Paisce, Alarat, the
duke of campaidoº, the Duke of Buccleuch, Earl Nrlson, and other eminent
rsons) amounts to £669 16s. 4d. Of this sum part has been invested in Government
ecurities, and the remainder applied, at the request of Nelson's daughter, in quali-
fying one of her eight children for a civil profession; and in enabling another to avail
himself of a cadetcy kindly given by Carran Shephran, when Chairman ºf the East
India company. A free passage to India is promised to another son, should any
equally generous patron be fouad to offer a similar commission. [And this for the
grandson of NELson 1]
Ought we not as a nation—we who have within these few days
witnessed so full, so solemn, so glorious a homage to the memory of
Wellington—to the dust of the man borne to lie beside the dust of
Nelson, as the most revered, most honoured resting-place-ought we
not to blush to read the above plea in formá pauperiº for something,
the smallest, the very smallest sum in liquidation of the ſº debt—
the great national debt—still due to Nelson as, by his last bequest,
surrendered to his child. --- -
Horatiº Nelson—to the present writing—has received £669 16s. 4d.

m part of her demand. Is it even a farthing in the pound? Con-
scientiously, we think not. -
We have yet the bill to come in for the funeral of the Duke. Will
England grudge the cost, though a large one * No. , Yet we cannot
but wish–(if HoRATIA must still remain unrecognized by the state)—
that some few hundred yards the less of cloth had been hung about
St. Paul's to the loss of Dean and Chapter, so that NELSON's
daughter might have had their value. We scarcely think that even the
shade of the Duke—if shades are conscious of funeral braveries–would
have withheld them.
And now we are to have an architectural, an educational monument
to the Duke. A school is to be erected to his memory; a school
whereat the children of soldiers shall be reared and instructed. A very
noble monument this—glorious to the dead—benevolent to the living.
A golden shower already descends upon the mere thought, of the
institution. May the shower still fall plenteously; but while, in
honour of the memory of WELLINGTON, we succour and educate the
children of soldiers foreign to his blood-let us at least do something
to provide for the eight grandchildren of NElson—children in whose
living temples beats” the current of that blood that flowed through
mortal wound at Trafalgar.
Any way, if acknowledgement must be still withheld, let us for very
decency prohibit, ban the Life of Nelson from the class-books of the
scholars of the WELLINGTON, School. Let them not read how NeLson
with his last words cried through his friend HARDY to his country,
“Never forget HoRATIA l’”—only to learn how doggedly his country
persisted to forget her.
FACTION IN SHOE LANE.
*/ .
THE Morning Herald cries exultingly-
“Ripped up from snout to tail, lies before us
the carcase of the beast Faction l''
How is this? We thought it was not
possible to rip up without a “division?”
And at the time the Herald rejoiced,
nobody had divided. But the Herald
has a prophetic genius. And had de-
termined to have Faction tipped up;
and moreover—as barbers kill calves,
and dress them as bears, with the san-
guinary placard “slaughtered to-day”-
so had the Herald resolved to exhibit the
beast, when ripped up, at the office-door
in Shoe Lane, Mrs. Gamp (in this
wet weather in very high pattens) at-
tending, and with her umbrella. “point-
ing out all the infernals of the beast
as it was ripped up by BENJAMIN's
- knife, which is a iron pen, in HER
MAJESTY's Parlyment, which is the Commons.”
Consolations in Railway Travel.
The mail train from Plymouth having got off the line the other night,
a newspaper paragraph states that the grumbling of the passengers
was converted into conviviality by the appearance of cigars and brandy-
and-water, brought from a neighbouring hotel; ... by which aids, to
hilosophy they were enabled to endure a delay of some considerable
ength. This circumstance may suggest the introduction into an Act
for the Better Regulation of Railways, of a clause obliging every train
to carry spirits and tobacco for, the solacement of *:::: during
any detention; for which the mildest penalty should be the fine of a
glass of grog and unlimited cigars all round.
A THIN HOUSE.
The Irish Brigade will have it all their own way this Session; for,
with the exception of Colon EL SIBThorp, MR. BookER, the MARQUIs

chief parties in the House—the Ministerialists and the Free Traders—
are six of one and half-a-dozen of the other.

are no such monarchs reigning; they are all X-Kings; indeed,

THE EMPIRE OF BEADLEDOM.
THE appeal to the Arcade on the question of the hereditary Beadle-
dom, has been responded to by eight millions of votes, though the
number of electors is less than a hundred, but this only serves to show
the enthusiasm of the people. The votes were collected in an electoral
tea-urn, and the Lascar having asked permission to record his vote, it
was received apart in a breakfast-cup. None of the diplomatic circle
have taken any interest in the election; and, notwithstanding what has
been said by the friends of the Beadledom, we are enabled to contra:
dict positively the absurd rumour that BARON NATHAN had tendered
his vote in an . The Baron has maintained throughout a dig-
nified reserve, shutting himself up in his cloak, and dictating no other
steps but those which he has always prescribed to those—his pupils-
who submit their movements to his guidance.
The marriage of the Beadle is again talked about, and a portrait of
the intended bride has been shown at the Beadle's lodge to a select
circle. The lady is connected collaterally with the Alley of Cranbourne,
and is a daughter of the House of Dunstable. The Tuscan and Leg-
horn interests are said to be §. to the match, but it is probable
that when the Empire of Beadledom is fully established in the person
of BUMBLE II., there may be a change of sentiment.
The coronation will, of course, be the next step, and it is said that
the celebrated Pope—the carrier—will be invited over from Hammer-
smith to carry out the arrangements.
Commerce has been rather dull in the Arcade during the past week,
but orders are now beginning to come in, and several dozens of China
save-alls have been purchased for an hotel in the neighbourhood. . A
slight rise in the price, of bran has checked the dealings in dolls, but
with the approach of the Christmas holidays activity is expected.
BENJAMIN'S ADDRESS TO (PARLIAMENTARY) YOUTH
INGENUous Youth ! to you I will appeal,
Now first among these hard old stagers met;
For ah! your hearts have not forgot to feel,
The Session's humbug has not steeled them yet.
You have not known of subdolous intrigue,
Of thimblerig, or anything like that,
Of factious motion or designing league:
You never knew a partisan to rat.
You have not learned to crack the bitter joke
On men who turn out other than they seemed,
On promises unscrupulously broke,
And pledges scandalously unredeemed.
Yours is the season of undoubting trust,
Such as when vernal sunshine gilds the scene;
Ere yet the ways are parched to dreary dust,
And leaves and herbs and ducks and peas are green.
Oh! lend me, then, your ears, and do not think
That I will e'er abuse the precious loan;
Confide in me, however they may wink,
O'd in the wicked paths of party grown.
Like smiling Hope, and Faith, with lips apart,
That ne'er applies her thumb against her nose,
List to my tale, devoid of specious art,
And don't suspect whatever I propose.
A Diadem for the Emperor.
TRADE has its heart as well as its pocket. Hence, a few Parisian
tradesmen—disinterested admirers of Louis NApoleon-have resolved
to present the new Emperor with, say the papers, “a new diadem
set with diamonds.” May we be allowed to suggest bullets instead?
They would be incomparably cheaper, and at the same time would
more truly illustrate the means by which the Emperor has obtained his
sovereignty. Bullets by all means, subscribed too-(we doubt not
that they might, with due search be found)-from the very hearts of
his people.
An Indefatigable Librarian.
MR. PANIzzi, hearing some gentlemen make allusions to “the Book

British Museum.

THE COMIC CAHILL.
QUR heart bleeds towards poor CAHILL., Certain published letters
of his had misled us into the supposition that he was a raving bigot,
and seditious, truculent incendiary. Alas! we fear that we have done
wrong to our brother. We have now reason for apprehending that
QAHILL, after all, is a member of the confraternity of—cap and bell.
Such at least is but a fair inference from the subjoined jokcs, jocosities,
and allusions, reported in the Tablet as having been uttered by DR.
ÇAHILL in a farewell address, the conclusion to a course of lectures on
“science,” at the Macclesfield Theatre:—
“It had been told to him that during the delivery of his lectures he had been con-
tinually looking up to the gallery. If so, it was because he had been talking of the
Heavens, and why should he not look to the gods? (Laughter and applause.) . . .
They would recollect that he gave them a lecture on mountains, in which he showed
that our valleys were warmer in consequence of their having the direct rays of the sun;
that the atmosphere gradually grew cooler with increasing altitude, and that the
mountains were frozen on the top. On coming to the Preston theatre, he applied this
to the gentlemen present. Those in the pit were very warm in their manifestation of
good feeling towards himself personally; but he must certainly say that the simile
ended, for when he went up to the gallery; he found that in place of being cold, they
had been at boiling point all the time. (Laughter and applause)
When he first came amongst them, he thought he was a stranger; but their first cheer
made him [feel] that he was one of themselves.”
Here we have GAHILL-like any other itinerant, Professor of Merri.
mºnt—making jokes, appealing to the gallery, and confessedly “going
in” for applause. His jokes are of the mildest, to be sure, but then
his end was to amuse—to amuse, perhaps, in order, that he might
subsist. Poor fellow ! We only hope we have not deprived him of
bread by any remarks we may have made on his misinterpreted rant.
This was mere bombast and burlesque, of course. In venting, such
seemingly atrocious language, he was only, as it were, masquerading in
the character of a disaffected and furious political priest. We may not
approve of this mode of holding our opponents up to execration, if that
was CAHILL's object; still we might have given him due credit for
intentions at least good towards us. , For simply º a priestly
firebrand, a man is no more to be blamed than M.B.O. SMITH is for
having played the Devil. We hail the appearance of CAHILL in genuine
motley-instead of the party-coloured vestments of superstition. Why
should he not write for Punch * We repeat our hope that we have not
injured him in his profession—if it is that of a jester... For, instead of
being a malignant Popish parson, the man may really be a worthy
Protestant, jack-pudding, a respectable, mountebank, a meritorious
Merry-Andrew, struggling to get his living by honest buffoonery—for
aught we know, with a wife and six children,

announcing that the “Professor”—who also

-may be consulted on all important subjects of
human destiny.” Some of these he enumerates:
all might rather exceed the limits of his space.
Among them are “Life, Health, Love, Marriage,
Pecuniary Affairs, Sickness, and Emigration.”
Whatever, may be his advice to emigrants, it is
not very likely that he will quit the country
himself—of his own accord—for he knows well
enough that the Australian Diggings are not to

THEATRE ROYAL, WESTMINSTER.
BY OUR SLASHING CRITIC.
º) of the season, the wor
for the appearance of
which the public, tanta-
lized by a long series of
preparatory puffs, had
begun to look with a
sort of interest, actually
came off on Friday night.
It is called The Budget.
The preposterouslength
of the affair must, upon
the present occasion,
its protection, for it oc-
cupied five hours and
ten minutes in the per-
formance. Criticism in
detail in out of the ques-
tion. Nor, indeed, is it
our custom ever to be
severe, and least of all
§. a production which,
whatever we may think
of its merits, has un-
doubtedly given employ-
ment to great numbers
of persons, and has been
placed upon the boards
with no smallexpenditure
of ingenuity and in-
dustry. We are disposed
to let the public voice
decide its fate. The
manifestations of a
wearied house, on Friday
night were so equivocal, that we can hardly accept them as a sentence. . The author,
MR. Dizzy, was re-demanded several times, but, when he appeared, his reception
was not com º We saw, indeed, during the evening, several pieces of
orange peel fall near him, and though we did not observe that any apples were
ung, we remarked in his proximity what looked very much like old crabs—they
may, however, have only been the faces of some dissatisfied supporters of the
management.
The Budget is not a work depending so much upon strong effects, as upon the
elaborate working out of a given idea. Certain figures are taken as types, and,
though automatons, they are subjected to systematic manipulation, which at length
makes them bear an interest to which no Englishman can be insensible. The plot-
if so it may be called (though the real plot had obviously been worked out, before
the affair began)—turns upon the adventures and perplexities of a lady who is a
| landed proprietor, and also a holder of manufactories, Mrs. Britain, . She is a
tolerably kindly old soul, not over wise, but with good instincts, which keep her,
generally speaking, in the right path; but, from hints which are given of her
character, we learn that she is always, being victimised. Any beggarly foreigner,
especially if he pretend to have a title, is sure of her hospitality; but she is
capricious, and sometimes treats her own dependents with harshness. A needle-
woman who comes to make up her dresses is over-worked and ill-paid; and a young
lady, who resides with her to instruct the children, is snubbed, and sent into the
kitchen, in a vulgarly arbitrary manner. In some other matters she is foolishly
obstinate, insisting that all the sinks of her house shall run into a pretty fish-stream
under her best drawing-room window, and that the family kittens shall be drowned
there; so that the water, which might be ornamental, is offensive. There is a pic-
turesque church attached to her mansion, but she spoils its effect by opening a
church-yard in the midst of her kitchens and bed-rooms. A parcel of lawyers are
always hanging about her, and pretending to improve her property, and she has not
the sense to see that they are mere thieves. This is the heroine of The Budget. It
developes nearly a year of her domestic and other vexations. She incurs enormous
expenses; but, properly managed, her estate would bear them, and much retrench-
ment might be made. Each new steward she gets promises wonders. Her last,
one hood—a good-natured fellow, but avowedly ignorant of arithmetic—was got
into her service by some rich relatives of his, named Grey, who seem to have
feathered their nests well, out of Mrs. Britain's property. Her new steward is
of Hebrew descent, and so takes kindly to figures; and, of course, has all sorts of
shifts and dodginesses to try. His name is Benny Diction, and in his own diction,
which is excellent, he announces himself as “a real bleºsing.” His devices to keep
things going, and to make Mrs. Britain believe that her affairs are being splendidly
administered, form the staple of The Budget. He gets her grocer to knock off
fourpence-halfpenny, a pound in her tea, and her maltster to take off sixteen-pence
a bushel in her malt, which they can both well afford to do, as the first has been
cheating her all her life, and as the other has just had some great gains by
means of some law compromises. Then Benny gets some tolls in the neigh-
bourhood taken off, and, some charges for night-lights reduced; and a fellow
in a pilot coat, who bullies her visitors a deal, is handed to the sessions,
sº/
--
and some troublesome quack-salvers, with their salvage
are served the same way. And her household being fond
of toffy, Benny arranges for the treacle and molasses to be
brought into the house, so that it may be made at home;
but he snubs the grocer—who wants a little money on
account, being in difficulties—and tells him if he can't pay
his old workmen, to catch a China-man at a crossing, and
make him work for him. And so Benny makes things look
plausible º: Meantime, he concerts, with the tax-
gatherer, a scheme for getting an enormous sum out of
Mrs. Britain for taxes on her house; and, though he cer-
tainly gets her chaplain, and her amanuensis, and some of
her farm-servants a little relieved from the income-tax, the
old lady herself has to pay rather more than before. And
so, out of the bold and plausible speeches of Benny, the
sneers of his rivals, the helpless indignation of poor old
Mrs. Britain, the counterplots of Wood, the ex-steward
—helped by a sort of small orator, one Russell (with a
tiresome catch phrase, “Jack's alive!”)—and the really
clever things said by a grim old Scotch ex-surgeon (a
capital character), Mac Tottle, a good deal of interest is
created. But the whole affair is frightfully long; and there
is much, in it that must be submited to an unsparin
pruning-knife. The management seemed to feel this, an
it will not be played again until next Friday. We shall
probably notice it again. We will only add that MR. Dizzy
played the principal character; and, though indisposed,
sustained it with the fortitude of an Arias—an atlas,
indeed, in which the great latitude taken was no less
evident than the longitude given without an observation.
W. B., or Did you ever send your Frail to Derby? has
been licensed at last, and read; but Mr. BEREs Ford, who
was to have played the Irish iſofor, was afraid of his part,
and shirked it, despite his pledge to j. it on the
boards of this theatre. But it is being studied tisewhere,
and the public will not lose by the delay.
HOMAGE TO THE INFLEXIBLE.
Here’s to GRANBy and NewDEGATE SIBThorp and BALL,
And the staunch fifty-five; the minority all,
Whom argument never could render untrue,
No rhetoric conquer, no reason subdue.
With facts and with figures though pelted like rain,
Unshaken as posts did those heroes remain,
Statistics upon them were hurled by the foe,
Not an inch they recoiled—for they felt not a blow.
As the goose throws the water-drops off of its back,
Impervious as firm, they repelled each attack,
In genuine proof-armour encased they were hit
To no purpose by proofs; to as little by wit.
Give me those that self-evident majors won't grant,
And your minor deny, notwithstanding they can't,
Or admitting the premises, logic disdain,
And dispute the conclusion they clearly contain.
If the country were ruled by such counsels as theirs,
We should soon see a different state of affairs
The loaf would fast rise, and the people would not,
At least if they did they’d be hanged or be shot.
Or should revolution and ruin ensue,
The hearty old English Protectionist crew
Would remain at their guns, till the old ship went down,
Exclaiming, “Hooray for the Country and Crown'."
Different Vehicles of Government.
The French drive—the English guide. This is best
proved by bringing forward the different vehicles which
have been chosen by the two nations as symbols of their
respective Governments. In France they talk of their
“Char de l'Etat.” In England, we speak of our Wessel
of State. The chariot may be taken as expressive of the
way in which the French drive matters upon land; and the
vessel, we think we may, without much vanity, assume as
figurative of the manner in which the English guide the
course of events at sea.

CHICORY AND CHICANERY.
WE have most of us heard of the traditional old joke said to circu-
late in cheap eating-houses, as to the propriety of having the flies on a
separate plate, when “one of currant pie” is ordered in the dog-days,
by some hungry dog who is having his day, and indulging in a three-

line between that article and chicory, by desiring to have them separate.

CHAPTER II.
“Bluter Castle, near Knockintulloch, Bligmurdochshire.
“THE famous town of Drumsleekielies upon a river, flowing towards
the sea—like Florence. It is always delightful to me, as a Scotchman
to notice these remarkable cases of resemblance. I suppose you will
hardly deny that Florence is beautiful? The inference is obvious, and
I am delighted, Punch, to have you there!

It will be found that the adulteration will far outweigh the genuine
article; and indeed we might suggest “Magna est chicory et prevalebit,”
as an appropriate motto to be placed over almost any London
coffee-shop. If the regulation against mixing chicory with coffee is to
be enforced, there should be a new scale of weights for the use of the
grocers, as it is quite impossible that a pound of unchicoried coffee
can weigh above four ounces, if the profits of it are to be the same as
they have been hitherto. Wine Measure has long been exempted from
the ordinary rules of homest measurement; and we suppose that
Coffee Measure must henceforth have a set of weights of its own, by
which a pound of coffee may bear about the same proportion to a
pound of anything else, as a quart bottle of wine is found to bear to a
quart of any other liquid.
Brotection Gone to the Dogs.
THE CHANCELLOR or THE ExchequER has long been an advocate
for a good political cry. As the Protectionists, from LoRD DERBY
down to MR. CHRISToPHER, have, it appears, made up their minds to
“bow ’’ to the country, Punch recommends them to adopt for their
new cry, “Bow, wow, wow !”
“PICTUREs safeLY REMOVED.”

nothing of the original picture left: -

it is said, that the last time he was seen—he was reposing with, both

and DALZELL was killed. By the bye, the coachman, I believe, was
killed too; but you may depend upon it, that if the Laird was killed,
nobody bestowed much attention on the question of what became of
the coachman.
“The Eaglesham gives you a very good breakfast; in fact, it's the
best inn, perhaps, in Drumsleekie. The county gentry mostly put up

over the way, they boast an historical association. For there the Pre:

of the people of Drumsleekie, but I dare say they wished the departure
of the rebel army from other—not quite so romantic-feelings. It is
on record, also, that the Prince carried off the Provost; which is more
than any invader, I think, would be found to do, now-a-days. But,
these are quieter and more happy times.
“The general aspect of Drumsleekie is picturesque-with its red sand-
stone churches, and streets paven with white round stones... The High
Street is even majestic in its appearance. I may be prejudiced, but I
say majestic.” The stranger who comes from London to stay in a
provincial town, feels a sensation like that which he feels in London
—when he gets into an omnibus. He feels that he has suddenly
emerged from his absolute solitude, and become an object of observa-
tion. But, further than that, he has an odd sensation from the contrast
between his romantic notion of the place, historically, and the place
itself. For example, who does not know, that 'twas in Drumsleekie
that BRUCE slew the 'RED Comyn Why, there's a great family proud to
this day, that their ancestor ‘finished' him on the occasion, by walking
in and giving him the final stab. At least, they derive their crest and
motto from the deed and word then performed and uttered. If you
were to ask at Drumsleekie to be shown the pºt you would, doubtless,
be told, “Just by Dick BREEks, the tailor's I' Breeks lives and does
his necessary trade-work, there (we require him in the South-so none
of your old jokes, Mr. Punch !). You feel a little put out that every-
y doesn't feel as you do when you go there. But this is an every:
day matter to them: BRUce slew the RED CoMYN on that spot—and
'twas there Dick BREEKs made the “bailie's' Sunday trousers.
"Apropos of trousers, I must not omit to register a ‘note' on something

in 1706 • * * * : * The Scotchman in his own country is a better
fellow than the Scotchman in London. In London, I have remarked, he
is shy of his fellow until he knows a good deal about him. He is even
known to doubt your Scotchmanship for a little. You may be an
interloper; a mere pretender to the honour. “From Dundee?” he
asks drily, as much as to say, ‘you’ll hardly be claiming thaut!”
"Farther south,' you perhaps observe. "Ah!’ And then you cannot,
if you are a RAMsay or a MURRAY, be one of the RAMsays or the
Murrays. A Scotchman in London is slow to believe another Scotch-
man anybody. SIR. Isaac NEWToN, who was of a Scotch family,t
wrote, I have heard, to claim kindred with the head of his house; who
took no notice of him, conceiving him to be a stranger who wanted to
connect himself impertinently with NFwton of that Ilk. But this is
a digression. I say the Scotchman is a far better fellow at home. If
he is your kinsman, so much the better. By Jove, we’re a sentimental
people, in spite of what they say about our hardness! Do you know
that Sir Walter Scott shed tears when he saw the Scotch firs in the
Apennines? I, myself, displayed the deepest emotion at Cephalonia

BALgony give me the run of his pheasants, though I am a bungler

abuse it. I have heard my father (who grew ten times fonder of the

GoRDoN of Haig stayed once with GoRDoN of GRINSMUIR so remorse-
lessly, that they were obliged to serve him up his spurs, in a side-
dish. This, however, was an extreme case. We never did even a thing
like this. At the entertainment which followed the funeral of Black
M'SPLeuchan, my great grandfather, scarce a man in the parish (of
rank sufficient to be invited) was sober.
“Two days after my arrival at Drumsleekie came Sunday. ...I was
sorry to observe how disputes have divided our church...Besides the
Established Church, there is the United Secession, and the Brotherly

way of snubbing Presbyterianism, and pooh-poohing the Scottish

So I think, altogether, just give me fine weather,
And no rivals my plans for to frustrate
And-it ain't no use talking-be’t a “ riding ” or “walking,”
I'll turn out a job you'll call fust-rate.
Why, 'twas but tºother day, didn't we stow away
One, for whom some professed great affection—
Her age it might be somewhere near thirty-three,
You know her I mean—Miss PROTECTION.

Six hundred or more must have been round the door–
No wonder my men was quite flurried.

One GRANBy and BALL was chief mourners,
With old MRs. GAMP-as quite wept herself damp—
Many joined 'eld, but slipt off round corners,
Some few, by their crying, seemed to feel for her dying ;
Old servants—they always most suffers—
About fifty-three their whole bilin’ might be,
Steady, elderly, top-booted buffers.
As for us who “performid,” why in course we was warmed—
(One wants spirits on these sad occasions,)
But quite stiff and steady, with faces already
Made up to suit grave situations:
And nought could be graver than was our behaviour—
Few'd have thought to see such solemn creepers,
That 'neath long cloaks and scarfs was such lots o' good larfs,
And such fun dressed in hat-bands and weepers.
To see men misbehave, on their way to the grave,
Friends don't like—and it's they finds the stumpy—
As I says to my men, "When you goes back again,
You may sky-lark—till then come it grumpy.”
Well, we stowed her away, and I think I may say
Chaps me'er had a pleasanter ride, Sir,
Than me and my men, as we came back again
On the stripped hearse—all cosy outside, Sir.
Black clothes and sad looks we’d scored all in our books—
Glasses round at each public I stood, Sir;
The party was laid up, our bill to be paid up-

“MR. PUNCH,
“A sensIBLE writer in the Times, signing himself VIATOR,
comba's the assention of revenue officials, that it is impossible to levy
an ad valorem duty on French wines. Your readers, Sir, do not require
to be convinced, that to facilitate the importation of those beverages
is a thing most desirable by all manner of persons, except brewers and
teetotallers-desirable even by the latter as conducive, at least, to
temperance. It is obvious that the introduction of the juice of the
ſº must tend to prevent the interchange of grape-shot; the more
ttles we crack with the French, the fewer heads we shall break; and
the greater quantity of claret that flows commercially, the less amount
will be drawn, pugnaciously, between us. A nation of wine merchants
might as well cut their own throats as those down which their produce
is poured by their customers; they would be pledged to, peace in the
wine:glass. Light wines, moreover, are salubrious as well as pleasant;
by their cheap admission, therefore, we should not only lessen the
chances of hostile invasion, but also diminish the frequency of bilious
attacks. Increased consumption would compensate for reduced duty;
thus, we should gain security without losing revenue, and be enabled
to dispense with militia-men and blue pills; all by the agreeable and
satisfactory expedient of addicting ourselves to good and cheap wine.
To these beneficial results an ad valorem duty would tend; and were
there any difficulty to be apprehended in collecting it, I am quite sure
the means for surmounting that obstacle might be supplied by an
Establishment. in Fleet Street, commanding taste competent to appre-
ciate any quality of wine. I beg to forward my card to your office,
Mr. Punch; and with the assurance that I have the nicest palate in

or other wine, to subscribe myself, hereinunder,

too true, the sanctity of
Royal matrimony was
wont to be profaned by
the conjunction of prince and princess irrespectively of their affections.

Nor will our Court, adorned now at last with the domestic graces, a
pattern to its subjects, ever show them one so different as to mortify
those virtues at the root. The idea of the PRINcess Royal, aged 12,
being engaged to be married is too absurd. Seriously, however, we

and respectable single gentleman, desirous of fº married tº, &
respectable lady, no matter her age, possessing a handsome fortune.
On cross-examination, MR. PELLAs stated that
“He had never before speculated in marriage. He was under 30 years of age. He
did not care about his wife's age, as he wanted a companion in a woman, and mouey
might give her favour.”
However, this not very particular gentleman was, in fact, aforeigner.
He was above 12 years of age, though under 30. He was old enough
to understand the value of his own heart; and was a free agent in the
negotiation for its sale. In all which respects, the Augsburg Allgemeine
Zeitung will perceive, he differs entirely from the PRINcess Royal.

A PRETTY PLACE AT TUNBRIDGE WELLS
We have been asked what we think of the advertisement subjoined,
which appeared, lately, in the Times:-
WANTER, in a tradesman's family (a widower, with three girls, the youngest
nine), an active, cheerful, domesticated PERSON, who understands the French
language, has a good knowledge of music, and is a good dressmaker, and would
not object to housework, which is light. Washing, &c. all put out. As the person
will be treated as one of the family, a small salary only will be given. No other
servant kept. Address, with full particulars, stating age and salary required, to
G. M., Grove Hill, Tunbridge Wells.
After sixty seconds' mature deliberation, our opinion is that this -
announcement has been put forth for a bet. We conjecture that G. M.,
in a moment of eccentricity, laid a wager to the effect that such desti-
tution exists among Governesses, that he would obtain an answer from
at least one 3. lady of that class, to an offer of a situation so
monstrous and insulting as the above. He must be a bold man to have
laid a bet which not only existing facilities for emigration, but chances
of obtaining a maid-of-all-work's place in any respectable family, render
so hazardous. We should also say he was a rather unfeeling person,
to sport thus with the distress of poor young ladies, if we did not con:
sider that his intention might be to surprise the starving applicant
with a generous proposal—perhaps that of becoming the mother of his
children.
If we are wrong in these surmises, we can only suppose that business
being very slack at Tunbridge Wells, the tradesmen of that town have
got up the foregoing advertisement, for the purpose of ºf an
influx of visitors to see the remarkable beast that may be viewed, on
application, in the shape of G. M., at Grove Hill.

CURATES
|N OLD CLOTHES.
HE cry of Old Clo' is commonly
supposed to be a shibboleth; a
form of speech peculiar to the
Jews. This voice, however, of
Hebrew persuasion has, it
seems, become a Christian ap-
eal. Old Clothes are cried-
in a whisper—about our holy
places—if the areas and side-
doors of our Episcopacy and
Pluracy are holy. Thus saith
S. G. 6. :-
“will the public believe the fact?—
for years past there has been a Society
whose aim is to collect cast-off apparel
for—poor curates!”
The lublic will readily be:
lieve the fact; it will, indeed,
help them to understend how
curates can live on such sala-
ries as those quoted in the
Times by “An INDIGNANT
Church MAN,”, as offered, on
the part of a clerical agent in
the Ecclesiastical Gazette :-
“York, £50, with apartments; Win-
chester, É40, furnished house; Chi-
chester, £52, furnished house; Oxford,
£50, furnished house; Oxford, £50;
Litchfield, £52, furnished house; Ro-
chester, e6), £50; Peterborough, £50,
£25, £60; Ely, £45; Hereford, £40;
Sarum, £30, furnished house and ser-
vant; Norwich, £65, £60, £50."
The Indignant Churchman has previously observed that the same
Ecclesiastical Gazette announces the appointment, by the ARCHBishop
of CANTERBURY, of the “Honourable and Very Reverend G. PELLEw,
D.D., DEAN or Norwich,” to the rectory of Great Chart, Kent,
valued in the Clergy List at £668 per annum; this dean having, since
the year of grace 1829, held the rectory of St. Dionis Backchurch,
London, appraised at £439 a year.
The Honourable and Very Rich—we beg his pardon, Very Reverend
—l)EAN of Norwich, is doubtless—he can afford to be—a bandsome
contributor to the Clerical Old Clothes Bag: a contributor of cassceks
but little patched, and of coats and gaiters not extremely threadbare.
The Bishop of LoNDon, we trust, often stuffs it with habits of charity,
old, but not outworn. The Bishop of Exeter's suits go, probably,
rather to fill the blue bag of his lawyer.
Some interesting speculations are suggested by the idea of poor
parsons wearing the old clothes of rich. Does the Society above-
mentioned sometimes buy the old clothes of the original wearer, and
does it ever get “dome” by a bishop or a dean º: a farthing into
a waistcoat pocket? . Into how many surplices for an attenuated curate
would one surplice of a bloated pluralist cut up? How many highlows
might a working clergyman get made out of episcopal jack-boots?
And how would such a labouring son of the Church walk in the shoes
of a lazy prebend ?
There was an extraordinary man who professed to be gifted with
insight into the spiritual world, and who publish'd his experiences, or
imaginations, of its phenomena. According to him, it is one of the
laws of that kingdom that he who puts on another's clothesis forthwith
inspired and actuated with that other's sentiments; a churchman ald
a politician—if we rightly remember-dispute; are made to change
garments: when forthwith the political man talks as the ecclesiastic,
and the latter utters the ideas of his secular antagonist. This notion
is based on some extent of truth. There is wisdom, in the wig. The
soldier, in a measure, is made by his uniform. Who would not feel
himself to be some inches of a king, in a crown and rºyal robes?
Would you, not be conscious of an inclination to strut, if you were
bedizened like a beadle? To enter into the feelings of a mechanical
working-man, you not being one, would you not be helped by donning
a brown paper cap and an apron f
Suppose, then, one of our lean curates—quoted at from £25 in the
Narrow Lane Erpress, or Ecclesiastical Gazette, inducted into the
femoralia, or nether canonicals, of a prelate; in short, putting on a
bishop's breeches—how would he feel? That the breeches would have
to be taken considerably in for one thing, perhaps. But he might also
be, conscious of a decreasing humility. He might begin to think
a little better than Small, Beer of himself, and to form, a sell
estimate rather at the rate of Old Port. It is likely that his
º: would exceed bread and cheese; some suggestions of sirloin,
if not of yenison and turtle, might be communicated to his interior by
those “shorts” which had formed the outermost continent of so many
good dinners. He might even be sensible of vague indistinct emotions
originating from achievements of French cookery; remotely inspired,
too, by Lafitte and Chateau-Margaux, Sillery, or Johannisberger.
The superinduced breeches of the Lord Bishop would surely com-
municate to him a somewhat enlarged apprehension of good things
and good living.
Whether, on the other hand, the prelatical nether garments would
imbue our poor Curate with any thought of moral famine and †.
destitution, arising from want of working clergy, depending on deficiency
of provision for their maintenance, chargeable on superabundant endow-
ment of sees, may be a question. It is not very *:::: that they would:
the mitre itself puts any such anxiety into few h . . More probably
the breeches would impart a sense of ease and comfort, tending to
subdue and quiet misgivings of that sor'. . But this pleasant impression
would hardly last, by reason of the altered state of the pockets.
As second-hand clothes are better for poor Curates than none at all
it is to be hoped that the prelates and pluralists do not, in general, sell
their cast-off raiment, to the Hebrews. Still, new clothes are pre-
ferable to old for gentlemen and scholars, and to supersede the Society
for providing Curates with the latter, the Heads of the Church might
form an Association for getting them the former. Attired in the
rejected habiliments of the “dignified clergy” the poor Curates appear
in an aspect so undignified as to be absolutely disgraceful—to their
superiors.
Just the Size for it !
As DisrAELI has no longer any use for his favourite Quart Bottle-
for he certainly has abandoned that trick, though he may have made up
for his loss by acquiring one or two fresh ones—may we be allowed to
recommend his keeping the Bottle for some future purpose, or experi-
ment " It may come in useful to hold I.ORD MAIDStone's Deluge
that we are promised after the DERby Ministry has been swept away.
There would be plenty of room for it, and would bottle it up nicely,

“May Good Digestion Wait, &c.”
In reply to a question put to him in the House of Commons on
Thursday night, the Home Secretary said that the Government did not
intend to propose that the whole of the law should be digested. We
are not surprised at this, for how is it possible to digest that which
nobody is able to swallow *

THEATRE ROYAL, WESTMINSTER.
BY OUR SLASHING CRITIC.
HE entertainments this, week
have been of a slight and
desultory character, the ma-
nagement being, we presume,
glad to “put up” anything
they could get, while the great
novelty, The Budget, was being
rendered more fit for the boards
than on its ill-advised produc-
tion. We looked in for a short
time at the second per'ormance
of this affair on Friday, last,
but could see no great im-
provement, except that... the
part of the ex-steward, Hood,
came “up” a little. His ad.

counts, as he, Wood, had often
sent in an account wrongly

smartness of Dandy Tom, a
light character, by no means
new to the stage, but always
welcome, imparted a motion
to the business. We also
thought we listened to some
sentiments for which the
author of the Lady of Lyons is
responsible: and the applause
- they received was by no means
meant for the successful
plagiarist who is understood to have concocted the Budget. -
On Monday a succession of shortextravaganzas occupied the evening;

lent, and we may add, thoroughly English. It is full of fire; and we
have no hesitation in saying that it can triumphantly compete with any
French work of similar construction. Although not a “Whig piece,
the author has not dispensed with the old conventional powder, and
has judiciously prepared the way for keeping the audience in a trº-
mendous roar. MR STAFFORI played the principal character with
much spirit.
The same evening an actor named CARTER, nearly new to the stage,
made his appearance in the disagreeable character of Cavil, in 4
Nation's Tears. We have seen many instances of outrageous violence
on the part of an audience, but we never remember so dead a set being
made against any actor as was directed against this unfortunate
CARTER, . He had scarcely uttered a sentence, when yells and groans
were discharged at him in volleys, and every time he attempted to be
heard, they were re-doubled. He gesticulated furiously, but in vain;
and it was only on a portion of the audience insisting, either that the
performances should ; heard, or that the curtain should fall, that, he
was allowed to proceed. The words he had to utter were certainly a
mixture of nonsense and bad taste, nor is his hard, unpleasant manner
calculated to win upon a fastidious assembly—but we cannot, approve
of these extreme demonstrations, as an indifferent actor will always
find his level in due time.
The long talked-of W. B., or Did you ever Send your Frail to Derby?
has been in rehearsal all the week, but in one of the green-rooms, not
upon the stage, the principal actor, it is said, being afraid, of the
“traps,” and having a nervous antipathy to face the lights, when, he
can avoid it. A great mystery has been made about the affair, but
lobby-loungers say that the plot is pretty clear, and that some letters
which are read will produce a startling effect. There is a good
y—“My name's MR. MoRean, I don't live at Chester,” and
one of the scenes is the interior of a London club; an Irish
Major is seated on a sofa, and is engaged in some mysterious
correspondence, when somebody crosses the room, and is mistaken
by the Irishman for the Editor of a London paper, who, he

the press, º the best friend to real merit, bespeaks a timidity
which augurs ill for W. B.
On Thursday we had the old comedy of the West Indian, supported
rather ably, MR, Wilson was very jovial in the character of Mr.
Molasses, who insists on reviewing the forces of the whole of the islands
and swears that they are the most powerful and valiant fellows extant,
and MR.PAKINGTON was good in Sugarloaf, who is always wailing,
and sees nothing in sunshine but a reminder that shade must follow.
Altogether the performance was a legitimate one, though from the
thinness and coldness of the House, it is not probable that we shall
hear much more of the West Indian.
We hear that the Christmas Pantomime is to be called Harlequin
House-Tar, or the Semitic Juggler and the Decidedly Disenchanted Island.
AQUATIC INTELLIGENCE.
... Lord MAIDSToxe'sÖğ. seems really to have been realised, for
if the letters of “Our Own Correspondents” may be accepted as letters
of credit, there has been a continual deluge throughout the country,
almost ever since the EARL OF DER BY came from it. “Water, water,
everywhere ! ” has been generally the cry. The barometer for months
has been standing at “much wet; ” and while the rains have been
falling, the rivers have of course been rising, and the “meeting of the
waters” has been commonly attended with most inconvenient results.
In the lower districts especially, the tidings have been seriously high,
and many an act of bankruptcy has been in consequence committed.
Not the oldest playgoer ever remembers such a run of “overflowing
houses.” Nine in ten have seemed invaded by the hydropathic system;
for sheets, have been watered after being aired, and almost every
room has had a bath in it. Nervous folks have even slept with life
preservers on ; for, instead of waking in one's own bed, it has been no
uncommon thing to find oneself in that of the adjacent river. In short,
people have been living quite amphibious existences, and many have
found reason to wish themselves in France, where the water, it is well
known, is invariably l’eas.
We have no wish to speak lightly of this really heavy wet; but it
cannot be denied that things are going on most swimmingly.

LORD FRANKFORT IN PRISON GRAY.
LORD FRANKFORT has been sentenced to a year's retirement in the H
House of Correction for a gross case of slander: a case pre-eminently
infamous. , His Lordship—the º: tell us—has undergone the usual
discipline, having been made a K.C.B.--or Knight of the Cold Bath
(fields)-and been dressed in prison attire. . Is the poor man in his
right wits?. We would wish to think otherwise. Nevertheless, he has
been judged and sentenced as a self-accountable man; and therefore,
why to imprisonment was not added “labour?”. We would not
rigidly insist upon “hard” labour; because even that, comparatively
i. to a man accustomed to toil, would be crushing to a man
wholly unused to muscular exertion. Still, we would have set
his lordship , down...to pick a little oakum—the softest oakum
if you will, but still oakum. And whereas the cups carved and
engrayed by poor BARON TRENck were much sought for, and purchased
at a large *:: in token of his memory and his misfortunes—so,
the fine and very fine yarn, picked by a Lord, might have been
bought up by the soft-hearted or the curious (or both), and—like Berlin
wool-worked into kettle-holders to be vended at Fancy Fairs in aid of
penitential evil-doers. Kettle-holders would carry a significance: inas.
much as they mutely preach the danger of getting #. water.
The Isle of Conscience.
THE contemplated extension of the Income Tax to Ireland is a

treating Paddy as Paddy wonld like to be treated, like a gentleman of

as stated by himself. No doubt the Irish Income Tax Returns under
the various schedules will be worderful for accuracy, of course.

THE LADY'S COMPANION.
“BIRDs of a feather,” we are told, “flock together;” and, when an
old lady-bird seeks for a "companion” with the capacities of a cook,
but without the independence of that useful menial, we may presume
that the “lady” thinks herself suited to the sort of association she has
chosen. An action which, like many other legal actions, seems not
very creditable to one at least of the parties concerned, has been
brought against the widow ºf a late judge by a lady who was engaged
by the judicial relict as a “companion” at home and abroad, at the
noble salary of “fifty pounds periannum, out of which she was to pay
her own travelling expenses.” The duties of the companion were to
read out loud, look after the servants, and occasionally to make-if it
could be done cheap—“a pretty little foreign pudding.” The “lady”
who required these qualities in a “companion,” would seem to have
a sympathy with culinary pursuits, and to have secured the congenial
luxury of kitchen associations by hiring the companionship of one
endowed with a cook’s accomplishments, and to whom the wages of a
menial were acceptable. -
Objecting, however, to an unceremonious dismissal, the “hireling”
brings an action for a quarter's pay, which is defended on the plea that a
“lady's companion” being only a servant, is entitled only to her
month's wages or month's warning, like her fellow-servants, the cook,
the footman, and the housemaid. This view of the case is coincided in
by the judge, who decides that she can claim her month's wages and no
more, thus establishing by law what has long been clear enough in fact,
that a “lady's companion ” is to be classed with the occupants of the
kitchen. This being the case, we scarcely see the necessity for
engaging any one expressly to fill the situation, as the lady in want of a
“companion” has only to ask the cookup into the drawing-room—when
her work is done—for the benefit of her society...The †. widow,
who defended the action, and the judge who tried it, are evidently quite
agri ed in their view of the law, and we therefore take it, as certain,
that the judicial fiat has gone forth, fixing the position of a lady's com-
panion on the same scale as that of the commonest menial.
MRS. GAMP CALLED IN.
THE Herald says, upon the opposition to the Budget, "The attempts
at agitation will be only in the nature of angry local pustules, developed
by the irritation of a few demagogues; but the constitution is sound,
and its pulse continues steady and strong.” - -
The above, be it understood is, in other words, the * of Mrs.
Gamp, lowered to the apprehension of the readers of the Morning
erald. We are, however, enabled to give, in its very words, the
opinion of that femme sage and sage femme, called in to attend the
Cabinet during its Budget.
(OPINION OF MRs. SAIREY GAMP.)
“A good deal o' fidgets which in course is nothing which comes in
rash breakins out in Marrowbone and Lambeth, which is low meighbour-
hoods, always inflicted with measles, which as the Chancellor of the
Chequers as as had 'em can be of no hurt sumever to that blessed Caw-
casion. A more sweeter Budget never blessed the eyes of MR. BULL,
which has his quiver full on 'em. The interestin pasint is much better
than anybody ever could have expected. With a tongue like any rose,
and a pulse like the everlastin motion, a threatenin to go for ever.
“Shoe Lane. (Signed) SAIREY GAMP.”
The Two Premiers.
LoRD JoHN RUSSELL, in his late speech at Leeds, eulogised
Mechanics’ Institutions. He said, “I had the pleasure of assisting
DR. BIRKBECK in the beginning of these institutions.” “And I”-
LoRD DERBy might with truth observe—"And I had the pleasure of
offering Doctor BIRKBeck's, widow a £50 pension.” “Which I,”
MRs. BIRKBEck might clench, by continuing—“Which I, with a curtsey
to chivalry, begged leave to decline.”

BAKER Street Bazaar has, during the last week, presented a most
formidable rival to MADAME TUssaud's wax, in the shape, or rather
the shapelessness of agricultural fat and tallow. We were particularly
interested by the asthmatic aspect of a Suffolk short-horn, in a state
bordering on suffocation. The poor brute returned our sympathising
glance with a look of almost breathless interest. The jiàº. gaze the
obese creature assumed might have melted a heart of s one, even though
the heart was encased in a stone or two of suet. We felt the tear drip
from our eye at the contemplation of so much future dripping. We
could not help thinking of the fate that awaited the numerous prize
sheep around us, but we could not say with the philosopher “Out,
brief candle,” for there were several pounds of prospective candles in
every doomed mutton.
There was in one part of the 13azaar a melancholy group of pigs,
over whom we actually let fall compassion's pearly tear, for on this
occasion we considered the casting of pearls before swine allowable.
From an aged sow there came upon our ear a plaintive grunt, with all
the mournfulness of a moaning sou-wester. We returned home with
an imagination full of fat, a mind bewildered by wool, and a vague
idea that the times are not likely to be “out of joint” during the
approaching Christmas.
- - -
The Weather and the Militia.
THE late wet weather has grievously embarrassed the agriculturists
and the militia; the state of the ground, in the cases of both, having
been most unfavourable for drilling. The evolutions of the men have
for the most part, presented the appearance of an aquatic tournament;
and instead of the goose-step on terra firma, the gallant fellows have,
in many instances, been obliged to resort to the species of march which
is practised by that bird in walking the waters.
CUPS OF COMFORT.
In proposing to reduce the Malt Duty, the ChancELLOR OF THE
Exchequek is said to have 'offered a boon to the Protectionists; but
his abatement of the tea duty will be perhaps considered the greater
blessing by the generality of old women.
A SPIRITUAL RAPPER.—We should say that the “Mantle of
GRIMALDI" was quite a spiritual wrapper.
WEST FOR THE WERSATILE.
The pilgrim of the Strand will have observed the word “Wersatio,”
glittering with gold letters in a tailor's window. “Wersatio” is
described by advertisement as a “Reversible Coat;” and we are further
informed that
“The importance of this invention consists in the novelty of the material and its
application—viz., the double purpose of forming two in one without trouble; one side
presenting a gentlemanly morning coat, the other a riding, shooting, or hunting coat,
in any texture or colour desired.”
Is not this just the sort of coat for Ministers? We hope our friend
in the Strand will instantly receive an order from Downing Street for
reversible coats. One side of the Ministerial garment might present an
agricultural gentlemanly coat, and the other a Free Trade or Manches-
ter Wrapper. The word “Wersatio” is objectionable, as it signifies
merely a turning, not the coat or thing turned. A better name may
be suggested. There is a dance called the CHANCELLOR OF THE
ExchrøUER's Polka. Why not style this vestment the CHANCELLOR
of the Exchequen's Polka Jacket f The Right Honourable gentle:
man might dance Sir Roger de Coverley in it, with one side out, and
º: jump Jim Crow and bow to the decision of the country with the
other.
Better Luck this Time.
THE French have re-established the Empire, termed by our contem-
poraries the Imperial Dynasty, but which we call the Empirical form
of Government. We hope the second experiment will succeed better
than the first did.
WERY BITTER BEER,
Avery greatly increased consumption of bitter ale will be the conse:
quence of the reduction of the Malt Tax; for all the beer we drink will
be embittered by the reflection that we are saddled, in consequence,
with an additional House-duty.
Question on the Budget.
It is even said that the diminution of the Malt Tax will not cheapen
beer at all. Well; perhaps so. Possibly the brewers could tell you
that malt has less to do with beer than you suppose.

Political Horsemanship.
THE Times the other day commended MR. DisBAELI for the clever
way in which he had been “riding the country party” lately. We
think the word “riding” is significantly chosen, seeing how obviously

“There is little doubt now, that recourse must be had to the ballot in this county,

THE young blood of Cheshire seems rather of a milky nature, as it
requires so much pressing to render it anything like the cheese.
Bitters.
WHAT makes bitter beer more bitter?—asks Punch.
The CHANCELLOR OF THE ExCHEQUER, an authority on the subject,
makes answer and says-“Bitter small bottles.” And smitten with
the truth of this, Punch's cry is—"Not men, but measures,”
A VERY SOLEMN QUESTION.
* WHAT have I done?”
This is a tremendous query: a question besetting every Rian, woman;
and child, at almost every step and turn of life. “What have I done?”
What a question for a man to put to himself, wakeful and restless, in
the solitude of midnight ...?
Last week, the EARL of DERBy—his system gently stimulated by
the LoRD MAYOR's roast and boiled—last week, the EARL or DERby
asked this question of all the world; yes of all the world: for gentle-
men of the press were there who would cause the query of the noble
|and chivalrous EARL to reverberate round about the world; and who
was satisfactorily to make answer to it?
The noble Earl, for the second time, touched upon the moral dignity
of the masses at the DUKE's funeral. The innocent, unsophisticated-
we do not like to say, ignorant—Earl knew, it seems, so little of the
people of England—(of the few millions who pay taxes, and drink beer
when they can get it, and smoke coarse tobacco, and crack one an-
other's skulls at quarter-staff, and bait bulls and draw badgers, and shy
down Shrovetide cocks, and drown witches, and so forth, even as at
the time of the early STANLEYs)—the Earl, it seems, knew so
little of the rude and savage people, that, when he left his house
on the 18 h of November, it must have been to him as º
he was departing upon a very serious foreign discovery. As he
passed through Temple Bar he must have become a little re-assured.
But about Charing Cross and entering the Strand, he must bave
expected that the people—the mob—the hoggish multitude—would
have received the car with “hurrahs,” and catcalls. That only for
the soldiery, they would precipitate themselves upon the mourning
coaches, stripping them of their velvet draperies and escutcheons. No
MUNGo PARK, no CAPTAIN Cook could ever have been more surprised
and delighted at the pacific demeanour of savages whom the travellers
expected to find cannibals: and lo! they were not men-eaters, but
yam-eaters! Even so was it with the masses—the walls of men and
women—that skirted the streets; and stood like patience in a gutter
on the memorable 18th. The EARL of DeRBY's head shrunk in its
coronet, like a mouldy nut in its shell, in self-reproach. Hear, however
what—full of bashfulness and a little turtle, of humility and a drop of
champagne-hear the EARL OF DERby discourse concerning the people
on that day."
“It is with feelings of self-humiliation that I ask myself, ‘What
have I done that I should hold so high a place among such a people?”
“What have I done for my place?” asks DERBY.
... What have I done?” inquires DisBAELI. .
“What have I done?” the while covered with blushes, stammers
MALMs BURY.
Let the EARL or DERBy take good heart—he has done a good deal.
Men “do not (did not) hold so high a place among such a people”
-even when men were exalted above the mob in the pillory—without
doing a good deal for it. Now, it is a hard truth—but, to some states-
men, what is place but the pillory? True it is that so exalted, they
may for the present have nothing but the sweets of salary and office
showered upon them; but time presses, and hard-hearted history will
spare not her ancient eggs. . But what has DERBy done to stand so
high P Why, for more than six years he talked and voted black, that,
at the seventh, he might accept the black for white. . It is chivalrous
sport to destroy an opponent, only to possess and fight with his
weapons.
“But what have I done?” asks MR. DISRAELI. Why, wonders,
You have jumped from the attorney's stool—(and a noble jump too, if
taken with a strong heart and a high object)—right upon the shoulders
of the aristocracy. You are to an Earl, what Jocko who has seen the
world is to the dromedary Jocko is perched upon. Your tricks are
numberless. ...You can crack epigrams like nuts, and fling the shells in
the eyes of the folks surrounding. You can jabber about guns and
soldiers, and marines and mortars, as much at home with them as any
monkey, born and dwelling on the Rock of Gibraltar—but then, you
must first empty a Frenchman's ink-horn into your stomach, like a dry
Pºp. needing something to be poured in ere you begin to spout.
‘What have I done?” asks the CHANGELIOR of THE ExchequER.
And how all true men of pen-and-ink would have rejoiced to clap their
hands, and cry “Bravely, my beautiful—my BEN ' "
“What have I done?” cries MALMSBURY. Well, you have made
a first-rate bow to the EMPEROR of Austria. If John BULL had
been a ºil." you could not have bowed longer and lower.
You have swallowed Tuscan tyranny as though Tuscan tyranny had
been Neapolitan macaroni. You have showered roses of speech upon
NAPOLEoN THE THIRD and BuBGLAR THE GREAT; as though, the
aforesaid NAP, the III. and B. the G. had been the Imperial Beauty of
the time, instead of that other thing with which in fairy tale at this
writing—(was there ever such a Land of Flam as France?)—the Beauty
is companioned. With MALMSBURY for Foreign Minister, John BULL
has grimaced and shrugged like a French dancing-master—and BRI-
TANNLA talked slip-slop to tyrants like any waiting-maid.

OUR STARS AND GARTERS
It is now become so common for Dukes
and so forth to lecture at Mechanics' Insti-
tutions (we very much applaud the custom),
that it is expected, by way of an equitable
arrangement, a few lecturers by profession
will be called to the Upper House. If a
Duke takes a lecturer's chair, why may not
the lecturer rest himself for awhile in the
| Duke's seat?
| Many new noble lecturers are about to
hold forth—and upon novel and excellent
themes; no other than the history, political
and social, of their own armorial bearings.

shortly deliver a lecture at Derby. (The
lecture will be gratis; or, no doubt FRAIL-

BELLS UPON MY MIND.
AIR-" Bells upon the Wind.”
THAT tinkling voice, that tinkling voice,
Which rings above my head,
In accents jingling on my ears
With tone I’ve learned to dread.
Those madd’ning sounds, those madd’ning sounds
Above, below, behind,
Are quite enough to drive me wild
With bells upon my mind.
Those hateful tones, those hateful tones,
From morn till night I hear;
At morn they summon boots and shoes,
At noon and night 'tis beer.
The barass'd boots, the harass'd boots,
No peace can hope to find,
While he is troubled day and night
With bells upon the mind.
THE FLOODS AND THE FARMERS.
WE see º the papers that the farmers have, in many places, suffered
most severely from the recent inundations. “Great loss of property”
is the general report, and in the low lands, especially, there have been
high grounds for it. There has, moreover, been a complete bouleverse-
ment of the usual routine of farming: and the “four course shift” seems,
in many districts, to have been completely shifted. But little seed has
yet been sown, for there has been but little land left dry enough to sow
it in. And sheep-washing has commenced considerably before its time.
Several flocks, we hear, have been already washed clean—away; hurried,
like defrauding publicans, to their watery bier.
It is not often we can sympathise with our almost stereotypically
“distressed” agriculturis's. Their frequent cries of “Wolf!” have
somewhat steeled our heart against them. But the present is a case of
really “real distress,” and as such we offer our sincere condolence.
Such excessive wetting must, for a time, have damped their prospects.
Still, we trust they will be able to keep their heads above water.
Odd Fellows in Parliament.
A New lodge of Odd Fellows has lately been established under the
name of the Derby Election Committee. The members of this secret
society have been holding their meetings during the past week with
closed doors. Their mystical emblem is the Rose; under which flower,

EDUCATION TRADE REPORT.
The Governess market continues flat. There is a limited demand
for full-grown. Church-of-Englands, with character and accomplish-
ments. Some inquiry is made for music and Freuch; but the tone of
it is low; and the terms offered for the former article resolve them-
selves into barter, being a mere song. In some cases, indeed, sales are
attempted to be negotiated for no money at all, or at least for notes
which no bank could cash, or by a system of acceptances drawn on
paper “qually worthless. in proof Uf the accuracy of these remarks,
we subjoin an advertisement from the Times, containing the most
extraordinary tenders, and purporting to be issued by a House at
Liverpool:—
W ANTED, as JUNIOR GOVERNESS, in a school of the first respectability,
near Liverpool, a young lady, a member of the Church of England, not under 20
years of age, who has acquired the French language in France, end speaks it with a
good accent. She must also be competent to superint-nd piano practice, to lead a
|singing class, and to assist in the usual routine of a school-room. No salary given, but
lessons in music and drawing from eminent professor-, together with laundress, and
travelling expenses paid. If the young lady can converse fluently in German, a further
|* would be given. The strictest inquiry will be made as to character.
| Apply by letter, post paid, to Beta, Messrs. Deighton and Laughton's, booksellers,
Church Street, Liverpool.
Considering the general business in ladies' maids, the steadiness in
housekeepers, and the high quotations of good plain cooks, many
persons are of opinion that the ridiculously low prices offered for Gover-
|nesses are merely nominal, and published by designing parties on a
bear speculation in order to beat down the market; but whether
genuine or fictitious, such shameful proposals deserve the severest
reprobation. We incline to think the above announcement a hoax, on
account of the allusion to the laundress, whose functious would of
course be entirely unknown in a concern so dirty as the Liverpool
establishment.

THE RIWAL PATRIOTS.
A FEw evenings ago there seemed a probability that a most in-
teresting match was about to come off between Messrs. HUME and
GEORGE HUDson, in the House of Commons. The contest was one
of liberality, and though the veteran HumE is liberal ;"º. a
§. sense, we fear he might have been beaten by the Railway
illionaire in the competition they were nearly entering on. The
affair arose out of the cost of the DUKE's funeral, into which MR.
HuME was inquiring rather closely, when he was snubbed by the Ex-
Railway King, who was asked by the economist if he was ready to
draw a check for the amount in question. This was certainly a home
question; but the answer was equally in point—for MR. HUDson
expressed his readiness to put down any sum that MR. HuMs was
willing to contribute. “The matter here dropped,”—to use the Par-
liamentary phrase—for neither of the honourable gents seemed eager to
drop any money. We should be glad to see a
up among members of the House, as to who shall sacrifice most to ease
the public of a burden. It would save a great deal of difficulty to
the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER, if in the event of his desiring
to take off an obnoxious tax, the members would begin to draw checks
against each other, and run a race of liberality for the purpose of
making up an expected deficiency. It is to be regretted that Messrs.
HUDson and HUME did not proceed in their generous rivalry, and go
on drawing checks one against the other, until the affair had ended in
a check mate or a drawn battle.
NUGGET-HUNTERS AT HOME.
THE Morning Post says that an interesting lecture was delivered the
other night at the Young Men's Christian Association, Exeter Hall,
by the Honour ABLE AND REVEREND Montague WILLIERs. From
our º report, it appears that the excellent lecturer, after
very briefly dwelling on the diggings, proceeded to a series of digs.
He represented the lawyer, the merchant, the shopkeeper, the stock-
jobber, the gambler, the *. keeper and frequenter, all as
contributing to form the class of gold-seekers. Under the same head
he also enumerated members of the liberal professions; and in speaking
of these we hope he did not forget to mention the wealthy pluralists,
whose profession certainly is liberal, enough, and whose pay is much
more than sufficiently liberal, although their liberality may be confined
to their pay and their profession.

THE INCOME TAX ELUCIDATED.
In An EASY Lesson.
THE In-come Tax is a fun-my Thing. It is a Tax up-on a Man's
In-come. A Man's In-come is all the Mo-ney he gets in one Year.
Many a Man has no-thing else in the World, than the Mo-ney he gets
in one Year. He pays In-come Tax on all that Mo-ney. He pays
Se-yen Pence out of every Pound of it. Mo-ney is Pro-per-ty. If
a Man has No-thing else than the Mo-ney he gets in one Year, that
Mo-ney is all his Pro-per-ty. So, if he pays In-come Tax up-on it, he
pays a Tax on all the Pro-per-ty he has got. But ma-ny. Men have a
§. deal more Pro-per-ty than the Mo-ney they get in one Year.
ome have Twen-ty Times as much º as that. Yet they only
pay a Tax on the Mo-ney they get in one Year. They pay no more
than Se-ven Pence out of ev-ery Pound of that Mo-ney. They do not
y a Far-thing out of all their o-ther Pounds. So, the In-come Tax
is a Tax on all one Man's Pro-per-ty_and on on-ly Part of a-no-ther's.
MR. GLAD-stone says this is just. If MR. GLAD-stone had no-thing
but what he could earn, he would not be so well off as he is now.
And yet he might have to pay Se-ven Pence out of ev-e-ry Pound he
was worth. , MR. GLAD-stone would not be glad then... He would be
Sor-ry. I do not think he would call the In-come Tax just, a-ny
longer; do you?
HARD WORK AT THE FONT.
The Grand Inquisitor—we beg his pardon, the GRAND DUKE, or
Tuscany—has received an addition to his domestic happiness, after
having deprived the MADIAI of theirs. In other words, he has been
blessed with a son. According to the Paris, correspondent of the
Times, he has christened the young hopeful of Persecution and
Popery—
“Giovanni Nrpomuceno MARIA ANNUNziATA Giuseppe Giovan BATTISTA FRR-
DINANDo BALDAsseae Luigi Gonzaga PIETRo Aless ANDno ZANobi Astoninol"
By a private communication from Florence, we learn that when this
polyonymous infant was baptized, his ſº in naming him, had to
stop three several times to fetch breath; and at the completion of his
arduous task, proved to be so exhausted, that he was obliged, to have
some brandy-and-water. The officiating P. in repeating, the spon;
sorial catalogue was evidently winded, and perspired copiously, but did
not faint, which was considered by the bystanders to be a miracle.

ALARMING INUNDATION.
(From Our Own Reporter.)
T is our painful duty
| to acquaint the Uni-
verse that an inunda-
tion of a most alarming
nature has occurred,
which at one time
threatened to involve
a greater loss than
any which the recent
floods have hitherto
effected. When we
inform our readers—
we mean, of course,
the Universe — that
the safety of the Punch
premises has been
E most seriously endan-
gered, the truth of our
assertion will at once,
we think, be manifest.
Merely premising that
Our Own Reporter is
a rather nervous man,
we proceed at once to put his notes verbatim into circulation. The first we received
was headed thus:
“ Under the bed-clothes—halfpast four, a.m.—I am aroused at this unpleasant
hour by the sudden entrance of “our Boy,” who informs me in a hurried manner that
‘there’s suthun up!’. Without waiting to hear what, I pencil this to show you
that he found me ready at my (bed) post.”
“Two minutes later.—I have º my breakfast and the boy, who in
º; asks me somewhat cautiously, if I’m a ‘swimmer... Gathering from his
hints that it's an Inundation I am sent to, I improvise a life-belt with some oil-
skin umbrella-cases, and putting on my overalls and patent aqua-scutum, I sally
down our alley º to the flood l (P.S. As I cannot swim a stroke, it may
be as well to remind you that I have bequeathed a widow and six orphans to
your care.)
==
- * sº - º --
An interval, of more than half-an-hour here elapsed. The next despatch we
received was almost hieroglyphical—apparently from excitement.
“On the way—I stop to say that I’ve been hoaxed by that inf- well, inferior
little scamp. The Inundation's WALKER!!!
“Sir minutes and a half later.—No, it isn't. The imp spoke figuratively. The
City is inundated—but not in an aquatic sense. As far as I can see there is a
perfect sea of heads, and fresh streams of people are continually pouring in.
“Quarter to.—I am carried by a current into Fleet Street, and take refuge on a
friendly lamp-post. The sea I spoke of surges fiercely round me. I tremble, but
I'll not desert my Post.
“On the strike.—My position is becoming painful. (The lamp-post is a rather
hard one.)
-- fiv-A small newspaper boy has suddenly disappeared in a wave of the
crowd.
“Struck—He rises on the kerbstone at my fee", and informs me, confi-
dentially, that “all's serene.”
“Half a second later.—At present all is wrapped in mystery.

We are able to unwrap it through another source. It appears that some malignant
scoundrel, wagering to out-hoax the Berners Street affair, had maliciously contrived
to circulate the report that upon the morning we allude to our Almanack would be
published. Well, knowing the attraction of this great national event, the scoundrel
naturally chose it for his purpose; and of course the “Alarming Inundation” we
have chronicled was the perfectly obvious and inevitable result.

Theatrical Intelligence.
ONE of the pieces latcly playing at the Lyceum has been
suppressed, we understand, by our vigilant Lord Chamber-
lain, for a political reason which will at once be obvious.
It was feared, in short, that it might hurt the feelings of
our friends across the Channel, by the rather sarcastic
reference, to their late re-establishment of the Empire,
which is borne so pointedly in its title—“Anything for a
Change.”

CURIOUS PROPHECY FULFILLED.
-S- RoM the Mémoires d’Outre Tombe,

the following prophecy:-
“There have always been two Bosa-
PARTEs: one great, the other little.”
When we consider that this
was said long before the present
Emperor appeared on the stage
of French politics, the pro-
phecy with regard to the “NA-

enough to deserve a passing

MR. PUNCH's YULE LOG ;
OR, GLIMPSES OF THE PAST AND PRESENT.
*T was the Midwinter Night,
And the stars, in their flight
O'er the office of Punch, in the court of St. Bride,
That enchanter could spy
In his garret on high,
With Toby, the faithful, asleep at his side.
O'er the chimney, pourtrayed
By his skill, were displayed
A group of his very best figures of speech,
And two vases appeared
On the mantelpiece reared
With the flow’rs of his rhetoric blooming in each.
All around were the spells,
And the charms, which he sells
'Gainst Blue devils, bad spirits, deceit and delusion;
And of others, whose use is
'Gainst tºº abuses,
Jn the shelves, chairs, and floor lay a mighty profusion:
Here the models in wax
Of impostors and quacks
At the fire of his wit were fast melting away;
There, the cause to advance
Of true freedom in France,
He had pierced with sharp jokes a NAPOLEoN of clay;
The Yule Log, that blazed
On the fire upraised,
On an oak of Dodona had formerly grown,
From out of whose hollow
. Trunk, Zeus or APOLLo,
To their questioners Sibylline leaves had oft blown;
But, when all these poor oaks
|Had succumbed to the strokes
Of sceptics, whose axing precluded reply,
The Log I have named
From the fire reclaimed
By a cabinet-maker, came forth by and bye,
Fresh with gilding and paint,
In the form of a saint,
And worked every day some miraculous cure,
Till the English White Friars—
Of relics great buyers—
Sent their agent an image so blest to procure.
It boots not to tell
How, when evil befell
All the Convents, it suffered a terrible drop,
And became, first a sign
For a dealer in wine,
Then a Black Boy outside a tobacconist's shop,
Or how in each place,
Its miraculous face
For its masters oft made many customers stop;
Till, much battered about,
Tarnished, chipped, and worn out,
As no one could tell to what purpose to turn it,
Mr. Punch had just §. it
. . For an old song, and brought it
To his home, in the hope as a Yule Log to burn it.
And e'en now as he gazed
On the Log as it blazed,
He saw that the flames from its fingers and toes,
And the eddies of smoke,
That incessantly broke. -
From its thrice blessed eyes and its sanctified nose,
As over the ceiling -
And walls they went stealing
And dancing, and glancing in light and in shade,
In the forms of Dwarfs, Pixies,
Trolls, Boggarts, and Nixies,
Pucks, Brownies, and Kelpies themselves had arrayed,
And the Lubbar Fiends cried,
“When all faith in us died, .
And our mission as Brownies and Bargeists was over,
or a time ’twas our fate,
In the Church and the State,
On fat sinecure places to live on in clover;
Then, like DAwson and MooRE,
Still increasing our store
Or like Richard and GeoRGEY, those two pretty men,”
Doing less for the pay
We received, every day,
We devoured more livings than three score and ten;
But the press, which alas !
Brought our downfall to pass
As spirits, is bent on our ruin once more.”—
owled a Leprechaun, “Wirrasthrew
Blessed Kevin' What shall I do?
When my quare shape, that bothered the Irish before,
Lost its power to alarm,
Still the peaceful to harm,
As a Ribbonman, Orangeman, Peep-o'-day Boy,
Rockite, Rapparee, Whitefoot,
With quick hand and light foot,
I contrived the whole country to vex and annoy;
But, with great consternation,
I see emigration
Bids fair soon to throw me quite out of employ.”—
Said a Troll, “When our pains,
In the forging of chains -
For the weak, and the knights who defended their cause,
navailing became,
Changing calling and name,
We were able to frame such bills, statutes, and laws,
As to check for a season
Truth, justice, and reason;
But this business don't promise much longer to answer, I
Have great reason to fear,
From the tidings I hear -
Of the New County Courts, and late Orders in Chancery.”-
An elf moanod, “When we found,
For our halls underground,
Little children as servants no more might be caught,
In the forms of slave-dealers,
Slave owners, slave-stealers,
Great skill to our new occupation we brought;
And contrived, for a time,
Every species of crime
To indulge in, but now of all friends quite bereaved,
rom “Uncle Tom's Cabin,”
A terrible stab in
Our tenderest point we have lately received.”—
Shrieked a Kelpie, “My scream
From the fountain or stream
Frightened those who had sought it to bathe or to drink,
And I’ve laboured since then,
Round the dwellings of men
To collect every sort of filth, nuisance, and stink,
But alas ! this Commission
To mend the condition
Of Towns (here the poor fellow looked quite dejected),
Makes me tremble with fright,
When I read, day and night,
Of the drains they have made, and the baths they've erected.”
Here arose a mixed howling,
And general growlin
The Bogles, lamenting each old institution
hose ruins they haunted,
Its excellence vaunted:
While the Banshees foreboded its near dissolution,
Toby, roused by a spark,
umping up with a bark
To bay at the spectres he saw had begun;
When a sharp voice, that broke
From the Yule Log, thus spoke:
“By your friends, Mr. Punch, all this ill has been doue;
* The Reverend Brothers PRETTYMAx pluralists par excellence,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
And our ruin, I know,
To thy efforts we owe,
Thou dread Demogorgon of humour and fun!”—
“ Unfortunate idoll”
Cried Punch; “Learn to bridle
Your wrath, and be civil; for though it is true
Little ruth to each foe
Of true progress I show;
*Tis their minds, not their bodies, I strive to subdue;
And the weapons I use
To convince and amuse
Are so nicely constructed, it oft comes to pass
That my foes haven't half
Made their minds up to laugh,
Or to cry, when I give them the last coup de grace.”
Here the Log one last splutter
Just managed to utter,
But Punch was unable to catch what he said;
So he tenderly raised
#. fire till it blazed
All around him; remained till the last spark had fled;
With one pull at the bowl
Fairly drained off the whole,
Paited Toby, and went off to JUDY and bed.
THEATRE ROYAL, WESTMINSTER
BY OUR SLASHING CRITIC.
THE presence of interest and the absence of principle have alike
characterised the performances at this, theatre, during the past week.
It is, we believe, matter of notoriety that public indignation has com-
pelled the managers, MessRs. DILLY AND DIzzy, to surrender the
direction of the establishment. We have little P. in registering
occurrences which have been justly described by one of the leading
actors as “discreditable,” but we will briefly advert to the extraordi-
scene of Thursday.
W. mentioned that upon the new and "great” work, The Budget,
the managers of the theatre had staked its fortunes... We recorded the
production of this vaunted affair, its cold reception, its withdrawal, and
its subsequent reproduction. The directors, driven to desperation,
resolved to run the piece, and, accordingly, it was “put up” for three
nights successively...The final verdict of the town was thus boldly
claimed, and the pit being nightly crowded to witness the last efforts
of this provincial company, “town,” may be said, and, indeed, was said,
to have been “pitted against country.” . We felt it our duty to attend
each night, but not caring to owe anything to the courtesy of the house
we placed ourselves in the gallery, a locality with which no fault could
be found, except that certain ladies, who are admitted, to the neigh-
bourhood, interfere with the effect of the programme by their chattering
and laughing, and unhesitating remarks upon the personnel of the
actors.
Monday's performance went of flatly, owing to the bal masqué at
JULLIEN's, for since DB, REID has been let loose, it is not wonderful
that people prefer dominoes to draughts. The only noticeable thing
was the termination to the first act, which has been.“ written up.”
and contains a mock eulogy, by Solomon Serious (WALPOLE), on his
friend Benny. This was really comic, and being interarded with Latin
scraps, ludicrously misapplied, excited great, and legitimate mirth. A
hrase in which Solomon, thinking he is complimenting Benny, describes
É. as being continually snubbed and kicked by his superiors (conten-
dere nobilitate, &c.) will be as stock a joke as any of those of Dr. Pangloss,
L.L.D. and A.S.S. - -
On Tuesday the house was better, and the piece went with some
spirit, though there was a manifest desire to get through it as quickly as
ssible. MR. GRAHAM, as the Hon. Boa Constrictor, delivered his earlier
its with great oiliness, and when he had his unlucky antagonist com-
pletely in his power, the coup de grace was given very crushingly... We
wish GRAHAM would get rid of his north-country accent, his broad “a”
is objectionable in a character of refinement. This evening PAKINGTON
came out pretty well as Sir Quarter Sessions, which is about what he is
fit for, and the class of part for which he has obtained a provincial
celebrity.
Włady there was a morning performance, for the benefit of
the Irish, Lunatic Association, and its charitable character, exempts
it from criticism. Indeed, NAPier, for his “double shuffle,” danced on
an Irish newspaper, deserved notice, and he received it—in fact, notice
to quit.
#. Thursday brought the eventful night. The managers again
thrust The Budget before the public, and the latter was, finally aroused
into stern, but most just indignation. ... The exceeding and utter
badness and immorality of the piece, now that the actors were all well
up in their parts, was startlingly manifest. The sentiments inculcated
were felt to be shocking. Many of these, with the hope of smartening
the affair, had been introduced since the first night. Benny, for
example, had to say, “O, promise to pay a shilling, and so get what you
want; but say afterwards that you meant tenpence, or twopence, or what
you like-let's have a little resolution—we're not bound by any-
thing.”. This honourable proposition excited much disgust. A robbery
too, which, by way of a joke, is attempted on some old ladies who have
been to the Bank for their dividends, was lustily condemned, as was a
burglarious incident, in which the hero tries to get some money out of
a little house belonging to a poor clerk, who had already assisted the
reckless spendthrift. We are bound to say, however, that the acting
could not have been better. M.R. Dizzy, the author-actor, put forth
his whole strength, and in one scene, where, standing motionless by a
large table, his head on one side, and his eyes gleaming with hate, he
slowly enunciated bitter sarcasms against the ex-steward Wood, and
then suddenly turning upon him, with a thunder scowl, burst into a
fierce denunciation of his “insolence,” the effect (well or ill placed may
be a question) was terrific, and the house rang with applause for several
minutes. . But no acting could save The Budget, now revealed in all its
naked deformity, and the house became obviously antagonistic to the
acting. GLADSTONE, as Sir Oxford Lºgic, had an effective scene towards
the close, but what he said was felt to tell with damaging mischievous-
ness against the piece itself; and at last, at the end ºf the longest
night's performance we hope ever to witness, the audience rose
en masse, and made in the lobbies, and in the house itself, so tremendous
a demonstration of disgust, that MR. Dizzy, feeling that The Budget
was condemned, announced that it was withdrawn, a declaration which
gave the heartiest satisfaction. He and his partners have since
resigned the management. We shall take another opportunity of
commenting upon the season thus closed, heartily congratulating the
public that a career of reckless audacity and disregard of the tastes and
requirements of the day has been thus brought to a termination.
CONTROWERSY FOR CHRISTMAS.
ACKNowLEDGING, and raving at, the “immense success” of the
Protestant Missions in Connaught and Kerry, the Nation indignantly
exclaims:-
“Shall the soupers and tract distributors accomplish the work which all the force of
England, for 300 years, has been unable to effect?”
Theological controversies, at these particular holidays, are considered
to be, in general, out of season; but there is one species of polemical
argument which certainly is at present º appropriate. It is the
sort of logic which so dreadfully offends the Nation newspaper, whilst
it is so satisfactory to the Irish nation; demonstration to the stomach.
It seems to be very convincing—and no wonder. Feeding the hungry
is no bad method on the part of any Christian denomination to recom-
mend itself. Those who have first tried your soup and found it good,
will have considerable reason for trying your doctrine afterwards. It
would, indeed, be a capital thing, especially just now, if all our “per-
suasions” that are trying to persuade, one another, were to attempt
their object by “becoming soupers,” or dispensers of soup to the
indigent. By the adoption of this course, indeed, a sect would pecu-
liarly deserve the name of “persuasion,” as using that means of dis-
seminating its tenets, instead of force.
It has long been known that the way to the heart is through the
stomach; but contending creeds have seldom appealed to the latter
organ except by *::: and thrusts, and blows, calculated to do grievous
bodily harm, and gain no spiritual advantage. Rival churches are
strongly advised "now "to substitute the weapons of nutrition
for those of offence. A cut of beef under the ribs is infinitely more
convincing to the *.*. than a puncture of bayonet ever was;
and a plum-pudding may be pitched into the lap to better effect than
a round shot. Dogmas that cannot be forced down the Oesophagus of
belief will be easily swallowed with slices of mince pie; and a string of
sausages, to say nothing of turkey, is equal to many strings of propo-
sitions.
The argumentum ad ventrem, or address to the gastric region, always
so sensible, and about Christmas so legitimate an expedient of prose-
lytism, may be reinforced by the argumentum ad cutem; the appeal to
the integument, or surface of the body. Coals and blankets, in short,
will be found jº. companions to beef, and pudding. Zeal, to be
efficacious, should impart warmth. With this remark we will dismiss
the subject of controversy, having suggested food for serious discussion,
which probably will be smoking hot.
Christmas Presents.
Of these the most remarkable this year are:-
PRESENCE OF MATTER—at the Christmas Cattle Shows.
PRESENCE OF MIND–in Punch's Almanack / / /
And
TEA AND TURN-out.-DISRAELI's Budget.

PAROCHIAL PARLIAMENTS.
ThERE are one or two suburban
vestries that really want “smash-

the right of º to busy
themselves with the subject of
taxation, or any other subject of
legitimate discussion; but while
they are professedly meeting as
a vestry, they ought not to puff
themselves up with the idea that
they are sitting as a Parliament.
They are appointed to mind the
affairs of the parish, but they
insist on attending, instead, to
the affairs of the nation.
Marylebone, as the most
rampant of these noisy little
senates, must really be made an
example of, if it does not restrain
its turbulent ambition within
proper—that is to say, chial
—limits. We cannot allow the
absurdity to f on much longer,
of an inflated vestryman rising
up “in his place,” talking of the

would then move also.”

orators. It is all very well for Marylebone to “pronounce,” but some
of the members would have to consult a pronouncing dictionary before

“ANOTHER NEW PLANET.”
THE above title is becoming quite a standing one in the
newspapers. “Another and another still succeeds” so rapidly,
that to talk of the planets being stationary while they are
going on at the rate of a new one nearly every month, is almost
ridiculous. MR. HIND, the astronomical “detective,” who
does the police duty of the skies, has recorded the result of
the “information he has received" in a letter to the Times of
last Thursday. He proposes to give to the new discovery the
title of THALIA, from which fact we presume that the star
seems suited to shine in Comedy. We are glad its début has
been made in time for our old friend ADAMs to include it in
the “Galaxy” of attraction that shines forth in his annual
Orrery. The only difficulty will be now to make room for all
the new stars on the very limited stage of the Adelphi, where
they are usually exhibited.

So that my buiden may—digest!
An Easy Explanation.
That which MR. DIsrAELI calls “the area of direct
taxa'ion" is the Area attached to your own private residence:
the “direct taxation” being the leg of mutton which mys-
teriously walks off directly a policeman enters it.
8AUCE FOR YANKEE slave-owners.
Soyer, has become so imbued with the feeling of Uncle
Tom's Cabin, that he has invented a new Fauce, which, out of
respect to Mas. Stowe, he has christened “The Tom-Martyr.”
GLoRY For GLAZIERs.-The Crystal Palace at Sydenham
will be a monument of what human industry can accomplish by
taking panes.
Menino
the task could be properly accomplished. We have no objection to the
members in their capacity of citizens having voices of their own on
public matters, and expressing their opinions freely at propertimes and
proper places, but we cannot consent to the absurdity of their assuming
the capacity of legislators, and thus evincing their incapacity as vestry-
men. The Marylebone vestry-room is continually the scene of some
.."; debate about ...; quite foreign to the business the vestry-
men have met to perform, and it not unfrequently happens that there
is an interchange of personal abuse, in the course of which the Chai:-
man's authority is set at nought. MR. SomeBody, Senior, gives the
lie to MR. Somebody, Junior; the rector is voted out of the chair,
MR. Nobody is voted into it, and everybody abuses everybody else, for
the purpose of settingº “example to the metropolis.”
We quite agree withſ the notion that the Marylebone Westry should
be made an example of, and we shall feel it our duty to carry out the
idea, if the same vanity and folly that have lately been so disgustingly
displayed are much longer persisted in.
The Triumph of Temperance.
The lovers and advocates of Temperance need only look at the
present size of the Quart and Pint Measures to be convinced of the
gradual decrease of drinking in this country.
OF THE SAME CAST OF MIND.
We are informed that, out of compliment to the EMPERoR
NApolkon III, every French cannon and bomb is for the future to be
stamped with the following inscription—“My Woice Is Foa Peace.”
UnrashionABLE ANNOUNCEMENT. – Gentlemen interested in the
reduction of the price of Beer are informed that MR. DisrAELI's Party
(invited to Pot Luck) is unavoidably postponed.
THE REAL Bottle CoNJUROR.—One who can extract two pints
from a quart bottle of wine.
