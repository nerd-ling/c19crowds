PRETA
MR.
R. PUNCH, at the last moment, cancels a very handsome Preface prepared for this his Twenty-FOURTH
VOLUME, in order to give insertion to a communication from the Head of the Horse-Guards : a document
to which, at the present time, and under the present tremulous circumstances—(foreign funds being as sensitive
as quicksilver in a thunder-storm)-Mr. Punch thinks it only wise and loyal to give the first place and
the boldest type.
“ Horse-Guards, June 14, 1853.
“ VISCOUNT HARDINGE—Commander-in-Chief of HER MAJESTY's Forces-presents his compliments
and felicitations to Mr. Punch; and desires that he will, at the promptest military time, cause to be delivered
at the Camp at Chobham, no less than Ten Thousand Copies of his Twenty-Fourth Volume; Viscount H.
-as an old and instructed reader of Punch-knowing that among the many blessings of an English
Midsummer, there is ever a new Volume of Punch; even as at Christmas-time another Volume is one of
the never-failing comforts and delights of that most jolly and most hospitable season.
“ The Commanding-Officer at Chobham has it in orders to receive the Volumes of Punch with every
possible military honour. On arriving at the Camp, Mr. Punch himself will be received by a General's
Guard, and be immediately conducted to the officer commanding.
“A salute of Four-and-twenty Guns will be fired on the Ten Thousand Copies of the Twenty-fourth
Volume reaching the ground; the troops presenting arms, and the Band playing God Save the Queen (with
roo-to-to-too-it variations).
“ The Commanding Officer will address the Troops before distributing the Volumes to the Forces.
That Officer has instructions to dwell most earnestly ou the many noble lessons abounding in every Page

PREFACE.
of Punch-to exhort the British Soldier so to study his Punch, that, whilst in time of peace he shall feel
as simple as the lamh that, all innocently, crops the mint—he shall, in the hour of war, be as the raging
lion that roars and whips himself for his shin of beef.
“ And here the Commander-in-Chief gladly avails himself of this pleasing opportunity to express his
acknowledgments to Mr. Punch for the abounding lessons of mirth and wisdom that, in the hottest weather
in India, have been more refreshing than gentle showers to the troops under ViscounT HARDINGE's
command; have been more animating than any grant of batta to the native soldier.
“Moral cheerfulness is the very life and soul of a Camp. Keep the soldier cheerful, and he is
ready for any work in any weather, and at any notice. It is, therefore, Mr. Punch, that as Commander-
in-Chief, I have thougbt it my duty to order, at the country's expense, the supply of ten thousand of
your Twenty-Fourth Volume for the troops at Chobham ; all the other twenty-three volumes, as I have
made it my duty to know, being in the possession of every soldier encamped there, and making an
inseparable part of his daily baggage. Yes, Mr. Punch, not only has the British soldier your works by
heart, but he has 'em on his shoulders.
“ Anticipating the many privations to be suffered by the heroes of Chobham-(where there will be
no Rotten Row, no Opera, no Club-House)—I nevertheless feel confident of the beneficial influence of
your pages upon HER MAJESTY's Forces, feeling assured that both on the part of the officers and men-
especially may I speak for the officers—the greatest sacrifices will be readily deferred to, if foregoing many
of their usual little comforts, they are permitted an unlimited supply of Punch.
“ Accept, Mr. Punch, the assurance of my distinguished consideration.
ardinge."
“ P.S. and Private. You will stop to dinner. In fact, bring a portmanteau for a week. There will
be a bullock roasted for every regiment the day of the distribution, with fireworks in the evening. If your
dog can dance, bring him : he'll take the conceit out of young FITZPIPECLAY and his lot."

still venture to give
my real age to the
inquisitive gentleman
who comes round with

I have not been driven
to seal up the fly-leaf of
the family Bible, which
records "AMELIAJANE,
born 1st May, 1830."
My husband, as all
my friends assure me,
is all a man ought to
be. I think he might
be a leetle less ob-
stinate, and I confess
he has a bad habit
of bringing his old
bachelor friends home
to dinner without
warning. When I re-

there may be for din-
ner, the chief thing

now-I say now, be-
cause it was not al.

I propose
to disclose, for the
benefit of young wo-
men about to marry,
the secret of our
former discomfort and
our present happiness.
The fact is, I was
brought up a strong-
minded woman. I was
educated on the Pes.
talozzian system
taught to ask ques-
tions about everything
and to insist upon an-
swers, and to question
the answers. After I
had pumped my go-

way, nonplussed papa,
and gravelled every-
body in the house, no

QUESTION FOR THE ADMIRALTY Court.-
If you are run down on board ship have you

AN OLD ENGLISH BEVERAGE.-The an-
cient apothecaries compounded aurum po-
tabile-drinkable gold : which, if made out
of coin, was an anticipation of the Yankee

WIT AND HUMOUR ABROAD.-The light
literature of foreign nations is not much

all the jokes are far-fetched.
THE LANGUAGE OF COSTUME.-The Saints

THE
LADIES OF THE CREATION,
a
composing myself. He attended three
courses
at the Institution, and de-
clared he had turn for science,
which I found out afterwards was only
a penchant for me. During three sea-
sons we sat on the same bench, inhaled
the same gases, started at the same
explosions. He put a great many
questions to the lecturer, and one ques-
tion to me, which I answered in the
affirmative. After our marriage, I found
that his taste for science declined rapidly.
He asked me no more questions about the
chemical affinities, and seemed perfectly
insensible to the curious discoveries
daily taking place in the entozoic and
palæontological fields of investigation.
The only questions he seemed inclined
to entertain were questions of house
expenses; and when one Friday I pro-
posed that we should attend PROFESSOR
FARADAY's lecture on a candle, he de-
clared he didn't care a snuff about such
things, and that he wished as I was
married, I would not bother my head
with such stuff! This was very painful
to me, and we had our first dispute
about this point. I quoted MRS. SOMER-
VILLE's example to prove that a woman
may be deep in science, and make no
worse wife for it. I told him about the
Russian princess with whom EULER cor-
responded, and the professoress who
used to lecture at Bologna, though she
was so pretty she had to address her
class from behind a curtain.
Nothing would convince him. He
scoffed at the scientific pretensions of the
sex, and when I carried the question still
further, and enlarged on the odious
tyranny by which men strove to cabin,
crib, and confine our minds and bodies,
he flew into a passion and went straight
off to his club, where he dined and came
in very late, smelling strongly of cigars.
I cried a good deal that night, but I am
sorry to say that I soon after returned to
the subject. And the more sure our
argument was to end in his leaving me
quite in a passion, for that abominable
marital harbour of refuge, the club, the
more sure, somehow or other, was the
conversation to come back to the same
point. In fact, I became quite wretched,
and I don't think he was a bit happier
than I was.
Had I not been luckily cured of my
notions about the equality of the sexes I
am sure we should have separated-a
miserable couple. And how do you think I
was cured? I had been reading the report
of that remarkable meeting at Syracuse,
Ohio, U. s., in which the rights and
wrongs of women were so forcibly set forth
by Miss LUCRETIA Mort and her friends.
I had had a perfectly awful argument with
EDWARD upon the report of the meeting in
the Times, and he had gone to the club as
usual, denouncing strong-minded women,
with an obvious allusion to me, and de-
claring that this continual discussion was
enough to wear a man's life out.
I retired to bed with a deep sense of
the wrongs of our sex, and of Edward's
brutality, and thinking what a world this
would be if women had their proper place
in it on an equality with men. I tried to
read myself to sleep with TENNYSON'S
Princess, and thought Ida's arguments
much more conclusive than the poet's
conclusions. At last I fell asleep, and
dreamed—such a dream, that it seemed
as if I lived a whole life through it all!
And now for my dream.
I was living in a world where the rela-
tions of the sexes were turned topsy-turvy.
The women filled the men's places, and
the lords of the creation were its ladies,
How we revelled in the change at first-
particularly after dinner! It was so plea-
sant to be left round the dining-room
table, to pass the decanters and discuss the
vintages and trifle with the dessert, while
one thought of the gentlemen yawning
over the albums and annuals, and getting
up dreary little bits of flat scandal over
cups of lukewarm tea, and boring each
other, and being bored, all alone in the
drawing-room. I rather think we talked a
good deal of nonsense about the wine, and

THE LADIES CREATION.

CHANCERY
LANE
St. James's, I saw at once what it was that made him so anxious
to hear the band. Imagine my feelings when I found that it was
composed of the nicest young ladies, in such very becoming
uniforms, with a stout old drum-majoress. Instead of fifes and
drums, the instruments used were guitars and pianos, and they
played JULLIEN's polkas, and marched away to the tune of
“ The girls we've left behind us." Altogether it struck me as
being a style of music better suited to dance to, than to march
to battle upon, and I could not but admit to myself that the old
fife and drum was more spirit-stirring of the two.
EDWARD wanting a new hat, I went with him to buy one;
but he was such a time about it, trying on upwards of a dozen
hats, that I thought I never should have got him away. I never
imagined before that shopping could be such a nuisance, and
then I saw at once that it is a merciful arrangement which
sends us to shop, and our husbands to wait for us.
I left EDWARD at GUNTER's and walked home. When I
reached our own door I was stopped by two over-dressed, tawdry,
fat women of the Jewish persuasion, who, tapping me on the
shoulder, produced a piece of paper, which they called a writ,
and informed me that I was their 'prisoner, on a judgment for
one of EDWARD's horrid cigar bills. I pointed out to them that
the debt was incurred by him, and begged them to take him ;
but they told me that the law now made the wife answerable
for the husband's debts, than which nothing can be
unjust. I felt at once that this was not a change for the better,
and that, after all, it was quite right that if somebody must pay
or go to prison, it should be the husband, and not the wife.
I was so annoyed by this latter circumstance, that I went
to call upon Mrs. BOROUGHBY (a recently elected Member of
Parliament) an old schoolfellow of Mama's, who had always
proved my constant friend. Such a scene of confusion as I then
witnessed, I shall never forget! The stairs were littered all

MR. PUNCH WILL BE HAPPY to make the acquaintance of the

The reason why you may ask for “greens " at a dinner-table,
but on no account for “cabbage."
The reason why gentlemen, upon their healths being drunk,
invariably feel it to be “the proudest moment of their life.”
The reason why ladies think it cheap to purchase things they

out shopping, but I was much too ill to
escort him. So I sent MARY, our foot-
maid, to take care of him and two of his
friends who called. MARY tells me they
were a good deal stared at in Regent Street
by some of the girls, but that she thought
her big stick and cocked hat frightened them.
I felt after this it was not safe for
EDWARD to walk about without me, and,
as he wanted to go into the City I threw
off my headache, and went with him; but,
feeling tired, we mounted an omnibus. The
Cad was a smart girl, but her language was
dreadfully “slang,” and I was shocked at
the style in which she “
gave it” (as she
said) to a poor old gentleman who was put
down somewhere where he didn't want to

buses.
We dined at VERREY's, and stayed until it
was dusk. I decided to walk home, not-
withstanding EDWARD's remarks about the
impropriety of being “in the street at that
time of night.” I pointed out to him that we
could always depend on the police, but-
alas !-I had forgotten that that Mrs. Com-
MISSIONER MAYNE was in power instead of
her husband. Just as we passed a horrid
gin-shop, out poured a rabble of drunken
people who insulted me dreadfully; and
when I called police, of course the poor
things were dreadfully alarmed by the beha.
viour of these wretches, one of whom
actually put his arm round the sergeant's
waist. If it hadn't been for the old private
watchman at the banking-house close by
(who frightened the drunken men), the con-
sequences might have been awful—perhaps
the constables might have been kissed all
round!
I felt then that, after all, street-keeping is
a coarse and brutal employment, fit only for
the other sex.
The next morning Emily BROWN (not
Julia, who was called to the Bar last year)
came in with her cousin, to whom she told
me she had proposed only the day before
while they were out fishing. Emily had
gone into the Navy, under Mrs. ADMIRAL
NAPIER, and seemed to me to have grown a -
sad wild sort of girl. She used nautical
phrases, “shivered her timbers” frequently,
and declared she wanted to “ splice the
main-brace," which, I discovered, was the
sailor way of asking for a glass of spirits !
Then she was full of stories about life on
board ship—what larks they used to have in
the cockpit, how she had been sent to the
mast-head for being saucy to the captainess,
and how dreadfully cold it was—and what
they used to suffer in rough weather, and
how they had to live for months together
on salt beef and biscuit; and altogether I
felt that it was an abominable thing to
condemn poor women to such hardships,
which, after all, men are better suited for.
After Emily and her cousin had left,
EDWARD insisted on my taking him to hear
the Band play at St. James's. Really I had
never before thought EDWARD so frivolous !
However, it was not worth while to con-
tradict him, so I took him. When we got to

IF young ladies have a fault it is sometimes in being a

former forwardness by going backwards regularly every
year.

THE LADIES
OF THE CREATION,
over with brooms, dust-pans, candle-sticks,
and coal-scuttles, and the drawing-room,
into which I was allowed to find my way
as I could, was in as great confusion as
a broker's shop. On an elegant ottoman
were a dust-pan and a bundle of wood; the
sofas were strewn with blue books, a pair of
slippers, an opera cloak, and the housemaid's
box of black lead and brushes.
An old grey parrot had got out of his
cage and was busily employed in picking
holes in a beautiful table-cover, whilst
“Buttons," the page, was seated at the
piano, endeavouring to pick out the notes of
an Ethiopian melody, called (I believe)
“ Sich a Gettin Up Stairs."
When I succeeded in making the young
gentleman aware of my presence, he coolly
told me that “Missus was busy, and wouldn't
be disturbed by nobody; and that Master had
gone out in a huff, 'cos he'd been rowed for
wanting to go to the play, as Missus was
gettin' up her Parliment speech for that
evenin'!"
This explained to me the state of the
“ Home Department;" and I left without
seeing MRS. BOROUGHBY, convinced that the
house in which woman should have a voice
was not the House of Commons.
And so my dream went on. Everywhere
I found that when women attempted men's
work, they proved their own unfitness for it
- discovered that our notions of the happi.
ness, and freedom, and dignity of the other
sex are founded on a mistake, and that it
only depends on us to make them our slaves
and adorers. It is true, we are not in the
House of Commons; but what, after all, is
public opinion? The opinion of men, if we

do justice to ourselves, is the opinion of
men's wives. Is there any field for political
maneuvre or legislation like Home? What
is a Chancellor of the Exchequer to a wife ?
- what the Budget to the weekly house-
bills 1—what the difficulty of wringing the
supplies out of the House of Commons to that
of extracting a cheque from a hard-up hubby?
Depend upon it there is employment for any
amount of jockeyship and management with-
out putting one's head beyond the street door.
And so I was cured of my notion of putting
woman on an equality with man.
I saw that the question between the sexes
was not one of superiority or inferiority; that
our two spheres lay apart from each other,
but that each exercised on the other a most
blessed influence-man's sphere, the world ;
woman's sphere, the home; the former
bracing the gentle influences of the latter by
its rough, sharp lessons of effort, endurance,
and antagonism ; the latter tempering the
hardening effects of the former by its self-de-
nial, its sympathies, and its affections.
And
I felt that if we are to compare these two
spheres, the woman's-while the narrower-
is, in many respects, the nobler of the two,
and her part in the battle of life not unfre-
quently the more important and dangerous
one.
This was the lesson of my dream. I awoke
just as EDWARD let himself in with his latch-
key, and I begged his pardon for my silly
forwardness.
I have never had another argument since ;
and I don't believe I have any “mission”
that can take me away from my own fire-
side,

DIRECTIONS FOR FAINTING.
NEVER faint when you are alone. Always select some good
opportunity. The more persons there are about you, the more
successful will be your fit. A friend's house, when there is a
dinner or an evening party going on, is far from a bad oppor-
tunity. Never faint more than once in the same evening, as
there may be a falling-off in the sympathy on the second expe-
riment. A woman should not only faint well, but be above
suspicion. Be very careful, therefore, never to risk a faint
unless you have some object in view, such as going out of
town-or a new gown-or a box at the Opera-or being taken
to some fete-or any other little caprice which your husband
may have obstinately refused you. In such cases hysterics
are sometimes justifiable.

on the day when it is put in force.

PUNCH AT THE ADELPHI.
* All work and no Play” proverbially make " a dull boy!” and it is
upon this acknowledged principle, we suppose, that the Westminster
Scholars annually act. At any rate, their acting this year shows that
the truth of the proverb may be proved by converse, for certainly the
spirit of dullness seems most thoroughly exorcised from their “boards."
The Adelphi is not a very lively play, either. Its levities are some-
what ponderous, and we question if it was not voted rather "slow" by
the critics of the period when it was produced. The parts of Micio and
Demea for instance are particularly “ dragging." They are both in the con-
ventional "heavy father” line, and the introduction of a couple of these
worthies is, of course, felt doubly tedious, where one is generally one
too many. There is a pleasant relief, however, in the humours of the
roguish servant, Syrus ; on whom the "comic business” principally
devolves. And we must say that the character lost none of its point in
the hands of the gentleman to whom it was entrusted. Especially we
should notice his delivery of the passage, where, after severely chaffing
one of the “heavy fathers” aforesaid-who, by the way, is one of the
distressed agriculturists of the period-he cautions him to keep a sharp
look out for things)" qua futura sunt, or, literally, "looming in the
future." We really think it was a bit of acting worthy even of Mr.
DISRAELI himself.
Altogether, then, we spent as pleasant an evening at the Adelphi in
Westminster as ever we remember doing at that in the Strand : and
we finally left the dormitory for our own without having felt a trace of
its naturally soporific influence.
The Beer King has palaces splendid and gay,
You meet them in London wherever you stray,
And Monopoly there-which no Parliament checks-
Supplies his Exchequer from dear double X.
And there, too, strange compounds, and mixtures of queer
Unwholesome ingredients, are vended as beer,
Molasses and liquorice and vitriol-what not P-
In short you may say that there's death in the pot.
Competition full soon would the Beer King bring down,
But the justices stand by his Majesty's Crown,
And shut every door a man ventures to ope
Against an Exclusionist worse than the Pope.
An Englishman's house is his castle, 'tis said,
But if he'd sell beer to procure himself bread,
The Beer King's wise licensers hinder his view,

Abolition of Christmas Boxes.
We know a celebrated Marquis, as mean as he is wealthy, who has
done away with his Christmas boxes this year, and the reason he
advances for the shabbiness of the abolition is, " the extreme scarcity
of silver.”

Ten were the members, while the goose was one-
One only was the prize : the blanks were nine.
The lucky chance could be for one alone-
I trembled as I hoped it would be mine.
As round the table anxiously we sat,
The strips of paper were together cast,
And shaken up in a policeman's hat:
My breath was thíck, my pulse beat high and fast.
I seized a number, but I feared to look :
I held it in my trembling fingers loose.
Had fate awarded me a goose to cook ?
Or had misfortune rudely cook'd my goose ?
They caught the

As on my breast my throbbing temples sank;
I gave a side-long look-a groan—a gasp-.

I PAID my shilling ! -paid it like a man,
Though much my capital it did reduce ;
But wildly my imagination ran
Upon that luscious luxury, a goose !
Yes! I became the member of a Club-
A Goose Club! Is it not a savoury thought ?
But shall I win the prize ? Ah! There's the rub!
Or will experience be by failure bought ?
I was a member of a Goose Club! Stay:
Let me throw water on my fever'd brow.
My brain, at the remembrance of that day,
Will be on fire. Ha! ha! 'tis burning now.
Yes! I subscrib'd my shilling! day by day.
I asked “Has fate destin'd that I should win??
At night, as tossing on my bed I lay,
I thought, “Will they give sage and onions in ?”
At length, the Christmas feast was drawing near;
The issue of my lot I soon should know :
There was a rumour, that of geese this year
Immense would be the price, and small the show.
The long-expected evening came at last,
The members of the Goose Club all had met,
Lots for the “foolish bird” were to be cast :.
I feel the heart-throb of that moment yet.
Our names were written out on paper strips,
All of the Club distinctly taken down:
JONES, TOMKINS, SPOONER, EDWARDS, BURTON, PHIPPS,
BENDIXEN, JACKSON, OLIPHANT, and BROWN.

And I've receiv'd from fortune many a rub;

From toils ministerial,
From state ceremonial,
From tangles imperial,
From murmurs colonial-
From net-work gigantic
Of red tape and tapists,
From Protestants frantic,
And high-flying Papists-
From all of the hobbles
Of MALMESBURY's peddling,
From all of the squabbles
Of Pakington's meddling.
From WALPOLE's well-meaning,
From BERESFORD's dirt,
From CHRISTOPHER's leaning
The truth out to blurt-
From bearing, in one sense,
Inscribed on your banners,
The feudalist nonsense
Of gentle John MANNERS,
From recording in acts
The entire contradiction
Which Free-trading facts
Give Protectionist fiction-
From having to swallow
Each word you have spoken,
From hopes all proved hollow,
From promises broken-
A FAREWELL TO DISRAELI.
From venting palaver
You inwardly mourn for,
From stooping to slaver
The men you feel scorn for-
From gracing PEEL's triumph,
However you grudge it,
From hearing all cry humph!”
At sight of your Budget-
From each trick, and turn
Of the baffled tactician,
Punch greets your return
To a nobler position !
For he saw in your rising
The work of a brain,
Which its own aggrandising
Had toiled to attain;
Unfavour'd by station,
Unaided by pelf,
You waited occasion,
And strove for yourself :
Till the House which derided
The youth who began-
Its laughter subsided-
Gave ear to the man;
And, subdued by the power
Of a resolute will,
Listened, hour after hour,
Deferential and still :
And in speech, subtle pleader,
In fight ne'er dismay'd,
You rose to be leader
Where once you obeyed.
Then the proud ones, your makers,
To bow were full fain,
The Lords of the Acrés
To the Lord of the Brain :
Had you been good as gallant,
Strong in wisdom as will,
High in truth as in talent,
Your cause good as ill,
That name--now a beacon
Of shoals we should shun-
Were a light to men seeking
How fame should be won.
Oh, unworthy possessor
Of powers seldom seen,
Greater wert thou, if lesser ;
Thy triumphs had been.
Oh, how grand once thy game-
But now past is its hour-
A life-time of fame
'Gainst a moment of power !
But the low gain thou chosest,
The high didst disdain,
And, when office thou losest,
Art nothing again.

A VALUABLE LESSON.
That the character of the Minister, no less than that of
the man, is formed in the nursery, may be denied by a few,
but has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of all candid
minds by the success of an article which appeared in one of
our recent numbers. _MR. GLADSTONE had objected to the
isolated merit of poor DISRAELI's budget, a scheme for a juster
Income Tax. We took the liberty of pointing out his error
to him in words of one and two syllables. And now LORD
ABERDEEN, with MR. GLADSTONE for his Chancellor of the
Exchequer, announces that the Income Tax is to be equitably
adjusted, according to the dictates of Common Sense and of
Punch. We might say a great deal more on this subject; but
we won't. We have no desire to blow our own trumpet-

A GUELPH IN TROUBLE.
In the list of persons against whom proclamation of out-
lawry was made the other day at the Sheriff's Court, occurs
no less a name, or roll of names, than CHARLES FREDERICK

patible with the blood of a GUELPH; that a genuine cousin-
well beloved or not-of HER MAJESTY should stand in so

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
MINISTERIAL PERQUISITES.
It is rather hard upon some of the late Ministers
who have given up a snug little business at the bar,
that since they have stood at the bar of public
opinion to be tried as Members of a Government, it
is against etiquette that they should return to their
former employment. There are two or three ex-
officials in this unpleasant predicament, whose minis-
terial professions and practice having become dis-
tasteful to the country at large, has caused them to
be dismissed from the public service, without having
their old profession and practice to fall back upon.
The LORD CHANCELLOR is the only fortunate one of
the party; for though in his dismissal from the wool-
sack, he may be said to receive the sack, he is
allowed to retain the wool in the shape of a handsome
pension, by way of perquisite.

very first men I met was poor SWISHER, the schoolmaster, who came up
to a Hall (I will not say which, for I would not hurt his feelings for the
world), in the vain hope of getting a degree, and thereby strengthening
his connexion in the country. Such a contrast to the bravery of the
READ
boys who thronged that promenade, with their hairy coats, and gold
chains, and adventurous trowsers, and other gallantries ! Quite a dull
spot was SWISHER in the midst of the splendid crowd, who almost
sneered at his coat, which certainly was very badly made, and his large
boots; by the way, I wish somebody would write to the Gentleman's
Magazine, or the Notes and Queries, if it is still going on, and ask how it
is that directly a man is poor his feet seem to grow to such an awful size.
Well! SWISHER comes up every year, invested with the prestige of
failure, and fails as before, though he is the most pains-taking fellow
possible. They say (of course it is a wicked joke, and nothing more,) that
his little girl habitually runs into the house and cries “ Mamma, Mamma,
Pa’s plucked again!" The last time he went in he was completely
stumped out by the Latin prose-one of those horrid bits from the
Spectator about Will HONEYCOMB—and he passed a slip of paper to his
neighbour, containing this touching request : “Pray, Sir, for Heaven's
sake, tell a married man, with three small children, the Latin for Fleet
Street;" but no aid could save him, he is hopelessly, helplessly stupid.
I never could understand what he does with those few sheep in the
wilderness when he is away; or, in fact, what he does with them when
he isn't. Poor fellow! If I had my will he should be turned out a
double first a Doctor of Divinity, or Grand Compounder and Classical
Tripos, or whatever he wants. His perseverance is heroic, and he is a
worthy, honest man, although he cannot tell the Latin for Fleet Street,
or Charing Cross, or Piccadilly. And his little wife, so humble, and
kind, and good, is worth all the Dons' ladies put together, with their
silks, and satins, and underbred insolence.
And here, my dear CHARLEY, let me advise you always to shirk a Don's
party if you can do so decently. I am not speaking of College tutors-
they are irreproachable, especially your men at Margaret's—but of the
great guns, the old fellows who wear the very swell gowns on Sundays,
and keep dismal houses and vulgar wives. They sometimes let in a few
undergraduates to the awful conclave, and expect them to worship in
silence. You will find the women stuck up against the wall in a row, as
if they were for sale; and, if you have the audacity to speak to one of
them you will catch it, and no mistake. Why, I remember, when I
was a youngster, being put on in lecture every day for a whole term by

he got his fellowship at Christopher's. He was elected forty years ago,
in the good old times that RAILTON is so fond of, because he came
from Stokehampton parish in Wessex. You may say there is some
merit in that, for the district only includes fifty houses, and he has
certainly been of use to his College as a judge of Port wine. Besides, to

« THE BAKER."
Who is it, in an idle hour,
Grinds up some beans both cheap and sour,
To mix them with his wheaten ffour ?
The Baker!
Who if a trifling rise in price,
Occurs in corn, will not be nice,
But in the bread will charge it twice ?
The Baker!
Who when the corn is “down again,"
Is such a thorough rogue in grain,
The rise in bread still to maintain ?
The Baker!
Who is it, when we send a pie,
Will child-like take a straw and try
To suck it of the syrup dry?
The Baker!
Who is it, when we trust some ribs
Of beef to bake, a portion cribs,
And hides the fault by wicked fibs ? -
The Baker!
Who, if we miss a piece of fat,
Has always got an answer pat,
And lays it on a neighbour's cat ?
The Baker!
Who from rice pudding, with a cup,
Extracts the custard-every sup-
And says the fire has dried it up?

Cheats us at such a fearful rate
That every loaf is short in weight ?

THE BLACK JOB OF THE CITY.
We always begin to burn with indignation, when we think
of our coals and the tax we have to pay for them to the LORD
MAYOR and Aldermen of London. They frequently tax our
patience by their obtuseness, and our gravity by their absurdity,
but why they should tax our coals we cannot tell, unless it is
that they feel a sort of right to place upon illumination or
enlightenment as much restriction as possible. The tax was
originally confined to coals coming to London by the Thames,
it being thought, probably, that the right of bringing. com-
bustibles by the river might interfere with the old privilege
of "setting the Thames on fire,” which is supposed to be
vested in the LORD MAYOR and Aldermen. The subject is
now boldly grasped, and coal is being taken in hand, with a
view to a thorough sifting. Those who have had the fingering
of coal for so many years cannot come out of the affair with
clean hands, but the sooner the dirty affair is got rid of, the
better it will be for the character of the Corporation, and the
pockets of the public.
THE RELEASE OF MADIAI!

Where Huss and JEROME were inscribed before,

Of felon's death-pang whitened, and his gore
Made red no scatfold; glowing pincers tore
Not his quick flesh; nor did the martyrdom
Of fiery torment his fell butchers glut.
But him did LEOPOLD, the dastard tool
Of Popery, in a loathsome dungeon shut,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
THE SWEEP AND MANY FRIENDS.
A SWEEP has just been having what may be called a brush
with the Post-Office. The “honest fellow” happens to find
the Newcastle mail bag lying in Coppice Row, when instead
of sacking the bag, he asks the assistance of a policeman to
carry it to the Post-Office. The “honest fellow” naturally
expects a reward, and on being offered ten shillings, he writes
to the Times to say that acting under the advice of “his friends,"
he has refused the gratuity. We do not exactly understand
the principle on which the sweep, as advised by his “friends
in council,” has declined taking the money. Is it considered
that ten shillings is not enough for carrying a bag to the nearest
police station—to which the mail was conveyed by the help of
a constable-or does “the honest fellow," as advised by his
friends, adopt the respectable maxim that “honesty is its
own reward," and that any thing extra may therefore be
rejected as surplusage? When questioned by the policeman
who met him carrying the bag, the sweep certainly appeared
to come out of the matter with clean hands, and indeed
he only expressed a wish to wash his hands of the bag alto-
gether.
As a remuneration for his labours, we think ten shillings
must pay the sweep tolerably well for a short morning's work,
but if his friends think he ought to charge for his honesty,
we should find it difficult to estimate the value of that article
in a man who is induced to haggle about the worth of it.
Suppose the sweep were offered five pounds, would his friends
advise him to accept that amount as the sum representing
the price of his integrity ? WALPOLE --not the late Home
Secretary-said that
every man has his price." We wish
we could see a regular tariff drawn up, as a guide in such
cases as that of the sweep, who has evidently consulted his
friends for the purpose of obtaining satisfaction. ?

in the Times or Punch? However, the Emperor has now re-
ceived all the credentials of relationship; and the epithets of
endearment that sweetened them have been so many bon-bons
filled with cordials to the Royal stomach. Our friend the
reader knows right well the pretty, the ingenuous, the affection-
ate phrases with which, in a very contest of tenderness and
love, the governesses and nurses of GARGANTUA were wont to
address their darling. The epithets are, for one thing, a little
too numerous to be repeated in our page-enough is it, we have
touched upon them; but merely in illustration of the lavish
affection that has been bestowed, in so many different syllables,
on the Imperial GARGANTUA at present studying in Paris. For
reasons of State these endearing terms have, for the present,
been suppressed; and colder and more ceremonial phrases
supplied. There is, however, good reason for this. It is well
known that NAPOLEON THE THIRD never so much as sneezes
without good reason for it. Sagacious as an oyster, he is also

position. This effort of genius is described as meant to pourtray
We have been favoured with the inspection of a design for a painted
window to be put up in Rochester Cathedral at the expense of the
DEAN and CHAPTER.
When we say, at the expense of the Dean and CHAPTER, we do not
mean to insinuate that the DEAN and CHAPTER are going to pay for the
window.
The design is divided into compartments, each representing, in the
medieval fashion, a "Fytte,” in “Ye Gestes of MAISTER ROBERT
WHYSTON ye CONFESSOUR.”
In Compartment 1, at the left hand corner of the window, the Master
of the Cathedral School, WHIston, is seen standing beside a lectern or
reading desk, whereon lie some scrolls of parchment inscribed with
black letter, which he is supposed to be reading; although, in accord-
ance with the principles of ancient art, he is delineated fronting the
spectator. His arms are averted sideways, with the hands uplifted,
and the palms open. He rests on the points of his toes, and his cap is
raised from his head on those of his hair, which is standing on end.
The contorted mouth and goggle eyes express horror and astonishment.
Beneath is written,
Maistre Wyston wrytinge Cathedrall Trustes and theyt
Fulfillmente.
The fourth picture exhibits in one view the interior and exterior of
the Cathedral School. In the school-room are a number of figures, who
are recognised by their corpulence and shovel hats as identical with the
occupants of the Chapter-House before depicted. A figure of superior
obesity to the rest, whom, as their CORYPHÆUS, there is no mistaking,
is kicking the CONFESSOR WHISTON out of doors; the others are joining
their hands in what seems devotion, but is intended for applause. The
emaciated scholars are here introduced as trampled on and sprawling
beneath their feet. The title under-written is

Statutes were Ybroke.

In the next scene our hero appears pleading the cause of the
Cathedral Scholars, in the Chapter-Room, before the Dean and his
associates. With one hand (which is wide open) he extends the Statutes
towards the capitular body; the other he stretches over the heads of a
party of emaciated youths in academic costume, and angular postures,
who are making dolorously wry faces, and have labels issuing from
their mouths, inscribed with the legends, “WEE ARE STARVING," "Gyv Maister Whistonne thrust forth of his schoole by ye Deane

you may obtain an order signed by an official named CHARLES JAMES

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

I have a belief, also, that many a quarrel might have been prevented,
if, when the dispute was at its height, one of the disputants had had
the good sense to offer his antagonist a pinch of snuff.
I don't admire or like a woman who takes snuff, any more than I like
a woman who smokes, or drinks, or indulges in any other masculine
vice. It seems to have a different effect upon her altogether to what it
has upon a man; and, besides, she is loquacious enough without it.
Moreover, I have remarked, that the woman who takes snuff is gene-
rally passionate, and has a red nose, which would seem to suggest
drinking. I have a notion that Xantippe took snuff.
What would Kings and Emperors have done if there had been no
such invention as snuff? They would have been puzzled what presents
to make to singers, ambassadors, and others. Calculate all the snuff-
boxes NICHOLAS has given away, and say, what could he have given in
their stead? Besides, the snuff-box is an elegant excuse for the royal
potentate to smuggle in his own portrait (with a diamond frame, of
course) upon the lid. Ask LABLACHE-who, they say, has a different
snuff-box for every day in the year-whether he would have liked
diamond pins, or rings, in preference to snuff boxes! He wouldn't
have cared "the snuff of a candle” for presents like those, which he
would have been obliged to bury in his drawer, and which, if he had
carried about with him, could never have yielded'him and others a fresh
source of delight every time he opened it.
It is a question, however, if the handsome present of a snuff-box has
not made many a person take snuff who never took snuff before.
Snuff is a great leveller. The poet who takes snuff out of a prince's
snuff-box puts himself, for the moment, on the same footing.
There is a great deal of communion, also, in a snuff-box. I know of
no other species of property that undergoes the same equal distribution
without being followed by discontent or quarrelling. Snuff-takers seem
to have adopted as their motto—“Share and share alike.”
In fact, when I consider the good feeling, the perfect freedom and
equality, amongst all persons who take snuff, I think there could not

therefore knows all about it. And why can't I feel just as I felt in the

happy-and the flowers so bright, so balmy through the rain-drops that

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
LOGIC FOR THE LEGREES.
To MRS. LEGREE, MRS. JONATHAN JEFFERSON JACKSON
LEGREE, and the MissES LEGREE.
MY DEAR LADIES,
THE more I think of your retort on our females about
Slavery, the more I like it. Some have said it was not yours
-no woman's work. But I had no doubt whose it was. Yes,
yes : I think, we do know the sweet American hand.
Besides, your logic was too conclusive, your statements
were too exact, for mere man.
Crime, poverty, and ignorance are as bad as slavery, of
course. Ignorance, poverty, and crime are British institutions,
just as slavery is an American one.
We let the Irish starve during the famine, without giving
them a cent. In order to keep them in superstitious igno-
rance, regardless of the wishes of their enlightened priesthood,
we established the QUEEN's Colleges upon a sectarian prin-
ciple, judiciously condemned by the Synod of Thurles.
The wretchedness, the wickedness, the nescience of our
people result from Acts of Parliament to such ends expressly
made and provided. It is a legal and a social crime to educate
the poor. No attempt is made to ameliorate their condition.
We have no hospitals, no ragged schools, no baths and wash-
houses.
If they attempt to escape from the slavery of circumstances
to a better state---say to Australia--we drag them back
again. A fugitive slave law for that very purpose was enacted
last session.
My dear Sisters, fulfil your mission. Teach your husbands
-fathers-brothers-sweethearts-true Christianity. Their
nigger is not their neighbour; they have no duty to him. All
argument to the contrary is an attempt to prove black white.
And if that point could be proved, it would follow that if
the white Americans were justified in asserting their inde-
pendence with the sword, the black negroes would be equally
right in vindicating their freedom with the knife. That, dear
ladies, is doubtless as clear to you as it is to
PUACU.

By an Act to amend the laws respecting the carriage of
passengers by sea, passed last year, it is prescribed that if the
ship be intended to enter the tropics, 15 clear superficial feet,
and a berth 6 feet long and 18 inches wide shall be allotted
to each passenger. This Act did not contemplate the emigra-
tion of aldermen. Allotting but 18 inches width for a berth,
it seems to have been based on the most narrow views. Its
framers probably supposed that all emigrants must be
starving, to entertain the idea of squeezing them into 18-inch
grooves. Or, perhaps they were sleepily confounding the
measure before them with an interment bill, and dreamt
that they were regulating the dimensions of the “narrow

Though a month may pass unclouded,

Yet, as week on week advances,

“Tell the men we've changed our mind--we won't go to-day," says
FREDERICK.
“Not go, FRED!" and I can't help it-I give him a look.
“Oh, very well, be it so,” says FRED. “In half-an-hour then; only
depend upon it, we shall have a storm.”
JOSEPHINE walks very slowly towards the door ; stops, and then
turns back. “If you please, ma'am, you'll not want me! I'm very
fond of the sea, ma'am, but if the weather gets up, I've nothing that will

“I'm sure”—and I go towards the window—“I'm sure, FRED, you
only wish to frighten me—for the ocean never looked more calm-like
a sleeping beauty.” FREDERICK whistles. “That means”-I say to
him-" that means, I suppose, we're not to go at all?”
Go! If your heart's set upon it, you shall go, LOTTY; yes, to the very
bottom.”
I make a little bit of a start at FRED's composure; but directly
recover myself. Then I'd better go and get ready ? ”
Go,” says FRED.
I feel almost about to cry, but spirit-it's a great comfort, and a
sweet support-spirit comes to my help, and I leave the room with a
sort of smile, and already hold the handle of the door, and am about to
give it-before I know what I'm doing-such a pull to, when, oddly
enough, I shut it so softly, as though it was the door of a jewel cabinet.

say she should be so glad to go, only that what she has won't wash-
which I know is not quite true-and moreover she'd an ugly dream

THE RAINS AND THE RAILWAYS.
An ingenious writer in the Suffolk Chronicle, speaking of
the late unusual continuance of wet weather, which he says
“is at length beginning to attract the serious attention of
the scientific ” (himself obviously inclusive), asks with a
naïveté which we think is quite refreshing-
“Whether, if iron be a conductor of electricity, it is not probable that the
immense intersections of the country by railroads may have some specific
effect on the clouds, while the electricity may keep up the temperature above
the point of frost or snow ? "
Well, it may, certainly; though we own we cannot suf-
ficiently give our imagination the rains to think it “probable.”
In one sense, we admit, the Railways may be said to have
exercised a dampening influence upon the country, inasmuch as
they have unquestionably brought many "a rainy day,” (as it
is termed) to many an unlucky speculator. But although the
'atmospheric principle” was once a good deal talked about,
we doubt if it was ever found to have that “specific effect
on the clouds” which the writer of the above has somewhat
cloudily, we think, suggested.

Loyalty of the Rising Generation.
By way of keeping up a wholesome spirit of loyalty in the
Rising Generation, it is customary at all our public schools
to observe the thirtieth of January, the anniversary of the
Martyrdom of CHARLES, by giving the boys a holiday. We
have no doubt the intention is to cherish a love for monarchy
in the youthful mind, by making a sort of solemnity of the day
of the execution of the unfortunate CHARLES; but we fear the
purpose is not answered, for the only observation we ever
heard made upon the subject was by a youth, who exclaimed,
* To-morrow's a holiday for the Martyrdom of CHARLES!
Oh! how jolly it would have been if all the kings had been
beheaded!”

PEACE ANECDOTES,
To Mr. Punch.
SIR,
' Having had the pleasure of hearing one MR. BARCLAY Fox,
of Falmouth, narrate to the Manchester Peace Conference a charming
anecdote of a French Captain, who having captured a Quaker's vessel,
instantly restored it on finding that the owner would not fight, I have gone
through various histories in my possession, and have transcribed a few
similar Peace Anecdotes, equally authentic, and equally satisfactory as
proofs that we have nothing to fear from Louis NAPOLEON. I beg you
to accept them. You may rely upon the accuracy of the details,

was begun by England.

TRAINS
HE MUST HAVE BLOOD!
A FRENCH Legitimist writer talking of the treaties of
1815, describes them elegantly as “a page of mud," and he
adds with a true sanguinary gusto, that there is not sufficient
blood in the veins of 10,000,000 of men to wash out that
immense stain." Whether the treaties were written in mud,
we can't say. But this Legitimist notion of washing out
“mud” with "blood,” is remarkable alike for its folly and
ferocity. To our own eyes, "blood” is a far more sorry sight
than "mud,” and the lasting stain left by the former is much
more revolting than the temporary blot caused by the latter.
Unfortunately, however, for France, there are some French-
men-happily a minority, we hope, of the nation-to whom
Gory and Glory are alike in sense as well as in sound, and wha
go about howling "Death to the English!” like this mur-
derous maniac, who couples his amiable watchword with the
assertion that "the French carry life throughout all the
countries where they penetrate."
Mr. Cobden in Error.
MR. COBDEN, in his recent “Letters,” takes occasion to
remark, with a considerable amount of emphasis for so pacific
a writer, that notwithstanding, in the last fifteen years or so,
there have been added upwards of 100,000 men to our naval
and military establishments, the public press is still continually
to be found complaining of their“ great deficiency.” Now, if
this be the rule with our contemporaries, we certainly must
plead ourselves complete exceptions to it. For, considering
what a number of superannuated veterans are kept on what
of course to them is nominally "active" service, we cannot
think we have to complain so much of the “deficiency” of our
forces, as of their surplus-age.
A TEMPERANCE FROLIC.
We lately saw, in a paper, an announcement of the promo:
tion of the “Assistant Engineer of the first class of the
Devastation," by name “Mr. R. GROG.” We suspect that
the paragraph thus connecting GROG with Devastation must

The precious treasure having been shipped under a salute of sixteen

on its arrival in London, was received at Austin Friars by a represen-

Then fly with me! My bark is on the shore,

And though she's nearly full, can take some more
Dry goods, by measurement-say GREEN and Sons.
Yes, fly with me! Had all our friends been blind,
We might have married, and been happy here ;
But since young married fólks the means must find
The eyes of stern society to cheer,
And satisfy its numerous demands,
I think 'twill save us many a vain expense,

Seeing that system has turned out a failure.
And as regards the rising generation,
We'll have a bill promoting education.
The law, we mean, shall be reformed, at least a
Portion thereof. The Budget comes at Easter.
I'm shocked to hear complaints, from Hull to Highbury,
That at elections there is so much bribery.
We must administer some awful doses
To sicken FRAILS of that atrocious process.
I don't desire to say a thing to hurt you,
But bribery don't combine with public virtue.
The Courts Ecclesiastic must come down,
Though MR. MOORE and his allies may frown,
And, lastly, we 'll put everything to rights
About the pilots, harbour dues, and lights.
As for Reform, I think it's pretty clear,
That should stand over till— let's say next year,
When, having sought all kinds of information,
We'll frame a bill to satisfy the nation.

ANYTHING BUT A BILLOT-DOUX.
We have just read M. Billot's Lettres Franques, in which he
proves clearly that it is as much the duty as the desire of France to
walk into" England, first in the literal, and afterwards in the pugi-
listic sense of the word.
Our hair stands on end, and our hand trembles as we lay down the
explosive volume! A sulphurous odour exhales from its pages, which
must have been manufactured of “gun cotton.”
"Every bullet has its billet,” says the olden proverb. If the con-
verse hold true, and “Every Billot has his bullet," what a bombarding
France will give us! As it is, luckily, the pellets are of paper instead
of lead, though from their heaviness this might not be suspected.
THE FIRST SENSIBLE VALENTINE.
I (One of the most astonishing fruits of the Emigration Mania.)
LET other swains, upon the best cream-laid
Or wire-wove note, their amorous strains indite;
Or, in despair, invoke the limner's aid
To paint the sufferings they cannot write:
Upon their page, transfixed with numerous darts,
Let slender youths in agony expire;
Or, on one spit, let two pale pink calves' hearts
Roast at some fierce imaginary fire.
Let ANGELINA, there, as in a bower
Of shrubs, unknown to LINDLEY, she reposes,
See her own ALFRED to the old church tower
Led on by CUPID, in a chain of roses ;
Or let the wreath, when raised, a cage reveal,
Wherein two doves their little bills entwine ;
(A vile device, which always makes me feel
Marriage would only add your bills to mine).
For arts like these I've neither skill nor time;
But if you 'll seek the Diggings, dearest maid,
And share my fortune in that happies clime,
Your berth is taken, and your passage paid.
For reading, lately, in my list of things,

The horrid host of buttons and of strings
Flashed on my spirit, and I thought--of you. i

A Rehearsing Clergy.
It seems that in Boston, the American public do not countenance
the clergy if they attend concerts. Now, many of the clergy wanted to
hear MADAME SONTAG; and MADAME SONTAG, like a good lady-like
creature as she is, wanted to be heard by the clergy: How was this to
be managed? How should the German nightingale trill, and jug-jug
to the Church blackbirds ? Why, Madame invited them all to a
" rehearsal ;” and the casuists went. The iniquity, it seems, is in the
real concert ; but there can be no sin in the rehearsal of the wickedness.

by the following extract from a bill which JULLIEN

have given the name of the Oxford Mixture :-
“ It is also respectfully requested thal, out of consideration
to the Ladies present, Gentlemen will abstain from smoking, and
permit the performance to be carried on without interruption.”
If this request has been rendered necessary by
the conduct of any of the graduates, we are
compelled to say that gentlemanly manners
appear to become “small by degrees and beau-
tifully less.". Oxford must really be in a semi-
barbarous state, if it is necessary to call on
the gown and town to permit a public enter-

smoke of cigars into the ladies' faces, and with
a sufficient avoidance of riot and confusion to
allow the performance to proceed. We should
be almost afraid that this concession to the

that JULLIEN, whose air is elegance itself,
should object to the odour of tobacco, and that
the greatest master of the art of puffing should
be sensitive to the smoking of an ill-timed cigar.

been "let in ” to a serious amount by the speculating clergy-
man. Having been persuaded to visit the Stock Exchange,
the parson was suddenly surrounded and punished, without
the slightest benefit of clergy being allowed to him. His coat
was covered with flour thrown from bags, without the smallest
respect for his cloth, and he was pelted with eggs, of which
there was an ample supply in readiness to make-as was re-
marked by an unhappy punster on the spot-a terrible eggs-
ample of the defaulting clergyman. The Reverend Gent's
white choker was so besmeared with batter, that he was obliged
to rush from the Stock Exchange to exchange his stock at the
nearest hosier's. The affair, happening as it did on or about
Shrove Tuesday, caused some who saw the parson covered
with eggs and flour, to suppose that he had fallen into a quan-
tity of batter prepared for the manufacture of pan-cakes.
We are no admirers of Lynch law in any shape; but if
parsons will throw a stain on their characters, they must be
prepared to have the stain made manifest on their clothes, in
the way adopted the other day by the members of the Stock
Exchange.

WRECK OF A PAPAL BRIG.
We have to record the wreck of His HOLINESS's Brig,
Torquemada, F. Lucas, Commander, which on Thursday night,
during a brisk gale off the Tuscan coast, broke loose from her
moorings at St. Stephen's, and drifted away so far out of her
course as the Society Islands in the South Pacific, when she
ran ashore on the coast of Tahiti, between 17° 28' and 17° 53'
S. lat., and 149° 11' and 149° 39' W. long. The mate, BOWYER,
made the best exertions he could for the preservation of the
vessel; but she has been so much damaged that it is believed
she must go to pieces in the event of her ever getting afloat
again; so that the probability is, that she will be condemned:
in which case her timbers will make capital firewood.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MEMBER FOR TOLERATION.
THE Times, in its summary of Thursday night's debate on the subject
of papistical persecution in Tuscany, records that
“ LORD JOHN RUSSELL professed himself totally at a loss to know whether MR. LUCAS
approved or not of persecution for religious opinions."
We are quite sure that Mr. Lucas does not approve of persecution
for opinions that he considers religious. The Honourable Member for
Meath, we are convinced, would be the last man to defend the perse-
cution of anybody for the opinion that St. SCHOLASTICA shone in the
dark; that ST. ANTHONY preached to the fishes ; that St. Denis held
his own decorporated head in his hands; that the House at Loretto flew
through the air; that the blood of St. JANUARIUS melts from a
supernatural cause; or, that the Rimini Picture cocked its eye from
ditto. Because all these things are, in the eyes of MR. Lucas, really
matters of religious opinion; that is to say, you are not absolutely
required to believe them by Mr. Lucas's Church ; but allowed to
believe them if you like.
Whether MR. Lucas approves of the toleration of irreligious
opinions is another matter. Perhaps he might not be quite inclined
to tolerate the opinion- of THOMAS CARLYLE we think that what he,
FREDERICK LUCAS, considers to be his holy Father, is a “triple-batted
Chimæra, calling itself Pope." Nor is it certain that he would desire
the toleration of the several other opinions which follow from this
one--and are entertained by the majority of the British public.
It is, however, our firm conviction, that the liberal Member for
Meath is decidedly opposed to all persecution for religious opinions,
and religious belief properly-as he thinks--so called: that is to
say, for the opinions that Rome permits, and the creed that Rome
enjoins.
No Protestant, of course, can, in the view of MR. LUCAS, have any
religious opinions at all, unless he happens to be of opinion that any
of the Roman Catholic legends are true. His Protestantism is an
aggregate of opinions which are not religious; but just the reverse.
He is of no religion : what he calls-such is heresy. It is impossible to
persecute anybody for religion, except a Roman Catholic; because
nobody else has any religion for which he can be persecuted: and the
persuasions of all other people, in that regard, are scandalous, wicked,
odious, pernicious, blasphemous, detestable, and - we suppose-
roastable.
CATECHISM FOR MAJOR CANONS.
The newspapers have published a long string of questions, addressed
by the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, on behalf of the Commissioners
for inquiring into the state of Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, to
the various Deans and Chapters, respecting the constitution, arrange-
ments, and economy of their several establishments.
From this list of interrogatories, however, the following are omitted
-notwithstanding their importance.

neighbours over the water. The most injurious suspicions had been
excited against the inhabitants of the New Cut. You had been told
that the population of Lambeth Marsh were only awaiting an oppor
tunity to cross the Thames and plunder the Strand and Cheapside.
It was by these and such like monstrous alarm cries, that the requisi-
tion of a Police Force was supported. Across the river, and every-
where else, people now simply minded their own business. Covetous-
ness was obsolete: there were no rogues any longer, or at least very
few; and if you wanted to put thieves down, you must try some better
plan than taking them up. He had calculated the cost of our Con-
stabulary, and found it to exceed, very far, the loss which could possibly
be sustained from robbers and thieves. The treadwheel revolved a
certain number of times in one hour. He had computed that each

revolution of every treadwheel cost sixpence. Here were revolutions
that might well astound us. The revolutions of the treadmill, at a
moderate estimate, had cost us £2,000,000,000 since its first establish-
ment. Would all the burglaries, highway robberies, felonies, and

ELEGY

WRITTEN IN A RAILWAY STATION.
TAE Station clock proclaims the close of day;
The hard-worked clerks drop gladly off to tea;
The last train out starts on its dangerous way,
And leaves the place to darkness and to me.
Now fades the panting engine's red tail light,
And all the platform solemn stillness holds,
Save where the watchmen, pacing for the night,
By smothered coughs announce their several colds.
Behind that door of three-inch planking made,
Those frosted panes placed too high up to peep,
All in their iron safes securely laid,
The cooked account-books of the Railway sleep.
The Debts to credit side so neatly borne,
What should be losses, profits proved instead;
The Dividends those pages that adorn
No more shall turn the fond Shareholder's head.
Oft did the doubtful to their balance yield,
Their evidence arithmetic could choke:
| How jocund were they that to them appealed !
How many votes of thanks did they provoke!
Let not Derision mock King Hudson's toil,
Who made things pleasant greenhorns to allure;
Nor prudery give hard names to the spoil
'Twas glad to share-while it could share secure.
All know the way that he his fortune made,
How he bought votes and consciences did hire;
How hands that Gold and Silver-sticks have swayed
To grasp his dirty palm would oft aspire,
Till these accounts at last their doctored page,
Thanks to mischance and panic, did unroll,
When virtue suddenly became the rage,
And wiped GEORGE Hudson out of fashion's scroll.
Full many a noble Lord who once serene
The feasts at Albert Gate was glad to share,
For tricks he blushed not at, or blushed unseen,
Now cuts the Iron King with vacant stare.
For those who, mindful of their money fled,
Rejoice in retribution, sure though late
Should they, by ruin to reflection led,
Ask Punch to point the moral of his fate,
Haply that wooden-headed sage may say,
Oft have I seen him, in his fortune's dawn,
When at his levees elbowing their way,
Peer's ermine might be seen and Bishop's lawn.
“There the great man vouchsafed in turn to each
Advice, what scrip or shares 'twas best to buy,
There his own arts his favourites he would teach,
And put them up to good things on the sly.
“Till to the House by his admirers borne,
Warmed with Champagne in flustered speech he strove,
And on through commerce, colonies, and corn,
Like engine, without break or driver, drove.
“Till when he ceased to dip in fortune's till,
Out came one cooked account-of our M.P.;
Another came-yet men scarce ventured, still,
To think their idol such a rogue could be.
“ Until those figures set in sad array
Proved how his victims he had fleeced and shorn-
Approach and read (if thou canst read) my lay,
Writ on him more in sadness than in scorn.
A VISIT TO THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.
LORD CRANWORTH, LAW, AND PHYSIC.
In the House of Lords, the other evening, LORD CRANWORTH is
reported to have expressed an apprehension in which few will partici-
pate. He intimated that there was some fear that a Lord Chancellor
might get on too fast with Chancery Reform. This extremely im-
probable contingency his Lordship illustrated by what he imagined to
be a parallel case :-
“ There might be, in short, a little danger lest the holder of the Great Seal should
fall into a course something like that occasionally pursued by inferior medical prac-
titioners, who prescribe for their patients doses of physic, when the best thing would
have been, probably, to let them alone."
It is the best thing to let patients alone under one of two opposite
conditions—and those two only. 1. When it is clear that no medicine
will expedite the patient's recovery. 2. When it is manifest that no
medicine will save him.
Does LORD CRANWORTH think that Chancery will reform itself
without legislation ? Or, does he consider it to be in so bad a state
that there is no hope of its amendment ?
An Emperor's Joke.
Louis NAPOLEON justifies the fact of his not permitting the Legis-
lative Assembly or the Senators to say a word by the good old English
joke, that “It is necessary and proper to have plenty of Mutes at his
great undertaking."
THE EPITAPH.
Here lies, the gilt rubbed off his sordid earth,
A man whom Fortune made to Fashion known;
Though void alike of breeding, parts, or birth,
God Mammon early marked him for his own.
Large was his fortune, but he bought it dear;
What he won foully he did freely spend.
He plundered no one knows how much a year,
But Chancery o’ertook him in the end.
No further seek his frailties to disclose:
For many of his sins should share the load :
While he kept rising, who asked how he rose ?
While we could reap, what cared we how he sowed ?
A LARCENOUS IMPOST.
It is strange that MR. FREWEN's resolution tending to the repeal of
the Hop Duty should have been rejected, when it is manifest that every
shilling of tax levied on a pocket of hops is picking the pocket.

O
MUNIFICENCE TO MEN OF LETTERS.
We observe that Mr. DUNCOMBE is about to bring under
the consideration of the House the subject of the enormous
incomes of the provincial postmen, MR. SCHOLEFIELD is
stated, by the Birmingham Journal, to have been intrusted
with a petition respecting the same abuse from parties com-
plaining of it in that town; where the letter-carriers receive
the exorbitant salaries of from 108. 6d. to 188., or even 20s. a
week. Obtaining these magnificent stipends, the whole of the
work they have to do occupies them not longer than from five
in the morning to six or seven o'clock at night, under circum-
stances of no more hardship than the salubrious and pleasant
variations of the atmosphere. They are thus inured to the
rainy day which, nevertheless, they can of course provide for
out of their ample incomes. These gigantic revenues have
of late suffered some curtailment from the prohibition to
receive Christmas boxes : nevertheless, their remuneration
must still appear excessive, when it is regarded as the price
of nothing more than honesty, sobriety, steadiness, and intelli-
gence, with the expenditure of a little muscular activity and
shoe-leather. When the preposterously high wages of these
lightly labouring men are contrasted with the miserable
pittances doled out to our hardworking bishops and indus-
trious pluralists, it will be obvious that some sort of alteration
must be made, to bring the former into something like
proportion to the latter.
Very Proper.

which was lately ratified between the British Government
and that of the Sandwich Islands, an express stipulation is

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
There are certain majors and other veterans, who on reading the
above will fling the newspaper across the room, and exclaim that they
never read such a pack of nonsense in their life, Sir! Concerts-fiddle-
stick! music for the militia? what should soldiers have to do with
music beyond the drums and fifes ? Reading and writing be hanged !

So far from agreeing with the majority-of old majors—in such sen-
timents as those expressed above, we of course only hope that the
Wilts Militiamen have really been entertained with good music, and
have received serious and solid instruction in military history, astro-
nomy, chemistry, galvanism, and electro-magnetism. We shall rejoice
to learn that the endeavours to teach them those sciences have been
made in earnest, and not in a mawkish and maudlin spirit of patronizing

ILLUSTRATED PASSPORTS.
SOME ingenious individual has proposed that every
foreign passport shall be stamped with a daguerreotype
likeness of the bearer. This project is intended to aid in
the detection of what may be termed the ugly customers
who travel abroad; but it would perhaps be easy to put
another and a false face upon the matter by a few touches of
the pencil. One great objection to the plan seems to be, that
the artists who get their living by daguerreotype portraits
would be ruined, if the Governments abroad should com-
mence the practice of issuing a passport with a correct
likeness included, for a few francs, to every traveller.
This is no doubt the age of Illustration ; and the idea
of bringing out passports with cuts may possibly tend to
give some little popularity to a system which has, hitherto,
been altogether unpopular. As nobody remains the same
for any length of time, and as illness may frequently alter
the features, it would be hardly fair to subject a traveller
to suspicion, because the light happens to have gone out of
his laughing eye, or the cheek that was plump when his
portrait was taken, may have sunk so low as to have
destroyed all resemblance. Should any case of the kind
occur, the Passport System will begin to assume a new
series of alarming features.

Training for the Church of Oxford.
EXERCISES for the degree of Bachelor of Divinity have
been announced as about to be held at Oxford. As that
semi Roman Catholic seat of learning must of course
desire to encourage clerical celibacy, it may be presumed
that these exercises are, in part at least, intended to adapt
the Bachelors to continue such. Accordingly, the Oxford
exercises for Bachelors of Divinity ought to include prac-
tice in sewing on buttons, mending surplices, starching
cravats, and ironing out bands; operations which they may
have to perform for themselves whilst they remain
Bachelors : and which they may not always be able to get
properly done for them if ever they marry.

DEATH IN THE JAM-POT.
The Analytical Commissioners of the Lancet have been dipping
their fingers lately into the preserve-pots of the Metropolis, and "Ohe,
jam satis !” must, we fancy, be the exclamation of everybody who
reads their Report. For, among other pleasant discoveries, we find it
stated,
“That the raspberry jam analysed contained a very considerable quantity of
copper. That the four samples of gooseberry jam examined all contained copper.
That copper, sometimes in large amount, was detected in 12 of the 14 samples of
orange marmalade analysed. That the nine samples of greengage jam were all more
or less impregnated with copper, it being present in considerable amount in five of the
samples. That the greengages contained in three different boxes of crystallised fruits
all owed their deep green colour to the presence of copper. That the limes and green-

colour to a salt of copper. That copper was detected in no less than 33 of the 35

COLONIAL CORRESPONDENCE “WASHED AND
DONE FOR.”
We understand that the Post Office authorities intend
shortly adding to their establishment an extensive drying
ground. This has become necessary in consequence of the
mail-bags being liable to saturation in leaky vessels, espe-
cially on their passage by steamer to Australia. It appears
that in despatching a letter to a Colony through the Post
Office we are in fact sending it to the wash, for the proba-
bility is that the communication, whatever it may be, will
remain in soak, till the vessel that is charged with it gets
to its journey's end, or what is more likely, puts back
again.
The newspapers have lately given an account of a scene
at the General Post Office, where the correspondence for-
warded by the Australian mail steamer was hung out to
dry, after the ducking it had experienced. Of course a
great portion of it was wholly illegible, as ordinary ink
will easily wash out, and common writing paper is soon
reduced by moisture to a pulp, but those persons writing to
the Colonies will in future do wisely to write their letters
on prepared linen, with indelible marking ink. We purpose
carrying on our own communications with Australia
through the medium of a few pairs of old stockings,
which we happen to have on hand, as they are no longer fit
to go on foot; and merchants will do well to draw their
bills of exchange on their worn-out shirt-collars. We trust
that every mail steamer going to Australia will be com-
pelled to carry a mangle and a good supply of starch, so
that the correspondence may be “ got up from time to
time, in a fit state to be sent home after the process of
washing. The whole of the letters should be hung up
occasionally in the rigging to dry during the voyage, and a
few active hands should be taken on board to do the neces-
sary ironing. The letters-such of them at least as survive
the soaking process—will probably be delivered in clothes
baskets, should they ever reach their destination; and
washing books will, we hope, be immediately supplied for

DYING BY DIET.

“MY DEAR PUNCH,
“I saw such funny thing in the paper the
other day-it was headed Curious Physiogical (I hope
I have spelt the word right) Discovery: It said that a
MONSIEUR ROULIN had been feeding silkworms with food
of different colours, and by that means making them spin
silk of the same colour as the food. And it also mentioned
that the very bones of animals may be tinged with what
they eat. Law! I wonder if it is the same with a human
being—and if so, whether it would be possible to affect
the complexion by food. It would be so nice to be able to
obtain a clear delicate colour that would wash, without being
obliged to resort to any of those preparations. And then
how funny to have it in one's power to be either a blonde
or a brunette, according to one's fancy, or as might be found
convenient--and perhaps to change from one to the other
if desired, or advisable. Can' you, dear Punch, or any of
your scientific friends tell me if there are any articles of
diet which have the power to make these alterations and
what they are ? for I should so like to know. I should

JULIA must not think about open jam tarts. The
effect of such delicacies in a complexional point of view
may be called pimplific. Julia is probably not disposed to
be blue; but that is the only tint which it is possible to
acquire by such means, as those to which she alludes : it
may be obtained by perseverance in small doses of nitrate

COLLOQUY ON A CAB-STAND.
(Adapted for the Boudoir.)
“Oh! WILLIAM,” JAMES was heard to say-
JAMES drove a hackney cabriolet :
WILLIAM, the horses of his friend,
With hay and water used to tend.
“Now, tell me, WILLIAM, can it be,
That MAYNE has issued a decree,
Severe and stern, against us, planned
Of comfort to deprive our Stand ? "
“I fear the tale is all too true,".
Said WILLIAM," on my word I do."
Are we restricted to the Row
And from the footpath ?" “Even so."
“Must our companions be resigned,
We to the Rank alone confined ?"
“Yes; or they apprehend the lads
Denominated Bucks and Cads."
"Dear me !” cried James, “how very hard !
And are we, too, from beer debarred ?
Said WILLIAM, Whilst remaining here
We also are forbidden beer.”
“Nor may we breathe the fragrant weed?"
“That's interdicted too.”
Indeed!”
“ Nor in the purifying wave
Must we our steeds or chariots lave.”).
“For private drivers, at request,
It is SÎR RICHARD MAYNE's behest
That we shall move, I understand ?
“Such, I believe, is the command.”
“Of all remains of food and drink
Left by our animals, I think,
We are required to clear the ground?
“Yes : to remove them we are bound.”
“These mandates should we disobey-
“They take our licenses away."
“That were unkind. How harsh our lot!"
"It is indeed.” “Now is it not?
“Thus strictly why are we pursued ?",
It is alleged that we are rude ;
The people opposite complain,
Our lips that coarse expressions stain.”
"Law, how absurd !” “And then, they say..
We smoke and tipple all the day,
Are oft in an excited state,
Disturbance, noise, and dirt create.”

publish false intelligence. A monstrous fabrication has.
ſately been committed by the British Press. The daily
and weekly newspapers have concurred in recording à.
case that (never) occurred at the Middlesex Sessions.
According to these deceitful prints, an unfortunate person,
one Mary Hill, aged twenty-two, was convicted of.
stealing a watch. MR. SERJEANT ADAMS, the Assistant-
Judge, asked if anything was known of her previous
character. The police officer concerned in the case said.
that she was the associate of reputed thieves and bad
characters, and that she was with a regular gang when
taken into custody :-
“The Assistant-Judge then sentenced her to seven years' transporta-
tion. The prisoner, who had gone down on her knees imploring mercy,
on hearing this rose up, and in a towering rage screamed out to the
policeman, 'You - pig, oh you - pig! You - perjured thief!'.
“ The Assistant-Judge: The sentence upon you nou is that you be
transported for ten years."
Such a statement as this is obviously calculated ta
occasion remarks which must be unpleasant to MR. SER-
JEANT ADAMS. Any one, believing it, would naturally be
inclined to say that the learned SERJEANT, not content
with administering the law, made it; improvised it on
the bench; that he had discovered a new crime, that of
abusing a policeman, and instituted a new penalty for it,
three years' transportation ; devising sentence for the emer-
gency: prescribing punishment pro re natá, as the doctors
say. At this rate, MR. SERJEANT ADAMS would be not
only Judge and Jury, but also QUEEN, Lords, and
Commons, in his own person; and therefore much too
many for the office which he so discreetly fills.
Our contemporaries really ought to be officially "warned"
to take care how they report the sayings and doings of our
Judges, and particularly those of MR. SERJEANT ADAMS;
and if they neglect that warning, their types ought to be
seized and their offices shut up, and their proprietors,

that they are obliged to scrape and save every sixpence they can to pay
dividends. That is why they cut down their expenses, in the first
place, and so cause accidents, and then grumble at having to pay for
the damage they do in the next. What is the remedy for all this? I

Hail! Gentle Cabman, modest youth,
Blest type of innocence and truth;
Where shall we find if not in thee-
The emblem of simplicity ?
Devoid of guile, thy softness rare
Deserves the very choicest fare.
In thee we happily possess
The paragon of artlessness.

ADVERTISEMENTS MORALISED.

NOISELESS WHEELS.
THERE is a rumour and a talk
Of an invention that's applied
Not to the use of those that walk,
But to the use of those that ride.
What is it to the public ear
In loud advertisements appeals ?
What do they speak of far and near ?
What makes this noise? The “Noiseless Wheels."
A subtle meaning may be found
Where 'tis not looked for by the throng!
A "noiseless wheel !” Thus, free from sound,
The wheel of Time revolves along.
No voice is heard to note its speed,
Silent and swift it onward steals :
'Tis only by its loss we heed
The flight of time—with “noiseless wheels."
Under the sun there's nothing new;
Whatever is, has always been :
Invention can but bring to view
Things that would else remain unseen.
The law of Nature-far and near-
The principle at once reveals ;
The world, the seasons, year by year
Go round and round-like "noiseless wheels."
The blood that warms the mortal frame
In circulation will be found;
The air about us does the same
In silent currents twirling round.
The head itself will often swim;
The brain occasionally reels;
And round will come the lot of him
Who's helped by Fortune's."noiseless wheels.
But Science may have miss'd its aim,
For clattering wheels are oft preferred
By those who think that noise is fame;
Not mute would be the vulgar herd.
Rare is the man his carriage owns,
Who modestly his state conceals ;
He'd rather rattle o'er the stones,
Than pass unheard with “noiseless wheels."

THE BELGRAVIAN VENUS ATTIRED BY THE GRACES, (BY AN OLD STUPID.)

HOUGH I'm now old and fat, and look heavy and dim,
I don't envy the bright-eyed, the young and the slim,
I enjoy watching Beauty and Youth at a Ball,
Whilst I think what a few years will make of it all.
Those exquisite creatures of Riches and Birth
Seem the children of classes superior to Earth,
With such joy in their voices, such smiles on their cheeks,
Like the happy Immortals adored by the Greeks.
Look at yon titled Maiden-that form is divine,
And the clothes she is wearing are suitably fine,
It is VENUS herself, an old Pagan might guess,
By the GRACEs attired in Olympic full dress.
But by no Nymphs, the daughters of ægis-armed JOVE,
The robes of that Goddess were fashioned or wove,
In an Attic, indeed, but no classical spot,
They were made-in a Garret close, reeking, and hot.
When Morn, rosy-fingered, appeared, or before,
Whilst the Goddess was snoring—such Goddesses snore-
The Nymphs of the Garret, the dressmaking Powers,
Arose from a slumber—perhaps of three hours.
From dawn till past midnight the needle they ply,
Oft till next morning's twilight appears in the sky,
With a pause for each meal-fifteen minutes, may be,
Their ambrosia dry bread, and their nectar weak tea.
A minute slice of meat, and potatoe, to these,
Add at dinner; at supper a morsel of cheese.
Toast and water 's allowed the first banquet to cheer,
At the last may be taken a small glass of beer.
But to check the somnific effect of the hops,
The sad Nymph must eftsoon imbibe China's green slops,
Lest she doze o'er the task, that her life must consume,
To make that CYTHEREA the belle of the room.
So I see, in the dance whilst our deity whirls,
Hov’ring round her the ghosts of poor milliner-girls,
'Twas those Graces that gave the gay VENUS her clothes,
And their spirits attend her wherever she goes.
Grim GRACES were such if young dandies could see
Through the spectacled eyes of a Fogy like me;
And should VENUS disrelish such haunted attire,
Ere she fix on her milliner-let her inquire.

THE NEW DECIMAL COINAGE.
THERE is no doubt that counting our copper
coinage by fours and twelves very often throws
everything into sixes and sevens-an inconve-
nience that would be avoided by making tenpence
into a shilling. A proposition to this effect has
been put forward, and as we are very glad to
make the most of our money, we shall be de-
lighted to hear that two shillings are to do duty
for half-a-crown, and that if we owe the latter
sum, we may pay the former in discharge of the
small obligation. There is some difficulty, we be-
lieve, as to names for the proposed new coins, and
somebody has suggested that a sixpence should
henceforth be called by the old name of a “tester.”
We do not see why the word “tester” is
entitled to any particular recognition, any more
than a "tanner," or a “Bob,” and indeed a
“Joey" would have an equal right to recognition
by Act of Parliament. If brevity is desirable, let
us carry out the principle to its fullest extent ::
let all our copper coinage pass indiscriminately
under the name of “Browns," and let QUEEN,
Lords, and Commons formally recognise as
“Tin” the whole of our metallic currency.

I said nothing; but I held my breath and bit my lips. To have my
affliction made sport of to my servant! Oh, all my happiness seemed
melting away like any sunset. I resolved to get up. "Yes; I would
wrestle with my sorrows out of bed. I rose; and after all, my face
was not so very bad. I might with a good thick veil confront the
world. Already I had taken resolution ; and when in anything like
a passion I can dress in a minute at most-and in a minute I was
dressed.
The landlady followed me into our sitting-room. Was so delighted
to see me look so well; and made such apologies for the gnats which
had come on purpose, she believed, to ruin her house, that I couldn't
in my heart abuse her. “What would I like for dinner? The gen-
tleman had ordered nothing. He only said, he might be late, but he
should bring home some trout. I had trout yesterday; would I have
trout again?"
“ Certainly not,” I cried, very angry. " And he said he shouldn't be
home till late ?"
“Why, ma'am, you know he can't if the gentleman walks all the
way; for it's eight miles at the shortest over the fields to Diamond-

this manner, and do nothing, the worm will never be allowed to
turn.” Now all these went, like sparks from a wheel, through my
brain, whilst I just looked at the landlady. “I can have a carriage ?"
said Í.
“Why no, Ma’am; I'm afraid not. To be sure there's the pony

“That will do. JOSEPHINE, put on your things. We'll drive to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI

A WAR CRY IN WORCESTERSHIRE.
EVERY now and then there proceeds from some little
hole and corner of the country a cry of defiance, a moan of
lamentation, or a shriek of alarm, which has the double
effect of surprising the rest of the world, and reminding the
aforesaid rest of the world that there is such a place in
existence as the hole or corner which the cry, moan, or
shriek-as the case may be-has proceeded from. A few
nights ago the House of Commons found itself listening to
a shrill shriek-echoed throughout the world in all the
papers on the following day-from a no less and no greater
place than Bromsgrove which, reference to a minute dot
in a map informs us, is in Worcestershire. The public-
after the first burst of astonishment at the intimation that
Bromsgrove is at all-will be curious to learn what can
Bromsgrove want, and why Bromsgrove has walked out
from its little dot on the map, to arrest the attention of
the world for a few hurried minutes? We should have
been scarcely more surprised had modest little Mitcham
attempted to seize the nineteenth century by the button,
and murmured out a few mild words about itself.
But what has Bromsgrove got to say? is the question
that now presents itself. Let Bromsgrove answer! or
rather, as Bromsgrove has run back again into his little
place in Worcestershire, we must answer for it. Well
then, Bromsgrove has petitioned the House of Commons
against a war between France and England! Has Broms-
grove been asleep since the peace of Amiens ?-and does
Bromsgrove timidly apprehend that war will break out
again ?-or has some ** mad wag” of the present day
walked into Bromsgrove to hoax it with the pretended
news of war being about to be declared immediately? At
all events, the petition from Bromsgrove came upon the
House with all the rococo air of a request to Parliament
not to sanction Catholic Emancipation, or to repeal the
Test Acts, or to do, or abstain from doing some other act
which has been disposed of and forgotten for half a century.
The only reply we can suggest to the prayer of Bromsgrove
is to send down all the necessary apparatus for a Com-
mission of Lunacy, with full power to inquire whether
Bromsgrove has or has not been in a sound state of mind,
and capable of managing its own affairs, from the day of
the date of its absurd petition.

SIR JOHN PAKINGTON. It is true that there is an offer,
made indirectly, to give the Rajah a character, should he
have anything else in his eye; for the letter says,
"In announcing to you this intention, I have to convey to you the
assurance of HER MAJESTY'S Government that they neither overlook.
nor undervalue the important services you have rendered in the form-
ation and establishment of this settlement."
The " valuation,” whether under or over, is evidently repre-
sented by the few weeks' wages that will be payable from
the date of the warning to the day on which it expires.
Something rather better than a month's salary is the extent
of appreciation set upon the “important services," rendered.

There can be no doubt that this "written character "
appended to the warning is intended to be useful to the
Governor, should he be a candidate for a situation in the
Police, or on a railway. Probably the Government which
gave him his dismissal may have thought that a great
favour was done to SIR JAMES by letting him know, in

HARMONIC RAPPING.
IF spirits can rap upon a table, it stands to
reason that they are also able to strike the keys
of a piano. The rappists should therefore extend
the range of their entertainments by adding a
BROADWOOD to their mahogany, and by, com-
bining the harmonic meeting with the spiritual
séance. WEBER, who was such a capital hand at
supernatural effects, and whose amiable character
during life renders it probable that his dispo-
sition is accommodating after death, would
doubtless willingly oblige the company with an
air or two from Der Freischütz, or Oberon, or
perform the overture to the Ruler of the Spirits.
The ears of the visitors might also be gratified
with a genuine "Ghost Melody : ” the effect
whereof upon those organs would probably be
to add, in a preternatural degree, to their

congratulated the old gentleman at so soon finding his daughter-as
if, having any eyes at all, he could have missed her!-told him, with a
laugh, how their lines had got tangled; at which the old gentleman
laughed like a whole playhouse, and said that in this world such
things would happen. And then the old gentleman-as if at last he'd
found me out—with twinkling eyes, and taking off his straw bat, made
a bow that ought to have gone like a dagger to the conscience of FRED;
but it didn't-not a bit.

at her—"a little too warm.'
“It is warm," said the old gentleman; "and so, Sir, without cere-

Well,” thought I to myself, “that's very kind; and we will go."
Not a quarter of a mile”-said MEG.
“We won't go," was my next determination. “Not a step,” I was
inwardly resolved.

day with us; and then return in the cool of the evening-we're all

MR. SPEAKER, - I pray, let us
Our feelings of purism high bury:
I wish we made less fuss
About Corruption and Bribery.
Fiddledy diddledy dee !
We are all birds of a feather, Sir,
To be bribed if 'tis roguery,
We are all of us rogues together, Sir.
My voter-if I bribe him
By giving his wife a yard or so
Of halfpenny ribbon, to trim
Her cap, or embellish her pardessus
Is not half such a flagrant case
As some-if the truth is confest of 'em
Who sit in Another Place,
With a Ribbon in front of the breast of 'em.
By an Earldom the Baron is bought,
And the Earl, in his turn by a Marquisate;
By a Dukedom the Marquis is caught;
And the Duke by some kind of a perquisite;
The Garter, we'll say, is the prize
That his Grace's ambition itches for,
And we know what price he ties
It beneath the knee of his breeches for.
By the Sovereign's favour, more
He is bought for political valet, Sir,
Than the fellow behind the door
That is purchased in Sovereign Alley, Sir.
For whatever you can afford
In this House, too, supporters are sold to
you;
As for instance, a seat at a board,
In the hope of which they hold to you.
A Place Market, and Office Bazaar,
We have here the honour of sitting in;
Hither gentlemen come, from the Bar,
Their mark expectation of hitting in.
That this is all wrong. I don't say:

That the pocket should here hold the sway
Which it bears in all human society !

IF, as a newspaper paragraph states, the prisoner Kirwan has been transported for life,
we should like to know what for? He was convicted of the murder of his wife, and con-

If the latter, we should think there is also some doubt that he ought to be transported.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

TEST OF SABBATARIAN SINCERITY.J
THERE are certain persons of the semi-Hebrew
persuasion who hold by the observance of Sunday
with the rigour of the Mosaic Sabbath, yet keep
their Sabbath on the first day of the week-ad
not, as Moses prescribes, on the seventh. These
demi-Jews, not content with abiding in their own
forms, endeavour to force others to conformity
with themselves, and are, accordingly, trying to
get the Crystal Palace closed on Sunday, in the
face of the non-Judaizing Christians of the
community. They must, however, see that if
laborious townspeople are obliged to keep one
day in the week holy-in the Levitical sense of
the word holiness—they ought to be allowed
for health's sake, both of mind and body, to keep
another day holy, after the ordinary manner of
a holiday.
Nature and Common Sense exclaim, that
working folks ought not to be cooped up on
their only leisure day, in the heart of London,
with nothing better to do, when out of church,
than meditate, like an unfortunate kind of
HERVEYS, among intramural tombs. Our demi-
Jewish friends, therefore, should agitate for the
establishment of a secular Sunday, in addition
to the regular one; and they would make a good
beginning of this movement by releasing all
manner of persons employed by them from labour
on one working-day in every week, and continuing
to pay them wages as before.

A HOUSE OF HUMBUGS.
VERSION to humbug of any description
has led MR. DRUMMOND into a speech
in which he plainly told the House
of Commons a “bit of his mind,”
and proclaimed the Government, the
Legislature, and the whole system,
from the Throne downwards, to be a
mass of bribery, corruption, and re-
gard to self-interest. Without “
cepting the situation" on the part of
the public, we must admit that the
House of Commons received the de-
scription of itself with a degree of
good humour that found vent in
frequent bursts of merriment. As
it is well that the opinion held by
one legislator of the whole legislative
body, should be placed permanently
on record, we have translated into
what will no doubt become “im-
mortal verse," the contents of a full
mortal column of the daily news-
papers.
You really are some of you stupidly nice,
Or, perhaps, you may think that JOHN BULL is an ass ;
He knows very well that you all have your price,
The higher the figure the higher the class;
With my derry down, hey! down derry.
It's true fifty shillings won't purchase a peer,
But, allow me to tell you what 's equally true,
A lord may be bought, be he never so dear,
For a few yards of ribbon-especially blue ;
With my derry down, hey! down derry.
Some seek for advancement, the more and the more,
Though the Government don't for their claims care a pin ;
But one who becomes a continuous bore
May finally manage to bore himself in ;
With my derry down, hey! down derry.
If the Ministry now may be said to be weak,
'Tis from shortness of places for little and big ;
The voice of hostility is but the squeak
Of some teatless, and therefore dissatisfied, pig.
With my derry down, hey! down derry.
Let bribery therefore go fearlessly on,
Let all opposition be put to the rout;
And this is my final advice to LORD JOHN,
Stop in-you 're a fool if you ever go out;
With my derry down, hey! down derry.

SOUND SENSE IN SINGING.
PROFESSOR AYTOUN, in one of his lectures the
other day, alluding to the circumstance that
Italian was the language exclusively used by
modern fashionable Syrens to sing in, appeared
to hint that English lyrical poetry might rather
advantageously be substituted. The suggestion
provoked a genteel smile from the PROFESSOR'S
titulary and ornamental audience. Of course. In
English song more is meant than meets the ear;
in Italian--present Italian--precisely nothing
more than just that. Nothing else is meant ;
nor is it desirable, to the Syrens in point, that
there should be meant anything else. The end
in view is simply to give the greatest possible
effect to the Syren's notes; every adjunct to her
singing is accordingly objectionable that in the
least tends to distract attention from the mere
tone of her voice. The less sense, therefore, in
proportion to the sound, the better; not to
think even of the expression of earnest feeling
or emotion, to which, besides, all well-instructed
young females of the superior class ought, of
course, to be superior.

to his own conscience.
Those unfortunate imbeciles who fancy the vestry a Parliament, are beginning to talk
about the influence of party, which is divided apparently into the "Old Orientals” and other
sections, named after the various public-houses at which they are accustomed to congregate.

likely to delude a lot of otherwise decent tradesmen into the idea that they are called upon
to manage not only the affairs of the parish in particular, but of the kingdom in general.
Already we are inundated with resolutions and debates by these suburban Cabinets upon

Night Lights are liable not to last the time that they

THE ROYAL ARMS IN DANGER.
It was with truly affectionate alarm that we witnessed the erection
in of a scaffold a little while ago in front of Buckingham Palace. We
began to fear that it might be again necessary that the Royal residence
should be permanently enlarged, to correspond with the recent per-
manent enlargement of that very popular periodical (every new number
of which is greeted by the nation with all the affection due to number
one)-the Royal Family. We should have been extremely sorry to find
that the comfort or convenience of the inmates demanded a further
outlay in bricks and mortar on Buckingham Palace, and we were, there-
fore, delighted to discover that the scaffold was only rendered necessary
by some repairs that were needed to the arms of Royalty. It appears
that the Unicorn had got something which turned out to be a sparrow's
nest-some believed it to be a mare's nest-in his eye, while the Lion
was suffering severely from the loss of the tip of his tail, which was
frost-bitten, and had crumbled off during the continuous cold weather
in April.
We are happy to say that everything which skill could devise has
been done for the noble animals, and the application of Paris plaster
to the Lion's tail has restored it to the proud position which it
ought to occupy. The Unicorn's eye has been cleverly couched,
and its cure is now a matter of ocular demonstration to every-
body. The wounds of the animals having been dressed, the interesting
creatures were supplied with an entirely new coat of whitewash, in
time to correspond with the new uniforms that will be worn on the
occasion of the birthday of HER MAJESTY.

THE BREAK-DOWN OF THE DERBY LOT. BY W. B.
(Late Whipper-in, and now ready for any job about the Carlton Stables).
It was in the Carlton Stables
And some upon the STAFFORD colt
RUSSELL challeng’d him o' one side,
As I was bred and trained;
The hodds did freely take,
And Wood upon the other,
At fust I served my time as vip,
A heasy-going nag he was,
Neek and neck then for a minute
And at nuffin never craned,
Springy and no mistake.
They were all in dust and smother :
And ven the ’untin season
As lively as a kitten,

In his gallops makin' play,
But it wasn't to be done;

He was lazy in his gallops,
Like the folks about our stables,
Didn't we just put the pot on!
And sulky in his walks ;
When it come to settlin' day:
For we'd ’ands as 'ad no ekal
An 'oss as on the British turf
We'd took the 'hodds like Britons,
At patchin' hup a screw;
Could never ’ave a chance ;
'Cos, in course, we rode to win;
And for turnin' coats of man or 'oss.

There was Brown and 'ARRY LENNOX; And some on us lewanted,

And cute OLD MACK, and me.
And some went to the bad :
An uncommon lively goer,
To make the other stables safe,
And the nastiest thing about it
Though his mouth was rayther 'ard ;
In course, it was our haim;

And Young ’ARRY LENNOX rode him best Blest if we stuck at trifles,
As went blowin' of our dodges,

And little stable jobs.

Both at the Corner and the Ring
And when they peached about us,
A pleasant thing to ride ;
We freely laid our blunt;
The Guv'nor, I must say,
But for DERBY Work, Lor bless you,
The race came hoff, the DERBY lot:
He didn't stand by the stables
He 'adn't it in 'is 'ide:
Got well away in front.
In a hupright, downright way.
I always told the Guv'nor
YOUNG BEN made all the runnin',
Wouldn't give us no charàcters,

Nor swear through thick and thin;
And he warn't; for he showed nowheres Waited on by JOHNNY RUSSELL,

LIVE LEGGED TABLES.
HEY! The world goes on improving,
Really, at an awful rate;
Now we've got to Table moving :
Quite absurd it seems to state.
People sitting round a table,
Hands conjoined upon it lay,
Presently, unless they fable,
It begins to spin away.
If mesmeric power is in you,
And sufficient force of will,
You can cause it to continue,
Disconnected, spinning still.
Am I sleeping, am I waking ?
In my boots or in my bed?
Walking on my heels, or making
Progress with inverted head ?
All discoveries this surpasses,
Which of marvel are a theme,
None will now remark, but asses,
“Wonderful invention, Steam !”
What will 't lead to that's a question
To be ponder'd on-because
It concerneth our digestion,
Which must rather give us pause.
At our dinner whilst we're sitting,
With vitality imbued,
Suddenly the board may, flitting,
Walk away with all our food.
Heedless of our prayer to tarry,
It may start, defying chase,
Out of window fly, and carry
Our provisions into space!

FLOWERS OF PROMISE.
An orchard in bloom in the sunny spring
To me is a wondrous lovely thing ;
The silver cherry, and creamy pear,
And the pure white plum Jook passing fair ;
But fairest of all is the apple, o'erspread
With its ladylike blossoms of white and red.
With strange delight on the scene I dwell,
It breathes a soft and dreamy spell;
Such magic as the Past can raise ;
It conjures up my early days,
When I learned to read in Nature's book;
And oft was wont, with earnest look,
On the flowery trees to stand and muse,
Whilst rapture would my eyes suffuse,
And I cried as the bright thought flashed on me,
“What a jolly lot of fruit there'll be!”

Campaigning at Chobham.
SOLDIERING, as about to be practised in the " Camp at
Chobham," appears likely to be not at all dry work. The
journals have announced that
“ Indeed, the locality is altogether damp, so much so, that an order
has been issued by the Commander-in-Chief, granting permission for
the troops to sleep on palliasses instead of upon the ground as usual.”
The military experience of the Chobham Camp will, at
this rate, probably include actual service in the face of the
enemy; as the forces will doubtless be attacked by
Rheumatism.

“BLESS US, AND (IF YOU CAN)
SAVE US!"
The French priests love to bless everything.
No fête, or rejoicing, or grand ceremony, is
complete unless a priest is brought in to bless
something or other. One day it is a flag with
fleurs de lis—the next it is a red--the day after
a white one, and so on through all the colours
of the political rainbow. One year blessings
are poured, like wine, upon trees of liberty;
the next the same fertilising shower descends
upon the head of the Emperor. When they
have nothing better to bless, they lay their
hands upon steam-engines, or heads of cattle.
Lately, however, there has not been much in the
blessing line; and we were afraid the Pope, on
his approaching visit, would have to quit Paris
without leaving a single blessing behind him,
excepting Louis NAPOLEON, and no true French-
man would look upon him in the light of one.
However, a grand institution has recently sprung
up, and the Pope, of course, will be called upon
to bless it. It is extremely lucky that Pius
will be just in time to bless the Guillotine! It
might be made the pretext for the grandest
fétes the Emperor has yet given, and we have
not the slightest doubt that it will. LOUIS

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

In three words I told her what it was my intention to do; to go
back some of the way at least-and search for the dropt money.
Coming in so late and going out so early, there might be a chance;
and I felt-though I said nothing—that the girl's dream of the
growing guineas (not that I'm superstitious, certainly not)-was
very promising
“But where's Master, Ma'am ?” asked JOSEPHINE, in a solemn
whisper.
"He's asleep," said I, with my finger at my lips.
“La!” said JOSEPHINE, “but you'll never go out without him?"
I nodded yes.
"Well, why not?” said the teasing creature—“why
not ? Ten to one, Ma'am, that he never wakes, and you may find the
money and come back and slip into bed again, and him never the
wiser.”
It was not a time to rebuke her-so I let her talk, the more so, as
the more she talked the more she hurried to dress herself. So I slipped
back into my room and I listened-I crept back again to the bed-side
- I looked between the bed-curtains—and positively, there was FRE-
DERICK just as I left him-fast asleep. I really do think I never dressed
myself so fast in all my days. It was not the work of five minutes and
-still he slept. I wrapped myself well up, and I was stealing out of
the room when I heard him wake. I paused-I crept back again to
the bed and-no, he had never moved; he was still fast asleep.
Suddenly wrapping my shawl tight about me-not that I felt hurt much,
---though I couldn't help thinking that I shouldn't have slept so under
the circumstances. Nevertheless, men-but, I thought, it's no matter.
I met JOSEPHINE in the passage. “La, Ma'am," said she, “if
nobody should be up! And upon my word, I do think, they keep a
big dog in the passage. If he should bite us—that is, if he should
bark and wake master!”
"Silly creature! I saw no dog,” said I; though I wasn't quite sure,
and quite easy on the matter.
FANCY PORTRAIT OF THE UNIVERSAL “FAVOURITE.”
Fortunately, the cook or housemaid, or somebody of the sort, met us
in the passage. “We're No. 10"-said JOSEPHINE with more presence
of mind than I thought in her-"going to take an early walk.” The
woman stared at us as if we were ghosts, and without saying a word

There was not a soul stirring. “You turned this way, Ma'am, I

The REGIUS PROFESSOR then presenteth to the CHANCELLOR the Doctors, clad in their robes, one by one, describing the merits of each in a brief
oration. As he leadeth forth the EARL OF H2RDWICKE he saith-

Post-Magister erat olim, ita est homo litterarum.
And as Ex-Post-Master General, man of letters sure must be.
The EARL OF HARDWICKE boweth and taketh his place among the Doctors. As he leadeth forth the EARL OF EGLINTON, he saith,
En EGLINTONUM nuper Hiberriæ Vice Regem,
Here is EGLINTON, the knightly, who so proudly and politely,
Riband æque ac Orange super manutenebat legem;
As Viceroy, late of Ireland, held drawing-room and levee;

A Tournament he once got up, which did not turn out so sprightly

As it might have done, because the rain came down extremely heavy.
Quâ re dignus est ut inter nos Doctoris induat vestem, Well he loves old ways, dark ages, and, in general, things gone down,
Vetusta qui sectamur, nova exosi tanquam pestem.
Wherefore Oxford hastes to greet him with an Oxford Doctor's gown.
The EARL OF EGLINTON boweth and taketh his place among the Doctors. As he leadeth forth LORD MALMESBURY, he saith-
En vobis ade Dominus Ex-Minister MALMSBURIENSIS,
Here's MALMESBURY with lady and leanings fresh from Paris,
Minister causâ nominis, non 'linguæ, pennæ, ensis !
Who of the Foreign Office, under DERBY, held the reins,
HARRIS est, erat HARRIS avus; hic similis est avo,
Not put there for wit or works, but because the name of HARRIS
Quantum inscius sollerti esse potest, tardus gnavo.
Once belonged to a diplomatist of more than average bruins.
Sæpe PRISCIANI caput, scribendo, conterebat ;
The name is still the same, but the brains they fled afar be:

grammar, and policy unversed,
Se jactat, “Thesaurarium sedile quot incessimus
He may boast that of the right bad lot who sat with my LORD DERBY

On the Treasury Bench last year, he was certainly the worst.
“Docendo” quum “discendum sit," -quod aït notus auctor 'Tis said Doctors by their teaching oft their business puzzle out;
Hic qui legum nihil didicit fiet optimus Legum Doctor.
If this be so, a Doctor he should be, beyond a doubt.
The LORD MALMESBURY taketh his seat cheerfully. As he leateth forth SIR JOHN PAKINGTON and MR. WALPOLE, he saith-
En nobile par fratrum ! Hicce domi, iste foras
Lo! a precious brace of brothers ! a Home-Sec. and Colonial ;
Rem agebat; id est, minas iste agebat, hicce moras.
One, with the style of head called “pig;” one, with no head at all;
Tu, Cancellarie, meditans e fumo dare lucem :
When DERBY thought of getting light from smoke, the ceremonial
Hos milites elegisti, hi milites te ducem,
Was ill suited for such wits, if "wits no wits 'tis fair to call,
Quam fortiter ultra crepidam ivit uterque, gnarum :
Sure never were two cobblers went beyond their lasts more cheerfuily;
Sit experientia doctus, Doctor Legum-vitandarum.
Doctors of Laws they ought to be, for their own lacked mending fearfully.
SIR JOHN PAKINGTON and MR. WALPOLE take their seats. As he leadeth forth MR. HENLEY and LORD STANLEY, he saith-
En HENLEIUM ! En STANLEIUM! Hic eminens prosator ; HENLEY and STANLEY! one who never gets his prosing fit out,
Ille, filius pulchro patre, hercle, pulchrior orator ;
The other his own father's son, born armed at point to speak;
DEMOSTHENES in herbâ, sed in ore retinens illos
A DEMOSTHENES that will be, though the Greek his pebbles spit out,
Quos, antequam peroravit, Græcus respuit, lapillos.
Whereas the heir of Knowsley keeps them rumbling in his cheek;
Hunc quem tu, Genitor, talem instruxisti oratorem,
You made him, my LORD DERBY, an orator to be,
Habcbis posthac Legum, tibi maxime, Doctorem.
And the laws he 'll teach you in return, when he is LL.D.
As he leadeth forth MR. HAMILTON, he saith--
En adest Ex-Secretarius, eheu! unus-quum tres numero One Ex-Sec., and only one! Ah! where is each brave brother ?
Secretarii esse debent; quas partes dehinc şumero ?
For A. S. and for W. B. its longing Oxford grieves.

But it may not be; I leave them, my feelings while I smother,

’Neath the veil of their initials, like violets 'neath the leaves.
W. B. non est inventus, purâ manu, corde puro--
'Tis not what you did grieves me, but found out like that to be!
Abest A. S. in presenti, erit Doct(i)or in futuro.
A. S., deserves to be writ down A. S. S., not LL.D.
Mr. Hamilton taketh his place, with a vacancy on either side of him. Here a flourish of shawms, sackbuts, psalteries, and other instruments
of Jewish minstrelsy. He leadeth forth MR. DISRAELI, and saith in a confused manner, as if overcome by the splendour and the
music that ushereth him in-
Verum enimvero-nempe--quando quidem-Di boni !
But-holloa ! hoy! what !-I say! Oh, my! Oh, goodness gracious !
Constringit oculos splendor, obtundunt aures soni-
In my eyes there is a flashing, in my ears there is a rumbling :

With praise just as unscrupulous a brazen-browed bes)ubberer;

For a customer all markets through hawking the precious foison.
