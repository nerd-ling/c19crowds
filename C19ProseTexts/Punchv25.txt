ON Christmas Eve, MR. PUNch, on the strength—or, rather, length—of a Message from PREsi DeNT PIERCE,
visited.her Majesty Queen MAB. He was received by a most courteous Dream-in-Waiting, who introduced
him through the Gate of Horn, whence, as Colon EL SIBTHoRP beautifully remarks,
“Veris facilis datur exitus Umbris.”
Dream-World was merrily keeping its Yule-tide, with shadowy Sports and dissolving Pastimes. As MR. PUNch
entered, the Game was
forfeits.
The LADY BRITANNIA was enthroned, Mistress of the Revel, and her golden apron was heaped with
Pledges. The owners, a miscellaneous group, awaited the sentence of penalties.
Down, at a smile-signal from the Lady in the Chair, down went the broad brow of MR. PUNCH, to repose
on her knee, while Kings, and Ministers, and Hierarchs, and Demagogues came rustling round to listen.
The magic formula was silverly uttered. “39;rt is a Ubing, amb a Łſtrp 3}rettp Qſbing, and &bat
shall be 7Bone by the QBſumtr of this £ſtrn QBrettu QIbing?”
“Answer, dear MR. PUNch,” said the Lady in the Chair. “You always say exactly what I wish said.”
“The Owner,” said M.R. PUNch, “will retire.” And the EARL of ABERDEEN, who had forfeited Public
Confidence, withdrew, and BRITANN1A murmured her intense satisfaction with the proceeding.
The next forfeit was called. “The Owner,” said the oracle, “will go down upon his knees, will, in all
abjectness of humiliation, beg pardon of all the world, and will humbly deposit his purse at the foot of the
Ottoman nearest to him.” A heavy tread, and the EMPERoR of All the Russias sullenly stalked away,
sooner than thus redeem his Honour.
The third forfeit. “The Owner will find a Lady, whose well-omened Christian name is Victoria,
and to her he will recite some verses, of his own making, in praise of Chobham and Spithead.” “I am

not much of a poet,” said MR. Cobden, “but if my Friend, BRight, will help me, I will gladly so redeem my
Blunder.”
The fourth. “A poor Foreigner,” whispered the over-kindly Lady, but MR. PUNch sternly buttoned
his pockets. “The Owner will behave with common honesty until further notice.” A gentleman in a Spanish
costume looked surprised at such a desire, and said that he did not care whether he did or did not redeem
his Bonds.
The fifth was called, and a light step approached, and somebody was heard humming a melody of ToM
MooRE’s. “The Owner,” said M.R. PUNch, “will carry three times through the chamber something to help
you, Madam, to hear your own voice better.” Lord John Russell smiled, and said that he hoped his Reform
Bill would so redeem his Promise.
And the Dream—it is dream fashion—grew confused, but MR. Punch thinks there was a scramble for
the rest of the things, and that everybody snatched what he could. MR. GLADstone, seizing, with tax-gatherer's
gripe, what he thought was a work on Theology, got “The Whole Duty—off Paper.” EMPERoR Louis NApoleon
departed very happy with a Cradle. LoRD PALMERston went out, angry with a Scotch Compass, which though
only just out of the Trinity House, had an abominable bias to N.E. Pope Pius ran about most uncomfortably,
apprehending the loss of a French Watch and Guard, to go without which would, His Holiness said, be his ruin.
MR. DisrAELI made several vain grabs at a portfolio, which BRITANNIA, laughing good-natured scorn, refused to
let him have; and when the EARL of DERby tried for the same thing, she presented him with a Racing Game,
as more suitable to his capabilities. Several Aldermen, who had presented specimens of Mendacity, received
packets of tickets, inscribed Mendicity, to everybody’s delight, and there was a cheer for a bold Bishop, who had
put down a Carriage and was content to take up a little Gig. Another Bishop—he had a Fulham cut—found his
mitre, but some one, in unseemly satire, had surmounted it with a golden and most vivacious Weathercock.
“And what would you put down, dear MR. PUNch,” said the Lady of the Revel, “if we began again f°
“This, dear Lady,” said MR. PUNch, gracefully bending, and proffering an object at which the eyes of
BRITANNIA sparkled like diamonds, “this—which—as your game is over, I will pray you to keep in pledge
that, six months hence, I will present you with its still richer successor.”
And BRITANNIA—the smile at her heart reflected in her face—accepted
łlt. #mt's Cutty-fiftſ tºlumt.

M. R. PUNCH
Y ES, with much pleasure,” said Mr. Punch, M.P. for England, as he
entered the Octagon Hall in Parliament Palace; and, in his usual
elegant and affable manner, extended his white gloved hand to a courtly
gentleman who had requested his presence.
“I was sure you would say so,” said the gentleman, and he raised a
finger. A watchful official at a door instantly turned to the electric
dial, and Mr. Punch's gracious assent was known at Holyhead, before
he had finished congratulating his companion, in the most truly charmin
§ on a promised knighthood, of which the Viceroy of Ireland h
whispered something to Mr. Punch.
“No man ever earned his spurs better than the man who has been
.."; railways into increased activity for so many years,” said
r. Punch, with a beautiful bow.
“I have not called you from the House at an unfortunate time, I
trust, Sir,” said the other. “Not that you can ever be spared, but—”
“WILLIAM GLAPSTONE is quite up to his work,” replied. the great
patriot. “He has but a couple of dozen of the Brigade, in hand at
present, and he is tossing up one after the other, cup-and-ball fashion,
cupping or spiking him to taste, with the precision of a RAMo SAMEE.
I can leave WILLIAM. Let us go.” - -
“You will take care that no other passenger is put into Mr. Punch's
coupé. guard,” said the gentleman, as the Euston whistle sounded.
“No masculine passenger, please tell him, MR. RoNEy,” said Mr.
Punch, facetiously. “Good night.”
“This Irish journey is jº done, certainly,” said Mr. Punch, as,
thirteen hours later, he found himself over his coffee and prawns in
Sackville Street, on a radiant morning, and all the bright eyes of Dublin
sparkling round the door of his hotel, eagerly glancing towards his
balcony. Mr. Punch rushed forth, serviette in hand. His large heart
beat high at the sight of so much loveliness, and at the sound of those
angel-voices, rising into musical cheering.
‘Bless, you, my darlings!” Mr. Punch could say no more, but
finished his prawns, and, throwing his manly form upon a jaunting car,
he dashed over the ºf: and to Merrion Square.
*An it’s for luck fºil be takin' your honour's sixpence, and not
for the dirthy money,” said the excited driver, as he rattled round
the corner, and into the Square, and the gigantic cylinders of the
ExHIBITION burst upon Mr. Punch's gaze.

“My Irish friend,” said Mr. Punch, gravely, but not severely, “do
not talk nonsense. Your carriage is clean, your horse is rapid, you are
civil, and your fare, is certain.., In, London, we have as yet neither
clean carriages, rapid horses, civil drivers, nor certain fares. We may
learn, those lessons of you. Learn, two from us. Do not believe in
luck, but practise perseverance; and do not call that money dirty which
is the well-earned pay of honest service. To sweeten the advice, there
is a shilling.” And Mr. Punch entered the Exhibition building, and
was drawing out his purse at the turnstile. But two #. olicemen,
in soldierly.. welcomed him with a respectful smile, and the turn-
stile suddenlyW. him into the building gratis, but a little, too fast

proceeded, and there was a sound as of a great rustling, as of a world

than#: face of one or other of his companions. They paraded the

on the platform, she pointed out that the forge and the loom and
the chisei had all been busy for that huge hall, whose area offered a
series of bold general types of the work to be seen in detail around it.
And China was near with her carvings, and India with her embroideries,
and Japan with a hundred crafts (now for the first time revealed,
thanks to our brother, the King of Holland), and Belgium with her
raceful ingenuity, and France with her artistic luxury, and the
lverein with its bronzes, and Austria with her maps, and flowers,
and iture. And then GRACE led him on to the Fine Arts Hall,
where the original thoughts of a thousand painters, new and old,
glowed upon him from walls which the Devonshires, and LANs.
Downes, and TALB9Ts, and Pontanuingtons, and YARPoRoughs, and
CHARLEMONTs, and others, had joined to enrich, with the choicest
treasures of their castles and mansions. Andamid the priceless display,
Mr. Punch felt justly proud of his aristocratic friends, who could at
once trust and teach the people.
HoNona bade him look from her, and they passed from an exquisite
Mediaeval Court, its blue vault studded with golden stars, crossed the
hall, and observed a long range of machinery doing its various
restless work, and doing it *ś thanks to a silent system and
a tremendous rod, sent from Manchester by FAIRBARN, through
whose Tubular Bridge. Mr. Pºnch had flown at dawn. And Honor,
showed him where Ireland had put forth her own strength, and thrown
down her linens and her woollens in friendly challenge, and with
her hardware, her minerals, her beautiful marbles, and her irable
typography. They ascended, and passing through long lines of gal-
leries, Mr. Punch's adorable guides pointed out, amid a legion of
wares, t more graceful and useful than he had seen assemb
since the bell (on that 11th of October last but one) tolled for the fall
of Paxtonia. .
“And now, dear Mr. Punch,” said HonoRA, “you have looked round
our Dublin Exhibition, and—and—"
“And,” said, GRAge, “* know that you sometimes say rather
severe thin about frejandº -
“Never,” said Mr. Punch, dropping upon his knees. “Never. But
here I ster a vow.”
The , whole assembly was suddenly hushed, and had Mr. Punck's
words been literal, instead of only metaphorical, pearls and diamonds,
you might have heard them fall on those boards.
“That for your, sakes here present, and for the sake of all the wise,
and energetic, and right-hearted men of Ireland who have to do with
this building, and with your roads, and railways, and schools, and the
like, I will henceforthwage even more merciless and exterminating war
than hitherto with the humbug Irish patriots (dupes, or tools), who

. A shout which made the good Sprº. John BEnsox's broad arches
ring again and again. And, as it subsided, there came forth from the
crowd of ladies, whose eyes all turned affectionately on the new comer,
a stalwart presence. Mr. Punch sprang up.
“This is your work!” he º “Don’t say it is not,
WILLIAM DARGAN, because I know it is, and because England knows
it too, and holds your name in honour accordingly.
That day's proceedings are º further. But all Mr. Punch's
friends who wish to please him will have the goodness to run over to
Dublin, and see the finest sight which will be seen between this and
the First of May next.
A NEW TURN IN THE TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT.
A.REAL, genuine, out-and-out Teetotaller says he likes this Table-
turning vastly; for, though it keeps folks to the table, still it kee
them from the bottle. “The table may go round,” he says, “but the
wine, does not circulate.” There may be more in this teetotaller's
chuckle than wine-bibbers imagine. We ourselves have heard an
instance of a wealthy City man, who is nearly as mean as the MARQUIs
of North MINstER, who spares his Port regularly, by proposing to his
company, as soon as the cloth is removed, that “they should try a di
little of this table-moving that is so much talked about.” The
decanters are removed, and he keeps his company with their fingers
fixed upon the º until, Coffee is announced... We warn all
persons who are in the habit of dining out, against lending their hands
to this favourite trick.
“Provided Always.”
Though, perhaps, not strictly within our province to attend to the
Commissariat of any but ourselves, we beg leave to announce that we
# undertaken to supply the whole of the Camp at Chobham with
chair.
The Author of Scotch BEER.—We lately read an advertisement
of a book entitled The Scottish Ale:Brewer. The author's name is
Roberts; but it ought to have been MacENTIRE,
CRYSTAL, NUNNERIES.
YE reverend Fathers, why make such objection,
Why raise such a cry against Convents' Inspection ?
Is it not just the thing to confound the deceivers,
And confute all the slanders of vile unbelievers?
It strikes me that people in your situation
Should welcome, invite, and court investigation,
As much as to * “Come and see if you doubt us;
We defy you to any evil about us.”
Form I think, if I held your persuasion,
That I should desire to improve the occasion,
And should catch at the chance, opportunely afforded,
Of showing how well Nuns are lodged, used, and boarded.
That as to the notion of cruel inflictions
nance, such tales are abundle of fictions,
Anāthat all that we hear of constraint and coercion -
Is, to speak in mild language, mere groundless assertion.
That an Abbess would not—any more than a Mayoress-
Ever dream of inveigling an opulent heiress, -
That each convent's the home of devotion and purity,
And that nothing is thought about, there, but futurity.
That no Nuns exist their profession regretting,
Who kept in confinement are pining and fretting; .
And to fancy there might be one such, though a rarity,
Implies a most sad destitution of charity.
That all sisters are doves—without mates—of one feather,
In holy º living together, -
Whose dovecote the bigots have found a mare's nest in,
Because its arrangements are rather clandestine.
Nay, I should have gone, out of hand, to Sir Paxton,
As a Frenchman would probably call him, and “axed 'un,”
As countrymen say—his ingenious noddle
Of a New Crystal Convent to scratch for a model.
Transparent and º inquiry not shirking, . -
Like bees you might watch the good Nuns in it, working;
And . their habits, observe all their motions,
And see them performing their various devotions.
This is what I should do, on a sound cause relying,
Not run about ºf. raying, and crying;
I shouldn't exhibit all that discomposure,
Unless in the dread of some startling disclosure.
What makes you betray such tremendous anxiety
To prevent the least peep into those haunts of º: -
People say there's a in your Convents—no doubt of it,
And you are afraid you’ll have Pussy let out of it.
CANWAS TOWNS.
Our contemporary, Household Words, has given an account of
Canvas Town in the new world, but we doubt whether a flººr. of
one of the Canvas Towns—or Towns under Canvas-in the old world,
would not reveal a greater amount of depravity and *". than
anything that exists even in Australia. A Canyas Town in #. 1s
no less bent ongold discovery than a Canvas. Town at Port Phillip-
the only difference being that the candidate's pocket, instead of the
earth, is the place that the electors or gold diggers are cºntinually
igging into. In the Colonies the inhabitants of a Canvas Town are
huddled together irrespective of rank, and frequently the best educated
rsons are found doing the dirtiest work, just as may, be seen in a
anvas Town in England before election time. The inhabitants of a
Colonial Canvas Town think only of the gold and the quartz, * as at
home the inhabitants of a Canvas Town think of not ut, filthy
dross and drink—the quarts taking of course precedence of the pints in
the estimation of the “independent” voters.
More Ormamental than Useful.
Mr. Disraeli calls “invective a great. ornament in debatº."
According to this species of decoration, B te ought to be the
most ornamental place of debate in the world; and Mr. Disraeli
himself, than whom few orators deal more largely in invective,
deserves taking his rank as the most ornamental debater that ever
was born.

to which they would have been exposed; and they arrived, after a º: march of
- that always lie
cha
nearly five miles, much harassed by the ginger-beer picquets and tramps
on the outskirts of an army.
It was, however, on the field, or rather among the furze-bushes of Chobham, that the
battle was really to be fought; and in the afternoon, the Guards, the 1st and 2nd Brigades,
with the Artillery and Cavalry, took up a sheltered position under a hill, to conceal them.
selyes from the enemy. This “concealment” was rather dramatic than real; for the enemy
had already determined hot to see; and as none are so blind as those who wºn't see, the “con:
cealment” was quite effectual. When the force had had full time to get itself º out of
sight, the “foe. poured down with immense, vehemence from Flutter's Hill, and began
squeezing, into ditches, or hiding, behind mud walls, to avoid, the “observation” of the
enemy, who knowing from signals where it was prºper tº look without the possibility of
seeing anything, kept up the spirit of this truly “civil” war in the politest manner.
The moment of action was now eagerly looked for on all sides, and Fº by our
old friend the British Public, who had perched himself on all the available eminences com-
manding a view of those who were about to give—and take—battle. Aides-de-camp were
now seen flying about in all directions with
breathlesshiº. delivering “property” des:
patches, similar to those with which the gallant
officers at Astley's are in the habit of pºgº
over the platformed planes of Waterloo. Sud-
denly the skirmishers of the 42nd made a sally
from the heights, and poured an incessant volley
of blank cartridge into the ears of the High-
landers; who, after one decisive struggle—though
we defy anybody to say what the gallant fellows
º: with—dislodged the foe, who had
on the previous day received regular notice to
uit their lodging at the time agreed on. The
uards now came on from the O. P. side, Upper
Entrance, of the Common, and turning back the

lessly over the set pieces under a heavy fire—
of nothing—from the muskets of the enemy.
Victory seemed hesitating on which side to
declare herself, when a rush of cav turned
the scale, scattered the weights, and upset the
barrow of a seller of sweet-stuff, who had incau-
tiously — as a camp follower–ventured too
near the flanks of the horse on the field of
battle.
. The mêlée now became general, and it bein
impossible to discriminate between friend an
foe, the Guards, seeing a large assemblage of
the public on Élutter; Hill, were immediately
“up and at 'em.” . This put the Hill in a more
than usual flutter, for the British public having

A BIT OF THE CAMP.
Mrs. Muggins. “WHAT' Fourteen on YE sleep UNDER THAT GIG UMBERELLER or A THING ! Get ALONG with YER!”
CHARACTER IN A BLUE BAG.
Two º quarrel about a matter of business; one of them
accuses, the other of trickery; the latter retorts on the former by
calling him a liar and a scoundrel; and the first attorney brings an
action for slander against the second. Whereon, according to the
report of the case:—
“The Lonn Chief Justice, in summing up, said it was not actionable to say of a
man personally, you are a liar,” or “you are a scoundrel; nor was it actionable to
combine the epithets, and say, ‘you are a lying scoundrel;' but, if said of an attorney
in his professional character, those words would be actionable.”
What the law-speaking by the LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE—means, to
say, is, that abuse, in order to be actionable, must be injurious;, that
to call an attorney a lying and scoundrelly man does him no injury:
whereas, calling him a º: and j, attorney tends to injure
him in his profession. The law, therefore, presumes, that you may
esteem a man to be a true and honest attorney, whilst in every other
capacity you consider him a false and mean rascal; so that you ma
be willing to confide the management of your affairs to him, althoug
you will not trust him with anything else.
It is curious that the rule applied to the defamation of lawyers is
reversed in its application to invective against legislators. Members
of Parliament are censurable if they impute falsehood and scoundrelism
to each other in a #. sense, but not censurable for making those
imputations in a Parliamentary sense. ...The theory of this anomaly
seems to be, that the affairs ºf political life cannot be conducted with.
out deceit and baseness, and accordingly that there is no offence in
accusing an honourable gentleman of evincing those qualities in
labouring at his vocation, that is to say for his country's good, for
which it is necessary that he should cheat and deceive.
The law of slander, partially applied to attorneys, ought perhaps to
be wholly inapplicable in the case of isters. If a counsel may
suggest to a jury a supposition which he knows to be false, and
particularly one, which at the same time tends to criminate some
innocent person; and if he is to be allowed to make such a suggestion
for his client's benefit, he is allowed to be base and deceitful for the
benefit of his client. To charge him with deception and villainy in his
character of advocate, is to accuse him of professional zeal; to advan-
º him, not injure him, in his business. It ought to, be lawful to
h him a liar and a scoundrel in a forensic sense, as well as in every
other.
THE HARDEST OF ALL SWEARING.
WHEN LORD BRough AM, the other evening, was presenting some
petition for the abolition of oaths, there were certain oaths in particular
which he might have taken the opportunity of recommending the
Legislature to do away with, They are alluded to in the following
passage from a letter signed CENsort in the Times :-
“As a condition of admission, the Head and Fellows of all Colleges are enjoined to
take oaths to the inviolable observance of all the enactments of the statutes. These
oaths, to use the words of the commission, increase in stringency and solemnity, in
roportion as the statutes become more minute and less capable of being observed.
These oaths are not only required but actually taken. Men of high feeling, refine
ment, education, and, for the most part, dedicated in an especial manner to God's
service, are called on suddenly to swear that they will obey enactments incapable of
being obeyed.”
Oaths such as these are enough to make any man turn Quaker-at
least by quaking as he swallows them; , Any amount of swearing that
ever disgraced a cabstand is preferable to such shocking affidavits;
and there is something much more horrible in the oaths of college
Fellows than there is in the imprecations of such fellows as coster-
mongers. Our army once “swore terribly in Flanders,” but never at
such a rate as officers of the Church Militant º to be in the
habit of swearing at the Universities; and although there is said to
be an awful amount of perjury committed in the County Courts, it is
robable that, the individuals forsworn at those halls of justice are
ar *.i. in number by the Reverend Divines who kiss the book
to untruth at the temples of learning. It is a strange kind of
consistency that objects to º: out an oath, and yet obstinately
retains such oaths at Oxford and Cambridge.

INDIAN FACT.
GREAT fact in India—nay,
why should we not throw
affected modesty on one
side, and say at, once, the
great fact in that, great
country—is the position oc-
cupied in the most flourish-
ing Indian communities by
our humble—pooh why
blink the truth—our noble
selves |
India is a country of
contrasts—of wealth and
want, of prosperity and
decay, of ind: endence and
servility, of self-government
and despotism.
THE GREAT
and Telinga, Canarese and
Tamul, Bheel and Ghoorka,
Khoond and Rohilla, Sikh
and Aheer—it will be seen
that we too have been gettin
up our India;-under &
sorts of authorities—Potails
and Zemeendars, Kardars and Jagheerdars, Ameers and Mokaddams, and
Deshmucks; with all kinds of tenures—Zemeendares and Ryotwaree
and Jagheerdaree. But the wealth, the prosperity, the independence,
and the self-government, are to be met with in one class of communities,
under one form of authorities, among one kind of holders only. These
oases in the desert of Indian native existence are those in which
Punch—the Punch—the Mr. Punch—in one word the Indian
*:::::. of ourselves—bears sway ! - - -
is remarkable circumstance—so deeply gratifying to us of course—
is no imagination of our own brain, no dream of our self-satisfaction,
no figment of any of our numerous flatterers and admirers; but an
historical truth, recorded in his distinctest and dryest manner by one
of the distinctest and dryest writers upon India—MR. CAMPRELL,
whose work has been much bought, much read, and unblushingly
cribbed from by pillars of the state in the House of Commons, and by
ing columns of the morning papers.
Hear then upon this great fact MR. CAMPBELL–of the Bengal
Civil Service—whose civil service to Punches in general, and Indian
Punches in particular, Punch is glad here to acknowledge. Hear
MR. CAMPBELL, on the nature, and effects of the authority, and
administration, of Punch in India. Where Punches preside, “the
system” he tells us “is infinitely better than anything we have hitherto
seen.” The revenue is larger and more easily collected; the condition
of the cultivator more flourishing; property more secure, and the
police better administered. Each village, under the beneficent and
º rule of its Punch, “is one community, composed of a number
of families, all, possessing #. in the soil, and responsibilities
answering to their rights.” Still Punch is no tyrant. “The Democratic
ch, has no offici wer or authority except as representing this
body of proprietors”—like ourselves, who have no authority except
in so far as we represent the people of Great Britain, which we flatter
ourselves we do in most things. -
-- Punch,” MR, CAMPBELL tells us §: 88), “is as a rule of
the#. number”—(that is, there are several contributors);-“a clever
well-spoken man, who has a Fº share of land” (we substitute
brains), “and is at the head of a number of relatives and friends”
(in Qur case, readers and admirers), “becomes one of the Punch,
which office he holds for life, if he continues to give satisfaction to
his constituents” (the public and proprietors are enough for us); “but
if he becomes Yery old, or incompetent, or unpopular, some one else,
probably, revolutionises himself into the place” (and serve the old,
incompetent, unpopular contributor right). “The office of Punch is
much coveted” (we should think it was), “and all arrangements are
by the Punch collectively” (if the gentle reader could be present at
one of our Saturday dinners, he would see what very small beer we
t of the Editor). , “They act not as persons having authority over
the community, but always as representatives, and on many subjects
they consult their constituencies before deciding.” (When did we not
consult public opinion, and when did we claim any other authority
than as representing the country at large?) “There is generally in
the village a, leader of opposition,” (poor creature!) “perhaps the
defeated candidate for the last Punthship ” (obviously a rejected
contributor), “who leads astrong party” (oh, dear no! MR. CAMPBELL,
you are misinformed on that point), “accuses the Punch of malversation,
and, sometimes, not withoutreason, of embezzlement” (not on this side
the water), “and insists on their being compelled to render an account
of their stewardship” (our º are open to all the world);
“for there are abuses and grievances in all corporations, in all parts of
the world” (i.e. “even Punches are not perfect”—a truth, probably,
though we trust we shall never exem º it in our own case).
Such is the rule of the Punches of H. a—and now for its effect. It
roduces communities, ...strong, independent, and well-organized.”
page 90). It is established over what MR. CAMPBELL styles “a
PERFECT ; community.” -
In short, º pf Punch is the only one MR, CAMPBELL is able
to rest of with entire satisfaction, as the model to which all the
other ye organizations of India ought to be, as far as possible,
assimilated. - -
...Tº every community its Punch, and India, would be some-
thing like what it ought to be-something like what England has
become since the rule of Punch was firmly established here-
something which would render altogether, unnecessary these dreadful
Indian debates, and the immense, amount of Indian "cram” which

“It would be something to say, FRED, that we’d been to France.”—
“To be sure,” replied FRED. “And yet only to have something to
say and nothing to show, is but parrot's vanity.”
.." But that needn't be... We might learn a great deal. And I should
like to see Normandy; if only a bit of it. One could fancy the rest,
FRED. And then—I’ve seen 'em in pictures—the women wear such odd
caps!... And then WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR-papa says tºe came in
with him; so that we were Normans once; that is on papa's side—for
mamma won't hear that she had anything to do with it--though papa
has often threatened to get his arms. And now I think of it, FRED,
what are your arms ?”
“Don’t you know?” asked FRED, puckering his mouth—well, like
bud. “Don’t you know?”
‘No, I don't ; ” and I bit my lip and would be serious. “What are
odd. And you are Normans! To
they?”
“It’s very odd,” said he, “ve
think now, IoTTY, that I should have made you flesh of my flesh,
without first learning where that flesh first came from. You must own,
my love, it was very careless of me. A man doesn't even buy a horse
without a pedigree.”
(I did look at him )
“Nevertheless”—and he went on, as if he didn't see me—“never-
theless, my beloved, I must say it showed great elevation of mind on
your part to trust your future fate to a man, without so much as even
a hint about his arms. But it only shows the beautiful devotion of
woman! What have arms to do with the heart? Wedlock defies
all heraldry.” -
. “I thought”—said I–“that, for a lawful marriage, the wedding-
ring must have the Hall mark.
“I don't think it indispensable. I take it, brass would be as binding.
Indeed, my love, I think according to the Council of Nice, or Trent, or
Gretna Green-I forget which—a marriage has been solemnised with
nothing more than a simple curtain-ring.”
“Nonsense,” said I; “such a marriage could never hold. Curtain.
rings are very well in their way; but give me the real gold.”

a covenant we can't be too real. Anyway"—and he took my wedding-
finger between his—“any way, Lotty, yours seems strong enough to
hold, ay, three husbands.”
“One’s enough,” said I, looking and laughing at him. -
“At a time” said FRED; “but when we're about buying a ring,
it's as well to have an article that will wear. Bless you,” and he
pressed his thumb upon my ring, “this will last me out and another,”-
“FREDERick,” I cried very angrily; and then–I couldn't help it--I
almost began to weep. Whereupon, in his kind, foolish manner he

“Let us, my darling,” said FRED, after a minute, “let us return
to our arms. Å. you came in with the Normans?”
“With WILLIAM THE CoNQUEROR, papa says, so we must have
arms.”—
... “Now I remember”—said FRED, as grave as a judge-'once, a
little in his cups, your father told me all about it. I recollect... Wery

tree at Battle—this your father told me as a secret; but as man and
wife are one, why it’s only one half talking to the other half—a tree at

tree, that.”
“I don’t believe a word of it,” said I.
“You must. Bless you”—said FRED–“ arms come by faith, or
how many of the best º people would be without 'em. There's some-
thing innocent in the pippin: besides it would paint well. And with
my arms”—
“Yes;” I cried; “and what are they, FRED:"
“Well, it's odd; we were--it's plain-made for one another. I
came from Normandy too.”
“You did?” and I was pleased.
“Yes,” said he. “I wonder what terms our families were on a
thousand years ago? To be sure, I came to England later than you;

these afforded the pure element, it would be all very well; but their
contents are much more suitable for the nourishment of plants than
for the refreshment of little boys and girls. Numerous and interesting
as are the yarieties of the animal creation contained in these Gardens,
the collection does not include that useful individual of the mammalia,
the common cow, to produce a drop of milk for the little ones..
Even if children could drink soda-water and cherry-brandy, it would
be, for many a father of a family which he takes to the -
Gardens for a holiday, much too heavy a disbursement to treat his
progeny with soda-waters and cherry-brandies allround. If the Society
cannot manage to add an ordinary milch, cow to their quadru eds,
they might, at least, establish the cow with an iron tail. They have
evinced great solicitude for the comforts of all the specimens of the
inferior orders of animals on their grounds; and doubtless, now that
their attention has been directed to the subject, they will make the
requisite provision for a very pressing want experienced by the young
of the genus Homo. With such a fact before them as the Camp at
Chobham, they would, indeed be inexcusable if they were not imme-

of Commons from its bed at the unseemly hour
of three in the morning, and seemed likely to
last until six. As the dawn broke, the gentlemen
of the gallery, wearied with the gesticulations

of MR. Connoodle, fresh as dew from the

up their note-books, and retired into their own

MltS. MAGNALL’S HISTORICAL QUESTIONS
(As they should be written for Young Ladies).
A History of England for young ladies remains, yet to be written;
The usual ingredients of a reign cannot be interesting to the youthful
female mind. Battles, with the number of killed and wounded; party
feuds, with the names of the ministers who succeed one another in
place; the slow march of public events, and the men who march slowly
with them; the eternal round of diplomatic and political relations—
which, as they never marry, are the last relations a lady cares for;
these, we say, are not exactly the subjects that would engage the
sympathies, or the attention of a young girl. What romance, what
possible interest is there in any one of them? No! we would change
all that, and have our English #. written in a style popular, easy,
and graceful, and alluding only to such subjects as ladies understand,
or can best appreciate.
Our proposal, however, will be at once *. by the nature of the
following questions, which we have extracted from a History supposed
to be written according to our sensible plan;–

| “THE SOLI)IER'S DREAM.”
(After T. CAMP-BELL. By A. CAMP-BEAU.)
WE were wet as the deuce; for like blazes it poured,
And the sentinels' throats were the only things dry;
And under their tents Chobham's heroes ini cowered,
The weary to shore, and the wakeful to sigh.
While dozing that night in my camp-bed so small,
With a Mackintosh over to keep out the rain–
After one glass of glog, cold without—that was all-
1’d a dream, which I hope I shall ne'er have again.
Methought from damp Chobham's mock battle-array,
I had bowled off to London, outside of a hack;
'Twas the season, and wax lights illumined the wa
To the balls of Belgravia that welcomed me back.
I flew to the dancing-rooms, whirled through, so oft
With one sweet little partner, who tel-dril-like clung,
I saw the grim chaperous, perched up aloft,
And heard the shrill notes WEIPPERT's orchestra flung.
She was there—I would “pop”-and a guardsman no more,
From my sweet little partner for life ne'er would part,
When sudden I saw—just conceive what a bore-
A civilian—by Jove-laying siege to her heart!
“Out of sight, out of mind!” It was not to be borne—
To cut her, challenge him I was rushing away-
When sudden the twang cf that vile bugle-horn
Scared my visions, arousing the Camp for the day.
Spirits above Proof.
It seems that DR. PAUL CULLEN and the Ultramontanists
have procured the rejection, from the lish National Schools,
of the Archbishop of DUBLIN's Ecidences of Christianiſtſ.
Hence it may be presumed that the “Leidences ...of ARcil-
bishop Wiiately are favourable specimens of W HATELY's
logic, and afford some really sensible and satisfactory reason
for believing in the Christian religion.
OUR HONEYMOON.
FRIDAY, MAY 24, 18–.
I AM not superstitious—certainly not; but when I woke this morning,
I felt as if something would happen; though, I said nothing to FRED.
With the feeling that came upon me, I wouldn't have thought of going
to France for wºrlds. I felt as if a war must break out, or something.
I knew it; I was certain of it,” said I, when l’d half read the letter
from home.
... In that case,” said FRED, in the most unconcerned way, which he
will call philosophy, whereas I think it downright imprudence—but I
fear dear Mamma's right; all men are imprudent—“In that case, we
might have saved postage.”
. “Now FRED, don't be frivolous. But I see, there’ll be nothing
tight at home till we get fairly back. Everything will be sacrificed.”-
“Is that your serious belief, my love?” said FRED, finishing his
tea; and I nodded very decidedly.—“Well, then, suppose we pack up
our traps and return to-day. And talking of home, you can't think,
LOTTy, what a present you’ve made me without knowing it.”
“Have I indeed? What present, love?”—
“It was in my . but then, it was one of those dreams that
always forerun the reality. Do you know I dreamt that we’d returne
home, and somehow when I tried to sit down in my chair, up 1 jumped
again; and so again and again. Whenever I tried to be quiet and stretch
my legs out at my fireside, I seemed possessed with a legion of imps
that would lift me from my seat and pull me towards the door.”—
“IIm ! That’s a very ugly dream, FRED,” said I; and I know I
looked thoughtful.
“Very: but it’s wonderful how, like a tranquillizing spirit, you
appeared upon the scene. I thought, my dear, you i,j Inore
beauviful than is possible.”—
“FREDERick l’—
“Not but what I'm quite content as it is. You know, my love, it
night have been worse.”—
“Well,” said I, “Mamma needn't have written to me that my
ºwn was nearly ended. It seems I’m not likely to forget
ſ/iſtſ.
“And when it was impossible for me to remain in the chair—when
I continued to get up and sit down, and run here and run there—then,
as I say, you appeared like a benevolent fairy-bearing across one, arm
what seemed to me a rainbow turned to silk; and in the other hand
carrying a pair of slippers.”
“Well; and then?”—
“And then, with a thought, I had put on the morning-gown;-
for it was that you carried-and placed my feet in the slippers. There
never were more beautiful presents; never richer gifts for a wife to
make her husband. For would you think it, Lotty P No sooner
had I wrapped the dressing-gown about me, than I became settled in
the sweetest repose in my chair; and the very walls of the room
seemed to make the soſtest music. And then the slippers! ... Most
wonderful I Would you believe it, Lotty—wherever the slippers
touched, a flower sprang up; flowers and aromalic herbs! The very
hearth seemed glowing ...”odorous with roses and thyme. But then,
you know, it was only a dream, Lotty. There's no such dressing-
gown—and in this wºrld no such slippers;” and then-I could see
it—he looked in his odd way at me.
“I suppose not, FRED,” said I; for I wouldn't seem to understand
him. “ %. then, if such slippers could be found, where's the
lº feet to fit 'em 2 *T would be another story of the glass
slipper.”
Pºio knows when we get home? But what's happened?”
he pºinted to the letter.
“Well, then, the pigeon-house has blown down; and Rajah's flown
away; and a strange cat has killed the gold-fish; and, in fact, FRED-
as dear Mamma writes to me; not, as she says, she’d have me worry
myself about the matter—in fact the house wants a mistress.”
“I have no doubt your excellent mother is right,” said FRED; “and
as you won't go to France, suppose we make way for. The Flitch. Do
you know, Lotty, I'm curious to know if—after all—those slippers
mayn’t be found there.” -
“I’ll take care of that,” said I; “but you know, FRED, we can't go
back yet.” -
-- hy not ?”—
“Why, you know our honeymoon isn't quite out; and ”-

talk. Of course, ’t would be said we were tired of our own society,
and so got home for company. - -
“Nevertheless,” said FRED; “you take the flight of Rajah, that
dear bird, with wondrous serenity.”.
And it then struck me that I did not feel so anno
“Ha, FRED,” said I, “you don't know what my feelings may be;
don't misjudge me because I don't talk. I can assure you, I am very
much disturbed;” and I was vexed.
“Perhaps, then"—said FRED-"you'll take a little walk towards
the Steyne; and recover yourself? I’ve some letters to write, my
love; and—"twill do you good—I'll join you.”
“Certainly ”—said I-" of course; if you wish it,” and then I
wondered why he should wish to get rid of me. It never happened
before, Yes—and the thought came again rerº fºrcibly upon me; it's
lain the honeymoon's nearly out; and then I left the room; and as I
}. it, didn't I nearly bang the door?
“Why should he wish to get rid, of me?” ... I seemed quite
bewildered with this question. Everything seemed to ask it... He
could have written his letters without my leaving the house. How-
ever, I felt glad that I contained myself; and especially glad that I
didn't bang the door.
Well, I ran and put on my bonnet; and then just peeping in at the
door to FRED, said, “I’m going; ” and in another minute was taking
my way towards the Steyne. it was such a beautiful day; the sky
so light; and the air so fresh and sweet, *I*. in a little minute,
my bit of temper had all, passed away—and did well scold myself
that, for a moment, I had entertained it... I walked down upon the
beach. ... Scarcely, a soul was there: and I fell into a sort of dreamy
meditation—thinking about that morning-gown and those slippers.
“I’ll get ’em for "Fiºn, that I will; ” I resolved within myself.
“Roses shall grow at the fireside; and repose shall be in his arm-
chair. That I’m determined:” and as I resolved this with myself,
everything about me, seemed to grow brighter and more beautiful.
And then I wished that we were well at home, and the slippers had
for once and all, been tried and fitted. The gulls flying about reminded
me of Rajah ; and I did wonder at myself that, I could think of his
loss—that would have nigh killed me at one time—so calmly. But
then, as Mamma said, as I’ve since discovered,—it's wonderful
what other trifles marriage makes one forget.
There was nobody upon the beach ; so I sat down, and began a day-
dreaming. How "...# we should be at home, and how softly and
sweetly all things would go with us! And still, as the waves ran and
burst in foam upon the beach, I thought of the slippers.
I hardly knew, how long I’d been there, when a little gypsey girl
stood at my side, offering a nosegay; I looked and—yes, it was one
of the ies, at whose tent FRED and I took, shelter in the thunder.
storm. However, before I could say a word, the little creature dropt
the nosegay in m *}; and º, ran away; . -
Such a beautiful bouquet / Had it been a thing of wild or even of
common garden flowers—but it was a ſququet of exotics—and how
were gypsies to come by such things? Then something whispered to
me—"stole them.” - -- - -
I didn't like to throw the thing away; and as I remained meditating,
FRED came up. “Pretty flowers, Lotty,” said he.
“Yes; selected with taste-great taste, an’t they?” said I; and I
cannot think what whim it was possessed me to go off in such praise
of the bouquet.
“Pretty well,” said FRED. -
“Pretty well! my dear FRED ; if you'll only look and attend, you'll
own that the person who composed this bouquet must have known all
the true effect of colours.”
“Indeed,” said FRED; as I thought very oddly; so I went on.
“Every colour harmonizes; the light, you see, falling exactly in the
right place; and yet everything arranged so naturally—so harmoniously.
The white is precisely where it should be, and "-
“Is it truly f" and saying this, FRED twitched from among the
flowers a note that like a mortal smake as I thought it lay there.
“Why, it's a letter!” I cried.
“It looks like it,” said FRED. -
“It was brought by a gypsey,” said I; and I felt my face burning,
and 1 could have cried... “It’s a mistake.” .
“Of course,” said FRED: “what else, my love? Of course, a
mistake.
And then he gave me his arm, and we returned towards the Inn,
FRED ºf: and talked; but somehow I felt so vexed: yes, I could
have cried; and still FRED was so cool-so very cool.
Another Change in France.

THE BREAKSPEARE TESTIMONIAL.
According to the Athenaeum, a Cardinal's hat is about to go round—
in obedience, however, to no new force or principle. Our learned con-
ed as I ought. temporary says:-
“There has been only one English Pope, and of him there hnº been hitherto no
public monument in the º over which he ruled. The omission is now, it seems, to
be rectified. A committee has been formed with a view to collect subscriptions; Pio
Noxo has given his blessing, CAudixa L. Altıkki his countenance, and CARDINAL
| Wisemax has received instructions to collect the money in this country. . . The
sum named for the monument is £6,000 . . . A magnificent memorial is to be
erected to him in St. Peter's. The attempt to elicit such a declaration in England at
such a time is a clever trick enough ; and in order to its success, one of the grounds of
appeal to the pockets of Englishmen shows a profound knowledge of the weak side of
our national character. Wherever John Bull wanders, it has been observed that he
carries with him a passion for recording his autograph. The 13howns, and SMIt us,
and Joneses write their names on the Pantheon and Pyramids, temple and tomb. The
Cardinals have had the wit to make a direct appeal to this passion; they offer to
inscribe the name of every donor of £60—which they are willing to receive in monthly
| instalments of 20s.-on the base of the monument of Pope Nicholas Burakspeal.E.”

PUNCH AT A ROYAL CHRISTENING.
It is not often that Punch has to protest against anything that |
happens at, our own Court, but, unless the Court Newsman has
misinformed us, there was something very objectionable in the pro:
çeedings at Buckingham Palace on the occasion of the last Royal
Christening. Recollecting that the Sponsors promise in the name of
the infant to renounce “the pomp and glory of this world,” we cannot
help asking whether the following description of what took place is not
lamentably at variance with the spirit of the promise that was given;–
“The sacred rite was performed in the private chapel in the Palace, which was
duly prepared for the ºccasion. Two rows of chairs of crimson satin and gold were
placed on each side of the centre, for the use of the Qurex, the Sponsors, and the Royal
personages invited to be present.” - -
This might pass as coming under the head of luxury rather than of
pomp, but what shall we say to the next paragraph?—
“The altar was lined with crimson velvet, panelled with gold lace, and on the
communion-table were placed the golden vessels used in the Sacrament, with salvers
and two large candlesticks. , Seats of crimson and gold were placed for the officiating
clergy. . The font was placed in advance of the haut pas; it was a most elegantly formed
tazza of silver gilt, the rim was formed of the leaves and flowers of the waterlily, and
the base from which its elegant stem sprang was composed of infant angels playing
the lyre; in the front was the Royal arms. The font was placed on a fluted plinth of
white and gold.”
Riches, we are taught, add to the difficulty of entering the Kingdom
of Heaven, then why this profusion of gold to encumber the first step
of a Royal infant on his entrance into the Church which is to secure his
eternal happiness?... “Gold lace,” “golden vessels,” and seats of
“crimson and gold” for the clergy, are scarcely the appliances that
would seem appropriate to the ceremony of receiving the “sign of the
cross,” which is certainly, not typified by any of the accessories of
}. and splendour that abounded on that occasion. Surely this must
ave struck on the mind of some one or more of the assembled grandees,
who, if not too much wrapt up in the idea of their own and the sur.
rounding grandeur, may have remarked that
s .. the altar was a fine piece of tapestry representing the baptism of our
Saviour.”
If the tapestry told the truth, there would be no clergy, in gold
seats; no font appropriated to Royalty by a vulgar display of the Royal
arms, over the front of it; and no infants or any one else “playing the
lyre’ at the simple solemnity, of which a Royal Christening is but a
gaudy mockery. -
As a further assistance to the infant in renouncing the pomps and
vanities of the world, we find that
"The Heralds and Kings of Arms were on duty to usher the distinguished personages
tº their places in the chapel, and conduct the Royal processions. There were present
Almºhr William Woods, Esq., Lancaster Herald; WALTER Aston Boust, Esq., illi
Chester Herald; JAMEs PULMAs, Esq., Clarenceux King of Arms; Robert LAuriº,
Esq., Norroy King of Arms; and Sin Chamles George Youro, Garter Principal
King of Arms; the whole wearing their splendid tabards, and the Kings of Arms their
distinctive insignia.”
It is really sad to think that in an age which prides itself on common
sense, and at a Court confessedly adorned by the many virtues of the
Sovereign and her family, conventionalism still holds such sway, that
one, whºm it is no flattery to call an ornament to her high position
still feels herself under the necessity of converting a solemn religious
ceremony into a vulgar display of luxury and vanity. Can it be
supposed that the admission of the #. infant into the Christian
flock required the assistance of archbishops, bishops, and clergy on
seats of crimson and gold, the presence of Heralds and Kings-of-
Arms, a whole bundle of Gold and other Sticks, the Master of the
Buckhounds, and the whole hue and cry of Court “pride, pomp, and
circumstance;” which, however appropriate to some occasions, are
utterly at variance with the admissiºn of an infant to . religion for
which humility is one of the chief requisites?
The Court is justly looked to in this country as an example; and the
QUEEN, as mother, wife, and woman, is indeed one whom all would do
well to imitate. For this reason we stillmore regret the recent display
which will set all the servile crew of imitators to work to emulate, as
far as they can, the }. and vanities of a Royal Christening. The
influence, will extend down to some of the humblest ranks of society,
and we shall have the Herald and the Post full of accounts of how
MRS, JøNEs of Jonesville had the altar decorated, the Bishop got
up, the font covered with the arms of Jones, and all the appliances of
Royalty aped at the baptism of the JonesiAN infant.

Twe trust HER MAJESTY will use her own good sense, and release all
future Royal Christenings from the trappings of pomp and vanity with
which guston has hitherto entangled them. We must say, in conclusion,
that Her MAJESTY is not, responsible for all the pompous foolery
against which we have raised our yoice, for it has been customary long
before she came to the throne, and she has, in many instances, had the
courage and good sense to abolish many empty observances. e hope,
on the next occasion of a Royal Christening, to find her §erº;
own proper feeling in divesting the occasion of all those forms which
arc at variance with its spirit.

SPIRITUAL MANIFESTATIONS GOING A-HEAD !
Rev. GLENDoweR S. FIRBs, of Salem, U.S., has been induced, by
the extensive interest taken º the British aristocracy in the
SPIRITUAL MANIFESTATIONs which have lately been, introduced from
America, to visit this country with a view to the exhibition of Occult
PHENoMENA, on a scale which, owing to the prevalence of an
illiberal spirit of persecution, has been hitherto unattempted in this or
any other country since the era of Egyptian magic. He is accompanied
by three Actually. Possessed MEDIUMs, who will utter responses,
and afford correct information on doctrinal subjects, under the influence
of SPIRITs. He has also, at the expenditure of a considerable sum,
secured the co-operation of a genuine Wizard and Witch from
Boston, Mass., who will prove the REALITY or SoRCERY and MAgic by
Ocular DEMONSTRATION, to the satisfaction of the most incredulous
and determined scentic.
The Wizard will evoke the SriRIt of any DECEASED PERson who
may be agreed upon by the Party Assembled, and compel it to appear
in a visible form before the eyes of the Spectators, deliver predictions,
&c. The Witch will perform the much controverted, but undeniable
and surprising feat of RIDING ON A BRoomstick; and to illustrate the
power of SoRCERY over the elements, will raise a Tempest on a small
scale by BREWING A StoRM in a Tea-pot. She will also exhibit the
marvellous PHENQMENA of TRANSFORMATION, by changing herself
successively into the shape of yarious animals: after which she will
summon her FAMILIARs, in the form of CATs, Toads, and SPIDERs, and
finally, together with her ATTENDANT IMPs, VANIsh Up THE CHIMNEY.

THE KEY TO THE RUSSIAN QUESTION.
T seems after all that the
eat casus belli between the
orte and Russia is “Who
shall keep the key of the
Greek Church?” The contest
is to determine whether the
key in question shall dangle
on the watch - chain of the
Greek, or hang on the bunch
with the street door and other
keys of the Latin patriarch.
We might as well allow the
EMPEROR OF CHINA to inter-
ſere with us, and insist on .
inting a protector of Temple
ar, for |. purpose of de-
ciding whether the QUEEN or
the ſolu, MAYok shall have
the custody of that rusty old
myth, the Key of the City. It
is absurd, and yet awful to
think, that all Europe should
be kept on the qui tire about
a key of no real value, and
ºl. in fact, nobody cares
about.
We think we can furnish a
key to , the whole difficulty,
- int, the way to a pacific solution of the questiºn by
É.; the affair into the hands of our friend Chubb of St. Paul's
hurchyard, or our equally enlightened friend BRAMAll of Piccadilly;
We are convinced that either of these ingenious individuals will
undertake to dispose of the question, “Who shall keep the key? ” by
furnishing each party with a duplicate. By this, arrangement either of
the individuals claiming custody of the key will have it in his power to
avoid the necessity of either picking the lock or picking a quarrel.

“A member of my family is just recovering rom an illness which, for a time, kept
all about her in daily apprehension. The fact of the illness becoming known in the
neighbourhood, I am forthwith inundated with undertakers' circulars, in which all the
horrid paraphernalia of the tomb are set forth, together with the various merits,

shamelessly, indecently, wantonly, thrust before the very eyes of afflicted relatives

Precisely as the light in the sick chamber elicits the shriek of the

death-hunters combine the propensities of the crow, and the Yulture,
which repair to the spot whereon a creature, is dying, and, hover
impatiently about their prey that still breathes. Occasionally, no
doubt, the vultures and crows, by a premature bite or dig of the beak,
expedite the process of dissolution, and very likely the other birds of
prey not unfrequently do the same thing: for one of these undertakers'
circulars getting, by the folly of an old nurse, or any other misfortune,
into the hands of a person dangerously º, would be extremely likely
to occasion a fatal shock, and convert the expected corpse into an
actual one. .

senders of these, disgusting handbills, and informed the sordid and
unfeeling snob that in case, the services proſtered by him were ever,
unhappi }: required, he would undoubtedly not be employed to render
them. It is to be hoped that the determination expressed by this
gentleman will be strenuously acted on by º else: and that

circumstances, he will, instead of flinging it in a rage behind the fire,
carefully preserve it, for the purpose of showing it to all his acquaint-

such an odious brute.
Mind, however, that if you will associate sepulture with upholstery,
you must expect to have upholsterers looking to sepulture with mere
upholsterers' feelings. You ought not to be surprised that undertakers
speculate on the prospect of a job at your house. It should not
astonish you if one of these gentry were to propose, to measure your
wife or child for a collin. If your funerals must needs be “furnished,”
your, funeral, furniture will involve competition, and, its incidental
snobbisms. Put away, the soul's old clothes in a plain box, with
decent rites, and no other ceremony. Deposit them where they may
most conveniently decompose, and deposit as little as possible of any
value to decompose with them. Why should it cost a considerable
sum to put a small !. of organic framework into earth? Whilst
that operation nues to be expensive, we shall be sure to be
pestered by candidates for its performance, invading the very chamber

THE GREAT CAB REFORM.
ArtER several years of grumbling on the part of the public, we
have at last, got a Government that has been “strºng enough” to
yenture on what, in the highly intelligent circles, of Downing. Street,
has hitherto been considered the “hazardous question” of Cab Reform.
It is a positive fact that until MR. FITzRoy took the matter in hand,
every administration has been “afraid” of the introduction of a Qab
Bill, lest it should have opened the door to opposition, or, in other
words, the public were to be crammed into wretched cabs, lest the
Cab-in-et should be turned out.
Ever º with half a grain of common sense was perfectly well
aware that Cab Reform would be one of the most popular things a
Government pould undertake; but, it has required, several years to
ake this plain fact intelligible in high quarters; and even now, there
been a timidity in dealing with some portions of the subject of
Cab Reform, which, though the new Act is very good, as far as it goes,
will soon cause the public to complain, We, however, desire to give
all praise where it is due; and especially to $ſ. FitzRoy, who will go
down to posterity with his aggravated Assaults' Act in one hand, and
his Cab Law in the other, to say nothing of the County Courts'
Measure sticking out of his pocket. The sympathy shown by the
resent Government towards, riders in cabs affords a proof that we

INSPECTION OF CAVALRY BY GENERAL PUNCH.
MAJOR GENERAL Pusch º: this day for the inspec-
tion of the Queen's Piebalds, that gallant and distinguished corps
arrived at Chamomile Scrubs at 9 o'clock in full marching order, and
formed line with rear to the railway, to await the arrival of the General.
The inspections of the General are generally looked forward to with
much interest by the cavalry, in consequence of their practical mature;
and this being so close upon the Chobham affair, a considerable amount
of cramming had been practised by the subalterns, who had given up
their days and nights to the getting up of their “echelons,”, “wheels,”
&c., and the otherinteresting information afforded by the book published
by authority of the Adjutant-General.
The General arrived shortly after the troops, and immediately pro-
ceeded to business. He first inspected the ranks; and having ascer:
tained (as indeed, had been ascertained before, in “troop,” “squad,”
and “grand parade”) that the men's hair was cut according to the
regulations, that the whiskers were in line with their ears, and that
their “boots were polished and jackets were trim,” he made a minute
inspection of the appointments, Fº out the mode of fastening the
carabine as giving ample room for improvement. The pouch, he was
particularly, displeased with, asking somewhat snappishly, What the
devil it did at the back when it was wanted in the front? He also
made some observations about the cartridges, blank as well as ball,
which we couldn't catch. The regiment then marched past by squadron,
files, troops, threes, &c. While ranking past by single file—a movement,
by the bye, which is particularly slow in more senses than one—the
neral tººl the subject of the appointments, and paid particular
attention to the valise, and mode of º: it; but as his observations
were repeated in an after part of th
them. -
The sword exercise was next performed in a manner which did great
credit to the adjutant. Indeed the pursuing }*. at a gallop, was
particularly exciting; the troops scouring the Scrubs in pursuit of
nothing, with a zeal and vigour which must have struck terror into the
heart of Nicholas, or even his illustrious namesake himself, had either
witnessed the scene.
The evolutions next commenced, GENERAL Punch himself giving
e day, we need not here insert
the word of command—the practice he always adopts at his inspections,
in order to prevent the possibility of commanding officers gramming
their troops with a series of common-place movements. . However,
things went off very well, notwithstanding. While the skirmishers were
out the General took the opportunity of again pointing out the great
inconvenience, not to say the utter uselessness of the pouch, which
article of war, by the bye, he seems to be properly “down upon.” It
was noticed indeed that nearly all the skirmishers dispensed entirely
with its use, º their ammunition in their breasts, or rather, in
the breasts of their coats. The gallant General galloped about from
flank to flank with great fury, “dressing”, the line and the leaders
with a micety which must have greatly pleased the adjutant. The
manner in which he shouted “U”, up, up, up the l-l-left 1" “Back the
r-r-right !” must also have been tonally approved of by that officer.
On returning to barracks, the General went round the stables,
attended by the Colonel and the officers of their respective troops. It
is this part of the day's business that always causes the “funking” (if
we may be allowed to apply that term in military matters) of the
officers. The General being well “up” in all the minutiae of stable
economy, mostly puzzles the officers with his curious information
respecting straps, buckles, wallets, shoe-cases, &c., a sort of informa:
tion which, though it may be thought “ boring” to acquire, and
º it may seldom be necessary for officers to apply in quarters,
would be found very essential in actual warfare, or at Chobham, where
it was not unlikely an officer might be left without his “batman,” and
have to shift for himself.
We give aspecimen of the sort of information required by the General
of these affairs, premising however that he does not select an individual
officer, and subject him to a lengthened catechism; but good-hu:
mouredly dodges from one to another, so that no one feels as if he had
been subjected to an “examination.” The following may be given as
a summary of the answers elicited:—

RUSSIAN REASONS.
(Being the English change for Count NEssELRODE's Circular Note.)
As PRINCE MENscHIKOFF's mission has caused a great rumpus,
And a notion prevails that the Czar's in the wrong,
And as England and France may be able to stump us,
These our reasons you’ll state, Courts and Cabinets among.
You need scarcely point out that of truth there’s no particle
In the monstrous report, that our threatenings of war
Are meant to enforce on the Sultan an article
Which puts twelve million Turks 'neath the thumb of the Czar
As no Cabinet gravely can hold such a notion,
You will go on at once to impress, at your Court,
The Czar's Christian care and unselfish devotion
For the Russo-Greek Church in the realms of the Porte.
You will say that his feelings are strictly parental
Towards that Church, of which he is the father and head;
That the influence he wields is all moral and mental—
A fact proved by all he has done—at least, said.
Describe the Czar's, wish to know wherefore this heat is
At demands which existing conventions allow;
Cite Kainardji's and Adrianople's two treaties,
Aud point out that they give all we’re asking for now.
Show how, from beginni i. end of the business,
All about Holy #. the question has been ; -
That, if 'twixt us and France there was some slight uneasiness,
The horizon on that side is now quite serene.
That the Russo-Greek rights have been .# admitted,
And secured by a firman, and Hatti-Scheriff;
So that France and the Latin Communions outwitted,
Yield the pas to the Russo-Greek Church and its chief.
Recapitulate then, as these rights—in the first place–
Are what Russia has always enjoyed, tº: doubt;
And as—secondly—France is now put in the worst place
In the matter, whereon she and Russia fell out;
Andas—in the third place—the Sultan has granted
All we asked by a Firman, which clearly maintains
The rights of our Church, which was all we e'er wanted;
And as-in the fourth place—my note thus explains
The º. and tergiversation
Which the Porte through the whole of this business has shown,
And proves, too, the Czar's great, forbearance and patience,
Guided, as he has been, by his duty alone;—
We cannot conceive what he’s taken to task for,
If on the offensive he ventures to act,
Seeing that we have always had all we now ask for,
And have since got a firman confirming the fact.)
Submit the above, as a full demonstration,
That no option we’ve had, 'tween disgrace and a war,
And ask if #. Porte had so used them, what nation
But must have done just what’s been done by the Czar P
The Soldier's First Step.

Chobham, has proved during the late wet weather to consist in the

DOMESTIC RESULTS OF THE CAMP.
THE Camp at Chobham has already so far answered its purpose as to
have given a powerful impetus to the military propensities of the rising
generation, and there has been a considerable muster of troops in many
a º, which may, on this occasion, be termed a nursery for young
soldiers.
We lately had the privilege of being present at a Grand Nursery
Review and Sham Fight, where the Wooden Cavalry, under the
command of MASTER JONEs, stood a fierce attack from a division of tin
soldiery under the able direction of MASTER and Miss ToDDLEKINs.
The ground occupied was a sort of table land, having for its surface a
tapis vert, or green cover. MASTER Jones was on the º: early, and
the Wooden Cavalry were at once disturbed from their bivouac.; and
the sentries having been summoned from their boxes, took up a strong
position behind some lines formed of an open dictionary, which admitted
of the soldiers being disposed in double columns. The Wooden
Cavalry looked remarkably well, though some of them were evidently
veterans who had been in the wars, for there were many without arms,
a few without heads, and here and there a horse had been curtailed of
a tail, or some other usual adjunct. MASTER and Miss ToDDLEKINs
now brought up-from down-stairs—a considerable body of tin soldiery
of every arm—though, occasionally, deficient of a leg—and these having
been drawn up exactly opposite to the Wooden Cavalry, both sides
were prepared to give or take battle.
The proceedings commenced by the sound of a trumpet feebly blown
by Miss ToDDLEKINs, and responded to on the drum by MASTER
JoNES, when a smart fire of peas, ably directed by MASTER TopDLEKINs,
was opened on the wooden cavalry. The double columns of “Johnson's
Dictionary” for a time sheltered the forces under MAstER Jones; but
a sudden sortie made by Miss ToDDLEKINs shook the %. force
with such violence that several fell en masse, and the melee becoming
general, great numbers on both sides were savagely put to the pea-
shooter. The forces underMASTER Jones being now entirely put to the
rout, their young commander grew desperate and threw down upon the
foe all his stren h, combined in one enormous volume—of the dictionary
already alluded to. -
The loss on both sides was considerable, and among the casualties
must be enumerated an accident of a rather harassing, nature to
MR. Jones SENIOR who, while surveying the field of battle, received
in a small indentation on the right of his nose one of the largest peas
of the enemy. It is satisfactory, however, to add that the battle was
decisive, for no animosity remained on the minds of the * chiefs
on either, side, who, having removed the killed, and wounded,
immediately spread the tapis vert with a repast of the choicest jams,
which they all freely partook of. The only soreness that remained was
on the part of MR. JóNEs SENIOR, but his anger was soon appeased,
and the peas were speedily forgotten.
A FLOURISHING BUSINESS.
HERE is a bit of fine writing:—
“We have been led to imagine that the dark cloud which impended over commerce
in the time of the Star Chamber, had been scattered by the onward progress of civil
freedom—we have from early childhood been thankful that we were not born in the
days when serfdom crippled the body and bigotry the mind of man, and we cannot
think your Lordship will pledge the legislation of the 19th century to an enactment
so offensive as this sponsible police power is to"—
To whom? Well—taking “commerce” as a misprint for “con-
science” one might imagine that the remonstrants were “K John
TUAM,” DANIEL, or DENNIs, or DERMoT, or whatever-his-name-is
QAHILL, FREDERick Lucas, and other such gentry—and clergy—
denouncing a sanguinary, atrocious, diabolical, fiendish, &c. &c. pro-
position for the deliverance of nuns from false imprisonment. But
no. The individuals, to whom the “irresponsible police power” is
“offensive,” are simply
“One branch of English tradesmen.”
That, is to say, they are the Metropolitan Omnibus Proprietors,
complaining by the pen of MR. H. GRAY, their Chairman, to Lond
ABERDEEN, against certain clauses of the Hackney Carriage Act. We
dare say this, “one branch of English tradesmen” will no more be
rendered subject to an “irresponsible police power” than any other
branch of the same tree; but if, “like master like man” is a true
proverb,” the proprietors of omnibuses are gentlemen whom it is quite
right the police should “look after,” and, at least, have power to make
them “move on.” We are glad to see that they admire the onward
rogress of civil freedom, and hope they will contrive to make their
#. and conductors stick to that; for the liberty which those persons
are in the habit of taking is too often destitute of civility.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
INFINITESIMAL LOGIC.
a Eagree with PROFEssoR FARA-
DAY that there issomething yery
startling in the condition of the
public mind in re
scientific reasoning. Here is a
specimen—if correctly reported
—of the ratiocination of a
British Legislator, and agentle-
man of more than average
education, moreover, a polemic
of considerable celebrity, re-
lative to a simple question of
evidence. At a recent meeting
ºf the English Hºmºeopathic
Association,” according to the
Morning Post:-
"Ma-Mali, M.P., moved the adop-
tion of the report, and stated that he
had become a convert to the truth of
the principles of Homoeopathy from
seeing their effects as regarded a re-
lative-though, thanks to the goodness
of Providence, he had no personal
experience of them.”
To any one pºssessed of com:
moll º: and decent
information, who is accustomed
to exercise the least caution in
drawing inferences, who has
the slightest glimmering of an idea of the nature of inductive prºof,
who does not, in short, jump to his conclusiºns like a º it is
truly º that any sane human mind should be capable of such
a generalization as the above, MR. Mºl, sºys that he became “a
convert to the principles of Homoeopathy”-whence? From carefully
siſting an accumulation of evidence, º comparing and sing
º of facts? No; but “from seeing their effects as ed a
relative. -
This is just the mental process by which an old woman arrives at a
faith in Holloway's or MoRIsox's Pills. -
Qbserve, too, that the thing which Mr. MIALI is persuaded of with
such facility, is one which is, so far from being in itself likely,
anteriorly, improbable in the very highest degree, and, indee
ridiculously absurd on the first face of it. - - - --- -
It is curious how nonsensically men, otherwise intelligent, will
argue whenever they meddle with a question relative to medicine;
man is reckoned a fool for talking about any other subject which he
does not understand; but it seems to be assumed that there is
a specialty in medical matters, which admits of sound 9pinions
º: formed respecting them by people who are entirely ignorant
of them.
MR. MIALL, however, uses a correct expression when he calls
himself a “convert” to Homoeopathy. Science has no "converts.”
Scientific truths are either self-evident or demonstrable. Philosophical
systems are not “denominations” or “persuasions.” It is systems of
another kind that exercise faith—such faith as MR. MIALL appears to
repose in Homoeopathy. -
To medical nonconformity, however, let MR. MIALL be welcome, if
he will only suffer nonconformity of another kind to constitute him no
obstacle to that “secular” education which is so needful a preservative
against all manner of humbug. -- -
We say Amen to MR. *ws thanksgiving for never having
experienced the effects of Homºeopathy in his own person; that is tº
say, never having experienced the effects of a serious illness unchecked
by the quackery resorted to for its cure.
- -
A HELP TO JEWISH EMANCIPATION.
The Jews are excluded from Parliament by bigotry—but not merely
by the bigotry of the House of Peers. - -
Facts are stubborn things; they are also bigoted things: at least
Matter-of-fact exhibits a remarkable bigotry in re to the Jews.
Last week, in the law º º the old story of the plucked
º ; º: horse-dealing, bill-discounting, cheating, and ras-
tality. 'Bigoted Matter of fact, as usual, exhibited the scoundrei of the
tale as a gentleman of the Hebrew persuasion.
How is it, that if there is any villany, if there is any wickedness of a
articularly dirty sort; a case of bill-stealing, receipt of stolen goods,
raudulent gambling, marine store-shop, or other disreputable estab:
lishment, the party chiefly implicated is sure, in the t majority of
instances, to he agentleman rejoicing in the name, slightly corrupted
of one of the prophets or patriarchs? For so it is, according to bigoted
Matter-of-fact.
While so much bigotry exists, a corresponding amount of prejudice
must also exist, tending to obstruct the entrance of Israelites into
the House of Commons. For if the bigot Matter-of-fact’s assertion,
that in nine cases out of ten a bill discounter, low-hell-keeper, fence,
or other trader in wickedness, is a Jew, be believed, then the sup-
position that it is ten to one that a Jewis a rogue, is not very
unreasonable. -
Now the Jewish community is not numerous and poor, but just, the
reverse; and its chiefs are wallowing in riches. Would they not take
the most effectual means of getting their disabilities removed, if by
diffusing education throughout their body, they could, manage to abaté
that bigotry of Matter-of-fact which ascribes to it so large a portion of
discreditable members?

MR. Donovan would explain to us the meaning of this phrase, for
though we sometimes hear of an enlargement of the heart, or of a

understand how there can be an enlargement of an individual's
benevolence.

THE JOKE OF THE SESSION.
ONE great cause of the heaviness of Parliamentary debates is the
jokes with which they are interspersed, although these are not
numerous. A speech may contain but a single joke; but that one
joke, or attempt at joking, is such as to give a weight to the whole
discourse which it would not derive from the arguments advanced in
it. To quote a House of Commons', witticism is generally
Joe MILLER, whom Honourable Gentlemen seem to cram in order to
amuse, as they cram ADAM SMITH, with a view to instruct one another.
Their jokes, like a very different kind of things, Chancery decisions,
are warranted by precedent. Liberals though some of them may be
in earnest, they are all Tories, in fun. Stare super antiquos jocos is the
inotto of the extremest Radicals among them. The boldest innova-
tors of the Manchester School show a veneration for antiquity as far
as that goes. When the cellars of the House of Commons are searched
for GUY FAWKES, it is wonderful that no explosive matter is found in
them; no jokes in bottles, laid down many years ago, full of beeswing
so to speak; old and dry. The foregoing reflections were su ted
by a report, in the Parliamentary intelligence, of the most brilliant
joke that has for a long time, as a gent eman in the Brigade might
say, shaken the walls of St. Stephen's. This highly successful sally
was made in Committee on the Expenses of Elections' Bill by
“Ma. ELLIoTT, the Member for Roxburghshire, who expressed anxiety to know, as
the clauses prohibited persons ºf: whether in future any of his constituents
would be fined for playing the Scotch fiddle?”
If this, pun, is not very witty, at least it savours of the quality
nearest allied to wit. MR. ELLIOTT's humorous question, moreover
is no unmeaning.joke. It expresses a feeling probably very general
among his constituents, who, we trust, will not, by any ungenerous
legislation, be de rived of that relief, under circumstance of suffer-
ling, which they have always enjoyed under the ancient Scottish
constitution.
PAPA TO HIS HEIR.
A FAST MINOR.
My som, a father's warning heed;
I think my end is nigh:
And then, you dog, you will succeed
Unto my property.
But, seeing you are not, just yet,
Arrived at man's estate,
Before you full possession get,
You’ll have a while to wait.
. A large allowance I allot
- You during that delay;
And I don't i. you not
To throw it all away.
To such advice you'd ne'er attend;
You won't let prudence rule
Your courses; but, I know, will spend
Your money like a fool.
I do not ask you to eschew
The paths of vice and sin;
You’ll do as all young boobies, who
Are left, as you say, tin.
You’ll sot, you’ll bet; and being green,
. . At all that’s right you'll joke;
Your life will be a constant scene
Of billiards and of smoke.
With bad companions you’ll consort,
With creatures vile and base,
Who'll rob you; yours will be, in short,
The puppy’s common case.
But oh, my son! although you must
Through this ordeal pass,
You will not be, I hope—I trust—
A wholly senseless ass.
Of course, at prudence you will sneer,
On that theme I won’t harp;
Be good, I won't say—that's severe;
But be a little sharp.
All rascally associates shun
To bid you were too much,
But oh! beware, my spooney son
Heware one kind of ºuch.

LAW ON ITS LAST LEGS.
Of all the indignities to which the legal profession has been exposed,
we know of nothing to º the insult just passed upon it by the
º authorities of St. James's, Westminster, who have advertised
or a first-rate lawyer to fill, the place of Parochial Messenger; Qur
assertion might appear incredible, were it not sustained by the following
extract from one of the Times' Supplements:—
AROCHIAL MESSENGER.—St. James's, Westminster.—WANTED, by
the Governors and Directors of the Poor, a respectable PERSON, of active habits,
to fill the above situation. He must be thoroughly acquainted with the Law of
Settlement, the practice at sessions relating to appeals, and with º business
generally concerning the poor. The duties and salary annexed to the appointment
may be ascertained at my office, No. 50, Poland Street, Oxford Street, daily, between
9 and 6 o'clock; where also applications, accompanied by testimonials of character and
ability, are to be left on or before Thursday, the 14th instant. By order,
GEORGE BuzzARD, Clerk.
Now every lawyer is perfectly aware that the law of settlement is a
subject so abstruse and difficult that a “thorough acquaintance” with
it can only be derived from years of study and practice at the Bar;
and it is, therefore, quite evident that the Guardians of the Poor of
St. James's, Westminster, expect one of the ablest Sessions barristers
that can be found to undertake the place of messenger. e will
admit that business has sadly fallen off, but we are not yet prepared to
believe that our BoDKINs and our BALLANTINEs, or even our
HoRRIDs and our FLORIDs, will yet be content to undertake the
task of running on , parochial errands, and , delivering parochial
messages. We shall, however, not be surprised at finding a forensic
sergeant advertised for as a sergeant of police, because it is neces-
sary the latter should know the law; but we hope it will be lon
tº: our WILKINSEs cease to ornament Qur Bar by their splendi
#. and begin to exchange the coif for the cape, or the big wig for
the baton.

A. DAUGHTER OF THE CAMP.
Miss CARoline to her brother, student at Haileybury College.
“MY DEAR HENRY,
“Mamma and Papa desire me to say that they were very
much gratified at reading that you acquitted yourself so well at the
examination, and Papa has given me a cheque to enclose which, I dare
say, you horrid creature, will make your sister's letter less of a “baw’
than usual; ...I sincerely hope that you will profit by the address of that
dear old white-headed SIR JAMEs, and learn to be “considerate of the
.# and wishes of those around you; ” that is, that you will not
grumble in the holidays at having to take JULIA and me to the Opera,
or insist on smoking in your bedroom when you know that the smoke
comes under MARIA’s door. However, I won't scold you as you have
been such a d boy at school-bless me, College, I mean; ten
minons of pardons, I’m sure. -
“On Monday we all, went to the Camp at Chobham, choosing the
day quite accidentally, but so fortunately. The next morning, while
was cutting the Times for Papa, I was greatly delighted to read this:-
“The ladies, especially showed a surprising knowledge and appreciation of the
manoeuvres performed. Should our brave defenders ever be called upon to protect
our homes and altars, regiments such as those now at Chobham will not, despite the
Peace Society, want Daughters—though in these piping times they have none.”
As to the last part, if one could hope to cqual that dear divine JENNY
LIND in La Figlia, one would almost not mind wearing the odious
costume, thoug of all the ungraceful—but what do #. boys know
about such things? I want to assure you that the first of the
story is quite true, and shows that the clever gentleman who wrote it
sets more value on the opinion of young ladies than some young gentle-
men do whom I could name, but will not. Now, as an account of what
we saw must be useful to you in your studies (though you are only in
the Civil Service), I will tell you a little about it, and Papa says you
are to send him a comparison between the battle of Cannae (is that
spelt right?) and the battle of Curley.
“We got a capital, place for seeing, and we had not been on the
ground many minutes before some one blew a horn, and out ran numbers
of those large green beetles of Riflemen, and began to pretend to
skirmish; but, as there was nobody to face them, they looked great
silies. But º there was a heavy tramping, and on came the
Guards, looking perfectly splendid, and ran u ºil. But I should
tell you that on the top of this hill were some Sappers and Miners (it
seemed an oddd: to put them), and some soldiers with short guns,
and when the Guards had gone a little way up the hill, the others let
of their guns at them. Then the Guards pretended they could not
advance any higher, so the great cannons were set roaring off, and I
thought I should never get the throbbing out of my ears. Weil, I
suppose this encouraged the Guards, for they made another rush; and,
at the same time, the Household Troops and the Light Dragoons went
galloping and tearing in the same direction, and looking as if they
...}i. over everything in the world. However, they didn't, for it
seems that it was necessary to fire more cannons, only this time it was
the Horse Artillery. After this there was great confusion, and I do
not believe that anybody knew what he was to do; however, they all
got upon the hill, and their swords and helmets sparkled º In
the sunshine. Lastly, those Highlanders, with the legs, made a lo
line, and then gave way for the others to come through it, like the
opening figure in the First Set, and the green beetles began poppin
again, and the cannons were let off once more...Then they all went o
the ground, and we had a dreadful to-do with a gipsy baby, which
JULIA had foolishly taken to hold; and the mother went away, leaving
the brown little creature with us, and could not be found until long
after we were ready to go. JAMEs said that if we left it on the grass
it would be all safe; but this we would not hear of. The poor child
would have been the better for the tub you used to hate so a few
I |years ago when Mr. HENRY was only Master;
“Now, you are to say whether this was like the battle of Canna–I
don’t mean as to the baby, of course. And, if you will take my opinion,
the evolutions were all nonsense. I do not see the use of cannon at all,
and I am quite certain that, if the Guards rushed at an enemy as they
ran up that, hill at first, the enemy would run, away, at once;
Also I think the cavalry and the infantry ought to be mixed
}. together, because then the soldiers on horseback could protect
the others, and change with them when the poor men on, foot
were tired. Besides those dear horses never kick; so, it would be
quite safe; a soldier told me that, as I was giving his lovely black horse
a sponge cake which he eat out of my hand. I think that if you gave
this idea to the masters at your school-College, I mean—you would be
thought very clever. But decidedly I do not like the cannons, and I am
certain they are of no use. -

THE NEW CAB ACT.

|J
Though on the .." of “Hear both sides,” we have no objection
to allow even the hoarse voice of a cab-driver to address itself to the
polite ears of the public on the great question of Cab Reform, we
must protest against many, if not all, of the positions, taken up and
set down, by the editor of the New ilº arriage Act, in the fol-
lowing edition of that useful measure. We have not taken the trouble
to answer the arguments of the unlearned annotator, inasmuch as we
feel it to be quite unnecessary; for every one will see at a glance what
the cabman is driving at.
THE NEW HACKNEY CARRIAGE BILL,
Edited by A CABMAN.
This here measure sets out at a sort of full gallop, which is nothing
more nor less than furious driving against us |. cabmen, by sayin
that it is “Enacted by the QUEEN’s most Excellent §...ºf
I don't deny that she is—and “with the advice and consent of the
Lords Spiritual”—[them's the bishops: which I, should like to know
who ever seed a bishop in a cab, or on a 'bus, and therefore what have
they to do with it?). The Act has twenty-two clauses; and every
clause is intended to stick it into us. I shall take them clauses one by
one, and if I use a little more license than the Commissioners like, they
must recollect they makes us pay precious dear for our license, so we
may as well have our say for our money. -
I. Everybody who wants a license must apply in Wilf ;
poor unfortnate feller can't comply with the letter of the law by v
a letter which he never learnt to do, he must take to thieving, or
something else, for he mustn't keep no cab, nor nothing.
The Commissioners is to have power to inspect your wehicles and
your cattle whenever they like, so that when your 'bus is full and your
passengers in a hurry to go by the train, you may all be pulled up
while SIRRICHARD turns over the cushions, and sees if you've got any
broken windows in 3. "bus, or any broken winder drawin' of it. Of
course nothin' will be good enough, unless, we have velvet hottermans
to keep the insides warm, and downy cushions for the outsides, as if
we wasn't downy enough already. As to the horses, I don't know
where we are to get ’em good enough. Praps they’ll expect us to
buy all the Derby winners and them sort of cattle to do our opposition
work with. But I suppose there’ll be a grant of money next year from
the public purse, for private speckelatiºn won't make it pay anyhow.
3. Purwides that, if we don't keep hansom private carriages for the
public, and first-rate cattle to draw four on 'em about at three-half-
pence a mile a-piece, we are to be fined three pounds a day, and go to
prison a month for every day; so that, if we’ve done it for a whole
ear, we may be fined upards of a thousand pound, and be locked up
or about five-and-thirty years. Consekwently three years would give
us a hundred and five years imprisonment.
4. This takes all the crummy part of the bread out of our mouths by

which meant a shilling. Never mind! We’ll get it out of 'em some-

a book of fares. What right have we to turn our cabs into a library or
bookcase? When we make a mistake about a fare they always j us
we “ought to know the law.” Why ought we to know it better than
them as hires us? Let them carry books themselves. We’ve got

as many as our license says—though, sometimes, one fat rider woul

carry a dozen.
10. This is the unkindest cut, of all, for it says we shall carry a
“reasonable quantity of luggage.” Why, with the women, there’s no
end to what they call a “reasonable quantity of luggage.” I wish the
Parlyment would have just settled §. for us; for, if four females is
going off to a train to spend a month at the sea-side, who is to say
what will be a “reasonable quantity" of bonnet-boxes, carpet-bags,

CHAGRIN FOR OLD COMMODORES
RECENT leading ar-
ticle in the Times
quotes, a , return,
which has been ob-
tained by MR.HUME,
of certain statistics
relative to flogging
in the Navy; whence
it appears that the
amount of human
torture inflicted on
British sailors, re-
presented in the ag-
gregate by 40,545
lashes during the
year 1848, had de-
clined in 1852 to
17,571. In com-
menting on this de-
crease in the torment of seamen, the Times remarks, that this “odious species of
punishment is falling more and more into disuse; ” and, moreover, that
«º
wº-
ºs---
3.2%
“Anything like a frequent resort to it is taken to reflect discredit, not only upon the whole ship's
company, but upon the officers in command.”
If a return could be §§ of the number of imprecations uttered on reading
the above passage, by bluff old retired admirals and superannuated sea-captains,
in clubs and coffee-rooms at our various sea-ports, where they are accustomed to
growl over the degeneracy of the service, we should probably be presented with
a startling array of figures. By the stigma which is cast upon the discipline
which these veterans, for the most part, boast of having maintained, their i.
* º as cruelly lacerated as they themselves cver caused the backs of their
men to be.
POISONOUS PUFFS.
SoMETHING has been done, of late, towards the abatement of nuisances.
Cinder-heaps have been swept away, sewers º: cesspools closed, and
ystalls removed from under our noses. There still remains, however, a great
deal of noxious and offensive stuff to be got rid of; particularly since, instead of
merely contaminating our air, and water, it infects the fountains, of our current
information. It taints the library, it defiles the drawing-room table. This grave-
olent evil is the pest of soiled newspapers—journals of ill savour—not imparted
by any fetid sort of printers' ink, but by vile advertisements, whereat the
ºl nostrils, indeed, are not offended: but the moral nose is in great indig-
nation.
An obscure and narrow street through which few respectable persons, and
no ladies, ever pass, bears a scandalous name, and is considered a disgrace to the
metropolis, by reason of the sort of literature displayed in its windows, which is
precisely of the same quality as the advertisements alluded to ; and these, in the
columns of reputable and even “serious” journals, get introduced into families,
and lie about the house, to attract the notice, and obtain the perusal, of the
younger members of the establishment, male and female.
You may take up—or what is of more consequence—your little boy or girl may
take up—a newspaper, and read, on one side of it, a leading article which might
be preached out of a pulpit: on the other a series of turpitudes unfit for utterance
under any circumstances.
These atrocities are heightened to the point of perfection by the circumstance
that they are the puffs of a set of rascally quacks, not the least mischievous of
whose suggestions are the recommendations of their own medicines—poison for
the body which they vend to simpletons, whilst they disseminate mental poison
gratis, both in the advertisements themselves, and in books which form the
subject, of them, in addition to the other poison.
As the ..º.º. whose journals are sullied by these putrescences
may be of opinion that the odour of gain, from whatever source derived, is agree-
able, and, therefore, preserve them as rather fragrant than otherwise, the following
exhortation has been addressed to their customers:—
“It rests with you-with you alone, newspaper readers, to stop the torrent. And you can do it,
without expense, and with but little self-denial. Let each individual that receives this appeal
write without delay to the editor of the paper he reads, whenever he sees it defiled by one of these
easily-recognised advertisements, and say that, unless its insertion is discontinued, he cannot, in
conscience, any longer patronise, the publication. Whatever your station may be, you can do
something; and the higher it is, the greater is your influence and responsibility. On country
gentlemen rests mainly the persistence of the evil in provincial papers; they can, and we trust
they will stop it. Let, too, each one of you that are advertisers, be you publishers, men of business,
authors, masters seeking servants, or servants seeking masters, refuse to appear any more in such
company, and let it be known at the newspaper office why you withhold your patronage.”
The above ph is extracted from the prospectus of a society which has
been formed for the special purpose of suppressing this villanous puffery. The
association is entitled “The Union for Discouragement of Vicious ºri.
ments;” and we hope, it will succeed in closing a channel of communication
which has all the qualities, except the utility, of a gutter.
THE ECCLESIASTICAI, AUCTION MART.
“DEAR PUNCH, -
“GoING the other day into an auction-room in a
large commercial town, with the view of purchasing a
small fancy business, I found that havin already disposed
of it, and of a cheesemonger's good- and stock, the
auctioneer was endeavouring to sell a church, on whose
merits he was expatiating much in the following terms:-
“Come, Gentlemen, pray give attention
To the Lot I’m now going to sell;
For it don't want a poet's invention
Its manifold merits to tell.
If a gift, or of praying or preaching,
In any one present has shone,
He may further exemplify each in
The church, now put up, of St. John.
“It is not some old weather-worn building,
Clad with ivy, and mouldering and grey,
But as fresh as paint, varnish, and gilding
Could make it, 'twas made 't other day;
And if any, who hear me, are pinning
Their faith some one order upon, .
I can tell them they’ll find a beginning
Of all orders and styles, at St. John.
“It is held of the Town Corporation
For a term, at a º. rent,
And will surely reward speculation
To the tune of some fifty per cent.
The fixtures are mats, stools, and hassocks,
And (as second-hand garments to don
Is the fashion with curates) the cassocks
Of the late worthy priest of St. John.
“If the sittings (not counting the free seats
Which are placed in the draught near the door),
Be computed, I think there must be seats
For nine hundred pew-renters or more;
Then the district quite swarms with young ladies,
And the tenant who's recently gone, -
From the slippers they worked him, quite paid his
Clerk, sexton, and choir of St. John.
By the bishop its licence was granted;
But the owners no bid will reject—
As the cash is immediately wanted—
From any persuasion or sect.
There, the Jumper may practise gymnastics;
There the Ranter’s iſ. tongue may run on;
Turks or Hindoos, or Buddhists, or Aztecs,
May use, if they pay for, St. john.
“Ha! a Thousand! a Rapper then offers;
Fifteen hundred' the Mormons exclaim.
Come, Gentlemen, open your coffers,
For your biddings are terribly tame.
Two thousand | Not half enough . . Yet it
Must go to the Rappers; Going ! Gone !
The key’s with the sexton, Sir; get it,
And yours is the church of St. John.”
OUR METEOROLOGICAL REPORT.
THE public is much indebted to a gentleman named
Low E, who lives at Bermondsey, and writes every day
to the Times, to inform the world which way the wº
blew on the pr day, how much rain fell late in
the evening, what amount of cloud was floating about
at a particular hour of the day, and other equally interesting
particulars. On Tuesday this º reports his detec-
tion of some “cirri,” and he kindly writes to the Times :
to give the world the benefit of the discovery.
Anxious to make ourselves generally useful, we have
attempted a few meteorological observations on our own
account, and the following is the report we have to offer:-
Barometer fell—to the ground and smashed.
Thermometer rose to blood heat—having been turned
upside down by an infant.
Direction of wind—right in our own face.
Amount of rain—00l. in. in our umbrella stand.
Amount of cloud—9 from our own tobacco-pipe. Should
our scientific observations as recorded above tend to throw
any light upon anything, we are more than satisfied.

NOTICE TO CORRESPONDENTS.
OH DEAR No! OLD BR-GGs Is Not DEAD–HE HAs
A BIG BROTHER OF MERCY.
| Besines the Plymouth Brethren, there are the Plymouth Sisters,
called Sisters of Mercy. These ladies, however, appear to stand, in
the relationship of Sister to something else, than, Mercy; to Choler,
we may say, and Choler unbridled, so to speak, and rather asinine.
The Morning Post published the other † a correspondence between
a MR. J. D. CHAMBERs and MR. PHINN, M.P., which will probably be
considered to supply the foregoing remark with some foundation.
There is, it appears, among the Sisters of Mercy, a lady who is also
the sister of MR CHAMBERs. On her behalf MR. CHAMBERs writes a
letter to MR. PHINN, to demand whether he, in his place in Parlia-
ment, made certain statements respecting the community to which she
belongs, imputing to them systematic fraud and º; and the
endeavour to convert their institution into a Roman Catholic nunnery.
MR. PHINN replies that he might decline to answer. MR. CHAMBERs
on the ground of privilege, as well as on that of the intemperance an
want of courtesy displayed in MR. CHAMBERs's letter—which rights,
however, he waves; says that he cannnot reconcile º reports
of his words, nor exactly remember those which he used; but denies
that his ºf: as reported by any of the papers, conveys the impu-
tations alluded to by CHAMBERs, or t e made odious and
º accusations of fraud and dishonesty against the ladies in
quesuon.
TAKEN To YACHTING FOR THE BENEFIT of HIs HEALTH.
MR, PHINN then proceeds to remind his peppery correspondent
that the late QUEEN Dowager felt it her duty, after strict investiga-
tion, to withdraw her support from the Society, on the ground that its
doctrines were at variance with those of the Established Church.
To this reply MR. CHAMBERs rejoins, reiterating his statements as to
. i. utation of fraud and duplicity, and ºš. in the following
polite terms:–
“My duty, therefore, as her (his sister's) protector, is simply to tell you, in plain
words, that such your accusations are false.'
Everybody, of course, knows that the Sisters of Mercy form that
celebrated community which rejoices under the superintendance of a
single lady, writing herself “Y” Mother Sup'; ” not being a mother, or
even a mother-in-law, or a mother in any sense known to the law, or
in any sense whatever except a Roman Catholic one. ...
Mā. PHINN merely expresses an opinion about the Sisters of Mercy,
which is entertained by most other people, saying Puseyites at a
temperature of red heat. The charge against him of º: falso
accusations is itself an accusation that is untrue... -
The convent, or whatever it calls itself, of the Sisters of Mercy, is no
doubt a highly respectable, though a pseudo-Roman Catholic concern;
Before Mr. 8. figures again as the “big brother,” he should
not only make sure that the honour of his relative has been impugned,
but it will be well, for him to consider whether he does, her quasi-
nunnery much good by constituting himself a bully to the establishment.

OUR HONEY MOON.
-º-
SATURDAY, MAY 25, 18–
I can Not but confess it—I felt hurt, twitted by the easiness, the un-
concern of FRED., Of course I should have thought it very foolish, may,
worse in him, to be jealous. That would have been ridiculous, un-
worthy of him. Nevertheless, I could not help endeavouring to place
myself in his situation—to enter into the feelings of a husband, and to
think myself a man!
That a letter—and such a letter—should have been sent to me, was,
of course, a mistake. But, for all that—putting myself in the lace of
a man and a husband—for that was, of course, the most reasonable and
the most natural way for a woman to come to a right conclusion—I
could not have been so calm, so tranquil, I may, indeed, say—so stone-
cold. Indeed, judging, moreover, from my own feelings as a woman
and a wife, it would have been impossible: not that I'm of a jealous
habit of mind. No, certainly; I should say, quite the reverse. Still, it
is quite plain, that if we really value ..". a thing—we must be
anxious accordingly... That is but natural. Nevertheless, I cannot
disguise it from myself that Farn-even after he had handed me the
letter to read, and I-all in a twitter I must say—had read it to him,
did nothing but laugh. I’ve no doubt he was very right; and yet,
; I * myself and I’d been in his place—I don't think I should have
aughed.
“Read the letter, Lotty,”—cried FRED–" by all means read it; it
may amuse us.”
“To be sure,” said I; “not that it can be for me.” And then, when I
º: the stupid bit of paper, it seemed to scorch my, face and some-
thing came into my throat, as I began to read the ridiculous words—
º My dear and beautiful girl.’
“Must be a mistake,” cried FRED; though I thought I saw him
Just, bite his lip, and just a little wrinkle his eye-brows. “But go

. “‘I have beheld you in silent admiration; but now I feel longer silence
impossible /* I shan't read any more,” said I, “for how can it con-
cern me—I mean us?”
“Go on,” cried FRED, hooking his, fore-finger round his nose and
rubbing it in his manner, when he is thinking.
f i# ºplain gou were intended for a brighter destiny than what has be-
g wow,
“Come,” said FRED in his aggravating way, “that's no compliment
to me.
“To you! Then, if it comes to that,” said I, “and if for a minute
you think this stuff was written to me, you may read the rest yourself.”
And with this—with all the *. I could-I flung the letter at him.
Yes; at him; and as he looked up, and a little astonished, but more
hurt, as I thought ". his eyes at me—I felt myself so wrong,
so rebuked, that 'I ung my arms about his neck, and the next
snatched up the note to tear it to pieces. .
“Stop, Lotty;” cried FRED; “as it is not our . we’ve no
right to destroy it.” And then he put the letter in his breast pocket;
and, as he did so, I had a twinge of the heart, a cold chill, for all the
world as though he had put a viper there. -
“FRED, dear FRED,” said I, and what ailed me I couldn't tell;
but all Irecollect was that saying or stammering, “let.us go home,” f
fell upon his neck; and after awhile, coming to myself, I found Jose-
PhIN?—now pale and now flustered—at my side. But still the wish
was in my thoughts. “Do, do let us go home.” .. -
“Well, Lotty, love; we will go home. In a little while; a very
little while; a day or two’—
“Now, FRED, to-day.” . . -
“Why, today, Lorry, is impossible. The fact is, 1 expect—but
never mind; ” and I felt sure there was something FRED was hiding
from me; º I ought to know. But before I could re º he
took his hat and left the room. I don’t know what could have
possessed me; but, for the minute, I felt alone-all alone in the
world; and the next, such a newer, deeper love—I had thought it
impossible to be so—for FREDERick; and then—but JoséPHINE was
present, looking so curiously at me, that I was directly called to myself.
“You’d never think of going home, Ma'am, without a peep at
France?” said Joseph INE. - -
“What I think can innoway concern you,” I replied very freezingly;
for, somehow, I could not quite understand Joseph INE’s looks.
“Certainly not, Ma'am ; only to be so near France, and not to cross,
what would people say? And lace I’m told so cheap there ! Not
that I wish to go myself. Certainly not. Oh dear no... Old England
for me. I’m sure I can stay here till you come back with the greatest
pleasure in—no, not exactly that: still, Ma'am, I can stay.”
And the more he taſked, and the more flooked at her, the more she
seemed in a sort of pucker and flurry that—I’m not suspicious: still,
it did #. mysterious. -
“I shall not go to France. We shall return straight home, and you

this, I left the room to join FRED ; and he—I discovered to my great
annoyance—had gone out. Gone out ! . It was very odd.
I couldn't rest indoors. So, without a word to Joseph.INE, I put
on mythings—snatched
he be?
As the time went on, and I continued to look for and expect him
could scarcely contain myself. I sat down upon the
Sun, º: so magnificent. I tried to
myself, g out a home in the clouds. Such a home!
gardens and golden ſº and palaces of ruby pillars—but no; it
.#" do. And I felt all the angrier that I so tried to cheat
myself.
At the moment, who should glide past me-not seeing me, as I
thought—but 'the very, gypsey child who had brought that foolish
bouquet, and that stupid noteſ
fresolved taking a minute's counsel with myself, to discover the
individual who had employed the gypsey; so fo owed the child, who
suddenly seemed to guess my determination.
Ma'am?” said the girl. “Buy a nosegay to get me a bit of bread.'
“Now, if I buy this nosegay’—and the little creature, looked at me
with her glittering eyes, as much as to say—in her artful manner—she
was quite a match for me—“Will you tell me the truth?’”
“Yes, lady; that I will, whether you buy or not, and sixpence will
be cheap at the money.” -
“Well, then, who told you to bring me that nosegay yesterday?”
“Oh,” cried the perplexing creature, with a burst of enjoyment,
jumping up and down—“such a gen!'man! Give me a shilling.”
.# ow did you know me—I mean, did he point me out to
you?”—-
“Yes;” answered the little elſ—for she looked to me like a mis-
chievous sprite, she laughed as I thought so wickedly—“yes: you was
with another.”
“Another?”—
“Yes: but that was in the fore-part of the day; and you, both went
away so quick, that you give me, no chance; and the gen’l’man called
me back. When I seed you in the arternoon, then I give it you.”
“And what sort of a-agentleman?”
, “He’s now a walking—or was a walking just by the-but would you
like to see him **
: No; certainly not.”.
“‘Cause you can. Give me, sixpence, and I’ll shew him you, and
say nothin’—not a word, my lady. "Only round here—'tisn't a minute.
I’ll walk first.” -
Without a thought, I was about to follow the child, when FREDERIck
coming behind me, laid his hand upon my arm, “Lorry, my dear,”
and without looking at him, I thought I should have dropped at his
Wolce.

I saw the Light Cavalry, so heavily accoutred, that it seemed a
perfect farce ever to have ordered them on “active” service.
I saw the Infantry dressed in such torturingly tight coats, that it
appeared a bitter mockery to bid them “stand at ease:” and I thought
I that what made them smart on parade must make them anything but
in actual service. -
I saw the troops generally learning to stand water as well as to stand

I thought that most of the regiments, in attacking a sham enemy,

tion, for its potency is not yet much felt—
there has been a fearful conflict of opinion
between the cab-drivers and the public
as to what is a mile. It is evident that
there must be an appendix added to all
the books on arithmetic, for the purpose
of including Cab Measure, which is quito
distinct from any other measure we have
yet met with, and is about as º:
cally opposed to Long Measure, as chalk
is to any caseal or curdy compºund. In
the eyes of a cabman, “a miss is as good
as a mile;” in fact, anything is as good
as a mile for his—that is to say for his
passenger's—money.

cery. This precious relic was
dug up a few days ago, and
its tattered remains were ex-
posed for a few minutes to
the air in the Court of WICE-
CHANCELLOR. KINTERSLEY.
It arose out of a bill filed
nearly a hundred years ago;
and we need not say that it
must be by this time a pre-
cious old file that keeps the
tattered old thing together.
It was a bill to distribute
all the property of an old
Scotchman among all his
poor relations, and as the
Scotch can always scrape or
scratch a relationship with
each other, and as the rela-
tions of a Scotchman are
certain to be poor enough to want something, the whole of Scotland may be
said to have been more or less interested in the suit in question. Four hundred
and sixty-three persons had already made out a claim, and the descendants of all
these are now contending with the descendants of another batch of poor Scotch:
men with “itching palms,” who have filed bills of reviver for the purpose of
alvanising this spe&tral old suit, which still haunts, like a ghost, the Courts of
hancery.
The Wechancellor made an order for a reviver, “no one ºf to oppose;”
and, mdeed, who could have appeared but a few ghosts of dead legatees to
demur to the galvanising, of this supulchral business? We are satisfied that his
Honour, when making the inquiry if “any one appeared to oppose,” must have
felt, with a shudder, that he was performing a species of incantation, and that to
call upon any one to “appear” under . circumstances was almost equivalent
to an invocation of Zamiel. The “suit,” however, is to be permitted again to
walk the earth for a time by the agency of a bill of “reviver,” and we suppose, it
will disappear at the cock crow of the long vacation, to come forth again in the
dark days of term-time during the ensuing November.
WILD FLOWERS FROM CANADA.
MR. Pungº has had much pleasure in receiving a newspaper from some ºf his
friends in West Canada. It is called the Hamilton *. and Mr. Punch
cannot give a higher idea of the excellence of the journal than by mentioning that
the first article in the number sent him is from own pen. So long as the
colonists keep such models before them they may safely be trusted with any
amount of “self-government.”. - - - -
He must, however, confess himself rather less pleased with a report contained in
thenext page of the Hamilton *f; It is an account of the latest proceedings
in, the House of Assembly. e, House was in “Committee of Supply,” and
salaries, printing expenses, and such matters were in discussion. The report shall
speak for itself.
“The next item was £15,094 for expenses at Spencer Wood. MR. Mackenzie objected to it;
saying, that he supposed Colonel, Panck would like to treat him as he had once treated the poor
prisoners at Sandwich, who were shot accordingly. But if the Honourable Member could do so, it
would not prevent him from doing his duty to his country.
“Colonel. Paſscº looked on Ma. Mackenzie as a reptile, and trod on him as such. For the
Member for Haldimand to talk of these times, when he practised rebellion, murder, and mail º:
It was lucky for him he (Colonel, Pance) did not catch him, for by the Holy Moses, if he had, the
Honourable Member would never have been seen again on the floor of that House. He wished the
Honourable Member had come over then, and by the Holy Moses he would have s ily sent him
to Heaven. He would have given him a soldier's death, and have thus saved the country many
thousand pounds. The Member for Haldimand was an itinerant mendicant, who earned a fortune by
sitting in that House and getting a pound a day, because he could not get a fortune anywhere else.
He concluded by assuring the Honourable Member that, friendly as he was to independence, if he
ever caught him again in the position which he had once been in, he would hang him.
*The resolution was then-carried.”
Now, thisis really rather º for a Committee of **** Irish Members at
home are somewhat turgid and blatant; but, except that GRATTAN (the pre-
sent one, not the clever one, of course) once intimated that he should like to have
the head of one of the Ministers—and really no one wanted a head more than M
GRATTAN-we do not think that this very emphatic style has been introduced into
the English legislature. Imagine Wºº. , on the estimates, intimating
that he should like to hang SIR John PARINgron, for
objecting to one of the items, and enforcing his intimation
by an º to the “Holy Moses.”
On the whole, Mr. Punch is disposed to suggest to
his colonial friends (over whose fortunes he watches with
the utmost interest) that there is one species of “self
government” to which they seem hardly to have given
sufficient attention. It *. Therefore, Mr. Punch,
who is never personal, say no more about it.
GOLD FOUND IN ENGLAND.
THERE seems to be at last a prospect of a check being
put to, the rush to the Diggings by the discovery of gold
in England, and, indeed, it stands to reason that if there is
5. at the Antipodes, we have only to dig deep enough
down in order to get to it from this side of the world,
instead of from the other. jº that there is
abundance of gold in “the bed of the Turon,” we have
nothing to do but to get under the bed here instead of
going, all the way to Sydney for the purpose of getting
intº the bed in question. - -
A paragraph in the Kent Mail announces the discovery
of gold at Canterbury in such a decided form, that we
º may check the insane emigration of those who are
rushing off to Australia to live under canvas, without any
of the comforts or decencies of civilisation, with the idea
that gold, and nothing but gold, constitutes “prºsperity.”
The following is the paragraph towhich we have alluded:—
“Cax remnuny Golorismos-During Friday and Saturday last a
barber in the Friars saw something looking much like sovereigns at
the bottom of the river Stow, but thought they were only buttons, and
not worth his trouble to get. He repeatedly counted them, to the
number of 17. Having, however, communica to others what he had
seen, two young fellows got a boat,* forthwith picked up a number,
which proved to be true and veritable sovereigns. The report getting
afloat, other persons inspected different parts of the river, and in various
places found many more. Altogether above 50l. has been recovered in
this way; and at the bottom of Fortune's Passage, St. Mildred's, a hair
watchguard, with two gold keys and a seal attached, was taken from
the river; and at another spot a portion of a mourning ring was
picked up.” -
We may expect, after the publicity we are now giving to
this affair, that the outskirts of Canterbury will soon be
turned into a “Canvas Town,” and that there will be an
unprecedented demand for fishing-tackle to supply those
who will make a rush, to the goldfishings. It will be
observed that the Canterbury gold discoveries are superior
in many respects to the Australian, for while in the latter
the precious metalisin its rough state, the gold found at
Canterbury is met within the very convenient form of gold
*g. seals, and º: -
me !een puzzling themselves rather
º have -
seriously with the §: how it is that gold has been
found in the river Stow P-but we have no hesitation in
accounting for the fact by stating, that this wealth must
be the result of the washi º of the adjacent see, which
is well known to be one of the richest, if not the very
richest, in the whole world. We mean, of course, the See
of Canterbury.
A LIKELY JOKE.
According to the Liverpool Standard, the Irish have been
quarrelling amongst themselves at Liverpool; but from our
contemporary's version of the affair, we are inclined to
doubt this intrinsically very improbable circumstance. That
narrative states that the row apparently originated as
follows:-
ºAn Orangeman complained that a Papist boy had thrown some dirt
at him.”
Orangemen never º Hºnº of Papist boys,
and Papist boys never throw dirt—either literally, or figu-

THE HAT-MOWING TRICK.
OR some time past we have seen in
the country papers that a great
many parties have been given for
the purpose of trying the hat-moving
experiment. We are not at all dis-
posed to quarrel with the fact, for
we are decidedly of a social turn
ourselves, and we rejoice to find
that º is so favourably pro-
gressing. ut the experiment is so
certain to be introduced at parties,
that we cannot say we see the use
of giving them expressly for the
purpose of its trial. The motion
may in fact be legally regarded as
a “motion of course:” as in-
separable from a party as white kid
gloves and flirting. We would
simply put it to the reader, whether,
in the whole course of his social experience, he ever recollects being
present at a party where, } the time he went away, his hat was not
‘moved” from the peg on which he hung it. For ourselves, indeed, We
may confidently assert that at 99 at least out of a 100 “squeezes” we
have attended this season, our hat has been so severely “ º upon”
in our absence from the cloak-room, that we have scarcely had an inch
of brim left us to walk home in in fact, on more than one occasion
the operators have so far succeeded in their “moving” as to have moved
it altogether of the premises by the time we wanted it: but this has
only happened, we believe, when by some unlucky accident we have so
far forgot ourselves as to have brought a new one.

WHAT IS THE HOUSE OF KEYSP
THE Court Circular tells us that a deputation from “the House of
Keys” had an interview with one of the official somebodies or nobodies
at Downing Street the other day, and MR. Wilson, M.P., told the
House of Commons the other evening that he had a series of resolutions
by “the House of Keys” in his possession. After some research we
find that “the House of Keys” is something or other in the Isle of
Man, answering probably to the vestry of a parish, the beadledom of an
arcade, or some other small local authority.
We should like to be present at a debate among “the Keys,” for we
are curious to know whether they allude to each other as the
“Honourable . Member for Street Door,” “the Honourable, and
Learned Member for Padlock,” or “the Gallant and Distinguished
representative of Tea-caddy.” We do not, quite understand the
principle of election that can lº. in the Isle of Man, if its council
consists of nothing but a bunch of keys; and we are rather puzzled to
guess whether the franchise attaches to persons or things, and whether
it would be the door or the owner of the door, the watch or the owner
of the watch, that would send “a Key” to Parliament. There is one
E. of result in having a House of Keys instead of a House of
ommons; for, of course, in an assembly where the members are all
keys they would be unable to deal with any open question. Perhaps,
however, we may have mistaken the sort of “ Keys” of which the
“House” in the Isle of Man is composed, and the members may be
mere musical “keys”—a set of sharps and flats, playing any tune, just
like any other ordinary house of representatives. We cannot conclude
without remarking that a very long debate in “the House of Keys.”
would remind one of “a lock jaw,” though the association is not
agreeable.

ALARMists needlessly we are not, and would never prematurely
frighten any nervous reader. But we really think it is our duty to

evening, we discovered that the men were all turned in-to strawl

Hath reared his learned head;

With digressions, by tae way,
On juvenile offenders

On their verdict to agree.
They have sworn another jury,
They have called another case,
An hour hath passed, but BIBULus
Hath not yet shown his face,
And the learned Praetor wonders
What the fools can be about,
For he told them what their verdict
Ought to be when they went out.
When, sudden, a plebeian
Excited, rushes in,
And, in a voice that drownetn
E'en FLATULEIUs' dim,
Exclaimeth to the Praetor,
“My Lord, a º here
Says, as how them blessèdjury

“Ho! call the recreamt lictor!”
The angry Praetor cried.
“’Twas his to guard the doºrwa
That nought might be supplied-
Nør meal, nor drink, nor firing,
Exceptin candlelight;
'or so the Law enacteth,
And the Law is always right !”
The lictor comes—“Thou traitor?
The law dost thou deride?

How was the beer º ? “
“My lord, I heard 'em drinking,
And found out that their lay

Who through the open windºw

One moment paused the Praetor,
And with an angry blush,
For the Common Law thus outraged,
His awful face did flush.
One moment you had fancied
#. was about to swear;
º checked the rising impulse,
spoke with awful air:
“Bring forth to me the landlord
Of the public o'er the way;

And summon, too, the potman-
Him who supplied the beer—
And now "ji oreman BIRVLUs
And his bold comrades here!”
With stealth .# still wiping
The froth from of his chim,
They have brºught forth beery Blaulus,

You had not guessed the burden
Upon their thirsty souls,

Then, in Olympic thunders,
The .."tempest broke:
“Ye seem to take it easy;

Think ye, in this its temple

“The Common Law of England
lushes for you, through me;.
Little thought I that these Sessions
Would e'er such scandal see!
Go, shameless men! I'll teach ye

In a room whereto no pewter
Can through the windows walk;
And when you bring your verdict,
About the fine we'll talk.”

BIRULUs knows the Praetor,
Nor idly pardon begs;
But goeth forth crestfallen–
His tail between his legs—
When sudden in the lobby
Is heard a mighty din,
And before the awful Praetor
That potman is dragged in

A loud irreverent laughter
Through all the Court-house ran,
As pot in hand he stood there,
A blank bewildered man! "
And so sternly looks the Praetor,
That the potman knoweth not

And paid for straight and fair.
And what 1 say, your Lordship—
And I means to put it strong—
Is what was I brought 'ere for,
When Iha'n't done muffin wrong?”
“No wrong!” quick spoke the Praetor,
“Ho!, gaoler–let him see,

Go, bear him to the dungeon—
Be the lowest cell his lotſ
Meanwhile to thee, chieflictor
We give in charge the pot.”
They have haled him from the Court-house,
And have locked him up below;
And the lictor guards the pewter,
With its head of froth like snow,
And never while our Praetor
Dealeth stern justice here,
Will the most thirsty jury
Venture to call for beer,
Or the most reckless potman

Bring it from public near!
A HINT.
THE Times newspaper (a publication of merit, and which may º
be known to some of our rs) has just put forth an excellen
article deprecating the terribly long sittings of the House of Commons,
and the love of chattering, on the part of the Members—especially the
new ones—which chiefly conduces to those protracted and unwholesome
séances. . But the Times ought to be perfectly well aware that the
remedy is in its own hands... These objectionable spouters spout, not

All I have turn'd to alike in their turn;
Mesmeric stories are nothing but fables,
Stories indeed, which intelligence spurns.
In all these sensations I own I’m a scorner,
Never in them have my feelings a part;
But, where GoRDON CUMMING was, near Hyde Park Corner,
Öhi there, there is something that touches the heart!
His exhibition of skins show'd the ravages
Hunters can make with the savage wild beast;
But now they have got there a troupe of wild Savages,
Who have not (as yet!) of their guests made a feast.
Kafirs from Borioboola, or somewhere—
There are delighting the civilised world:
Belles from Belgravia in afternoons come there;
Thither the fairest of May-fair are whirl’d,
Dowagers craving for something exciting,
Gentlemen blasé with Fashion's dull round,
Those who find novelty always delighting,
With those dear Kafirs may daily be found.
And º it is there, to see them transacting
Their business of marriage, and murder, and war;
Delightful to sit there, and know that 'tis acting
And not the real thing—which, of course, we abhor.

That ladies of title e'en make the confession
That they in the Savage—nobility trace!
But chief the delight, when the acting is ended,

And there inspect closely their figures so splendid,
And, timidly, even shake hands with each one,
And their dear little baby we smother with kisses,
And stroke and admire its darling bronze skin,
And think that there ne'er was a baby like this is,
As a lion of London its life to begin.
It is all veryſº. to say that a baby
Might be found nearer home, if we sought for a pet,
And i. in the back courts of St. Giles's, it may be,
Hordes of young savages there we could get:
But, they’ve no fancy dresses to set off their figures,
And nothing is thought of an every-day sight;
Anâ" (jºcº"Tomºroused such a penchant for niggers,
That dark skins must now take precedence of white.
That little dark baby could never have vices
Like those which degrade us in civilised life;
And though he may p'raps chop his father in slices,
His country has customs that legalise strife.
But, really—what humbugs call-Civilisation,
Seems spreading everywhere under the skies,
That soon, I suppose, we shall not have a nation
To furnish a savage to gladden our eyes.
A BENEFICE IN THE MARKET.
IN moving, on Wednesday, the second reading of the Simony Law
Amendment Bill — deferred, to the delight no doubt of certain
prelates, to that day three months—Wiscount GoDERICH is reported
to have asked:—
“What was it which the right of presentation conferred? It was a right to select a
man who, as a Minister of the Church of England, was to be intrusted with the
spiritual affairs of a certain place."
Yes, indeed, of a certain place—and, one, would think, when the
right of presentation is simoniacally purchased, of a certain place (not
É be mentioned to ears polite) where the cure of souls would be a
arce.

two file and a half), and to brigade them with the Queen's Piebalds.
It was said, too, that the forces thus brought together would be sepa-
rated as two divisions, and occupy respectively the Scrubs and Starch
Green, and that a sham fight would take place. But the idea (if ever
entertained) was abandoned—for what reason we cannot say, as we do
not happen to know—these things being kept in profound mystery:
but we are informed that a sergeant is under arrest, and will probably
be “smashed” for having said that the ground on Starch Green was
too stiff for the Piebalds. Such an atrocious attempt at a joke will
meet with little sympathy from our readers, and, we doubt not the
offender will meet with his deserts, though, after all, perhaps, the idea
was given up on that ground. The Piebalds, having sole possession of
the bs, went through their evolutions with their accustomed pre-
cision. The “brilliancy” of the movements was somewhat abated in
consequence of GENERAL PUNCH having ordered “field exercise."
instead of “marching order.” But those who have any regard for our
fºllº defenders will, we are sure, willingly give up “glittering
elmets,” &c., for an hing that may conduce to their comfort. We
subjoin a letter which has come into our hands, which will show that
the privates are subjected to privations and moving accidents in peace
as well as war—in barracks as well as in the field:-
To LIEUTENANT WHIFFIN, Royal South-South-East-Middleser
Dun Browns.
“DEAR WHIFPIN, -I must tell you how we have been
Punch, has been wor usup in fine style—four field days a week,
and riding drill on the of days; besides practising pitching tent in
the afternoon in the barrack yard. However, he is such a jolly old
fellow, that we don't mind a little extra work for him. One thing he
has done which we are particularly thankfulfor. He lets us go to his
reviews in field exercise instead of marching order.
“Young GREEN of ours says he considers it a personal favour. You
know he swapped helmets with CAPTAIN WIpeawake when he (WIDE-
Awake) went up to the Duke's funeral, and has never been able to get
his own back since. WIDEAwake is always “so busy he can't give it
him now. The consequence, is, that W.’s helmet rolls about on
GREEN's head like “anything, especially at a trot, and the scales
are so long that he's obliged to keep his mouth open all the field day to
keep it on his head. So that it's fortunate for him that he's only been
a serrefile as yet. If he were to lead a troop he would have some diffi-
culty in giving the word of command. Some recruits only recently
dismissed have a similar difficulty to brave.
“I got my troop last Tuesday, which I suppose you saw in the
Gazette; and as the GENERAL, wants the captains to get up the names
of all the men in the troop, and the number of all the horses, I've got
the troop-roll from Sergeant-Major, and am getting it off by heart... I
had a ‘law-suit the other day. . PRIVATE GRUMBLE reported the
bread, but as he was not supported by the other men, I put him down
easily. The fact is, he's not much liked by the rest of the men in the
troop. He used to be looked, up to as a ‘schollard, but has lost
ground lately, owing to a singular circumstance. A letter appeared in
the Ballynucky Reporter, signed ‘MILEs, and Sergeant-Major tells me
º: on. Old
and was informed in the answers to correspondents, in the next
number, that he was an ass. All the men saw it, and GRUMBLE got
laughed at for his ‘law.” I am very glad the men have lost faith in
him, as CAPTAIN CHUM told me he was always boring about fractions
and the price of shaving brushes. As the GENERALwants us to know
all about straps and buckles, and packingyalise, &c., I told Sergeant-
Major I would look at one yesterday. So PRIVATE MuscLEs was
ordered to show; but as his highlows were at the shoemaker's, and
forage cap at the tailor's, and the rest of the valise was filled with two
sheets and a bolster, I didn't get much information from him. The
Sergeant-Major said I had better order him a week's marching order,
and make him show kit in the afternºon. Which I did, as I, thought
it better to do what the Sergeant-Major said. I looked at the kit in
the afternoon. Such a kit, WHIFFIN, you neversaw. The Sergeant-
Major shook up' everything, and foºminal the fºllow had actually
gºt a wisp of hayrolled up in a helmet-bag to represent a shirt, and his
drors, as he called them, would, Ivºrily believe, reach from my
quarters to the riding school. sº says he's always late for
morning stables in winter because his drawers are so full of holes he
can't get into them, till a candle is lighted. I hope all this “private’
information won't bore you, but I have really had no time lately to
go to town, and see any of our old haunts. Besides, the GENERAL
says we must take an interest in this sort of thing, in order to study the
‘comforts of the men.”
* Good-bye for the present, old fellow. I shall let you know how
we're getting on from time to time.

Accustomed was our fathers to amuse;

That name's purification to complete?
Think'st thou that it required the sulphºrous puff
Of gunpowder, to make it wholly sweet?
Would'st thou eat fire—the fire of other days?
And Shaftesbury to that repast invite?
Knowing thou might'st as well propose to blaze
At any bishop, or at MR. BRIGHT,

Will cause me evermore to think of thee;

THE CABMAN’S BEST FRIEND.
“The Police cases under the New Hackney Carriage Act
show that a determination to struggle against the working of that
measure prevails among the members of my profession, which, though
1 am a legally qualified medical practitioner, is at present that of a
cabman. For, Sir, I turned cabman rather than turn quack or
sycophant, one of which things a man must, in general, turn, who has
to get his living out of people most of whom are weakly in mind
body, and sex: particularly in these days when ladies of rank and
Members of Parliament patronise clairvoyance and homoeopathy. I
may add that I have less driving to do now than I had when I was
in medical practice, and that I get better paid for it.
“My object in addressing you, is to beg that you will use all your
unfluence to make the ji. insist on having the provisions of this
Act, in regard to fares, severely carried out.
“It may be the opinion of insolent WILLIAM, and intoxicated
JAMEs, my brethren of the whip, that in expressing this desire I am
merely uttering the sentiments of a º: magistrate, or other
odious and tyrannical member of the aristocracy, desirous of interfering
between a poor fellow and the swell out of whom it is his business to
get as much as he can. They may be disposed to invoke dreadful
vengeance . me for what they consider a º with wealth
and respectability, rather than a fellow feeling with labour and them-
selves. But, Sir, my beery and abusive friends are both wrong. I
want the Act of Parliament enforced for the benefit of the people;
which is identical with our own.
“The mistake of vituperative WILLIAM, the error of hiccuping and
unsteady JAMEs, is the supposition that cabs were made for none but
extortionate rascals to drive, and none but opulent spendthriſts to ride
in. Nature—for nature presides even over hired vehicles—intended cabs
not only for the conveyance of intemperate dandies with cigars in their
mouths, for travellers in hot haste regardless of expense, and reckless
pleasure-hunters dashing away to Cremorne or the Opera. She meant
them also for the accommodation of sober matrons of narrow circum-
stances and broad umbrellas, poor clerks, small tradesmen, indigent
authors, and other humble persons pressed for time, troubled with
corns, caught in the rain, or otherwise precluded from pedestrianism.
Now, an excessive legal fare was enough to keep these kinds of people
out of cabs; to say nothing of the certainty of an additional demand,
accompanied by insult, and urged in derisive and revolting language.
“Let it be once understood, on all hands, that the new cab tariff is
to be a serious reality, a ...; as settled as the price of a pot of beer,
and I am sure the increase of practice will more than compensate.us
for the diminution of our individual fees; . I speak of those who, like
myself, seek an honest livelihood, by taking as many cases—that is,
fares—as they can, upon reasonable terms, instead of plundering such
patients or victims as they can get hold of to the most villanous
possible extent. - -
“Pray, therefore, impress upon all friends of the working man, that
working men are to be considered in the light of cab takers as well as
in that of cab drivers. There are, some impetuous young blades who
are prone to scatter their cash about on all kinds of cads, amongst
whom we have the honour to rank in their estimation. -
“Accordingly they in general overpay usmonstrously. Advise them
to discontinue that injudicious liberality; it, spoils us: it causes us to
be discontented with full wages, and to laugh in the face of a customer
who proposes to pay us our legal due. It has possessed us with the
notion that º who takes a cab is infinitely rich; so that when
a man does not offer us much, more than we are entitled to, we are
accustomed to ask him ironically whether he calls himself a gentleman.
Hence it is that we dance, with menacing gestures, around those who
resist our endeavours to cheat them; collect mobs about them; and
pursue them with execrations as far as we dare. A stop will be put
to this state of things, by the strict and uniform enforcement of the
much-needed Act which has been passed for the abatement of our
knavery and the prevention of our insolence; I will add, on the whole,
for our good: at least for the good of one member of our. , who

“Well, if Imust say what Ithink, FRED; I don't like MR. TRUEPENNY.

“I don't wish you to like him, my dear. You're to like and love
me; and to love one man industriously and conscientiously is as much
as any woman can be expected to do. More no reasonable husband
can ask of her.”
But this...I wouldn't seem to listen to. “Twelve o'clock,” I
repeated. “Well, what you could find to talk about all that time—
and Isitting here at the window alone”—
“You might have gone to bed,” said FREDERIck.
“Gone to bed! And you out! Why, what can you think me made

“I’m not a stock or a stone.”
“Certainly not, my darling. I may perhaps be permitted to observe

don't like MR., TRUEPENNY, why I can't help it; and there’s an end.

minute—never in all my life did I put my bonnet on so quick—in a
minute I was ready.
The church was extremely full-as we afterwards found—for the
season., FREDERICK was icularly serious; and for MR. THUEPENNY,
if he’d been listening to his own condemned sermon, he couldn't have
been more solemn. It was odd, too, I thought, the glances he now
and then cast towards me. And particularly when the clergyman said
—and he seemed, I really did think for the minute, as though he was
looking right into our pew, when he said—"Thou shalt do no nºr.
at the very words, MR. THURPENNY let his prayer-book slip, and made
such a start to catch, it, that he drew all eyes upon us. I saw
FREDERICK colour scarlet, and bite his lips as he glanced at his friend.
Atlast the service was ove, and we got way. -
“A. very nice sermon,” said TRUEPENNY, trying to say
something. -
“Very soothing,” I added; for I knew he was half-asleep all the
time.
“Yes; that’s it,” said he: “but that’s what I like, when I come
to a watering-place. , Something quiet, something to think over.”
Well, we returned to the inn; and somehow we #: through the
day. I don't know how late Mr. TRUEPENNY would have sat; but,
for all FRED's nods and winks, I was determined to sit him out. At
last-it was nearly twelve–at last he went away. . .
... We shall meet in the morning,” said FRED to him. -
“Of-of course,” said MR. TRUEPENNY; and then with the
twkwardest bow in the world, he left me and FRED together.
“We’d better go to bed,” said FRED, “Isn't it late?”
“Very,” said I; “and for my part I thought MR. TRUEPENNY was
never going.” -
I went into my room, and there upon my table—was a slip of paper
written in Joseph.INE’s hand, with these words:

And now all the horror was plain as light! “Get up!” I thought

He came. I met him with a smile; and didn't I lock the door?

DELIGHT OF THE GROUSE-AT THE PROSPECT OF A LATE SESSION,
PAX WOBISCUM.
. The Irish constituencies being now completely
in the hands of their spiri advisers, it is
contemplated that henceforth the Speaker’s writ
for a new election in Ireland shall be directed to
the priests of the vacant locality. The Reverend
entlemen are to meet (whiskey º and
obacco to be charged to the county), and their
endorsement of their tool’s name on the back
of the writ, without any other form of election,
is to save all the rigt and bloodshed which

HINTS FOR A NEW EDITION OF THE
DRAMATISTS.
WE, have been favoured with a glimpse of the note-book of a great
atic critic, who evidently º giving, or selling to the
world, a great national treat in the form of a new edition of the
dramatists. The annotator seems to combine all the acuteness of the
needle with the straightforward bluntness of the railway buffer. We
subjoin a few specimens:–
NOTE ON THE TRAGEDY OF DOUGLAS.
There is a passage in this play which has escaped the attention of all
ºritics who have preceded me; a passage which shows Glenalcon to
baye been of a social disposition. In one of the scenes with Norval
Glenalvon says (aside),
“His port I love.”
And, from this remarkableº we get three facts: first, that
Glenalcon liked port; secondly, that he had tasted wrºnt's port; and,
thirdly, that the port in question was of a high character.
NOTE ON JULIUS CAESAR.
The character of Casca has never yet had full justice done to it by
the critics; but there is one passage which may be compared to a
perfect thoroughfare for finding our way to Casca's real condition. He
evidently belonged to the landlord or agrarian party in the State, and
there can be no doubt that the terms on which his tenants held of him
were exorbitant. The whole fact bursts in upon us like a thunderbolt
through the roof ºf an out-house, or a broker through the door of an
apartment with the rent in arrear, when we read the following line,
spoken by Antony in the course of his funeral oration over Cesar:
“See what arent the envious Casca made!”
Now, this allusion to the rent made by Casca proves either one of
two things: First, that he let lodgings at a high price; or, secondly,
that he derived a considerable income from a §§ tenantry. I am
inclined to the latter *. for it is possible that had he let
merely lodgings, sºme of the lodgers would have been introduced into
the play, with that mice appreciation of the ludicrous for which
SHAKspeaRE is .*. ..This not having been done, we are
driven on the other hypothesis, to which, on the whole, we give the
preference. -
The above tº will suffice to show the public the addition that
may be shortly expected to a department and style of literature in
which the English ſanguage is already rich—excessively rich-in the
opinion of some of us.

periods, both with reference to its different structures, and with
reference to building purposes. -
It is pleasing to observe how the bitumen was first used, how it was
mº into form, and baked into hardness, by the heat of the Persian
sun. We can trace it through many of its forms until we gome to the
great Roman Brick of nine inches long, three inches broad, and three
inches thick. We now discover, with the satisfaction and pleasure of
the antiquarian, how long these Bricks have endured; but, for many
years, we were not aware of º application of the Brick, other than
that of strength, stability, and support of edifices—edifices which,
sometimes, might really raise the question: To...what extent the
architect for 7 ºne meant to contend with Eternity?” -
We think we are indebted to our Cambridge friends—it may be to
our Harrow friends, we cannot tell—for the first moral or ethical
application of the word Brick.

virtuous tendencies are of the first order, “My dear fellow, yºu are a
Brick.” It becomes, however, more emphatic in the usage of the third
person. “Do you know So-AND-Soº Is he really a man. I
can trust?... Is he a good fellow?”. The answer in one word is,
“He’s a Brick.” The answer is satisfactory, in all senses, to the pro-
; of the question—indeed, a more satisfactory reply cannot be
uttered.
We have heard this kind of expression called slang—it really is not so,

In other States of Greece the principal towns have walls—but where

can afford shall be put on the table; and I’ll shew you the walls.
They met; and AGESILAus had drawn. out his Spartan army before
him, and, with exulting cheer and ed mien, said to his friend
from Epirus, “Look! these are the Walls ºf Sparta, Sir s, and every
rticular man you see is a Brick.” How classical becomes the phrase!

We do not say we have translated the great Plutarch literally, but
we have translated him inspirit, and if that great man had been now
living, and could have seen this, he would no doubt, have been
delighted, and grateful to us for our application of history to the
correction of isms, and to the promotion of sound and sincere
classical literature.

SPIRITED CONDUCT OF MP. CHARLES KEAN.
MR. Charles KEAN continuing to be º to the
nuisance of criticism, has determined, though with much
regret, on a still more decided step in vindication of his
personal dignity than any he has yet taken. Having already
struck off the Free List of the Princess's Theatre all the
critics who have insolently ventured to express unfavour.
able opinions of his acting, MR. KEAN had hoped that
the public would have taken this warning that he is not
amenable to hostile criticism. In this hope he regrets to
find himself disappointed. Many persons still consider
him a bad actor, and have not shrunk from audaciously
expressing this detestable opinion in and out of the
Princess's Theatre. Further forbearance on MR. KEAN's
part would clearly be an act of injustice to himself.
He has, therefore (though at cost of much pain to him-
self), resolved on a measure which he trusts will prevent
any repetition of this annoyance. MR. KEAN deeply
regrets that HER MAJESTY, having '. visited the
Haymarket Theatre, was observed §. doubt, in an un
guarded moment } to laugh at MR. BRAID's offensive (and
most unsuccessful) imitation of MR. KEAN's performance
in the Corsican Brothers, which MR. Buckstone has had
the bad taste to sanction in a ridiculous and entirely un-
successful burlesque or extravaganza, called the Ascent
% Mount Parnassus. This having been brought to MR.
KEAN's ears (as most acts of the same kind are sure to be),
he has, in consequence, struck HER MAJEsty's name off
the Free List of the Princess's Theatre, exclaiming, in the
manner of Richard, and in a tone of dignity which so over-
powered theğ. and stage-manager that he has not
yet recovered the shock—

THE GREAT CHOBHAM
CAMPAIGN.
E learn with plea-

under canvas

neyism would call indiscriminately the veterans and the wetter-uns ºf our encamped
soldiery. If any man lately under canvas has had a stain § rid of, we may be
sure that it has been thoroughly washed out by the showers with which he has been
saturated. The only wonder is that the gallant fellows have not been all washed
away by a mode of “hero wash-up” that would have been indeed deplorable.

to enable him to indulge in every delicacy of every season.
When he thus lives in the House—the Almshouse provided for him—he has the
whole of it to himself, and is required to share it with nºbody except his own
family, if he is blessed with one so far, therefore, from being separated from
his wife in a comfortless ward, he occupies a mansion which is the abode of
domestic happiness. -
His work is mostly as optional, conversely, as his victuals; so that he can eat and
drink as much, and exert himself as little as he likes. The only employment
obligatory upon him is light, clerical duty, and the greater part of that, he is
permitted to delegate to somebody else. He is supposed, hift to be continually
producing new editions of Greek Testament, biblical ºr patristic commentaries,
confutations of Popery, apologies for, Church-rates, and ºther works tending to
the spiritual welfare of the nation; to the due performance of which tasks anecessary

for the maintenance of the order of industrious poverty tº which this useful

Meeting.
GREAT JEW MEETING.
On Saturday evening last, a large and influential meeting of members
of the Hebrew nation assembled in thes ogue, Great Saint Helen's,
for the Fº: of taking into consideration the recent article in Punch,
in which that illustrious individual, remarking upon the fact that Jews
were somehow or other mixed up in most cases of fraud, chicanery and
imposture, strongly counselled the respectable and wealthy portion of
the community to take such measures, as might tend to destroy an
argument especially useful to those whole bigotry resisted the admis-
sion, of the Jew Englishman to the civil rights of a Christian
Englishman.
mong those who were present we noticed BARON INgots, SIR
AARON MonTECHRISTO, MR. ALDERMAN FitzdaviD, the REv. #Audi
HAPHTORAH, PROFEssoRs BERESHITH and BARA, and others, as repre-

not deemed it desirable to ºf the ladies of their families, but in the
body of the meeting we remarked MRs. and Miss IKEY, iſis. Heirº.

..MR. ALDERMAN FITZDAVID was voted into the chair, and a dispo-
sition, to disturbance among the less select part of the meeting was
speedily suppressed by the worthy Alderman reminding them, in a firm
but good-humoured tone, that “he happened to be a magistrate.” A
young gentleman in the crowd appeared to take this remark as personal,
and left the meeting somewhat abruptly, immediately after which it was
noticed that MRs. SHARON was compelled to borrow her daughter's
pocket-handkerchief. -
MR. ALDERMAN Fitzdavid then read the article from Punch, and
said that the Hebrews were ;"| indebted to that periodical. It
had never shrunk from fighting their battles, or from pointing out
their errors, and he was convinced that no right-minded Jew could
mistake Mr. Punch's meaning or mistrust his will...There was no
doubt that the great mass of the Jews in England worshipped gold with
a devotion which made them blind to better things.

Bºnon Ingots said that he was urgent to remove this reproach from
Israel. He looked to education as the remedy, but then the Jews had
already ample provision of well-conducted sc ools. There was some-
thing wantin j. merc book-learning. -
The Rev. RAppi HApiitoriah would not preach to them, but he, in
common with all who endeavoured to do good by instruction, felt pain-
fully that the spirit of modern Jewism counteracted the effect, of the
noble Hebrew rules of life. What was the use of his proclaiming

ThERE is no kind of man more delightful to meet with than a good
clergyman who is also a good fellow, and, moreover, within canonical
and decent limits—a wag. Now, here is one such singularly pleasant
parson, writing, as a correspondent of the Times, thus:–

“Sir, My attention has just been directed to an Advertisement in thc Times of the
| 11th instant, inserted by the Great, Western Railwa
excursion train for Sunday, the 17th instant, to Oxford, Banbury, Leamington,
| Warwick, and concluding by saying, that “the Warwick station is only a short
distance from the romantic ruins of Kenilworth Castle.'
“This last sentence is probably only added as a bait to catch excursionists. It is
well, therefore, that such and the public in general should know that—thanks to its
Company, announcing an
excellent proprietor, the EARL or CLAREspos—‘the romantic ruins of Kenilworth

ºniºn has added much to the morality and proper observance of the Lord's Day in

writes to the Times. He knows well enough—bless him!—that the
liberal EARL of CLARENDON would never have shut up “Kenilworth

any use in opening it to #. He, to be sure, is aware that the un-
gracious deed has been perpetrated by some underling; some sancti-
monious BAREBONEs of a steward, or some methodistical old house-

than fees. Indeed, his use of the Jewish word Sabbath, in this con-

The conclusion of our Reverend humourist's epistle is capital. No
doubt such an arrangement as that of shutting up “a romantic ruin,”
associations of famous memory, suggestive of lofty and solemn thought:
no doubt the arrangement of &losing such an ob ectionable place as this
on the Sunday, must have “added much to the morality and proper

increase the congregation at—the public-house.
THE JOLLY QLD WATERMAN.
AND did you ne'er hear of a jolly old Waterman
Who at the cabstand used for to ply?
He feathered his nest with the passenger's halfpennies,
Smoking his pipe, with a drop in each eye.
He looked so drunk—yet stood so ".
The drivers all flocked to his stand so readily; .
And he eyed the old rogues with so knowing an air,
For this Waterman knew they would cheat every fare.
What sights of gents drunk and incapable, very,
He’d clean out so nice, and politely withal, - - -
As he called the first cab, when the finely-dressed victims
Came staggering out from Cremorne or Vauxhall.
And oftentimes would they be quizzing and queering,
And ’twas all one to ToM, all this chaffing and jeering :
For laughing or chaffing he little did care,
For this Waterman wished but to rifle the fare.
And yet but to see how strangely things happen,
As he jogged along, thinking of º at all,
He was caught by a Cab Act so awfully stringent,
That it caused all the tricks of the cab-stand to fall.
But would this old Waterman feel proper sorrow,
For all his old tricks, and turn honest to-morrow;
And should this old Waterman act with more Care,
He'll be licensed, and never impose on a fare.

PORTRAIT OF AN OFFICER IN THE BLUES.
CURE FOR THE CONSCIENCE MONEY MANIA,
REALLY the Conscience Money Mania is becoming quite a nuisance,
| Every day, almost, the Times contains some such announcement
as this:—
i : “The ChaxcElion of THE Exchequea acknowledges the receipt of half-notes value
£15, for unpaid Income Tax.”
A good healthy conscience is the noblest point in the character of
that noblest work of creation—an honest man. But a diseased con-
science is as bad as a rotten potatoe; it is worse than no conscience at
all; some degrees below mere dishonesty. This kind of conscience
makes people pay omitted Income Tax. They shouldn't do so. . It is
really quite, immoral. The Income. Tax is acknowledged to be an
imposition by GLADSTONE himself, insomuch that he has even made
arrangements for its cessation. . That it never will cease, however;
that it will be as perennial as evil in the abstract, or the fence him.
self, is feared by everybody except the jolly beggars, and those who are
too ignorant and helpless, or too lazy, to earn liability to its infliction.
| Any symptoms of acquiescence in it, of anything but dogged opposition
to it, on the part of the public, will infallibly encourage Chancellors
of the Exchequer to try and perpetuate it. To pay it voluntarily, to
pay it at all except under protest, to pay it id: any circumstances
whatever but those of legal necessity, is to give Chancellors of the
| Exchequer that encouragement: º more to pay it in a conspicuous
and ostentatious manner, at beat of drum, so to speak, as the gentle:
man settles his just accounts in A New Way to Pay Old Debts. And
this is encouraging the CHANGELLOR of THE ExchEQUER to go on
cheating the nation, or rather cheating part of the nation, in order to
bribe the rest. It is being an accessary to the confiscation of one's
| own property; to defrauding one's self: whereas, surely, if suicide is
the worst kind of murder, self-cozenage is the vilest sort of roguery.
Therefore, we argue that the conscientiousness that s conscience
| money on account of Income Tax is, as aforesaid, morbid; a diseased
bump, in phrenological language, which ought to be shayed, and have
ice put to it, or leeches, or cupping glasses after scarification, to be
followed by a blister; recourse to these antiphlogistic measures being
combined with alterative and cooling medicines.

OUR HONEYMOON.
MONDAY, MAY 27, 18–
“ToM's a good fellow,”—said FREDERICK, when he got to bed.
“I don't want to hear anything of ToM now,” said I; for suddenly
I felt as if I could have—well, I don't know what; but I did for the
minute almost hate the man.
“He goes very early, to-morrow. By the first coach, love. I've
promised to see him off.”
“How very kind of you, FRED;” and I could almost have cried, he
seemed as if it was so easy for him to try to deceive me. “Going to
see him off? Then-for it's yery late; for my part, I thought the man
would never go—then ſº better go to sleep, FRED ; that you may be
up, Qtherwise you'll be very tired, dear; very tired.”
“Think so?” said FRED, trying to be cool: for I knew it was only
trying. “Think so?” -
“I’m sure so,” said I, worried and restless and vexed: not that I

it was there. Then I listened again. He was not asleep; I was sure
of that; though he lay as still as any baby, and tried to seem asleep.
Very well, thought I; very well; you º not outwake me: no–I
watch, like any owl. At least like any guardian spirit.
And to think that FRED-my own FREDERick, with one heart
between us, as he's so often said—could lie there; yes, by my very side,
and haye a secret and keep it from me—well, I did begin to think that
dear Mamma was right; and I’ve heard her say she'd never trust dear
Fº further than she could see him—not always that.

have such art. But perhaps he suspected my thoughts; imagined
was watching him! When this entered my head, I determined to
affect sleep myself; and so see which of us could do it the best.

—It couldn't have been above five minutes, but I had dozed off; and
woke with such a start —Almost instinctively I placed my hand under
the Willow; the key was safe. - -
“What's the matter, Lotty 2 Dreaming?”—said FRED; for I
had either awakened him, or he was awake all the time. “ What’s it
about P” he asked. -
“Nothing in particular,” said I, “good night, love; or you’ll be
too late for MR. }...yº - -
At the word, I thought I heard FRED sigh—just gently sigh—and
the sound went like a dagger through me !
And then what a dream I'd had : and it couldn't have lasted above
three—certainly not five—minutes! What a dream!. Such a confusion
of things! ... I thought I still grasped the key, and it turned in my hand
to a pistol. And then I thought I dropt it on the ground, and it went
hopping along like a º popping and going off as it went.
Then I thought I was resolved. FRED should not get up and go out-

cross the threshold of the Flitch. A pretty friend indeed to take a
man out-and that man newly married—to be shot like a sheep; and
to leave a lonely, unprotected, broken-hearted—
The bitter thought was too much for me, I wept in good earnest;
but cried so quietly—I was almost choked—for fear FRED, for he was
not asleep, should hear me! Oh, and again and again f thought if
ever we do get home? What a home riſ make it "And still and I
was sure of it—still he was awake.
And then I thought, suppose he should not go to sleep at all. Sup-
pose he should get up and—well, no matter; I was resolved: I’d get
up with him, I’d go with him, I’d cling to him. I’d never leave
him. I'd call assistance, constables—
And now it was broad daylight, and—yes, surely, he was asleep? I
listened; and I couldn't be mistaken: no, I was sure he slept. And
then I rose gently-very, very gently to look, and—yes, he was in a
deep sleep. His face-that beautiful face—was white, white and
hushed and still as marble! Oh, how much I seemed to learn—

THE WOMAN’S ELEVATION LEAGUE.
HE March of Intellect will
eventually stride, onwards
in “seven-leagued boots,”
for there is every now and
- them some new league claim-
ing to give a forward impetus
| to humanity. The last new
> league is calculated to carry
ºl us many miles in advance of
º everything we have yet ap-
!!! proached, for it is no other
º *. than a "Woman's Elevation
- League.” . Every league of
º this description contains se-
veral acres—commonly called
wise-acres—and, though no
names are given in the “pros-
pectus,” we dare say we
should meet with several
“old familiar faces,” if we
tº could fall in with the com;
\|mittee, and that we should
| recognise among the mem-
Fibers not a few of those pro-
fessed friends of “pro ,”
- who are always making a
hash of something or other, and eventually falling out, among themselves in the
name of “universal harmony.” The “Woman's Elevation League” professes of
course to give Woman a tremendous hoist in one shape or another. e confess
that our own ideas of the Elevation of Woman are not particularly definite, but are
divided between MADAME Poſteyny in a balloon, and MADEMoiselle GELLINI
making her, “terrific, ascent” at Cremorne to the top of a pasteboard tower
amidst a “brilliant display of fireworks.” . Possibly this, is not the sort of
elevation” contemplated by the “league” in question for the female sex, though
it is evidently designed to place Woman occasionally at the º a poll; for it is
contemplated that she shall take her seat in Parliament., We, have been in the
habit of thinking that women are very well as they are, but the “League” is
desirous of making her a doctor, a trader, an artist, a º and a minister.
The League thinks she does not "embrace.” half enough; but we are modesty of
opinion haſ a woman's embraces should be confined to her own family circle as
osely as possible.
It would be impossible for any “League.” #". benevolent its objects
may be, to proceed without subscriptions, and accordingly all ladies who wish to
get “elevated” are requested to send” one shilling” as a preliminary steptowards
h
the happy state alluded to. Any lady may, however,
become qualified for “elevation” for life by a contribution
of five guineas—a sum so large, that we t few women
who take a sober view of matters in general will like to
part with it. We have reasons of our own for thinking
that the “elevation” of Woman would be a dangerous step,
for a woman when once “put up” is not easily put down
agaln.
THE KENSINGTON BUS-MEN.
It would be a great convenience to the public if sºme-
body would undertake the task of issuing a º guide to
apprise us of the fluctuations in the fares of a Kensington
mnibus. The price of shares, and the value of the funds
are steadiness itself to the ups and downs of the fares
demanded by the Kensington conductors, who frequently
vary one hundred percent. from the morning to the after-
noon in their claims on the pockets of passengers. We can
compare the fluctuations of the º fares to nothing
but the daily changes in the price of fish or other perishable
commodities. On the day of the Cab strike the Kensington
and other Bus-men brought out their fares at much higher
quotations; but the pu lic kept aloof, and º few pas-
sengers were “done” at the increased prices. t is some
satisfaction to feel that after October these “tricks upon
travellers” by the savage, Bus-men of the West, will be
*. as the Police Commissioners will fix the fares,
and one may then leave home in the morning with some
confidence that after having paida fair price to go into town,
it will not be necessary pay double the sum to get
back again by the same conveyance.
A Cool Dog.
GENERAL Fox complains to the Times that the Great
Northern refused to forward a setter, which he wished to
send to Newcastle-on-Tyne, unless the : Was ked
in a per. This precautionary stipulation, though
rather vexatious, was not unreasonable, perhaps, in the
dog-days: but when the Company required that the dog
should be packed in a hamper, they might as well have also
insisted on having him packed in ice.

The above rate to be materially increased, if a person is going in a hurry to a railway, or is
returning home late at night, and also on all special occasions, such as QUEEN’s Birthdays,
Easter and Whitsun Mondays, Horticultural and Botanical, Fée days, and all illumination
nights, and likewise at all times when it should happen to be hailing, snowing, or raining.
n the event of a dispute as to distance, the ground to be measured at the expense of the
person disputing the Cabman's word, and a sum of two pounds to be paid into Court as a
guarantee for the result thereof.
Clause the Thirteenth enacts that, in all matters of dispute, whether the Cabman shall be

ve shillings, for his loss of time.
Every person, beyond two, to be charged at the rate of a separate fare.
pº,to be charged according to weight, at the same rates demanded by the Parcels'
elivery Uompany.
Back Fare to be paid on all occasions, and to be doubled after twelve o'clock.
. the next Clause it is enacted, that ladies are to be charged one-half as much again as
gentlemen (this clause has been objected to as being rather stringent, and oppressively
severe, but when it is considered the trouble that ladies give, and how they always object to
pay what a Cabman asks of them, and how §. always keep the Cabman . with their
useless arguments and frivolous complaipts, it is but right that the Cabman should be protected
against all such contingencies, and be allowed something extra for his unfeeling waste of time).
Babies, if taken, to be charged each as a separate fare, or else weighed as juggagé,
according to the option of the Cabman.
In no case is the fare to have the power of appeal against the Magistrate's decision.
There are several minor clauses, but we think we have shown enough of the New CAB
ACT to prove that if only one-half of it is carried out, we shall have not only the Cabmen
better protected, but also a better and more respectable class of riders in cabs.

THE CABMAN AND HIS GOOD AND EVIL
REPORT.
THE Reporter of the celebrated Bow Street Cab Case has written to
the Times and to us (our letter is sealed with the official seal of the
Court) to contradict the contradiction which was given in the House of
Commons to his report of the case of PHILLIPs the cabman, who would
not or could not put down five shillings for measuring the distance of
a fare with respect to which he was charged with an overcharge.
The Reporter º to our sense of justice—a tribunal to which
nobody ever appealed in vain; but we cannot see that any injustice
has been done, and therefore the appeal can only meet with a dismissal.
The Reporter and the *...; are at issue in their statements of
what took place, but the former's contradiction of the latter had not
been published when our article, was at press; and, it been, we
certainly see no reason why we should believe one party to the discredit
of the other. That reporters are fallible, we know by the frequency
with which their inaccuracies are corrected; and we fear, the Reporter
in question is capable of making a mistake, for he informs us that
“years ago” his “Bow Street reports led to the dismissal of a very
incompetent magistrate” (which may be possible), “and to the appoint-
ment of MR. HENRY as his successor,” which is utterly incredible. We
need not waste words in pointing out the absurdity of the assumption
that the report of what was being done by a magistrate at one court,
could in the smallest degree conduce to the appointment of any other
; though the publicity given to any \mproperacts of the former
miñº lead to his dismissal. -
conclusion, we have only to say that the Magistrate gives
one version of the affair, and the Reporter, gives another. . Neither
magistrates nor reporters are infallible, and we must therefore leave
the public to decide for themselves which of the two has, on this occa-
sion, been accurate. The Reporter lays some stress—and with some
show of reason—on the alleged fact, that his statement of the case is
supported by a note in the minute-book kept by the clerk, and pried
into, as it seems, rather unceremoniously by the Reporter; but if a
magistrate is liable to err, it is possible that his clerk inay be capable of
error. Having performed an act of justice, by recording the protest
of the Reporter against the impeachment of his accuracy, which we
noticed last week, we have done with the subject. - -
A learned Assistant Judge, while trying a boy for stealing a pudding,
summed up thus :—“Here's the pudding; up pops the y, off .
the pudding, and after him goes the policeman. You've got the bºy,
the pudding, and the policeman before you, and now, Gentlemen of the
Jury, consider your verdict.” In like manner, we say to the public,
“You have got the report, the Reporter, and the Magistrate before you;
therefore, Gentlemen of England, consider your verdict.”
BAD BEER WITH A GOOD NAME.
From the report of a recent case in the Rolls Court, it appears that
some rogues have been putting damaged Prestonpans Ale into bottles
labelled with the names of Messrs. BAss and Messrs. Allsopp, and
selling the stuff under these false titles “at fairs and races.” We
suspect that this trick is too common. You meet, occasionally, with
beer thus labelled, by which, no doubt, those firms are libelled; for it
is a libel on respectable brewers to impute bad beer to them: and the
sort of bitter beer we allude to is bitter bad. We call it beer, indeed;
but we no more believe that it is made of malt and hops than that it is
brewed by Allsopp or by Bass, whose names appear on the bottles, it
is sold in, but, to give a correct idea of their contents, ought to be
altered to BASE and ALLSLOP.
“Time was made for Slaves."
The present policy of Nicholas is an illustration of the truth of
this. For all he wants for Russians is time; a commodity that our
Cabinet seems disposed to allow any quantity of.

THE UNPROTECTED FEMALE IN WANT OF
A CAB,
ScENE:-The Great Western Railway Station on , the morning ºf
Wednesday, July 27th. A Train has just arrived, bringing, inter
alios et alias, The UNPROTECTED FEMALE, with her usual moderate
but miscellaneous accumulation % luggage, consisting of a hair-trunk
profusely brass-lettered, and without the slightest lifting appliance in
the way of handles; a cubical black bor, with a conver top, rery
apt to give way (like its mistress) on slight propocation, and trust.
ing much for support to a net-work ºf curiously knotted cordage;
an oblong contricance of wicker-work and oilskin, like a chicken-
basket in a tarpaulin overcoat ; a flower-pot, with a halsam in full
blow ; a basket, much too small for its work; four distinct parcels,
of respectable dimensions and irregular form, tuco in brotch paper,
one in a newspaper, and the fourth securely sewed up in huckaback ;
a large stone bottle of real mushroom ketchup; a pair of strong
shoes, which having obstinately refused to enter the hair-trunk, hare
been brought up by hand; an aged, but still expansive, carpet-bag,
bursting with its contents; a bonnet-bor and an umbrella, with a
parasol and a camp-stool. As the Scene opens, THE UNPROTECTED
is discovered in the act of reclaiming and gathering about her, with
her usual distractedness, these her goods and chattels, as they are
landed from the Luggage-Wan, in the midst of a growd §ſ all ages,
seres, and conditions, occupied in the same cay. The Porters
have an embarrassed air, and not a Cah is to be seen on the Stand.
Sharp-witted Passengers, who have rushed off to secure “first Cab,”
stand bewildered on the edge of the Platform. , Ladies are huddled
helplessly together, ruefully ºp their baggage. Indignant
individuals are asking questions ; and the possession of every inch
of room in two fortunate Omnibuses is being fiercely contested,

not uttered even a cry or an exclamation, but sits helpless and
hopeless, amidst a barricade of her luggage.

A NEW CHAPTER
IN THE ROMANCE OF KING ARTHUR.
Showing how the Round Table moved of its own accord, and of the terrible Adventure of the Rapping Spirits, and how Sun LANCELot took
upon him the quest of a Medium.
LoRDINgs, who a milder folly than your fathers knew have found
And, where they had pushed the bottle, only push the table round;
Gentle (ay, and simpſe) Ladies, who, when Rapping Spirits come
To relieve the weary, dreary tedium of the rout or drum,
pt in admiration listen, half in wonder, half in fear,
Lest there should be “something wicked” mingled with a sport so dear;
, who, with show of reason, gainst all reason can discourse
ideo-motor systems, motive wills, and vital force;
Dupes of every age and clime, whate'er your station, sex, or years,
Lend me all your strength of credence, all your wondrous length of ears,
Whilst of things that in the old time in KING ARTHUR's court befel,
Till his very table moved, a veritable tale I tell.
Good KING ARTHUR had a custom, whence he swerved not in the least,
That the ". should bring the tourney, and the noon should bring
the feast,
For he knew his knights, aye ready for the battle or the board,
Were as prompt § knife and cleaver as with battle-axe and sword,
With the same good will would carve a haunch and cut a foeman down,
And with equal satisfaction crack a marrow-bone or crown;

Thus in Camelot around the great loo table in the hall
Just thrice º were daily ranged by KAYE the Seneschal,
Whilst KING ARTHUR in the centre of the table took his seat,
That he might the better notice if his knights were off their mcat.
'Twas a sultry day in summer: e'en the castle's massive walls
Could not keep the heat from out the lofty corridors and halls:
Qpen were the doors and windows (partly for the sake of air,
Partly that the baser people might behold them dining there,
For in high baronial state but little pleasure would there be
If a crowd of reverential paupers were not there to see),
And the sunlight, pouring through them, on the shining armour gleamed,
Gleamed on . the banners bright that over every chieftain streamed,
Gleamed upon the golden flagons, and the monarch's flashing sword
Laid before him, and his silver beard down flowing on the board.
Floating in there came a murmur, of the trees that whispered near,
Of the river babbling to the reeds in accents low but clear,
Of the birds, and of sweet silver voices from the green alcove
Where GINEvra and her maidens prattled of their champions' love.
Silent were the knights, and in that happy meditative mood,
Which an ample meal induces, each his brother warriors viewed,

Two or three upon the wall came, ere “of MERLIN,” he could say. '
Then SIR LANCELot stepped before him, as the echoes died away.

Said hc. “Wherefore to accomplish this adventure I shall claim.
I will take my horse and spear and journey down to Caer Lud,
Where "LINETTE, the damsel sauvage,” dwells beside the Fleet's clear

All the meaning of this marvel she shall tell, and let me see
All the glories of the future, and the wonders that shall be.
Ho! Sir Butler, bring me quickly four men's shares of wine and meat,
That, as much as may suffice me for my journey, I may eat.” -
Seemed to him, as forth he journeyed, that the land was passing
strange;
Was it sooth, or was it glamour that had worked so great a change?
For the moorland and the woodland, where with horse, and hound, and

Now and then athwart his course came, with a rumble and a scream,

WANTED, A NOBLEMAN 1
WE have for some time looked with much curiosity to

in connection with certain pills which were warranted to
cure bad legs, black-legs, and all sorts of legs of every

the pill and ointment business should have fallen off
since the death of the Earl, who was advertised as a living
specimen of the benefits to be derived from cramming
himself with the one, and saturating his skin with the
other, we can only recommend the proprietor to put into
girculation the following Advertisement, with the attrac-
tive heading of
“WANTED, A NOBLEMAN ?"
Wanted, a Nobleman' ready to fill
His noble inside with a º: Pill.
He must have a ...; digestion, and Gout,
With an abscess internal, that ought to come out;
He must suffer from Headache, Consumption, and pains
In the nerves, and the elbows, the eyebrows and brains;
He must also have tried every doctor in town—

ROWN.
But vain must have proved all professional skill,
Till he heard, quite by chance, of the Popular Pill.

From his head to his foot, from his nose to his knees;
With *ś Deafness, and Mumps,
Sciatica, Fº ntiasis, fumps,
The Blues, Yellow Jaundice, the Red Gum, White

Confining him just twenty years to his dwelling,
And making him pay many doctors a bill-
Till a friend recommended the Popular Pill.
Wanted, a Nobleman' ready to swear,
Qf cure or improvement he’d learned to despair;
When i friend, whom he'd known fifty years at death's
00r,
Whose family long since had given him o'er
Ran into his chamber with laughter's wild shout;
As he gaily continued to caper about
Declaring he owed it to taking his

Wanted, a Nobleman ready to munch
The Popular Pill between breakfast and lunch;
He must take it at bed-time, at sun-rise, at noon,
At the fall of the leaf, at the full of the moon;
If a noble there is, who’s disposed to fulfil
The office of puffing the Popular Pill,
And will of its virtues incessantly speak,
His salary will be a guinea a ". !

PostERITY will scratch his head when he meets with the
subjoined passages whilst studying the Parliamentary in-
telligence in an ancient file of the Times. MR. C. BERKELEY
moving the House into Committee on the Expenses of
Elections’ Bill, said
“It was now a Bill merely to prevent the use of bands, bell-ringing,
and colours at elections.”
After some remarks by MR. CowPER against the Bill,
“Colonel Sibthoare then rose to move, in pursuance of notice, that
the Bill be deferred for three months. He said he had read the Bill
carefully over, and he º: he had designated it as it deserved, when
called it a mean, low, dirty bill. ğ...?
on a former occasion he h
It was a dangerous and delusive measure; ſt was a trap set for unwary
men, who might suddenly find themselves to have been guilty of an
offence which they had no intention of committing . . . . it restricted
the liberty of the subject . . . .”
However, the House went into Committee on the Bill;
and the Colonel took the opportunity of renewing his
protest against it: declaring that
"He would oppose the Bill in every stage, for he regarded i
disgraceful, mean, dirty, shabby º ge, t as a
after the odd remark had been made by MR. F. Scully,
a
“With regard to the carrying of flags and banners, he had no doubt
that in England such services were frequently made the means of
corruption,'
The report proceeds to state that
“SIR. J. GRAHAM thought the best course would be to give up this Bill, and proceed as soon as
possible with the next order on the paper, the Lunatics' Care and Treatment Bill."
Proceed with the nert Bill—the Lunatics' Care and Treatment Bill? How the
nert Bill? A Bill on the showing of which it appears that certain poor creatures
were in the habit of ; about trumpeting, mming, bell-ringing, carrying
flags—enacting such fooleries as these—on the solemn occasion of electing a
Member of Parliament; of contributing a philosopher to the Collective Wisdom;
a Bill in reference to unfortunates corruptible by means of flags and banners:
how, a rational Posterity will ask, cºld this have been a previous Bill to the
other? Must not what was called the next Bill, have been, in fact, , merely the
next clause of the same Bill; a general measure relating to the care and treatment
of lunatics?
CoLoREL Sibthorpe's denunciations of the proposed enactment will not, perhaps,
tend very much to prevent Posterity from taking this view of the case.

EARLY on the above day, Mr. Punch received
a note from his friend, LoRD PALMERSTON,
apprising him that such a deputation was
expected at the Home Office, and asking
him to “come down.” Mr. Punch, who
is always ready to come down in a good

indeed add, that from the disgraceful state
of Whitehall (proverbially the worst
swept, kept, drained, and watered street in
London), Mr. Punch, was laughingly
charged by his noble friend, on entering,

Nosey was to be heerd, it was all Queer Street.” The vulgar party was

THE TEA-TOTAL MOVEMENT. rºw
THE Tea-totallers—whose zeal we much admire, though we cannot
rush into the cistern or hang on to the }. with all the ardour they
ydraulic pressure to bear on
ublic opinion-hayeº a sort of sum of their achievements.
F. have forwarded “30,000 letters” to noblemen, &c., from which
we infer that they have filed at least 300 waste-paper baskets, and
furnished wrappers to several thousand quarters of Fº of, butter.
They have #. hundred “tea-meetings,” and they might have
added, “munched a million muffins,” to say nothing of the consump-
|tion of crumpets, which must have been something marvellous. They
have delivered some thousands of lectures on water, and have probably
exhausted a great many highly respectable pumps in the operation.
We find from a prospectus, that the hot days of August are about to
be refreshed by a flood of American eloquence, which is about to be
“turned on ” at Exeter Hall, through the medium of a MR.Gough,
of whom it is said that “he makes strong men to weep like littl
children, and women to sob as if their hearts would burst.” This
command over the tears of his audience is an º attribute to
one whose mission is to popularise water; and there can be no doubt
that when every eye around him is º: with moisture, he will feel
himself quite in i. element.... If he bears out the reputation he
rings with him, his lectures will be no laughing matter; for he is, as
it were, º to set all the men and women off into so many water-
ing-pots, by drawing from them such a series of wailings and sobs, as
will not only drown the voice of the orator, but threaten even
to drown those who are assembled to hear him. We hope the
Trustees of Exeter Hall will see to the drainage of the building before
these orations come off, or we do not know what may be the result
of a combination of several thousand floods of tears with the orator's
flood of eloquence.
THE REAL SMOKE NUISANCE.
WE must confess that our º to the Smoke Nuisance does not
extend so much to the honest chimney-pot of private life, or to the tall
smoke-evolving structure of manufacturing industry, as to that useless
and disgusting object, the street smoker, who puffs his “cheap, and
nasty’ cigar in the faces of innocent passengers. We sincerely hope
that Lord PALMERston will render it imperative on those offensive
locomotives to consume their own smoke in some way or other. The
are usually of a class that may be got to swallow almost anything, an
we would therefore suggest that they be called upon to swallow their
own smoke, for in the event of there being no other outlet, their mouths
are always open to them.
Most Musical, Most Diplomatic.
W.E are particularly happy in being, the first to state that the EARL
of WESTMöRELAND, our illustrious ambassador at the Court of Vienna,
is busily engaged composing a new March of Intellect for the EMPEROR
OF AUSTRIA.
The EUROPEAN CONCERT.
THIs Concert, which has been going on now for several years, most
harmoniously, is likely to be disturbed by the fact of Russia, who is,
really, very clever on the base, wishing to play first-fiddle.

A CHANCE FOR THE POOR CLERGY.
It is certainly scandalous that there should be any sale of livings
thºugh if the practice must exist, we are happy to find that a “ good
living” may be bought for a sum within the crippled means of a poor
clergyman, who has not, yet exhausted the ‘. of his begging and
borrowing resources and energies. The annexed advertisement will,
we trust, attract the attention of the sons of the clergy who may be
induced to confer the “good living” on one of the thousands of poor
parsons whom the clergy's sons c the especial privilege of aiding
and comforting. The advertisement is copied literally from the Times
newspaper.
GOOD LIVING-To be SOLD, a new PATENT MANGLE, by
Baker, with good business attached, suitable for any industrious person desirous
of obtaining a respectable livelihood. Price £12. Apply at, &c.
There is a “good living” to be had for twelve pounds, and it is
evidently, a much better thing than the average run of small curacies,
for it will enable a person to obtain “a respectable livelihood.”
We are glad to find that the condition of the poor clergy is at length
being looked aft in its proper light, and that a good mangle may be
advertised as a “good living” so as to catch at once the eye of the clerical
class to whom the owner of the mangle has evidently addressed himself.
We shall really begin to hope that the wretched condition of the under-
ſº cl an is beginning to “take a turn,”, if we can find in
werend hands a few mangles with “good livings” attached to them.

THE TAILOR ASSASSIN.
AN º French tailor has been charged, on the evidence of our
old friend Joinville, with a conspiracy to assassinate our old enemy
Louis NAPOLEoN. The “cons iracy” looks very like an attempt on
our gracious QUEEN, for the appy wretch of a tailor wanted HER
MAJESTY's head on twenty É of gold coin, and his º Was
directed far more upon English sovereigns than upon French
Napoleons. Twenty pounds was the price to be charged by the
French tailor for making his country free and happy; but, considering
that the trade of patriotism is rather at a low . just now, we cannot
§ thinking that the unfortunate humbug placed his services at too
hiº ſº
hether the accused really contemplated the murder of Louis
NAPOLEON, is doubtful, though MR. BoDKIN was engaged to argue that
the tailor designed the quietus of the Emperor with, perhaps, “a bare
Bodkin,” which, being the instrument of his trade, might have been
the intended instrument of his iniquity. Our private opinion of the
matter is that the French vagabond, instead of wishing to shed the
blood of the present ruler of France, was anxious only to make the
PRINCE DE Joinville “bleed” to the tune of twenty sovereigns.
Instead of elevating the scamp into a political conspirator, it "...i.
better to treat him at once as a swindler and a would-be obtainer of
money under false pretences. There is no greater “mistake” than to
assign political motives to a merely mercenary act, and to arraign as a
monster, who would have murdered an Emperor, a poor insignificant
adventurer who, though utterly hopeless of a “clean shirt,” may have
aspired to the chance of "a guinea.”

You scarcely ever receive change for a sovereign without finding
that one of the shillings or sixpences has had a hole drilled throug
it, "...— ...; a painful doubt as to the exchangeable value of
the coin-is altogether a bore. We are glad that WILSON has
got leave to bring in a bill to prevent the defacing of the QUEEN’s

one of the greatest evils of change.
THE RETURN TO DUTY.
BY A VERY MILD CABMAN.
RECALCITRATION, WILLIAM, cease;
JAMEs, we’ll return to work in peace:
Alas! the struggle to prolong
Were useless—would be, therefore, wrong.
The Legislature and the Press,
Whom Heaven—although they’ve wronged us-bless.
Have triumphed by superior force:
Submission now should be our course.
And though defeated, after all,
Our loss, in fact, will be but small;
A slight reduction of our fare,
Which our proprietors will bear.
Employment will increase, besides; .
Our friends will take more frequent rides,
And that will amply compensate
For payment at a lower rate.
Whilst o'er our tongue respect presides,
And courtesy our manner guides,
Of temperance let us own the sway,
And that of cleanliness obey.
Of insult or extortion, none
In terror, then, our cabs will shun;
Perhaps ev’n ladies then will dare
To constitute themselves our fare.
And oh, divesting our pursuit
Of altercation and dispute,
- How much more pleasantly shall we
Discuss our toast, and sip our tea!
All the Difference.
However much the Whigs may be found fault with for
their acts of omission, they are perfectly clear about their
acts of Commission, for we believe it is indisputable that
they have passed more acts that have saddled the country
with Commissions than any other Government.

THE POPULAR LAURIE BALLAD
THERE is a song to which we have alluded before, called “Annie
Laurie,” being sung at all the Mansion House dinners; and though
ANNIE is the name in common use, there can be no doubt that PETER
is the party whom the ballad is º to flatter. We have there-
fore engaged our own Laureate in the graceful task of fixing on the
head of the LAURIEs the honour which had been conferred on ANNIE,
by a poet evidently unconscious of the “coming” Alder-‘man.”
The Mansion House is bonnie when dinners are not few ;
And it’s there that PETER LAURIE gave me his promise true,
Gave me his promise true that I his guest should be;
And for Old SIR PETER LAURIE I’d lay me doun and dee.

MR. PETERLOO BROWN'S EXAMINATION OF THE
OXFORD STATUTES.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH, - -
“I APPEAL to you in a case of difficulty, and trust that my
familiarity will not beget your contempt. My name is BROWN: not
an uncommon surname, perhaps, but I am distinguished by º
hristian name of PETERLoo. y eldest lad is called after me, and it
is in his behalf, Mr. Punch, that I crave your advice. He is at present
an Eton boy, but he will soon be ready to be an Oxford man, and I am
now looking forward to his matriculation. You are, doubtless, Sir,"
aware that every, one who goes through that form has to subscribe to
certain oaths and conditions, before he can be admitted to the rivileges
of the University. I myself never had the benefit of a University
education, but I am well aware how it helps a man to gain a position
in society—a position which my rapid rise to fortune only in part
secured to me; for there are,
up their noses at us aristocrats by wealth, and yet will stoop to-
however, to return to my son. I am determined that he shall not
want for advantages; but, as I have a certain sort of squeamishness
about a person taking oaths that he does not know the meaning of,
and swearing to observe statutes of whose nature he is unaware, I
sent to Oxford for a º of the University Statutes, that I might run
my eye over them, and see what were the laws that governed the
noble, the great, the famous, the-in short, the enlightened place,
the University of Öxford. The book
is now, before me:— Parecholar sire
Ercerpta e corpore Statutorum Uni-
versitatis Oroniensis:’ and a copy is,
I believe, presented to every under-
graduate at his matriculation, that he
may be fully aware of the laws that
he has sworn to obey. The Statutes
I find to be written in a Latin form
—I cannot say, in a dead language,
for it is of a kind very much resembling
the living, and of that description
vulgarly termed ‘Dog” Latin; so that
I, who never got further than
Eutropius, and whose acquaintance
with the language has become rusty
from want of use, can easily make out
a translation of the sentences. I find
that my son will have, to sign the
Thirty-nine Articles, which, I dare
say, is all very proper; take the Oath
of Allegiance, which is quite right;
and also, the Oath of Supremacy, in
which he will have to say, that he,
PETERLoo BRowN, does, ‘from his
heart, abhor, detest, and abjure, as
impious and heretical, that damnable
doctrine and position that Princes,
excommunicated or deprived by the
Pope, or any authority of the See
of Rome, may be deposed or murdered
by their subjects, or any other what-
soever.' Now, although I may be
secretly of opinion that my lad might
as well swear to any Bosh, as all this
about the excommunicate Princes, yet I pass this over, and proceed to
the Statutes themselves. - -
“I find that a great part of the book is about the keeping of terms;
the granting of *ś of degrees, of congregations, convocations,
dispensations, and all that sort of thing; and I then, come-under the
head"Tºxiv. 7), Westitu et Habits Scholastico’—to the Statutes
that more immediately concern my son PETERLoo. And this is the
result of my search.
“I find that nobody, unless, he is a Peer's son-(who may do what
he likes, for you º find, Mr. Punch, that it is one of the great
beauties of our University system, that it allows no distinction of
rsons, but puts the sons of the ignoble and the noble on equal terms;
É. I am . !)—I find ‘Statutum est,’ that “Nobody shall wear
any other clothes than those of a black, or “subſusk” colour' (coloris
nigri aut subfusci), “or imitate (in their dress) what is extravagant or
fast:' (that seems to be the meaning of the words fastum aut lurum;’
but, as I said before, my Latin is rather rusty). Now, since this is
the rule, I would ask how it is, Mr. Punch, that łº BELLINGHAM
GREY (my neighbour's *) should, at the end of every term, bring
home from Christ Church (where by the way, he is ruining his father,
but that is no affair of mine /) suits of clothes of every colour but
black or ‘subfusk” (not that I exactly know what colour that may be),
and remarkable solely for their extrav ce and ‘fast-ness?' I want
my lad to dress like a gentleman, but I don't always want to see him

Mr. Punch, aristocrats by birth, who turn

continually clothed in “an inky suit of black.” And, if he swears to
observe such a Statute as the
above, why, of course, the autho-
rities will see that he obeys it, and
dresses accordingly.
“It is next ordered, that
“Nobody shall follow that absurd

‘Oxford Shoes,’ and that this
Statute has been inserted to keep
up what is, doubtless, the staple
trade of the city. For of course,
the statute is observed, or they
would not make the students
swear to obey it.
“‘Statutum est,’ also, that

ask you, Do you think that this
misfortune, which it is evident
can be from no fault of his own, will shut him out from all the
privileges of the University . It is a momentous question for a father
to make, and one which may interest the bosom friend of the present
Chancellor-I mean MR-I beg his pardon, DR. Disraeli. One thing
is plain; that the advertisements of “Do you want luxurious hair?’ can
be of no use in Oxford, and that bears'-grease must be at a discount.
And if my son PETERLoo should fail to observe any of the above
Statutes touching ºnal appearance, or the giving himself airs, he
will, when he is a graduate,
have to pay 6s. 8d. for each
offence (paena 6s... et 8d.
plectatur, toties quoties), and
while he is an under-
graduate he will, for such
offences, have to suffer cor-
poral º (parna

Mr. Punch, Ihave read that
the great NEwton was
horsed when he was a
Cambridge undergraduate;
but I thought that such a
degrading custom was either
confined to that University,
or had passed away with &
the dark ages, and oil-lamps,

I thought such disgrace only attached to the army. For, of course,
the corporal punishment cannot be inflicted only in the Statutes.
“I then find that it is ‘Statutum est,’ that if any one should happen
to introduce a new and unwonted style of dress, that the Vice-

WHAT IS A MILE
We think that the question of “What is º question
which promises to swallow up in interest the Eastern º and
all other questions which as yet remain unanswered—should be settled
as soon as possible; for, until it is settled, we shall never be able to
arrive at a proper settlement of the Cab fares. This settlement is due
—not only to the persons who ride in cabs—but to those who drive
them, for there are so many varieties of a mile, and so many different
ways of measuring it, that it is impossible to say which is the right
one. For instance—
If a young º walks round the corner of the street in which she
ives, she comes home quite fatigued, and “is sure she has walked
more than a mile.” - -
If a husband is dragged—a little against his will—to a certain street
where there happens to be a bonnet shop, though it is not more than
twenty yards, he is morally certain “he has been taken a mile out
of his way, if he has been taken an inch.”. .
It is curious the number of miles a mother-in-law has walked when
she feels desirous, poor creature, of having a cab. . .
..Besides, miles vary so much. A mistress's mile is generally very
different tº a servant's—a master's to a clerk's. Auctioneers’ miles are
º very short, ones when they are describing a property as
eing not more than “an omnibus distance from town,” or when
they are enlarging upon the merits of a Villa that is “only an easy
drive from a railway station.” Travellers' miles, on the contrary, are
fº very long ones. You will hear a delicate young man, who
as just returned from a pedestrian tour, boast of having walked
his "two thousand, miles,” just as if he had trailed a pedometer
behind him, and had measured every inch of the road. Panoramas
also, have a very elastic method of stretching out a mile, which
cab-drivers º doubtlessly not º: to adopt as, their own
particular standard of measurement. They talk very º of being
‘three miles long,” whereas, if the distance came to be measured, it
would probably turn out to be—like cabmen's distances generally—not
more than half. There is another deficiency, too, that frequently occurs
with the mileage question. We have known a distance, that when a
party first went over it, was only four or five miles, become suddenly
increased to eight or ten at least, when the same º
a dinner party—had to go over it again on their way back, is diffi.
culty has been felt so strongly at times, that every one of the party has
preferred—at that late hour-stopping where he was, instead of
walking home all that distance. These unnecessary difficulties impera-
tively call for a speedy answer to the puzzling question, “What is a
Mile?” for hitherto the question has been passed over by our Police
magistrates, from one parish to another, like a pauper, for the want of
a settlement. -

And there comes claws eleven, and claws a 'onest man to pris'n.'
Then see the “rates” in Sheddle A, vy vot a shame it is
To drag two fat uns near a mile, and only git a tiz!
Now s'pose a twelve-stun fare comes up and takes me off the rank,
And makes me drive him, pretty sharp, from Smiſfield to the Bank;

He sticks into me claws seventeen, and finesſme forty bob!

And, if he says it isn't clean, my license he may grab;
And arterwards, if I but “use” my own cab, Y. pay,

EXHIBITION OF POLITICAL INDUSTRY.
THE honourable and gallant Member for Lincoln has reason for com-
plaining that there is no prospect of the outlay upon the New Houses
of Parliament being finished. The outlay will not be finished before
the Houses are—Victoria Tower and all; and when we see what pro-
s is being made with the Crystal falace at Sydenham, we cannot
ut think how desirable it is that those edifices, and, indeed, the whole
Parliamentary concern should have been got up by a Houses of Parlia-
ment Company. . If that had been the case, the edifices would not only
have been long since lighted, ventilated, and decorated, but the thing
would now be a paying property. Such it might easily have been ren-
dered by making the galleries larger, and admitting the public at so much
a head—say playhouse prices—which crowded audiences doubtless would
be willing to give, in order to hear the º: Besides, the Members
might have been required to pay for their seats, and the revelations

Whiskey above Proof.
WE suppose that the principal objection of the Irish priesthood to
the ARchbishop or DUBLIN's Christian Evidences as a national school-
book, is, that if the pupils were allowed to have the truth of
Christianity proved to them, they would also want proof of everything
else that their Reverences tell them to believe.

A CAROL 0N CAROLINE CHISHOLM.
CoME, all you British females of wealth and high degree,
Bestowing all your charity on lands beyond the sea,
l'll point you out a pattern which a better plan will teach
Than that of sending Missioners to Tombuctoo to preach.
Converting of the Heathen’s a very proper view,
ByP. true religion to Pagan and to Jew,
And bringing over Cannibals to Christian meat and bread,
Unless they catch your Parson first and eat him up instead.
| But what's more edifying to see, a pretty deal,
| Is hearty British labourers partaking of a meal, -
With wives, and lots of children, about their knees that climb,
And having tucked their platefulsin, get helped another time.
Beyond the roaring ocean; beneath the soil we tre
You’ve º men and women, well housed and clothed
and 1601,
Who but for help and guidance to leave our crowded shores,
Would now be stealing, begging, or lie starving at our doors.
Who taught themself-reliance, and stirred them to combine,
And club their means together to get across the brine,
Instead of strikes, and mischief, and breaking of the law,
And wasting time in hearing incendiaries jaw
Who led their expeditions? and under whose command
Through dangers and through hardships sought they the
promised land? .
A second Moses, surely, it was who did it all,
it was a second Moses in bonnet and in shawl.
By means of one good lady were all these wonders wrought,
By CAROLINE CHISHOLM's energy, benevolence, and thought,
Instead of making here and there a convert of a Turk,
She has made idle multitudes turn fruitfully to work.
The ragged pauper crawling towards a parish grave
She roused—directed to a home beyond the western wave;
She smoothed his Nº. i. across the troubled deep,
With food, and air, and decencies of ship-room and of sleep.
There’s many a wife andmother will bless that lady's name,
|Embracing a fat infant—who might else have drowned the
Same,
A mother, yet no wife, compelled by poverty to sin,
And die in gaol or hospital of misery and gin.
The REVEREND EBENEzer I’d not deny his dues
or saving Patagonians, and Bosjesmen, and Zooloos;
But MRs. CHIsholm’s mission is what I far prefer;
For saving British natives I’d give the palm to her.
And now that a subscription is opened and begun,
In order to acknowledge the good that she has done
Among that sort of natives—the most important tribe—
Come downlike handsome people, and handsomely subscribe.
OUR HONEY MOON.
—-
TUESDAY-MAY 28, 18–.
SHALL I ever forget the day? As it comes round—if I’m spared
for fifty years—I’m sure I shall always feel a chill, a pang at the
thoughts of it. That dear, foolish creature, FRED ! As if being shot
could make it any better! And then the thought—the horrid thought
would press itself-piercing like a dagger—to be sent into weeds in
one's very Honeymoon!
Of course, the whole house was raised. When Joseph.INE heard me
scream, and came to the bedroom door, and found it locked, and
couldn't make me sensible to open it—for I'd the key in my hand,
and so had dropt it on the floor when I fell myself in a swoon—
Of course, when Joseph INE could make nobody hear, she very soon
raised the house, and there were chambermaids and waiters at the door,
and they were breaking it open, when I came enough to myself to
revent it !
“It's all right
whit the worse, depend on't.”
“Safe! Are you sure?”—
“Certain, Ma'am. 'Cause the landlord has given information to the
constables, and no doubt on it, he says, they’ll all be in custody afore
they can shoot one another.”
“Shoot!” Well—for the moment—I did hate the creature as she
spoke the word; speaking it with all the coolness in life-death,
Ma'am,” said Josepui NE. “Master’s safe; not a
I †: say. ..
I hastily º something on: went into our room. Had up the
landlord, the ſandlady; and it really was wonderful—gave me for the
time quite a shock at human mature—to see how little they were moved
-in fact not moved at all-by my wretchedness, my downright misery.
“Oh,” Ithought, every otherminute, “if I once get him home again!”
And then the next moment, some horrid sight would come before me—
and no one, no one to help or advise me. Yes. The landlady counselled
me to have a cup of tea, and the landlord advised me to make myself
comfortable. "Things o' the sort”—he said—“never come to nothing
now-a-days. Besides, he’d given the word to the constables—and'ſ
might make myself easy they’d all be locked up in a jiffy.”
“Could he tell me.”—I asked—“the most likely road to take?”
“Why, no,” he said, ‘‘some folks took one, some another. Some
liked the cliffs, some the Devil's Dyke; but as he'd sent all ways, why,
again he assured me, I had nothing to do but to make myself
comfortable.”
And even as the horrid man said this, his more dreadful wife—not
but what the woman meant well; only I couldn't abide her for her
composure at such, a time—the woman came to me stirring a cup of
tea with, as she said, just a spoonful of brandy in it to settle my spirits.
What a thought! I to take tea with brandy in it, and FREDERIck
perhaps at that moment—
Joseph INE-I’ll do the girl so much justice at last—was running to
and fro, upstairs and downstairs—and putting the house, from one
end to the other, in a ferment. At last the landlady desired her to be
quiet, and not go about making noise enough to tear people out of their
beds. If all the world was gone out to be i. that was no reason why
their house should be ruined
Well, I won't attempt to describe the two hours I suffered! How,
sometimes, I thought I'd have a horse and go galloping anywhere,
everywhere.
“It’s all over, Ma'am!”—cried Joseph INE, running in.
“Over !” and I saw death in the girl's face.
… º Ma'am. They fired two shots, Ma'am—two a-piece—they
Yes—yes
“And master”—
“Killed !”—I screamed.
“No, Ma'am! Quite the reverse!”—
(How Ithanked the girl for the words, though where could she have
picked 'em up?)
“He has not killed his—I mean the-other gentleman?”—
“No, Ma'am, totally the contrary. Nobody’s hit—not so much as
winged, though what that means I can’t say—only I heard one of the
men say as much. But all of 'em in custody.”
“What now? Why, what for 2–’”
“Why, Ma'am, as I hear, for every one of the gentlemen to be
bound over to keep his peace for the rest of his born days! And la!
bless me—how ill you turn, Ma'am, and when it’s all over?”.
“Not at all, Joseph INE. I’m very well, now: very well, indeed;”

“Which makes it ten times wickeder,” said Joseph INE.
“And butcher him like a lamb,” said I.

difference, 'am; you know master isn't a bit hurt.
‘That has nothing to do with it. He might have been killed, and
what would MR. TRUEFENNY have cared? No! I might have been

“And much MR. TRUEPENNY would have helped you then, Ma'am,”
said the girl.

THE MILESTONE TREADMILL.
How to find fit work for convicts--work that shall at the same time
be serviceable to the Public, and shall not take the bread out of the
mouths of honest, men—is a question that nobody has yet answered.
Profound philosophers have sometimes got very near to the discovery
of the q ture of the circle, perpetual motion, the transmutation of
metals, the elixir of life, the crystallisation of carbon, the longitude.
They have almost succeeded; all but solved the problem; when, just on
the verge of the accomplishment of the great work, they find all their
profound calculations º: by some º superficial obstacle which
ihey had overlooked. Precisely, thus had we nearly attained to the
invention of aFº employment for convicted thieves: just so were
we confounded on the brink of success by a stumbling-block, which has

matter, Joseph INE” for I saw the creature look suddenly confused.
“Nothing, Ma'am—only I-I once saw that girl—a gipsey-girl,
Ma'am-with flowers, Ma'am; yes, to be sure.”
“Then you know her?” I asked.
“Can't say I know. Because one should hardly lower oneself to
know a creature of that sort. Only once, and perhaps twice, I’ve had
a º of her.” .

“If you please, Ma'am, and you'll not be angry, that letter”—said

tripped us up and flung us back again heels over head, alighting,
however, on the former, as we always do.
A communication in the Civil Service Gazette states the case of a
letter-carrier, in the Derby district, who has to walkabove 201miles a day,
and deliver letters at eleven villages. This amount of walking exercise,
allowing 15 minutes for delivery at each village, and 25 minutes for
refreshment, the writer calculates to be 8 miles an hour for 24 hours.
It reads like an achievement of running a fabulous distance and picking
up an incredible number of stones with the mouth, . That a man, might
match himself to attempt such a feat of pedestrianism for a limited
eriod and º conceivable; but this one does it daily for lls.
f course he has sent in his resignation; no free agent could continue
ºº ºch work on such terms. Only eleven shillings for all this hard
ur.
Hard labour. These two words are brilliantly suggestive-seem to
flash upon us the settlement of the convict employment question.
Hard labour—occupation toilsome and unremunerative; at the same
time useful; just the proper occupation for criminals. Rig out all our
rogues and thieves in blue and scarlet, turn them into postmºn,
# them six months, or upwards, of 8 miles an hour for several hours
aily letter-carrying. Mercury in Windsor uniform; messenger and
thief in one: on the turnpike treadmill—'tis a pretty idea, too, into the
bargain.
#. here up starts the difficulty. . It is peculiarly necessary, that a
postman should, before all things, be honest. By this trifling obstacle
is the magnificently specious scheme of substituting, Post Office
employment for the treadmill frustrated. The mounted police, and
other constabulary, might prevent the fellows from escaping, and keep
them in their routes; but could hardly hinder them from secretin
money and notes in stumps of trees, old walls, and other nooks an
corners, for concealment therein till the expiration of their sentences:
Whilst, however, there exists this objection to the emplºyment of
rogues as 5. there is nothing whatever, to forbid them from
employing themselves in that capacity. Hence the frequent abstraction
º f-sovereigns from letters; taxing the detective acumen of
MR. SculthoRPE. -
We see that a bumpkin of a Post Office messenger was tried the
other day at the assizes for making away with letters. He was an
ignorant clown; and he destroyed them simply that he might not have
#. trouble of delivering them. Alasfor our economy! Unfortunately
we can't give inadequate wages without being in danger of getting
either a knave for our servant or a fool. -
So we didn't quite set the Thames on fire; it won't do to make
letter-carriers of convicts: and as to the nuisance of having knaves
and fools amongst our postmen, there is evidently no help for that but
to raise the postmen's salaries.
Devotees in Cells.
MR. Lucas, the other evening, made a reasonable speech in the
House. He complained that the principle of religious equality, in
English prisons, was not sufficiently observed with regard to Roman
Catholic prisoners. A fair ground of complaint! By all means let
every Romanist convict enjoy his own conviction.

CAUTION TO TRAVELLERS DURING THE HOT WEATHER.
NEVER Go To SLEEP while You ARE HAVING Your HAIR CUT IN PARIs, or IT MAY BE cuT IN THE FIRST STYLE of FASHION.
(By a Distinct Observer.)
I HAD the advantage of inspecting the Review of the Fleet from a
peculiar point of view. Before me was an enormous volume of smoke,
which completely prevented me from seeing the vessels; it was, how-
ever, a volume in which I think I read ºf to the purpose.
There is, perhaps, hardly any mind wherein the tremendous roar of
1,076 §: the smallest of which are 32 pounders, and the largest
throw 68 it. shot and 84 it. shells, would not excite some degree of
emotion of some sort.
The boom of each Brobdignagian piece of ordnance inspired me with
a sum in mental arithmetic, which the immediate thunder of another
explosion prevented me from carrying out with strict accuracy. The
problem, however, was simple enough. So much noise, so much gum-
powder, so much money. So much money; so much taxation. The
scene—of smoke chiefly—was too sublime; the noise was too over-
whelming; perhaps I had also drunk too much, brandy, and water: to
admit of my CockeRING myself in exact calculation; but I ciphered
roughly in a mental soliloquy, thus:–
Bang! There goes the Income Tax. Bang! That's the Succession
Duty. Bang! Bang! That's the Stamp and Paper Duties. Bang!
# 5' Bang! There's the Assessed Taxes, Bom! ... the Malt Tax.
Pop! the Wine Duties. Pop-pop-pop! The rest of the Taxes on
Consumption.

prone, if it does not take care—no º to Chobham Camps
and Špithead Reviews-to amuse itself by playing at soldiers and

Of course it is necessary, to a certain extent, to discharge small arms
and to fire broadsides at nothing. But yet, “amid the joy and the
uproar ” of these imposing high jinks, it may be a useful exercise for
the mind of the spectator, if not too much clouded by powder smoke,
or other fumes, to count the cost of the cartridges, and compute the
dimensions of the hole which they blow in our pocket.
PARLIAMENTARY BULLETIN.
It is useless to affect any, further disguise with respect to the
condition of an Illustrious Body; or to the human certainty, almost,
of that melancholy event which nothing but some unlooked for
occurrence, or inconceivable change, in the Constitution, can, now
protract above a few days. The following Bulletin was issued this
morning:—
“St. Stephen's, August 18, 1853.

self, who sends all these conscience-moneys. We have long
a suspicion of this nature; firstly, because we never, see, an
return of these numerous sums of money entered in the Quarter's
Revenue; and, secondly, because we believe he does it to decoy others
to do the same. If you notice, these conscientious offerings are gene-
rally made in favour of the income-tax. Now, the CHANCELLOR OF
THE ExchEQUER knows very well that this tax is not a popular one.
He also knows that, on account of its unpopularity, there...is a very
large class of HER Tr's subjects who particularly dislike paying
it. Give them but a chance of evading the payment, and they do not
in the least scruple availing themselves of it. "We do not say whether
the practice, so pursued, is honest or not, but such is the fact!, The
Cºncerton of the Éxcheques, therefore, his every now and then

man who has been a defaulter with the fact of his non-payment. It is
only another way of saying to him, “Why don't you follow his example?
Look at A.B.; what a noble-minded fellow he is . By some accident he
has neglected to pay £50 for his share of the Income-Tax, and here, by
Jove, he has sent it! Now, if you have any conscience, you 1Inline-
diately do the same.” -
We cannot, say, whether any one, does send anything. A few
pounds may drop in occasionally, but we º that the majority
of the sums, sent in the name of A.B., or, X. Y. Z, and the other
popular initials of the alphabet, are forwarded by the CHANCELLOR

reluctant tax-payers to do that as a matter of “conscience,” whic
they will not do as a pleasure.

THE END OF QUACKERY.
AMONG the many novel systems of medicine for which the present
day is remarkable, there is one distinguished by a name that, at least,
seems very appropriate. It is called Coffinism. This is candid. The
term, however, is so comprehensive, that it might, with great correct-
ness, be applied to all manner of therapeutical schemes which deviate
from true medical science. There is one right method of treating
diseases, and there are many wrong ones; to all whereof the denomi-
nation of Coffinism is justly applicable; since it indicates, with
exactness, the tendency of each of them; every, improper way of
attempting to cure people being a path which leads to the “bourne
from which no traveller returns:” in short, which terminates in the
elm box.

MR. PETERLOO BROWN’S EXAMINATION OF
THE OXFORD STATUTES.
LETTER II.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH, -
“IN my last letter to you, I mentioned a few of the Statutum
ests of Tit. XIV.’ of the Oxford Statutes; and I now come to con:
sider “Tit. XW.’ of the same amusing work, premising that I shall
confine my remarks to this Tit, as it would be a task of insufferable
weariness—and one, I suppose, which like, the discovery of the source
of the Nile, no philanthropist would ever live to carry out—to attempt
to explore the twenty-one Tits., which, with their º branches,
run through that immense tract of paper intended for the use of the
academic youth (in usum, juventułis academica). But I may remark,
en passant, as our “lively neighbours’ say—(I don't know French,
Mr. Punch, but I like to quote it occasionally, as it shows, refinement
and education, and that you read the Morning Post, and all that sort
of thing)–I may remark, that for the Vice-Chancellor, to drive
twenty-one of these Tits. in hand, and * them well together, must
be no ordinary act of JEHU-ism; and I think it would have added
eatly to the effect of the late Commemoration, if they had put out
illustrated posters, that the new Chancellor, “acknowledged by the
Press to be the premier jockey of the day, and without a Peer in the
Westminster Circle,” would make his ‘first public entrance into
Oxford, driving. Twº NTY-ONE TITs IN, HAND !’ after which would, of
course, follow ‘the performances in the Theatre,’ with ‘the drolleries
of the Caucasian Clown, and ‘the laughable farce of The Phenomenon
in a Doctor's gown.' I think something might have been made of that;
but the hint may perhaps be taken against the next opportunity.
“Tit. XV. treats ‘De moribus conformandis; ” and it first orders that
all juniors should pay due respect to their seniors—their seniors that
is, in academical rank, for age does not come before dignity in Oxford
—the undergraduates to the B.A.'s, the B.A.’s to the M.A.'s, the M.A.'s
to the D.C.L.'s, and so on, according to the standing of the ‘Man of
letters; (a phrase which evidently refers, to those mysterious decima-
tions of the alphabet, which some people, delight to put after their
names). And the ‘due respect’ is to be shown, firstly, by *. up

says, “by uncovering the head at a proper distance,” (adjustum inter-
vallum caput aperiendo) though what this proper distance may be,
appears to be left to the taste of the capper, the rank of the cappee,
the force of the wind, the length of the arm, or any other directing
influence. ably the distance is measured by the relative dignity
of the wearers of the cap, so that an undergraduate would have to
uncover himself as soon as the Vice-Chancellor came in sight; and, in
the event of a dispute as to the proper distance, the matter would
probably be settled as they arrange similar differences of opinion
under the new Cab Act, and would be brought before the Vice-
Chancellor's Court, who would, doubtless, order the distance to be
measured. At any rate, it appears that my son PETERLoo will have to
learn to keep his distance, and this inclines me to think favourably of
this Statute; for I have always been of opinion (since I made money
} it) that there is nothing like bein -
showing them all that respect which they desire, even if they don't
deserve. But I am glad that the Oxford authorities enforce this
Statute by wisely ordaining that those who neglect the proper marks
of respect, shall be punished with, impositions, loss of terms, and the
setting down of their names in the |. Black Book, (in Libro
Nigro Procuratorum), which I have no doubt is the Bogy with which
the nurses of Alma Mater terrify and awe her refractory children.
But moreover, if they should still contumaciously persist in their
conduct, (si contumaces perstiterint), they shall be fined in addition, not
more than five pounds for each offence. It does not say what is done
with the money, but it probably goes towards purchasing a plaister for
wounded dignity.
I am rather curious to know how many undergraduates, B.A.’s, or
M.A.'s, were, during, the late Commemoration, castigated by the
Proctors (Procuratorihus ſº or fined this five pounds, or had

THE DOOM Ol' WESTMINSTER BRIDGE.
THE Act has at, length passed for the total destruction of West-
minster Bridge, and another bridge is to succeed, which, if it is §
to succeed, must be as unlike as possible to the existing bri e, whic
has been, a complete failure. The career of this bridge has been
downward from the first, and its continuance, has been a phenomenon
similar to that which is illustrated by the old saying that “a greaking
door hangs long upon the hinges.” Westminster Bridge has been, as
long as we can remember; “going, going, going,” and it has been a
matter of constant wonder that it had never yet “gone.” We have never
on traversing it been able to look, back upon it with the respect due
to “the bridge that carries us safely over.” for we have always felt
that the safety was due rather to good fortune than to any merit the
bridge itself had to rest upon. -
We cannot help .# delighted that an act of Parliament will at
last put this unhappy old bridge out of its misery, instead of sanctioning
the further infliction of the painful operations to which it has been
at one another. Some of the officers on board were very attentive, and
if I wanted to marry a man in uniform, I would sooner have the sea-
livery than the land. They are fresher, and much pleasanter to talk
to than the hardened army men, and really think more of you than the
other spoiled, creatures do. . It was quite delightful to see them fly
about to make you comfortable, doing things the soldier-officers, as
your dreadful child calls them, would faint at the idea of -except at

mutilated, but it is to be made away with once and for ever. It has
already undergone the process of trepanning, by having something
removed from its crown, and it has, long ago been able to boast of
nothing better than wooden legs, by the process of giving it timbers to
stand upon, as well as wooden arms, W e substitution of wood-work
for its old, original balustrades. ... We are delighted that the old
nuisance will not be suffered, to die in its bed, or rather in the bed of
the river, into which it daily threatened to tumble. Westminster
Bridge has, indeed, had a fair trial, for it has been tried by its piers,
and its condemnation has been the inevitable result, for its piers have
been, perhaps, the chief cause of its downfall.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAR1.
IMPORTANT MEETING
IMMENSE excitement prevails among an important class of manufac-
turers—those engaged in the manufacture of that atmospheric canopy,
the sable expanse of which extends over London and its environs,
serving the inhabitants of the whole metropolitan district as a parasol.
The cause of this commotion is the Smoke Nuisance Bill—so called;
ainst which a number of gentlemen, and others, professing the prin-
§. of Free Carbon, met last might to protest, at the Hole-and-
tner.
The chair having been taken by MR. Sutkins, the business of the
.commenced with uproar. Comparative silence having been
obtaine
MR. LoNGsHAFT, brewer, rose to move a resolution, that the principle
of the Smoke Bill was at variance with the constitution of England.
At Alime when Londºn was much mºre smoky than it is now, it was
said that “Liberty is like the air we breathe.” Could any atmosphere
be more salubrious than that air? Smoke, possessed curative pro-
perties, especially in reference to hams; and the very essence of smoke
was applied for the cure of kippered salmon. He had sent some bottles
of smoke from his own brew-house to a celebrated German chemist,
who had written him a certificate in the form of a letter, to the effect
that he had analysed the smoke, and found it to consist principally of
carbon, which possessed antiseptic properties; sulphurous and carbonic
acid gases: the former of which acted as a tonic, whilst the latter con-
stituted the enlivening element of bottled ale and stout, ginger beer
and soda water. The philosopher had accompanied this statement by
a declaration that he, for his part, liked the smoke as a perfume, and
would be glad to be º: with a few more bottles of it for his per-
sonal use. Hitherto this beautiful smoke had been allowed to waste its
sweetness on the London air, which was now threatened with the de-
privation of thats ar advantage... The loss of the smoke would not
affect him individually much, as he lived some distance out of town;
and could only indulge in a whiff now and then, when he went to his
place of business. He regarded the attack upon their chimneys as the
commencement of an invasion of their hearths; and exhorted all who
meant to defend the latter to rally round the former. (Great
applause.)
MR. Fun NELI, Captain of a Thames steamer, seconded the resolution,
In his situation he had good opportunities of hearing the expression of
public opinion, about the Smoke, Bill: , People said if Parliament
objected to volumes of smoke, why did they publish so many Blue
ks? If they wanted to prevent chimneys from puffing they shouldn't

emancipating Blacks abroad if they wasn't to enjoy freedom at home?
That was what the Public had to say, about the matter. For his part
he looked on the separation of fire and smoke as a unnatural diworce.
Consume his own smoke! Why they might as well ask him to consume
his own wife, Fire without smoke-by-and-bye, he supposed, it would
be bread without butter. What? he expected the next thing would be
}. scientific legislators would bring in a bill for dividing thunder and
ightning. He called this here Smoke Bill the Repeal of the Union,
A little smoke on the river was wholesome. . A stream that had
such a lot of sewers flowing into it required fumigation. He had
heard passengers returning from Kew Gardens talk about plants there
that lived upon air. In course, the more substance there was in the
air the more nutritious it must be both for wegetable and hanimal life.
Legislation was going too fast, Ease her!, stop her take a turn
astarn! As to this tyrannical and arbitrary Bill of LoRD PALMINSTER’s
for the consumption of smoke, he should give it every opposition: and
he hoped through their united efforts it would be brought to end in
that wery identical object it was directed agin. (Much cheering.)
MR. CowL had the honour to belong to a branch of the medical pro:
fession. His practice was the cure of smoky chimneys. He protested
against a measure which would deprive him of his º: ; and if the
Smoke Act was enforced he hoped at least he should receive
compensation.
MR. GENTLET was a producer of smoke. He supposed his interests
were affected by this measure, which required the producer to be also
the consumer, but did they call that political economy?, To be sure he
was not the proprietor of a chimney; but he possessed a nose: which
came to the same thing. The very occupation he pursued was that of
smoking. It was the employment of his life. It might not be a very
useful branch of industry: but it was, an ornamental one. They knew
by the smoke that so gracefully curled from the end of his weed that a
Pickwick was near. They knew that a gent of fashionable exterior and
elegant manners was nigh likewise. If he was obliged to consume his
own smoke, how could he continue to diffuse fragrance in society?
He identified himself with the party of smokers; as he was a smoking
. himself. If smoke was such a nuisance, why did they make so
much the other day at the review at Spithead?, Let them put that
question in their pipe—and, he would add, smoke it. Talking of pipes,
he would tell PALMERSTON that his idea of a chimney consuming its
own smoke was a mere sham.
[The speaker resumed his seat amid great laughter, principally from
#. , and the meeting terminated as it began, with clamour.

POR DON VELASQUEZ CROCKER, UN INGENIO DE ESTA CORTE.
THE manuscript of the following “True Discovery of Iximaya,” by
“a wit of this court.” (as the old Spanish dramatists would have said),
was brought to Mr. Punch's office, together with three pounds of
chocolate, and a box of º: by an unknown hand. r. Punch
forgives the mixed jargon of the verses, being moved thereto by the
integrity of the chocolate and cigars, which were entirely Spanish; but,
as his readers have not tasted of the one, or inhaled the fumes of the
other, he has employed, three of the best Spanish scholars in the
Foreign Office (placed at his disposal by LoRD CLARENDoN) to prepare
. annexed translations of his correspondent’s most recondite
pnrases.

hile the portly Mesofiero—platicanteel dinero
Detan rico forastero through his appetite to win–
Brought from out the meagre larder of his precious poor posada
A sabrosa Sazonada, mess of beans, in dripping fried;
I was mindful of a greasy Padre, very fat and wheezy,
Who, with action free and tºy came and sat him by my side;
Saying, “Senor por mi vida, i f share your slight §.
It is not because I need a meal, but that I ºf
Mi poquito de respeto portan principal sujeto.”
“Tan aſable y discreto Padre I am glad to know:
You are welcome, father,” said I; “my repast, you see, is ready,
So, if you will bless the bread, I gladly § the half resign.”
Thus we sat, some white wine sipping, and the pº bendito dipping
In the unctuous beans and dripping, till I said, “O ! Padre mine,
Prithee tell me sin engaños why your old ciudadanos
Twixt two large and fierce volcanoes chose to build this lordly town?”
to show
* The town stands between two volcanos: one of fire, the other of water.

“Ah! amigo muy amado!” said the Padre; “ALVARADO
Este lugar mas dichado chose betwixt each fatal spout

water
On the town from either quarter, one would put the other out.”
Then I said, “I’ve heard men say a town entitled Iximaya, .
Never seen by white man, lay a few leagues off behind the hills.
Is it true, Sir P” Said the Padre, “Por los ojos de mi madre
Vino con los contos cuadre!, Talking, dry-lipped, nothing skills.
Bring us, quick, some Ratafia and cigars, Dolores mia;
Manana sera otro dia; all to-night we’ll merry be.

'Twas from yonder high Sierra's cloud-encircled summit; where a

Struck by what the priest related, for a while I meditated
How to find if what he stated were the very truth, or no. -
Then I said, “You live so near it, that methinks 'tis somewhat queer it
Is not better known down here.” “It, Senor,” said he, “is not sol

Slily to Dolores winking, straight I left the Padre drinking,
R. departed quickly, thinking, “I will e a journey there.”
Soon I paid the Mesoilero; sought me out an Arrièro, .
Asked the road, and hired a º: o' steady mules and paid the fare.
Dificily peregrino se mostraba el camino;
Nunca Mulatero vino on that lonely road before;

Where the jaguar would be sure, as we appeared, to give a roar,
Por los montes y fuentes, §. sin puentes,
Where the alligator spent his leisure hours, on we bore;
Till the Mulatéro dying, I was forced to leave him, lying
Qn the mountain after trying circulation to restore.
Then for want of preparation for my novel situation
I was threatened with starvation; ate the very clothes I wore ;

Cené de las almohadas sodden in the streams. I past;
Till one day, desalińado, flaco, manco, fatigado,
I attained (Al desdichado') Iximaya's walls at last.

“WELL, FRANK I
THIS DELIGHTFUL CAMP Is NEARLY over.”

THE BOUNCE OF A PISTOL.
SIR. J. W. SHELLEY reads a circular in the House of Commons
summoning certain members to attend on a certain occasion for a
certain º purpose. , The document bears the signature of C.H.
FREwBN. It is couched in a spirit of low cunning, and tends to reflect
great discredit on its author.
C. H. FREwen writes to SIR. J. W. SHELLEY, demanding to
know from whom he had received this circular; a private letter
Prº iven to him in breach of confidence.
IR J.
. NHELLEY º that the circular was a printed document,
and therefore, not entitled to be considered private. .#
MR. C., H. FREwBN (who dates his letters from Cold Overton Hall
replies that, no matter for that, Qr in whatever way he got possesse
of it, the man who would read such a letter in such a way
“Can have no pretensions to call himself a gentleman.”
But stay. We do not say that all this is true. We only say that it
has appeared in the Times., For aught we know, the Times may be a
facetious contemporary, cracking jokes on the head of MR. FREwen, as
if it were a thick one. We do not mean to say that MR FREwBN made
such an ass of himself, as he did make, if his correspondence, as printed
in the Times, is genuine. But, however,
SIR. J. W. SHELLEY-always according to the Times, mind–rejoins
} desiring of MR., FREWEN that, the whole of the correspondence
should be published, as the first letter had been, and declining to
answer any more letters. And then:—
“MR. FREwen returns this letter unopened. SIR. J. ShellEY ought to be aware
that MR. FREwen cannot recoive auy more communications from him except through
another person.”
What does MR. FREwBN mean by this?--if the nonsense is his really?
Surely not the old bluster, the obsolete bullying trick; Chalk Farm,
pistols and coffee for two, with cock pheasant also if required for the
satisfaction of a gentleman desiring a bellyfull for breakfast. Not an
invitation to fight a duel; that ridiculous anachronism; the necessary con-
º: of which in these days, to the principal fools concerned in it,
each of them, must be gº; either shot, or imprisoned, or laughed at;
most probably the latter, . Shot by the other fool; imprisoned—if not
hanged—for shooting him; or laughed at for neither having shot
him nor been shot by him; but #. having simply exchanged
with him a blank pop! if Mr. Frºwes has indeed been such a
booby as it a *. in the Times that he has, Mr. Punch can only say
that he would recommend him to change the designation of Cold
Overton to that of Clod Hall, and to assume the name, together with
the arms, of Bob Acres.
HOMOEOPATHY SUPERSEDED.
HERE is a gross libel or a fine satire:-
EXTRAORDINARY ANTI-SURGICAL, OPERATION.
THE USE OF THE KNIFE UNNECESSARY.
R. R. L. , MEDICAL HERBALIST, 15, I

Edinburgh, 12th August, 1853.
This is either a libel upon somebody or other, ſº at under the

IMAGINARY PLAY-BILL.
WE observe that at one of the Metropolitan theatres an endeavour
been made to dramatise The Times. e admit some curiosity to
know in what way the leading journal has been adapted to the purposes
of the Stage. †: this hot weather it is of course impossible
for us to visit the theatre; but in the mean time we have drawn upon
our melodramatic reminiscences, and have sketched what we suppose
must be the playbill of The Times. We are, however, open to convic-
tion, should our anticipations have been inadequate.
ACT ONE.
SCENE 1–Printing House Square, by moonlight. A policeman on
duty. , Clank of the steampress heard amid the silence, and
distant plash of the river. Coronetted carriage driven hastily in.
Beautiful and fashionable lady, in opera costume, alights. Her
agitation. "He nºt be saved.” She dashes hastily into the
building. Policeman saunters up and examines arms on carriage,
and the next moment is recognised by the flunkey. “Ha! my
Lord.” “Silence, my faithful JEEMEs.” Resumes his walk.
Lights seen along a passage-mysterious lady is being conducted
to the EDITORIAL CHAMBER!
ScENE 2–The Strand. Meeting of two Reporters, one coming }
from the House of Commons, the other going down. “Likely
to sit º’’’ “Another hour—Irish row.” “Bless those Irish /*
“Amen.”. They part—erit. Reporter to the House. The other
lights a cigar, and three ruffians spring out upon him. They have
long Macintosh coats, but beneath the disguise is seen the
littering uniform of the Guards.
ORD $.. MACPAMBy’s Speech /* “I have.” “Hand it
over.” “With my life ". They seize him, but he dashes his
cigar into the face of the first, and wrestles with the second, but
would be over-mastered by the third, when the latter is dashed to
the earth. Two run away, the last is prisoner. “But, who is my
preserver ?”, “Sir, I am but a numble actor, but you were once
Ayind to me in a notice of my Clown in the Pantermine, and, believe
me, Sir, Ayindness is like the gentle jew from eaven, which #;
#. They drag the prisoner beneath a lamp... “THE RIGHT
oNour ABLE THE MARQUIs of HAUGHTYCASTLE | Ha, minion /*
s: lºt him go—my numble Friend. I know the game. A LADY's
ECRET.’
ScENE 3.-Same as first. Beautiful woman comes out in tears. “He
was most courteous, but firm as the monumental adamant.”. She
enters the carriage, and throws herself sobbing on the cushion.
Policeman springs in after her, and seating himself opposite,
throws his bull's-eye full on her face... “My husband "... “Aye
wrrrretched woman. Drive on, JEEMEs.” (In a voice of thunder.}
“HOME!” (With intense irony,) “Your home, Madam; yours,
once loved CORONETTINA.”
ACT TWO.
The House of Commons. Very full. Cries of “Order, order /*
Clamour increases, and no one can be heard. Fifty Members on
their legs, trying to speak. LoRD JoHN RUssell, springs upon
the table and gesticulates violently; but all that can be heard
from him, is “Obleege,” and “Constitution.” MR. DisrAELI
dashes his hand furiously upon the Green Box, which gives way,
and all his oranges roll out. Scramble and comic business.
LoRD NAMBY MACEAMBY rises, dressed in the extreme of fashion,
and also extremely tipsy. Terrific cries of “Spoke, spoke /". The
Chairman of Committees falls on his knees and jºfor silence,
but sinks beneath the volley of blue books, votes, and bills,
instantly hurled at him from all the Members. Suddenly the
SPEAKER rushes in, seizes the mace, and lays about him on every
sidc. . Members are knocked over one another. Tremendous
confusion | Fights!—and Curtain.
ACT TERIEE.
The Editor's Ante-Chamber. Several of the Ministers waiting to
see him; some with glittering stars, blue ribbons, &c. door
opens (centre), and an eminent Stockjobber is kicked into the
middle of the scene, and falls—a huge bag of sovereigns in each
hand. Bags burst, and the gold strews the stage. “I offered
£500,000 for leave to put in one article.”. Proud tribute to the
British Press., Porters sweep up the gold, and throw it out at
window, and, the Stockjobber, after it. Enter LoRD AstERIsk
.#ift the beautiful . “Ha / you here, my lords / But 'tis
well. She appealed to the “Times,” and I have brought her hither.”
Lady on her knees—back hair down... “I am innocent—indeed I
an innocent”, “I am not to be juped, Madam.” “I swear it.” “I
believe you not. Your adorers, in disguin, have been staining the
“. Kou bring the ºpepatot ºf
pure streets of our proud Metropolis with ruffianism. But in vain,
Madam.” “In tain / #. me /* “Now by all that is
sulphureous”-(he draws, the sword usually worn by the British
aristocrat)—“HOLD///?” Awful appearance of the EDITOR.
“Mistaken nobleman / She came but to save her BROTHER, LoRD
NAMBY MACPAMBY. ... He has spoken in the House to-night, and
knowing what a dreadful fool he is, she wished his speech suppressed,
that your brother-in-law's idiotcy might not be published all over the
world.” “Her brother / And those Guardsmen /* “Her cousins.”
“Ow/ ow/ow / Can you forgive me, CoRoNETTINA fº’” “Am I
not your wife, dearest ?” The EDIToR, moved, tears up LoRD
NAMBY MACPAMBY's speech. “One husk will not be missed amid
so much chaff.”
Affecting Denouement!
* OFF WITH HIs HEAD !”
LESSON FOR INNOCENT CABMEN.
SING a song of Sixpence,
“A pocket-full!” says I.
Four-and-twenty farthings?
That's all my eyel
But my eye was opened-
A summons he did seek;
And wasn't that a pretty case
To bring before the Beak?
The Beak was on his judgment-seat
A fining swell coves money;
And Punch was perch'd 'longside him,
Grinning precious funny.
FITzRoy had, in the Commons,
Been pickling us a rod;
And off went the prison van,
And took me to Quod'
The Road in 1853.
THE days of the Highwaymen are over: but that need not be la-
mented by the admirers of the robbers of the good old times. The
Highwaymen have been succeeded by the Railwaymen.

The Second Emperor promises to enrich the history of France with a

BREAKING-UP DAY AT WESTMINSTER.
HE Director-General
of the St. Stephen's
establishment, Mr.
Punch, proceeded,
in one cab, to West-
minster Hall, and,
desiring a chair to
be placed for him
upon the top of the
flight of steps at the
further end, com-
manded that the
entlemen of the
per and Lower
Schoolsshouldforth-
with attend him, for
the º: of hear:
ing his opinion of
their general and in-
dividual conduct,
reparatory to their
eing dismissed for
the holidays. It is
needless to say that
= his orders were in:
stantly complied
with, and that the
Westminster Boys
= at once assembled
before him. The
only exception was
in the case of
MASTER SIBThorp
who sturdily refused
to come, and for
whom a policeman
Was dispatched.
MASTER SIBTHORP
expended much abuse, and several quotations from the Eton Grammar,
upon the officer, but was ultimately brought in, and placed within
fººt reach of Mr. Punch's cane. *::: Punch then spoke as
Ollows :-
“My Boys,
. “You have had a long half, but it is oyer, and I am glad to dis;
miss you for your vacation. The word vacation, SIBTHoRP, is derived
from the Latin, and originally signifies emptiness, for an illustration of
which I will refer F. to the head of the gallant member for Lincoln,
or to the heads of those who can be such donkeys as to elect him.
# } I am, generally speaking, satisfied with your conduct during
e
A GENERAL STRIKE.
“Boys of THE UPPER SCHOOL,
“I rejoice to find a marked #. in the way you treat
your, themes. Your elocution is still open to amendment... I com:
mend your regular adherence to the beneficial habit of early rising. I
would caution you against quarrels amongst yourselves, arising from
the use of intemperate speech or inapt quotation (Masters DERBy and
OxroRD, blushed); and I would remind you that no social position
occupied by your papas and mammas #; any of you from the
duties which are imposed º others (Master WINCHEiseA began to
cry). ...But, as a whole, you have pleased me this year, and I will add
that the politeness with which you behave to ladies who may look in
upon the establishment reflects great credit upon you, not unincreased
by contrast (Sensation among the Lower School).
“ABERDEEN, you are leader of the school, and I could wish you to
display, more energy.. I applaud your love for a peaceful life, but
remember that there is one thing better than e, and that is,
honour. In the map of Russia, which you have drawn, you have not

MR, PUNCH PAYS A FINAL WISIT TO THE CAMP, AND TAKES OFF HIS HAT TO A
RATHER GLORIOUS OLD RAG,
FIGHTING FREWEN AND SOBER SHELLEY.
THERE appeared a chance a few days º that certain Members of
Parliament would, instead of shooting the grouse, have the more
exciting sport of shooting one another. SIR John SHELLEY very
properly refuses to be drawn into either a murder or a breach of the
eace; and quietly refers MR. FREwBN's furious correspondence to
Kºi. TYRRELL, PAINE, and LAYTON, who are, we presume, SIR
John's solicitors.
A “little quarrel” with a legal firm be less, agreeable to one
whom we fear, we must call Fighting FREWEN, than, a personal
rencontre with the Member for Westminster. A fight with a forensic
antagonist in Westminster Hall is more formidable than a little
harmless pistol-popping at Chalk Farm; and the powder of a
barrister's wig is more dangerous to be set in agitation than the com-
mon gunpowder of commerce.
Poor FREwBN is evidently much, nettled at finding that SIR John
SHELLEY won't fight, and in the desperate endeavour to stir up the
unwilling baronet, tries the old cab-driver's dodge of calling after him
“No gentleman!” We must say, we cannot congratulate, MR.
FREwen upon ha got the best of the matter in either spirit, taste,
or argument; for there is something more dignified in SIR John
SHELLEY's request to be “excused answering º: letters,”
than in MR. FREw EN's coarse wind up of “Call yourself agentleman!”
A NEW LACTOMETER.
. A GREAT philanthropist, and distinguished man of the world, has
inyented a new Lactometer for testing, the milk of human kindness.
We believe it is exceedingly simple, and consists principally of a plain
sheet of paper—not ike, in size, a page torn out of a banker's
cheque-book, but having a Government Stamp in the corner of it. It
is the size of this stamp that determines the quantity of milk of human
kindness. The larger the stamp the greater the supply of milk. The
test rarely fails, excepting with lawyers, guardians, step-fathers, and
others, º: hardy natures are well known not to be º
with the softening, lacteal properties of human kindness. The phi-
lanthropist intends taking out a patent for his ingenious invention.
A GANGWAY JOKE.
MR. HAYTER, the Whipper-in, was supposed by the Members of
Parliament to be very unfortunate with servants, for during the
past session, he was always going about trying to get a House made.

FUMIGATION OF THE THAMES.
ToBAcco fumes are unpleasan', to the majority of ladies. Never-
theless, we must protest against the prohibition of smoking abaft the
funnel on board Thames steamers. The other day we were ascending
the river in one of these vessels, seated in that quarter of it, when a
youth, who was indulging in a Pickwick to the windward of us, was
caused to transfer himself and his enjoyment forwards. No sooner had
he gone away with his smoke, than our nostrils were assailed by the
vilest of odours; a breath from the open mouth of a sewer on the
opposite bank. is was jº as we were passing the ARCHBIshop's
ace at Lambeth; and we could almost have imagined that
DR., SUMNER had been at work purifying the Church, and had
rendered its abuses palpable to the olfactory sense; in such great
indignation were our nostrils at the perfume emitted in the neigh.
bourhood of his Grace's §: We wished our young friend back
in with his “weed,” the fragrance of which we very much prefer to
that of metropolitan tributaries to the Thames: and until that stream
is somewhat dulcified, we should think that even ladies would approve
of universal fumigation on board its boats.

THE question of Peace has been carried in Europe, mem. con.

WHAT YOU MAY HEAR IN A BELL.
A CURIOUs old, philosopher of our acquaintance says:—“I can
always tell what kind of masters and servants there are in an establish-
ment by the way in which the bell is rung and answered. If the bell
is rung sharply, or snappishly, or at all loudly, I say to myself, You are
hard masters, impatient, intolerant, making no allowances, and always
expecting a thing to be done before it is even asked for, and my sus-
picions are generally verified by their ringing the bell a second time
more loudly than the first ; and if the servants take a long time in an-
swering the bell, I say to myself, You are bad servants, either lazy
or pampered, or spoilt by too much indulgence, and evidently taking
but little interest in your master's wishes. It is a sure sign that there
is not much peace or comfort to be met with in the house where the
master rings several times for everything he wants; and where the
servants require the bell to be rung twice before they think of an-
swering it.”
A Naval Blunderbuss.
WE are sorry to motice an anachronism in a ſº review. We

NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER Two—The first time, a
woman marries it is generally to please another; but the
second time it is invariably to please herself.
THE INQUISITION AT MALTA.
HERE is a pretty dish that was to have been set before the QUEEN:-
“Whosoever, during the performance of the sacred functions or ceremonies of the
Church of the country, the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, the maintenance and
º of which, in its present position, are secured by law, and guaranteed by the
ritish Crown, shall disturb the same with violence or with intent to profane, whether
within or without places appointed for public worship, shall be punished with imprison.
ment, from seven months to two years.”
According to MR. I., BUTT this passage is contained in the 50th
Clause of the amended Maltese Criminal Code which has been coolly
sent to this country for the sanction of HER MAJESTY. -
No doubt a person who should wantonly interrupt a congregation of
Mormonites, or even of dancing Dervishes, engaged in their devotions,
would deserve to be punished; of course, therefore, there is no lom-
plaining of a law which avenges interference with Roman Catholic rites
and ceremonies—those rites and ceremonies not going quite so far as
the rite of cremation and the ceremony of an auto-da-fé.
It is also indubitable that the adherents of the Römish Church have
A perfect right to call their persuasion Catholic and *::::::: or any-
thing else they please, and hold that assertion against all comers, by all
means: except, we will say, by means of fire and sword.
But to propose the recognition of the Roman Catholic Church, as
Aſ ºf to the QUEEN or ENGLAND, is—without reference to
polemics—richly absurd.: since HER MAJEsty holds her royal seat on
the very condition of constantly protesting—right or wrong—that the
Roman Catholic Church is no such thing.
If Mr. Punch were in Malta, writing under this same amended
criminal code, he would have to take care, how he pointed out any
itoman Catholic absurdity. He is informed by MR. New DRGATE,
“That the 54th Clause declared it to be punishable to “revile or otherwise insult or
ridicule any article of the Roman Catholic Church.'"
Now there are other varieties of ridicule than burlesque, caricature,
horse-laughter, and ing faces..., There , is the ridicule of the
reductio ad absurdun. It is possible, to place a proposition, in a
ludicrous light by showing that if it is true, it is a truth which is
cont to another truth. In Malta, therefore, subject to the above
clause, it would be dangerous to assert the impenetrability of matter,
or any other fact in the nature of things inconsistent with any dogma
of the papal system; and if Mr. Punch were not to mind what he was
about, º might get himself into trouble in like manner with that other
buffoon, GALILEo.
However, Mr. KINNAIRD has procured the re-consideration of these
| that §
mal papisticalities: and Ministers will think twice before they advise
º: AJESTY to stultify herself and sanction a Maltese Inquisition.
A HINT TO BELGRAVIA, TYBURNIA, CADOGANIA, &c. &c.

PEDESTRIANISM VERY EXTRAORDINARY.
HE Wolverhampton Chronicle contains
the following paragraph, highly im-
portant to ladies:-
“The Woman's Walk—MRs. DuNN's pedes-
trian feat—walking 1,000 miles in 1,000 hours
—at Noah's Ark, Hartshill, continues to attract
much attention, greatnumbers of people visiting
her. She has accomplished about four-sixths
of the task, and is very confident of success."
It has been said with no less truth
than vulgarity, that the walking of
womankind is all WALKER. Too
generally, indeed, it resembles a mode
of progression adopted by the insect
tribes, except in being performed with
two legs instead of several, or without
any at all. All praise to the exception
to this rule presented by MRs. DuNN.
We have not the pleasure of being
acquainted with either that lady or
MR. DuNN, but sure we are that she
makes her husband a happy man if the
health of his wife can make a man
happy; as of course it can or should:
whereas her illness at least makes him
very much the reverse. By exercise
in the open air is acquired that sound-
mess of condition, accompanied by
mental serenity and beauty of com-
lexion which can never result from
dancing in an atmosphere of carbonic acidº only purpose for which many,
many ſadies use their legs. What MR. DuNN's partner costs him for shoes, we
are sure he does not ſº and he would be a fool if he did, for it is much
cheaper that she should walk him out a little leather than that she should stand
him in a large quantity of medicine: to say nothing of the cabs and omnibuses
which are frequently required to travel a hundred yards or so by other wives.
BRITISH OBSEQUIES IN SPAIN
If you wish to save your Succession Duty, reform your Undertaker's Bills.
There is nothing to prevent you but the censure of the lowest vulgar-the mob
that does not think for itself: a mob composed of quite as many well dressed
persons as ragamuffins. Unfortunately, however, this populace may be able to
injure as well as hoot you; and that power it will exercise if you do not conform
to i. idiotisms; one of which is, the addition of upholstery to ashes, and drapery
to dust.
It would therefore be a great boon to you—being a wise man, and likewise an
executor or a legatee charged with an interment—if your expenditure were subject
to be º the subjoined ordinance:-
“In conveying dead bodies to the burial-ground every kind of pomp and publicity shall be
avoided.”
They manage these matters better in Spain, you will say: for this is one of the
articles of a Royal decree that has been issued at Madrid.
But it is also ordained in the same decree, that
“No church, chapel, nor any other sign of a temple or of public or private worship will be allowed
to be built in the aforesaid cemetery.”
Now, the aforesaid cemetery is the Protestant cemetery. And it is further
declared that
“All acts which can give any indication of the performance of any divine service whatever are
prohibited.”
The above regulations will be found in a Parliamentary paper recently published,
containing official correspondence between GENERALLERsuspi and loºd Howpºx,
relative to the Protestant Cemetery, aforesaid at Madrid. The noble Lord's repl
to the gallant officer will be found highly satisfactory, as conveying to the sº
Government the assurance of that distinguished contempt for it, which is due to a
set of imbecile and miserable bigots—utensils of their priesthood.
One would really think that the clergy of Spain and almost all other Roman
Catholic countries were doing their very utmost to earn the crown of martyrdom-
not, however, for themselves, but for their ecclesiastical brethren, together with
all the lay partisans of Popery in Protestant countries. They appear to be
trying as hard as they can to prove that the predominance of their religion is
inconsistent with civil freedom. The struggles, then, so perseveringly made, both
in and out of Parliament, to extend and establish an influence which, wherever it
prevails, is seen to issue in tyranny the most hateful; what can they be con-
sidered but endeavours to spin cobwebs about our liberties? And have we not

Jon N BRIGHT is a pestilent fellow,
Always ready for making a fight,
But of all his low bluster and bellow,

We do give away now and then,
But to go and accuse us of selling 'em 1–
When we're all of us “hon'rable men!”
SIR. JAMEs. Hogg from his place in the IIouse
Repelled MR. BRight's imputation;
And showed all his usual nous
In insisting on investigation.
Such inquiry we’ve made as we can, Sir,
And we’re ready to make it again,
To ask freely—when parties won't answer—
Proves clearly we’re “hon'rable men.”
In the first place our statutes declare
The sale of appointments illegal,
So of course to such sales none would dare
Directors to try and inveigle,
'Twas done once—but though that was by charity—
The law on the case threw its ken,
And the row that was made proved the rarity
Of such practice 'mong “hon'rable men.”
City men—we've our City connections—
(In this there is no impropriety)
We've the social and private affections
Which belong to our grade in society.
If Ilay a man 'neath obligation,
Of course he'll oblige me again;
But we never take remuneration—
For we’re all of us “hon'rable men.”

If young NoDD1Es have writerships handed 'em,
And young Bloggs Treasury clerkships, what then :
Is º less, though John BRight may have branded
ilm,
One of twenty-four “hon'rable men?”
As we’re quite the commercial élite,
In the very first circles while moving,
If the dignified clergy we meet,
The occasion we’re right in improving.
What delight for the son of a bishop
To provide, by a stroke of the pen
In return—if a living he fish up
Why we’re both of us “hon'rable men.”
Even Cabinet Ministers often
Are proud to admit us as friends,
In those social enjoyments which soften
Official hauteur, till it bends:
What pleasure to give one's cadetshi
To a hard-worked First Lo º then,
One's sons, now on half-pay, should get ships,
Does that prove us less “hon'rable men?”
As with other men's daughters and wives,
So with ours it is often a passion
(As the Bank or the Brewery thrives),
To shine in the regions of fashion;
For a chaperon countess's matronage,
Or a duchess's favouring ken,
A slice of one's Indian patronage,
Is no price among “hon'rable men.”
Then let's hope that the scandal will never
Again with belief be received,
That for Indian tº's We ever
Dream of such t Ing, as “Value received.”
“Nought for nothing,” of old was the motto,
And appointments were trafficked in then,

HE philosophic tra-

manners of “our

bours.” At the

Station he finds a
crowd of excited
E. evidently
nt on the same
object. Everyman
as a passport in
his breast-pocket,
and is encum-
bered with much
unnecessary lug-
gage, including
the plate-chest, so
indispensable to

tleman's toilet.
A foretaste of

given by groups
of Frenchmen º
beards and mous-
tachios, wrapped
in furred gar-
ments of strange
fashion, and over-
come by nervousness at the varied dangers which they are about
to encounter. Your correspondent, with proper indifference, reads
Punch and the evening papers all the way to Dover. His companions
are two anxious Gauls, a boy and his tutor, and a party of exceedingly
ay appearance and manners, who has no uniform rule for the intro-
duction or suppression of his h’s. He is perhaps a traveller in the
button or hook-and-eye line.
At Dover the tourist is turned out into the dark with his com-
panions, and finds himself in the power of a band of bravoes, who
share the luggage between them, thrust us, the helpless owners, into
narrow and filthy dungeons on wheels, and then, reckless of prayers
and menaces, hold a council upon our fate. We are at length #.
off into deeper gloom, and the plash of the ocean awakens indefinable
apprehensions in the breasts of all. But we wrong the band—they
are honest as things go, and will take, ransom. A shilling, under
pretence of an omnibus ride of a hundred yards, satisfies one ruflian;
a second shilling stays the wrath of another, who in return mildly
slides your portmanteau down a board into the steamer. This vessel
is fuming in great excitement at everybody’s confounded stupidity and
slowness. “What on earth are you waiting for P’’ it seems to say.
“How can you possibly expect me to take the letters in time? It’s
all very Wei for you, you know, but I’m a public character, and have
got a reputation to keep up. Don't stand loitering there about those
things. Pitch 'em in anyhow. Hang the luggage. What’s luggage
to letters? You have no idea how important the mail-service is. I
know I’m very passionate, and if you don’t come at once I shall
scream.”
Ah! the last carpet-bag is in ; the bell rings, the bad lan e
partially ceases, the mooring ropes are cast off, and the fussy, old
animal is allowed to have her own way. The philosophic tourist finds
his companions of the train. The tutor is curled up under the table
in the cabin, which is, full of sleepers, lying about in every direction
like great flies who have overeifen'themselves. The distinguished
foreigners have already become pale even at the tranquil heavin
the harbour tide. #. hook-and-eye man and the boy are *:::
infamous cheroots, drinking neat cognac, and making pointless jokes
in a loud voice to the steward. We are outside the pier. Your
correspondent has no emotions. He sees the cliffs of Albion diminish
without a sigh—a regret. He does not feel the poetry of the situation.
He omits to quote Childe Harold to a gentleman's servant who kindly
helps him on with a third great-coat. He is perhaps brutal; yet he is
not without some remains of human sentiment. The greatest pleasure
man can enjoy is to contemplate the misfortunes of others. Accordingly,
he visits the sick. The cabin has become a hospital—a Pandemonium.
To stay there is impossible, he returns to the deck. Alas! the furry
exiles are paying a bitter tribute to the ocean. The happier ancients
could propitiate NEPTUNE with a horse. Now-a-days he has a fancy
for human sacrifices, and will only be appeased by a portion of our-
selves. Hooks-AND-EYEs has lost his disposition to joke, regrets the
of |l
brandy, curses the cheroot, and, sits down in gloomy, silence. The
oungster is jollier than ever, and chaffs his discomfited friend, whom
}. pronounces in private an awful snob. - -
Meanwhile the swift steamship cuts through the hissing waves. A
south wind springs up, and we enjoy a pleasant, variety of motion.
To the original regular dip and rise which tried so many, is now
added a jerking roll, occasionally amounting to a lurch. “Ah ciel /*

said we should have a good passage,” complain half a dozen other
wretched beings, who make up a party to º the same position.
The philosopher and his young friend pace the dºck as well as they
can, and hold sweet conversation. The artless lad details his ancient
lineage, his past at Eton, his future at º, and the Continental
tour which, iſſustrated by the mild wisdom of JENKINs, M.A., is to
fill up the interval between the two. These pleasant words make short
the voyage. “Mark, my youthful acquaintance,” says the philosopher,
“mark, the abject misery of these men. There are Britons among
them, but the first, the feeblest of them all are French. Rejoice,

And now, perhaps, yo! will do me the favour of whistling Rule

Tha
Britannia.
The lights of Calais become rapidly visible, the seas abate, the
groaning invalids recover their legs, the poor sick ladies come up from
the cabin; we glide into smooth water listening to strange cries from
the pier, and finally grate along the quay. We are welcomed to the
strand of France by douaniers in green with round caps, and policemen
in blue with cocked hats and yellow shoulder-belts. We must try to
admire and love these men, for as long as we remain, they are fated to
be our constant companions. The dilapidated troop of travellers is
marched into a sort of condemned cell, whence a detachment disappears
from time to time to undergo the examination of their passports and
uggage. Here comes the first need of the French tongue. The
miserable foreigners recover something of their importance, and the
Britons, proud of their exemption from the troubles of the sea, begin
to find that they are mortal. Hooks-AND-EYEs, emboldened by excessive
draughts of brandy, which make him blink and walk unsteadily,
becomes a public character by the wonderful volubility with which he
talks an idiom of his own, perfectly unintelligible to the officials.
He fancies, it would seem, that he is speaking some Continental
language. An hour—two hours—are thus cheerfully spent, and we
ultimately settle into a train which ultimately starts. Sleep is
rendered impossible by a tin box full of hot water laid at the bottom
of the carriage, which, though it certainly warms your feet, brings
3. knees up to your chin, and at last amounts to an instrument of

That Master of Arts, who, under happier circumstances, might have
here given a quotation from Wirgil’s, Georgies, was meekly prostrate

open cars, and º and jabbering without end. Houses become
more frequent—tall, slim, ...i. white structures, with Venetian
blinds outside each window. More careful cultivation marks the
proximity of a great, market. Finally, we pass deep ditches, low
massive walls, not visible till you are close to them when you see how
enormous they are, a ragged suburb, and we are in Paris. A fresh
searching ºf luggage, a light one this time, for butter, eggs, and
cabbages, I believe, sets us free—that is, as free as anyone can be
out of dear Old England.
The philosophic traveller here makes one reflection. What assurance
a man must have to bore the British public with the description of a
journey that every one has made, and knows as well as he does the

ALARMING
RAILWAY ACCIDENT.
Naccident, the consequences
of which have proved more
serious than was at first an-
ticipated, has occurred on
the Lancashire and York-
shire Railway, the rails and
sleepers of which had, we
understand, been, for some
time previously, in an inse-
cure condition. The result
has been damages to the

lesson to them, by teaching
them to make better arrange.
ments for the safety of the
public. Many of the vic-
tims, we believe, have wives
and families, to , whom,
- - however, it is not appre-
hended that their loss will prove unusually distressing.
FURTHER PARTICULARs.
Since the accident, we are informed by our special contemporary,
the Morning Post, that the authorities of the Railway in question
“Have issued the following ticket, which passengers on their dangerous line are
required to sign, and which we here give word for word as it is printed and issued by
these liberal directors:–
“'This ticket is issued by the Company and accepted by the holder, upon the
express understanding and agreement that the Company are not to be in any way held
responsible to the holder, or his representatives, for the consequences of any accident,
however caused, which may happen to the holder, while travelling in any of the
Company's vehicles, or being at any of the Company's Stations. It must be exhibited
to the Company's omicers whenever required, and any person using it other than the
º º herein will be liable to the same penalties as a passsenger who does not
pay his fare.’”
We have no reason for supposing that the above agreement is a hoax
which has been palmed off upon our contemporary, or that it is a joke
at the expense of those unfortunate people who have been already put
to so much. On our mind there is no doubt of its authenticity. We
are sorry to say we do not think it calculated to answer its purpose;
which is to insure theº of the Company against the con:
sequences of those awful accidents which are inevitable on an unsafe
line. In the first place, we are of opinion that it would not hold good
in law. But even if it were legal, it would only tend to obviate the
pecuniary consequences of accidents, by preventing the accidents from
occurring; and that simply by deterring the public from running the
risk of them. To find a *... Company demanding to insure their
property against his loss of life or limb, as a condition to taking him as
a passenger, is rather calculated to reduce a man to a sense of the
dreadful situation in which he must place himself by venturing on their
line. If they persist in issuing this precautionary ticket, t ey might
as well, for consistency's sake, adorn, their stations with death's heads
and tombstone cherubim, and cover their platforms with black cloth.

“Oh // Look’ee here, Sir, here's a warm long enough to last you
a fortnight.”
OUR HONEY MOON.
—4–
WEDNESDAY-MAY 29, 18–.
“Now, my dear FRED–if I could only feel certain you were quite
ashamed of yourself, you don't know how comfortable I should be *
Call ºf. Christian, and going out murdering people!” I couldn't
help saying as much : no, quite the reverse.
“But nobody's hurt,” said FRED, laughing. “Besides, now we’re
the best friends in the world.”
“Well, men are creatures, to be sure! To make friendship over
bullets and gunpowder. And supposing you’d been killed? Now,
just to satisfy me, just for a moment suppose that?”
Whereupon, in his odd way, he stared in my face; and said he
thought the calamity would have mightily become me.
“And to have been made a widow for another person—and that
person, one's own servant. But I have given Josephi NE warming”—
“Nonsense !” said FREDERick, and I did stare. “Nonsense, my
darling,”, he repeated in his tender way; but I was not to be
persuaded.
“Why, the creature was bold esough befºre. Put with the thought
in her head that her master had been fighting a duel, and all about her,
she’d be as conceited, the house wouldn't hold her. She goes: now,
it’s no use talking, of that I’m determined.”
“And so because a foolish young man—not but what he’s a very
good fellow—will write letters to a silly girl”—
“Oh, never tell me ! . He’d never have sent letters and nosegays to
such a person, if she hadn't encouraged him.”
“Ha! that’s how you women help one another! The man begins
the injury, and the sister-woman finishes it. No, Lotty; you’ll do
nothing of the sort. You'll not part with Josephin E; and, more than
that, you’ll see young BLiss to-day. Who’d have thought to fight the
brother of ºil
“The fisherwoman P. Well, it’s very odd; I must say it’s odd:
and if I do consent to see him, I know I shall only be laughed at.”
“Do what’s right, LOTTY; and then you may laugh with the
laughers.”
Now there was such good sense in this, that what could I say?
Why, I didn't know; so list put my arm about his neck.
“Yes, my love, and you’ll not crush poor TRUEPENNY"—
“Now, don't ask me that, FRED; that is really too much.”
“They’ll both be here to-day; and, come, I’ll strike a bargain with
you, Lotty P”
“A bargain?” said I.” Why, what's the use, FREp, when you always

... If you’ll receive young Bliss”—
“But is it really true that Miss, BLIss—the young lady with the
artificial flies—is going to be married? Really true?”
“I’ve told you, I hear next week. That fine young fellow we saw
at the church, he’s the man. When their honeymoon is over, I intend
to ask them, and young BLiss, too, to The }}}.}}
“Well?” said I, a little relenſing. “And now your bargain?”
“You’ll see young Bliss and TRUEPENNY-they’ll be here to lunch
—and we’ll start for home, by the first stage to-day, directly afterwards.
Is it a bargain?”
“It’s two days earlier than we’re looked for,” said I.
“Very well, ſet us stop out the time here,” cried FREp.
“Not another hour. No; now I shall never be fully happy till I'm
at home. I do verily believe, I shall go upon my knees and kiss the
door-step. So Joseph INE has but to bestir herself-I only hope she’ll
prove herself worthy of the confidence we place in her; but it's
a risk, FRED; depend on it, 'tis a risk.”
With this 1 ran away to my room, and made Joseph INE comfortable,
telling her that I thought her a most imprudent, if not a very culpable
young woman, to have nosegays and letters sent to her, and so to destroy
the peace of families—for it was no use to tell me that she couldn't help
the gentleman sending them, that I couldn't believe;—but nevertheless
if, as I believed, she was truly sorry for her conduct, I wouldn't have
the heart to throw her upon the wide, wide world; but would much
rather prefer to take her home with us, and—if she continued to behave
herself—to make her happy as the day was long. I said all this;
but I was sorry, really hurt to observe, that the young woman listened
to a good deal. I said, like any stone. But then for gratitude, who's
to expect it?
We soon had everything packed, and I returned to FRED. Was
ever anything so provoking * Instead of MR. Bliss and that TRUE-
PENNY, came two letters of apology. MR. Bliss had received a
sudden call upon his attention that he must obey, but hoped to be
allowed to see FRED and “his charming partner’’-(and he'd thought
nothing of making her a disconsolate widow !)—some day at The
Flitch. As for MR. TRUEPENNY, he declared to FRED that “he had
not the courage to meet his wife: ” which I considered a very proper
compliment to my spirit. I scalººly thought the man had as much
remorse and proper feeling in him. And then he added—“P.S.. I
write this upon my knees, sending my contrition to your estimable
partner; with nºrmºst prayer that, at some distant day, I imay be
permitted to approach her at her own fires.de. Dinner is tº my
ambition as above my deserts: bot, I trust, that after due time and

“I really don’t see anything to laugh at,” said I to FRED, who was
mightily amused as he read the letter. And to say the truth I was a

However, we lunched alone; paid the bill; and—shall I ever forget

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GREAT CATCHES.
HETHER everybody has
his price or not; there are
some quite capable of selling
themselves, even by auc-
tion; as, for one, instance,
we should think; the author
of the subjoined advertise-
ment:—
S LEDGER CLER K,
Manager, and Correspondent.
—A gentleman, of close-sticking
business habits, who does nothing
by halves, whose references as to
character, &c., are first-rate, and
whose devotion to his employers'
interests ever has been unbounded,
is just now open, to a RE-EN-
GAGEMENT. The advertiser is
of ripe, vigorous, middle-age, and
; so undeviatingly systematic, as by
the restless force of example, to
be qualified to establish, in all
around him, habits of perseve-
rance, self denial, and fagging, in-
dustry, such as could not fail to
tell wonderfully, as those habits
became more and more fully deve-
loped, on any set of people so orga-
nised. Clever men of business,
who, one and all, admire clever-
ness in others, and especially when
it makes to them its own peculiar
bow of the most profound obei-
sance, are most resp. ctfully re-
quested to address their replies to
Alph A Delta, &c, &c.
The gentleman so indus-
triously adhesive certainly
does not cry himself up by
halves; and the glowing
language in which he des:
cribes his age as “ripe and
vigorous,” might well be
come some Yankee GeoRGE
RoBINs appraising an
UNCLE Toyſ. We can vi.
vidly imagine him putting
himself up, ringing the
changes on his ripeness and
vigour, first-rate references,
undeviatingly ... systematic
ways, close-sticking busi;
mess habits, and unbounded
devotion to his employers' interests: and ultimately, with his “own
eculiar bow of the most profound obeisance,” respectfully knocking
himself down to the best bidder. We should like to buy him at Qur
terms in this manner, if we could afterwards dispose of him at his
own. But our friend blows his trumpet with rather too many flou;
rishes; makes overmuch use of the º: hyperbole, to commend
himself for employment in those figures that Ledger Clerks are more
particularly concerned with.
In the same Times that contained the foregoing announcement,
appears also the following:—
No SALARY REQUIRED.—A young Gentleman (20 years of age),
author of several works, wishes for a HOME. He is a beautiful reader and writer;
can write poetry, tales, essays, and anything literary. He is possessed of pleasing
manners, kind disposition, and would do all in his power to make himself useful, and
contribute to the happiness of those with whom he may become associated. One of his
works sent for six stamps. Address REGINALD WILLIERs, &c., &c."
This is a performance on a similar instrument; but it is the clarionet
to the cornet-à-pistons. Only 20; a “beautiful” reader and writer;
can write poetry, tales, essays, and “anything literary;”, and is
already the “author of several works.” Why, this is a second
“CHATTERTON the marvellous Boy,"
and we should say he had better take care that he does not so far
resemble
“The sleepless Soul that perished in his pride,”
as to go off, some day, in a fit of vanity and self-conceit. -
... We are almost inclined to send him six stamps for one of his works,
in order that we may ascertain if it is worth a single rap.
Roebuck Himself Again.
The Sheffield Independent announces that MR. Roebuck's health is
so much improved that he has accepted an invitation to the Cutlers'
feast. We are happy to hear it, and hope MR. Roebuck will do the
Cutlers the credit of playing a good knife and fork.

THE Coinage Committee, which sat in the City,
At last have completed their labour,
And derive from the action intense satisfaction;

But as it may be thought that we mean our “report.”
For the special behoof of “the City,”
Half a page of the Times we'll condense into rhymes
To the air of a Popular ditty.

And take to the decimals rather!
As in loyalty bound, we shall stick to the pound—
'Twould be treason the “sovereign" to banish;
But all the half-crowns, “bobs,” “joeys,” and “browns,”
Into Royal Mint-sauce must evanish.
But we'll leave you the Florin, which cannot be foreign,
As every one lots of them handles

So we hope by next session, you’ll be in possession
Of some sensible decimal money;
And pay all little bills in cents, florins, and mils,
Never mind if, at first, it seem funny.

Perchance for “nicknames" may be roarin’;
Recollect in a “mill” you’ve of pounding your fill,
And frequently plºuty of floorin'.
Now, Public! tho' slow—that you're grateful to show

The least you can do, is to just buckle to,
And give the Committee—a dinner!
Then, though it's uphilly, &c.
"I || |}|RITISH CONSUILATE AT BOULOGNE.
(From our Travelling Contributor.)
THE British Consulate at Boulogne still “hangs out ’’ over the
“ tinnery, leadery, and zincery,” at the end of the port, as we have
ascertained by a recent visit. The i." floor is occupied by a sauce-
}. shop, while British diplomacy has taken the floor above, and the
rontage of the premises displays a rivalry of attraction between the
“British &ºil. Office for Passports” and the “Bazar des Quatre’
something or other, which the tinman adopts as the name of his
domicile. -
We recognise no change in the arrangements since we noticed the
establishment two years ago, except that the individual who represents
British diplomacy has got a new cap, is rather more civil spoken than
he was, and the boy who runs to call him when he is in another room
is grown bigger than he used to be. This is all natural enough, and
so far unobjectionable, though we are not quite so well satisfied with a
rope that has been attached to one side of the staircase by way of
bannisters. On the day of our visit there was a consular torchon, or
diplomatic dishclout hanging to dry on the landing, which we thought
savoured of anything but dignity. The rope was well enough as far as
it went, and the Consul has ſº the public just rope enough to hang
itself, or rather to pull itself up by, in ascending the staircase. We
presume that all this homeliness is as much as the passport fees will
afford, and we can only regret, for the credit of British diplomacy,
that it is as much dignity as can be sustained upon the four-and-two-
pences that pour in on the establishment at Boulogne.

A HAIR of the dog that bit you is recommended as a cure for the
consequences of drunkenness; but when intoxication results in beating
women, the dog does not afford so proper a remedy as the cat.

LEADING ARTICLE FOR OLD LADIES.
(On the proposed New Coinage.)
WE are, and always were, averse to change. We do not mean to
say that we have, or ever had, any objection to those coppers which
long custom has hallowed, and which have been consecrated to charity.
But when innovation would tamper with the coin of the realm, we, in
common with all HER MAJESTY's loyal subjects, are necessitated to
rally round the Sover EIGN, not only as such, but as represented by
monetary subordinates. And when we observe that one of the prin-
cipal features in the contemplated revolution is the abolition of the Half-
Crown, we cannot but consider the CRow N, and with the CRown the
Throne, and of course the Cºuncil to be placed in jeopardy. In
short, we must record our emphatic protest against the proposed
1)ecimal Currency. It was under the old arrangement of pounds,
shillings, pence, and farthings, that the country attained to its present
pitch of glory and º: That the Decimal system has been
adopted by foreigners is the very reason why we ... if persist in our
own. , What is it that makes them so eager to take our money, if not
its acknowledged superiority to theirs?
. The democratic, indeed the levelling character of the decimal agita-
tion is obvious from one remarkable fact, which, may, perhaps, how.
ever, be new to our readers. It is notorious that the lower classes are
addicted to the use of slang or flash language, especially in connection
with pugilism. , Now we have already had introduced a coin of foreign
denomination, but domestic orthography. We allude to the piece of
money termed a florin a word which, as spelt by the populace—as many
of them as can speii at all-signifies the act of knocking or bein
knocked down. It is proposed that one of the new-fangled coins sha
bear the yet more yulgar appellation of a mil; which in the same voca-
bulary signifies a fistic encounter.
From a Parliamentar Commission subservient to a Downing Street
gang, thus evidently deriving the nomenclature of their projected
coinage on the one hand from Continental Jews, Papists, and Infidels;
and on the other from the BRUMMAGEM Chicken and the Tiptos
Official. “CHRISTIAN NoM?”
THE PLOUGHBOY'S DOOM I
THE stubble-headed Ploughboy
No more a-field shall stride,
Smock-frocked, with whip on shoulder,
The steer or steed to guide;
At dawn, no more shall whistle
With early lark and thrush;
No longer stalk the fallows
The clods no longer crush.
In vacant rumination,
No more shall sit on gate; ,
His shanks beneath him dangling
By hob-mailed highlows’ weight.
That form of grace no longer
The hedgerows shall adorn,
His dab of bacon slicing
Upon his palm of horn.
The Boy—smock, boots, and bacon,
And whip, must yield to Steam;
His whistle must be silent,
Whilst engines hiss and scream;
For MEchi has in action
A new machine c'en now,
And says his apparatus
Will supersede the Plough.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PETERLOO BROWN'S EXAMINATION OF THE
OXFORD STATUTES.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“I venture but once again to trouble }. with a few remarks;
and, as I am looking forward to my lad matriculating this next October,
I shall be glad of your speedy advice as to whether I ought to send him
to a place where he will have to swear to observe Statutes like those I
have spoken of, and those I am now about to mention.
“The next Statute after ‘the herb Nicotiana, is about the closing
of the College gates at
9 o'clock, and says,
that if circumstances
should call for it (sires
ita postulet), the Heads
of the Houses shall
chamber (perlustratis
singulorum, cubiculis),
to see if their tenants
are there. This is a
delightful rule; and, if
circumstances do not
call for the Heads to
make their rounds, it
only shows that the
Statute is obeyed with-
out such supervision.
Early to bed, you know,
A Mr. Punch, not only
reads to salubriousness
of body and purse, but
conduces to wis-
dom of intellect; and,
doubtless, much of the
success of the ‘Oxford
discipline' that we
hear so much about may be traced to this..." early-closing movement.”
Nobody MUST be out of his chamber. Arten nine
o'clock IN THE Evexixo.
I am glad to find that my son PETERLoo will not have to carry out the f
popular idea of a student, by burning ‘the midnight oil’—which you
.# I, as men of the world, know is a mere figure of speech, and only
leads to biliousness of body and cutting of morning chapels—but that
he will have to be in bed by 9 o'clock, and, possibly, may be tucked u
by the Head of the College himself, attended, of course, by bedels an
º H. pokers,’ and all the paraphernalia of Collegiate grandeur. And,
Mr. Punch, what an instructive subject ‘Alma Mater putting her
children to bed” would be for MR. Tº NNIEL to turn into a cartoon for
the new Houses of Parliament; where, in spite of the exertions of
MRs.-I mean MR.—BROTHERTON, the Members will waste the gas
and their health in ºf late hours—a thing they were plainly never
allowed to do as long as they were at Oxford! - -
“The next Statute not only forbids the students to indulge in all games
that might be hurtful to them-
selves (abstineant ab omni lusus
genere, in quo de pecunid concer-
tatur), but also requires them to
abstain from every kind of game
or sport which might cause any
danger, injury, or inconvenience
to others; as, for example, from
the hunting of wild beasts with
dogs of all kinds, with ferrets,
nets, or snares (item quod al-
stincant ab omni genere lusus rel
erercifu, er quo allis periculum,
injuria, cel incommodum creatur:
veluti a renatione ferarum cum S
canibus cujuscunque generis, vi-S
terris, retibus, aut plagis). Oh
Mr. Punch, does Oxford still
*. the same position it held
in dark centuries ages ago, that
it is forced to make its matricula-
ting candidates swear to abstain
from the sports of a savage life,
which may be all * well for a
GoRDON CUMMING, but do not
accord with the peaceful pursuits
of a cloistered student? And what, I would ask, are the wild beasts
for which Oxford is famous Are they of the same genus as those
which §§ young neighbour BELLINGHAM GREY speaks of He tells
me that Oxford is infested with the varied species ...} the Ornithorhyncus
—the Beast with a Bill—which usually . in dens to which they
endeavour, by many allurements, to entice their victims; and that, so
then go round to each |&#
cunning are they, that they will even steal within the College walls and
attack a Student in his own |...". room, and cannot be got away
before they have made him bleed freely. He says, that there is no
way of capturing these beasts, and that they can only be kept off by
~~~~ egrees; º that *:::
u ę..., \ once you have loun
Jh {{ſ. º) means to settle them,
dºux// - - - -
- º their Bill immediately
--~~
drops off; and that they
are not seen again until
their bill has been curiously
renewed. I wonder that
the manager of the Zoo-
logical. Gardens don't get
hold of specimens of this
very curious beast, the
ord Ornithorhyncus;
more especially as they
seem to be so common.
But I suppose that their
difficulty of capture at
resent stands in the way.
ut, who knows, but what
we shall see them next
season among the ‘lions’ of the Gardens, and eclipsing in interest even
the vivarium and the hippopotamus? -
“But to return to the Statute. Though I think I smell a badger,
i. the word “ferrets” seems to point, at rats. But if, in their
humanity, the authorities discour rat-hunting—which, of course,
must be an inconvenience’ to the rat, even if it cause him no
‘danger or injury’—why do they shut their eyes to the legions of
terriers, and other rat-killing dogs, that are openly possessed by the
members of the University ? I am at a loss to know for what species
of wild beasts the 'snares and nets’ are intended, unless the youn
men poach for rabbits and hares. But as for fox-hunting, I shall
know now how far I may believe young. BELLINGHAM GREY when
he says that he, and more than a score of ‘pinks’ may be seen in a
morning, setting off from the Canterbury Gate of Christ Church! And
as for the loo, and whist, and Yan John’ that he speaks of, not to
mention écarté, and the money that changes hands in one evening, why
. º afraid that the young gentleman has been imposing upon my
credulity.
“The Statute goes on to forbid the boys—I beg pardon, the ‘men''
—from the use of hawks for fowling,
and from the carrying of cross-bows
and , ‘Bombardarum’ (necnon ab
omni apparatu et gestatione Bom-

Now, I am aware that the old noble
Sport of hawking is being revived,
because I take in The Field (for,
of course, I look upon myself as a
‘ country gentleman,’ and do every-
º that country gentlemen ought
to do), and in %. Field I some-
times read about it; and I suppose :
the Oxford gentlemen are assisting
in the revival. But, in the name
of wonder, Mr. Punch, what can be
meant by ‘Bombardarum?’ Has
it anything to do with your Austrian
friend ‘BoMBA?? Or does it mean
that the young men must not carry
about mortars for the discharge of
bombs, or battering-rams, or some
‘bombarding’ implement “of that
ilk?” But no. “ }. and Gowm’
disturbances can never need suc
*: as these. I
suppose must write to your
facetious contemporary Notes and

no Latin Dictionaly that I have
access to is able to inform me. Really, Mr. Punch, my Lord CHAN-
CELLOR, DERby ought to publish either a translation of the Statutes
of his University or a dictionary of these ‘Oxford mixture’ phrases
‘canino Anglico Latine reddita:” for how can young men be ex ected
to obey Statutes which are made up of words of º the
meaning can only be conjectured 2 And if, Mr. Punch, you take
up the cudgels for the Oxford Statutes, and tell me that they
are thus purposely framed, and after the fashion of the Statutes of
the country, I beg to observe that the seat of learning ought to
be stuffed with other stuff than that which fills the woolsack, and

Lord of the Upper House, to whom we might say, in the words of
CoLERIDGE:-
“‘You can utter, with a solemn gesture,
Oracular sentences of deep no-meaning,
Wear a quaint garment, make mysterious antics l'."
“The statutes next call upon the matriculating candidate to swear
that he will keep aloof from all rope-dancers and actors, and from the
strifes and shows of gladiators' (Item quod, intra Universitatem
Oroniensem aut Praecinctum, absque speciali cenid Pice-Cancellarii, nec
Funambuli nec Histriones, qui quaestūs causá in Scenam prodeunt, nec
Gladiatorum certamina sire spectacula permittantur, nec Academici eis-
dem intersint.) Good gracious, Mr. Punch / is this the nineteenth
century—is Punch an institution of our land; have we got a Camp at
Chobham, and a Fleet at Spithead, or are we RIP WAN WINKLEs in
an inverse degree, who have slept backwards into the past? My
brain is fairly muddled, Sir, with the thought that I am about to send
my son PETERLoo to a place which I had fondly imagined to be the
centre of all enlightenment, and which Inow find retains the barbarities
of the darkest ages. I don't object to the rope-dancers and actors—
although I might, perhaps be inclined to ask why, SHAKspeARE,
and SHERIDAN, and BULWER-LYTToN should be condemned as im:
proper; and PLAUTUs, TERENCE, and Juvenal, decided to be the only
pure and proper dramatic guides of youth—I don't object, I say, to
my lad going to see
the rope-dancing
and acting, but I do
decidedly object to
his even having a
chance of obtaining
‘the special per-
mission of the Vice-
Chancellor’ to be
present at such de-
grading exhibitions
as the ‘sports of
the Gladiators.' I
shudder to think
and so does MRs.
N BRow N, Sir), that
my , who has
! been , so carefull
S brought up, will
S really “see before
s him the Gladiator
lie, his manly form
all cover'd o'er with
wounds;” and that
he will, perhaps—(I
can assure you, Sir,
that, MRs. BRowN
is obliged to have
recourse to her
smelling salts at
the bare thought of
such horrors)—that
he will perhaps set
his own slave ;
scout) to fight for
his amusement, and, like those frightful Romans that he is obliged to
read about, will be turning up his thumbs to give the dreadful signal
for his wretched servant's death! I must really pause a moment to
recover, my equanimity. Yet a bright thought strikes me! Perhaps,
after all, Mr. Punch, these gladiatorial exhibitions are only, intended
to assist the students in their classical pursuits, the mind being, we
know, often more speedily instructed through an º to the eye.
And this idea is supported by the words of the Statute that the
Students must not be present at such shows without the special per-
mission of the Vice-Chancellor. For, of course, if there are no gladia-
torial exhibitions in Oxford, the candidates for matriculation would not
be required to take oaths about them.
“It would fatigue both you and me, Mr. Punch (weakened as I feel by
these gladiatorial prospects), were I to make more lengthy observations
on the Oxford Statutes; for the subject is so º that it would
take me some time to travel through all the Statutum ests, and stop at
each. Yet I think I have told you enough about them to enable you
to give me your valuable opinion on the propriety and wisdom of
suffering my son PETERLoo to enter an university, to the privileges of
which he will only be admitted on the condition that he swears to ob-
serve the foregoing Statutes, and a host of others, to the utmost
of his power: ‘Scito te,’ says the Vice-Chancellor, as he gives the
young man a copy of the book which I have now been considering,
‘Seito te in matriculam Universitatis hodie relatum esse, sub hac conditione,
tempe, ut omnia Statuta, hoc libro comprehensa, pro virili observes.’
Nobody MUST HUNT wild BEASTs.
* “Tragedy of Remorse.” Act ii., Scene 1.
“But I will add one word in favour of a few more Statutes of this
‘Tit. XW.’ I am glad to see that, while º son will not be permitted
to draw a weapon upon another, or threaten him with a knife, dagger,
sword, or other species of weapon (cultellum, pugionem, gladium, aut
aliquot aliud genus tell aut distrina erit, aut intentarerit, cum minis, &c.),
et, that he will be allowed to bear a bow and arrow for the sake of
hº recreation (qui honesta recreationis causá arcus cum sagittis por.
tarerint), and will not be suffered to ride in, or be the charioteer of,
any vehicle, unless he is permitted to do so by the Proctors or the
Heads of his College, on account of his infirm health, or some other
reasonable cause (nisi cui propter infirmam raleludinem aut rationabilem
aliquam causam licentia, &c.). And yet, Mr. Punch, why does young
BELLINGHAM GREY tell me tales of Traps, and Dog-carts, and Tandems,
and Teams? Have all their charioteers infirm ièaith? or has that
young gentleman, in this as in other things, been practising upon the
credulity of

few probably have beheld the largest locomotive emit so extensive a
puff as the subjoined:–
“Grand, Fortentous, and Most Auspicious Event. Speedy and Imperative and

a firm that we will take the liberty of calling Messrs. Hokes AND Co.
. In the first place, MEssRs. Hokes are to be congratulated on º:
introduced a striking novelty into the English Tanguage the Wor
Fortentous; which, being big and indistinct, looms, as it were, at the
head of their advertisement, with a misty sublimity.
The mature of the impending event, denominated “fortentous” is
thus elucidated:–
“In consequence of the Proprietors being made Sole Agents for MacIntosh's
Registered Waterproof Dupallas, for Ladies' Sea-side, Ynchting, or Travelling wear,
they are determined to clear off their entire Stock—and, doing this, they sink ali
Personal Interest, forego every consideration of gain or lucre, renounce every motive
but the one Grand Object—that of a positive and absolute Clearance of the entire
Stock-and this, they are determined, must, will, may shall be accomplished, as the
Dupalla will be ready for Inspection in a few days.”
. This paragraph is a masterly composition—the very perfection of the
insinuating style. Sinking all personal interest, foregoing every con:
sideration of gain or lucre, renouncing every motive, but that of
desiring the positive and absolute clearance of a quantity of stock-
that “...one grand object” might obviously be accomplished in a simple
and effectual manner by making a bonfire of the goods; which, more.
over, would probably be the best thing to do with them. ... .
The conclusion of H. AND Co.'s Puff at once invites criticism—and
defies it—
“But words are but words, after all, so H. & Co. will proceed to lay before the Public
something of a more tangible nature. They pass on to facts, and facts are stubborn
things, but they unhesitatingly affirm that the incontrovertible facts given in the
annexed quotations of prices, only require ocular observation to establish their identity.”
The stubbornness of H. AND Co.'s facts is only exceeded º their
e
acquisitiveness; and perhaps, indeed, the latter propensity may be con-
sidered to have dictated their entire advertisement.

THE, traveller whose philosophy has, passed through these severe
trials, hungry, dirty, unshaved, weary, almost querulous, hurls his bag-
gage and himself into a venorable and heavy hackney coach (such a one
as DR., JoHNson might have hired to take MRs. THRALE to the play),
drawn by a pair of ragged grey ponies º over the rocky ways,
which people here have the face to call a pavement, Half-an-hour's
jolting º: him to the Hotel in the Rue de Richelieu, where he
demands a lodging. “But yes, Monsieur can have a chamber, but
certainly,” is the cheerful announcement of the concierge, a very pearl
among women, who advances from the lodge with a smile to welcome
the travel-stained, ill-favoured guest. Behold the steward who will
make Monsieur know.”. “Give yourself the pain to mount, Monsieur,”
says a solemn official in a fur-cap, with a reverence. The traveller
wearily ascends hundreds of shiny, slippery steps, till he arrives at the
third floor, where he pauses out Öf brºth. ” º mount always!”
says the respectable conductor: “But Monsieur, behold us, who are
arrived at the fourth. . This is in fine enough, is it not?” “But, no,
Monsieur, pardon; it is necessary to mount always.” The traveller's
hind legs are awfully done up; nevertheless, allons ! we arrive at
another floor. “Behold, Monsieur,” gaily says the steward, as he
opens the door of 299.
The first thing that strikes one is, that the last gentleman must have
been addicted to chewing garlic, and smoking yery bad tobacco. The
windows, which appear not to have been opened for weeks, enable the
fastidious English nostrils to analyse these flavours with unerring
certainty. , A little hall of entrance, furnished with a stove, a table,
and a bench which seems intended for the repose of exhausted creditors
before they make their unsuccessful appeal to milord, leads to an
apartment furnished both as bed-room and sitting-room, with great
taste and cheerfulness...The chairs, are pretty in form, and covered
with maroon velvet. There is a walnut fable, escritoire, and chest of
drawers. Over the chimney-piece of black marble is a mirror and a
clock. (There is not a room in Paris which does not boast a looking-
glass and a clock or clocks, though the latter may not É? In a recess
is a bed, which turns out, to be perfect... The last detail, however,
strikes the traveller, with horror, . He will be forced to wash with a
slop basin and a milk jug. What to do? The official in the fur cap

Ah, fº. they shall bring a hot bath to Monsieur at three francs. It

A shower-bath, a * or a sponging-bath he hath not seen, neither
can he conceive. The philosopher straightway orders a hot bath, and
makes a note never to leave his country for the future without a
collapsible caoutchouc arrangement, which may so far make him inde-
pendent of the º of continental civilisation. The res-
pectable steward retires, the hot bath arrives, painfully supplied with
water by a groaning gentleman in a blouse who evidently hates his
business, especially in its higher walks, Perhaps he will be a member
of a Provisional Government some day, and pay society off for his
present griefs. -
Under the potent influence of hot water the traveller gradually
returns to his usual serenity. The bravos of Dover, the exhibitions of
weakness on board, the steamer, the bureaucratic tediousness of the
douaniers, the insolence of the police, the jolting over the paré, the
interminable flights of stairs, all fade from his memory as he simmers
into a happier and more tranquil world of thought. Mysterious
analogy to the miracles of culinary science His heart, so to speak
stews into tenderness in like manner as the lobster, hideous an
savage, gradually is divested of his gross nature till he becomes the
delicate inmate of a Mayonnaise. of this pathetic thought the
sage reaps his chin, anoints his hair, makes an elaborate toilette, and
descends like JUPITER, from Olympus to mingle with men of lower
earth. He returns with confidence the smiling salute of the concierge;
Ah, Madame! you may now regard us; we carry fair linen, and smell

Indian file our course must keep in paths that faint and fainter grow—
Qnly by the spoils of those who went before, the track we know.
For in crevice, nook, and crann º e perceive that many
Of our predecessors any loads they liked not, here threw down,
Loyola’s whole knightly armour, and the ploughshare of the farmer
HAMPDEN; SouTHEY’s early drama of Wat Tyler; CodRus' crown; ,
Stout ARCHBishop BLACKBURN's cutlass; JoAN OF ARC's plain
hodden gown; - • *
GALILEQ's early notion of the Sun's diurnal motion;
BECKET's slily feigned devotion to his Royal Master's sway;
LoPE's, CALDERON's, CERVANTEs' swords, exchanged for pens, and
DANTE's -
en as force could not supplant his foes, he took a surer way);
RUTUs’ simulated weakness; strewn about the mountain, lay.
On these relics as we trample, fired by such a good example,
Some of our men leave an ample share * the flinty strand;
Pio NoNo's contribution is his taste for Revolution;
“Russell on the Constitution,” tumbles from its author's hand;
DisRAELI flings away his Fº to relieve the land; ..
Engineers let fall a shower of statements that the tractive power
Qf steam, just fifteen miles an hour cannot possibly exceed;
Štěpºn his determination quits, the due acceleration
Of amended legislation by mere quibbles to jº. * .
Pelham and Paul Clifford Bulweis drops, and climbs with greater speed.
Now small hillocks round us lying mark the spots where others, trying
Feats beyond their strength, sank dying, ere the summit they could galn.
LUTHER's love of toleration perished here by congelation; , .
There the too great elevation turned NAPOLEoN's seething brain;
Here a whirlwind caught DEscARTEs and swept him downward to the
plain.
And the day is well nigh ended, as against the steep extended,
Each by each in turn befriended, each to each for succour ºf: -
While the tempest, wellnighbrushing us away sweeps down, and gushing
m our very path come rushing mighty rivers' snow-fed springs,
And the avalanche's roar through far off glens and valleys rings; , .
But, a glimpse sometimes ºf: º the clouds beneath us flying,
Of the plain all peaceful lying, of the paths by which we came,
Or, along the road before us, of the fame close hanging o'er us–
Where the high celestial chorus greeting every one by name
Sings: “O! Hasten, favoured mortals! ten to the House of Fame!”—
Pressing upwards at a pace, meant for success, we reach the basement.
Shattered is each door and casement; ruined are the lower halls;
Not a word by us is spoken, seeing statues long so broken
That of what . were no token yet remains, and crumbling walls
Whence the mouldering tablet, carved with long-forgotten letters, falls
Through these chambers sadly wending, and to other halls ascending,
Newer they appear, though tending slowly to a like decay;
ARISTOTLE's, PLATO's pages, which, through long succeeding ages,
Q'er the minds of other sages held so absolute a sway;
Panels, which APELLEs used, with all the colours worn away;
Witty jests of PERIANDER; bulletins of ALEXANDER
Systems of ANAxIMANDER; fossil Pterodactyles found
In the old Homeric strata; speeches that could once create a
New soul in a dying state, or burst the chains a tyrant bound;
Qnce loved arts and cherished customs; moulder on the dusty ground.
To the higher rooms approaching, still we find the new encroaching
On the old; the Moderns poaching coolly on the Ancients’ land.
|NIEHUHR's stern determination many an ancient reputation
|Tumbles from its lofty station; HARDouTN's sacrilegious hand
Threatens Virgil; SHEPHERD scarce will let one ancient father stand.
Nay, Qur predecessors hearing our approach, and greatly fearing
Hurt from us, on our appearing, mostly haste to give us way;
BREwsTER with delight is glowing, laurels won from NEwton showing;
CUVIER yields his wreath to Owen, DAvy his to FARADAY;
HUME does homage to MACAULAY; FIELDING welcomes ThackERAY.
But though on the topmost story now we stand, we know our joy
Shall at best be transitory; brief our triumph is, though prou -
For, far down the mountain glancing, rays, that set for us, are dancing
On the º advancing columns of a mighty crowd; ..
As th; * ers cheer them on we hear them shouting long and
Oud.
That, as ours was, so their race is; that their course our track defaces;
That they crave our hard-won places; thrills us like a sudden flame;
And the high celestial chorus once again descending o'er us,
As of old it would implore us, sings, to urge them on, the same
Strain of “Hasten, favoured mortals' Hasten to the House of Fame!”

A BISHOP IN DISTRESS.
It is seldom that si of distress are hoisted from
the episcopal bench ; but the signals in question have
actually been hung out recently on behalf of the Bishop
of DURHAM., One of the “friends of the Church” has
made the melancholy, calculation that the good Bishop is
in such an impoverished state that, after making sundry
deductions, the poverty-stricken prelate has scarcely more
than seven thousand a year to live upon. Considering how
bishoprics go in the present day, we are astonished how the
prelacy of Durham can pay at the price, and how, in fact,
the bishop can manage to do it for the money. -
We shall probably be told next that it is a losing
concern, and that the occupant of the wretchedly seedy see
is about to give it up in consequence of his being “out of
pocket.” Werecommend the Bench of Bishopstofraternise
with the cabmen in making one common stand t the
system of reduced fares to which both have been doomed
in obedience to the modern principles of economy. The
Bench º to the association, but it is clear there
is some affinity between the episcopal and the other class
for the cabman can drive his horse, while both cabman and
bishop can drive a bargain.
A Mysterious Visitor.
Among the recent visitors to London we find notified
an extraordinarily dense fog. This visitor, though some;
what obscure, created considerable sensation, and a sort
of general illumination was got up by the London shop-
keepers on the occasion. The fog arrived by the Thames,
and made so much of the short time of remaining that the
visitor was nearly all over London in a very brief period.
Standing by their Orders.
FRENCHMEN having forei orders are, by a recent
decree, to be allowed henceforth to wear them. If the
French boot-maker in Regent Street should really wear all
the foreign orders he receives he will be papered from head
to foot, and it will be necessary for him to wear an addi.
tional placard .."; bill-stickers to beware, to prevent
them from mistaking him for a hoarding on which bills
may be exhibited.

Zoological Gardens to Jardin des Plantes.
THE following brief note has been forwarded by the Rhinoceros of
our Zoological Gardens to Cow, the Rhinoceros of the Jardin des
Plantes:—
“DEAR Cow, The French papers say you’re the first rhinoceros
in Europe since the time of the Romans. Gammon I’ve been here
more than these two years. But then, as it’s only London, what
should Frenchmen know about it?

CHINA AND BACK–IN NO TIME!
The Chinese revolution threatens to lead to other revolutions, not
only in England, but in Europe generally. ... As prognosticated by the
Times, tourists are making quite a rush to the Celestial Empire. The
CHUM-Li's, Choo-hoons, R-CH-BANKs, and other Belgravian man-
darins have already beat a precipitate retreat from Paris, Baden-Baden,
and such common-place places, and have arrived at their respective
mansions with a view to arrange pass to Pekin by the “tidal
trains.” Valets are busy packing and directing port-mantchoos (oh ')
for the scene of the contentions of the MANtchoo dyrasty, and the
youthful scions of Belgravia are already letting their tails grow in
anticipation of the tour. To these latter, Punch would whisper a
caution: they eat little dºgs in China. “Chinese in six lessons,”
“Chinese without a master,” may now be seen placarded tº:
while our old friend DR. BowRING is busily engaged, and will shortly
publish a Pekin guide book, with dialogues for every possible occasion,
which will enable the reader to distinguish a Joss house from a
Pagoda, and to ask for a “little more bird's nest,” in the most approved
accent. Those who are prevented by business or means (rom visiting
this new fashionable resort will doubtless become familiar with the
manners and customs of Pekin through the medium of panoramas, or
by becoming guests at the Feast of Lanterns and the flow of oil, as
held at the Surrey Zoological.

MR. ConDEN would be “sorry to see this country fighting for
Mohammedanism.” So should we. ...But in fighting against Nichol. As
of Russia for ABDUL-MEDjid of Turkey, we opine that we should

E
TO CORRESPONDENTS,
about their “Ascents of Mont Blanc,” you failed in
reaching the top; but even this remarkable feature in
the performance scarcely entitles you to publicity.
AffectionATE EMMA.—Your “Lines to My Little Bro-
ther (aged 23), on his accidentally Sitting down upon
some Stinging Nettles," have point and pensiveness,
but scarcely sufficient interest for the general reader
Still we hope your brother is better.
Chabury, having been thrown over by a young lady,
wishes to return everything she has ever sent him,
but finds a difficulty, from the fact that, her papa
having been a pastry.cook, her presents chiefly con-
sisted of jam tarts, Albert rock, and the like, which
Charley has eaten long ago. The dilemma is new
and delicate, but if CHARLEY's conscience is tender, he
had better estimate the price of the articles, and en-
close, it to the old Pattypan, from whom Miss had
clearly no right to take them. But, as has been clas-
sically said, Jams ate is.
BELLIcosus Jocosus-You may obtain a commission in
the army, by leaving your card at Lord Hardinge's
any day before four o'clock, and by calling for an an-
swer next day. You may give the servant one shil-
ling. This applies to §: line only. To become a
guardsman, call at the Junior United Service Club
any evening between six and nine, walk boldly into
the dining-room, and state your wish to any party who
may be dining together. The rest of the process you
will find very simple.
A BRIDE.--Do not distress yourself. Very likely he loves
you sincerely, and his winking at the bridesmaid might
be mere accident—the whisper was probably to tell her
how pretty you looked—and the pressure of her hand
gratitude for her ready acknowledgment of it. Even
the note may be explained; it was the address to which
she is to forward some present for you. Never worry
yourself about trifles—you have married him, and she
is cut out. Go on your tour rejoicing.
JEUNF PHILosophe.—Matter is, no doubt, as you contend,
an integral part of cognate consciousness; but do not
push this law to an absurdity. If homogeneous self-
antipathies come into conflict with inchoate retionalism
where will #. draw the line between casuality and
causality? Iladn't you better shut up?
ANxious JEMIMA.—There is no rule as to the number
of clergymen requisite at a wedding. One able-bodied
clerk in orders can do all that is necessary. The “as-
sisting" system is a ridiculous custom, introduced by
the Puseyites, by way of assimilating the ceremony to
that of Rome. At the same time, we admit that a
clergyman has a hard duty to perform in managing
some couples, and it is probably in these cases that he
calls in extra hands. Look at the announcements with
that idea in your mind.
SIGHT-SEER.—You may walk into Buckingham Palace
whenever you please, and without any ticket. But
when you enter the rooms in which any of the Royal
Family are sitting, you should put out your cigar, and
politeness, if not loyalty, dictates your making some
complimentary remark on the elegance of the building.
If you have apples or other fruit in your pocket, you
may offer them to the younger Princes and Princesses;
but we believe there is an objection to their R. H. ac-
cepting slices of cocoa-nut, or toffy.
WILLIAM P.-We think the young lady was quite justi-
fied in slamming the door in your face, and in throwing
the geranium pots at you from the two-pair window;
indeed, we do not see how any person calling trurualf a
lady could have acted otherwise.
Puzzled.—We have so repeatedly explained that R. S.
V. P., on a note of invitation, means “Write and Say
Wether you'll be Present,” that we are tired of answer-
ing the inquiry.
THEATRicus (Ebury Street).--We shall be happy to read
all your thirty-four plays, and, having done so, to re-
commend them to such managers as they may best suit.
There will be no difficulty about money, but we shall
be happy to make any advance you may require while
the plays are in rehearsal. One hundred guineas
an act is the lowest price paid at any Metropolitan
theatre.
SMACKARJRE Wopp AJEE (Calcutta).-We are much ob-
liged. The sketch of the Ayah running round the
compound after the Adjutant (bird), and the khan-
suma and the chuprassy pelting her with her own
tabeejes and banjoobunds, has been handed to one of
our artists, but we fear the nutcut will make but a
queer jummakur of it. So you have got your juwaub,
eh 2 Never mind, there are other young ladies in
India. Ask again.
QUERY.—You are wrong. Sardanápalus is accented on
the middle syllable; Zante is a dissyllable; Chobham
is pronounced Cobham; theátre is accented on the a,
Phaeton is sounded fee-à-ton; and Mr. Disraeli as
Mr. De Hisreelly. Attend, to these niceties if you
would be supposed to have lived in good society.
Young Housekeepee.—In September pickle garlic,
parsnips, and spinach, and pour villegar into each of
your marmalade pots, to prevent fermentation. Smear
the frames of your looking-glasses and pictures with
tar and treacle; and be careful that the pantry doors
and windows are left open at nights, as the autumn air
of the garden is cold for the cats, If you have beer
A
Exqurang MIND (Finsbury) requests that we will
- *::: §. an historical sketch łºś.m. generally,
with biographies of its principal professors, and an
analysis of their corresponding or contradicting tenets.
He also wants to know what is good for corns, and he
particularly desires answers to both his requisitions
this week.-On the first point we must refer him to
any Encyclopaedist, and on the second to any Chiro-
podist.
Bismillah.-Turkey is certainly in Europe, but there is
also a Turkey in Asia. There are doubtless wild
turkeys in America. But we suspect that some one
has been hoaxing you about the four Turkeys. To
your second enquiry, about “the directest way for you
to become a Member of Parliment" (usually spelt Par-
liament), we reply that you had better commence by
an educational process, which you cannot take up at
too early a stage.
Robeat Bloggs.-We never before met with the lines
you sent, commencing
To be, or not to be, that is the question.
Whether 'tis nobler, &c.
We agree with you in thinking that they are probably
from some play. But perhaps some of our readers can
furnish the information.
ALBINIA. E. M. has no reason to be “afraid" of our “sar-
castic speeches.” We never make any. Besides, her
handwriting is very pretty, and we dare say corresponds
with her face. But in reference to her petition that we
will “manage to introduce her to some nice, clever man,
with dark eyes, at least £400 a year, and a turn for
music,” we must pause. Is she sure she is in earnest?
Our young men do not like their affections to be sported
with. Let her ask her own heart, write again, abstain
from sealing with a fourpenny bit, and spell “inteuse”
with an “s,” not a “c.”
AMoR VIRTUtis is informed that we cannot tell him
where to get skeleton keys made.
Now Mt Ricohoo, and numerous other correspondents are
apprised that we believe the lady was born about the end
of the reign of King George the Second. But her address
is in the Court Guide, and they had better apply to her
personally. We do not profess to keep a Register
Office.
SAucy Lizzy.—The best cosmetic is health. Rise early,
take exercise, read Punch, and be asleep before dark,
and you will not need “washes,” which, as the Vicar of
Wakefield says, do no end of mischief. But if you must
use anything of the kind, a little cantharides and mus-
tard, rubbed into a paste with turpentine, laid on over
night, and the face washed with sulphuric acid in the
morning, will probably produce an alteration. But,
Lizzy, on no account use it unless made up by a
chemist.
A Youthful Aspiner.—We happen, at this moment, to
want neither “poetry" nor “a boy as can black boots
and run errands," but should a vacancy occur in either
department we will bear you in mind. Your “Lines to
the Two Warrens” scarcely do justice either to the
Blacking or the Blackwood one.
J. WHEELER BLAshby (or some such name).-How can
we tell you where to get a hippopotamus? But we
could tell you where to get a writing master, who
M. be a much better "companion for your leisure
ours.'
MUsidorA.—We need hardly say that we do recognise
the hand, and with pleasure. Your grace's secret is, of
course, perfectly safe with us, and we should write
privately, but have no right to disturb a lady's incog.
As your is pleased to prefer periwinkles we
must bow, but a good deal may be said for whelks. We
cannot, however, concur in your opinion of the music of
Rigoletto, which we must, with all deference, pronounce
“stunning.” Your enclosure shall be duly forwarded
*o the Marquis.
Amchimedes.—Yes, logarithms and decimals mean the
same thing, and to reduce decimals into the concrete
formula of logarithms, it is only necessary to extract
the cube root and take the middle term (of course
omitting fractions) until the tangents have for their
basis the sine of the complement. Any charity boy
could show you the process.
8. F. (Leeds).-We are surprised at such ignorance in a
place of progress like Leeds. The Letters of Junius
were not written by any man, but by Lady Mary
Wortley Montague, who conveyed them to the press
through her friend John Evelyn, author of the
of Silver (on which Phillips founded his, of the
Splendid Shilling), and she took the name of Junius as
a sort of joke, because at the time of writing them she
wore one of the Brutus crops introduced at the French
Revolution.
Jack Robinson.—Rather, and before you could mention
your own name. But when you send us grouse, send
a leash, not a brace.
MacDon ALD PAUL says, that the family of Skirwharmlie
is Scotch, and its members have been worthy to rank
with many of whom Scotia is most proud. Owing to
the unfortunate prejudices of past ages against treason,
arson, cattle stealing, and the like, the family was
continually decimated by judicial interposition, but
its representative keeps, or kept (for the police are
Łº tyrannical) a marine store shop near old Gravel
ane.
Rose AND MATILDA.—Very much ashamed of both of
ou. To write to two officers whom you do not
now, making them offers of marriage, might, under
certain circumstances, be defended. But to tie your
letters to the necks of two kittens, and to fling the
inoffensive creatures in at the military party's windows,
was contrary to all etiquette. Pray abstain from such
demonstrations, if you wish us to thiuk you ladies.
IIEIR-At-Law.—We are afraid we cannot assist you in
tracing your relative. There was, we think, a person
named Smith living either in Clapham or Shoreditch
during the early part of the present century, and you
might search the registries of the churches there. It
may aid you in identifying the party, if we add that he
was in the habit of smoking a good deal on Saturday
evenings. We shall be happy if our information
enables you to recover your estate and title.
RUN1c.—Your lines are very pretty, and shall appear as
soon as ever we can make room for them, probably in
September or October, 1873. You need not wait until
their appearance before sending the game.
Juvenis.-The epigram is by MARTIAL, and runs,
correctly, thus:–
Spes primá facie largo factotum amicus,
Curia per contra nil desperandum gratis.
Which may be translated—but, on second thoughts, we
invite our young classical friends to send us in their
translations of this very terse and sparkling epigram.
The name of the first and second best shall be given, as
also that of the worst, if he lets us know it.
Joshua R.—We are not aware that the “Finding the
Dead Body of Harold" has ever been made the
subject of a painting, but now you have suggested it,
we have no doubt that some artist will take the idea
with thankfulness. We are always glad to be the
vehicle for conveying such hints, and may mention
that we have often wondered that neither Gil Blas, nor
the Vicar of Wakefield has supplied subjects for
painters.
MURPHY.—We do not profess to be weatherwise, but we
believe that it has been observed, that before rain
swallows fly high, dogs are unusually brisk and active
and will not eat grass, waterfowl keep on the surface of
the water, fish bite greedily, toads disappear, and sheep
and cattle seem remarkably calm and comfortable.
We can hardly tell you “how to avert the consequences
of rain,” but a good deal might be done by staying
within doors.
A Mothen.—Your excuse is a common one, but it is
your business to know that he is out. Respecting the
demand of your youngest son for cigar money and a
latch key, we think you perfectly justified in reſusing
either until he is eight years old. And though we
consider all coercion as objectionable, we cannot blame
you for fastening the street door top-bolt, which is
above his reach, to prevent his going alone to Vauxhall
at half-past eleven at night. But beware of severity,
and talk to him of the beauty of virtue, and the social
advantages of subordination.
BAckfin.—-Sturgeon abound in the Hampstead ponds,
but as they belong to the Lord of the Manor, Sir T. M.
Wilson, no one will fish for them. We have ourselves
taken salmon, in the New River, of from sixty to eight
pounds, but the tall iron railings sadly interfere §
an artistic throw of the ". We doubt whether the
fine trout you describe can be caught in Peerless Pool.
From off the terrace of the Houses of Parliament, now
that the session is over, anglers are seen hooking John
Doreys and smelts daily, but it is stated that the
fag ends of the members' cigars bave given them a
cabbagy flavour.
A Novice.—Always happy to give any information on
etiquette. If you are on the top of an omnibus, and
see a lady walking, to whom you are but slightly
known, call out “Iſiſ" and kiss your hand to her in a
facetious manner. If she be of superior rank, it is
usual, though not necessary, to put your hat on the end
of your stick and spin it round, but discretion must be
your guide. True politeness is that which places every
one at ease.
ADA JANE.-We suspect poor AdA JANE is in rather an
awkward position. We cannot see how she is to prevent
her cousin's marriage with the young nobleman to
whom AdA JANE herself has taken a liking. She
might, certainly, go to the intended bride's mother, re-
present her own feelings, and ask her to give up the
cousin's brilliant match—such things are done on the
stage. But we doubt whether it would do in Belgravia.
Let ADA JANE catch a young nobleman for herself,
there are plenty about.
HENRY E. (Walton).-How can that be? The square of
the half of any chord of a circle is equal to the product
of the sagittae of the opposite arcs, that is, the segments
of the diameter bisecting the chord, or the versed sines
of half the opposite arcs. From this the Jews argue,
and we agree with Colonel Sibthorp in thinking they
argue rightly, that no man can, by self-measurement,
get a decent fit from a tailor.
W. W. and F. F.—Your accommt of your ascent of
Primrose Hill is very exciting, but the feat has been
performed before. To be sire, we observe that, like
some other gentlemen who just now write to the papers
in the house, driuk it.

turning on of the gas to recognise—these are trials and triumphs of
temper, which are so many proofs of martyrdom, scarcely to be sur-
passed by any you will }.} in “Fox's Book of Martyrs.” We propose,
therefore, that some statue be erected in honour of SAINT CABBJE ;
and we think Scotland Yard, which has been the scene where he has
been made to bleed so often for his injured cause, would be the fittest
spot for the erection. Designs for the statue should be thrºwn Qpen
to public competition and sent in, for selection, to the Police Com;
missioners. For ourselves, we are anxious to contribute our small
mite to the worthy object, and beg, therefore, to suggest the following
appropriate design:- -
et a wild horse—the wildest that can be found in the Green Yard-
be harmessed to the craziest cab that can be picked off a nocturnal
cab-stand, and on the top of that cab let poor Cabbie, be fastened
à la Mazeppa. An aureol, made of dirty straw, should shine round his
head; his whip should be lyin º his side, broken in two, and
suspended round his neck should §e is badge of suffering, on which
should be marked the fatal word “64.” On the box should be seated a
Member of Parliament (the conventional long ears of an M.P., might be
left out on this occasion), with the New Cab Act in his hand, driving
the poor Cabman to desperation. The motto on the panel might be
“For WHEEL AND Woe.” - -
º: above design, we are sure, would work up into a very magnificent
statue.
In the meantime we hope CARDINAL WiseMAN will exercise all his
influence with the Pope, or whoever may be the great almanac-maker
at Rome, to have SAINT CABBIE introduced by the side of SAINT
FIACRE in the Romish Calendar.
A Present from the Pope.
His Holiness—says the Journal de Bruzelles—has sent to the young
bridegroom the DUKE of BRABANT, “a fragment of the wood of the
manger which formed the cradle of our Saviour.” The Pope has a
constant supply of relics on hand to be bestowed on fitting persons and
fitting occasions. Enthrone Liberty in the Capitol, and the Pope, no
doubt, would send her a relic; nothing less than “the Kiss of JUDAs?”
Poor SHAKSPERE!
THE fiddles are once more at him. Again is SHAKSPERE to be
bow-strung. WERD1–we learn from the Post-is putting King Lear
and Hamlet to cat-gut. It is, moreover, whispered that Hamlet is
destined for the Princess's; Hamlet to be sung by MR. CHARLEs
KEAN, who is expected to make a great hit in the solo of “To be or
tiot to be,” in which he will accompany himself on the Jews'-harp.

REVIEW OF THE MEDICAL LINE.
A GRAND review of the Medical Staff of the Metropolis was held
yesterday by SURGEON-GENERAL Punch; the officers . men of the
various parishes presenting themselves in professional rank and file.
The colours of the corps have become rather faded in consequence of
exposure to foul air and exhalations. They are red, blue, and green,
in correspondence with night-lamps and shop-window bottles ; and are
emblazoned with the names of various localities in which the force
performing services of danger, has triumphed over cholera, typhus, an
other foes; as “ Fig Tree Court,” “ #. Dock,” “Twister's Alley,”
“Paradise Row,” “Mount Pleasant,” “Slumson's Rents,” “Grimes’s
Mews,” &c.
The troops went through the exercise of prescribing, compounding,
mixing, and the other evolutions of asham id: with disease; executing
their operations with great rapidity and precision. The mortar practice
was much admired.
The appearance of the officers and men was better than could have
been expected, considering the generally small amount of their pay.
A SHOE-LANE RALEIGH !
THE Morning Herald has a beautiful, leader upon, the QUEEN's visit
to Dublin; a very beautiful bit of work, indeed. The Herald praises
with manly devotion the name of woman, and the name of mother.
But— -
“But when to both these there is added the title of our QUEEN ' she may not only,
as in the days of RALEigh, step on our cloaks, but our-
What do you think? Guess. Breasts? No. Guess again. Hearts *
Oh dear no–
“but our coats /"
If the loyalty of the Herald continues—regardless of expense—to
rise in this manner, the next climax may be thus—
“Not only on our coats, but our waistcoats!”
There, we trust, the loyalty of the Herald will, if only for the sake
of appearances, stop.
The Wrongs of Scotland.
Scott AND-it is said by Scotch patriots—is shamefully snubbed and

thistle is indigenous? Why not ? Honest SANcho says, “Let every
tub stand on its own bottom.” And in like manner, why not every
Scotch knight sit on his own Thistle *

REMARKABLE SELF-SACRIFICE.
Now that Parliament stands

of alſ, parties consists of
partridges and grouse, the
journals naturally supply
the place of political news
with wonderful shots, and
other marvellous items of

narrative may, perhaps, be regarded as a shaft of waggery aimed at the bull §.ey;
of faith. A correspondent, however, who is farther North than even the North
British Daily Mail, assures us that it tells the truth, though not the whole truth.
That a bird was spitted on one of the harrows in the manner described, is a positive
fact; But the additional circumstance should have been mentioned, that a couch-
fire having been made between the harrows, for the twofold purpose of burning the
weeds, and drying the implements the more effectually, the creature was found not
only sp.tted but roasted. It further remains to be stated, that the bird which was
so silly as § itself, or get spitted, in its blundering flight, was not a duck, but
a goose; which thus became its own cook. Last of all the coincidence deserves tº
be recorded, that the feathered simpleton, which, previously to the stupid Act, had
just been feeding, º in an adjoining garden, was discovered, with some
presentiment of its destiny, to have stuffed itself with sage and onions.

AN ABODE OF BLISS.

an advertisement of a steamer for sale at Sydney, which really seems
worth attention. It professes to be so complete in every department
that, if it should happen to go to pieces, there are ample arrangements,qn
board for building another vessel as a substitute. There is “a double
set of machinery;” and, in fact, there appears to be everything in
duplicate, so that, if the vessel should ºil, go down, there is a

double º of passengers, so that if anything, happened to either
there wo e sufficient substitutes at hand. Consi ering that the
announcement comes from a land in which the gold mania is at its
height, we cannot wonder at the duplicity of the speculation, since
double-dealing is thought nothing remarkable where all are thinking
of nothing but getting gold.
The Governesses in Despair.
"DEAR MR.PUNCH,-The Chinese language will no doubt be added

THE CHELSEA GHOST.

St. Barnabas, , and

know how many—
churches, chapels,
liter and scien-
tific "...
schools, and other
institutions, mainly
intended for the ex-
orcising of igno-
rance, a Ghost has
just dared to show
itself, and hundreds
of fools have at:
tended its levee.
Pond Street is the
locality—the name
is suggestive of stag-
nation and green-
mess—and here has
been seen a terrible
apparition, “A Tall
Man with a Death-
like Face and Snowy
Garments Reaching
to his Feet.” Allow-
ing for the poetry
which broke out in
snow, the description
serves wonderfully
for an Irish labourer
who, having been º;', beaten in one of the religious ceremonies
of his nation, gets out of bed in the night-gown lent him by, the
hospital. But we will believe the Ghost to be veritable, and to have
a mission. Let us see what it is.
First, a sturdy young “excavator” goes up-stairs into the ghostly
chamber, and being in his cups, is the easier victim to the saucer eyes,
which flame on him so hideously that he falls down in a fit.
*--- —º
Secondly, another “excavator” (if these poor spade men have been
disturbing the Ghost's earthly tenement in its grave, justice would
have sent the remonstrating spectre to the surveyor's office, or the
contractor's counting-house) goes up-stairs, only to fall down in a fit
like his predecessor.
Thirdly, an older labourer comes home, and being informed of the
affair, proceeds to enquire into it. Stricken down in horror, his fits
last for hours.
The neighbourhood, now clustered in agitation round the haunted
ouse, clamours for the Police. Three gallant and well-grown officers,
uniformed, and belted, and braceleted, and bludgeoned, march fearlessly
into the house, prepared to say “Come, cut it,” or “Be off out of
that,” to the grimmest phantom on the walk. In a few minutes the
lettered heroes rush out of the dwelling, their horror untold; but a
policeman, paid a sº a week (less deductions), must have seen
something remarkable when he declares, that “untold gold” should
not induce him to stay in the place... And these legal authorities
fºund the householders to leave the dreadful house as soon
as DOSSlole.
he mission, you see, for which a supernatural visitor is sent from
the world of spirits, prospers. Three labourers go into fits, and three
policemen are frightened out of their duty. Then doors bang all night,
and groans are º: a mob blocks up the street until five in the
morning. And Mr. Punch, who, as may often be seen in the streets,
is ready to tackle any ghost, with that unhesitating club of his, goes
the next aſternoon to Pond Street, and finds the assembly again in full
force, but not very reverent, and discussing the ghost’s nature with
that freedom of epithet characteristic of street conversationists.
Mr. Punch was very much shocked to hear the roar of laughter which
greeted a proposition, made by a gentleman in his shirt-sleeves and
with a short pipe, to the effect that if any one would “stand”
(Mr. Punch believes he reports the right word) a vessel of malt liquor,
he would go into the house (which appears to have resembled that of
SAU), and inflict upon the Ghost—as, to whose future destiny the
jº. expressions showed that he had made up his mind—a species
of castigation which certainly should be reserved for extreme cases.
And Mr. Punch further reports that all, along the King's Road, and
near the Hospital, and even towards theatrical Brompton, many of
whose inhabitants have rejoiced to see “the Ghost walk,” th
Clearly, therefore, the supernatural visitor is fulfilling the important
...” for which only can we suppose he has been sent from another
World.
When the clergy of the neighbourhood heard of the affair, they were
reatly moved. One of them, a young Barnabasian, threw down
the sweetest handful of charmin†† flowers, with which he was
making an altar-wreath for Sun #. rushed into the crowd, and affec.
tionately, but earnestly, reproved his humbler brethren for ...;
faith in such vulgar and impious folly. He entered the haunted house,
walked all over it, and throwing up every window in t addressed a
few words of gentle ridicule from each; and he j. aWa
the whole º his church, where he gave them some sound,
shrewd counsel, which will º: spoil a Ghost’s market in that
quarter for some time. Others of the clergy, roused by the spectacle
in Pond Street, have been equally active; and perhaps after all, this
was the Ghost's real mission. In this case “it is an honest ghost,
that let Punch tell ye.”
The Roman Catholic priests of the iº however, look at the
matter in another light, and regard the “Deathlike face” as the
editor of, the Tablet does the Salette miracle, where the Virgin
astonished the weak mind of the pig-boy and girl, and sent a very
proper message to the French people not to swear. They say that the
Ghost is that of somebody who, not having paid up the priest’s “dues,”
will haunt the neighbourhood until somebody else pays them for him.
The landlord of the house, who seems to have most reason to complain
of the apparition, intends to pay these “dues,” and charge them in the
rent, unless the next tenant likes to take the Ghost with the fixtures.

LOUIS NAPOLEON AT BOULOGNE.
It is said that “the authorities” are making extensive preparations
for the reception of Louis NAPOLEoN at Boulogne. As this is not his
first visit, and as it is usual on occasions of great public ceremonials,
to refer to “precedents,” we may expect to find the “authorities”
searching their annals in order to discover how Louis NAPOLEoN was
formerly received. It is not necessary to go very far back in making
the inquiry, as it is as recent as 1840 that Louis NAPOLEoN was
“received" by the authorities of the place. On that occasion he was
met by the National Guard, who, with great valour, fired a salute of
loaded muskets on the present Emperor and his handful of almost
defenceless friends. No other carriage being in readiness, a bathing-
machine, was provided for the reception of the Prince, who was
conveyed, amid a detachment of soldiers, to the prison in the upper
town. The Imperial eagle, instead of being displayed on banners, was
present in person, and was removed by the “authorities” to the
abattoir. - - -
Having reached this result of an Fº into precedents, we wait
patiently for the official programme of the fêtes which will take place
in honour of the Emperor's visit to Boulogne. It is quite clear from
the events of the last four years that the watering place alluded to was,
in 1840, wholly unacquainted with the real sentiments of the French
nation. We must suppose that, in 1853, it comes much nearer the
- e popular
invitation was “Come on; let’s go and see that blessed §.

AUTUMNAL PROMOTIONS.
As the Autumn advances, certain promotions always take place,
which we never notice at any other period of the year. We beg to
record the following amongst those which have recently occurred:-

'avilion Theatre, promoted into Signor Jonesi, “the celebrated

the least denied by MRs. SuthERLAND, until she is presented with

THE ENGLISH HIPPOPOTAMUS, AT THE ZOOLOGICAL
GARDENS, to THE FRENCHDITTO, AT THE “JARDIN
DES PLANTES.”
“Mon chER HIP.,-Ihave been reading the account of łº glorious
reception at Paris. Don't you allow your simple head to be turned
by the homage you have been receiving. Look at me, and profit
by the ridiculouslesson. -
“But ashort time ago I was as great a favourite as you now are.
I was run after worse than a Nepaulese Ambassador—though what
little lustre there was about me was all my own—not a single diamond
shone in my ears! and my nose (at present so snubbed) was uncon-
scious of the smallest precious stone ! No valuable Cachemire was
coiled round my head, that, in a moment of admiration, I could unroll
and lay at the feet of my fair worshippers. What little merit Ipossessed
consisted in my native ugliness; and though I flatter º an as
ugly now as I was then, still no one runs after me now.
“As it was with me so it will be with you. My word for it, your
nose will be similarly put out of joint by M. Durn, or some other
monstrosity. I was the rage, the fashionable lion of the day.
Thousands of ladies tore their dresses, and fought with their parasols,
to get a passing peep at me. They called me “dear,’ ‘duck,” “pet,
.# other fond terms of female endearment; and much they care about
me at present! ... Casts were made of me in º and adorned
the pastrycooks' windows...You saw my portrait, in the frontispiece
of every polka. No periodical was complete without my biography,
whilst my bulky proportions were multiplied in a thousand different
shapes, either in º ink-stands, salt-cellars, butter-boats, or
else figured on ladies' brooches...And where, I ask, am I now? I hide
º in the mud of my bath, with shame and indignation, when I think
of the base ingratitude of the public. -
“I cannot believe you are any uglier than I was. I will not pay you
so egregious a compliment. I will say you possess the same bountiful
share of recommendations. In that case I beseech you, mon cher
animal, not to allow your brain to be affected by, the popular incense
that at present is being burnt under your admired nostrils. It is ever
the fickle taste, of Fashion to forget to-morrow the idols, it is
worshipping to-day. , Believe me, and, I speak as one who is both a
ippopotamus and a brother, you will be as little run after, as little
cared about this time next year, as I now am. At present you are
un charmant hippopotame, the fººted curiosity of the moment; wait
another twelyemonth, and they will say of you, as they do of me, that
you are nothing better than a great pig, or, worse still, they will caii
ou probably, in their insulting vernacular, ‘un gros cochon.’ Ponder,
wise, and don't grow too conceited.
“Such is the affectionate advice of
“Mon cher Hip, your old camarade du Nil,
“THE HIPPopotamus (of the Zoological Gardens).
"P.S. Will you believe it, the fashionable world is now running,
‘like mad,' º two little monkeys they call Aztecs "...The ladies
actually kiss them . It makes one sick merely to think of it.”
Fearful Accident to a Great Civic Authority.
THE Times, in describing the late accident on the Great Northern
Railway, assures us, first, that the LoRD Maxoº. escaped, with a
trifling injury, but on the next day informs us that his p con-
tinues “to swallow with difficulty.” As his º was on his way
to the Cutlers’ Feast, and as his Lordship's tenure of office ceases on
the 9th November, Punch does not see how the Times can reconcile
its first with its second statement.

MR. Punch in china. º
º
INCE each gobe-mouche is speaking of
anking or Peking,
And as each critic, wit, or professional
er,
Explains that you can't choose but see
that the Mantchews -
Must soon be entirely driven from China
And that a high price on our Pekoe an
Hyson
Must be the infallible end of the clatter,
Mr. Punch, who's a strong goiſt for
Souchong and Congou,
Determines to go and see what is the
matter,
It boots not to say how he goes; for
to-day
Young and old, grave and gay, so affect
locomotion,
That the press every hour produces a
h gº; O
Of “Rough Notes of a Slide on the Greaft Frºzeg,Ocean',
Or “A ºil. Ramble from Stamford to Stambol;
Ör “The Steppes of the Cossacks, by one who has walked in 'em;”
Yºunci's plans were,
And I’m sure that whate'er Mr. -
if these tourists could prosper, he wouldn't be baulked in 'em.
Íñke the witches, perchance, he might choose to advance,
And so order his coachman to bring out his brougham;
Ör ask Phoebus to lead forth that spirited steed,
Which is furnished, in turn, by each Muse, with a groom:
But, however, we'll fancy hin safely in ºns:
Or Quantong, where, taking his place mi the great, he,
Like any philandering son of a mandarin,
Sits enjoying his opium cum dignitate.
Rich and stately pagodas he finds on the road, as º:
He goes throu i. the land, for the most part erected, º
When the smallest house-tax on Gaul, Briton, or Saxon, , ;
Would have stood not the least chance of being collected."
Wide canals, dykes, and sluices he sees, too, whºse uses
Were applied both to traffic, to drainage, and tillage,
When a }. rain had undone both Paris and Lºndon,
To the mud they were made of restoring each village.
And they show #. the pages of China's first sages,
ich were printed for sale in the towns of the Tartar;
When, with us, scarce aspark of wit gleamed in one clerk,
Andie Monfront "his mark” set to our Magna Charta.
They declare, too, that banking quite flourished in Nanking,
And that printed bank-notes were in .#. at the hour
en our yeomen and reeves exchanged bannocks for beeves,
And seldom bought less than a sheep’sworth of flour.
And he learns their silk factories furnished phylacteries,
Robes, handkerchiefs, tapestry too, in the jolly days .
When our sires wore a quaint but light coat of blue paint,
With a few streaks of red upon high days and holidays:
And that long, long 'ere BACON and BUNGAY were taken
Unawares by the sudden blow up of their crucible,
Each Chinese fire-eater had found.“vile saltpetre"
To the purpose of killing “tall fellows”. reducible.
Then the more he enquires concerning their sires,
The greater the reason he sees to anticipate
That much of the mystery shrouding the history
Qf Europe, the records of China will dissipate; , .
For as old Hoang TI built the wall, strong and high,
To check the fierce Huns as it now checks the Tartars,
Not long after old HANNIBAI, conquered at Cannº,
And then wasted his time in his smug winter quarters;
And as if China's sons had not driven those Huns
Into Europe by many a º: battle, a
Longer respite, Iween, for old Rome there had been,
Nor ope so early had bowed to an ATTILA.
It is clear that a stranger and far greater danger -
Threatened Rome when on Carthage her wrath she was wreaking;
And that CAT0 the Censor had shown greater.sense, or
Discernment, by crying “Delenda est Peking !” -
But alasſ ail these stories of China's old glories,
Mr. Punch plainly sees it is vain to recal,
Since the course of the nation in civilisation
Has for been typified best by its wall.
No more, like his sires, the Chinese aspires
In science and art to be some new step;
#. the . *}. f 80 *:::: drill, t
eeps performing a kind of perpe se-step.
For §: population, the hand cultivation
Of the still fertile country no longer suffices;
Though to drain swamps they toil, and to carry up soil
- To the rocky hillsides, no unfrequent device is.
And, on ºl. dainties, poor Punch fit to faint is,
As he cries, “Nought but famine gives such things a price!”
“Rats and mice, and such small deer,” snakes j puppies are all dear.
As helping to eke out their pittance of rice.
Now whilst thus his quick wit is on their antiquities
Busy as that of a LAYARD or BonoM1 ;
Qr, like that of M'CULloch, of pig, sheep, and bullock,
Rice and tea, is discussing the social economy, .
There springs up a great riot near, and the patriot
ly comes marching along in its pride;
§. as º go, “We are hostile to Fôl”
The º the josses on every side,
And smash, in their scrimmages, all BUDDHA’s images
Whilst a new-fangled creed by their chiefs is ropounded,
Which they call Christianity; thou º, when Punch comes to scan it, he
Finds it is but CoNFUCIus his creed “worse confounded.”
Now, in hamlet or city, all quarter or pit -
To their long hated rulers the natives refuse; º
“Peacock's plumes” and “Red buttons” are nought but lost muttons,
Whilst impatient his badges of serfdom to lose,
Each Chinese without fail parts his head from his tail,
And henceforth minds his foupées instead of his queues.
Mr. Punch—whilst applauding their courage, ºšiting
Their natural wish to recover their freedom—
Still thinks that society may with propriety
Expect him a brief “screed o' doctrine” to read 'em.
So he summons their leader, and says, “You indeed err,
#:# that this triumph your läbour will terminate;
When the Mantchews have vanished, there still must be banished
Many faults which for ages you’ve suffered to germinate.
Your ºf.” inhumanity, cunning, and vanity,
Which still are so great that I cannot ignore 'em
Helped the Mantchews, who knew § right well, to subdue you,
As the Mongols and Khaikas had oft done before 'em.
You have broken your chains of to-day with small pains;
But hereafter, if courage and honesty you lack, you
Will be conquered once more—like your fathers of yore,
By the might of some yet to come KUBLAI or HULAKHU;
For the hordes of the North are still ripe to burst forth,
As oft in their tents the rude minstrel or rhymer
Tunes his harp in the praise of those glorious days,
When their sires fought bravely for GENGIs or TIMUR.
To conclude. If you’d thrive, you must earnestly strive
To rub out of men's minds the stern dictum of TENNyson,
t in Europe one day beats a year in Cathay,’
And thereto Punch heartily gives you his benison.”

º HINT TO RAILWAY ROGUES.
º
THERE is a certain arrangement which Railway Directors would do
well to adopt in the construction of their time-tables. It is one very
É. prevalent among that class of tradesmen whom Railway
Impanies, for the most § resemble, generally, in their manner of
doing business, considered with reference to fairness and honesty. At
present, the hours of arrival and departure are given in the tables—
#. with a simple disclaimer of the obligation to keep them. This
is like giving an I.O.U., under protest of non-liability for the amount;
a coarse and clumsy mode of shirking, responsibility, and, what is
worse, an ineffectual one, being impracticable in law. A far preferable
device would be that of printing the hours in large letters with the
qualification of “somewhere about” prefixed in very small. ; this
expedient the appearance of contradicting an engagement would be
presented without the reality, and the comfort of security would
attend the advantage of swindling.
Rival Reaping-Machines.
WE hear a great deal about the merits of some rival reaping-
machines, but we know of nothing that can equal in the force of rivalry
those wonderful reaping-machines—a barrister’s tongue, and a phy.
sician's finger and thumb; which are the means used by both in reaping
their tremendous harvests.
AN IMPERIAL SWEEP.
WE believe there is a species of long broom, called “a Turk's
Head.” Now we should say, that the EMPEROR OF RUSSIA would
soon make a clean sweep of the Mohammedan Church, Empire and all,
if the Sultan would but only put the “Turk's Head” in his hands.

“HOW COOL AND NICE THE FRENCH-POLISHED FLOORS ARE i BUT-
UGH!–OH DEAR 1–HOW HARD !”
QUEEN CHRISTINA IN ENGLAND.
QUEEN DowageR CHRISTINA-who has brightened our darkened land with the lustre of her
presence—is sedulously studying all our London institutions, in order to do her best to take back
and naturalise copies thereof in Spain. She has already visited, the Bank of England, and
exhibited the most interesting astonishment on learning that the dividends were regularly paid
to the public creditor. At first, she received the intelligence laughingly, as a bit of †.
badinage, the best joke that the dull English cºuld get up for her. However, the Governor of
the Bank of England, having gravely assured HER Esty that the Bank regularly paid the
public creditor—he moreover produced the books in testimony of the pleasing fact—ChiustiNA,
as an ex-queen and a lady, with a frank smile and a º curtsey, avowed her belief in the
singular custom.
CurtistiNA, though still handsome and by no means old, is nevertheless addicted to serious
meditation. It is said that, in token of her contempt of all worldly fopperies, she has worked more
than one flag for fast-sailing, vessels, trading to the coast of Africa, and landing—(LucIFER
willing and able)—their black merchandise
at the Havannah. The flag has at once been
typical of the º of trade, and the final
nothingness of all commercial things; i.e.--
a Death's Head and Cross-Bones embroidered
in white silk upon black satin; and dul
blessed by HER MAJESTY's confessor. It is
said that HER MAJEsty, in admiration of
Uncle Tom, offered a very handsome testi-
monial to Mrs. Beechen Stowe; namely,
a little black boy, wonderfully accomplished,
as page. This story, however, wants con-
firmation.
We keep the most interesting intelligence
for the last. HER MAJESTY has paid a visit
to the cemeteries of Norwood, Kensal Green,
and Highgate; and—she is an excellent
artist—was so much º: with the last,
that she made a sketch of the burial-grounds
with her own royal hand, and sent it off by
express to Madrid, ... by an auto-
graph letter to her queenly daughter, recom:
mending the sketch to be followed (with all
allowance for limited space) in the new
cemetery (when granted) to the Protestant
English.
AN OMNIBUSIAN SONG.
(After Banny Coax wall.)
RIDE | Who rides
In a 'bus that taketh twelve insides?
Ah! who is this lady fine .
That falls on this lap of mine?
A lady is she,
As big as three.
1 prefer her room to her company.
Smoke! Who smokes
To the great annoyance of other folks?
Ah! who is this snob so fine?
A gent, Sirs! a gent
He comes with the noxious scent
Of tobacco, beer, and wine:
Far better that he
On the roof should be.
I prefer his room to his company.
COTTON AFLOAT.
The Americans have made another magni-
ficent discovery of the use of cotton. Cotton
makes the best cordage for ships. It runs
freer, and ties tighter knots. (The knots
hitherto caused by cotton all Uncle Tom's can
bear witness º Cotton, moreover, makes
the best sails; for the Sovereign of the Seas,
Yankee craft, has sails as well as rigging of
the fabric. What a slave-clipper might be
rigged by the appropriate cotton! What a
thing of #. ( * death) to walk the middle-
passage; to fly in and out of African bays and
creeks! But one ceremony would be needed
to make such a craft perfect. She ought to
be christened by the Queen Dowager of
SPAIN. As HERMAJESTY is about the richest
slaveholder, the very largest dealer in human
flesh, it would be very appropriate that she
should give a name to the kidnapping craft.
We would suggest as a name The Christina.
The slaver rigged with cotton, and the
Dowager Queen rigged with the * of
slavery, would be worthy of one another.

PERVERSION OF A CLERGYMAN.
* that are sent to some
of our contempora:
| ries, must be altered
º by them. Here, for
instance, is a notifica-
tion, extracted from
the Lincoln, Rutland,
and Stamford. Mer-
- cury, by which un-
- - -- - - principled journal it
has evidently been corrupted in the grossest manner-
THE REVEREND RALPH WILLIAM LIONEL TOLLEMACHE
having obtained the exclusive right of Shooting, Sporting, &c., over the whole of
the Manor of Clipshaw (except Addah Wood), and Lands belonging to J. M. Paget,
Esquire, in the Lordship of Pickwoºth, in the county of Rutland, hopes, that all
ualified Persons will refrain from trespassing upon the said Lands; as also upon
nds in the Lordship of South WITHAM, over which he has the right of Shooting,
&c., including Lands belonging to the Blue Bull Farm in the Parish of Castle
Byrnax and the Hamlet of Loºthoaps, in the county of Lincoln; and in the Parish
of Thistleton, in the county of Rutland; also on the Blue Point Farm in the Parish
of WYMonphax, in the county of Leicester.
All Poachers, &c., will be proceeded against with the utmost rigour of the law; and
Ma: Toºlkwachs hereby gives notice, that he will pay to any Person who will give
such information as will lead to the conviction of any Person or Persons, for any breach
whatsoever of the Game Laws upon any of the aforementioned Lands, the sum of Ten
Shillings upon each such conviction.
South Witham, August 22, 1853.
. In the abºve announcement should be made the following correc-
tions :—For “Shooting, Spºrting, &c.,” read “Preaching, Praying,
&c. i. for “Manor,” read “Parish;” for “Persons,” read “Parsons;”
for " Cºunty of Lincoln,” read “Diocess of Lincoln,” &c. &c.
. For “All Poachers, &c., will be proceeded against with the utmost
rigour of the law,” read “All Preachers will be proceeded against with
the utmost rigour of the Gospel”—by “Poachers,” understanding to
be meant unauthorised fanatics and disseminators of false doctrine.
Understand, also, that the hope expressed by MR. TolleMACHE, “that
all qualified Parsons will refrain from trespassing,” &c., means that he
does nºt wish other clergymen to interfere with his people; Lastly,
ſº “Conviction,” read." Conversion;” for “for,” “from;” and for
Game,” “Divine.” This is a quaint way of expressing himself on
the part of the REVEREND RALFH WILLIAM LIONEL TóLLEMACHE;
but John BUNYAN was quaint; so was John Wesley : so was
Row1AND HIII–why not MR. TolleMACHE”
..It is too bad to represent a Minister as addicted to the sports of the
Field, when, in fact, he devotes himself to the labours of the Wineyard;
as ºf stubble and cover with retrievers of the canine species,
instead of perambulating the highways and by-ways with Scripture
Readers; and in place of converting criminals to rectitude, as con-
verting poachers into criminals.
The *:::::. manor of the REVEREND MR. TolleMACHE includes
several districts; but, anxious as he is to do the work of them himself,
it is not fair to call him a pluralist. His mild wish that his brethren
will refrain from trespassing on his ground, assures us that he has no
difficulty in forgiving all his neighbours their trespasses.
THE DISAPPOINTED DIRECTOR.
(A FABLE.)
AN eminent Railway Director, having early business of importance,
Qrdered himself to be called at 6. He was notºitill"; "ifi:
footman said he, was very sorry; he had overslept himself. But he
º he had made every effort to insure his getting up soon
enough.
The Railway Director rang for his hot water. It was lukewarm.
The kettle not been got to boil. However, the housemaid vowed
she had made every effort to insure its boiling.
The Director of Railways sat down to breakfast. He had to wait
five minutes for his egg; and then it was but half done. The egg had
not been thought of till just that moment, and then had to be sent
out for. Nevertheless, the cook had, she declared, made every effort
to insure breakfast betimes.
Having swallowed his coffee, which was filthy, notwithstanding that
the servant had made every effort to insure its goodness, and devoure
heavy roll, to insure whose lightness every effort had been made by
the baker; the .# Director called for his boots, which did not
shine, although every effort had been made to polish them. . He then
took a cab, and arrived at his destination about a quarter of an hour
later than the time that should have been occupied by the journey;
t; º: driver averred stoutly that he had made every effort to get his
orse to go.
A large party of friends and colleagues, including several capitalists
most of whom were great epicures and gluttons, and also dyspeptic and
gouty subjects, whose stomachs and tempers were alike impatient, had
assembled at the house of the Railway Director to dine at 7:30. The
dinner was not announced till 815, albeit Messrs. BUBB and GRUBB
with all the resources of MAGog's Coffee-House at command, had
made every effort to insure punctuality. - -
Hereupon the Railway Director, losing control over his feelings, in-
dignantly demanded what was the meaning of all this? adding, with
an oath, that he supposed the world to be in a conspiracy against him.
To which one of his guests, a little º man, who was wiser than
the rest, replied, “You are quite right; but the reason why the world
conspired against you is, because you and your association conspire
against the world to deceive and defraud it; for you fix certain hours
in your time-tables, thereby engaging to keep them, and, not keeping
them, pretend that you have only contracted to make every effort to
insure punctuality in keeping them. And this is all the reply you have
to make to the complaints of those whom you have choused. And so,
the world has combined to pay you in your own coin, in order that you
may feel how disagreeable it is to haveº: from whom you expect
O
punctuality, not showing it; but inste practising it, putting you
off with the excuse that they have made every effort to insure it.
MORAL.
Railway Cº. are servants of the public; but if the Director
of any Railway Company were to be treated by his own domestics, and
tradesfolk with the same neglect and inattention that he and his fellows
treat the public with, and were to have agreements and bargains made
with himself violated with the like impudence, he would mightily
incensed and exasperated. And, instead of assuaging, it would only
aggravate his wrath to tell him that, every effort had been made to
discharge, those obligations to the fulfilment of which there had been
paid small regard, if any.
OCEAN MELODIES.
(Refined, from the original SEA-Songs, for the use of the Yacht Clubs.)
--
The Wife wishes to go upon the Continent.
ADELINA has flirted-not once, she declares,
Since you ºl. on her finger the ring that she wears;
Since at gloomy ST.GEORGE's your bride she became,
And you gave her an Opera-box marked with her name.
When I sailed in that yacht a whole fortnight with you,
Did I say I was bored (if I did it was true),
With my ALFRED for hours at ecarté. I played,
And his meerschaum I lit, and his coffee I made.
When, the night we’d a box at St. Julli EN’s last bal,
And—goodness knows why—you deserted the salle,
I gave you a smile when you chose to appear,
Nor asked whom you knew on that horrid top tier.
Why won't you, dear AL, by mamma be advised?
A wife who don’t pout, AL, deserves to be prized–
So to Constance and Rome ADELINA you’ll take,
Or a nice piece of work that young person will make.
A NUISANCF,
“MR. PUNCH,-I should be very much obliged if -
stop to a species of annoyance which I am continually, subject to; ...I
allude to a system of ‘Notes and Queries,' which is becoming, daily
more and more impertinently annoying. These questions are put tº me
every morning through the medium of the newspapers, which I am
obliged to read, “just to be in the world.’... I am a poor student,
Sir, and have enough to do to answer questions of a very different
description to the Éiº. viz., “Do you want luxuriant whiskers?.
‘Have you been to − emporium?’ ‘Do you bruise your oats?’
&c. &c. And then if I take a walk, there is, scarcely a street in
which I am not assailed by a pictorial Barmaid ejaculating ‘Sherry,
Sir?’ Do, Mr. Punch, ºw me, through your columns, to answer
these impertinent questions once for all. I have not been and never
will go to — emporium. My AMELIA doesn't care about whiskers,
and therefore I don't; and as for bruising oats, and drinking sherry,
‘this my answer:’—I don't keep horses, and when I want (and Call
pay for) wine I'll ask for it.
| ". would put a
“I am, Mr. Punch, yours &c., FIz.”
“Non Tali Auxilio.”
THE head of the Chinese rebellion is extremely indignant with the
conduct of the Comet who has lately been rushing about his dominions.
He has dispatched a near relation of the Moon's to arrest him in hir
flight, and, wherever he may find him, instantly to cut off his tail.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NEW ZODIACAL LIGHT.
At the recent Meeting of the British Association, PRO-
FEssoR GLIMM, of Finsterberg, favoured Section A with the
outlines of his plan for the better arrangement of the signs
of the zodiac, which, as he truly remarked, were in a very
unsatisfactory state, and not at all in accordance with the
spirit of the age. “What occasion have we,” he asked, “for
ibra, the Balance, when we have already the scales of the
Pisces P” He therefore proposes to remove Libra from its
control over the harvest month, and to substitute for it Virga,
which, as every school-boy knows, is the Latin for a threshing
machine in common use. Aquarius comes under the pro-
visions of the New Cab Act, which declares that no water-
man shall be allowed on the stand, he is to retire on a pension,
and his berth is to be held over for FATHER MATHEw.
The weapons of Sagittarius, and his mode of conducting
the chase, have become quite obsolete, and can only excite
ridicule in an age which has made so many improvements in
fire-arms. He is therefore to share the honourable retire-
ment of Aquarius, and his duties and emoluments are to
be divided amongst a troop of shooting stars. These last
have petitioned that Canis Wenaticus (the hunting dog) may
be allowed to attend them, but their request cannot be com-
plied with until it has been ascertained that this celestial
§: will refrain, from worrying Taurus and Aries, and
arking at the heels of Virgo. PROFEssoR GLIMM has also
persuaded some distinguished members of the Peace Society
to arbitrate between the Gemini, who have not been on
visiting terms for man i. By the intervention of these
gentlemen, it is hoped these discreditable squabbles will be
stopped, and Castor and Pollux will be once more seen in
Company.
OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.—No. 3.
THE º in Paris lives one of two lives; a life of
3uty or a life of pleasure. In the former case he wanders
drearily through the Louvre and the Luxembourg; he makes
painful pilgrimages to churches, museums, and i. 1n
the hope of picking up a knowledge of Art. He devotes this
day to St. Denis, the next to Versailles, the third to St. Cloud.
He fills his catalogue and guide-books with annotations, and
perhaps spends a cheerful evening over a diary, in which des.
perate efforts are made to distinguish the styles of RUBENs
and TITIAN, and the eras of Notre Dame and the Sainte
Chapelle. in the latter case he flºº the Opéra Comique,
the theatres, and the public balls: he breakfasts in the Palais
Royal, and dines at PHILIPPE's, and makes a regular prome-
made in the Champs Elysées every afternoon. The well-
balanced mind of your correspondent seizes the advantages of
both these systems. He devotes his morning to the cultivation
; his intellect, and the 1est of the day to the gratification of
is tastes.
Behold him, then, after a conscientious study of the pic-
tures in the Louvre, prepared to refresh himself by an airing
in the Elysian fields. What a panorama of superb points of
view.l...The Rue de la Paix, the Place and Column Vendôme,
the Attic Madeleine, the endless arcades of the Rue de Rivoli,
the imperial façade of the Tuileries, its classic gardens, the
noble opening of the Place de la Concorde, with its obelisk
and fountains, and the avenue ending with the sublime Arch
of the Star. Where else can such a group of beauties be
found? No wonder the poor Parisians find London dull and
ugly' But, the less we talk about the appearance of our
dingy city the better; we must forget †. Square and
its monuments, and console ourselves with our pavement, our
drainage, and our comfortable firesides.
The sun shines cheerfully, the air is pure, and the philo-
sopher enters the Champs Elysées in a state of serene en-
joyment, proposing to study the manners of the great
nation. e observes an ancient man by the wif in
tattered garments, who plays soft tunes on a bass trom-
ne. No one pays the least attention to this mild min-
strelsy. It is a perfect image of Wisdom talking in the
streets, and no man regarding her. Another poor creature
seated on the ground, grinds a feeble tootling organ amid
similar neglect. The French are evidently not amusical people.
The observer passes on to a temple of Punch, at whose exhi.
bition (in reverence to the august original in England) he is
about to assist, when he is suddenly aroused to a sense of a
cruel disappointment. He might just as well be in Hyde
Park. It is the drive by the Serpentine over again. #.
there’s Over ALLs, of the Blues. There’s Swellings SweLLINGs; you never
can go anywhere without seeing him. That was Bob HILTON, driving the
high-stepping grey horse. There goes THREADPAPER of the Foreign º
with his infant moustache (what the deuce does he want with, a moustache,
should like to know?). There’s old GRATINGs, who is such a bore at the
Club; there’s CHARLEY MARTINGALE of the Plungers, with HQQKER (known
by his friends as the Bravo) in his wonderful tight trousers. But who isn't
here? Two men behind are talking about the Metropolitan, Handicap and
GRUMBLER's chance of the Derby. Really, really, this is too bad. The anciºn;
oet asks, “What exile from his fatherland can leave himself, behind?
he question now is what man, by departure from his º can hope to be
free from his countrymen? It is intolerable. How is it possible to take notes
of Parisian manners when you are seized upon by Sweilings SweLLINGs and
catechised about the prospects of the Haymarket Opera? You get rid of him
by informing him, in confidence, that it has been taken by MR. John BRIGHT
for a series of Bai Masqués and Ballet entertainments, when up, come the
Bravo and MARTINGALE, who want to know when Pytchley's stud is to be
sold. You profess a sulky ignorance of the subject, and ... 5. away, when
MARTINGALE enters upon a sketch of French character, which he holds very low,
chiefly on grounds of a sporting nature. Ever see such dogs?—ever see such
horses?—eversee such riding and driving?—ever see such grooms and coachmen?
You should go to one of their steeple-chases and look at them tºmbling about.
The last time, at La Marche, white and red cap came pounding along fifty
miles an hour, and pulled ap short at the brook to inquire for the bridge.

Hooker endorsed the criticisms of his friend, and called attention to the
cavaliers who pranced up and down the drive. Certainly, it was rather a
ludicrous contrast, both for men and cattle, with our exhibition, in Rotten

tail, and worth about two pound ten each. Qne young fellow, a tremendºus
dandy, galloped up and down on a gray Arab-looking Pº that, an English
gentleman would have put his little boy of twelve upon. The styles of ridin
were various. There were the haute école men, who rode very long and showe
all their saddle in front of them, and the Anglo-maniacs, who rode very .
and showed all their saddle behind them. Some gentlemen seemed dispos
to tie their legs together under their horse's belly; others ºil. them on

A MUSICAL PUMP.
A Composer, whom we cannot do less than call a Musical Pump,
so full is his head of crotchets and water—has published three
watery sheets of music for the Pianoforte, respective y entitled “The
Morning Mist,” “The Rainbow,” and “The Waterfall.” Why should
he stophere? why not thoroughly drain the subject? why not fathom
it in all its depths, until he has not left a º of water that can be
sounded, or out of which any sound can be gºt, by any other composer?
In our liberality, we beg to º: a few subjects for him. -
THE Showgit of RAIN-dedicated to the Lessee of Vauxhall, with
an illuminated frontispiece, showing a view of the “Ten Thousan
additional Lamps,” in water colours. -
THE UMBRELLA GALOP, and PARAsoº PolkA, dedicated to the fair
frequenters of the Horticultural and Botanical Gardens—with a fine
running accompaniment.
THE DELuge—humbly inscribed to Lord MAIDstone.
THE MACKINToshi MARCH-with a view of Chobham Camp—and a
beautiful waterproof wrapper.
The Bucket of WATER—A composition for the milk-pail.
THE OvºRFIow-with a splendid engraving of the Surrey Zoological
Garden; showing the overflow caused by a little Poole. “Exceedingly
playful.”—Musical Review.
HE CATs. AND Dogs' Schottish E, as danced at all the Scottish
Fêtes in Holland Park, Cremorne, &c. .
And when the subject of rain-water is fairly pumped out, there are
all the other atmospheric changes, of which our climate offers such a
tempting variety, and some of which must surely contain a few of the
elements of success. We scarcely know which are the most ridiculous
—the titles that are given now-a-days to new shirts, or the subjects
that are chosen, as the sources of inspiration, by our musical composers.
Extreme Conseientiousness.
THE Field newspaper prides itself in giving “No Reports of Prize
Fights.” So conscientious is the paper in this particular, that it has
announced its determination—in the event of the decimal coinage
being adopted—to turn away every farthing, rather than derive a
profit from a single mil.
CAUSE AND EFFECT-It is said that a cause is always followed by
effect, but this is not the case at all events at law, where a cause is too
frequently followed by “No Effects.”

LINES ON THE BURIAL OF A BRITISH PROTESTANT
IN SPAIN.
Not a knell gave out any funeral note,
As his corpse to the shingles we hurried;
And below water mark we had bareleave got
That our countryman's bones should be buried.
We buried him, dog-like, on that mean site,
The tide on the point of turning,
At the wretched Spaniards' bigot spite
With contempt intensely burning.
No use in coffin enclosing his breast,
Nor in sheet nor in shroud that bound him!
For he lay where he scarce would remain long at rest,
With the ocean washing round him.
None at all were the Fº we read;
And wefelt more of rage than sorrow,
As we thought on the brutes who insult us when dead,
And don't pay us alive what they borrow
We thought as we hollowed his shelly bed,
And smoothed down his pebbly pillow, -
That the crabs and the lobsters would creep o'er his head,
And we with our fleets on the billow !
Lightly they'll talk of our spirit as gone!
r guns might to atoms have brayed them,
Yet we’ve let the rascals in this way gº on,
Treating those very Britons who made them.
But half of our º was done, ...
When the waves roared the hour of retiring,
And we knew we the distance should have to run,
To divert a rabble admiring.
Sharply and quickly we laid him down,
*Mid the jeers of the monks, . and hoary,
And we said, unless Spain is compelled to atone,
All a humbug is Old England's glory!

the other day could boast of two justices besides its own; and many a

rom his habitual contemplation of the summum jus. Equity
draftsmen instead of drawing conveyances have been glad to get con-
veyances to draw them; and the common lawyer has forgotten every
. motion but locomotion, which, at this season of the year, is
almost a motion of course. The diligences nearly all over the
Continent are so unusually loaded, that there is scarcely a vacant
corner to be found in any one of them, but we cannot be surprised that
when so many lawyers are travelling by them they should be rather
heavily charged. .
THE CLOTH AND THE PLUSH.

Curates appear to be little better now: Did ever any one hear of an
ordained valet?—somebody wants to hear of such a servant, however,

The above is taken from the Times. What is the Curate expected to
undertake for £20 a year and his victuals? The cure of Soles—in the
sense of scraping them, perhaps-with the additional duty of polishing
upper leathers. To answer the bell that rings for prayers, peradven-

You are standing on the top of the

see the curl taken out of London in a

perhaps, so grand, so showy and glit-
tering as Mexico, but still it may, in
its new aspect, appear sufficiently
tempting to induce MR. BURFoRD to
select it as the subject of some future
Panorama. , The probability, is, we
should not know it again as the same
city, in which we are now, like sq
many living chimneys, inhaling and
exhaling smoke all day long. The new

London Bridge, would be able to see
them at all events to greater advan-
tage then than he would if he were to

ANOTHER INSULT FROM THE SAXON.
(From “The Nation.”)
ANOTHER insult, hot and hissing, has been flung in the scar-seamed
face of Ireland from the Saxon! And the Crystal Palace—or, rather,
the Vitreous Dungeon for Ireland's liberties—was the appointed scene
of the atrocity. Among the more sublimating objects was the vener-
able form of Q'Connell, (in something harder than wax') surrounded
y a crowd of his own finest peasantry.
: That's O'Connell,” said the QUEEN.
“And . like him,” said PRINCE ALBERT. And with all respect
for his Royal Highness-(for, as we are slaves, we have learned to treat
the Saxon with respect') with all respect we ask, how he should pre-
sume to know it was like the deified, lineaments of the subſime
Liberator?—“And very like him!'” said the Queen's husband; but
—patience is the badge of all our tribe, and we'll let that pass,
But the withering insult is now to be recorded; if it do not, as we
write it, turn our steel pen red-hot, and singe the paper into flames'
The furs or Weijington—the secon
NELL’s “stunted corporal”—yes, Dux Secundus—presumed to “buy
O'Connell, and the peasantry!”
Think of that, oh countrymen! The DUKE of WELLINGTON dared
to put his hand into his pocket, and to take out so much tax-wrung,
Saxon gold, and—counting it piece by piece—he laid it down as the
price o Ó Conseſ."
What did he, mean by that cowardly, atrocious, ready-money trans-
action? º this: by º; O'Connell he intended to fling this
burning libel in the face of Ireland—he wished to show it as his decided
opinion that O'Connel.L could be bought / / /

we hug our chain, it is only to count and pay for the links!

A CLERK PAID IN KIND.
Law is looking up at Manchester—to judge from a paragraph in
the Morning Herald; to wit—
“MANcheates Liberalism.—The following announcement has been posted on the
walls of the Manchester Law Library:—'An experienced clerk, who writes a good
hand, is wanted by a respectable solicitor in Manchester. Salary 7s. per week, with
perquisites in the shape of cast-off clothes. Apply to the librarian.'"
Dull literalism would denounce the º: solicitor who pro-
poses to W. an experienced clerk Fº y in cast-off clothes, as a
screw. Many a plodding fellow will expatiate on the unreasonableness
on the part of a legal gentleman who remunerates a clerk on this scale,
of being astonished that the said clerk should go seedy, or stretch
forth his hand and commit acts contrary to ordinances and statutes in
such case made and provided. It will occur to the stolid mind that
the offer of a stipend of old clothes is not likely to attract any clerk of
experience, beyond that of a Jew salesman. But the true man of
figures, he who understands the language of Fancy, revelling in meta-
or, perceives at once that the proposition which seems so stingy is,
in fact, very liberal. He discerns that by cast-off clothes, is meant a
share in the business, consisting in those suits, which though con-
siderably profitable, are not of sufficient importance to be attended to
# the head of the establishment. It is p'. to find the language
of poetry, thus obtaining, in a profession of which the phraseology has
hitherto been so very unimaginative.
Washing Made Agreeable.
THERE is no washing, after all, like gold-washing. It is the kind of
washing that pays the best, and the only one that a gentleman can,
with credit, put his hands to.

CLASSICALITIES FOR THE NEW COINAGE.
In adopting the decimal coinage, it would be desirable to
alter as little as possible the existing momenclature of the
§º cash. The idea of the decimal may be expressed by
the slightest variation of a term, in vernacular use to denote
a certain piece of money. By the change of a letter in the
word “Tanner,” the sixpence might, º be retained
to the great bulk of the people; whilst, by the conversion
alluded to, namely, into “Tenner,” the new elements of its
constitution, would be at the same time signified. The novel
word “Mil,” should be rejected; and for it might be substi:
tuted the similarly sounding but more familiar name of “Bill,”
the adoption of which may be recommended on the ground
of analogy, as the shilling has been already long stamped with
the popular diminutive of Bob.” If the somewhat fanciful
expression." Mil,” or “Mill,” is employed, the principle of
its derivation should be consistently carried out. The words
“Winder,” “Bender,” “Twister,” “Topper,” and “Stunner.”
might be borrowed to designate, money, which itself should
change its present correct, appellation for the more sportive
and appropriate title of Blunt. The mutation of “Florin.”
into “Floorer” would be obviously called for, and the crown
iece might beneatly styled a “Punisher,” as being the well-
own amount of the fine for inebriety.
On all the coins emanating from the º mint, it
would be requisite that the flion and the timicom should be
fighting; and whilst W. R. figured on one side of them, P. R.
should be stamped on the other, that it might in every respect
be characterised by the true ring.
PUNCH*S POTATO PROPHECY.
The reader, who minds his Punch, of course remembers
what Punch prophesied in 1847 on the Irish potato rot. From
that very decay, Punch predicted regeneration:
“The butcher, the baker,
The candle-stick maker,
All jumped out of a rotten potato.”
So runs the childish doggrel; but Punch heard in that sham-
bling verse a musical promise; , and, hearing, foretold the
coming time when, from the very blight that smote the people
of Ireland º Ireland's potatos, there should be peace
and plenty for Ireland regenerate. And is it not so?_Answer
with one of your wildest roars, oh, Lion of Judah! Is it not
so-reply and tenderly, cooingly, oh Dove of Galway !
WAs a smarter old feller than I be e'er seen
In these bright brass, buttons—this new quoat of green *
Why is it I’m rigged out so fine as this here?
Why for sarvin' one master for full thirty year.
But wherefore should I be so proud o' my clothes,
And strut in 'em so, stickin' up my old nose *
Do I think the prize-suit such an honour to wear?
Shoo! it baint for the raiment alone as I care.
'Tisn't that—the mere valley and worth of the coat—
'Tis the honour the present is meant to denote,
The respect I be held in, the height of esteem,
Which is far above all I could possible dream.
Why, what dost thee think, man?, these things is no less
Than a passpoort for wearers, a privileged dress,

And they lets me walk into the grand County Ball.

“He’s a noble, is John, though he isn't a Peer,
Iwun't say as how he’s the noblest that’s here;
But an honest man John is, and all on you know,
In course, what the poet calls him as is so.
DISRAELI'S COAT AND BADGE.
“Look at this horny palm how became it like that,
So that on it he uses to slice bacon fat?
Why by thirty years' toil—and for whom, d'ye suppose?

“But for dancin’” I sez, “I’m afeard I’m too old.”
“Oh! we won't º the Poker, nor Walsa dew Tong,

On cake, chicken, lobster, sweets, aught I could find,
The fust time I ever ate all I’d a mind.

And consider the quoat but a badge o' disgrace.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IRON BARS OF MUSIC.
We have often wished that we could suggest anything that would
afford some scope for the unemployed ability of the artists of our
almost extinct English Opera. Here, in an advertisement out of the
Times, appears to be something like an º: for one of them—if the
º predilections of our superior classes have not starved them
all :
RGAN.—WANTED, a respectable man to act as TURNKEY in a
County Prison. One who understands music, can play the Organ, and sing bass
E. be prefered. For further particulars apply, post paid, to T. T. S., Post-office,
athl.
The popular air of “Still so gently o'er me stealing,” will imme:
diately suggest itself as one of the first airs that would be called
for from the musical turnkey, having been transposed so as to be sung
in the bass, which “would be preferred.” Any one who had personated
the gaoler in the vernacular version of Fidelio would, however, be the
man for the situation; and it is pleasing to imagine such a respectable
vocalist leading the Prison Chorus at the head of real convicts. A
§ idea, too, is that of a Nightingale, within four stone walls,
eguiling the tedium of confinement with his “jug jug.” Of course
the harmonious turnkey would enchant his incarcerated audience by
his performance of the Witch music of MATTHEw Locke. That he
should also be an organist is a good notion; phrenologists will admit
it to be judicious to Pº the organ of tune against that of acquisi-
tiveness or theft, and all other human organs out of tune and dis-
cordant with man's better nature. Talking of the organ, SEBASTIAN
Bach would have been just the very turnkey in request, for he was a
master of that noble instrument; and the kind of piece which he most
delighted in performing thereon was a Quod-libet.
It is to be hoped that the cultivation of music will be introduced at
Newgate; and then, perhaps, we shall at last witness a genuine repre-
sentation of the Beggar's Opera.
OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.—No. 4.
HEN, Sir, you selected me
frºm the crowd of emi-
ment persons who soli-
cited the honour of fur-
nishing you with their
impressions of the
French metropolis, you
were good enough to
attribute to me, an un:
connnnon impartiality and
serenity of mind. “That
impartiality,” you ob-
served with your usual
force and felicity of lan-
guage, “will preserve
our communications
#. the onesidedness
that usually, deforms a
traveller's views, of a
foreign country.” M
modesty, Sir, (almost
amounting to bashful-
ness) is well known to
ou, but I will venture
o say that you, were
correct in your estimate.
I feel myself equally free
from the sturdy, prepos-
sessions nourished by
MR. Dowlas of Meck-
lenburgh Square and the rose-coloured, delusions, which captivate||
young ThreadPAPER of the Foreign Office. The former gentleman
marches through this city in company with MRs. D., and the girls,
armed with a guide-book and a pocket map, and finds all, barren; The iſ
latter wishes to introduce absolute government into England, sup:
ported by an army of five hundred thousand men and a censorship of
the press. THREAppAPER is of tender ſº ; his moustache is downy,
indeed hardly visible without a he will grown wiser with time,
lass;
but MR. Dowlas, I very much É. is beyond all cure.
D., you old humbug' what do you mean by uttering your 'shallow
vulgar criticism on the greatest nation of Continental Europe? You
know nothing of their history, except that they were beaten at the
battle of Waterloo; you can't speak a word of their language; you
can't read one of their newspapers; you are supremely ignorant of
their character and institutions, and yet you treat them as a mob of
hairdressers, dancing masters, and cooks (and not good cooks either),
and exult in the time-honoured conviction that one Englishman can
thrash two Frenchmen. Dowlas, attend to me, I am going to talk
about taste—a word that ought to excite shame and anguish in your
mind. For a quarter of a century, you have been smothering, the
world with printed fabrics of fantastic and horrible ugliness. Millions
upon millions of yards of these abominations have found their way
into every nook and corner of the world. Remote tribes of wandering
Tartars and the squaws of painted Choktaws have clad their bodies
and depraved their souls with your outrageous patterns. Bales
marked with the well-known D. Č. how could you, MR. Dowl.As,
Sir P) have carried their baleful influence into the innocent populations
of the Peaceful Ocean. The least hideous of these productions are
those you have stolen (and spoiled) from the French, and if there is
any improvement in your patterns of late years, it is entirely to be
attributed to your piracy of French designs.
The fact is, that France has become the Mistress of Arts to the
world. If England lives in a fever of industry, she lives in a fever of
invention. Every ". we have is due to her restless creative spirit.
In arts, in letters, in philosophy, she scatters abroad new ideas with
unsparing profusion; other nations, following with unequal steps,
treasure up what falls, and claim it as their own. This exuberance of
fancy is only the result of the universal artistic feeling which seems to
animate her citizens, You cannot go anywhere in Paris without
being conscious of this. Every shop window is a picture. Look at
that pastrycook's. A few pieces of china and half-a-dozen bon-bon
boxes form a composition that is really charming. Is there any one
from Marlborough House could do it as well ? Only think of the tons
of three commercătarts and Bath buns that form {{. decoration of a
London confectioner's. And yet this pretty arrangement is due to the
intuitive taste of the little scrubby ignorant daughter of the people
who serves in the shop. 1 will not draw your attention to the quiet
becoming style of her dress, because you have often confessed to me
in private your admiration of Parisian toilettes, though in the presence
of MRs. D. you loudly affect to prefer the dowdy manner adopted b
that lady in common with the most part of her countrywomen. I º
therefore, make no further mention of ladies' costume, only protesting
that, in my opinion, all Frenchwomen in their degree dress to perfec-
tion, and that an ugly bonnet is no certain proof of wisdom or
goodness as is generally supposed.
Turn to the houses, and compare their *. ornate appearance with
the dismal monotonous streets of London. Every one has its separate
character: , The portal is of sculptured stone, always decent and often
of beautiful design. A little bit of carved cornice, a simple moulding
round the windows gives individuality and interest to the upper part
without any of the astounding architectural eccentricities of Regent
Street. Enter, and you will find the furniture of even the humbler
occupants varied, characteristic, and pretty. Where ornament is
attempted, it is well, chosen and sparingly introduced. A beautiful
cabinet, a few small pictures, a group or two in bronze, some
exquisite china-quite a contrast to the overwhelming magnificence of
English upholstery. I know, Dowlas, you gave a carte blanche to
JoBKINs and SoN for your house in Mºirá Square. Well
well—if the subject, is a painful one we will not pursue it; though f
must say that I think six copies of the y young woman in
fetters, called for some inscrutable reason the Greek §. rather too
much for two drawing-rooms (couldn't you send up a pair to the best
bed-room, and one to the butler's pantry?) and I may also take this
opportunity of informing Job KINS, JUNior, who does the “tasty”
Y|business of his firm, that merely º º tables and
o
chairs, and daubing, everything over with gold, though it may satis-
factorily swell the bill, shows a miserable want of fancy and cleverness
in a decorator.
I quite admit the solidity and, conscientiousness of English work:
manship. We buy a frightful table in Bond Street, and, behold, it will
last for ever. The drawers in Dowlas's house are as delightful to
open and shut as they are horrible to look at. English boots will
outlast French boots, and English gloves French gloves. Whatever
may have been the case years ago, it is a great mistake to suppose that
these articles are better now in Paris than in London. The great
ifference is shortly this"—our artists are tradesmen and their tradesmen
are artists. In all articles of . usefulness we have an unquestion-
able superiority, but where something more than convenience or dura:
ity is required our designers seem quite helpless. A certain funeral
car will occur to º as an example of this truth, and, perhaps, by
malicious persons, will be taken to shew how much or how little is
to be expected from Government Schools of Art.
The Tourist is aware that, no one can walk about Paris without
seeing abundant, evidences of the coarsest moral and social feeling
and claims an infinitely higher position for his own countrymen and
countrywomen in this respect. He also recollects that he has already
ridiculed the dress of Frenchmen, and sees that this may be supposed
inconsistent with a sweeping panegyric on French taste. But this is
* This is not intended to apply to our painters, who
may well be compared with those
of any country, but to the designers for manufactures.

an exception that proves the rule. A Frenchman's theory of dress is
He always wants to be conspicuous and picturesque. Hence
nothing is too singular and sho him. He gets himself up, as
for the stage, with velvet and fur and beard and moustache, and
exhausts the resources of his inventive mind for new and still more
piquant combinations. When he turns his attention to the chase,
the result is something worth seeing, and no mistake, as will be more
plainly seen by a picture of a party of sporting gentlemen, going out
shooting. But these comicalities are eschewed by the genuine
“swells,” who adopt our sober English motions of masculine costume,
and, indeed, dress exactly like Englishmen. The advice of Polonius
to Laertes will literally apply to the matter at the present day:-
“Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not ea pressed in fancy—rich, not gaudy—
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are most select and generous, chief in that—”
The most august confirmation has been given to this view. I state
with becoming reverence and awe that his I–L M-y, with that
regard for detail which characterises his great mind, has sent a special
envoy to London, and had all his liveries made in Saville. Row, with
whic unspeakably solemn allusion I close this communication.

SPIRITED CONDUCT OF A PUBLIC COMPANY.
THE Greenwich Steamboats have recently been employed in the
important, but somewhat dangerous, service of destroying the various
piers, at which they call for passengers. These absurd and useless
structures—which are usually composed of three or four superannuated
barges, loosely connected by a twopenny cord; several flights of stairs,
leading up into the air and down again, on to the next pier and back
again, or, indeed, anywhere but into the boats; a hut which com-
bines the accommodation of a watch-box with the cleanliness of a
pigstye, and a series of gangways which are intended to accommodate
themselves to the rising and ºf of the tide, but which invariably
stick fast at the wrong end, and either carry the unfortunate traveller
some 20 feet above, the wharf, or threaten to precipitate him down a
sort of Montagne Russe into the water;-these agglomerations of tar
dirt, touchwood, and rope-yarn, have so long encumbered and disfigured
the bank of the river that the Directors of the Greenwich steamboats
º come to the resolution which their boats have been carrying
out.
The plan, on which the work of demolition is carried on, is as
follows: The captain drives the boat stem on to the pier, without
giving any order to reverse the engines, and the immediate consequence
is a most satisfactory collision. It is not true, however, that the
French, in despair at ever being able to effect a landing in London
over these piers, have bribed the Directors to destroy these bulwarks
of the river. Nor are the Directors following the example of the Scotch
Baronet, who has just pulled down a pier on his estate, because the
boats, stopped at it on Sunday. The cases are quite different, for the
Scotch piers are only private, or representative, and can be removed at
pleasure, whereas the London piers have persevered in their career of
uselessness formany ages, and can only begotridofby violent measures.

In the land that lies beneath our feet, on t'other side of the sun.
And no more masses to pay for!-good day to ye, FATHER O' BLADP,

As the prophet sex, ye purgeour dross, and take precious care of the tin.
Ye’ve a bandage on yer wrist, MoLLY; that wrist with gems I'll deck,

And we’ll live in a snug retirement where our nearest neighbour’ll be
The EMPEROR or CHINA, who will sometimes look in to tea!

For even the pigs and potatoes are not the angels that once they were;

i. For Haven's sake, gentlemen, don't mail the poor man's ears to

Such was the benevolent exclamation of TYGER Roche (an Irish
fire-eatºr of the last century) when he beheld a certain attorney within
the walls of lublin Jail., And the prayer was sufficient; for no sooner
was it uttered, than the hapless lawyer was in the clutches of invoked
persecutors, and hammer and nails hotly sought for. -
Our friend the Spectator, oddly enough, is, for once, very like TYGER
Roche. He says–
“It is evident that a serious disturbance in Turope might be very inconvenient to
the minor German Powers; and that fact has perhaps suggested the rough guess, that
a Prince bound up with German interests by family relations, has used his position
near the British Sovereign for the purpose of inducing England to assist in hushing
up the quarrel, with scanty regard to the justice of the case; in short, that PRINCE
Albent has induced England to abandon her pledge and her ally!"
The Spectator having made “the rough guess,” reasons on it in his
own logical way, and concludes with these convincing words—
“We do not believe that PRINCE ALBERT has so far forgotten his happy and exalted
duty, of which he has shown so just an appreciation, by officious meddling with affairs
which are not his."
That the Spectator, the Esquimaux of the Press—for somehow he
always appears to Punch in a suit of sealskin, with a very blue nose,
; if necessary, to harpoon the whale that shall supply his mid-
night oil—that the cold Spectator should suggest such a charge against
PRINCE ALBERT merely to express a disbelief is, at least, a very
unnecessary trouble.
“Don’t nail the poor man's ears to the pump!' cries TygłR Roche.
“Don’t believe PRINCE ALBERT an ally of Nicholas!” cries the
Spectator.

SONG OF THE TRANSPLANTED SHAMROCK.
“One of the Royal servants brought with him to the train a sod of shamrock which
had been dug up in the grounds attached to the Viceregal, Lodge. A porcelainH:
received the plant, which, as it had been obtained at the special request of Her:
Majesty, is probably destined to be transplanted to some of the Royal grounds, and
cultivated as a memento of a visit which will be long memorable in Ireland."-
Publin Daily Express.
ERIN mavourneen, torn up from thy green
Lonely, withered, and drooped for a while,
Though planted in porcelain, and nursed by a Queen,
I was sick at the roots for my own pleasant isle;
Where the winds came so gently to kiss me and love me,
There was tenderness e'en in the breath of the north;
Where the kind clouds would fling their soft shadows above me,
When the hot sun of summer came scorchingly forth.
I pined for those tender #. eyes, whose black lashes
R. a tear and a smile alike ready to start;
I longed for the mirth, whose unquenchable flashes
iíðida struggle with gloom in the Irishman's heart.
White hands were about me, but not my own #.
Kind hearts, too, but not the kind hearts I had known;
The bells that I heard rang in Sassenach steeples,
And wanted the music I loved in my own.
An' I fancied they scorned me, the poor plant of Erin,
Them roses so gaudy, them thistles so tall;
An' I thought as they tossed their proud heads, it was sneerin'
At my poor lowly leaflets, wid no flower at all.
But by little and little 1 felt that about me
The soil gathered cheery, and kindly, and warm;
And the illigant flowers that I thought meant to flout me
When I larnt what they said, sure they meant me no harm.
The hands I thought cold I found true in their tending,
The hearts I thought hard, sure, were soft at the core;
So I º my leaves with less fear of offending,
And the longer I knew I loved England the more.
For my Queen is a mistress that’s gentle and tender,
And oft my poor leaflet her bosom adorns;
Bhe says I’ve my sweetness, if roses their splendour,
An' if I’ve no blossoms, why, sure I’ve no thorns.

THE INSTITUTION OF OUR SPECTRE OF

.THE following “Pastoral” has been published by an obscure indi.
vidual, who pretends to adopt a certain episcopal style.

the Neighbourhood, Health and Good }; i.
. and Intelligent, From the º of GILEs SCROG-
GINs of tuneful memory, to that of the Head of the Woolly Quadruped
which manifested itself to WILLIAM WHITE, there was no want of
Špºral *. sufficient to convince the enlightened British
Public of the existence of Ghosts. Not to mention the unfortunate
Miss. BAILEy, who, after suspension by the cincture of her own
stocking, revisited an unprincipled CAPTAIN SMITH, nor to say more
than is neces of the Ghost of Cock Lane, it may suffice to cite the
instance of the Hammersmith Ghost which, as is well known, appeared
to, and terrified a great many people. And now lately, in this ye
#. is not far from that, there has appeared a Ghost, whic
. §ened multitudes; as countless thousands among you are able
O testify.
But #. incredulous—insensible to the force of table rappings, dis;
believing thed. es of clairvoyance, and, deriding the wonderful
visions of the Crystal—who, in short, ascribe all the supernatural events
of the day, which are very numerous, to imagination or fraud, will
doubtless, after a short time, by the lapse whereof the recollection of
the fact shall have been weakened, dispute or deny the truth of the
Chelsea Ghost, and attribute the authentic narrative thereof to the
incredible WALKER. -
Lest, therefore, the memory of this so wonderful Apparition should
perish, and in order that, on the contrary, its fame may endure for
ages, we have decreed to erect a Spirituous Establishment, in the
immediate vicinity of the house wherein it took place, namely, in Pond
Street, Chelsea, to be called and known by the name and sign of the
Ghost and Goblet, which all are invited to frequent, and partake of the
refreshment of spirits. - -
Beneath the edifice to be reared under these auspices, there will be
rovided a subteranean retreat, bearing the name of The Shades, in
}. allusion to the miracle which it is intended to commemorate.
A confraternity of the Ghost and Goblet has already been formed for
the º of celebrating with an *ś. banquet the ;
Festival of Michaelmas. Additional Members may be enrolled at 6d.
per week each.
The following indulgences are promised to those who repair to the

on condition of eating with the goose an optional quantity of mashed

iqueurs—to any extent, on condition of º the bell, or calling the
waiter, and repeating the proper order for the liquor as often as may
be requisite.
Indulgence in tea and shrimps. - -
Indulgence in tobacco for any term of hours; the hostelry remaining
open.

In Your Own Jugs, BRUMMAGEM BROMPton.
Two of the most Extraordinary Occurrences of the Day-The Appearances at Salette and Chelsea.
NEUTRALITY IN PLUSH.
The wonders of steam at Manchester and other great manufacturing
towns are Tº eclipsed by the triumph at which mechanical science
has arrived in an obscure locality. Witness this advertisement,
extracted from the Cambridge Chronicle of the 10th instant:
WANTEP in a Clergyman's family in the country, a FOOTMAN, which
must also have a knowledge of Gardening. For particulars address X. Y., Post
Oſfice, Caxton.
The Footman which is wanted in a Clergyman's family, is, of course,
a Machine; as the neuter pronoun, by the tenet of Murth AY, held of
course by every clergyman, is to be applied to animals and inanimate
things; and no known animal is §: of a Footman's place. The
Footman thus wanted might have been supposed to be a trivet, but
for the requisition that it shall have a knowledge of gardening. This
proves that it must be an Engine—and in part a Garden Engine-
endowed with intellectual faculties. That it is advertised for is suf-
ficient evidence that it exists.
Necessity is the mother of invention; and the dearth of labour, com-
bined with the insolence, unthriſt, and dishonesty of servants, has
compelled some clever mechanist to devise the sort of Footman which
is wanted by the clergyman; and has been long in general request.
How such a domestic could have been constructed; how it was
possible to make a lackey that should not only clean boots and wait
at table, but dig, and prune, and plant, and exercise intelligence, more-
over, in these horticultural operations, it is difficult to conceive.
Imagination staggers at the idea of a Steam Flunkey. The MR. SMEF,
who resolves thought into electrical action, may suppose that galvan:
ism might have served to vivify the apparatus, and cause the fibres of
its artificial brain to quiver with those vibrations which constitute
perception, memory, and understanding. But if mind consists in
vibrations, the abilities of a Shakspere are no great shakes; there-
fore we cannot accept such a theory of the constitution of the Footman
which is wanted in a Clergyman's family.
The mysterious agency concerned in Table Turning, belief in which
has in some minds survived its refutation by FARADAY, we should
rather consider to be the animating principle of this FRANKENSTEIN's
Aº or ANDREwondes, artificial ANDREw or automatic John
HOMAS.
The female domestics in the family of the clergyman are, of course,
of a nature similar to that of the manservant which is wanted there,
since no housemaid or cook could stay in a house where a Footman
was kept referred to by the neuter pronoun, which, and consequently
where the Footman was an Inanimate Thing.
A Fable for Mr. Commissioner Murphy.
ONCE upon a time, a lot of murphies—id est potatoes—were put in
a pot together. “Now, boys.”—said one of the praties—"as we'll all
be in hot water—all of a bilin’—wobble as we may, for the credit of
ould Ireland—don't let us split on one another.”
The Main Stays of Science.
THE savans at Hull, have lately been giving some very interesting
results of the trial of the strength of “stays.” Surely this department
should have been left to a female committee, for the true strength of
“stays” can only be ascertained by experiments in very tight lacing.
A NEW TIDE OF EMIGRATION.
GoLD has been discovered in Scotland. This discovery, may work
perhaps a miracle. It may have the effect of sending all the toh-
men, who for years have left their native country, “bock again.”

ENTERPRISE.
N opulent Bill-sticker

offers to the leader of the
Chinese insurgent forces
to rent of him, in the
event of his being made
Emperor, the renowned
waiſofthima. The sum
offered has not trans-

e something extremel
munificent. f is the bill-
sticker's intention, as
soon as he obtains anim-
perial grant, to form a
company of persons who
spend large sums of
money every year in ad-
vertisements, an to
cover the entire, length
of the wall with their
bills and posters, alarger
price being, of course,
charged for those which
will be posted inside
than for those outside
the wall, where º:
tively but few people will be able to see them. The bills will be in English, or
specially translated into Chinese, at the option of the advertisers. In the event
of China being thrown open to English commerce—and there is, at, present, every
opening of such a fact—it will be at once seen what “a desirable medium for
...” this national posting-station will be. So favourably is the scheme
entertained by some of our leading advertisers, that already have 12,000 miles of
that part of the wall, which runs through the most densely populated districts
of the Empire, been bespoken at an enormous rental. . The cºmpany will be
announced in a few days, and it is expected that the shares will be quoted, on
the 'Change at a heavy premium the very first day. . BERNAL Osborne

actively on the look-out. PROFEssoR LIEBIG's testimonial in favour of Bitter Beer

DEAR ENTERTAINMENT FOR DEAR CREATURES.
“My DEAR PUNCH,
“There is no doubt that the prodigious expenses of hotels are—as I over-
heard certain gentlemen say—in a great measure owing to us confounded women.
We cause so . rooms to have to be kept up on our account. Why can't we-
as they further asked, with a stronger expression—be content with a decent coffee-
room, instead of requiring a separate sitting apartment? Why? I asked myself
the same question, and being unable to answer it, I thought the next time I was
out with Charles'ſ would go into the coffee-room and not be confounded. So the
other day when he took me to one of those inns which a letter I read in the Times
calls a “Hotel of recreation,” I insisted on our dining in the public room. There
were some gentlemen sitting there that we have since met in society, when the
behaved in such a way that I couldn't think what they meant, until at last...I foun
that we were looked upon as *Wºº eople because I had been seen at dinner in
the coffee-room of a tavern! When 1 discovered this I felt confounded indeed.
It seems that I have committed an offence against society, everybody is so cool to
me, and really, if it were not for the contempt I feel for such slaves of custom
and prejudice, and the support I derive from the knowledge that I have pleased
my husband, and saved us both money, I should be dreadfully grieved. But his
approbation, and that of my own conscience, are quite enough for me; however, as
that is not quite the case, I am afraid, with all women, the consequence is that the
won't brave the world, and go in the coffee-room. I must confess, Mr. Punch,
that before we take all the credit for what is called in novels the 'Self Sacrifice
of Woman’ which is given us, we might as well immolate a little of our conven-
tionality on the altar of domestic happiness. I am sure that JUDY is of the same
mind as your equally constant admirer,

We are glad to see that the needlewomen have at last struck, and we wish

year; but the case is very different with the curate who has only twenty pounds.
RING CHOLERA'S PROCESSION.
FROM Russian steppe, from Persian sand,
From pine-fringed Norway fiord,
From Elbe's and Eyder's peopled strand
I’ve skimmed the sea—lºve swept the land—
Way for your lord!
Come deck my board—prepare my bed,
And let the trump of doom
Peal out a march, that as I tread
Above the dying and the dead
All may make room!
From far I snuff the odour sweet
That I do love the best;
And wheresoe’er I set my feet,
Courtiers and liegemen flock to greet
Their King confest.
Wellhave you done your loyal part,
My subjects and my slaves—
In town and country, port and mart,
All’s ready-after my own heart—
All—to the graves!
What is my feast?. These babes ſorpined;—
Men ere their prime made old;—
These sots, with strong drink bleared and blind-
These herds of unsexed woman kind
Foul-mouthed and bold-
These bodies, stunted, shriyelled, seared
With the malaria's breath;
In foetid dens and workshops reared;
From reeking sewers, drains uncleared,
Drinking in death.
What is my court? These cellars piled
With filth of many a year-
These rooms with rotting damps defiled—
These alleys where the sun ne'er smiled,
Darkling and drear !
These streets along the river's bank,
Below the rise of tide;
These hovels, set in stifling rank,
Sapped by the earth-damps green and dank-
These cess-pools wide.
These yards, whose heaps of dust and bone
Breathe poison all around;
These styes, whose swinish tenants grown
Half human, with their masters own
A common ground.
What are my perfumes? Stink and stench
From slaughter-house and sewer;
The oozing gas from opened trench,
The effluvia of the pools that drench
Court-yards impure.
What is my music? Hard-wrung groans
From strong men stricken down;
Women's and children's feebler moans,
And the slow death-bell's muffled tones
In every town.
Who are my lieges? Those that rule
In Nº. and at Board;
The Town-hall's glib and giddy fool,
The mob's most abject slave and tool,
Though called its lord.
He who with prate of Wested Rights
Old forms of wrong defends;
Who for pound-foolishness still fights,
Wisdom, save penny-wisdom, slights;-
These are my friends.
The Industrious Cossacks.
We don’t wonder that some of our Manchester friends
should be content to see the Russian forces holding the
lities. Those who object to the idleness of a mili-
Princi -
tary life must naturally admire an army of occupation.

We felt quitºsure that directly the police went in search of the appa-
rition, it would not appear to any summons that might be served i.
it; and when we were told that SERGEANT SoMEBody had walked
through the ghost, we were convinced the real fact must have been
that if there was a ghost at all, the police, instead of walking through
it, would have walked into it. We felt perfectly satisfied that the
spectre must vanish before the i. and we are happy, for the
sake of common sense, to find publicity given to the fact, that the
Chelsea Ghost lives only in the imagination of the unhappy, paragraph-

of realising an extra glass of grog or some “other compound.”

OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.—No. 5.
NITH that spirit of zealous
self-sacrifice which be-
comes his office, your Cor-
respondent has visited
the great masqued ball
at the Opera, that ter-
minates the festivities
of the Carnival. He
was accompanied by
the rising diplomatist
GE o R G E E R N E st
CIARENCE PROTOCOL,
whose filmy whitechoker,
pink shirt, opal studs,
and shining boots were
truly an honour to his
country. At one o'clock
his Brougham whirled
us rapidly to the theatre.
The streets were alive
with people. A masqued
ball is a fête for those
who can't go as well
as for those who can.
Riotous groups in cos-
tume were exchanging
badinage with the crowd
and each other as they
converged to the great
point of attraction. Flar:
ing gas-lights illuminated
the street down which
we turned out of the
Boulevard, and showed to
advantage two bearded
and cloaked warriors on
horseback, who looked
as if they might be part
of the entertainment.

on Saturday night; more
F. ue mounted swordsmen—the Brougham pulls up, and we alight amid the respectful ‘.
ations of the officials. We mount the stairs in company of masks, dominoes, and persons in ordinary
evening dress, and pass into the Salle.
The effect is bewildering, overwhelming. The theatre is open to the uttermost back wall, and, even
so, barely holds the multitude of dancers. The orchestra is probably the noisiest in the world, but
is nothing to the astounding din of the people. No words can describe the combination of the two.
As for the spectacle, several thousand lunatics, in the violent sº capering and gesticulating under a
strong paroxysm of their malady, will present a faint picture of it. The madmen are all costumed,
and resent the appearance of a black coat in their terrific orgies. Probably it reminds them of the
medical gentlemen from whom they have escaped. There is a sprinkling of Greeks, knights, nobles|Y
of Louis, the THIRTEENTH, shepherdesses, court ladies, and so forth; but the prevalent costume of
the men is the white and red of a Pierrot; of the ladies, the chemise and trowsers of a débardeur.
It is this division that makes the most clamour and has the greatest enjoyment of the fun. . Groups
of the white figures with floured faces, tall hats, and streaming ribbons ſoll in the boxes, and hold, a
“chaffing” conversation with those below, which may be witty, but, at all events, is deafening. The
young ladies in the embroidered shirts, satin pantaloons, and trim hats, beneath which their hair
descends in long plaited tails, contribute at least their fair share to the uproar. But, besides, there are
other characters not so intelligible. One grotesque shape is composed entirely of seaweed, or what
looks like it; another is in rags, with carrots and turnips on his head; a third sports a chimney pot
as a head dress; a fourth is surmounted by a weathercock. There is no limit to the fantastic com;
binations thus arrived at, which are generally more odd than pleasant; and any enterprising individual
who should make his appearance in a very dirty shirt, a crownless hat, and a pair of pumps would,
probably, make rather a hit than otherwise.
It must be confessed, aſter the first half-hour, when the eye is more accustomed to the scene, and
the ear has begun to discriminate between the various noises, the refined taste of your Correspondent
(used to the assemblies of Monsieur Julliºn) was very much outraged. The orchestra is, simply
infamous, nothing being audible but ºf brass and the jangling cymbal; the house is foully dirty
and badly lighted. The º is shabbily dressed, and, apparently, includes many of the lowest
ruffians of Paris. On the other hand, there is immense enjoyment and fun, and the dancing made
even your travelling sage open the eyes of astonishment.
The police, of course, are everywhere, and at the ordinary public balls interfere to moderate the
antics of the dancers. But at the masqued balls they let things tº. their course; and the consequence
is, that each lady and ſº to the best of her or his ability, indulges in those variations on the
quadrille which are collectively objectionable. They are, in musical phrase, perfectly ad libitum, and
#. scope for an exercise of fancy and agility, which would produce rather a sensation at ALMACKs.
here was one couple, MoRoK the #. Tamer in red and hessians, and a débardeur in §. trowsers
and a powdered peruke, who really were astounding. MoRok ended by carrying, off his friend on his
shoulders, to the great delight of a fat Pompier, who stood by in a bright brass helmet, exactly like a
small coalscuttle. -

More flaring, gas-lights,
is the resort of all the “swells.” Of
course the blond children of Albion
muster strongly, and, indeed, rather
eclipse the native gentlemen with their
severe hauteur and stately presence.
Some of the ladies are in ball dresses,
and hang on the arm of cavaliers; the
i. are in that mysterious enve-
lope which recals AUBER's charming
comic opera, and employ themselves
in puzzling, or, as they say, “in-
triguing,” whatever acquaintances
they recognise. PROTOCOL is imme-
diately attacked by a tall, black do-
mino, whose eyes sparkle with a lustre
no mask can hide. She whispers some-
thing in his ear which heightens his
colour, and is gone before he can de-
mand an explanation. Now, by the
shades of RADCLIFFE and SiR WAL.
TER, there is romance in the nine-
teenth century! PROTocol, you must
practise the guitar and learn a collec.
tion of serenades “arranged to suit a
voice of moderate compass.” “My
dear fellow,” replied the diplomatist,
“I thought no one in the world knew

she's lovely) told me. Just fancy if
she should turn out to be as noble
and rich as she is beautiful. Hey?’.

little consommé with poached *f; aflet aur champignons, and a salad
with a bottle of Cham e. PRotocol’s acquaintance, it appears,
was the blanchisseuse of the Embassy, an exceedingly respectable per-
son of fifty. The rising diplomatist seemed rather sore on the subject
of Le Domino Noir, which became the principal topic of conversation in
consequence. Of course, the secret she told him must have been about
his washing-bill.
The present opinion of the Sage is, that pleasure, and indeed thin
in general, are vanity. , Bals masqués are noisy, dusty, and dull...People
ought not to pay, but be paid, for going to them. Monastic institutions
have charms for a well-constituted mind. Literary pursuits are
laborious and not sufficiently remunerated. When Champagne is not
good, it has disagreeable effects on your health the next day. Bring
me some Cognac and Eau de Seltz. Oh dear, I wish I had cut the
supper.
FRENCEL TIES AND DYNAS-TIES.
The Grand Opéra at Paris, has just re-opened, after a perfect
restºration” made by order of the EMPERoR, who is more favourable
tº a “restoration” in affairs of the drama than in affairs of politics.
The theatre has been gorgeously re-decorated and overlaid with a pro-
fusion of gold, which stands out in all the boldefrontery of gilt beneath
the blaze of a thousand gaslights. Even the members of the orchestra
are elaborately got up, and though not absolutely bound hand and foot
at the will of the EMPERoR, they are literally taken by the throat, for
they are compelled to appear in white neckcloths. Every instrumental
performer must become a member of the stiff-necked fraternity if he
wishes to be engaged at the Grand Opéra; and it, matters little what
may be his reputation, or how illustrious may be the stock to which he
belongs, if he refuses to bind himself to the tie prescribed by the
French Government. Such is the pliancy with which all classes now
bow their necks to the ruling power, that we have not heard of one
instance in which the .."application of the starched cravat has
roused any artist's choler. It is, however, feared that in a very heavy
and fatiguing opera, the time of some of the pieces will have to be
changed, in order that the orchestra may get a few bars' rest to
adjust their neck-ties, which some of the tremendous crescendo move-
ments of MEYERBEER will be likely to derange. We tremble to think
of the consequences of the “Blessing of the Poignards” on the cravats
of the poor fiddlers.
Second Thoughts.
It was intended to inaugurate a statue of Louis NApoleon at
Lille, bearing the inscription—“To the Protector of Native Sugar.”
It was, however, abandoned for re-consideration. It will probabº be
amended as follows, and the statue inaugurated on the 2nd of
December—“To the Protector of Native Sugar—ºf lead.”
A Joke that must be Felt if it can't be Seem.
WE perceive that all Military Hats are to be superseded in the
British Army by a “Felt Helmet.” We trust this arrangement will
º ºthing but the helmet from being “felt”—on the head
of the soldier,
BRITISH REASONS FOR BOULOGNE ADDRESS.
THE copy of an address of British residents at Boulogne lay for
signature—as British residents were duly informed by the Impartial–
at the library of Mrs. MoneyDUE. We have been favoured with the
various reasons—and subjoin a few—the exquisite reasons that,
º and uplifting the British brain-induced the British
residents and visitors to write themselves down the very humble and
much obliged servants of the EMPEROR of FRANCE.
MR. A.DERMAN GREENFAt signed tº because he likes a strong
Government. He also likes success; there is no getting on in this
world without it. Has always believed that the French were only to
be ruled with a rod of iron, and believed that Louis NApoleon was
the very man to keep that rod in pickle.”
MR, SHADRAch. SHERELs, money scrivener, signed “because he
would always support legitimate government. im as was strongest
was always mos timate. As a conscientious Jew he didn't care
about France, having, of course, his serious thoughts fixed on settling
down in his old age in New Jerusalem. Didn’t think much of Louis
NApoleon when once upon a time, he come into the City of London
with his bills; wºuldn't look at his paper at no price. . But times is
changed. Would do his bill now—if not at a very long date—not only
with pleasure, but with great interest.”
CAPTAIN º SIMcox, (of the Stonehenge, Yeomanry),
signed “because he liked Pluck. And the EMPEROR had shown him-
self a clever fellow. He had proved to pe that he had head beside
pluck. Without pluck, who could have a stake in any country?” .
PROFEssoR Wöbbies signed “because he dered His Imperial
Majesty to be one of Pittarch's men. The EMPERoR had the true
heroic nose. It was a vulgar error that the world was governed by
º: no; the nºses carried it. Waterloo was won by a nose. The
nose is the natural sceptre. The Emperor was born a natural.”
John STRAIght, Esq., (retired on his º signed because “he
thought the EMPEROR so very much improved, having sown all his
wild oats. Was residing at logne when Napoleon landed,
and was bundled like a sack of sawdust into a eart and delivered at
the prison. But circumstances being , would now with the
º est lºsure give in his adhesion to Saviour and Protector
of France!”
MRs. Deputy Botolph would sign “because the dear EMPERoR
had asked herself and JEMIMA to the ball at the Tooleries; besides, His
Majesty looked such a hero upon horseback.”
Miss AGNEs Bochurch signed “with a sense of gratitude to the
dear EMPREss, who had brought in such a darling style of dressing the
hair.” Miss A.B. was, when in Paris, once taken for the EMPREss.
THE FAT OF THE LAND AND LAMBETH.
ONE MR. Rhodes, of Carlisle Street, Lambeth, is summoned before
the Lambeth Street Magistrate to answer for the what shall we call
it—indiscretion (?) of boiling down, putrid fat on his premises to the
º of the health of his neighbours, causing thereby, “nausea,
and even vomiting.” MR. SecKER turns to the wisdom of Parliament
enshrined in the Nuisance Act, but found that—
“The words relating to any dwelling-house or building being found in a filthy and
unwholesome condition applied not, as he took it, to places where a trade or business
was carried on, but to common iodging-houses and places of that description, and the
other part of the clause did not apply to the premises described."
That is, if you can make a trade of a nuisance, if you can “carry on a
business” by fat-melting, the evil to the public is to be allowed be-
cause of the profit to the individual. You may turn a whole parish
sick, if you can turn the penny upon their “nausea and vomiting.”
EDITORIAL CANDOUR.
THE Morning Herald has recently made an approach to the principle
of abolishing, the anonymous in newspaper writing, and has made
a sort of indirect disclosure of its º by meeting the public
half-way in authorising an *}}.}}| that has i. existed in the
minds of the community. The Herald of Tuesday, the 20th of Septem:
ber, after saying, “we have been favoured with the following letter,”
prints a communication beginning “My dear Mamma.” It is clear
that to have made the avowal of its severally imputed editorship com-
plete, the letter should have commenced with º words, “My dear
Grandmamma.”
The Russian Bear and the Turkey Cock.
We have heard a good deal lately about the “position taken by
Turkey;” and as the attitude assumed has been undoubtedly rather
warlike, we º come to the conclusion that the “position taken by
Turkey” is in fact standing on her drum-sticks.

IRAculous Escape.—
Another of those
distressing , acci-
dents which too
often lead to a
melancholy catas-
trophe took place
on . Wednesday

party of four ad-
venturous gentle-
men, who had re-

-
a quiet dinner a
their club, proceeded to that edifice, and, under the direction of a guide, actually penetrated
the labyrinths to the lowest box on the opposite side from that at which, they entered.
Having achieved this feat, and feasted their eyes upon the scenery thus set before them,
one of them announced his intention of attempting to get out of the theatre alone. His
companions sought to dissuade him from this foolhardy exploit; but, flushed, it iss d,
with an extra half-pint of St. Estephe, the traveller, a remarkably young man, to whºm
his friends were not in the least attached, departed on the §: tº: H nded
eleven staircases, descended fourteen, and, having gone backwards and forwar ugh
twenty-two of the passages which come from nowhere and lead ºf In most
wonderfully constructed building, he made the appalling discovery that he h lost his way.
With the true Anglo-Saxon courage, he continued to explore º at º
we his co
#. went down deep into the bowels of the earth, where, far -
distinctly hear the trampling of feet, and where, in the darkness, he stumbled upon certain
whitish objects which may have been either the skeletons of other lost travellers, or else
*:::: busts and statues. At length, overcome by terror and thirst, he rushed upwards,
and continued to mount until he reached the dizzy height where the air was so intensely
rarified as to smell of oranges and gingerbeer, and where, he states, he could distinctly hear
the voice of MR. Gustavus Brooke recommendi
- f Miss FEATHERSTONE to go to a nunnery.
His sufferings at this period were most acute, and his despairing efforts to open every door
he saw were agonizing.
Retracing his steps, he explored every lonely passage, dusty avenue, and dark staircase in
vain, and finally he º the daring resolution of setting the theatre on fire, in the hope
that assistance might thus be summoned, but was º by the want of material. At
one time he says that he heard female voices, and immediately addressed to the speaker
those º: accents to which woman never listens unmoved; but his words were ºf
back to him by the echoes with an injurious addition of something sounding, like “Tipsy,
suppose.” At last, fairly overcome, he sat down upon an extremely dirty couch, and resigned
himself to his fate. #. many dreadful hours thus passed he knows not, but on returning
to consciousness he found himself among kind faces, and being carried over to the nearest
tavern he was subjected to a course of restoratives, including alcohol and nicotine, and was
finally able to walk home with some straightness. It is hoped that.this will be a warning,
and inasmuch as proper guides can always be obtained for a shilling, there is really no
excuse for running so terrible a risk as that of trying to leave the private boxes of Drury
Lane without assistance.
THE POPE'S POST OBIT.
In the Giornale di Roma, of the 25th ultimo, appears a document called the “Act of
Beatification” of FATHER John of Britto, a Jesuit, who suffered martyrdom in 1693; so
that, after the lapse of 160 †. His Holiness. The Pore has “beatified” the martyred
Jesuit—made FATHER John happy at last. The Holy See is really as dilatory in beatifying
parties, or making them happy, as the High Court of - , The Church of Rome treats
saints as some other churchmen treat bottles of port-laying them down to acquire the right
flavour, as well as bouquet, notwithstanding that the latter ought to have been already pos-
sessed by individuals who had died in the odour of sanctity. acles, we believe, are
necessary to canonization; no miracles, no Saintship: no niche in the calendar. Qur ultra-
montane friends tell us that miracles, “the º of LASALETTE.” for instance, are
rigidly investigated at Rome; but it must be difficult to sift, those which occurred above
160 years ago, unless, the witnesses are cross-examined by table-rapping, or some equivalent
means of communicating with the defunct. However, the case of FATHER John may, teach
those whom it may concern not to be disheartened by the delay of their beatification by the
Roman Pontiffs, . showing them that though, they may have had to wait more than a
century and a half for their beatitude, they “may be happy yet.”
A Proverb at Fault.
PRoyerbºr.philosophy will occasionally fail, and we need go no further for an instance
than the well known maxim as to the propriety of “a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all
together.” Take six hearty coalheavers, and, º: between them a pot of porter, upon
them to take “a long pull and a strºng pull,” if you please; but pause before you invite
- -
them to the impracticable operation of “a pull all together.’

That foul line rounds my kingdom's bounds
With intramural grayes;
Yon, pall of smoke, that Heavendoth choke-
'Tis my black flag that waves |
As Kings of old, when they would hold
A Progress through the land,
Had hunting-seat or palace meet
Still ready at command;
So seats are mine, where lodgings fine,
Garnished and swept do stand—
'Tis where doth stream the foetid steam
From the bone-boiler's vat,
The knacker's yard, which penned and barred,
Sends out its odours fat;
The slaughter-vault, whence, ne’er at fault,
Peereth the carrion rat.
In tanneries' stink, on cesspools’ brink,
sit and sleep and snuff;
The feyer's breath brings me no death,
I hold such terrors stuff;
The odours flung from Smithfield dung
To me smell sweet enough.
I’ve my own graves to take the slaves
Whom 'tis my mood to kill;
The parish may the cost defray,
Full pits my pockets fill.
I’ve gains allowed from shell and shroud—
Each pauper brings his bill!
When of my field an inch I yield,
I yield it nothing loath;
The vacant spot is straight a plot
For Compensation's growth-
That vigorous weed whose fruitful seed
I sow and harvest both.
While thus Irule, the good old school
Rebellious spirits tames:
My sway supports in camps and courts-
One shape of many names'
Who, dares make fight 'gainst Wested Right?
Who dares gainsay my claims?

INFALLIBLE BUBBLES.
(To Mr. Punch.)
“Although yours is not a medical journal, I am sure
you will readily give insertion to a few lines, which may be
rendered, º means of your enormous circulation, instru-
mental in the preservation of thousands of lives. Cases of
recent occurrence have fearfully º the fact—
previously well, enough established—of the dependence of
Asiatic Cholera, in common with Typhus and other pestilences,
on the inhalation of the gaseous products of putrefactive
decomposition. These consist principally, of sulphuretted
hydrogen; indeed that gas is, , there can be no doubt, the
noxious agent. Now, Sir, I wish to direct public attention to
an infallible preventive of Cholcra, and every other disease of
zymotic origin, which, in the form of an antidote against the

§. know that the cardinaſ doctrine of that science is that

is a gaseous compound analogous to, or like, sulphuretted
hydrogen: I mean seleniuretted hydrogen, also called hydro-
selenic acid. The inhalation of a measure of atmospheric
air, otherwise pure, containing one part in ten billions of this
gas, will secure any individual whatever inst both Cholera,
and the whole class of affections resulting from the same cause.
“Observe, only, that in order that, the remedy may be
enabled to act all impediments to its operation must be
carefully removed. Sulphuretted hydrogen must cease to be
breathed. The drainage of the neighbourhood should be ren-
dered efficient; all the sewers should be flushed and trapped;
all the cesspools stopped; all the graveyards closed; all the

A NEW DEPARTMENT OF FLUNKEYISM.
QNE of our contemporaries—the Observer—not satisfied with regis-
tering the mere dinner-givings, déjeiners, migrations, and marriages of
the “upper classes,” has just started a new department, to which the
rather alarming title of “Accidents in High Life” has been given.
We are henceforth, it seems, to be treated to the details of aristocratic
mishaps, and the public press is to inform us how LoRD Tom NoDpy
tumbled into a ditch while hunting, or what slips have been made by
LADY So-AND-So, . We presume we may anticipate, under the thrilling
title of “Accidents in High Life,” a few such paragraphs as the
following:—
“We, regret to hear of a rather uncomfortable, casualty, having
occurred to the young EARL of SpoonBILL. His lordship, while riding
in Piccadilly, had the misfortune to run over a young, miscreant
who was carrying a basket of oranges. The young nobleman was
somewhat shaken by the concussion, which it is understood was
sufficiently violent to break the legs of the unhappy, wretch who
was the cause of it; but, as we ran by the side of his lordship's
horse, to be able to give our readers the latest particulars of
his health, we did not wait to hear the fate of the fººl creature,
who is, we ". by this time expiating in a jail the offence of
obstructing a thoroughfare and causing a temporary agitation to a
member of a noble family. Repeated inquiries at his lordship's area-
gate have satisfied us that there is no further cause for alarm. The
noble earl was attended by the family apothecary, who “exhibited” a
Sedlitz powder over night, and beef tea in the morning.
Glut of Money at the Museum.
A complaint has been made against the Trustees of the British
Museum, that they keep hoarded up several hundreds of duplicate
coins, which might be sold or otherwise advantageously disposed of
It certainly does appear at first sight rather º to keep several
hundred pieces of money of the same sort; but perhaps the Trustees
think it would not be prudent to leave themselves without one shil-
ling or penny, as the case may be, to rub against another.
THE AGE OF COMPLIMENTS.
EEMINGLY everybody is getting, so very
polite to everybody else that it is begin-
ning to be almost impossible for two or
three persons to get together without a
meeting of two being got up to present
the third with a testimonial. If a steam-
boat goes on a rather lengthy voyage,
there is sure to be a party mustered to
pass flattering resolutions expressive of
confidence in the captain, although the
ship may have gone several hundred
miſes out of its way, and there may have
been a variety of other disagreeable con-
tretemps. - - -
The absurdity of testimonial - giving
has reached such a height that we may
expect it to go still higher before it
finally topples over, and we shall not be
astonished to hear that two persons
riding together in a Hansom cab have
formed i.i. into a meeting for
the purpose of presenting the driver with a new lash to his whip, or
some other appropriate “testimonial.” When we hear of votes of
thanks ...nº. passed in favour of the commander of a steamer
across the Atlantic, we feel that the difficult navigation of the Thames
would warrant the presentation of a piece of plate-say a toothpick-
to the captains of !. Penny Pink or the Halfpenny Bee, or the two-
penny Citizen. If steam-boat passengers are to come to compli-
mentary votes, what reason can there be why omnibus passengers
should not vote one of their body into the chair, and record a series
of resolutions in honour of the driver for his able and impartial con-
duct on the driving seat, or the conductor for his uprightness on his
foot-board P

THE ORGAN BOY'S APPEAL.
“WestMINstER Police Court, Police MAN X brought a paper of doggrel verses
to the MAG1st RATE, which had been thrust into his hands, X said, by an Italian boy,
who ran away immediately afterwards.
“The MAGISTRATE, after perusing the lines, looked hard at X, and said he did not
think they were written by an Italian.
“X blushing, said, he thought the paper read in Court last week, and which
frightened so the old gentleman to whom it was addressed, was also not of Italian
origin."

PRISON DISCIPLINARIANS.

recommend the utmost kindness and indulgence. The criminal
should excite our compassion, and we should do our utmost to alleviate
his sense of the punishment which society makes it necessary to inflict.
I would, on his arrival, ascertain, delicately of course, what had been
his previous habits and tastes. If he could read, which I would
iscover by some little stratagem (such as placing a letter in his hand
and asking him what he made of the address, as it puzzled me, or some
other gentle device), I would cause amusing books to be placed, during
the night, in his cell, and secretly changed, so as not to put him under
obligation. . If he could not read, poor fellow, I, or my wife, or #
daughter, should read to him whenever he chose to ring for us, and
would accord him the indulgence of a pipe, if he wished it. To civilise
and lead him to the Beautiful, fresh flowers should be placed in his
cell—we would, in naming it to him, call it his grot—every morning,
and I would recommend the hanging his apartment with engravings
from the best masters, avoiding of course any subject likely, to remind
him º of his incarceration. Music should be supplied, and I
have a plan for bringing all the Italian organists where I §e most
people wish they were, namely, within the walls, of our gaols, to
soothe the minds of our captives. The bath should be recommended
to, but not forced upon him, and if he preferred a warm bath in his cell,
with Eau de Cologne in the water, I should naturally order it. For
his health's sake, I should advise his adhering to the regular hours of
meals, but if he desired a glass of sherry and a sponge cake, or an ice
and wafers, or oysters and stout, between meals, it would be inhuman
to refuse it. The bill of fare should be brought to him each morning,
and any reasonable suggestions he might make for its alteration he
should see were attended to. If, which I do not anticipate, he should,
º this treatment, be, insubordinate, I would, after long, patient,
and humble entreaty had been exhausted, threaten to withhold his ice,
I might refuse him Eau
de Cologne to his bath.

sent to jail, stands to reason he's a scoundrel, and if he’s a scoundrel

with a whole bone in his skin. My way's short. Thrash a rascal
whenever you happen to be near him, and have a stick handy, which
I take care ...; to have; but a poker will do, or a crowbar, if
ou’re in a hurry. The object of punishment is to prevent the offence

which they could hardly do if they were in the strongest health, and if
they drop down at it, I lick 'em till they get up again, and I refresh
their minds with pails, of cold water into the bargain. That's the
right system. Ever kill them? Well, not often. Sometimes they die
out of spite, for these boys are very malicious and revengeful, and will
do anything to get an officer into trouble; but I find the magistrates
baffle their malignity by taking no notice, and all goes on well. As for
insubordination, by Jove, they don’t often try it with me, but an iron
collar, and a chain to hold it to the wall, a taste of the cat o' mine tails
after Morning and Evening Service, a sound kick whenever a jailor
happens to pass, and food placed before the rascal, but just out

The Weapons of the Slave.
AT.Wilkesbane, in Pennsylvania, two slave-hunters under the
Fugitive Slave Law did their best and worst to recapture a mulatto,

hunters. There is a moral in this, if America could understand it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CROWN OF HUNGARY.
It seems that the Royal Insignia of Hun have lately been dug
out of a hole in a very damaged condition. The Crown was cracked,
and the cloak of St. STEPHEN, which, if it had been “made to
measure” for the Saint himself, must have been rather the worse for
wear, was so injured by damp that, if St. STEPHEN's mantle, should
fall on anybody else the result could only be rheumatism. The gar-
ment cannot, however, have been worth much, for if it was the cloak
that Hungarian royalty used to wear, it had long ago become trans-
rent, and might have been seen through very easily. We have not
#. how the rubbish came to be discovered; but as the cloak was
very seedy it may have sprung up, as anything of a seedy nature is apt
to do when buried in the ground, and thus given a clue to its own dis-
covery. Who got the Crown into the mess in which it was found is
not a question very difficult of solution; but it is clear that those who
imputed its abstraction to M. Kossuth, were as much in the dark as
many of the acts and deeds of the Austrian Government. When a
Crown is dragged in the dirt and degraded, the probability is, that he
whom the cap fits is the one whose head it ought to rest upon.

shame that you’re to pay just the same for them. For “attendance,”

Another of their complaints is, that in the fitting up of our hotels

For, while the second-class houses are tº; half-furnished, those

“Oh, DEAR PUNch, DEAR,

the buttons of which are made of coins. He has one for every-day
use made with fourpenny pieces. He has another, the buttons of
which are made Wººls. That is for Sunday wear, whilst
he has another for very grand occasions that is buttoned together with
two-sovereign pieces. º is with these absurd fancies quite a ‘Man
made of Money,” and I know a young lady who calls him a “walking
change for a ten-pound note.” f is very conceited of him to be sure,
and I am only afraid he will be taken up some day—especially iſ he has
on at the time his great driving coat that has a long row of half-crowns
running down in front, and a couple of crown-pieces over the pockets
behind. Now I wish you to tell me, dear Punch, supposing he is taken
up, can they send him to prison, and cut his hair º and make him eat
gruel for defacing the coin P I am more frightened than I can tell you
about him.
“Poor fellow! It would be terrible to see two big policemen lay their
large hands on him, when he was out walking with his little sister,

his grand pink shirt, with the studs made out of the tiniest threepenny
pleces. is talk about ‘defacing the coin’ is all rubbish, for it strikes
me that if I give ten shillings for half-a-sovereign, I have a right to do

fairly tired out of my life with such stuff!

LE GRAND OPéRA ENRHUMé.
M. HALÉvy, weary of compelling his orchestra to imitate the
tinkling of Bayadères’ armlets, or the solemn t of an army of
elephants, has, in his opera of the Nabob, now performing at the 9;
Comique, introduced a novel musical effect, upon which Mr. Punch, in
anticipation of its speedy transmission to England, feels bound to offer
a word of comment. . In the third act of the opera, the libretto of
which, be it remarked, is from the pen of M. SdRIBE, a chaise, con-
taining two of the principal characters, is upset at the door of a
tobacconist's *...* in Wales. Of course, the occupants of the chaise
are assisted into the shop, where they sing a duet with, as the French
papers say, “ y accompaniment of coughing and sneezing.”
At this we are told the whole house “dclata de rire,” and that “les
brouhahas les plus wives accueillirent ce joli morceau.”. If Mr. Punch
were not entirely free from all petty national jealousy, he might,
º: insinuate that M. HALévy has taken his idea from the
rilliant sternutations which the immortal tenor GRIMALDI was wont
to embroider, as the Morning Post would say, upon his grand scena of
“Tippetylcitchet.” But he contents himself with M. HALévy's indirect
tribute of praise to that great artiste, and rejoices in the conviction
that the belle fioriture of il poreno Guiseppe, now that they have received
º stamp of French approval, will come into general acceptation
with us.
He expects that during the ensuing winter great pains will be taken
to perforate the roofs and walls of our theatres, as managers will feel that
no singer can succeed properly in an air unless she stands in a draught.
He expects also that his contemporaries will criticise the début of a
new tenor after the following fashion:—
“Signon INFREDDATURA, who made his first appearance last night in the comic
opera of Il Catarro, has all the qualifications of a great singer; viz. a fine person, a
sweet and powerful voice, expressive and appropriate action, and a bad cold. He took
all his sternutations with the greatest ease, and in correct time, and in his grand aria
of "Ah! tu traditrice,' the audience knew not whether to admire most, the great power
with which he gave the Ahchew-sustaining the 'Ah' for some seconds, and then
suddenly pouring forth the 'Chew' in a volume of sound that Dupaez might have
envied—or the playful irony which he threw into his new and spirituel reading of
the treechay. He was, however, but badly seconded by MADAME TESTAchiana, who
was so nervous as to have no control over her organ whatever, so that the two pinches
of snuff which the prompter administered to her before she came on exploded at the
wrong time, and thus impaired the general effect of an otherwise fine performance.”
One advantage, Mr. PunchHº will certainly result from the
vigorous, prosecution of M. HALévy's idea. ..It is that, whereas our
climate has hitherto been the bane, it will henceforth prove the
antidote of foreign singers. They will flock here in crowds to Fº
their education, nor will they be deterred from coming by a fear of
overstocking the market, as they will always feel sure that there is
plenty of rheum for them in England. And even MR. SIMs REEVEs
when afflicted by the recurrence of his apparently hereditary cold, need
- awing from them altogether,
but may favour them with “My lodging is on the cold ground” (a
song which will naturally afford great scope for a display of the new
ornaments), or with “We’ll sound the gay Catarrh.” |W

OBSTRUCTING THE PAWEMENT.
A poor º". is not allowed to loiter on the pavement.
The lithographic artist, who draws, the reddest, salmon and setting
suns on the flagstones, is instantly told by the policeman to “walk his
chalks.” The broken-down tradesman, with his white neckcloth, and
black gloves with the fingers peeping out of the tips, is not allowed to
lean against a º and offer, in a melancholy attitude, his lucifer-
matches for sale. The same rigour is exercised towards the hundred-
bladed Jew boy, the barefooted girl with her bunch of violets, and the
grinning Italian with his organ. Not one of them is allowed to mono-
polise the pavement, but is immediately commanded by the ferocious
policeman to “move on.”. But there is a class of persons who are
permitted to remain still, where a child who is crying her apples
“three a penny” is not allowed even to loiter. This class of persons
is not the most reputable class to come in contact with, nor the
pleasantest even to look at. It is the betting class. Pass a betting.
ºhen you will, you are sure to find an immense crowd collected out.
sloſe ll.
There is no knowing what they talk about—and we have not
the slightest wish to increase our
their suspicious looks that seem to say of every one on whom their
sharp, calculating glances fall, “...Well, I wonder how green you are,
and'ſ wonder what'harvest i shall get out of your greenness.” We
do not like this betting genus, with its whips and switchy canes, and
thick-ruled trowsers, into which a small five-barred º seems to have
been compressed, and its sensual thick-lipped mouths, that are invari:
ably Pºins with a flower or a piece of straw, or caressing the end of
a pencil.
ow, this class of persons blocks up our public pavements. At-
tempt to pass by the Haymarket, or J .." Street, or the purlieus of
Leicester Square, about four or five o'clock, and you will find that the
arteries of circulation are tied up by those thick coagulated knots of
betting men. The thoroughfare is quite impassable, and you are com-
pelled to go into the mud of the road to avoid being soiled by the
refuse of the pavement. We wish the police would, until the entire
system is abolished, . away the offensive nuisance, for we do not see
why betting men should be allowed to carry on their trade on the flag-
stones any more... than applewomen, or even, your openly-professed
beggar. The police might be worse º than in making them
“move on.” this instance we would have them not pay the
slightest respect to their “betters.” -
“THE BONES OF PAGANINI.”
PARAGRAPH with the above
startling heading has been
going the round of the
newspapers. It seems
that the bones of the
great violinist have been
turned into bones of con-

THAT VERY SMALL (POLITICAL) PARTY.
LoRD JoHN RUSSELL, in his recent speech at Greenock, alluded
to the “absence of party” as a thing, scarcely to be hoped, but
greatly to be desired. The word “party” is so vague in its ordinary
sense, that we should be glad to know the “party ” to which Lord
John alludes. He may either mean “that party” over the way, on
the other side of the House, or that “other party,” or that “Irish
party,” or that “troublesome little party” that is always asking incon-
venient questions, or some “party” that some other “party is
always egging on to annoy the Government. The only, party” to
which we are quite sure his Lordship did not refer is the ‘Protectionist

of what has already ceased to be, and it would be even worse than

THE LANDLORDS’ MEETING AT THE LONDON
COFFEE HOUSE.
SQME of our daily contemporaries have published an advertisement,
headed, “The Times rersus English Hotels,” and cºnsisting of six
resolutions_passed at a meeting of the principal Hotel-keepers...of
Town and Country, held at the London Coffee House, Ludgate Hill,
on the 15th instant. -
What end the public-house-keepers proposed to themselves in pub-
lishing those ... it is not very easy to conceive. A mere
resolution that a newspaper, in criticising hotel prices, has abused the
º of the Press, will not persuade any reader of the paper to think
so. The worst thing that has been, or could have been done to the
landlords by a newspaper, was the publication of their bills: do they
resolve this to be exceeding the bounds of just criticism?
Unnecessary wax-lights, at 2s, a pair; port and sherry fifty per cent.
above market price, swipes calling itself'ale, at is per ot; these and
all such items, if obviously extortionate, cannot be exhibited in any
other light by the simple resolution of the extortioners, even if that be
framed and glazed. - -
There is just one use which we may imagine these ostensible resolu-
tions to serve. Perhaps they are put forward by way of blind to the
real ones which were formed at this assembly of publicans. The
º probably, are those which the gentlemen actually con-
curred in :-
Resolved, unanimously-
I. That an agitation has been, raised against hotel, charges by the
Press, which, if unchecked, will perhaps result in the reduction of
them, by terrifying some of us into diminishing our prices, and
necessitating the rest to follow their example.
II. That it is our interest to resist the attempt thus being made to
compel us, by intimidation, to moderate our bills.
III. That such resistance can be effectually maintained only by a
firm combination amongst ourselves, based upon a determination to
stand by each other, in the endeavour to perpetuate those exactions
which we now levy on the British Public; but that by hanging closely
together, we may defy the Press, hold the public at our mercy, and
safely despise and disregard popular opinion.
IV. But that, in order to preserve this happy state of independence,
it is in nsably necessary to exclude most rigorously from the
Hotel-keeping business the pernicious principle of competition.
V: That every effort and exertion should therefore be made to induce
the Magistrates in town and country to persevere in their existing
excellent system of restricting tavern-licenses to certain parties;
thereby restraining that competition which would soon oblige us to
adjust our prices in conformity with the clamour of common sense.
VI. That a subscription be entered into in order to raise funds for
the further propitiation of the said Magistrates in our favour, by
bribing them additionally to persist in refusing licenses to any other
individuals than ourselves.
SHAMEFUL INTIMIDATION OF AN OLD
GENTLEMAN.
At the Westminster Police Office, in the course of an organ.
grinding nuisance case, there was, read, according to the reports, a
threatening letter; which, as the following copy of it will show, was of a
yery dangerous character. It was stated to have been addressed to
“an aged invalid gentleman;”, who, we presume, had disobliged the
writers by growling at them and sending them away:-
“Signon Russell,—You are one very great vicked ole man. You are one very
rechted miserable man. why, you wil hart the pore horgan man that trys to get a
honnest living, for you have plenty yourself money? Why you stop the poor horgan
man to get a little money? on are a very ole feeble man, and cannot life much
longer. When you die where will your guity sole go toº You have no charity for the
poor horgan man; what charity will God have for you in the next world? what
mercy will he have for you? He will be as hard to you in the next world as you are
to the poor man in this. You will go to purgatory and stop for ever and ever, if you
do not repent of your vickidnys, you brown breeched, blue coated, brite button ole
scarecrow; now, in conclusion, three or four of us true sons of Italy have sworn by the
Holy Winon to make of you rite over upon the top of your own dore-steps one
fritefullest tomartyr.
“Sined, “Axtonio G.
“Guillo R.
* Juax B."
The report further states that opposite the names were three
daggers; but from the theological views apparent on the face of the
ocument, we imagine that the º: were merely the sort of index
which his Eminence CARDINAL Wisemax is in the habit of prefixing
to his signature.
MR. B.Rodeºn, we are told, read this letter, “which, created much
laughter.” Of that convulsive affection, however, happily nobody died;
so that, the communication was simply dangerous—not act y fatal
to the hearers. To the original recipient, however, it seems to have
been productive of consequences seriously alarming, as it “had put
him into such a state of º fear that he was nearly dead.”
We have read of people who saw their own ghosts; which rather
frightened them. Signor Russelſ, perhaps, was in some degree
terrified by his own º raised by the Italian organ-grinders—the
apparition of himself in brown breeches, blue coat, and brass buttons.
However, besides being thus exhibited as an “ old scarecrow” to his
own eyes, he bad cause for º in one of the mysterious
menaces addressed to him. . The threat of perpetual Purgatory, a
Protestant old gentleman might despise; but that of martyrdom by
being made the frightfullest tomartyr upon the top of his own door
steps, is a substantial horror. It is suggestive of an idea dreadful
enough to make him tremble over his bit of fish, and shudder in the
enjoyment of his mutton-chop—the idea of being pounded and crushed
into a pulp, and ground by Popish organ-grinders to the consistence of
tomartyr sauce.
THEOCRACY OF RUSSIA.
The Russians have been hitherto supposed to belong to the Greck
Church; but there now appears to be some doubt of this. It was
lately stated, in the foreign correspondence of some of our contem-
poraries, that after a recent review, of his troops by PRINCE GQRTs-
chakorf, the General issued an order of the day, in which he told the
army of occupation that they were called upon to annihilate º:
concluding his address º, “Long live the Czar ! Long live the
God of the Russians!” If PRINCEGoRTschakoff is to be taken as a
correct exponent of Muscovite divinity, the religion of the Russians
must be identical with that of the Yezidi, inasmuch as the latter, also,
are worshippers of the old gentleman denominated Nicholas.
“Fast" Literature.
A sponting “gent,” who has courageously entered the “lists” at
several betting-houses, has º purchased an elaborate, work, on
“Ethnology,” in consequence of his having heard that it will give him
much information on the subject of “races.”

OUR BEAUTIFUL FASHIONS OF THE
PRESENT DAY.
OUR beautiful fashions go on improving! Like Buckingham Palace,
they are constantly being altered, and never altered for the better.
What the human façade will be ultimately, there’s no knowing.
Everything has been tried in the shape of flowers, feathers, ornaments
on the top, and, in some instances, paint, that could possibly disfigure it.
Let these disfigurements only continue, and they may have the effect
of converting the human head into a kind of MEDUSA's, that will turn
into stone all who look at it. One of the latest absurdities is the wa
in which ladies wear their bonnets—if it can be called, wearing at all,
when it is falling, like a Capuchin's hood, right down their backs. It
thus forms a capital receptacle for collecting any refuse or rubbish that
may be dropt, or thrown, into it. We know one lady who found her
bonnet, when she got home, perfectly filled with dust. It was quite a
dust-bin in a small way—and the luncheon, which was on the table at
the time, had to be sent away, as everything was spoilt by the dusty
shower that the lady had unconsciously shaken down upon it.
There was another lady—whose husband is not so rich as he should
be, and who grumbles fearfully, poor fellow, at every new bonnet he
has to pay for-who discovered her chapeau to be as full as it could
hold ºi. Some malicious little boys must have amused
themselves in walking behind her and pitching into it every piece of
orange-peel they found biń about. It was an amusing game of
pitch-in-the-hole to them. The consequence has been that the lady,
who is extremely particular, º". when she takes a new fancy
like a new bonnet into her head, has been compelled to throw away
her old bonnet, and to have a new, one. The poor husband, who is
really to be pitied (husbands generally are), has been obliged, in order
to pay for the additional expense, to walk, instead of riding, to give up
smoking, and to cut off his luncheons—all of which expenses came out
of his own pocket and not out of the housekeeping. The last time he
was been he was so thin that it was almost a microscopical effort to see
him. But this absurd fashion, coupled with the other absurdity of
long dresses, has the one good effect in keeping our streets clean, for the
low bonnets carry off all the superfluous dust, and the long dresses carry
away all the superfluous mud.
It would be difficult to say which fashion, in point of cleanliness,
ranks the lowest. A classical friend of ours humorously declares
that he thinks the bonnets will soon be the lower of the two, and that
the ladies, for convenience' sake, will shortly be wearing them, tied on
to the end of their dresses. It will be relieving them, he funnily
says, of a great draw-back, and, will have the further advantage of
keeping their dearheads cool. This classical friend also says that the
ladies, as viewed at present with their bonnets hanging behind them,

We must not throw every absurdity on their backs. The gentlemen

more do you want?. As for keeping the sun off, it is not needed for
that purpose, for when is the sun ever seen in England? and as for
keeping the rain off, as it is a well-known fact that no Englishman ever
ventures out of doors without his umbrella, it cannot be needed for that
urpose any more than for the sun. Then look at the shirt-collar !

not for some such protection; and besides, we should not find fault
with our young men if they do try to hide as much as they can of their
beautiful features. You may be sure they only do it out of charity to
the ladies! The small ribbon that fences in this high wall of collar is
likewise, most beautiful. It is almost an invisible fence that is planted
evidently more for ornament than use. The wall would look cold and
naked—a kind of workhouse wall—without it. We may say that every
part of the dress bespeaks a degree of taste that would win the admira-
tion even of a savage. In fact, get a savage--a greater savage, if you
can, than one who beats his wife; then select a * indy and a

At the déjeiner given the other day to MR. G. V., BRooke, it was

neighbourhood of the theatre were crowded with people, wh9, after

exercises: the second are, or should be, poems. No one was more
aware of this than the landscape painter whom he worships so de-
voutly, and who is generally thought to have pushed poetical treatment
of landscapes to an extreme.
“But, perhaps, this writer does not tell us what we want, to know,

Child. “I am only cutting and contriving a Frock for my Doll/."
THE EMPEROR AT BOULOGNE.
(By our own Eye-Witness.)
Boulºgne has for some weeks presented the miserable aspect of a
sort of daylight Vauxhall, or the "behind the scenes” portion of a
theatre at rehearsal time. The “EMPERQR', having been expected
nearly a month ago, the “authorities” who hº him captive in
1840 determined to captivate him in 1853 by turning the town into a
series of “bowers of bliss.” by the aid of at least 1000 scaffolding
Yoles and some millions of yards of evergreens. The “authorities,”
aving formed themselves into a sort of committee of stage manage-
ment, proceeded to get up the .." and properties a month ago; and
during that month, the equinoctial gales have been shifting the
scenery and distributing the properties in a most vague and impartial
manner. Several “triumphal arches” have been for the last
three weeks staggering in a sort of drunken state in the middle
of the principal thoroughfares. . The festoons of “evergreens”
have been helplessly hº about in a condition which shows
that the immortality of their greenness is a mere myth,
for we never saw a collection of used-up tea-leaves looking so
thoroughly “done brown” as these long lines of deceased box,
dangling about in the blustering breath of Boºpas. The rain, as if
mistaking them for real “tea leaves,” and hoping to get still some
good out of them, has kept them in almost a perpetual soak, and the
º have been strewed with dying or dead asparagus in that
eathery state it assumes when the asparagus has alſ gone, and the
lants have taken it into their heads to put forth a rather graceful
ut.unprofitable luxuriance of green-stuff.
We must give every credit to the “getting up” of the “EMPERon's"
reception, for we certainly never saw so many “set scenes” employed
in a single act, and when we remember that the act was a mere farce,
the expense incurred seems stillmore remarkable.
The “properties” were also on the most elaborate scale, and the
asteboard eagles were equal to any owl we ever saw in the palmiest
ys of Der Freischütz. Immense “troops of auxiliaries” and
'supernumeraries” in military uniforms were engaged expressly, for
the occasion, and as these had to be billeted on the inhabitants, there
were instances of a quiet English family or two having to entertain
a dragoon, while in one case the choice between a colonel, or two lieu-
tenants, or four privates was offered to a quaker, who was residing
at Boulogne for retirement.
There could be no objection to any amount of obsequiousness in
which the Boulonnais themselves might indulge, but surely a “loyal
address” from the English to any sovereign but their own was some-
what superfluous. Nevertheless such a document was got up and was
actually signed by Doctor SoMEBody, MRs. Somebody, Miss SoME-
Body, Miss ANNA MARIA Somebody, Mºstºn j. SoMEBopy, and a lot
of little SoMEBODIEs ºr Nobodies, who we suppose had a family
meeting with Papa or Mamma in the chair, to appoint a deputation to
“go up” with the piece of flatulent flattery to the “EMPERoR.” We
can excuse the address of the matelottes, presented by a very venerable
matelotte, who read to the sham NApoleon the very same address
that she had read to the real NAIoleon “forty years ago, in the
maturity of her beauty” (what a beauty she must be in 1853 if
she was full-blown in 1804); but we cannot understand what pretext
there could be for a few English old women and children expressing their
-- flºº. to the present “EMPEROR.” -
eir “Majesties” entered the lowertown, having been “washed, just
washed in a shower,” which came on as they º the Sous-
Préfecture, and a vast crowd of umbrellas was all that could be seen
by the assembled multitude. There was all the usual humbug of
receiving the keys, which are never used, and would of course refuse
to fit the lock, which in its turn would inevitably decline to act, and
the Imperial couple were then dragged about in the rain, under the
drippings from the festoons and through the theatrical arches, one of
which was designed after the Arc d'étoiſe, being itself in reality an are
detoile—or arch of canvas. No sooner had their “Majesties” left the
town than our old friend Boiseas began to puff and blow through all
the streets, which he very rapidly cleared of all their “thousand
additional lights,” sending the paper lanterns through the air on all
sides, and whisking away the evergreen festoons, which were instantly
turned into º: ropes by the delighted gºus. Thus, like every-
thing else, the whole affair of the “EMPERoR’s” visit to Boulogne was
speedily blown over

MAHOGANY POSSESSED.
ThERE is º; in Table-moving—and we imagined that
FARADAY had discovered what that was. At least we thought that, if
he had not, the Deuce was in it; and we were i. right in the
alternative. The phenomenon, according to the demonstration of two
*** divines, is produced by “Satanic Agency.” The old broker of
souls is the man in possession of mahogany. The Rev. N. S. God-
FREy, Incumbent of Wortley, Leeds, and the REy. E. GILLson, Curate
of †. and Widcombe, Bath, have respectively printed and pub-
lished evidence of this fact. They have witnessed the change of maho-
y into Satan-wood. They have seen the tables talk with their legs
y, knocking on the floor, and they give us dialogues which they have
held, personally, with these articles of furniture; questions put and
genuine answers returned, with the iº which none are
genuine. . From these answers they conclude that the leg of the table
is connected with a cloven foot.
The tables, indeed, candidly confessed to both of these clergymen
that they were actuated by evil spirits, one of which described itself as
a lost soul, by the name of ALFRED BRowN, but appeared, by the testi-
mony of another, to have an alias. This rogue of a spirit asserted that
he could move the table without the hands . experimenters; which,
when tested, however, he could not do; and it certainly seems that
table-moving cannot be accomplished unless somebody else, besides the
devil, has a hand in it.
That personage is familiarly denominated the Old Gentleman. , His
table talk justifies his title to that appellation, by showing that he is
in, his dotage. The demons that possess the tables contradict them-
selves on cross-examination in a way unparalleled by the stupidest liar
that ever stood in a witness box. e Baronet whose case broke
down the other day was a * adept in fiction, compared to the Father
of it—speaking by tables... Besides it is very silly of him—not the
Baronet but the other—to disclose himself at all. If his great object
is to get people to come to him, he could do nothing. more, likely to
defeat it than to go to them, and thus convince the British public of his
existence. “The Devil is an Ass” is now something more than the
title of a º
The tables refused to move when the Bible was placed upon them—
though one did lift its º trying very hard, “slowly and heavily,”
under the burden of a New Testament. But another was equally
restive beneath a slip of paper whereon was written the name of
“SATAN.”. So it was under other names, not to be repeated here.
Now, all this is grossly inconsistent on the part of one who has always
been cosidered the very Prince of #.
However, both of the reverend gentlemen denounce all doubt
touching the correctness of their reference of these things to diabolical
ncy, as profane scepticism; and under these circumstances we have
jº º: advice of our venerated Rector, the REv. DR. DRYPoRT;
who told us that he believed in no supernatural events whatever, the
acknowledgment of which was not required by the Thirty-Nine
Articles. He added that if he saw a table, moving without physical
agency, stopped, independently of simple weight, by the superposition
of a Bible, he should be disposed to let the volume remain where it
was, and apply himself to }. study of its contents, , If, he had reason
to suppose §: the devil was in the table, he should let him alone, and
have nothing to say to him unless he were sure he had the power to
cast him out of it. -
We asked the Reverend Doctor what he thought of the following
extract from the pamphlet of MR. GILLSON.
“I then asked, “Where are SATAN's head-quarters? Are they in England?. There
was a slight movement. “Are they in France?" A violent movement. ...Are they
in spain? similar agitation. “Are they at Rome?' The table literally seemed
frantic . . . . 'Do you know the Pope?' The table was violently agitated."
DR. DRYPoRT answered that he º the table must have been
one that had been used at Exeter Hall, and º acted, under
influence from that quarter—of a mechanical nature. He should think
that one of the parties touching the table was a very zealous
Protestant. - - -
We inquired if there would be º harm in our trying, if tables
would move by the imposition of our hands He replied that there
could be no doubt that they were moved by an imposition practised
by hand, but if we had any, there was no objection to our making the
experiment. We, therefore, chose twelve honest men, constituting
in fact, a British jury, and got them to lay their hands ºn a substantial
jºule. which #: began to move. The following dialogue
ensued : - º
“Where are the head-quarters of despotism f Are they in England?
There was no movement. “Are they in France?” A violent move-
ment. “Are they in Austria?” A tremendous, movement; "Are
they in Russia?” The table jumred and bounced, and tumbled from
side to side in such a manner that one might have imagined that a
uantity of brandy and water had been spilt upon it and made it
uriously drunk. - -
“Do you know Old Nicholas’ ” The table capsized, went right
over; completely upset. … 2x
After that, what question can there be about the agency... ºn:
cerned in Table-moving? Dr. DrypoRT, however, will have it that
MR. Godfrey and MR. GILLson have not been having communication
with evil spirits, and that whatever those gentlemen may suy for
themselves, they are no conjurors.

Some little gals was women at eight.
The Cock-AND-Bottle was above trumpeting anything. But how
could any gent expect a pint of port under three-and-six * -
t least a dozen BEARs—growling their loudest—said, seeing the
cx . at which they sat, swore they couldn't afford a sandwich under
a shilling.
The ADAM-AND-Eve never heard of such a thing as “a dressing-
room.” Wondered what next?
At this time the increased crowd of RED Lions, WHITE BULLs
BLACK HoRSEs, began to roar and bellow, and snort and neigh an
kick in the most appalling style. The hubbub becoming unendurable,
the Editor—after due warning given by the publisher-threw up the
window in the face of the mob, and fired a leading article over their
heads. Upon this, the crowd quietly separated.
ANOTHER MONEY QUESTION.
“DEAREST PUNCHY,
“I Don't feel quite safe—as I have a large money-bag, full of
“lucky pieces,” every one {..." is more or less disfigured, or defaced.
Some are bent, some are chipped or cut, some have holes bored through
them to enable any one to wear them round his neck, and every one
has something the matter with it. Now iſ have been all my life
collecting these lucky coins—and I am sure there must be five or six
º worth of them altogether—at all events a great deal more than
should like to have taken from me. Besides they all represent a
“charm' against fits, against the small-pox, or some calamity or other;
and it would be very hard if my “lucky pieces,’ instead of bringing me
good-luck, were the cause of my lasting sorrow and ruin. Do you
think they could carry me to the Tower for having them in my pos-
session, or would they send me to New South Wales? My aunt tells
me they are of no kind of value; but that I will never believe, for
what was once a shilling must be always a shilling, though I should
not like to be dragged off to the Police-office in the event of my buying
a paper of pins in order to test its value.
“Yours, FANNY.”

TREMENDOUS EFFECTS OF A KISS.
Nicholas and FRANcis Joseph have met at Olmütz; met and affec-
tionately fratermised. For we are told that “loud applause followed
from the spectators as the Emperors publicly kissed each other: and
then the Court dinner followed, the two Emperors spending the
evening together in undisturbed privacy.” But this scene (see last
week's Punch) our artist has already immortalised; he having sketched
the Imperial couple—even as in an old play—"from behind the arras.”
The royal salute has been embalmed in the lines of the Austrian Poet
Laureat, Doctor Won WATTz:—
“Snakes in their little nests agree,
And 'tis a pretty sight,
When Emperors of the like kid-ney,
Do kiss left cheek and right."
But other, and deeper effects resulted from that Imperial, smack!
And such a smack! though a red-hot poker should have kissed a
barrel of gunpowder. For as cheeks were kissed-
Poland writhed and groaned afresh –
Hungary clenched her redright hand, and renewed her silent yow'-
Turkey, with a flourish of the sabre, set her teeth, and cried “Allah!
Bismallah /* - --
Naples—through KING BoMBA—cried “Ancora; kiss again!”
And ABERDEEN, folding pacific hands, declared, “it was a sweet
sight—unco’sweet—to see sick mighty Potentates in sick awneety.”
Tunch—meeting his friend, BARON SHERELs...at the Coustess
of PolkHERLegsoff-asked the philanthropic Hebrew his private
opinion of that salute. The Baron, pathetically observed “it was a
#. worth a Jew's eye.” And so it was; even if the Jew had been

AN AFFAIR WITH THE (KNIGHTSBRIDGE)
CAFFRES.
WE thought we had heard enough of the rows with the Caffres at
the Cape; but there have lately been some Caffres cutting the
º at Hyde Park Corner. It seems that a noble Caffre
chieftain has entered into an agreement for himself and a few of his
tribe to howl, leap, brandish, tomahawks, and indulge in, other out-
landish freaks, coming under the head of “native customs,” for a year
and a half, during which period the howlings, tomahawkings, &c., are
to be the exclusive property of an individual who has speculated on the
appetite of the British public for yells and wild antics. Things were
going on, pretty, comfortably, with the exception of, an occasional
‘outbreak”—which means the breaking-in by a Caffre of some
other Caffre's, or somebody else's head—when the chief was seized
with a #". desire to make a gratuitous exhibition of him-
self, and accordingly, NKULoocoolo—as, the chief calls himself—
took a turn in the Park on Thursday last with four of his fellow
countrymen.
The proprietor of the yells and native dances, fearful that the gilt
would be taken of the gingerbread complexions of the Caffres if their
faces were made familiar to the public in Hyde Park, sent a policeman
to take the “chief "into custody. NKULoocoolo, however, who seems
to take the thing coolly as well as cavalierly—or Caffrely—refused to walk
in, but stood outside the door, rendering it ho is that anybody
would pay half-a-crown to “walk up,” when the chief was to be seen
“alive, alive” for nothing at the threshold. The proprietor endea:
voured to push the chief inside, but the chief gave a counter-push, and
there seemed a prºbability of a war-whoop being got up at the expense
rather than for the benefit of the enterprising individual who had
engaged the whoopers. Upon this the chief was taken into custody and
charged with an assault, and with having desired the proprietor (in
Caffre) to “look out”—an expression which, though not v rming
in English, seems to nave had in Caffre a very frightful effect on the
mind of the hearer. Perhaps, being familiar with the club exercise of
AIR.
Q, 'tis a monstrous sight to see
The i: the British Hostelry,
Its plunderings over aghast we ;
With glances adding each long, long row !
One’s shocked as one glances; we shiver all,
Though we shiver quite in vain—
They have raised such a total, we, rampant, call
On the Landlord to explain.
Charge ten shillings for breakfast and bed!
Dinner reckoned at eight per head
Are things raised agai thºugh Protection's no more?
For your bills are as of yore!
I say, I’m done! Tea, two for one?
Your crumpets startle my father's son!
And my senses are whirled to the winds afar,
By your wax-lights, Attendance, Et Cætera!
ourm, ye Knaves in the Public line,
Your swindles lie stark in the broad sunshine,
The guests whom you sheared ere you let them go
Have made all the world your extortion know !
| Joy to the moderate hosts of France'
Custom waits upon wise finance;
Joy to your honest Yankee men !
Their guests are all travelling back again.
There they go-the shayed ones see,
Who are grumbling at British Roguery.
Take the bill—the items pare
Fill with cheap wine the bottle fair,
Strike off half—'t will still be high—
When we’ve won the victory! .

the Caffres, he might have reason to fear that their “native customs”
would make them rather awkward customers. -
The complainant was, however, most properly told by the Magistrate
that the Caffres cannot, by law, be restrained from ºf wherever they
please, though they may have agreed to whºop and yell, but their
whooping and yelling can only enforced by civil process. If a
Caffre chooses to take a walk in the Park, or anywhere else, he has a
perfect right to do so, if he does not break the law by tomahawking
the public, or any other “native” eccentricity. The “proprietor
seemed to feel himself rather aggrieved that he could not dispose of
the Caffres in any way he pleased, but it would be rather too absurd,
that the principle of slavery and absolute control over the person of a
human being should be recognised for the benefit of an individual who
has speculated in the attraction of savage yells and barbarian antics.
THE PARSON'S PARLIAMENT.
EveRY now and then we read in the papers an account of the Con-
vocation of Prelates and Clergy, at which, by general consent, nothing
seems to be done, and nobody appears to be present. If this assembly,
which never assembles, and a body, which nobody troubles himself
form, is supposed to represent the Church, we must admit that the
representation is-as far as sinecurism is concerned—a very faithful
one. The proceedings at the last meeting consisted of a rather dull
duett, between the Archbishop's commissioner and his Grace's regis-
trar. The latter in a lengthened solo gave the whole writ of prorogation
at full length, and the former chimed in at the conclusion with an
announcement that the business of the day was ended. The scene of
this melancholy farce is always the Jerusalem, Chambers. It would
perhaps give life to the scene if MR. Cook would lend from ASTLEy's
a J.. pony or two by way of affording a little fit companionshi
to the commissioner and registrar, who must be rather sick of eac
other, and might be glad to welcome a little congenial society. The
addition we have suggested might be sanctioned, under the plea that
the Vicar of Bray would then have a representative.

OUR CITY ARTICLE. MODERN MYTHOLOGY.
-- -------------- annulliull - - - ONE of our serious contemporaries, in re-
ºffl||Nº|| º , HE present financial crisis ap- cording a fashionabl - describes th
*";;.º:##:
one of those Money Articles with
which he has stepped forward
in other times of #. and
which, have instantly restored
stability and confidence. Regard-
less, therefore, of his own per-
sonal comfort, he attended the
Stock Market one day during the
past week.
Mr. Punch was struck by the
exceeding helplessness of the
ntlemen, in whose hands, is
the political thermometer, better
known as the Funds. They dis-
played an avidity in grasping
at the slightest hint, which was
only equalled by the hurry with
which they sprang away to do
i.; before they compre-
hended the real bearing of the
information. Indeed, if these
gentlemen of the Stock Exchan
waited until they understood #.
actual tendency of the events
upon which they deal, some of
them might wait long enough,
Mr. Punch casually remarked to a friend that “ABERDEEN was out this morning,” and
there was a rush of fifty men eager to buy on account of the good news., Had they paused
to hear Mr. Punch iá, “walking in Kensington Gardens,” they might have spared their
trouble. Subsequently, the same gentleman was heard to say, “Not so tight as it was.”
Away hurried the correspondents of the papers, and told, everybody, that the tightness
of the market was disappearing. . Mr. Punch merely alluded to his hat, which had been a
little uncomfortable ...}}. had his hair cut. “Will open flatly,” an observation Mr. Punch
simply applied to the Princess's Theatre, was construed into a prophecy of the state of the
Market next day, and business was done accordingly. But the greatest coup, and one for
which MR. GLAbstone owes Mr. Punch a good turn, was the latter gentleman's saying, as he
left the Exchange, “Those new Stocks are the best, because they always keep up so well.”
The new creations, for whose non-popularity the CHANCELLOR OF THE Exchequer has been
much twitted by financiers who do not know discount from premium, immediately sprang
into activity, and yet Mr. Punch's remark was simply, apropos of his friend's * a
rather seedy tie round his neck. He hopes that Exchequer BILL, as the RIGHT Hon.
WILLIAM is rather irreverently called in the City, will remember this good service next
time Mr. Punch hints that it is time the duty should come off paper.
While the news was favourable to Russia, the Bears were very elate, but as soon as
it was known that Punch had declared against ABERDEEN and for an English policy, the Bulls
exulted. SHAksperE was quoted at random, but usually wrongly. The jobbers were scarce,
owing to the Irish Brigade being out of the country. There was a rumour that a large
operator had come, but it turned out to be only a fat surgical practitioner who had mistaken
his way, and was, of course, exposed to the graceful jocularity of the House. A Bank
Director came on and made some practical jokes, from which it was surmised that the Bank
reserve was very small. Prices jumped about on, every side, and so did little boys, whom
the beadle chased, declaring he would have them there at no price. , Some of the speculators
appeared very uneasy, especially those who had a good way to go home, and thought it was
going to rain. finally, º Punch was informed that things closed with much firmness at
four, but he believes this must apply to the gates. . . -
Under all circumstances, Mr. }}. strongly advises holders to be neither rash nor fearful,
while sellers should abstain, alike from temérity and timidity. All parties had better be
ſº by circumstances, and not attempt to lay down Medo-Persian rules for themselves.
et Prudence be their beacon, and Wisdom their chart. They will do well to watch the course
of events, but not to surmise that they understand them, while at the same time taking care
not to shut their eyes to contingencies. A thing, may happen, or it may not, but, the wise
man, will discern the signs of the times. . By following, this advice, which Mr. Punch has
carefully framed upon the model of what is given by all the recognised financial authorities,
he has no doubt that through the shoals of the present crisis the Bark of Public Confidence
may be steered into the haven of prosperity.
THE IMPERTINENCE OF SCIENCE.
SoMEBODY has invented an instrument which he calls a Lunarium, and which is calculated
to look so very closely into the Moon's face, that the Moon's age—exact to a quarter of an
hour—may be discovered. Really this seems hardly fair towards the Moon, for it ought to
be remembered that
“Luna, Luna, Luna's a lady '
and no lady—at least none of our acquaintance—could stand against the force of an instrument
so powerful as to detect every furrow, wrinkle, or even crease in her countenance. It is all
very well for the sons of science to be continually staring Luna in the face, through the
medium of º telescopes; but having, satisfied themselves of the “Moon's Age,” they
might surely be satisfied without continually publishing the fact for the gratification of an
impertinent curiosity.
nuptial rites were celebrated at St. George's,
Hanover Square; and we are further informed
that the REv. BERRY.M. Huntingdon officiated.
We did not know that the priests of HYMEN
were styled Reverend, nor were we aware that
the divinity in question had any altar in
St. George's church.
WHAT THE “BRITISH GRENADIER " IS
INEVITABLY COMING TO.
SoME talk of ALEXANDER, and some of PER1.
CLES,
Of HECTOR and Lysan DER, and such old Guys
as these ;
But of all the horrid objects, the “wust” I do
eclare,
Is the Prusso-Russo-Belgo-Gallo-British Grena-
1er.
Integrity of Foreign Powers.
THE preservation of, the integrity of the
Ottoman Empire is no doubt a very important
object; but a matter of no less consequence
is the restoration of the *f; of the Kingdom
of Spain, which it has lost in cheating its
creditors.
PATRIOTISM OF THE FIRST WATER.
MR. FRANCIs MAGUIRE talks of “patriots
of the purest water.” Pity is it that such water
so seldom comes out of the Liffey.

OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.–No. 7.
It would be a mistake for a person of taste to leave Paris without
dining at PHILIPPE's, the great artist, who dwells in the Rue Mont-
orgueil. There is the very highest authority (an Ex-Chancellor, a
Bishop or two, and my friend JollyBoy) for stating that this house is
by far the best in the city; and so, Sir, º the interests of your
aper and my country in view, f accepted the invitation of HARRY
RToI.AN, himself no judge, to meet a small party there. There
were old Mºrrisovie Sheffield Higson, and DE Councy of the
Embassy, a young Frenchman named MonstEUR FREDERic Hulot,
PROTocol, DEFAULTER, and your Correspondent.
Hulot (a great ass) who dresses à l’Anglais in a pantalon a la
gentlemens-ridºres, and rides a grey mare with very long legs in the
Champs º fastened on to Kiº. and gabbled away about
le Liverpool Stipple Chase and Monsieur Mason, wanting to know
how much an English horse, pure blood, would cost. He was to be
showy and very quiet. MARTINGALE rather bluntly told him, he had
better learn to ride, before he thought of buying a horse. DE FAULTER
invited your º to come and play &cartó at the Cercle some
evening. A very friendly nice fellow. He was in some cavalry regi-
ment, but sold out... I forget why he left the Rag., Perhaps it was toolsall;
noisy a club for him. Sherpińld Higson was holding forth, to the
great disgust of DE, Councy, about the English constitution, main:
taining the universal corruption of the Church and aristocracy, and
looking forward to the time when MR. Cobden should be at the head
of Foreign Affairs, and MR. BRIGHT at the War Office; the revenues
of the §§ of ingland being divided pro rata among the schools of
various denominations. To confess the truth, Higson spoils the effect||
of his excellent political principles by the grossest toad-eating. He
never can speak without mentioning some lord, as his intimate friend.
De Councy listened to his speculations in horror, and was quite
unable to profess his own simple faith—that the House of Peers and
the country gentlemen had an exclusive º: to the government, and
that the devil was the first Whig. He could only turn away, and mutter
something about “an infernal snob.” PRotocol was boring our host
with his views on the Zollverein. Altogether we were uncomfortable
together, and were all delighted when dinner was announced.
e huitres de Marenne, those genuine treasures of the deep, had
disappeared when ORToI.AN, filling a glass of old Grave, said, “Do you
know I hate a fellow who says he doesn't like a good dinner. It’s
generally humbug, and when it isn’t that, it’s something worse. It
shows a want of humanity: he might just as well not like virtue, or be
indifferent about cleanliness. A good dinner is better than a bad
dinner, exactly as a good man is better than a bad man; and to be
without a taste, is as much a defect as to be without a heart. An
ancient hilosopher.” (ORTOLAN is literary, and has read ATHENAEus)
“has defined man as a cooking animal, with great justice. Advance in
cookery accompanies advance in civilisation, and they doubtless will
both reach perfection at the same time. The culinary art has a direct
effect in refining mankind; in the beautiful words of the Latin Grammar
it is emollient to the manners; nor does, it allow them to be rough.”
º: who has no Latin, here sneered visibly). “After this potage
sque aur écrévisses, we feel our hearts expandin universal philanthropy.
Who would amid lower dirt when he can nourish his essence
- É. --
with stuff so ambrosial? -
“Well, fºr my part,” said honest M †† “I don't care about
e the taste
your French iſ ery--it's all to hi of the meat. Give
me a steak of good English º you know what you’re eating then.

claimed the epidure with pity, “ º therefore without inquiry; you
should never wºrk your intellec º
or you will s e-operation of bot
e time with your digestion,
- it in silence, for it is good,
and thank the happy age and country which puts such delicate thi
before its sons.”
MARTINGALEigrumbled about fºllows worshippi ig a certain portion
of their physical º but devoted § nevertheless to the
suspicious paté with great success. The enthusiasm of the pre-
judiced part of the guests, amongst whom is of course to be reckoned
your open-minded Correspondent, was quickened by some ſº gras,
and rose to the highest pitch over a salmi of woodcocks, which even
MARTINGALE admitted to be no end of good, although the best wood-
coºks in the world were to be shot on the governor's manors in Lin-
colnshire. PRotocol here drank the health of the chef in a glass of
CLIQUOT's champagne amid general applause.
Your Correspondent is aware of the painful effect that would be pro-
duced on your readers, condemned to drag on a miserable existence on
the indigestible products of an English kitchen, if he were to enume-
rate and describe the dishes that completed therepast—all light, savoury,
succulent, and nourishing. But why, he begs to ask, is it, that with
confessedly interior materials a French artist can make up a dinner,
and a good one, where an Anglo-Saxon cook only furnishes instruments
of stomachic torture ? The fact is certain and the answer plain. A
Frenchman considers his occupation as an art and throws his soul into
it. Success is his ambition and, when achieved, his pride, and he
pleases himself when he pleases you. Compare his enlightened enthu-
siasm with the view MARIAR or Soos AN takes of her métier. Think
of the impenetrable stupidity, the indolent unconscientiousness, the
complacent conceit, and the obstimacy, which hardens the hearts
towards us of that matron and that maid, and by their hands infuses
death into the pot. O MARIAR! O SQosa Nº! be wise in time, learn
our business, and be not slothful therein; listen to a voice of warning
m a foreign strand, lest the day arrive when Missus is compelled to
descend into the kitchen as Missises used to do in times gone by, and
your empire over your employers be broken up once and for ever.
The generous produce of a Burgundian autumn flamed in our glass
loosening the º and not blunting the wit. The effect was vari
and delightful...Old, MARTINGALE, who had been very, hard on the
Lancers of the Guard, admitted that in a campaign the French cavalry
might be awkward customers. DE FAULTER ceased his allusions tº
the card-playing at the Cercle, and his coups at Norris's. Ortolas
showed that he could talk on other subjects than gastronomy, and
De Councy was civil to SHEFFIELD Higson, who, on the other hand,
abstained from enumerating his acquaintances among that aristocrac
with whose utter worthlessness and degradation he was so muc
impressed. ...Your Correspondent, who is always pleasant and equabl
was, if possible, more so than usual, and in the intervals of his b ſº
es, by acute observation to those stores of limpid wisdom,
whence he periodically dispenses to your readers.
Something in a Name after all.
We see by the French papers, that an umbrella called The Mushroom
has been lately patented in Paris. e are not aware what new pecu-
liarity of construction its inventor has discovered, but we think the
name he has selected is a highly appropriate one, and might with
exceeding fitness be applied, not, to his alone, but to umbrellas gene-
rally. For as mushrooms naturally belong to that class of things which
are “here to-day and gone to-morrow,” we think their name may very
properly be used to designate so fugitive a possession as an umbrella,
CRANKs AND CRotch ETs.-The introduction of crank labour into
gaols has tended to corroborate the opinion, which is Yº prevalent;
that prison disciplinarians are apt to be what is vulgarly called “cranky."

GRAND DRAMATIC APRés DíJEUNER.
INCE the practice of giving entertain-
ments to those who entertain the
public has been adopted by those who
§: up the recent déjeiner to MR. G.
BRooke, it was determined by the
friends of Mr. STENToR —the great
interpreter of #ºn. to invite
that gentleman to a grand Spanish
onion feast, which came off at the
Cinder Cellars and Dust-hole of har-
mony, near the New Cut, Lambeth.
The room was hung with some of
| the best specimens from the theatrical
gallery of MARKs, and a magnificent
portrait of Hicks, as Ivanhoe, picked
out with tinfoil, and filled in with real
red satin, occupied the centre of the
wall over the seat of the Chairman.
This masterly work of art was appro-
priately supported on its right by the
well-known engraving of MR. G.
ALMAR, as the º ºf the Cross;
and on its left by the highly finished
* etching of MR. CRowTHER, as the
Fiend ºf the Sepulchre. A group of
Pantomime characters faced the door;
and anºguestrianpiege representing Miss Wooºoºp in her favourite
act of The Reaper,” formed a pendant over the chimney-piece. . .
The supper was of the choicest kind, and embraced all the delicacies
of the season that could be procured at the figure per head, which was
fixed at the moderate tariff of ninepence, incrder to embrace as many
lovers of art—and onions—as possible. The pièce de résistance was a
bit of the roast beef of old º to which Ireland contributed her
national potato, while Scotland sent, her broth, and Wales was repre-
sented by a magnificent Welch rabbit. Nor was the Continent behind-
hand in doing honour to the feast, for in peaceful proximity to the
onion of Spain, stood the roll of France, the sausage of Germany, a
flask of Lucca’s luscious oil, and a few of the world-renowned sprouts
of Brussels. After the cloth—and the crumbs—had been removed,
the Chairman proposed the health of MR. STENToR, who had made the
voice of the drama heard in the midst of the hoots of a threepenny.
allery, and who had fought more combats, assisted more defenceless
emales, unmasked more villains, and danced more hornpipes than any
man in Europe. -
When the applause had subsided, MR. STENToR rose and modestly
alluded to his own º position. He expressed the highestreverence
for his art, and declared that he felt almost awe-stricken when he trod
the same boards that had been indented by the honoured heels of
Hicks, and looked upon the same sky-borders that had been shaken
by the screams of CARTLITCH. He, MR. STENToR, had had the honour
of acting in the same company with those great men, and he must say
that he felt his bosom swell when he remembered that the great
CRowTHER had º upon it when, as the tortured Khan, he
lamented his “lost child; ” and when he, MR. STENToR, remem-
bered that that “child” was no other than the illustrious Hicks, he
MR. STENToR, felt that he had indeed, in the words of the immortal
AMHERST (J. H.), been “in goodly company.” He, MR. STENToR,
would not hope to equal these great men, nor would he ask that the
mantle of any of them should fall upon him; but if either of them
should have an old coat to spare, he did humbly ask that he might be
allowed to aspire to wear it.
MR. STENToR's speech was received with the most enthusiastic
clatter of pint pots, which lasted for several minutes. .
The Chairman then pronounced a most impressive eulogium on
Winpicoxib, which was received in solemn silence.
. This was responded to by a SHAKSPERIAN jester and clown to the
ring, the friend and adviser of WIDDIcomb, who, among other advice,
advised him to sit still and say nothing.
The Chairman, in the course of fie evening, observed that “the
drama could never be in a decline while it had the support of such
lungs as those of his friend STENToR.”
After, the health of MR. BIDDLEs, of the Bower Saloon, who ac-
Hººd the compliment with a meat mod, the party broke up at a
e hour.

But MR. ALDERMAN SIDNEY-if we may believe a very, general

He will inform outward bravery with an inward teaching. Thus, as a
prosperous tea-merchant, the new Lord Mayor will have a new state
coach built and ornamented as a magnificent tea-chest upon wheels;

by addressing to us the inquiry, “I)o you keep livery servants?” and
suggesting to us the éclat of an imaginary retinue. Another wants to
know, “ § pay more than sixteen shillings for your trowsers?"—a
question we }. y like to dwell upon, for it presents to our mind the
still more, interesting question, “Why pay anything at all, and why
not victimise your tailor?”
Talking of advertisements reminds us of one which daily offers to
dye our hair, including the whole head for a crown, and our whiskers
for “a shilling upwards.” lt would be important to know how far
“upwards” we could have our whiskers dyed for that modera'e sum,
as it would be awkward to have them a rich Prussian blue about the
jaw, a piebald in the middle, and a good old matural grey on the cheek-
ne. The same accommodating person, who promises to dye us
permanently for five shillings, offers, if we don't like the look of
ourselves when we've been regularly done, to give us our money back
again. This would be but a sorry compensation for one who had
exchanged the simplicity of nature for the variegated hues of art, and
who, in the hope of becoming once more the tººlſ. beau, had qualified
himself for the part of the rain-bow. Before, standing the “hazard
of the dye,” we, like Richarp THE THIRD, had rather see “HasTINGs's
head,” or anybody else's head, a month after the operation.
Present to Mr. Gladstone.

oaken box, and micely enveloped in many folds of tissue, paper, a

country to stir a cheaper coal.”

THE INN-FLUENZA.
*E have had our
attention called
to a complaint
which, it seems,
has long been pre-
valent through-
out the kingdom,
although but
little notice hi-
therto has pub-
licly been taken
of it. It threat-
ens now, how-
ever, to become
as prolific a
source of corres-
pondence as the
Cholera; and
scarcely a Times
passes, without
at least a column
+ of “Constant
Readers” on the
subject.
We are, not
aware if a specific name has as yet been found for it; but we, think
it may be best described, perhaps, as a sort of Inn-fluenza, although
it certainly in some degree resembles also a remittent fever, seeing that
the sufferers cannot generally make progress without a remittance.
And it partakes still further of a .. character, since it usually is
attended with irritation in the patient. - -
Of the symptoms which lead to it, ſº s the most painful is a
species of opthalmia, which commonly afflicts the *. with the most
istressing ocular delusions. He has been even known, under its in-
fluence, to declare that he can see only a pint of wine in a decanter, which
his attendants have assured him contains a bottle: and candles, which
he similarly has been told are wax, he has frequently been found unable
to distinguish from_composite. The sense of taste, too, it seems, is
similarly affected. When offered pale ale, the patient not unfrequently
will pronounce it to be swipes; and in some cases he has actually
mistaken that for Cape, which is warranted, and even charged for, as
Madeira. -
We trust that, the urgency of this complaint being now admitted,
efficient means will be at once devised to stop it. There is little doubt
we think, that the sufferers hitherto have been bled too ſº an
another course of treatment should be certainly adopted. . We do not
generally advocate the use of the knife, but in this complaint decidedly, fi
wherever any person is attacked by the symptoms which may lead to
it, *. do not know if we can well prescribe a surer remedy than
cutting.
RANDOM RECORDS OF A RUN THROUGH
CERTAIN CONTINENTAL COUNTRIES.
(By the Author of “All the Great Metropolises.”)
-º-
[We rather think the following letter has reached us by mistake,
and must have been intended for one of our morning contemporaries.
However, we print it.—Ed.]
LETTER XLIII.
WHILE I am on the Continent I feel quite different to what I do
when I am on an island. The sensation that if you leave one country
you can immediately go into another, without the intervention of what
Lond Byron has so beautifully called the Blue Ocean, (although the
ocean, or sea is not always blue, but often green) between the two
neighbourhoods, produces a curious effect upon my idiosyncrasy. At
the same time i must confess that this metaphysical feeling does not
apply to Paris, because that city is in the centre of a large country, and
pf wished to leave it (which at present I do not), I should have to
traverse a considerable extent of territory.
Yesterday I visited the Madelaine, which is a church, and stands
near the Boulevards, and the front looks towards the Place de la
Concorde, a locality which has also had various other names, which, if
I knew them, as I am “free to confess” (as they say in a certain place
which I have already immortalised) I do not, would naturally suggest
to the mind a long train of instructive historical thoughts, although as
the Madelaine, if GALIGNANI's Guide may be trusted, was not built
until after the principal events connected with the Place de la Concorde
d occurred, to remember them here would be a case of post hoc et
prompter hoc (I translate for the benefit of the fair sex—“because you
are here you are prompted to think of that there,”) and as I am
travelling to instruct myself and my readers, I wish to avoid persiflage.
The ...idelaine is a #. which has cost considerable sums of money,
and it is a remarkable, cºincidence that it is Greek in style though
intended for Roman Catholic Nº. such are the anomalies and
anachronisms which strike the intelligent traveller. The façade, or
altar-piece, is, painted in very bright colours, with mythological
allusions to the Płº NAPOLEON BONAPARTE, and other well-
known individuals. The effect of the exterior is something like that
of the Licensed Victuallers' Asylum at Woking Buzzard, but I think
in many respects inferior to that worthy,and º institution, of
which an Englishman (I do not particularly refer to a i. gifted,
and irascible correspondent), is º proud. I only staid five
minutes; service was not being performed, and there was no person
in the church but # but this was § #º"; me with the
utmost contempt for t º of the * Catholic creed,
and with pity for the blinded and unenlightened individuals who
indulge therein. … ºn
The day being fine, or as they say in France, celest une beau journal,
I lounged along the Boulevards, and remarked that human nature was
the same in every climate. I then went down the Rue de la Paix–
you will observe that I am now quite familiar with the old parts of the
City of Paris—and after some turnings came to the Cathedral of Notre
Dame, which is certainly fine, although devoted to a false religion,
which, however, does not alter the architecture, and I hope I am too
candid not to draw the distinction between the external and the in:
ternal aspects of an edifice. To adopt a metaphor, the sign of a tavern
may be well painted, although the beer sold within may not bº. good;
but in saying this, I wish to be understood to º generally, an
not with reference to any particular establishment, far less to swell that
illiberal cry against hotel-keepers (many of whom are most worthy and
honourable men) which my antagonist—whom it is my mission to
crush—in Printing House Square continually raises.
Bºlt, revenions a nous moutions, (“to return to business”) I was
greatly pleased, or shall I say amused, with a highly dramatic scene
which occurred in the course of my walk. I shall never forget it, and
it may take its place “in this distracted orb”, (SHAkseeke's, Hamlet)
beside that other joke, which, as I have already told my readers, will
throw me into paradoxes of laughter at any hour or time. Wake me
and tell me the house is on fire, assure me there is an earthquake, let
me hear that a printer's unpardonable carelessness has made a news-
aper under my charge say a reverend ºffº reached before
RINCE ALBERT instead of preached, before H. R.H., and that the
Court, refuses to receive my published #; ;, still, if you tell me
the joke in question, I shall laugh. . But I think the following dialogue
is as rich as the other, Arcades ambo, (the fair sex must excuse me if
I do not translate this). I saw a respectable gentleman's handkerchief
#."; from his coat pocket, and knowing the disagreeableness of
nding that humble but useful article missing, especially in the in-
uenza period, I thought I would waive ceremony, and though unintro-
duced, suggest to him the advisability of a precautionary measure. So,
touching my hat with some playfulness, I said, “Monsieur, vous roulez
rdre votre parapluie.” (I must not translate this, or the joke will be
ost.
“Ah!” he replied, adding, after a pause, “Bah!”
But as he # not replace his handkerchief, I, who am not easily
daunted, returned to the attack.
“Mais, Monsieur, vous n'attendez pas a moi.”

“Diable /* he exclaimed, impatiently. As I never

A compatriot of my own here came up, and with the sportiveness
allºwable to intimacy, said,

..I explained that I had given the French gentleman a caution as to
his £apſuit, to which I pointed as sticking out of his pocket.
“That’s his mouchoir,” said my friend, laughing heartily, as did the
gentleman when the mistake was explained to him, and we all took off
our hats to one another. These little amenities cost nothing, but yet
may be bright oases on the ordinary stream of the battle of life.
Y. reserve until to-morrow my narrative of the taking of the
Bastille, which naturally occurred to me as I gazed upon the column in
the Place Vendôme, and I shall ". offer some instructive
observations upon the literature and religion of the country in which
I now find myself. But I can truly ...i “England ” (which includes

THIS IS THE PROTECTION A PLAID AFFORDS TO THOSE WHO DO NOT
KNOW THE WAY TO CARRY IT.
FESTIVITIES IN SOUTHWARK.
A spIENDID * was yesterday given by Messrs. PUE and
PHITT to their friends and connexions, to commemorate what may be
termed the coming of age of their establishment; the extensive bone-
boiling, and horse-slaughtering, concern, and catgut, manufactory,
situated in a densely populated part of the above district: which,
having now arrived at the standing, of 30 years, is exempt from the
operation of the Nuisances. Removal Act.
Dinner was served in a large shed on the º; fitted up for the
occasions having been decorated with much attention to taste, and
E. y sprinkled with chloride of lime in equally judicious regard
smell.
The usual loyal toasts having been dispensed with, and “Our Noble
Selves” substituted in their place, the senior partner proposed the
toast of the evening. He said he was glad, in times like the present,
when alarmists were making such efforts to lead, people by the nose
In a C e against everybody who gave the slightest inconvenience
to that organ, to see himself, and his friend at the other extremity of
the table, surrounded by so numerous and respectable an assembly of
well-wishers. He was proud of the support of the strong, minds that
despised a squeamish agitation, and of the strong stomachs—the two
always went together—that asserted themselves in meeting to afford
that support in that place. . The interest that he and his partner had the
honour of representing might be called one of the Institutions of South-
wark; and they prided themselves º the fact that their premises
were, as a wag had observed, among the peculiar fetors of the locality.
The odour of profit was pleasant, in the opinion of a wise man, no
matter what the profit was made out of, and the surrounding district
was rich in effluvia, and he hoped no dainty legislation would ever
impoverish it. Bones were not boiled—dogsmeat was not made—
catgut was not manufactured—with lavender-water. But what was
ed a perfume was often more unhealthy than the reverse. Flowers
for instance, were considered by the faculty bad for a sick room; and
on the other hand, what could be more wholesome than physic, an
what more nasty? The salubrity of the atmosphere they were then
inhaling, was proved by the fact that himself .# his family had been
breathing it for the last thirty years; and that led him to the toast he
was, about to propose. The establishment which they were met to
celebrate the prosperity of, had now completed the thirtieth year of its
existence. It º in fact, attained its majority, and was now no
longer under that control that an infant business of the same nature is
subject to. The monster nuisance, as it had been invidiously called,
was no longer amenable to the Nuisances Removal Act. The young

ment of Miss CUNNINGHAME for giving away a Bible and a #:

in the temporary absence of SIR HENRY Buiwºn, LoRD ABERDEEN
is said to have requested the opinion of the GRAND DUKE LEoPQID
and his Cabinet respecting a measure of great importance in regard to
the principle, of toleration, contemplated very seriously, by HER
MAJESTY's Ministers. The projected enactment which has thus been
submitted to the consideration of the Tuscan Sovereign and his
advisers is based on the principle whereon is also founded the article in
their penal code under which Miss CUNNINGHAME has been incarce-
rated. It treats the attempt to convert any person from the State reli;
f. as a crime against the State, and inflicts imprisonment with hard
abour for that offence. Under its operation any Roman Catholic, con-
victed of making a present to a member of the Established Church of
a “Garden ºf the Soul,” or a crucifix, will be tried for sedition and
CARDINAL Wise MAN will incvitably be sent to the treadmill.

THE PEACE SPECTACLE IN SCOTLAND.
Lives are to be grown in Edinburgh. We
rejoice to hear the news. The Scotch
have always been distinguished for
meekness and (after breakfast) even
mealy-mouthedness. They have, never-
theless, been shamefully. libelled by
tory. The national spirit has been
designated the perfervidum genium Sco-
torum! No, such thing., CALEDoNIA
was ever mild as milk: in the time even
of AGRIcola, it was well known that
butter would not melt. in her mouth,
This meek, º quality of Scotland
has been wickedly disguised and libelled,
but Coºney and BRight have resolved to vindicate the truth. Eagles
never, did breed in Scotland—they were only doves, sucking-doves,
of, a larger size. And as for the thistle, with that hostile, spiteful,
...} motto, Nemo me impune lacessit, Scotland shall henceforth
assume as her floral type the simple “gowan fine.”
We are º to learn that the peace festival will be celebrated with
appropriate beauty of imagery and plenteousness of fare. We have
gathered a few of the particulars; and although we do not vouch for
the fullness of the description for the time will yet admit of many
improvements—nevertheless the subjoined will be found a very fair
sketch of the approaching ceremony.
At day-break, Mons "... will be fired; being loaded with a cotton-
ball, brought from Manchester by one of her Members, John BRIGHT.
A procession—forming at Holyrood House—will proceed (weather
permitting) to the summit of Arthur's Seat. We give a few of the
more important characters in the pageant.
MR. CQBDEN (crowned with corn) will lead a Bear in a string of
daisies; the Bear. “crumpled”, a little about the ears, and
muzzled with the finest bit of cotton twist.
MR. BRIGHT will lead a Turkey in chains of pork sausages!
A Banner (with a walnut-free worked in worsted) borne by MR.
GEORGE Wilson; with the appropriate peaceful motto:
The oak gives place to the walnut-tree,
For more 'tis beat, the better it be?"

City of Edinburgh-decorate certain members of the Congress with
medals, bearing the effigies of a Goose—a Calf—a Bee. Anser, Pitulus,
Apis regunt mundum : the Goose, the Calf, the Bee do (should) rule
the world-Goose pen, Calf- archment, Bees’-wax. -
At the banquet geese and sweetbreads and wax-candles will, in a
savoury and brilliant manner, further illustrate the uses and beauties
of Ansen, WITULUs, APIs. -
For ourselves, we say, long flourish the olive-tree! But is now the
precise season to plant it in the soil of Scot
Courteous invitations have been sent to the EMPERons of Russiah
AND Austria, to be present, either in their Imperial persons or by
ambassador. However, up to the time of our going to press, no answer
been received; and we thought it, perhaps, useless to wait for it.
“Woodman! Spare that Joke.”
A New Work has been recently published under the quaint title of
“The Book of the Aze.” We do not know whether it is an illustrated
volume, but the “Book of the Are” would seem to have missed its
aim, unless the “cuts on wood” are numerous.
A TRANSPORTED AUDIENCE.
TRANspoRTATION, as a penalty for crime, has been abolished by law;
but transportation, by way of amusement, is, still carried on, an
MR, HENRY Russell-familiarly known as the original maniac,"
he having obtained an injunction against a second-hand “maniac"
who had infringed a º: by seeing them “dancing, dancing,
dancing, in the hall”—has been causing some of his audience to be
literally transported with delight by presenting them with free passages
to America. º: is all very well, and very liberal, no doubt, but a
passage to America may sometimes prove more free than welcome.
We recollect a recent instance of a quiet old gentleman from the
country having strolled into a theatre, where he found a “popular
vocalist” pumping away at the “Ship on Fire” with all his lungs, and
the old gentleman was about to quit the theatre at the end of the
performance when he was suddenly seized, dragged on to the stage,
exhibited to public view, and loudly cheered as the happy winner of
“a free passage to America.” To appear ungrateful for a boon which
seemed to be thought so enviable was impossible, and the poor old
gentleman was obliged to give his name and address on the spot, to
enter into arrangements for meeting the ship at Liverpool, and pledge
himself to an emigration which would separate him from a capital
usiness, a devoted wife, and an affectionate family. The feelings of
that wife and family may be conceived when º found by the next
day’s paper—received by the early morning mail two hundred miles
from H.". the husband and father had so far forgotten the
ties of home and kindred as to have become the subject of “a free
passage to America.” It is true that, after a frightful nightmare, in
which he heard a wild chorus of “Cheer, boys, cheer,” interrupted b
moans of “Ha! 'tis the night watch!” with occasional shrieks of “
am not mad! I am not mad!” he rose with a determination, to
relinquish his precious prize, and resigned to some more appreciating
hands his “free passage to America.”
VERY GOOD OF THE POPE.
THE Popp, according to his frequent custom, has recently caused
prayers to be offered in all. Continental Catholic churches, for the
conversion of England. This is very good of him, though it may be
yery unnecessary. The Pope declares—sorrowingly—that this England,
“once the island of the blessed,” has been “for a long while past
caught in the errors of heresy”—“has fallen from the true belief,”—
and is oppressed by “dark, false teaching, which keeps it from the
knowledge of the truth.” All of which evils His Holiness }. may
be put away from us, that we may all see the true light, which is the
Pope's eye—all salute the true faith, which is the Popp’s toe. We
#. however, that we object not to the prayers of the Pope's
Church ; but we do most vehemently object to the bolts and bars with
which such supplications are wont to be associated. For instance, we
have no objection that the Duke of Tuscany should pray for the
conversion of Miss CUNNINGHAME, but we do object—and might
feel disposed to urge such objection from an iron mouth—that the
GRAND DUKE should turn the lady from her free, home to an Italian
º Let the DUKE pray as much as he will; but only pray—
not prey.
RUSSIAN “MOUCHES” IN EDINBURGH.
The daily papers tell us that—
“The clouds of small black flies which were observed in many places of the island
about a fortnight or three weeks agº, again presented themselves on Wednesday
morning in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.”
These black flies havc—we understand upon good authority—pre-
ceded MR. ELIHU BURRITT. from Russia; and are, indeed, only
another evidence of the magical influence of the harmonious black-
smith. These black flies were-only two months ago—wasps, Russian
wasps, encountered } ELIII.U in the environs of St. Fº He
was on horseback, when his horse's foot sinking into a wasp’s nest,
brought a cloud of the destructive insects about, the head of the
traveller. Every wasp had his sting out when–MR. BURRITT de-
livered himself of one of those marvellous orations which it had been
is mission to deliver to the CzAR’s bondmen. In twenty minutes,
the eloquent peacemaker had talked every armed wasp into a harmless
smallblackfly. Thus, can there be any doubt that the peace orators of
the North will, in like manner, talk the Russian army out of its
bayonets?

MEETING OF THE RABBITS.
Last week was held a meeting of certain rabbits in a box in the Zoological
Gardens. The meeting, it must be confessed, was not very numerous, but
extremely respectable. - -
MR. Doubles MUT took the chair, and briefly opened the proceedings. He said
that they would improve the happy accident of their meeting into an enduring
advantage. He thought that the time had arrived for the whole nation of rabbits
to raise themselves in the scale of creation; by cultivating a deeper trust andwider
confidence with the animal world about them. . He must lament, while he confessed,
that he had been brought up in the fear and horror of foxes, weasels, stoats, pole.
cats, sparrow-hawks, and so forth. But, for his part, he believed that the time was
come when the whole rabbit people might live in love and amity and perfect trust
with all around them. It was mean; it was a moral, cowardice to distrust either
fox or weasel: they, poor things, like illiterate rabbits, had been the victims of
ignorance, and prejudice; but in these days, everybody might embrace everybody.
es, he felt his heart expand towards all created things, º
–And the rest of the speech was cut short;, for the boa-constrictor—in whose
house the rabbits had met, and over whose coils they had hopped and run—the
boa, in the twinkling of an eye, had MR. Doubles Mut in his jaws; and in two
minutes deposited body and bones in his throat.
A LUNDY FOOT LINGUIST.
THE promotion of talent is always gratifying, even when that talent is employed
on the side of opponents. MR. Lucas deserves a reward, which we should like to
see him get, for having lately distinguished himself. Among the Hibernian intel-
ligence, the other day, it was reported that, at a tenant-right meeting, a DR.
‘KNight having accused him of an act of treachery to the cause, the honourable
tleman declared the doctor's statement to be an “unmitigated lie.” MR,
Lucas has often distinguished himself by the use of similar expressions; and what
is remarkable, he has not distinguished himself by anything else, except by avene-
ration of the fore and a hatred of his Protestant fºllow subjects—if his hatred for
Protestantism stops there. But it is precisely the limited
nature of the ability which he has displayed which entitles
him to preferment: and we are sure we speak the senti-
ments of all moderate politicians when we say that DR.
NEwMAN’s “Catholic” University cannot do less than
appoint the Hon. Member Professor of the Vulgar Tongue.
e would also commend MR. Lucas's merits to the
attention of HER MAJESTY's advisers. We might as well
have diplomatic relations with Rome, as with any other of
the absurd and semi-barbarous, Governments to which we
send an envoy. Let those relations, then be established,
and our vituperative ex-friend despatched as ambassador to
the Pope. The only fear is that the salary which, of course,
would be attached to the appointment would stop his
mouth, or, at least, deprive his eloquence of that only
quality which rendersitremarkable—that peculiar strengt
of 1 age without which it would be wholly unadorned.
That this would not much signify one way or the other
is not quite true. It is of some consequence to the com-
munity at large to be presented, from time to time, with
an example of the effects of popish bigotry on the human
feelings and intellect, as afforded by the unrestrained
rhetoric of MR. Lucas.

One thought from shore to shore,

When honour bids the sword be bared.
Peace now for thirty years
With Plenty, hand in hand,
One olive-crowned, one crowned with harvest ears,
Have sat within our land,
Twin-sisters dear! To keep them here,
What price would England grudge to pay?
One price alone! Were Honour gone,
How long would Peace and Plenty stay ?
Bring out Old England's flag,
Storm-rent from Waterloo!
Fling forth to the four winds the glorious rag,
And bear it England through. -
Through vale, o'er hill, by forge and mill,
Past upland village, coastward town,
Up Scottish strath, o'er Irish rath
'Across Welsh hill and English down.
Salute it, young and old,
With God-speed on its way!
As it ne'er waved but o'er the free and bold
Pray Heaven it never may.
Still let its course to Fraud and Force
Strike terror from the air;
Still let its sight to down-trod right
Bring hope upon despair.
HOW WI; ARE OFF FOR SOAP!
lf any one asks us how we are off for soap it is pleasant |
to be able to answer the question in the most satisfactory
manner. We happen to be extremely well off for soap, in
consequence of the kindness of some eccentric individuals
who are always sending us by post certain penn'orths of
specimens of saponaceºus matter, with which they inviteus
to shave ourselves. . We have lately received in a letter
a bit of something which we are told will cover our face
with “a lather like thick white paint, over which the razor
will glide;” but as we don't want a razor to glide over our
beard, we hesitate to try the experiment. The gratuitous

THE TWO DROMIOS.
BU LLY BOTTOM.
BULLY Bottom is, in truth, “translated” by MR. PHELPs. Translated
from matter-of-fact into poetic humour—translated from the common-
place tradition of the playhouse to a thing subtly grotesque—rarely,
and heroically, whimsical. A bully. Bottom of the old, allowed sort,
makes up his face—even as the rustic wag of a horse-collar—to goggle
and grin; and is as like to the sweet bully of PHELPs—bears the same
relation in art to the Bottom of Sadler's Wells—as the sign-post
portrait on the village green to a head, vital by a few marvellous dots
and touches of Richard Doyle... In these days we know of no such
translation Translate a starveling Welsh curate into a Bishop of
London, and PHELPs's translation of Bottom the weaver shall still
remain a work of finer art, and—certainly to all humanising intents of
man-solacing humour–of far richer value. We have had, plentiful as
French eggs, translations of facile, delicate French, into clumsy
hobbling British; and now, as some amends, we have Bottom translated
# PHELPs from dull tradition into purest, airiest SHAkspere.
R. PHELPs has not painted, dabbed, we should say, the sweet
bully with the old º old hare's-foot; but has taken the finest
pencil, and, with a clean, sharp, fantastic touch, has rendered Bottom
a living weaver—a weaver whose braim is marvellously woven, knitted
up, with self-opinion.
Now this, we take to be the true, breathing notion of SHAKspERE,
and this notion has entered the belief of the actor, and become a living
thing. Bottom is of conceit all-compact. Conceit flows in his veins—
is ever swelling, more or less, in his heart; covers him from p to
toes, like his skin. And it is this beautiful, this most profitable
§.". human coin, self-opinion, which, however cracked, and
t and base, may be º off as the real thing by the unfailing heroism
of the utterer—it is this conceit that saves #otion from a world of
wonderment when he finds himself the leman dear, clipp'd by the
Queen of Faery. Bottom takes the love—the doting of Titania—as he
would take the commanded honey-bag of the red-lipped humble-bee—as
something sweet and pleasant, but nought to rave about...He is forti-
fied by his conceit against any surprise of the most bountiful fortune:
self-opinion turns fairy treasures into rightful wages. And are there
not such Bottoms—not writ upon the paper Athens of the poet; not
swaggering in a wood watered of ink-drops—but such sweet bullies in
brick and mortar London–Bottoms of Fortune, that for sport's sake
F. Puck f The ingenuous Bottom of the play has this distinction
rom the Bottons of the real, human world—he, for the time, wears
his ass's head with a difference; that is, he shows the honest length of
his ears, and does not, and cannot abate the show of a single hair. His
head is outwardly all ass: there is with him no reservation soever.
MR. PHELPs has the fullest and the deepest sense of the asinine
qualities of Bottom from the beginning. For Bottom wants not the
ass's head to mark him ass: the ass is in Bottom's blood and brain:
Puck merely fixes the outward, vulgar type significant of the inward
creature. hen Bottom in the first scene desires to be hall, and
Moonshine, and Lion, his conceit brays aloud, but brays with unde-
veloped ears. But herein is the genius of our actor. The traditional
bully Bottom is a dull, stupid, mouthing ass, with no force save in his
|
! serious sympathies, whilst he forbids our laughter.
dullness. Bottom, as played by MR.P.HELPs, is an ass with a vehe-
mence, a will, a vigour in his conceit, but still an ass... An ass that
fantastically Kicks his heels to the right and left, but still ass. An ass
that has the most †". variations of his utterance—nevertheless,
it is braying, and nothing better. And there is great yariety in
raying. "We never heard two asses bray alike. Listen—it may be
the season of blossoming hawthorns—and asses salute asses. In very
different tones, with very different cadence, will every ass make known
the yearming, the aspiration that is within him. We speak, not frivo-
lously, ignorantly, on this theme; for in our time we have heard very
many asses. And so return we to the Botion of merry Islington—to
the Golden Ass of Sadler's Wells.
That ass has # the playhouse season of 1853-4 very musically-
would we could think hopefully, and with prophetic promise. At present,
however, Bottom is the master-spirit: and, in these days of dramatic
pardonnez-mois, it is a little comforting—not that we are given to the
sanguine mood in things theatrical—to know that folks are found read
to make jocund pilgrimage to Sadler's Wells, where a man with a r
vital love for his art has now for many seasons made his theatre a
school; and more, has never wanted attentive, reverent, grateful
scholars. In this, Mr. Pineirs has been a national schoolmaster; and
—far away from the sustaining, fructifying beams of the Court-ſor
hitherto our ELIZABETH has not visited our BURRIDGE--has popularly
taught the lessons left to England by SHAKSPERE—legacies everlasting
as her cliffs.
As yet, HER MAJESTY has not journied to the Wells. But who
knows, how soon that “great fairy” may travel thither, to do grace
to buily Bottom / If so, let MR. ºne. he can—still heighten his
manner on his awakening from that dream. Let him—if he can–
more, subtly, mingle wonderment with struggling reason, reason
wrestling with wonder to get the better of the mystery !
“I have had a dream—past the wit of man to say what dream it truly was l-Man
is but an ji if lie go about to expound this dream. Methought I was—there is no
man can tell what! Methought I was, and methought I had.-The eye of man hath
not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to
conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was.”
We do not think it in the wit or power of MR. PHELPs—under any
newer inspiration, to #. a deeper, finer meaning to this than he has
done. But, if HER MAJESTY command the play, as a loyal subject,
he will doubtless make the essay. In these words, Botton—as
rendered by the actor—is taken away from the ludicrous; he is
elevated by the mystery, that possesses him, and he affects our more
One of the very,
yery few precious things of the stage—of this starved time—is an Ass's
head, as worn by the manager of merrie ...tº;
We hope, at least, the QUEEN will command that head to be brought
—with due solemnity—to Windsor Castle. Let Bottom be made to
roar again before HER MAJESTY, the PRINCE, the heir-apparent, and all
the smaller childhood royalties. Let Bottom be confronted with the
º: of the §. º. elect of Privy Councillors. And—as we
ave Orders of Eagles, and Elephants, why not the ingenuous out-
speaking significance, the Order of the Ass? . As a timid beginning,
we have the Thistle—wherefore not the Ass himself?
In which case, the Order established, the Bottom of Sadler's Wells
ought rightfully to be the Chancellor thereof.
SOMETHING IN A SIGN.
RoMEo would never have asked “What’s in a name?” if he had
but lived to take a tour in England, and become acquainted with the
nomenclature of some of our inns. To us there is hardly a sign, in the
kingdom which is not thoroughly significant; and any traveller, we
should think, who has his mental eyes about him, may see at a glance
outside the way in which he will be, taken in. Who, for instance,
would expect to enter the jaws, or doors, of a Lion without hiº;
bitten, or to get away from an Eagle without considerable bleeding:
A little matured, the Lamb becomes decidedly indicative of fleecing;
while every Bear, we know, is º prone to squeeze as many as
he can lay his paws on. Roguery in the For is what everybody looks
for, and jºin; and roasting are, of course, inseparable from a Goose
and Gridiron. Nor is the Blue Boar an exception to the rule, for it
most aptly symbolises your complexion when you leave it.: and no
one, we should think, would enter a Green Man, when reminded on the
threshold of his verdancy in doing so. - -
Of all our signs, however, º there is none more suggestive
than the Magpie and Stump, which any one may see is merely a con-
traction for the far more significant Magpie and Stump Up.
The Hatchet.
“SHALL we never bury the hatchet?” asks MR. Cobden. And
Punch asks, “How can the hatchet be buried, when the peacemakers
themselves so often throw it P’’

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IMPROVEMENTS OF LONDON VERSUS THE
ImPROVEMENTS OF PARIS.
OME attention having
been lately called to
the increasing magnifi-
cence of Paris, it is
due to themational taste
of this country to point
out the improvements
that have been lately
effected and are now
in progress in the
British Metropolis,
. To begin with Buck:
º Palace; and
indeed we may well
say to “begin” with
it, for we can scarcel
hope to see it ſº
Standing in front of
the Palace, we look
upon the enclosure of
the Park, and we feel
a national pride in
stating that there has
been an extensive ad-
dition to the valuable
- collection of aquatic
birds which absorb so much of the attention—and the bread-crumbs-of, the
bystanders. Every one is familiar with the fountain opposite the Palace, and the
familiarity of the public had been accompanied by a contempt, which was perfectly
natural. This fountain, formerly consisting of a stone ginger-beer bottle, standing
dish, has been removed, the operation having served the double
in a round pie
º: of improving a work of Art, and giving employment to one, plumber, a
ricklayer, and a bricklayer's labourer for nearly a fortnight. This strºke of policy
combined the advancement of national taste with a propitiation of the working-
class, or, at least, of those members of it—three in all—who were engaged in
the transmogrification of the ginger-beer bottle in a pie, dish complete to the
F. substitute, which, though highly effective, is exceedingly simple, and is, in
act, nothing but a plug-hole,
r our back upon this subterranean squirt, which we are º to do, we
walk up to the gates of the Palace, where taste and industry are at work in the
form of a stone-mason, who is occupied in chipping the resemblance of a bunch of
PRINCE, or WALEs’s feathers on the stone-work to which the gates are º:
When this magnificent idea is realised on all the gate-posts, the spectator, loºking
from the north, will have no less than six feathers in his eye—aresult that might be
looked for in vain in any other capital of Europe. Turning our gaze upwards to the
Palace, we are struck º the dazzling effect of severalthousand pails of whitewash
which have been lavished on the front of the royal residence, while, for the sake of
#: the sides and back of the building ſº been left in all their pristine
iness.
We will now proceed to the City, by Pall Mall; and, on our way, we will stop
at the Ordnance Office where, as it is a public building, we will, see what public
taste and public money have effected. The architect has, with a boldness amounting
to audacity, piled an extra attic on to each of the two wings, thus producing a
wondrous novelty of effect by making the sides of the building considerably higher
than the centre. Criticism º perhaps, complain of a rather too free use of
the cowl—and, indeed, of a rather startling variety of cowls—in the treatment of
the chimney-pots. Passing eastwards, and shutting our eyes—for obvious reasons-
as we traverse Trafalgar Square, we turn round when we reach the Strand, and
catch a glimpse of the º of GeoRGE THE THIRD forming a sort of parallax, to
the Electric Clock, which is the star of the neighbourhood. The first remarkable
work of Art that greets us on our way is the wooden figure of a Mandarin, which
nods to us from the window of a tea-dealer's; and this curious specimen of Fº
ture in wood is faced by a remarkable piece of carving in the form of a joint of cold
meat in the cook's shop opposite. Finding ourselves eventually in the City, we
W. the end of Farringdon Street, pausing for a moment at the Waithman
onument, and thinking that the artist who gave his head to this block ought
to have his head given to another.
. But we now approach the more ambitious improvements that have been effected
in the City at an enormous cost, and we are struck with astonishment at the bold
effort that has been made by the architect of the Manchester Warehouse on the
right to destroy the effect of St. Paul’s, by raising up an ordinary brick structure
to a considerable height above the roof of the Cathedral, and thus suggesting the
recollection of the frog and the ox in the fable, The architect of the Manchester
Warehouse, who is some unknown “bird,” has endeavoured to swell himself out
to the dimensions of a WREN, and the result is, that though he may have damaged
the effect of St. Paul's, he has made his own paltry pile ridiculous by its
juxtaposition to the great metropolitan monument. -
From the sketch we have given it will be seen that we cannot be charged with
doing nothing in the Mºſ of alteration to the Metropolis, but, on the contrary, we
are doing much that will give a lesson to Art by teaching what to avoid, or, at
all events, what would be better avoided.
HOW EPHRAIM SMUG SPOKE AGAINST POLICE
AT THE WESTRY, AND DIDN'T PERSUADE
PEOPLE.
EPHRAIM SMUG was a trader snug,
A Quaker in faith and feeling,
Little given to heed distinctions of creed
In matters of worldly deali trad
e
Ing,
And as sharp a blade in driving a
As lives between Bow and Ealing.
He’d a horror of war, but he’d sell the Czar
Steel or powder for Turk or Tartar;
The slave trade did hate, but would send a freight
Of handcuffs for African barter:
And though pious himself, would have furnished for pelf
The faggots to roast a martyr.
His stock in hand to suit each land,
I Was various in assortment;
n
ins and grace he throve apace,
ill quite dignified grew his deportment;
And he º: a strong box, with three patent locks,
And he knew what “ taking it short ’’ meant.
Till there came bad times, and long columns of crimes
Filled the files of the morning papers,
How cribs had been cracked, and tills ransacked,
And all sorts of burglarious capers,
Set forth without stint by all arts of print
To attract the gobemouches and gapers.
But SMUG only jeered, as these stories appeared,
At the nervousness of each neighbour;
Said it would be absurd, were cost incurred
In blunderbuss, pistol, and sabre;
And when the Police ’twas resolved to increase,
He declaimed about waste of labour.
But the Westry still, to guard shop and till,
Woted rates, spite of all objectors:
Laid in bars and bolts, and revolvers from Colt's,
And a pack of canine protectors;
While EPHBAIM SMUg called their fears humbug,
And snubbed the Police Inspectors!
He railed at the cost; counted up what was lost
In alarum, and dog, and detective;
At the Westry he got excessively hot,
And descended to invective, - ..
Calling stories of plunder, mere editor's thunder
To make newspaper sales more active.
Quoth he “Why spend our gains, in spring shutters
and chains,
Instead of in lawful traffic?”
Then of danger to peace, from dogs and police,
He gave a picture graphic;
And on brotherly trust came out with a “bust’”
Of eloquence quite seraphic.
“And after all’s done, has anything gone?”
Thus ran his peroration),
“Where's the highwaymangrabbed, or the burglarnabbed,
For all your big police-station?
Show a dog if you can that has pinned his man!.
I pause—for a demonstration.”
Some this eloquence scormed, and wouldn't be warned-
But some began to change feature;-
“The Policeman we pay three shillings a day,
And a i. a hungry creature.”—
When thus began a plain-spoken man-
Not the least of a popular preacher:
“Now, it seems to my mind—though no doubt l'm blind
Not to follow friend Ephraim's reason—
That we’ve not thrown away our policeman's pay,
If our pillows we take our ease on,
Without any dread of a chap 'neath the bed,
With a knife to slit one's weason.
“If our bars and our bolts, and revolvers from Colt's.
Have been wasted because not wanted,
Had we been without guard—neither bolted nor barred-
Though we’d spent less (for that is granted),
Shouldn't we have looked glum if a burglar had come,
And with our goods levanted P

“I appeal to the room, why mayn't we assume
That the very precautions we’ve taken -
Against EPHRAIM's advice, may have been the price
At which we have saved our bacon?”
“Hear, hear!” cried the crowd. Police were allowed;
And the faith in EPHRAIM was shaken.
OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.–No. 8.
FRENCHMEN are accustomed to boast, and with reason, that Paris
is the best stranger's city in the world. If you were dropped from the
skies into the Place de la Bourse, with nothing, as people say, but
what you stand upright in, in five minutes you might have the
advantages of a complete establishment. . Under that archway you find
a Brougham, which is at your service for two francs an hour, and a
trifle to the man. The turn-out is not of course dazzling, and the
coachman drives with a rein in each hand and his whip over his
shoulder; but equipages in general are not very stylish here, and the
whole thing is decent, clean, and comfortable. Your Tourist would not
undervalue the London Hansom; it is an incomparable carriage of its
kind, and has become a necessity for young men of fashion like himself.
Bowling down Piccadilly to St. James's Street at fifteen miles an hour
under the whip of one of the tremendously swell cabmen who ply in
those parts, is a perfectly unique pleasure. But you can't take your
wife or your sister with you in such a rampant vehicle; and if you
have no carriage of your own, you will feel the advantage of having a
decent coupé within call at cab fare. . -
Then, without the trouble of carrying a wonderful lamp about with
ou—which would be excessively inconvenient, not to say ungentleman-
ike, to our notions—you can instantaneously command the services o
a slave at the moderate price of a franc per errand. In London, unless
a man has an establishment of servants, or is staying at an hotel, he
must go his errands himself, or trust the questionable fidelity of a
crossing sweeper. -
Having hired your carriage and servants, you can at once find a
lodging of any degree of pretension (ornamented with five-and-forty
clocks, if you like, and as many looking glasses), where you take up
your abode without being bored, for references. Here you can live as
in chambers in the Temple, only very much more comfortably, with
domestics always at hand yet never intruding, and free from that in-
tolerable surveillance that a London lodging-housekeeper thinks it her
duty to keep on her patrons. As long as you pay your rent you may
keep your own hours and select your own company. (MRs: P–RK—Ns
I fear never reads your paper, Sir, or she could not fail to be of a
sweeter temper than she is; but, on the chance of her seeing this
number, alſº me to tell her that she is like a toad, both ugly and also
venºmous, likewise. a dragon, and in other respects objectionable,
while the curtains of her first-floor are a standing miracle, containing
as they do, in successive strata, vermin that flourished in the beginning
of the present century. Moreover, I did not purchase that case of
curious old Champagne, brandy with any view to encourage her in
intemperance, which is disgusting in all, and especially in females.)
As you walk in the streets far from home you can satisfy any want,
however minute or unexpected, down to having your clothes brushed
your boots cleaned (by the way, Parisian boot cleaning is an utter and
total failure), or even having your nails cut. This last does not strike
an Englishman as much of a luxury; but we must remember that here
a paternal government has, in its tender care for home cutlery, decreed
that no Frenchman shall be able to purchase a decent knife, razor, or
pair of scissors, under about twice its value.
. Your Cºrrespondent, whose meditative mind leads him to trace causes
in their effects, attributes to this policy the length of beard and finger-
nails which distinguishes, if it does not adorm, all ranks here (he
flatters himself that the connexion between cutlery and cleanliness has
not been remarked upon before). You can also have your corns
cho about, if you have any fancy for permanent lameness, at avery
moderate figure. In short, every operation of the toilet may be gone
through by means of a short series of visits without opening your
dressing-case.
You have the gayest promenades in the world, and if it rains,
abundance of cover with rather more opportunity of amusing yourself
than there is in the Burlington Arcade, for there is always a bustle, and
everything you see is #. except the women. . A few sous for a cup
9f coffee, or a glass of liqueur entitle you to spend your whole afternoon
in a café, ventilated and lighted to perfection, where you may read all
the journals, and amuse #. leisure with the manly game of dominoes.
Compare this with the "; dirty, beer and tobacco-scented coffee-
rooms of London, where they think you a “sweep” (that is the
expression I believe) if you don't make yourself, nearly drunk on their
Hºuſ fluids, and where the inside sheet of the Times is always “in
and,” It is a constant wonder to me what unfortunate foreigners do
to fill up their afternoons in our smoky Babylon.
You.dine as you like, economically or splendidly, without the terrors
|
of indigestion before you; and after a cup of coffee (almost an un-
attainable luxury in London), you have your choice of Grand or Comic
Opera, Classical Drama, or Vaudeville, the only objection to which
is, that after onge speing careful and refined acting, you will rather
lose your taste for the “genuine effects” of the British stage, and may
possibly, on your return home, set down the favourite performers as
awkward sticks or impudent buffoons. As you go to bed, without the
fever that arises from a heavy dinner with beer, Port, and Sherry, you
may reflect that you have not been bored for a single instant of the
day, and contrast with your own case the unutterable misery of the
stranger without friends or a club, who is condemned to pass his time
in London. -
CHARLEs **.*.*. having read the above, says it’s all
humbug. He lodges in Picca illy (very cheap, only £120 a year, in-
cluding a servant's room,), goes to the Rag for breakfast, where he
meets his friends; reads the Morning Post, has a game at mid
ool, some Sherry and Seltzer water, and goes back to dress for the
?ark, where he sees his friends . Then there is sure to be a
terwards, which he tops off with
dinner party, and a ball or two
º and perhaps a look in at the Haymarket as he goes home.
Qr else he does the domestic, and takes a friend in a Brougham to
Richmond or Greenwich for dinner. What more can a fellow want to
amuse himself? Let him, go to Races, or the Horticultural, or the
Opera, or the Play, if he likes; and one thing he wants to say is, that
he thinks CURLIwig no end of fun in a farce; and, as to buffoonery,
fellows may just as easily do that on º
MARTINGALE, what do you, mean, Sir P. Well, it’s very unfair to
run down native talent. And–one other thing—he'd a doosid deal
sooner have a tankard of club beer than the miserable thin stuff they
call Claret here. Sº he wishes this, put in, though he doesn't know
about literature and all that, just to show the public that it’s not
everybody that is so easily taken in by foreigners as a fellow he won't
mention.

certain gentlemen
carrying on a nasty
usiness in St.
Mary Axe,
“Were summoned
upon the certificate of

Health, stating that
there is upon these pre-
mises a large store of
hides and horns of

S. likely to be prejudicial
Sº to the health of persons

The cattle were

“One of the defendants said, he had been on the spot many years in constant
attendance on the business, and he had not, during the whole period, a moment's
illness. He believed that, so far from being prejudicial, the ammonia, which had been:
represented as so offensive, had operated as a preventive of the cholera in the vicinity
of the place in which the hides were deposited.”
According to this gentleman, if putrefaction generates the bane, it
also developes the antidote; but, unfortunately, when both are taken
together it usually happens that the former is a great deal too strºng for
the latter. We must notice one more exquisite morsel of physiology.
“A Commissionen said, he really believed that it was the wish of some peºple tº

lived many years, and his father before him, in the midst of the matters complained
of, and a healthier family never existed than that which they had successively brought
up in the City. He wished that the gentlemen who were so nice were obliged to go
without meat ſor 12 months.”
The family to which this individual belongs must be a curious one.

A HOWL FROM THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.
AIR-"I'm a Broken-hearted Gardener.”
I'M a hippish Hippopotamus, and don't know what to do,
For the public is inconstant and a fickle one too;
It smiled once upon me, and now I’m quite forgot,
Neglected in my bath, and left to go to pot.
And it's oh!, oh! out of joint is my nose,
It’s a nasty Ant-eater to whom every one goes.
He is my abhorrence, I think him quite a hum,
He’s worse than that Marine Wi-va-ri-um:
He beats the Knowsley beasteses of the Derby dilly,
And makes the baby Elephant look small and silly.
And it’s oh ſ oh! pity my woes!
The American Ant-eater has put out my nose.

TO FIGHT OR NOT TO FIGHTP THAT IS THE
QUESTION.
UR curiosity has been not merely on
tip-toe, but positively upon stilts for
some months past, watching the no result
of the hostile correspondence between-
the Great Bear and the little Turkey-
cock. The whole affair has been almost
as absurd as an “affair of honour; ” and
if the parties concerned had been individuals
instead of nations, the business would have
long ago been brought to a conclusion, by
being overwhelmed with a storm of ridicule.
If any other notes than diplomatic notes
had passed on this occasion, there would
have been no end to the quizzing that the
º would have elicited. If Russia
ad been BRow N and Turkey had been
Jon Es, if France had been SMITII and
England had been Robinson, if Austria had
been SNooks and Prussia had been TºMKINS,
how ludicrous would have been the “note'
as drawn up by SNooks, with the con-
currence, of SMITH, and Robinson, but
amended by JoWEs, and dissented from by BRow N, ou a point of
personal dignity! if RoRINson and SMITH were required to give
their good offices, by deciding whether the note alſº be read in a
Brownian or in a Jonesian sense,, and if SNooks were suspected of
secretly siding with BRow N, while ToMKINs was supposed to be
shuffling out of an alliance with SMITH and Robinson from a secret
fear of jones, the whole world would go off, arec explosion, into a fit of
merriment at the trumpery pretensions of the parties involved, and the
utter insignificence of their quarrel.
Such, however, is the true complexion to which, the thing must
come, if divested of the exaggerated dimensions which are given to it
by the interests that are unfortunately jeopardised. The quarrel would
be but a very common-place quarrel, after all, if it were not for the
unfortunate fact that JöHN BULL's nose has somehow or other got
poked into the affair, and that he will probably have to pay through the
nose for the awkward position he occupies.
DID YOU EVER P
DID you ever know a strike which did not hit the workman harder
than the master?

ſlid you ever find a “professional” win a game of billiards of you
without assigning your defeat entirely to his “flukes P’’ -

for “cabbage?”
Did you ever hear a loo-player confess to having won more than
“just a shilling or two?”

Did you ever, in your life, hail a City-bound omnibus that wasn't

Getting into their Good Books.
MR. G. W. BRookE has advertised his intention to establish, out of
the profits of his acting, a “Free Library for the People.”. We hope
that the nation, in accepting the “tragédian’s’ books, will not pledge
itself to adopt all his “readings.”
HOTEL AND TRAVELLING EXPENSES.
“MR. PUNCH,-We have seen by the Times how extortionate hotel-
keepers can be occasionally. In order to add my testimony in the
matter, and with a view to assist in finding a remedy, I have been
looking over a file of accounts which, from time to time, I have paid
for my son. The following, document speaks for itself; it is a relic of
a tour made by my son to the Highlands of Scotland. The following

“MR. PUNCH,-As there is some stir just now about the price of
victuals and conveyance, I hope you will say a word for us. I don't
eat no turtle, nor hares, nor grouse, nor partridges, nor pheasants, nor
pigeon pies, nor venison, nor prawns, nor grilled turkey, nor apricot
tarts, nor anything of that sort, which it quite makes one's mouth
water to read of in the Times—nor I don’t drink no foreign wines,
though I once tasted some which was pretty much like ink and water.
No, Sir, I likes my good old English beef, or bread and cheese, and my
pot of beer along with it, and I think they taste the sweeter when
they are not “leavened with a sense of injustice,” as the late. SIR
Robert used to say. But, to come to the point. I work hard all the
week—‘from morn to noon, from noon to jewy eve,” as they say at the
Institution; so me and my old woman and kids like a little turn round
on Sunday. Well, Sir, last Sunday was a week I went from my place in
Shoreditch to London Bridge, and then on by the penny steamer to
Chelsea, and it cost no ends of money. Before starting on the boat I
met BILL SMITH, and the following was the little bill we run up:—

is Partant pour la Syrie, and we don't sell many of those. Ah! Sir, it

LARES AND PENATES FOR THE POTHOUSE.
High Art in British Sculpture is out of the question—except as, in
the case of the Duke or York’s image and that of NELson, when the
figure is placed on the top of a tall column. This is m most instances
º far the best place for it; the generality of our statues being objects
of such a nature as to render it advisable that their view shoul
borrow the very largest amount of enchantment that can be lent thereto
by distance.
The Sublime in plastic Art is hopelessly unattainable by John Bull:
he has never yet been able to manage to pass the boundary which
separates it from the Ridiculous. We had better stick to the latter,
wherein we, excel. To be sure, it may be doubted whether any pro-
duction of the native chisel, meant for fun, could be more funny than
the forms of pigtail, of wig, of military uniform and official costume,
which that instrument is seriously employed to dignify. But why
continue to adorn our churches and public buildings with monuments
of gallant officers accoutred for parade, of bishops in confirmation
£ostume, and of half-nude unshapely statesmen with cropped whiskers,
in the dishabille of a loose sheet, apparently, draped, in an uncom.
fortable manner, to undergo the operation of shaving? These things
do not excite the feelings which they are meant to address—some of
them, on the contrary, ins of warming the imagination, suggest a
very unpleasant idea of catching cold.
But then, when British Sculpture attempts a tobacconist's High-
lander, ºr a Gog or Magog, it succeeds admirably, and there is a
special direction in which it once promised to do wonders; that of
bass-relief on the exterior of brown jugs. Here was native talent
forming a channel for itself, in which perhaps it had better run freely,
exercising originality, than labour with imitative and simious toil at the
manufacture of ideal Art-Alepots.
.On Art-Alepots, however, of a humorous and comical design, and
kindred º the British sculptor might work with immense
success. e, have abandoned, the Greek and Roman mythology
(modern as well as ancient) for the most part, but we have sº a sort
of Temple of BAcchus; the Gin Shops and the Public houses. To
the decoration of these the British sculptor could direct his abilities
right profitably.
At a recent meeting of the Middlesex Magistrates—according to the
s—the n of the Bench, MR. Pownall, delivered an oration
to the applicants for publicans' licenses for music and dancing
herein—
“After expressing his own desire, and that of his colleagues, to do all in their
power to promote a national taste for music by granting music licenses, he cautioned
such applicants as should be fortunate enough to obtain them, not to attempt to open
penny or twopenny concert rooms, lest by so doing they should attract the customers
of, and injure the draught of liquor in the neighbouring public-houses. Iſe warned
them that if they were so ill-advised as to build and fit up spacious and well-ventilated
music saloons for the accommodation of the public, and to repay themselves by taking
money at the doors, instead of by an increased sale of beer and gin, and so “create a
monopoly in their own favour, they must recollect that they did so ‘entirely at their
own risk, that is, at the risk of having their concert rooms closed by the licensing
Magistrates on the next licensing day."
Now, in the Middlesex Magistrates, as represented by MR. Pow NAIA,
and not in them only, but in the whole unpaid Bench, might the
British sculptor find models for household gods to embellish pot-houses
withal. Their worshipful forms might be carved to stand as chimney
ornaments, or to . in the character of the jolly divinity upon
ls over tap-room doors. The “fair round belly with good º:
lined,” of the worthy justice would exceedingly well become that
situation; for the national organ of music which the magistracy wish
to cultivate appears to be a barrel-organ. No stout, no song; no beer,
no ballad; no porter, no piano; no heavy, no.harp; no fuddle, no
fiddle; are the maxims which regulate their philharmonic ordinances.
Nogin, no glee, is their decree; no go, and no chorus. Therefore the
mantelpiece of every Jerry-shop ought to be embellished with their
statuettes, and so ought that of every big brewer and gin-spinner,
their private connexions, consulting whose wested interests under the
pretence of a regard to public duty, they violate the very essential
rinciple of Free Trade, in order to prevent the competitors of their
riends from “creating a monopoly in their own favour.”
LIBEL ON THE PRINCE OF WALES.
SUNDAY paper, which affects to
consider itself the organ of the
Court, has fallen into a libel
through its excessive propensity
to flunkeyism. The following is
the libellous paragraph:-
“The Pance of Wales and Tux
Shopman-During one of the late
Royal visits to the Dublin Exhibition
the Royal children wandered about in
the toy section of the building, while
the Queen and Pance Alment were
in other departments. The Paix.cº.
of Wales showed a precocious tact
in striking a bargain. He asked the
price of an elaborate specimen of
carving in bog-oak. The shopman in
attendance, quite overwhelmed with
the unexpected honour, answered dis-
tractedly, “a shilling"—the true price
being about fifteen shillings. The
Prince, with a promptitude worthy
the future ruler of a great commercial
nation, closed with the bargain atonce
iaid dºwn his shining, and walked of
with his prize. This little incident
will probably make the fortune of
the exhibitor, who is constantly sur-
rounded by groups of the curious, and
preserves the shilling under a glass
vase, only to be shown to the most favoured of the customers."
While transferring the above paragraph to our columns, we beg to
#. against its truth, and to express our contempt for the awkward
flunkeyism which endeavºurs to compliment the heir tº the throne by
* to him an act of what an American would call, “smartness,”
and an Englishman would designate dishonesty. The imputation
thrown upon the little PRINCE is that he took advantage of a shopman's
mistake to obtain for a shilling what was worth fifteen, and this is
clumsily described as a feat “worthy the future ruler of a great
commercial nation.” What great commercial principle is comprised in
the act which has thus falsely, as we believe, been attributed to the
PRINce we are at a loss to perceive; but, if our contemporary carries
on its commercial concerns in the spirit it seems so much to admirº;
we should decline having any dealings with it “in any shape orway’
whatever.
... We should like to know what the proprietors of the paper would say
if a “smart” news-boy were to enter the office, asking the price
of a quire of the journal, and on being told sixpence by mistake, he
were to throw down that sum, and seizing up some tens illingsworth
of property, were to hurry away with it. Such an “incident” would
more probably become the subject of a police charge than of a puffing
paragraph.
An IMPosing Sight.-The sight of your Bill—at nine-tenths at
least of our “first-rate” Hotels.

A ROYAL “LUNCH* PREVENTED.
It must be a relief, indeed, to HER MAJESTY to get away to Scotland, where in the retirement of
Balmoral she is at least free from the importunities of that sort of loyalty which deprives her of the
common comforts of a private individual. Provincial Mayors are perhaps the greatest pests that s
Royalty has to encounter; and the Preston Corporation seems to have made itself a fearful bore on
the return of the Queen from Scotland. No sooner was it understood that HER MAJESTY would stop
at Preston fifteen minutes to take luncheon, than the Town Clerk issued a circular to all the members
of the Corporation, calling on them to meet for the Tº: of deciding how the fifteen minutes HER
MAJESTY had allowed herself for refreshment could be consumed by some municipal twaddle, of &
which Royalty was to be made the recipient. Instead of the QuekN being suffered to take her sº
hurried basin of mock-turtle at the station, she was to be bothered with calf's head, in the shape of the
* or, and a dish of hash was to be set before her in the form of an adulatory address from the
authorl" les.
It is indeed hard that Royalty cannot get a quarter of an hour free for luncheon on a long journey,
but is compelled to give up every minute of spare time to the swallowing of a quantity of unwholesome
stuff in the way of flattery from the authorities. We admire a loyal address when circumstances
render it appropriate and convenient; but to intercept HER MAJEsty at every resting point on her ---
way, and subject her to the fatigue of listening to and answering a mass of commonplace rubbish - - *º-
from the mouth of a Mayor, is no less impertinent on the part of the authorities, than it must be

THE “WOW OF POWERTY.”
SoME Benedictine monks, with a strange mixture of the secular and
the spiritual in their affections, presented themselves a few days ago as
claimants to vote for Members of Parliament. Though they profess to
entirely de-vote themselves to the Church, they do not wish to be
de-voted or deprived of votes for the county of Northumberland. But
the best of the joke—rather a solemn piece of mockery, by the bye–
was the fact of their appearing in the character of persons having taken
“a vow of poverty,’” to claim their right to certain property, in respect
of which they contended that they ought to have the electoral franchise.
The contradictory and anomalous position in which they stood led to
a cross-examination of the claimants, in the course of which some
Hºl. views as to the effect of a “vow of poverty” were clicited.
The result seems to be, that a Benedictine monk may be a man of
property, though he has taken a vow of poverty, and that, in the words
of one of the professional men engaged on the occasion, “so far as
*Hºº ...; the law of poverty has no effect whatever.”.
. The Benedictine monk was a good deal pressed, and in spite of the
ingenuity appropriate to his “order” he was driven into a corner,
from which he could not escape except |. the prong of a fork which
the professional gentleman kept continually presented to the Benedictine
monk, for the latter to fall upon. When told that, “in making the
vow of poverty, he says he has no property whatever,” the “monk” could
only reply “We must have property or we could not exist; so that
we are justified in asking what is the meaning of a vow of poverty,
if it can be taken by a man of property who, on the strength of that
property, lays claim to a vote for the county? The witness when pressed
INFECTION GLEBE,
EveRYBody knows that an intramural churchyard has a tendency to
enlarge itself—not in area, but in perpendicularity. It is in every
sense a rising concern, and it swells like an investment at compound
interest. The attraction of mortality increases in a ratio multiplying
with the increase of the mass—and what is there to prevent so deadly
a nuisance from being immediately abolished P Hear the Bishop of
LoNDoN in his evidence given before the Lords' Committee on the Great
Extramural Cemetery Bill—opposed by the LoBD BISHOP:–
“I wish, in a very few words, to explain that, when the bill was first printed, the
clergy were much alarmed. They saw that it would interfere with the establishment
of parochial burial grounds, and they objected more particularly to the small amount
of compensation fees which the company intended to pay, viz., 1s. 8d. for the open
ground, and 2s. 6d. for the brick graves and vaults.”
In the country it is a common thing to see sheep grazing in church-
yards, but in London, by the account of the Bishop, the same pastures
afford food to the shepherds. To the eye of chemists—who are ghost-
seers—for ghost and gas “are all one reckonings, save the phrase is a
little variations”—what a picture is presented, by a metropolitan
incumbent praying at his reading desk against pestilence with the cause
of it steaming up all around him in the shape of sulphuretted hydrogen,
for the generation of which he is principally responsible! By all means

admitted, “We all have Pºpº ”— all we who have made a vow of
poverty, or an abnegation o flºº. the way we manage it is
this: “We have what is called a ‘peculium,’ which is a separate thing
from the vow of poverty.” It is convenient, certainly, to be able to be
poor and rich at the same time, and to combine all the temporal
advantages of property with the spiritual advantages of poverty. The
“peculium” is, of course, elastic, and there, is no particular place for
drawing the line, in the banker's book. A vow of poverty which
admits of a “peculium” in the shape of a private fortune is like a vow
of tea-totalism, which allows of a “peculium” in the form of a private

My dear fellow-countrymen who throng the theatres, the caſ's, and

a soldier, or a policeman., You cannot have a warm bath, without
taking a ticket from a lady at a desk, nor indulge in a mild polka,
without being watched by a man in a cocked hat. If you change your
hotel, instant information must be sent to the Préfecture; if you want
to send a telegraphic message to England, it must first receive the
sanction of the Minister of Police; if you enter Paris from a country
walk, with a great-cºat on your arm, you will be pounced upon and
searched at the Barrière. All this is disgusting to honest John BULL;

The leadin #: will point out with its usual epigrammatic terse-
ness, varied illustration, good sense and eloquence, the advantage of let-
ting, people, alone, and the extent to which our Government does let
us alone. “His Highness, or Majesty, as the case may be, will ride for
hours in our Metropolis without seeing a soldier or (especially if
there's a row) a policeman.” Blessed independence! but the contrast
is much more striking, because more disagreeable to a wretched
Englishman, born to freedom, who finds himself in a mess on the Con-
tinent—a cºntingency which happens to one, out of every dozen
tourists. Those confounded passports form the monster grievance.
Accordingly from July to November, not a week passes but some
victim writes to complain that he is in confinement at Marseilles or
Como, or somewhere or another, because his passport is lost or not en

A SPORTING REGIMENT.
SoME Yeomanry heroes, whose headquarters are at the “Spotted
Çow,” in York, have been called together by a circular, of which the
following is a copy, to have a day's hunting, on Monday the 31st.
“Spotted Cow Inn, Walmgate Bar, Fork, 18th October, 1853.
“SIR,-Through the kindness of our Captain (Lord Viscount Downe), a day's
hunt, or coursing, at Sessay (to the members of his Troop only), is given, which is
proposed to take place on Monday, the last day of this month. It is also proposed to
have a little drill—each should attend with his sword and belt. Be so kind as say if
Ayou can procure a dog. An early answer is earnestly requested. Further particulars
will be gladly given, on application to me, or Coºp. SMITH.
“I am, Sir, yours, truly,
“Gro. SMITH."
It is desirable, we admit, that the yeomanry should be indulged in a
day's hunting, which may practise them in the art of pursuing an
enemy, who, in war-time would be fair game. . We are somewhat
puzzled by the proposition to mix up “a little, drill” with the day's
. unless the “dogs of war” are to hunt in couples—two
abreast. We fear there will be some difficulty in blending the hunts-
man and the warrior; nºr can we gºmprehend the idea of a sporting
military gent running after a fox with “his sword and belt,” “taking
close order” at the heels of Reynard, or practising the goose-step by
way of “a little drill” #. to the starting of the game. The
passage in the circular which asks every trooper to “be so kind as to
say” if he “can procure a dog,” is suggestive of an awful assemblage of
mongrels, and destructive to all our ideas of “sport.”
We can º the canine Babel that would be the consequence if the
brutes should happen to “give tongue.” If everybody is “so kind as
to procure a dog,” there would inevitably be a regiment of dogs as well
as a regiment of soldiers; there can be no objection to a vast assem-
blage of dogs at any given point for a given period, but when the dogs
have had their day, we would ask in a spirit of much misgiving, what
is to become of these dogs when the drilſ is at an end ? We can only
say that we should be sorry to eat a sausage within five miles of the
place where that, troop had been assembled, until at least a month
after they should be disbanded, and their dogs should have disappeared.
PIUS PINGUIS.
THAT, the Pope should have been ordered to play billiards to coun-
teract obesity, is a circumstance suggestive of certain natural remarks.
A person who fasts as often as the É. Pontiff must fast, and yet
gets fat, is a wonder; and perhaps the plumpness of PIUs, attained
principally on red herrings, will be, cited one of these days as a
miraculous circumstance. FALSTAFF lost his voice “by holloaing and
singing of anthems;” but in the meanwhile he gained flesh, as his
Holiness appears to have also done in a similar course of exercise.
Many prelates are oily enough; but the unction of the present Bishop
of Rome is peculiar. . The Pontifical chair has often been said to be
filled, but now it is full, and no mistake. Perfidy, the Papists i.
never approached the see of PETER ; however that may be, it certainl
will be difficult to circumvent its existing occupant, as his bulk w
baffle any attempt to get round him. Many of the Holy Father's
predecessors have been deep, but he is broad also.
We should have preferred rackets to billiards as a cure for the Papal
corpulence, if we thought the Pope could stand the rackets, as he will
have to do, whether he can or not, as soon as the state of Europe
obliges Louis NAPOLEON to withdraw the French º: from Rome;
and that will prove the most effectual proceeding for the reduction of
his greatness.
News for the Peace Congress.
#: Submarine and European Telegraph pulsates with these glad
tidings:–
“Six new steam-vessels, after the model of the Napoleon, are on the stocks, and will
be launched about the end of 1854."
Our own correspondent informs us that, two of these vessels-in
gratitude to the peace-makers—will be called The Bright and The
Cobden.

SPURIOUS IMITATION.
UNMITIGATED EFFRoNTERY or MEssRs. BRowN AND SMITH.
ASTONISHING AND GENEROUS EXERTION BY
CATHEDRAL CLERGYMEN.
THE newspapers are continually making remarks of a painful nature
on the conduct of Deans and Chapters. It is pleasing to encounter
an opportunity of commenting in a more affectionate spirit on the
behaviour of one of those reverend fraternities, That pleasure is
afforded us by the Morning. Post—wherein, under the heading of
“Divine Service for the Militia,” we read that
“The necessity of providing some means by which the Militia, in a body, could
attend Divine Service on Sunday, and the difficulty of this being secured by the
ordinary church accommodation available in Exeter, induced, we understand, the Lord
Lieutenant of the county to make an application last week to the Cathedral authorities,
suggesting that an extra service on Sunday in that spacious building would meet the
wishes of hug lordship."
Now, when we consider the average scale on which Deans and
Chapters are remunerated in relation to their average services, and
when, our reflections guided by the Rule of Three, we inquire, how
much; at that rate, an extra service of such a description is worth, we
find the sum considerable. A prebend's sermon is perhaps, as to its
abstract merit, inestimable: a pearl beyond any price; but, even its
actual cost may be computed at a high figure. Such a discourse,
gratuitously addressed to a regiment, of soldiers, may be regarded as
ta dºnation to them of somet . handsome per head. - -
To ask, a Cathedral cstablishment, then, for an extra service, is
asking it for not a little: to perform such a service is to do a munificent
action. Therefore it is highly gratifying to peruse the statement
following:—
“Notwithstanding, however, the difficulties which intervened, we believe it was the
earnest desire of the authorities at the Cathedral to meet as far as possible the urgency
of the case, a desire which was manifested by the promptitude with which they acted
on the suggestions made by the Lord Lieutenant. An extra service was fixed, ex-
clusively for the Militia, at half-past eight on Sunday morning, when the whole body
of officers and men assembled within the sacred building, the choir being densely
filled from the organ screen to the altar rails, and such as could not obtain admis-
sion being within hearing in the side aisles. Prayers were read by the REvghend
Chancelloa HARINGron, who also preached an impressive and appropriate sermon."
Besides, it is announced that on Sunday next, and for the two Sun-
days following, indeed until the Militia are dismissed, the same
service will be performed at the same hour. It should be added, that
the only Canons in residence were the Rev. CHANCELLOR HARINGTON
and the VEN. ARCHDEAcon MooRE STEVENs, and that the Chancellor
being also Chaplain to the troops, “had, in addition to his duties at
the Cathedral, to provide extra services for both barracks.” The rev-
erend gentleman who has been performing so many extra services,
might almost be supposed to be called Canon of Exeter by a mistake
in pronunciation; his ſº title being Canon of Extra. At all events
he ought not to be styled a Canon in Ordinary, for he is an Extraor.
dinary Canon; and in making this observation, if anybody thinks, that
we intend a mere play upon words, he is mistaken; for what we chiefly
wish is to call attention to a fact. That a prebend should occasionally
preach and read prayers of a Sunday a few more times than he is
obliged to do, may hereafter come to be regarded as not so very ex-
|traordinary a sacrifice of that otium which is enjoyed cum dignitate by
the dignified Clergy. The circumstance, at least, will perhaps not be
thought so extraordinary as to constitute a special case for penny-a-
NASAL INTELLIGENCE.
ONE of “our own Correspondents,” speaking of the EMPEROR's late
reception at Lille, remarks, as it Appears to us, a rather curious pheno-
menon. “At about nine o'clock,” *. says,
“The EMPERok and EMPREss drove to the theatre, where there was a most loyal
reception; and, but that the wet clothes and the soaking umbrellas gave out the odours
peculiar to wet coats, the scene would have been splendid.”
How the odours of wet clothes could possibly have prevented the
splendour of the scene, we confess we are rather at a loss to imagine.
or ourselves, we certainly should as soon dream of hearing a sight as
of smelling one. That there exists a certain connection between the
visual and olfactory organs we don't pretend to dispute. In the ab-
sence of profounder proof we do remember an “eye-snuff,” which they
who were up to it of course took nasally. At the same time we cannot
well see how the sense of seeing can be interfered with by the nose,
unless indeed it be a preternaturally long one.

YACHT SIGNALS.
MR. Punch has merely to º: a very useful little book
prettily bound, with the Union Jack (white margin) on its cover, an

to him in Fleet Street, but he intends to keep it until the yachting
season begins again, when he will astonish Cowes, Ryde, and “the

all other exercises. That the Yacht Club may appreciate the value
of the book, Mr. Punch subjoins a lº taken at random. Loungers
on shore little know what is meant by the innocent-lookin s which
are perpetually being run up from the Salmagundi, the Olla Podrida,

SHE WILL BE A MARTYR.
A LETTER from France says that Miss CUNNINGHAME on receiving

she was literally turned out. The invitations of the officials to her to
“come out of that,” were altogether idle; and indeed it is quite
evident that the º felt how completely her pretensions to martyrdom
had been cut short by her premature release. Miss CUNNINGHAME in
fact proved herself a perfect “Buffalo gal” in her, indisposition to

er. -
For our own parts, had we been the British officials employed to
negociate for her release, and she had shown a stubborn disposition to
cling to her prison bars, we should have allowed her, to remain, and
ride as rusty as the bars themselves. We never could see what right
she had to scatter Italian BUNYANs all over the boot of Italy, and
} her own foot in it. We admit the severity of the punishment and
he propriety of getting her out of her prison, though as a general rule
it must be laid down, that those who enter a foreign country for the
purpose of disturbing its harmony, must expect now and then to have
to take a few bars rest.
A Nautical Queen.
THE QUEEN or SPAIN has become decidedly nautical. . In honour
of her own birth-day she has ordered three screw frigates to be built

bonds, Spain been especially eminent for her enormous screw-
power.

THE laudable custom adopted by agricultural societies
of rewarding labourers for living and rearing families upon
ten shillings a week, might be carried further out. Mutual
improvement associations should be established among
the rustics, for the purpose of cultivating abstinence by
means of emulation. Country gentlemen would formerly
encourage eating-matches among the peasantry: the re-
verse of this gross practice should be adopted now; and
clodhopper should be pitted against clodhopper to do the
greatest amount of work on the smallest quantity of bread
and water in a given time. The clowns should also be
stimulated to compete on holidays, particularly at those of
Christmas, when the weather especially affords the requisite
conditions, by trying which can continue longest sitting
in the cold without any fire, and which can dispense to
the greatest extent with clothes and bedding. By these
wholesome exercises they will be trained to contentment
with the very smallest possible participation in the fruits
of that earth which they cultivate, so as to leave the º:
share to the gentry who subsist by their industry, to be
cxpended in all manner of comfort, pleasure, splendour,
and magnificence. Thus, as happiness is attainable in
either of two ways—one consisting in the satisfaction,
the other in the conquest of our desires—they would
make themselves happy by the former method, and their
labourers by the latter.

SINGING-BOYS MINUS SEVENPENCE AT ST. PAUL’S.
PARSoN Rook! Why Rook? What has Parson to do with Rook?
a child might ask, puzzled by that nursery collocation of bird and
clerical gentleman. Both black? Then why not Chimney Sweep
Rook P-Undertaker Rook? The explanation is too superficial to
satisfy even the infant mind.
Now, when we consider that the Dean and Canons of St. Paul's
have, as we are credibly informed, stopped the sevenpence a week—the
penny, a day—heretofore from time immemorial allowed the little
chorister children for pocket-money, we are induced to pursue some
interesting inquiries:–
Who took away the poor boys' stipends? Who has taken their
lollipops out of their mouths? Who . them of their penny tarts?
Who keeps cathedral stalls and ruins apple-stalls?—may be enumerated
as some of those questions which we are disposed to º ound.
But we also revert to the child's interrogation—why Parson Rook?
—and we find we can answer it in a highly satisfactory manner.
Be, it premised, that the reason assigned for this mulct of the
acolytes is that by the proceeds thereof the washing of their surplices
may be paid for. They are to wear fine linen, but not to fare
sumptuously every day: that mode of life is reserved for the port-
Winous lº. of their cake money. Wainly has the tax been
taken off soap, ºf that the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's are so
ill off for it. "But the article is an important one to close shavers.
Therefore the choristers, are docked of their allowance, and the loud.
voiced anthem will blend with the secular strain, “I’ve no Money.”
We now come to inquire what has º ned to render the
ecclesiastical corporation of St. Paul's unable, any longer to stand
.# What has necessitated the demand for the sevenpences of the
children to defray their surplice-washing?—whereof the ordinary cost
would be fourpence by the tariff of our laundress.
This has happened: the ...hº..." on the part of that reverend
society, of the twopences formerly taken at the doors of their church;
which having been extorted from them, by popular indignation, they
now, we suppose, indemnify themselves by a sevenpenny co tion,
at the expense of the little vocalists. -
And thus we arrive, at a perception of the connection between
Parson and Rook; for these men are Parsons: and we discover that
they possess an anatomical organ in common with that bird, and with
other birds that consume the fruits of the earth. The existence of
that organ is revealed by its symptoms of suffering. The Dean and
Chapter of St. Paul's, in withdrawing the sevenpences, show that the
loss of the twopences STICKs IN THEIR GizzARDs.
The Pope's Game.
ENGLAND little suspected the game that the Pope has been playing.
It turns out to be billiards. - -
His Holiness no doubt has his cue given him by one of the astutest
Members of the College of Cardinals. -
His aim, no doubt, is the old traditional one—to put the globe into
his pocket.
Good Old English Pastime.
THE Elizabethan age delighted in bear-baiting; and it seems not
improbable that the reign of Victor.IA, will witness a similar amuse-
ment. A formidable Russian bear has broken loose, in the Danubian
Principalities, and a large number of British bulldogs have been
already collected to worry him, unless he speedily retreats into his den.

LITERATURE AT LOW WATER MARK.
A Book with the odd title of “A History of the Fountains
of Europe” has recently appeared. The subject cannot
possibly be a dry one, but (without wishing to throw cold
water on the author) we are bound to say that we have
no particular thirst for the knowledge he undertakes to
impart. We fear that amid the Fountains of Europe
our own Mºlº, fountains must cut as sorry a figure
in history as they do in Trafalgar Square. We feel some
curiosity to know what an author can possibly say about
the Charing Cross fountain, and whether he is satisfied
with merely a glance at it—which is the case with every
one who sees it—or whether he traces its biography from
the cistern to the slop-basin, the cradle to the grave. The
historian of the Fountains of Europe, prefaces his work
with an essay on raising the water, but we are inclined to
think he would have a far more numerous body of readers
i he ºld offer a few hints on the possibility of raising
the wind.
SHAVING BY MACHINERY.
WE have tried every kind of shave at every variety of price, from
the shilling operation of the West End, to that most frightful of
tortures, “an easy shaye for a halfpenny,” in the New Cut, Lambeth.
We have been shaved by a drunkard, under whose “effacing fingers”
we have felt our beard bristling up with fear, “like quills upon the
fretful porcupine,” and we have been shaved by an aged individual
with the palsy, who has made sudden darts at us with the razor, and
ultimately triumphed over the difficulties that stared him in the face—
that is to say, in our own face—with a “bloodless victory.” We have
been shaved by a woman in Scotland; by an º in Shoreditch;
by a sailor on board ship in a storm; by ourselves in the dark; by a
schoolfellow, for fun; and § young beginners, for practice. In fact,
we have shown a sort of reckless audacity in getting rid of our beard,
that would have justified our enemies in saying that we have evinced a
wondrous amount of bold-faced effrontery. But, notwithstanding all
these perils which flesh is heir to, in having the hair removed from the
flesh, we should be afraid to patronise, or give our countenance to, a
certain new invention which is described in the following newspaper
paragraph:-
We must confess, that, however ingenious this machine may be, we
should feel very much in the same situation as the gentleman who was
deposited in the barrel of spikes, before we took our seat, amidst the
cylinders, with our face amºng a lot of razors, “four on each cylinder.”
As the cylinders are “fixed,” there can be no allowance for an extra
amount of cheek, an exuberance of lip, or protuberance of nose; but
when the “patient”—as he is very properly called—is once in for the
operation, he must take his chance as to the relative position of his
features, and the fixed razors, nor, must he think of being “nice to a
shaving.” When the “patient” takes his seat off goes the machine,
set in motion by his weight, and stoppage seems to be out of the
question until “he reaches, the ground, when the operation is com-
pleted.” No wonder that the patient should sink under an operation
of such very alarming gravity, by the law of which he comes to the
floor with a degree of force commensurate to the weight of his own
body. The seat, having released itself from its burden by shooting the
“patient” on to the floor, is ready for another victim. -
We should hardly like to be operated upon by a single razor with our
chair trembling beneath us; but to find ourselves amidst a “forest of
blades”—four on each cylinder—with our seat, giving way under us,

Wºly attempt appears to have been made to gloss over the more
alarming features of this infernal shaving machine, or, guillotine, by
setting it to music. . We hope the airs played by the box spoken of
are appropriate; and we should suggest the March in Blue Beard as
peculiarly fitted to a machine reminding one of beards and blood, of
soap and scimitars.

“Silaying by Machixºny-Mº. WILLIAM Johnson, of North Shields, Joiner, has
invented a shaving machine. This machine is of singular construction, and contains
every qualification necessary for the process. In appearance it is not unlike an old-
fashioned arm-chair. . But the most unique feature in the whole affair is the arrange-
ment of the razorblades, which are fixed longitudinally on cylinders, from three to
six inches in length, four on each cylinder, at an angle of 60 degrees, with fine camel-
hair brushes between; for you are lathered and shaved at one and the same time, the
lather being slipped from the interior of the cylinders, which are hollow. The machine
is put in motion by the weight of the patient, the seat gradually giving way beneath,
and sinking with him until he reaches the ground, when the operation is completed.
The seat, rising immediately it is released from his weight, is ready to commence
again without any preparation. A musical-box, of MR. Jonsson's construction, and
capable of performing a great variety of airs, is appended to the machine, and can

MEMORIAL TO BELLOT.
ONE noble heart the more hath Ocean stilled,
A heart that throbbed with brave humanity
And generous fortitude, which nothing chilled
É. the grim water of the frozen sea:
own to the deep, in doing well, went he.
No son of England—yet shall that be said,
Such kindred with the Hero as we claim?—
For we all mourna Brother in the Dead,
Although from France he drew his birth, and name;
Honour to France, increased by BELLot's fame.
Shall that ſame have no other monument
Than pile of toppling ice-crags for a tomb,
Afrostwork chantry, where, through cleft and rent,
The north wind sings his dirge, and sunless gloom
The Northern Lights are cressets to illume?
He died for England-so did one who might
Like him have perished, yet not so have died;
And when his spirit wakened into light,
NELson, perhaps, was first that welcome cried,
Remembering what like fate his youth defied.
But had the floe ingulfed that fearless boy
Chasing the sea-bear on its faithless track;
Our more than Hector—for he saved our Troy—
It then had been our º doom to lack:
And Valour, unrenowned, had gone to wrack.
Not so with him in glorious fight who fell,
For fellow-man, with elemental foes.
They for their native land who die, die well;
But better yet, more notably than those,
Died he who sank amid the Arctic snows.
His country was his kind-in noblest strife,
Whose victors only suffer—did he fall;
Thus did this gallant Tarjay down his life:
Rest his brave soul with such good sailors all,
Beneath the Flag of their High ADMIRAL!
The Way of Temperance.
“EnucATION” (says the Times) “is the half-way house to Tempe-
rancº.”. But, judging from the ignorant way in which many of our
rabid advocates of Teetotalism act and talk, we should say it was a
house that very few of them ever stopped at.

THE GOOSE CLUBS.
OUR eyes are again edified by the announcement so familiar to us...at
this season—“A Goose CLUB, HELD HERE.” We really should like
to have a set of the rules of one or more of these Clubs, for we are
puzzled to think what amount of goosedom can be a qualification for
membership...Surely the Peace Society people must be honorary
members for life of every Goose-Club in the kingdom, if merit has its
reward, and admittance to a Goose-Club is to be obtained by personal
gooseshness, or a corresponding amount of quackery. We have heard
that the manager of a certain highly patronised theatre has consulted
his solicitor upon the advertisement of a Goose-Club near Oxford Street,
with the yiew of ascertaining whether the word goose is, meant to
apply to himself in a libellous manner. The legal sage not being pre-
pared, the Goose question is in abeyance.

FORTUNE-TELLERS FOR NATIONS.
WHAT the Edinburgh Review—in a highly superior article on “Church Parties”
—calls the “Prophetic Press,” is now in a state of violent eruption. The volcano
in labour, however, brings fºrth only the bottle of smoke. You can hardly take
up your morning paper without being invited, in the ºf, columns, by
some half-dozen several expositors, to take so many new walks into futurity. e
Overthrow of the *ś. the Destruction of the Ottoman Empire, the Battle
of Armageddon, the ennium, demand *::::: attention together with the last
novel, and SoxER's Pantropheon, and the Propriety of Legalising Marriage with a
Wife's sister, it is a remarkable circumstance that the gentlemen who announce
these awful things, so calculated to wean the soul from all earthly solicitudes, do
not omit to affix prices to their productions. . Like common Gipsies, these reve-
rend Romany require their hands to be crossed with silver. This shows that whilst
they direct the attention of others to future certainties, they give no small share
of their own to the main chance. On that account we hesitate to compare
them to Mother SHIFTox, who was an old woman, or to Nixon, who was an
idiot. Otherwise we should regard them as common asses, pretending to rank
with the ass of BALAAM. - -

A PEACEFUL SOLICITOR.
A Guildford and guileless solicitor “and a Member of

War at no price! He says, the soldier, disobeys the law
of Christianity by killing a man. How about the attorney?
Does he obey the Christian law by helping to lock a man
up? As Christians, should we not be of charity and
forgiveness all compact? ...Does the solicitor make out his

MEssRs. Bass AND Co., the teetotallers will be glad to

Pale Ale Brewers, announcing the intention of raising the
price of their beer by 68, per cask. This concert among
the Brewers, with a Bºss for leader, exhibits some novelties
in harmony. The Bass rises instead of descending in the
scale of price, and by thus increasing in height, will,
strange to say, reach up to Double Bass. One more step
will raise it to Treble Bass; but that will be a contra-
diction in terms, and absolutely ridiculous.

our TourisT IN PARIS.–No. 10.
if there is a point upon which an Englishman can dwell with pride,
it is the high character of the English press. He will never be more
impressed with this than when he turns over the French, journals and
examines the matter of which they are made up.. A little, foreign
litics, Paris scandal, theatrical criticism, and a º: of a vile novel.
#. taking up the Times and finding, instead oft ree solid leading
articles, a portion of Jack Sheppard, or The Mysteries ºf the Court of
St. James's, the debates cut downto an analysis, and no home, or foreign
correspondence! The change would hardly be made agreeable to him
by the fact that the milk-and-water or poisonous contributions that did
appear were guaranteed by the name of the author of each, and that its
only polemics were waged by some individual SMITH, eo nomine, against
some individual Brown of another paper. Yet this precaution against
libel is recommended by a Fº person (I, was nearly saying a
statesman), who is “by way of being” a patriot, but wants tº have a
monopoly of influence and vituperation in his own hands. However
it is happily not of the least consequence what that disinterested
politician wants, for he certainly will not get it, as we cannot afford to
part with our Fourth Estate just yet, and suspect the motives of any
one who advises us to do so. - - - - ...
The Tourist makes these reflections with a little bitterness as he sits
in a café waiting for breakfast. A beautiful lady, with a ravishing little

diment in his French, who has ultimateŽ succeeded in ordering a
chop de mutton, and ºne bottel de Stout de Dublin, solacing himself

Until he read M. MERY's English sketches, he was ignorant, and he
boldly affirms that many others are ignorant too, of such common facts
as that English gentlemen hire post-captains in the Royal Navy to sail
their yachts; that Greenwich hospitalis a retreat for old soldiers; and
that the late Duke QF WELLINGTON, when ColoneLWELLEsley, was
Governor-General of India. He has selected one feuilleton, entitled
“SIR John Bull & Paris,” for its º exposure of British foibles.

nation. When man has done his utmost for his own safety, then is the time to invoke
the blessing of Heaven to give effect to his exertions.”
Surely, this is very true. Prayers, however, earnest, will not sweeten
a common sewer. Folks who fast for a long day will hardly do as

MARRIAGE RITES IN HIGH LIFE.
(From the Morning Herald.)
THE long talked of espousals of Lord Julius FitzMARLINGSPIKE
and the lovely and accomplished Rosa Augusta, * daughter of
his Grace the Duke of Bopps, have at length cºme off. Some delay
was occasioned by the gentlemen of the long robe, but the Spoºsalia
having been finally perused and settled by the eminent barrister CHBY-
sosrow Silvertosque, Q.C., were engrossed on the Legitima Tabella,
and were sealed on Wobºs's day last. Loºp, Julius took the oppor-
tunity of º: his betrothed with a splendid Annulus Prønuºus
of diamonds alternating with emeralds, expressly manufactured by the
talented jewellers, Rust and Hoskell. There was a difficulty in fixing
the marriage day, there being so many unlucky days, and Atri, in this
month's kalendar, and Salii and the Parentalia festivals approaching,
But łº, having been selected, the lovely bride was dressed
in a long white robe bordered with purple fringe, or embrºidered
ribbons (we could hardly say which), bound with 'a girdle of wool,
and tied, of course, with the time-honoured Nodus Hercºleus.
Her face was covered with a flame-coloured veil, denoting modesty,
and her beautiful hair having been divided into six.locks, with the
point of a spear (kindly lent from the New Zealand Museum),
was crowned with flowers supplied from a well-knºwn bouquetière
in Covent Garden. Her shoes were qf the same colour as her veil.
The auspices had been duly consulted, and a very fine * having
been sacrificed to Juno (the animal was supplied from the long-
established styes of Messrs. CHITTERLINGs Asſºco), the omens from
its inside were pronounced very favourable. We must not omit to
record a bon not of the bride, which, shows that she possesses all the
wit for which her spirituel family has been so long celebrated. Qn
the question at the espousals being put to her, “An spondes?” she
instantly replied, with an arch smile, “Spondeo, sed momen meum ºn
est Anne.” The marriage ceremony was performed at the house of the
Duke of Bopps, but in the evening the bride was conducted, tº her
husband's domus. Three boys, whose parents were alive, attended her,
two holding her by the arms, and one flourishing a fink which we
regret was made the subject of ribald remark by the other boys in the
street. The maid-servants followed with distaff, spindle, and wool, and
a boy from the Lowther Arcade bore the playthings: the crºpundia-for
the family with which it is to be hoped Rosa will be blessed. The
boys let of more than usually good sales et couvicia, which is accounted
for by Mr. Punch having kindly undertaken to supply the jokes for the
day. On arriving in Park Lane, the house of LºRD FITZMARLINGSPIKE
was found tastefully adorned with leaves and flºwers, and the rooms

practice of humanity to-
wards an unfortunate and
degraded class of beings.
Witness the New York
Journal of Commerce,
which contains the sub-
joined paragraph:—
"MARKING Convicts.-A re-
solution has been introduced
into the Kentucky Legislature,
which provides' that the keeper
of the Penitentiary shall pro-
cure a suitable chymical dye,
such as shall stain the cuticle
or outer surface of the skin
º: black, so that it cannot
washed off, or in any way
removed until time shall wear
it away, and Nature furnish a
new cuticle or surface; and that
with this dye he shall have the
nose of each male convict
painted thoroughly black, and
renew the application as often
as it may be necessary to keep
it so until within one month of
the expiration of his sentence,
when it shall be discontinued
for the purpose of permitting
Nature to restore the feature to its original hue preparatory to the second advent
of its owner into the world.'"
It has long been the reproach of America that she has one law for
the blacks, and another fºr the whites. . This is in one sense the case
in Kentucky; but there the advantage is on the side of the blacks. It

A THEATRICAL TITLES BILL WANTED.
We have had an Ecclesiastical Titles' Bill to prevent things from
being called by any but their right names; and we are now about to
suggest the passing of a Theatrical Titles' Bill, with the view of putting
a stop to an assumption of certain high-sounding styles and dignities in
the dramatic world, which are becoming offensive to the common, sense
of our countrymen. “His Eminence,” as applied, to CARRINAI, Wise:
MAN, may be ridiculous enough, but it is even still more absurd, when
usurped as it is, by a number of so-called “eminent” tragedians.
There is scarcely a theatrical hole or corner in London that does, not
advertise its possession of the services of some “eminent” individual
whose "mummeries” are quite as objectionable as those complained 9
in the Popish priesthood. We suspect, however, that some of the
objectionable titles are conferred on the parties without their own
consent; and we feel convinced that our honest friend,. MR. JoHN
Coor ER—the comic representative of Henry the Eighth, and the
original Rumps in Turning the Tables—can never have given his adhe-
sion to the bigotry and superstition of Exeter Hall, whose concert
conductors have advertised him as the “eminent tragedian.”

NOBLE CONDUCT OF MESSRS. COBDEN AND BRIGHT.
HAVING recently had a slight corvine plucking with MR. CoBDEN and
MR; BRight, Mr. Punch has the more, pleasure in bearing testimony to their
noble conduct in reference to the strike disturbances at Wigan. - - -
As soon as MR. CopDEN was informed of these painful outbreaks, he laid aside a
pamphlet which he is writing, to prove that Russia never, went to war with
anybody, and he hurried off to MR. BRIGHT. He found the latter busily arranging
the library which has recently been presented to him for his anti-Corn. Law
exertions; and that gentleman, hastily dashing down a fine copy of “Boriana,”
which he was reading with great zest, got into his friend's º:
“I think,” said MR. CoBDEN, with one of his frank smiles, “that...we, who have
shown that everything can be arranged by, diplomacy, have assailed everybody
for not settling differences by arbitration, and have so often vaunted the superiority
of the cultivated town operative over the agricultural dolt, would hardly like to
be accused of allowing thousands of our own disciples to rise in riot close to our
own doors, without interfering and arguing with them.”
“By Jove –I mean yerily,” said, MR. BRIGHT, nearly smashing the carriage
window in his energy, “I should like any dastard to say that Isneaked out of
such an affray.”
The missionaries of peace and political economy went pleasantly on, reached
Wigan, had the military sent away, and convoked the populace. MR. Cofiden then
explained to the rioters that a #. of wages was not to be settled by violence,
and invited them to a peaceful discussion; and MR. BRIGHT, in the kindest

King. AAERDEEN's a great statesman. That is, he's great in his
respectability. And the English-I know the noble islanders—the
English are so devoted to a respectable Minister, that they’d rather
be half-ruined by respectability, than saved and served by anything
that’s brilliant. They fear brilliancy, as it is said JAMEs the FIRST
winced at a drawn sword.
Prince. To be sure, PALMERSTON.—
King. A firebrand, mon_cher; but now excellently disposed of.
However, for the peace of Europe—
Prince. Mark! [Fires; bird falls.]
. King{{ dogs). Down charge! . But for the peace of Europe PAM
is capitally placed. It is all §§ to have a firebrand in the Home
Qffice, so long as you keep a Wet Blanket in the first place of the
asury.
. Prince. Peace is certainly to be desired. You have not seen my
picture—an allegory of Peace?
King. I have. showed it me yesterday. My dear ALBERT,
do let me have a copy—may two copies, by your own hand; one for
Austria, one for Russia; they will be delighted. Such “material
guarantees” for the peace of Europe; and peace at any price will be
cheaper than ever. -
Prince. ABERDEEN deplores war. IIe said at the Council on Tuesday,
when MoLEsworth talked about national honour, and shedding blood,
and all that—he said : It is better to have your nose pulled, than your
nose cut off. , Now England has certainly had its nose pulled—
King. But has not lost an inch of it. The nose is quite as good as
ever, and then—
Prince. Down, Pompey ! How wild the dogs are

Therefore, why not let Russia keep the Provinces, and—

IN EAST AND NORTH.
Two sisters stand by Stamboul's sunny waters,
Two sisters sit where Arctic ice-winds rave—
Hands clasped, the first watch a fleet's crew at quarters;
Hands clasped, the second weep beside a grave.
The same two sisters;–long upon each other,
Stern have they frowned across their Channel sea:
But now all rivalries and hates they smother,
And sit thus, hand in hand laid lovingly.
Why, sisters, rest ye thus at peace together,
Your ancient feuds and factions all laid by ?—
Why smile you in that purple Asian weather?
Why weep you 'neath that leaden Polar sky?
“Two causes, stranger, hold us thus united—
Both fit to make true friends of noble foes:
In the bright East we stand to see wrong righted,
In the black North, a hero's eyes we close.
“Those battle flags that side by side are swelling
Speak of brute force defied, of law maintained,
Those funeral flags that side by side are trailing,
Speak both of loss endured and triumph gained.
“Yon banded fleet to all the nations teaches
He that doth wrong his wrong shall sore abye;
The icy monument of BELLOT preaches
How nobly love can live, how grandly faith can die.
“Are not these lessons worthy of the giving
To give them is 't not well we use our might 2
Then leave us to our gladness and our grieving,
Under the Eastern sum, beneath the Polar night.”

CHINESE HUMANITY.
THE Chinese Imperial general offered to his soldiers two dollars a
head—the head duly cut off–of the enemy. Well, the enemy not
forthcoming, the nt soldiers took off the heads of their friends.
The heads becoming cumbrous from their number, the general declared
that he would be sufficiently satisfied with the instalment of ears.
Whereupon the gallant Chinese accosted the villagers, men and women
in Shaksperian utterance – “Lend us your ears,” and they granted
the loan as security for their head.
Epitaph on a Plucked Man.
His Pluckings sore long time he bore,
But PALEY was in vain; -
At length, disgusted, he took and “cussed” it,
And didn't try again.

A CLOSE CONTRIVANCE AT WINCHESTER I
\\\/22 - LD Winchester — as
I- most people know, and
T º SNAEARº- the rest may have

º | |º owls, and, bats – in:
Jººl º fested with rats and
º
wº mice; stupid, crawl-
ing, disagreeable and
voracious creatures.
Winchester Cathedral, how-
ever, rejoices under the guard:
ianship of a body of divines of
whom it may fearlessly be asserted
that they neitherhoot nor squeak,
nor fly on any wings but those
of devotion, nor offend the ex-
ternal senses, nor nibble to any
extent that is uncapitular.
Some Chapters—the excellent
DEAN or WINCHESTER is stricken
in years, and for the present
management of the affairs of the
Cathedral, renown and honour are probably due altogether to his subordinates–
some lazy indifferent Chapters, content themselves with keeping, the glorious
buildings bequeathed to them by the great churchmen of the Middle Ages in simple
repair. This may, indeed, include of namental restorations. But here they stop.
Averse to progress, these prebendal sloths do nothing whatever to improve their
cathedrals, by alterations and embellishments in accordance with the feelings and
wants of the age.
Sluggish indifference like this is not to be cast in the teeth of those high-minded
and liberal clergymen, the Chapter of Winchester...We are informed that they
have lately enriched the interior of that majestic edifice with additional features
which, whilst subservient to utility, have, at the same time, the high ºsthetica
merit of embodying, or symbolising the canonical ... of the nineteenth century.
Double rows of iron, hurdles, surmounted by cheraur-de-frise, have been placed
by these magnanimous dignitaries across the aisles of the Cathedral.
... We are sorry to say that a correspondent, writing from Winchester, is so
disrespectful as to suggest a motive for the erection of these barriers of a nature
unclerical, if not unworthy. He supposes that the reverend gentry of the Close
have taken to . and as neither custom, nor the agriculturists to whom the
meadows belong, wo § allow them to ride steeplechases in the valley of the Itchen,
they have set up “bullfinchers” within their own bounds, in order to prosecute
the chase of the steeple within the church.
PUNCH THE ONLY RECOGNISED PROMOTER OF LITERATURE.
. A wholesoxſº caution has just been administered to self-styled Literary Institu-
tions, which claim exemption from Poor Rate by the assumption of a title which
they do not carry out. At the Bath Quarter Š. a set of persons calling
themselves the Bath Literary and Scientific Institution, had the effrontery to
make a claim to freedom from taxation; and on the question being put to one
of the witnesses—"Is Punch taken in at the Institution?” the reply was in the
negative. This of course settled the point as to the Society being one for the
advancement of literature; and the Sessions instantly decided against the claim.
We hope Literary Societies in general will take a note of this important decision,
which lays it down, on legal authority, that the taking in of Punch is satisfactory
evidence of an intention to promote literature. e Bath chaps who sought
exemption on insufficient grounds, have received a lesson which we trust will
not be lost on those who fail to “mind their Punch,” and who fancy themselves
promoters of literature, without †. themselves by that test which is now
recognised by a legal tribunal as decisive, and will, we hope, find its way into “the
Books” as soon as possible.
The City Coaxing the Crown.
Those renowned gourmands, the Corporation of the City of London, have got up
a new dish, in the hope that it may prove a “pretty dish to set before the QUEEN;”
adulation dished up as a sort of ourry or attempt at currying of favour with an
illustrious Prince. By their proposal to erect a statue to PRINCE ALBERT during
his lifetime, they will not, however, succeed in the scheme of cajoling the Crown
to interfere between their corruptions and reform; and the meal they propose
for the acceptance of His Royal Highness will prove a mess. They had better
relinquish their endeavours to add lustre to the reputation of the Prince, and
transfer their attention to his boots.
A LETTER AND AN ANSWER.
The PRESBYTERs to PALMERSTON.
The Plague has come among us,
iserable sinners'
Fear and remorse have stung us,
Miserable sinners!
We ask the State to fix a day
Whereon all men may fast and pray,
That Heaven will please to turn away
The Plague that works us sore dismay.
Miserable sinners!
PALMERston to the PRESBYTERs.
The Plague that comes among you,
Miserable sinners
To effort hath it strung you?
Miserable sinners!
You ask that all should fast and pray;
Better all wake and work, I say;
Sloth and º put away,
That so the Plague may cease to slay;
Miserable sinners!
For Plagues like other evils,
Miserable sinners!
Are GoD's and not the Devil's,
Miserable sinners!
Scourges they are, but in a hand
Which love and pity do command;
And when the heaviest stripes do fall
'Tis where they’re wanted most of all,
Miserable sinners!
Look round about your city,
Miserable sinners!
Arouse to shame and pity,
Miserable sinners.!
Pray: but use brush and limewash pail;
Fast: but feed those for want who fail;
Bow down, gude town, to ask for grace,
Hulbow with cleaner hands and face,
Miserable sinners!
All Time God's Law hath spoken,
Miserable sinners!
That Law may not be broken,
Miserable sinners'
But he that breaks it must endure
The penalty which works the cure.
To us, for GoD's great laws transgressed,
Is doomsman Pestilence addressed,
Miserable sinners'
We cannot juggle Heaven,
Miserable sinners!
With one day out of seven,
Miserable sinners'
Shall any force of fasts atone
For years of duty left undone *
How expiate with prayer or psalm,
Deaf ear, blind eye, and folded palm ?
Miserable sinners!
Let us be up and stirring,
Miserable sinners!
'Mongst ignorant and erring,
Miserable sinners'
Sloth and self-seeking from us cast,
Believing this the fittest fast,
For of all prayers prayed 'neath the sun
There is no prayer like work well done,
Miserable sinners'
Golden Bullets.
LAST week news arrived from Santa Fé of a tribe of

INGENIOUS PROTECTION AGAINST MIDGES-A VALUABLE HINT TO
SKETCHERS FROM NATURE.
A REGULA R N U 1 SAN CE.
MR. PUNCH has long ago been º by and under his own act, Inspector-General of
Nuisances, and he may certainly take credit }. the removal of a great many nuisances long
before the legislature gave its attention to the subject. -
Mr. Punch has lately been engaged in the inspection of the great City of London
Corporation Nuisance, and refers to the annexed report for the result of his observations:
REPORT.
My attention was first drawn to the Corporation Nuisance by the very bad odour
surrounding the locality, and by a very general rumour that an offensive bºdy, in a most
alarming state of corruption, was lying within the precincts of the City of London. . .
I accordingly proceeded to visit the spot, where a lamentable scene presented itself. I
found some four-and-twenty individuals huddled, or, rather, closeted together, in one room,
surrounded º a quantity of refuse vegetable and animal matter (apparently composed of
ine-apple an yº the effluvium from which was of the most deleterious character.
n examining further, I found a large quantity of thick fluid, in the midst of which were
several portions of a glutinous green turtley material, and over the surface a sort of, coatin
had formed, which might almost be cut with a knife—so thick was the matter that ha
settled on the top of the stagnant liquid. This deleterious wash had been placed in
vessels resembling soup-tureens, and was no doubt intended for removal, a great deal of it
having been already got rid of by the persons assembled in the room, who appear, however,
-
to have been unable to proceed further with
their disgusting, operation, I found them in a
state of considerable exhaustion among the
| refuse stuff, and there can be no doubt that the
|ºnditiºn in which they are living is highly in-
jurious to the health—moral as well as physical
|-and likely to exercise, a most contaminating
| influence on the surrounding atmosphere.
|. In pursuance of this report Mr. Punch feels it
|his, duty to order the removal of the nuisance
within a reasonable time, for the parties have
been so frcſ * warned that there is little
hope they º: of themselves proceed to abate the
evils that have solong been matter of public moto-
|riety. , Mr. Punch intends proceeding to inspect
other departments of the great City of London
Corporation Nuisance, and to persevere until a
clean bill of health can be presented.
ARISTOCRACY AND ITS ANTIPODES,
If the Legislative Council of New South
Wales are cnabled to effect their proposal for the
creation of an hereditary Peerage in that colony,
it will be necessary to assign armorial bearin
to the new noblemen. This will be no very diffi:
cult matter; respect being had to the origin of
thc chief families that will be comprised in that
aristocracy. For example, here is the blazon of a
coat that might be borne by the name of Sikes,
elevated to the Dukedom of Norfolk Island.
Gules, on a cross ermine, between four hand-
cuffs, or, a jemmy of the field. Crest, out of a
window'shutter rerº a hand, sable, grasping a
centre-bit proper. .
The above coat will readily be seen to indicate
that the founder of the bearer's family had been
transported for burglary accompanied by violence:
The latter feature of his achievements is denoted
by the sanguinary colour of the field, and of the
implement depicted on the centre of the scut-
cheon. By the number of the handcuffs are sig-
nified two convictions. The cross alludes to
crossing the herring-pond, and the ermine indi-
cates the judicial sentence by which the lº.
was prescribed. The crest speaks for itself; the
use of the term sable is an allowable liberty, as
being necessary to represent the probable sate
of the member to which it is applied, considered
in relation to soap and water. }. family motto
might be, Mortuus vivo, which would be a neat
paraphrase of “Death Recorded.”
The horse, the sheep, the pig, and other cattle
—for stealing which the forefathers of the en
nobled parties were relegated—would furnish
abundance of animal forms for the purposes of
heraldic symbolism. To these might be added
the magpie, the stoat, the weasel, and other crea-
tures that are the emblems of theft and larceny.
Though, for the matter of that, the more ancient
devices of eagles, dragons, griffins, liºns, and the
like beasts and birds of prey, would do quite suf:
ficiently well to glorify exploits of plunder and
rapine; nor coul º for the member of a
Botany Bay nobility be more suitable than some
of those very professions of ancestral principle,
which are the glory of certain high pedigrees
among ourselves. “Thou shal want ere I want,”
for instance, would precisely suit the descendant
of a footpad. A convict who had become a pros-
perous gentleman, after having completed his
sentence of transportation for seven years, could
not have left a happier legend to his posterity,
than “I bide my time.” Moreover, when it is
considered that the foundation of not a few
among our own great houses was either fraud or
force, it cannot be asserted that a Peerage of
New South Wales would not rest to a consider-
able extent on a like basis with the British, no-
bility. So that, when you come to think it, there
may not be so very much difference, after all,
between those who came in with the Conqueror,
and those who went out in the convict ship.

DINNERS AT NEWGATE.
HE Sessions of the Central Crim-
inal Court have lost much of their
L attraction—especially to a hungry
Old Bailey Bar, some of whom
are dreadfully open-mouthed—by
the cutting down of the dinners
usually given by the Sheriffs. It
seems that the learned Judges
have not as yet had any dinner at
all in the City, but have been
obliged to be satisfied with , a
rather substantial “lunch,” by
way of substitute. . The two
Sheriffs have been at loggerheads,
and one of them—Mr. WALLIs
—has provided a meal to which
he has invited only the Aldermen
on the rota instead of the whole
body; upon which SHERIFF WIRE
fearing ſest his brother Aldermen
should starve, has started an oppo-
sition table. In the mean time
the Judges have been making a
meagre lunch with one Sheriff and
dining with neither. There being
- however, two lunches a day, and
- two opposition dinners, we should
be glad to know how the worthy Chaplain of Newgate performs his
elaborate duty of partaking of every meal, which he mus necessarily
THE SHERIFFS”
do, in order to avoid giving offence to either of the oppositiºn Sheriffs;|N
The reverend ordinary wilfhave the extraordinary task of disposing of
two lunches and two dinners in four-and-twenty hºurs-all accomplish-
ment that calls to mind the old familiar feat of the leg of mutton and
trimmings. - - - -
The name of “ordinary” is most appropriately given to the worthy
Chaplain, who by yirtue of his office is present at the ordinary at
one, the other ordinary at five, and again at the two extra-ordinaries
occasioned by the division between the two. Sheriffs. It appears that
in the midst of all this superabundance the learned.Judges, huſſed
at having received their invitations from one Sheriff instead ºf two,
have preferred going dinnerless; wisely, however, hesitating to abandoa
themselves, to hopeless hunger, they have made a compromise with
their dignity by condescending to “lunch” at the table of SHERIFF
WALLIs. - -
We confess we should be glad to see the practice of Old Bailey
dinners getting abandoned altogether, so that the old sarcasm as to
"wretches hanging that Judges may dine,” may for, ever lose its
traditional point, as it has long ago lost its practical, application,
There is something unpleasantly anomalous in the substitution of
the table-mapkin for the ermine before quitting the Court, and, it is not
a pleasant reflection, that the prisoners having been, awarded their
#. the Judges will, under the same roof, proceed to take their
Inllets.
THE JUDGES” CHAMBERS.
Oh such a row, such a rumpus and a bobbery,
Everything and every one quite in the dark;
No one knows the order of the Summonses,
Fixed to be heard by MR. BARON PARKE:
Tearing, swearing,
For dignity not caring,
Common lawyers, clerks of all sorts, down to office drudge.
Never was a rougher set of noisy individuals,
Hanging round the chamber doors to go before the Judge.
A French Feast of the Poets.
. BERANGER the poet is, we are told by the paragraph-mongers, con-
tinually receiving presents of jam from his enthusiastic countrymen.
We regret to say that our own, poets meet with no such sweets,
and fre º pass a life of unmitigated bitters. Instead of presents
of º: et the reader prepare to be knocked down by a fearful
blow to his common sense)—we repeat—instead of presents of jam our
poets too often meet with a geli
- indifference—jam and gelid: does
the reader see what we are aiming at?
A FAIRY WIsh.
OH, that the million million million billions of seeds of corn rotting
on the Danube were “corned' into gunpowder, and swallowed by
Nicholas. Having no bowels, how could it hurt him?
PLATO'S REPUBLIC PERFECT.
The City's the Model Republic of PLATO,
like as potato can be to potato,
Save in one point alone; and it would be a pity
If that difference did not distinguish the City.
In PLATO's . all good things combining,
That serve to the great ends of drinking and dining,
No Poet was suffered his metres to mingle
With the clatter of plates, and the wine glasses' jingle.
But London's good § a poet possesses
Who sings its high deeds and its glory expresses,
And graces its banquets, his brows bound with myrtle,
Sucking up inspiration together with turtle.
That Poet—whose aim is existence to sweeten—
Next day sings the praises of what he has eaten,
Which by wholesale are bought by the rich Corporation
As the fairest account of the jollification.
At eighty-five, Fleet Street, this son of Apollo
Indites, each November, the Song of the Swallow;
His muse every bookseller's counter encumbers,
But his friends in the City buy up all his numbers.
HOW EUROPE MAY BE SAVED !
* from a Neapolitan pen, authorized by KING BoMBA, of
apies :
“Take the English people, strip 'em, rob 'em, kick 'em out of
* making of 'em—even as the Hebrews-dealers in hare skins
and old clothes. When this is done, take London, and turn it topsy-
turyy, ruinous like Jerusalem I. Let the English House of Commons
sit by the waters of the Danube and weep; and let English Bishops
sell maccaroni, and English merchants yend water-melons to the Laz-
zaroni of Nº. Then Europe will be safe. When the House of
Hanover is placed, upon, a cinder-heap of Mount Vesuvius, then may
Europe, in the depths of her º sweetly rejoice!” -
And the KING of NAPLEs read the foregoing, and said “Let it be
forthwith printed, and let BRITANNLA forthwith prepare herself to
become a Jewess.” Only to think—the British Lion a Lion of Judah!

MR. PUNCH sings.
OUR future Premier, laughing free, I’ve got my eye upon,
I think you’ll all agree with me—his name is P-LM-Rston.
And by his side sits sleepily a lord in Scotland bred;
I think you’ll all agree with me—that he were best in bed.

O yes, we all agree with you that he were best in bed.
Some Lights that want Snuffing Out.
A New religious book is now being advertised under the illuminating
title of “The Lamp and the Lantern, a Light for the Tent and the

CRUEL KING CoAL over London town
Evermore year by year doth reign;
He is dight in a rich and goodly gown,
And he sporteth a monstrous golden chain.
CRUEL KING CoAL doth his greatness air
In a flaming coach of state reclined;
And before him the Macc and Sword they bear,
And the little boys run and shout behind.
How did it happen to this KING CoAL
That he came to be called by the name of Crucl?
"Twas because the old tyrant cribbed and stole,
By his cunning contrivance, poor men's fuel.
Cruel KING CoAL and his merry men,
Twenty and five fat rogues were they,
Cabbaged fourpence a chaldron first, then ten,
And a penny to boot made poor folks pay.
Measuring that which they never mete
Making good losses themselves should stand,
And rebuilding here and there a street,
Were the pretexts alleged by the worthy band.
Even the load that a donkey draws,
These fellows do tax, and tithe, and toll,
Twenty miles around fondon Town; by laws
Through Parliament slipped by sly KiNg CoAL.
Picking and filching, this cruel King
First on all coals that were sea-borne preyed;
Next upon such as canal did bring,
Then on those by QUEEN’s highway and rail conveyed.
Twenty fair miles as the road did wind,
He levied the tax in time gone by ;
But the Commons his art ...Yto blind,
And the distance is now as crow doth fly.
Drawback His Majesty granteth not
Twenty good tons on a weight below;
And the boiling of every humble pot
The old fellow doth render the dearer so.
Cruel KING CoAL doth feed and stuff,
Revel and riot in each man's scuttle;
Eat and drink when he’s more than full enough,
Cram, guzzle, and gorge, and swill, and guttle.
Cruel KING CoAL shall we suffer more
To blow himself out by extortion dire?
Shall we let him continue to starve the poor
By the tax that he takes from their bit of fire?

PALMERSTON'S NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.
SINCE LoRD PALMERsroN said, in his speech at Perth, that he was
always #. to receive suggestions, and to read the correspondence
that individuals might favour him with, he has been overwhelmed with
letters upon all imaginable and unimaginable subjects. . The conse-
quence is he has been obliged to employ three additional secretaries,
who are engaged night, and day answering the stupid questions that
are put to him. The º; may be relied upon as a fair sample of
the nonsensical inquiries he is favoured with:—
Lataxia-You are right. There is no doubt that there is a little settlement to be found
in all Ports—but this does not apply to the Sublime Porte; for in spite of all the
shaking and stirring it has lately received, I cannot see the smallest hope of a
settlement.
Rosa Matilda-You ask me, my young lady, what is the best ink for writing love-
letters with? I am sorry I cannot inform you, as it is now many years ago, in con-
sequence of the graver cares of office, since I have abandoned the foolish practice.
Thespis.--It is more than I can tell you what kind of Brooke has caused Drury Lane
to overflow every night. I have not been to the theatre this season, and so I cannot
inform you whether the Brooke in question was deep, or merely a shallow Baooke,
or a roaring BRooke, or in fact what particular kind of Baooke it was; but from
all the reports I have heard, some of which have been very loud, I should hardly say
it was “the murmuring Baooke.”
Dºnnett—I cannot tell you Lond Bhough AM's habitual residence; but, looking at his
trousers, I should say it was generally on the other side of the Tweed.
ONE who is rowd or Digging rom Roots-I should say, from your foolish question,
that the place where you dig most must be a garden full of simples. How can I say
whether “toggery" is derived from the Latin word toga? Or whether Clytem-
NESTRA, when she was on the point of stabbing her son, exclaimed “Au Rester" or
whether a cross-examination is so called, because it generally has the effect of
making a person “cross?" I wonder you are not ashamed of yourself putting such
insipid questions to one of Hen Mauesty's Ministers.
A Public Jourts ALIST-Lond PALMºnston is extremely sorry he cannot give the
name of the “Old Woman who lived in a shoe,” and he doubts very strongly in his
own mind if any old woman ever chose such a curious locality for a habitation.
Perhaps-and this is merely thrown out as a conjecture—it may refer to Mrs. GAMP,
of the Morning Herald, and who lives in Shoe Lane; but then the song should run,
“There was an old woman, who lived in Shoe Lane,” and unfortunately it doesn't.
Honticultunist.—The apple of discord was doubtlessly, my dear, a crab-apple; but it
is beyond me to say whether VENUs, in accepting it, was a naughty-culturist; but I
can only say, from my own experience, that it is not the first time by many that
Paris has been the cause of throwing the apple of discord—witness the Spanish
Marriage.
“ET Tu Quoque."—It would ill become me, in my position, to offer any opinion upon
the condyct of a fellow-colleague, so you must excuseme i. I decline answering your
inquiry whether Lond ABERDEEN is not “the injudicious bottle-holder of the Porte.”
I should be sorry to accept a compliment at the expense of a man whom I so highly
—but never mind the rest.
FIDDLE-DE-DEE-I will write to Lond WesTMoRELAND at the earliest opportunity to
inquire whether he is composing variations on the tune of “Pop Goes the Weasel,”
but I doubt it extremely. Your other question of whether a man who gives his
mind to a violin can be a clever ambassador, I decline answering.
“That's the Way THE Monev Goes.”—You ask me—why I don't know—the reason
why “tin” should be the vulgar synonym for money. It defies my powers of divina-
tion to tell you, unless it originated from the fact of the purses which are thrown
away upon the stage, and which generally contain from ten thousand ducats to a
* º thousand pounds, being always filled with pieces of tin. Hence probably
e synonym.
ONE who DABBLEs. IN INR.—I do not mind telling you in confidence that Load
Bnougham is not the Editor of the Family Herald.

chaps off your lips is to wear a respirator.
THE HIGH-METTLED RAZOR.
AIR-" See the course throng'd with gazers, the sports are begun.”—C. Dippin.
SINCE of course we want razors when manhood’s begun,
Lest profusion of beard should our faces o'errun,
A thousand strange methods are found every year,
And Mechi and RodgeRs assail our young ear.
When we next, like a vain beau, direct that our crest,
Silver mounted, should be on the handle impressed,
Scarcely scraping a hair in our downy estate,
The High-Mettled Razor first ranks among plate.
The next ten years turn out, and we need not now blush,
To be caught when we’re soaping our beard with a brush;
For we have one at length, and we need not say may,
Should any one ask if we shaye every day. .
While alike born for scrapes in our life's daily course,
Always sure to come through with a cut, if not worse; .
When we’re barely shaved down just to what Fashion saith,
The High-Mettled Razor now bores us to death.
Grown rusty, used up, and turned dull as a spud,
Notched, blunted, and, always when used, drawing blood;
While, knowing his past deeds, his misdeeds we trace,
Tell, “this notch cut my finger, and this cut my face;”
And what dangers we’ve run, we could quickly count o'er,
As we wasted our time, and our temper, and gore;
When the § doth gall, and the steel our chins goad,
The High-Mettled Razor's put out of the road.
At length they’ve improved it, before 'tis too late,
cHI and Rodgers must bend to their fate,
And barbers will soon have to work the tread-mill,
If their razors are brought to a daily stand still.
For now, with its works nearly hid from our view,
In the very same chair in which we must sit too,
While a music-box plays like a musical elf,
The High-Mettled Razor doth share us itself!

LORD SID-NEE'S SHOW.
The Ardent Lover, CHING-BANG-BUNG, at present residing among the island Barbarians, writes to the Star of his Brain, LoLLUM SQUINNYI,
daughter ºf HANGo JowdoB, wealthy merchant of Tseen-ki, with a wart on his nose.
“MoonLIGHT ON THE WATERs of My SouL,
“Adoring your silver slipper with its buckle of emeralds,
profoundly respecting the gilded toad which lies before your cerulean
door in the light of a scraper, nay, venerating the marble slab that
forms the threshold of the house where lives the angelic daughter of
HANGo JowdoB with the wart on his nose, I send you this
illuminated rescript. Honour it.
“Yesterday, O LoLLUM, was a festival among these barbarians, and
the Chief Magistrate of their chief city went in procession to swear
oaths, and to bid other judges to devour sea-tortoises with him. A
scribe named Punch, and altogether the wisest and comeliest man I
have ever seen (excepting HANgo JowdoB, with the wart on his nose,
who will º read hiº, gave me a seat in his mansion, which
overlooketh the highway. By CoN-FU-zee, O Lollu M, but these
barbarians have something in them, after all. Their Čhief Magistrate
is a vendor of teas, and the array was got up to remind the spec-
tators of the Flowery Land whence cometh the fragrant leaf; in
short, it was a gorgeous advertisement of his profession.
cº ºf example from the wisest nation of earth, they have
sought to liken their procession unto what they deem to be eSC.
Poor . they make sad blunders; but our religion teaches us to
be charitable, and to pity rather, than ridicule the benighted heathens,
who have not a pagoda in their land, save a miserable one in some
gardens they call Q. Yesterday they exhibited strange mockeries of
our Chinese forms; but still the good will was there, and we will not
mock them in return, but try to teach them better.
“There were shields with faces, as of moons and devils, and dragon-
banners, with bells, and other imitations of us; but the artistic desi
and the classical execution were wanting, my LoLLUM. The Chief
Magistrate himself rode in a carriage formed like a gigantic tea-pot;
and before and behind him came standards, on which were emblazone
the º of his goods. Two huge idols, worshipped by the Fathers
of the City, with costly orgies, were borne along, with Chinese adorn-
ments; and numerous other devices reminded me of the land where
dwelleth the lovely daughter of HANGo JowdoB with the wart on his
nose.
“They are all traders, these barbarians, and one of the ancestors of
this Magistrate, whose name is SID-NEE, was a great layer of bricks, as
iſ gather, for he is often spoken of, by public-house orators, as
‘SID-NEE on the Scaffold.”
“LoLLUM of my Soul!. Light breaking in at the Chink of my
Heart! Violet of my Nostrils! Pickled Duck of my Affections! Water-
lily floating on the waves of my Life! Whitest Egg in the Nest of my
Brain! I worship your image, and I kiss, the rice-paper which enfolds
the eyelash you gave me at parting. When shall your eyes sparkle
into mine, and set, all the fireworks of my soul fizzing, and banging,
and sparkling? Eleven millions of highly polished compliments to the
respectable go JowdoB with the wart on his nose.

O MICKIE yeuks the keckle doup,
An' a' unsicker girns the graith,
For was and wae! the crowdies loup
O'er joukan' hallan, braw an' baith.'
Where ance the coggie hirpled fair,
And blithesome poortith toomed the loof,
There's nae a burnie giglet rare
But blaws in ilka jinking coof.
The routhie bield that gars the gear

And aye the stound is birkin lear
Where sconnered yowies wheeped yestreen.
The creeshierax wi' skelpin' kaes
Nae mair the howdie bicker whangs,
Nor weanies in their wee bit claes
Glour light as lammies wi' their sangs.
Yet leeze me on my bonnie byke!
My drappie aiblins blinks the noo,
An' leesome luve has lapt the dyke
Forgatherin' just a wee bit fou.
And Scotia!, while thyrantin' lunt

I’ll stowlins pit my unco brunt,
An' cleek my duds for auld lang syne.
PAYING SEHOT BEFORE BATTLE.
THE New Prussian Gazette of Berlin says:—
“Several Turkish and Wallachian merchants have arrived here to
pay their debts. This case several times occurred during the wars of
Turkey with a European power. Turks have come and paid their debts
at the risk of their lives in crossing through the enemy's camp."
When this paragraph was read upon 'Change, a melan-
choly, wan-loo .# man said with a sigh, “I don't wish an
harm to Her Catholic Majesty's Ministers; but I do º
that, if only to relieve us of our bonds, certain Spaniards
would, just for the occasion, become Mahometans.”
Certainly NARVAEz in a fez would create a sensation in
the City.
L-
THE KING OF THE CITY.
SoME new lights have been thrown on the position of the LoRD
MAYok by the evidence given before the Corporation Commission
which is now sitting. The LoRD MAYoR seems to be a mixture, of
degradation and dignity—a species of civic Centaur—a kind of neither
one thing nor the other, or rather a sort of both—a combination of the
flunkey and the potentate, which it would be difficult to analyse. At
the Mansion House dinner he is a Monarch, but at the Coronation
banquet he is a Butler, in virtue of which menial occupation he takes a
golden tankard home to clean, and then claiming it as a perquisite, he
never brings it back again. Why the Lord MAYoR should appropriate
a bit of the plate because he is acting as Butler, is as much a mystery
to us, as it would be if the man we paid to wait when we give a dinner-
party were to walk off with our best piece of plate—our sugar-tongs,
which are real, all the rest being electro—under the paltry subterfuge
of its being a “perquisite.” We can only say that if the Lord MAYOR
were to be stopped on his way from the Coronation banquet with, the
golden tankard in his pocket or under his arm, it would require nothing
short of theº. of the original charter, to satisfy the police that
he had lawf ssession of the property. -
It appears that the Lord MAYon is a Privy Councillor, but is
so completely cut in that capacity that he is never summoned to
attend, and the probability is, that if his Lordship were to present
himself for admission he would have the door shut in his face by the
“proper officers.” It is, however, inconvenient that those dignities
should nominally attach to an individual who is not permitted to use
them, and we can only compliment those who have held the office of
Lord MAyor on their good sense in not º an unseemly alter-
cation with the royal porters and door-keepers, by attempting to “get
in” when a Privy Council is sitting. There is no doubt that if “his
hip” were to force a passage up into the Council Chamber, and
attempt to take his seat at the Board, there would be a general cry of
“turn him out” from the Cabinet Members. The absurdity of the
situation is so apparent, and the incongruity of the Lord MAYon at
the Privy Council is so striking, that nobody, can doubt the propriety
jºins a nominal position, which only subjects its holder to
r1011cule.
. The only real power that is still exercised by the LoRD MAYOR is the
right of shutting up Temple Bar when the Sovereign is expected; but
since the side bar has been rented by a loyal hair-dresser, who would
assuredly let the monarch through his shop-if any serious obstacle were
to be offered by the civic authorities—it is high time that even this dim
branch of the civic !. were lopped off by the axe of Improve-
ment, that judicious woodsman, who spares nothing superfluous.
“REVENONS A NOS MOUTONS.”
The French, in a great victory over the Arabs, “have captured 4,000
sheep.” What will they do with these 4,000 prisoners of war? Will
º drive them to market, and sell them for what they will fetch, or
ill they turn them, into gigots and cotelettes ? Will they preserve
their fleeces as trophies, and hang them up in the Invalides? What
will they do with the tallow?"Will they meſ; it into candles, and send
them as altar-offerings to the Pope to solicit his blessing on their
Algerian campaigns? These questions are difficult to answer, and in
the meantime the poor sheep, recollecting the deeds of BUGEAUD and
PELIssier, must tremble in their skins every time they see the steel of
the Frenchmen. For ourselves, we believe the lives of the 4,000 sheep
will be spared by the French, out of their noble anxiety to prove to
Europe that warfare can be carried on in Algeria without butchery.
Mute Eloquence.
SoMERopy has brought out a collection of the “Songs of Scotland
without Words.” In order to render the thing º agreeable,
we would propose that the songs without words should be set to bag-
pipes without sound, and sung by performers without voices.

an inflated aspect, bestriding the loaf in a military uniform and a pair
of jack-boots. So that now, in almost all families, when any st
noise is heard about the house, it is customary to refer the disturbance
to the Czan in the cupboard.
A BISHOP ON “THINGS SOLID.”
THE Bishop, ºr Oxfºrd AND QII-cum-Hosey made a beauti
speech at the Mansion House in favour of the ALBERT Memorial.
Nº. did tongue talk mºre silverly for bronze. Nevertheless, there is
a passage in the º º us not forget to observe, it is
... of the Bishop that in his elessness he is wholly unaware
of the road from Qxford to Lambeth)—a passage relating to “things
SAMtºº of Oxford observed (and
SAMUEL QARTER HALL, who, he said, “represented the artists,”
smiled and applauded the words) that—
º is ºf the very nature of things solid that, instead of being borne along upon the
of the stream of time, they sink gradually down beneath its waters; and, there-
regard to this great fact—and a great fact I hold it to have been—if any
is to be raised at all, I think it should be raised while yet the memory
of its greatness holds its true place in the impression of those by whom it was
witnessed.”
Because, if PRINCE ALBERT has not a monumentinbronze to remind
the short memory of human nature that there was once a Crystal
Palace in Hyde Park, the recollection of that greatſact, being a “thing
solid, will gradually sink down into the waters of oblivion. Just as,
doubtless, we should have forgotten Waterloo and its results, if certain
ladies of England had not set up a statue of Wellington acting
AcHILLEs in Hyde Park. Well, we have a motion that the best and
most enduring monument to the memory of the fleeting Crystal Palace
in the Park will be provided by the enduring glory, even at the present
time, crowning Sydenham º
e have the greatest admiration of the intellectual subtleties of the
Bishop of Oxford. Like an olive, his nature secretes its own oil.
Nºyertheless, we should have liked to hear other bishops upon “things
sºlid. Where was the Bishop of London: Is it possible that any
churchman can speak upon better authority, from deeper experience of
occasioned by mice and rats, as they consisted in scrapings, scratchings,
and knockings, such as are made by those animals. But in many cases
wherein the noises were the most violent, cheese contained in the cup-
board was found untouched; so that it was necessary to seeksome other
explanation of the acoustic phenomena.
º circumstances of table rapping obviously suggested that the
sounds were caused by spirits; and several powerful mediums were
consulted, independently, with respect to this point. The answers to
all inquiries obtained through these channels agreed in the fact that the
cupboards were haunted; and also coincided in the further information
that the name of their obstreporous inhabitant was Nicholas.
This startling declaration *..." rendered the character of the
author of the disturbances no ſonger doubtful, and was considered by
serious clergymen a conclusive proof that they resulted from “Satanic
ency.”
ºver, to subsequent interrogatories, as to whether the “Nicho-
Las" who scratched in the cupboards was the same as that personage
generally known as “Old Scratch,” the reply was uniformly in the
negative; and the cupboard-haunting Nichoras was described as not
that old one but “the other.”
Several defunct Nicholases were then named, and the question was
put with regard to each in succession, whether he was the one alluded
to; but in every case it was declared that the individual mentioned
was not the scratching Nicholas.
Atlast-in a kind of jocose despair—was put the iº whether
the Nignolas was the EMPERoR or Russia. When, to the amaze.
ment ºf all the hearers, the response distinctly rapped out was “Yes!”
A clue was thus obtained for ulterior investigation, by which it was
elicited that the Czan Nigholas was in the cupboards § force of his
operation on the loaf, of which, by his nefarious proceedings, prompted
by ambition, pride, and rapacity, he had raised the price to eve ºdy
in the nation. The knocking and scratching indicated rage º
combined with irritation and vexation on account of having got into *
scrape.
- #. sort of ubiquity which seems involved in one individual vermin
infesting so many cupboards at the same time, is declared to be a
mystery, the solution of which is referred to the abstruser laws of
mesmerism., By the assistance of the mediums we learn that Nicholas
has remarkable faculties of a spiritual kind, which he partakes of as
the limb participates in the nature of the parent body. Hence, indeed,
he is adored as the deity of the Russians; just as his ancient namesake
is honoured for his burning throne.”
Since the abºve particulars were communicated, it has been positively
averred, by ladies venerable for their years and other persons of the
soundest judgment as well as the highest respectability, that, ongoing
to their cupboards late at night to cut a slice of bread and butter, the

chief power of illustration of the “solids” of this life merely required
of SAMUEL of Oxon Moreover, PRINCE ALBERT is, it seems, to
have the statue: and among the alto-reliefs will, doubtless, be Challis
reading his patent of baronetcy.
The thing is decided upon. So, gentlemen, unbutton your pockets;
and down with the pounds—the “things solid,” if we mistake not,
Bishop of Oxford.
TWO PORTRAITS OF THE CZAR.
. In the well-known Letters from the Baltic, Nicholas is thus drawn
in pen and ink:-
“His face is strictly Grecian-forehead and nose is one grand line; the eyes finely
lined, large, open, and blue, with a calmness, a coldness, a freezing dignity, which can
equally quellar insurrection, daunt an assassin, or paralyse a petitioner: the mouth
regular, teeth fina chin prominent, with dark moustache and small whisker; but not
a sympathy in his face." His mouth sometimes smiled, his eyes never.”
Mr. Punch, having studied the Czar in his works, is disposed to put
forth another sketch; as thus—
His face is strictly all cheek: forehead and nose one grand round-
about curve; the eyes large, open, round, and expressive as a cannon's
mouth; cannon that can quellan insurrection, or slaughter innocence;
the mouth curved and significant as a scimitar; teeth and promi-
ment as chevaux-de-frise; the face altogether a nº"...}.
The mouth, like scimitar steel, sometimes glistens—the eyes never

Mutual Wrongs,
“We have no Windsor’—says, very mournfully, the EAmt of
Egºntoun-no Buckingham Palace, no St. James's, no Kensington,
no Hampton Court.”
Mr. Punch begs to mingle his tears with the tears of the noble Earl,
Mr. Punch the while lamenting as an Englishman that—"We have no
cockaleekie—no
haggis-no singed sheep's-head—no bagpipes!”
Grumbling for Farmers.
The late fine weather has enabled us to get the wheat into the

JUSTICE FOR LONDON.
QNE of the features in the LoRD MAYOR's Show of the ºther day was
a figure of “Justice, in a Car, drawn by Six Horses.” . Singularly
enough, the six horses showed a disposition to pull different ways, an
the leaders on each side were as obstinate in trying to upset JUSTICE
as a couple of Old Bailey barristers. It was rather a bold measure to
introduce Justice officially into any part of the proceedings on LORD
MAYoR's Day, for if the goddess were present among the Corporation
in reality rather than in effigy, the probability is, that there would be
no procession on LoRD MAYor's Day, in consequence of there being no
LoßD MAYoR, as a natural result of there being no Aldermen from
whom to select the potentate. - - -
It might have been remarked the other day, that the civic idea of
Justice differs from all the ordinary motions of the character, for the
JUSTICE of the Corporation of London as seen in the º:
instead of being blindfold, wore a bandage over the forehead in such a
way as not to interfere with her sight, or prevent her from having both
her eyes open to her own interest. Her scales were rather gigantic,
but i. did not them in her hand, and they seemed to be emble-
matical of nothing but the balance she keeps hung up, as it, were,
without being accounted for. Poor Justice seemed to be frightfully
shaken by the treatment she experienced in the %; and, after the
fatigues of the day were at an end, was heard to say that she had not a
leg to stand º If a representation of Justice for the City had reall
been needed for the Lond MAYok's Show, how much better it woul
have been to have mounted the Corporation Commissioners on the Car,
and have displayed them to the world as the real emblems of that
Justice which the City is likely to experience, when the present dis-
closures of civic corruption have produced their legitimate consequence.

Of all Tables we should think the Tables of figures in BRADSHAw's

THE AGRICULTURAL INQUISITION.
HERE's Government again at we wi' moor new fangled whims and fancies,
A callin' on us vor to gle a statement of our circumstances;
Now, zince we’ve got to undergoo this delicate investigation,
O’ coorse, my friends, our best we’ll do to furnish every information.
We be to zay what land we got—how many acres under tillage—
They seeks to find that out for what?—not surely with intent to pillage.
They wants the number of our stock, which if we wonders why they axes,
At any rate we knows full well it can’t be to lay on moor taxes.
We’m to º down in black-on-white, our cows, and pigs, and ship,
and hosses;
Which them as don’t know how to write Is’pose must do by means o'
crosses :
Our wheat, our barley, wuts, and rye, our beans, our hay, and straw
moreover,
Our mangold-wurzel, turmuts, ay, and taters, sainfoin, too, and clover.
Praps we shall likewise ha’ to state the number of our ploughs and
arrows,
Wheel carriages, both small and great, from carts and waggons down
to barrows,
Machines that to the farm belongs, our clod crushers and scarifiers,
And all our forks, and rakes, and prongs, according as the case requires.
Our poultry booked they may expect–returns o' turkeys and gallanies,
Along o' lists made out correct o' Bantams, Dorkins §. haneys,
And geese and ducks, and pigeons; nay, may be they ºil want a inventory,
Including all the eggs they lay; a pretty joke and likely story !
How 'twas the project fust arose of sneakin in behind the curtain,
By gettin of us to expose our secrets, I consider certain;
'Tis Popery in the Government that wishes for to get possession
Of our affairs; for which intent they tries to bring us to confession.
We very soon shall find, I fear, the country in a sad condition,
'Tis the beginning, all this here, I take it, of the Inquisition,
You’ll ...'. the fagots blaze, unless you stand resolved and steady;
There's the New Forest, anyways, directed to be cut already.

P—nce Alb-rt. “SAVE ME, DEAR PUNCH, FROM THESE MOST RIDICULOUS FRIENDS.”
FLUSHING A SEWER.—A CITIZEN'S DREAM.
I SNORED in slumber comatose,
Soaked, stuffed, and gorged too full by far;
Across my red and bulbous nose
QUEEN MAB then drove her tiny car;
Whereon I clambered precipices,
And tumbled headlong down abysses,
And roamed among strange edifices,
Till I at last saw Temple Bar.
Yes: there was . Bar, no doubt,
Öf that i felt com etely sure;
Yet there was something strange about
The gateway—mystic and obscure—
A character and meaning double;
And from foul puddles, signs of trouble,
Whilst gas around began to bubble,
It formed the mouth of some great sewer.
Then, in the visions of the night,
Behold a Broom the kenne brushed,
And a Voice cried, “”T will be all right
Ere long !” and then the Voice was hushed ;
And then I heard a sullen mutter,
A sort of grumbling in the gutter;
And after that, the same Woice utter
These words: “THE SEWER MUST BE FLUsiied.
When lo! a noise of dismal cries
Grunts, groans, and squeaks of wild despair,
The anguish of a thousand sties,
With frightful discord rent the air:
And jº. in the dreamy juggle,
Approaching waters seemed to struggle,
Gurgle, and dash, and splash, and guggle
And through the portal burst ..". -
22
Ah! what a cataract'of slush
And monstrous mud was there to see.
Like noisome soup appeared to gush
The sizy torrent, now set free;
And in the mess lurched #. blºated,
With fat heads, whose dull eyes still gloated
On morsels that around them floated
Of callipash and callipee.
The Sword, the Cap, the Mace, the Chain,
Regalia of the Civic Crown, .
Disgorged by that enormous drain,
#. and hitched with robe and gown,
With acts, and deeds, and charter-scrolls
Of fees and metage, dues and toils
On corn, fruit, oysters, salt, and coals,
Came rolling, rumbling, tumbling down.
Pie Poudre, Leet and Baron Court,
With Swanhoppers no more to hop,
Those dark and dirty billows' sport,
Together hurled, went squash, and flop.:
And one who stemmed, till Hope's last glimmer,
The slab surge that did round him simmer,
The Water Bailiff—sturdy swimmer;
He too was swamped amid the slop.
With sirloins, haunches, all these things
Were mashed; with jelly, ice, and cream,
Chantilly biscuits, legs and wings
Of game and poultry, and the stream
Bore salmon, turbot, hash, and curry,
Goblet and ll, hurryskurry,
My brain was bursting with the worry-
And then I started from my dream!
The Results, of Striking.—It is as strange as it is lamentable
that strikes should so commonly end in broken heads, since the moment
the men have once struck there is a stoppage of the mill.
Not FAR OUT.-A cynical old Cockney of our acquaintance says
he considers the moustache movement to be only a new way the young
fellows have got into of giving themselves 'airs.

KING LEOPOLID REPORTS PROGRESS.
HE KING of THE BELGIANs opened his
Chambers last week, and it is to be regretted
that KING LEopold's excellent speech has
been so incorrectly translated by the
London newspapers. No wonder that LoRD
CLARENDoN complains of the inadequate
way in which the journalists render, his
despatches. An English dramatic author,
hurried in his rapine, could º have
adapted a French speech more clumsily
than it has been done for our papers. We
subjoin a literal translation:
“GENTLEMEN,
“I am charmed to meet you again.
When we separated, you were so kind as to
express your entire satisfaction with the
marriage. I told you I had then in view for
my son, the DUKE of BRABANT. Ineed not
inform you that the match has since come
off, because I do not suppose you will easily
forget the portentous (effroyable) disturb-
ance we made about it. But you will be
happy to hear that I have taken MARY
HENRIETTA of AustEIA, and her husband
over to England, and that our charming
friend and relative QUEEN VICTORIA
was quite pleased with the bride, and considers BRABANT a fortunate
young fellow. -
“It is, I hope, unnecessary for me to say that it was not merely, or
chiefly, to introduce a young wife to a young matron that...I endured
the perilous voyage from Östend to Portsmouth. You will do your
King more justice. - -
“Allied with the House of Austria, I found in that marriage the
strongest reason why my voice should be heard in England at a
conjunctureYºº when Austria needed an advocate there. But this
is not all. You know how long and how sedulously I have laboured
to get the EMPEROR Nicholas to accredit an ambassador from Russia
to É. His Majesty has, for years, disdained my request with
Northern haughtiness (fierté), but, either for reasons of mine or his
own, he has at last accorded the favour. Since that boon, it is well
known to you that Russia has had only to ask and to have in Belgium;
I was therefore doubly bound to undertake my English mission, charged
as I was with the interests of Austria and of Russia. - - -
“That the Prince Consort of England and myself retired into the
shooting field together—for the Sovereign of England has a certain
straightforwardness (droiture), which makes it difficult to urge diº
matic considerations in her hearing—you may have learned. If I
alluded to the danger which might accrue to Saxe-Gotha in the event
of Russia, Austria, and Prussia not regarding its princes as their
friends, I am sure the august sportsman to whom, I addressed such a
speculation will not have listened to me in vain. The friends of MARY
#. and of our newly-arrived ambassador have no reason to be
dissatisfied with the effect I produced.
“I may therefore felicitate you, Gentlemen, and myself, on the
}. concord which exists between Russia, Austria, Saxe-Gotha, and
elgium, and I am glad to add that the aged and accomplished prime
minister of England, the good ABERDEEN, fully concurs in the
sentiments of those four powers.
“Details of your own finance and other topics affecting yourselves
will be supplied by my Ministers, but I could not refrain from
personally informing you of the quadruple alliance which I, and our
charming y HENRIETTA, have done so much to cement, and which
I trust you will remember should we ask for any little addition to the
estimates.
“That the blessing of, &c.”
THE “GOD OF RUSSIA.”
Nicholas is the acknowledged, deity of the Muscovites. A god
standing six feet four in his sacred stockings. The manner in which
he recruits, his army to carry on his Holy Wars is very celestial,
Sometimes he causes his angelic Cossacks to surround a boys' school
and carry off the scholars, promoting them from the birch to the knout.
In one particular case two boys, one 12 and the other 14, were carried
away, their old grandmother of 85 raising her, hands, doubtless in
rayer for the God of Russia. , Who can doubt the Christianity of an
Imperor, who is at once the heart and soul of such a system º Poor
fellow!. In his last proclamation he says “He has been goaded into
war by the Porte.” Goaded is the word. Only think of the nasty
red-wattled turkey gobbling at and goading a poor, harmless, innocent
bear'ſ We shall next have the Christian dove pecking out the eyes of
the twin-headed eagle.
THE INNKEEPER RHYMER.
Now that every British Innkeeper clearly, holds himself privileged
to take as many people in continually as his house will hold, it º:
come a question of quite national importance how most effectually to
check their chousing. In our position of Adviser-General to the
Nation, we have of course been nationally consulted in the matter, and
we therefore feel called upon to give our readers—we mean of course
the nation—our . on the subject.
It being generally admitted, by everybody but themselves, that the
present system of our Innkeepers has become, like a baby, quite a crying
nuisance, we think it may most properly be dealt with in the cradle:
and we would therefore have our rising generation early prepared for the
fleecing that awaits them. We are sure that by judicious treatment a
wholesome horror of hotels might be easily impressed upon the infant
mind. We would have the landlord take the place of the infantine
... Old Bogy,” and figure in our fairytales as the terrible old Ogre, who
lives upon the unsuspecting travellers who come to him: while in all the
juvenile editions of our Natural History he might be represented as a
* only known in England, of the Ornithorynchus, or Beast with a
iii. Instead of the deeds of mythic “Forty Thieves,” our nursemaids
should recount the rogueries of an inn; and, instead of threatening a
“dark room” by way of penal settlement for the fractious, they in future
might condemn them to a “private” one at an hotel, lit with nominal
wax candles at half-a-crown an inch. “Reform your Landlord’s Bills”
should be, of course, an early round-hand º and the first thing in
the spelling-book a spell against extortion. In short, no means should
be spared to represent an hotel as a sort of inhumane mantrap, which it
is impossible to get out of without considerable bleeding.
The same wholesome warning might be given through the medium
of those senseless lyrics which are known to us, collectively, as our
Nursery Rhymes. We have long had a contempt for these unmeaning
Humpty-Dumptys, and have long considered them a national disgrace.
They were an insult to our cradlehood, and are still continually an
annoyance to our maturer ears. . The proverbial wisdom of our ances-
tors is but little shown, we think, in having handed them down to us.
It is humiliating to think that in this era o º this present
March-or, we should rather say, November—of Intellect, such nonsense
can be tolerated. Any well-regulated baby must, we are persuaded,
feel itself disgraced by it, -
In the position we hold as national benefactors, we have long been
anxious to reform these truly “nonsense verses,” and we are resolved
that when our stereotyped “want of space” no longer afflicts us, we
will “seriously incline” our pen to an attempt at their amendment.
Meanwhile, upon a subject so suggestive as the present, we can’t resist
throwing a little reason in the rhymes; and we feel we shall be doing
}; infant state some service by printing, as a specimen, our Innkeeper
7ter.
y AIR.—" Hushaby Baby.”
Chouse away, innkeeper, while you’ve the chance,
For you’ll very soon drive all the tourists to France:
A crown for a breakfast—eight shillings for lunch—
Pay him his bill, and expose him in Punch.
AIR.—" Ride a Cock-horse.”
Dine at the Cross off steak tough as horse,
And charged at the rate of a crown for a course;
With bills ever high, and bows ever low,
You shall have chousing wherever you go.
AIR.—“Sing a Song of Sixpence.”
Sing a song of fleecing:
A pocket full of gold
In four-and-twenty hours
Will be quite cleaned out, I’m told.
Would you stay a fortnight,
A fortune you must º
For while they serve you like a Commoner,
They charge you like a King.
Two shillings for a cup of tea,
And sixpence more for “honey;”
And however light your dinner be,
A heavy sum of money.
Half-a-crown for wax-lights,
Tallowy in smell:
So wherever you’re admitted,
You are taken in as well.
Follow ING THE FASHION.—The French start the Fashions, and the
English follow them.

MATERIALS FOR A MUSEUM OF CITY ANTIQUITIES.
THE ALBERT STATUE MOVEMENT.
A MEETING of the principal metropolitan Statues took place yesterday morning at Exeter
Hall. Time was when such an assemblage would have been locked upon as rather an extra-
ordinary event; but recent manifestations have prepared the public mind for the phenomena
of statue moving and statue talking: and this convention of sculptures created more interest
than astonishment. The object of its attendants was to take into consideration the proposal
for the increase of their number by the addition thereto of a monument to His Royal Highness
PRINCE ALBERT.
The STATUE or FERGus MacIvorº—from the shop-front of MR. SANDERson, tobacconist-
having been voted into the chair, stated the purpose of the gathering. Of course the
costume of the PRINCE's statue would be determined with reference to the associations
of Balmoral; and he should hail the introduction of the illustrious new member to the
clan. The only question was, where to place the Statue? For his part he, should have
* pleasure in affording it a site by vacating his own post at the door, and retiring into
e sno
The
Sºrºr or George The Third would willingly resign to the new comer a position
which was painfully conspicuous, and withdraw
into an obscurity where a pigtail would cease to
attract perpetual derision.
The STATUE of GeoRGE THE FourTH, º:
with the effigy of his Royal Parent, would be
glad to abdicate in favour of the Statue of the
* * º * º sensible of
constituting, together with his quadruped, some-
º very unlike one of the Elgin Marbles, "it
would delight him to dismount, and let the
PRINCE get up instead.
KING CHARLEs, The FIRs1's STATUE at
Charing Cross said, perhaps the taste of the
Committee would determine that His Royal
HighNess should get up behind.
The Duke of York’s Statue felt that there
were peculiar reasons why, if any site were relin-
uished in favour of the intended testimonial, it
should be his own. The country owed some-
thing, anyhow, to PRINCE ALBERT; but whatever
PRINCE ALBERT owed the º he paid his
debts, and his representative would not be ex-
posed to continual banter on that score.
The STATUE of the GREAT DUKE, from BUR-
Ton’s Arch, said that he had the honour to
represent FIELD-MARsh AL THE Duke of WEL-
Ingros. FIELD-MARsh AL the Duke of WEL-
|LINgtoN had been awarded by the country a
Statue during his life. The same tribute was
about to be paid to FIELD-MARSHAL PRINCE
ALBERT. The Statue of FIELD-MARshAL THE
Duke had nothing to say to any estimate the
country might think fit to form of the compara-
tive necessity for a Statue of FIELD-MARSHAL
The PRINCE. But that point ºf...; the
#º place for the Statue would be parallel to
is (the Statue of the Duke's) own. His own
was the top of the arch on one side of the road,
and PRINCE ALBERT's might be that of the gate-
way on the other.
.NElson's STATUE considered that the sugges-
tion of the Statue of the Noble Duke was
founded on the notion that the monument to
PRINCE ALBERT was intended to commemorate
the Great Exhibition. In that case the gateway
at Hyde Park Corner º would be the
fittest place for it; near enough to the scene of
the triumph, and alongside of the memorial to
the Hero of Waterloo. But, to speak straight-
forwardly, the fact was, that the scheme of a
Statue to the PRINCE was a device of the Cor-
poration of London to ingratiate themselves at
Court. The Statue was meant to be a propitia-
tory concern—to conciliate the protection of
Royalty for the City, and the proper situation
for it would be over Temple Bar, to serve as a
Palladium to that edifice and the interests there-
with connected.
Gog and MAgog, rising together, loudly ex-
pressed their approbation of this view; the
adoption of which would tend to secure them-
selves in their own places, which they wished to
retain as º as they were able, like all others
holding comfortable situations in Guildhall.
A motion, embodying the concurrence of the
meeting in the opinion that the Statue of PRINce
|ALBERT should surmount Temple Bar was then
put and carried unanimously, when, after the
usual vote of thanks, the meeting broke up, and
the molten and graven images departed to their
respective sites.
Sheriffs' officers Superseded.
We hear that an ingenious mechanic at
Ipswich has invented a machine to perform per-
petual motion, which is described as “self-acting
after being put in motion by a screw.” So is
a bailiff who acts on a usurer's writ. We
wonder if the Ipswich automaton would arrest
an insolvent?

CLOWNS OF THE NEW SCHOOL.
oMEBODY said that it takes a wise man to make a fool.
This stands to reason, like the parallel proposition, that
it takes a man to make a beast of himself; for if any-
body is rendered either beast or fool by his own act, he
cannot have been either the one or the other previously.
But, running counter to the proverb, fools now endea-
vour to make wise men, and the Clown on the stage
combines the teacher with the tumbler; is didactic and
funny; intermingles philosophy with antics, and moral-
izes and makes faces by turns. The P; public
may perhaps admire this conjunction of light and shade
with motley; if so, its taste will be catered for by enter-
prising managers. In the
mimes for Christmas, the Clowns should be got to
throws off his great head, and his regal vestments, or
doublet and trunk hose, and rushes to the footlights,
he utters an exclamation and propounds an interrogatory.
Tradition requires thus much; but Fashion will de-
mand more. . He will have to expand and amplify the
old forms of words whose brevity has hitherto been
sufficiently instructive as well as amusing, so as
to elucidate the fulness of their significance. For
example:—Having been transformed from Emperor to Zany, MR.
MERRYMAN, at the tap of the Fairy's wand, jumps out of his robes, and
appears in his diversified and proper colours. He turns his toes in,
and runs up to one of the stage boxes. He there stoops forwards,
resting his hands on his knees, grins, squints, rolls his eyes, thrusts
his tongue out, and pulling himself by the ears, draws it back again,
He then composes his flake-white and vermilion countenance, and
utters the following soliloquy :–
“On this spot of earth, at this moment of time, between the past
and the future, that is to say, HERE, an aggregation of human
entities, animal creatures endowed with reason and conscience, a
multitude of Objects that constitute You in relation to the One
Individual Subject, Myself: in a word, WE, exist in a state of conscious

“To condense my meaning into the fewest words by which it is
capable of being confined, I would remark that,
‘Here We Are -
“And to that momentous observation, allow me to add the profound

So saying, the Clown flings a summerset, and proceeds to
pockets, swallow sausages, and burn himself with the hot

metaphysics.

THE POST OFFICE LONDON DIRECTORY FOR 1854.
We have perused this volume with considerable pleasure. We
observe that it contains two thousand four hundred and ten pages
most of them comprising three columns of closely printed matter, and
but that we found it impossible to take the book up, we have no doubt
We should have found it equally impossible to lay it down. As a
literary, composition it is really remarkable, for the tone which the
author takes up at the beginning is preserved to the very end, and the
same unflaggingness, if we maybe permitted the word, which on page
l intrºduces, us; with a PALMERSTóNIAN jauntiness, to Mr. Apport's

tenacity of purpose, to MR: WILLIAM YouNg, the accidental secretary
of deaths, on page 2288. But do not let us be misunderstood. There
is no monotony of treatment. We are successively presented with a
series of takkauſ, or rather tables, of life, of a perpetually varyin
çharacter. We first find “our warmest welcome at an inn,” an
Green Dragons, Blue Lions, Essex Serpents, and White Horses, spit
roar, hiss, and neigh before us in all the frightful friendliness o
provincial hospitality. Then we are shown ºi circles, and there is

overhauls the travelling baskets of returning young ladies, near the
Custom House Stairs. Anon, the mysteries of the streets of London
are laid open to us with a minuteness which neither Asmodeus nor
MR. PETER CUNNINGHAM has ever attempted. But our author is not
confined to the trottoir; trades—whose followers look jealously on the
census-paper, and by no means affectionately on the income-tax return—
are thrown open, and to him everybody reveals his business instead of
telling the prying writer to go about his own. He equally shines in his
|portraiture of political life, and not a senator, hereditary or acci.
dental, spiritual or ſº escapes his eye. The next time Lond
|NAAs has to hunt for MR. KEOGH, he may be spared the scandal of
airing himself eleven times, in vain, upon the mosaics of the Reform
Club; and the next time the nation is looking out for a Premier, it need
not, for lack of an address, select Lord ABERDEEN instead of Mr. Punch.
The voluble actuary of the assurance office, the drab-breeched and white-
haired banker, the smart stockbroker and the smarting stockjobber,
the parchment-visaged chamber-counsel, and the bold-eyed champion
at the Old Bailey, the dowager of A. the guardsman of the
club, the virtuous and self-denying author in his ANDREw MARVEL
chambers, the post-ºffice clerk, and all the men of letters (hal ha!)
of St. Martin's-le-Grand, the sour bachelor of the Albany, and the
gentle Benedick of St. John's Wood, and "M". myriads who
f. to make London, from HER GRAgious MAJESTY down to—
no, Punch is merciful—are all designated here. In short, inapplicable
as is the word to the biggest as well as the best book of our acquaint-
ance, the Post Qffice Directory not only contains all that we want to
know, but precise information as to at least a couple of millions of
people whom—except, as readers, in which capacity they exist already
—we sincerely hope that we never shall know.
The following extract gives a good idea of the author's style:—
“Smith John, Hairdresser, 24, Skinner Street, Clerkenwell.
Smith John, Hide and Skin Salesman, Bermondsey Skin Market.

Reform in the City.
ALREADy, reform has been felt in Guildhall. At the LoRD MAYor's
state dinner, the eighty waiters employed to change plates and pour
out for the Corporation had, every one of them, a whole half-pint of
beer! This allowance was pre-arranged by way of test, and for future
guidance. One Alderman is worth, at least, four waiters. Hence, at
all future banquets, every Alderman will have allowed him a whole
quart of beer, and beer of the bitterest into the bargain.

COBDEN ON EVIL SPIRITS.
MR. Cobden has written another of those pithy letters
º 5 | on great principles that—some day—will make a very
- charming little volume of Cobdeniana. He is solicited to
give his opinion on the best mode of “Opening the trade
in spirits?”
“The best, way,” replies, sagacious Richamp, “of
- dealing with the monopoly of spirits is to abstain from
- - drinking them, which for upwards of twenty years I have
done.”—Spirits make felons, lunatics, and suicides, says
MR. CoRDEN. Hence, the Bottle might surmount Newgate
and Bedlam. MR. Cobb EN does not drink spirits; but,
moderately, he drinks wine—wine that cheereth the heart
of man? Will he, then, do his best that the masses of his
countrymen may take a glass with him The wine-growers
of France want to sell us pure, cheap, healthy wine—wine
that would soon destroy burning gin, inflammatory brandy.
France needs iron, England claret. Will MR. Cobdex,
if only as an apostle of peace, help us, that we may ex-
change British metal for Gallic grape?' We should like
to drive the English “pig’’ into the French vineyard.

COURTESY AND CONTROVERSY.
In a kindly and reasonable letter to the Times, the Rev. J. M. CAPEs,
a Roman Catholic clergyman, recommends controversialists, both those
of his own creed, and Protestants, to conduct their discussions with
moderation and decency. This excellent advice, we are sure, will
be followed by all disputants of either sect who are arguing for truth.
DR. CUMMING approves of it. So doubtless will DR.NEwMAN. Nay,
perhaps one, or two, or even three more, on each side, will adopt the
judicious and amiable suggestion of MR. CAPEs.
But as the object of the great majority of polemics is not truth but
triumph, the º is that they will not confine themselves to
ormed logic, but like a sort of candidates at the theological
hustings, will continue to bandy, aspersions, as heretofore, and cover
one another with all the ridicule they can, each with the view of bring-
ing his adversary into contempt and odium with the British Public.
Moreover, there is a stake at issue—no offence either to Rome or
Geneva; liberty of thought, speech, and writing; freedom, political
and social. The question is, whether, Britons shall be subjugated to a
priesthood, and a º power—and not only that, but whether, by
receiving the religion of Rome, we may not engage ourselves to accept
the institutions of Naples. Which question it is not likely that
Britons will discuss dispassionately; and moderation may be inculcated
to those who are at issue upon it with about as much hope as gentle-
ness and forbearance may be preached to the belligerents in Moldo-
Wallachia. -
MR. CAPEs complains of “a certain class of objects” of Roman
Catholic faith and affection being “made the subjects of scorn, ridicule,
and reviling.”, Very bad taste this on the part of Protestant buffoons.
But since
that º be offered to them can hurt nobo y but the scoffer, surely
such bad taste ought not to annoy, MR. CAPEs further than by exciting
in his mind a painful anxiety for the fate of those who are guilty of it.
Let MR. CApes consider what manner of persons those are, who are
vexed by having their persuasions derided. They are not those who
believe that two and two make four; no, but those who believe that
two and two make something else. They are those who believe what
Mººre believes; and those who believe themselves to be Kings or
elties.
Alluding to a particular tenet, which to Protestants appears contrary
to common sense, MR. CAPEssays—
“Let not such a doctrine be made the subject for jesting, scoffing, contemptuous
sneers, or those still more revolting attempts at convincing us that we are fools, which
the followers of Exeter fail occasionally adopt.”
It seems strange that the attempt to convince MR. CAPEs that he is
a fool should be still more revolting to him than the derision of what
Woº. xxv.
if the objects alluded to are worthy of reverence, any insult ||
he esteems most holy. But, not to dwell on this point, how, we may
ask, if a dogma is absurd, is it possible to convince a man that it is so
without at the same time º him that he is a fool for believing
it?" To use a rather West British form of eech, we are sure that any
wise man who differs from MR. CAPEs º be much obliged to that
º * for proving to him that, in respect of that difference,
e was a 1001. -

MONG the numerous
oints which have struck
r. Punch in perusing
the evidence taken before
the invaluable. Commis-
sion which is daily forging
the hatchet destined to
hew down that rotten old
tree the Corporation, and
scatter its owls and bats,
is the remarkably miscel-
laneous character of the
information with which
the witnesses favour the
Commissioners. Any gen-
tleman who is passing
and chooses to step in,
is politely asked by the
Chairman whether he
happens to know any-
thing about, the º: o
which, with equal off-
handedness, he replies,
“Well, yes,” or “Well,

MR. SUFFEET DE PERISTYLE: I am an architect. O, yes. I have taken much interest in
the City; and sometimes, while shaving, I have mentally sketched out plans for improving it.
Will I state any? With pleasure; . as my principal plan has relation to the Cºrporation,
it is the more desirable for you to hear it. I am for dealing boldly with the City. Let
us begin at Temple Bar, which I would not remove. Take down the whole of the hºuses
on both sides of Fleet Street and Ludgate Hill, and clear the space to the Thames. Embank
the Thames. On the left side of Fleet Street, erect a splendid series of halls, cloisters, and
habitations, reaching from Temple Bar to St. Paul's. Throw King's College, the London
University, Merchant Tailor's, the Blue Coat School, and the Charterhouse into these, and
re-endow them, and ºy all expenses by confiscating the Corporation estates, and, if necessary
the private property of the º. Let the right hand side of Fleet Street be a beautiful
meadow, with fountains and statues, to the Thames. Preserve Mr. Punch's, of cºurse, but
rebuild it in alabaster, and make it, the feature of the scene. Take down St. Paul's and
re-construct it, in white marble, which will wash, and clear away in its rear an area of a
quarter of a mile, to be paved with mosaic.—(The Commission, fairly aghast and out of breath,
cause the witness to be removed.) -
MR. GRUBB ; I keep the accounts in a City house, as my father did before me, and, I

PRINCE PUNCH TO PRINCE
ALBERT.
ILLUSTRIOUs and excellent brother,
Don't consider me rude or unkir
If, as from one Prince to another,
I give you a bit of my mind—
And I do so with all the more roundness,
As your conduct amongst us has shown
A propriety, judgment, and soundness
f taste, not surpassed by my own.
You’ve respected JoHN BULL’s little oddities,
Never trod on the old fellow’s corns;
Chose his pictures and statues—commodities
Wherein his own blunders he mourns.
And if you're a leetle more German
In these than I’d have you—what is't
Beyond what a critic may term an
2ducational bias or twist?
On the summer house walls, in your garden,
Qf R.A.'s., fresco-painters you've made;
A demand which some of them won't pardon
Since good drawing's required for the trade.
You've roused to new life the Society
Of Arts, which had grown mighty flat;
And the Army to you, with propriety,
Attributes the famed ALBERT hat.
When the zeal for the Great Exhibition
Down to zero seemed likely to drop,
Mayors Provincial, at your requisition,
Of a sudden showed souls above shop.
Inspired up they went, like sky-rockets,
At the call of a Patriot Prince—
Nay, more, put their hands in their pockets
o a tune ne'er before known—nor since.
Foundation stones, past calculation,
Workmanlike, you have laid, true and square
And a curiously dinner-rid nation
Has still found you a saint in the chair.
Goodness knows what ineffable dinners,
What drinks deleterious you’ve borne,
What "...i from long-winded sinners
You’ve endured with a patience unworn
You have never pressed forward unbidden;
When called on you’ve never shown shame
Not paraded, nor prudishly hidden
Your person, your purse, or your name;
You’ve lent no man occasion to call you
Intruder, intriguer, or tool;
Even I’ve not had often to haul you
O'er the coals, or to take you to school.
All this, my dear PRINCE, gives me boldness—
Which, au reste, our positions allow—
For a hint (which you’ll not charge to coldness,
After all I have written just now):
Which is to put down certain flunkies,
Who by flatt'ry your favour would earn,
Pelting praise at your head, as at monkeys
Tars throw stones—to get nuts in return.
My Lord MAYor may beplaster his liveries
With velvet and gingerbread gold;
Though all, what he’d perhaps call “dis-
kiveries,”
Are bursting from every fold:
He may perch up a Justice from Astley's
Atop of a |...}.} car,
Not less fit for the day, or less ghastly’s
Her rouge, than frauds corporate are.
He may summon his friends to swill turtle,
And gulp ven’son, like pigs in a stye;—
Line the Mansion House staircase with myrtle
And laurel—the Sphynx can tell why;--
He may bow to the Bench of Exchequer,
Have Ministers sit at his board;—
Civic barges no farther from wreck are,
Gog and MAGog no less s.all be floored.

The hands that prepare }. ovation,
My dear PRINCE, ought at least to be clean;
Not the hands of a doomed Corporation,
Fouled with all that is venal and mean:

Whereof tithe they’ve unrighteously taken;
There’s the flour of the poor man's rolls there,
And the grease of the poor man's bacon.

POSTAL ECONOMY AT GLASGOW.
Scotch MEN are famous for their economical disposition. Here is
a remarkable instance of Scotch economy:-
* LETTER CARRIERS–AN APPEAL.
“To the Editor of the Glasgow Herald.
“DEAR SIR,-We feel, with you, indignant at the scurvy treatment we have received
at the hands of the London authorities, in reference to our Post Office, and think we
ought to take the matter in the meantime in our own hands, so far as concerns the
Carriers.
“We all confess they are badly paid, and a highly deserving class of public servants.
We therefore propose to all the merchants in this district to co-operate with us and
form a committee, to give a practical expression to our feelings for the men, by raising
a fund to give them at least 4s. per week extra to their present low salaries, and a suit
of comfortable uniform.
“We calculate that a very small weekly sum from a tenth part of the merchants here
would place the men for one year in a comfortable position, and be the means more
fully of calling public attention and indignation to the subject.
“If the above scheme succeeds in this district, it might be extended to others.
“Wo shall be glad to receive communications on this proposal, and shall consider
ourselves richly paid for any trouble we have taken in the matter, if it be the means
of placing the Letter Carriers in comparative comfort.
“We are, dear Sir, yours very truly,
“Wilson & MATHEson, 58, Candleriggs.”
It is much cheaper for a merchant to contribute a small weekly sum
towards giving his letter carrier a proper salary, than it is to be out of
pocket through having letters of importance, some containing re-
mittances, mislaid or stolen, because the man is not paid enough to
induce a competent and honest person to undertake the situation.
This example of Scotch prudence, therefore, is one that deserves
to be followed by the generous commercial public, indeed by the public
at large, of º and ; if HER MAJESTY's upper servants at Downing
Street cannot be induced to allot a fair proportion of wages to HER
MAJESTY's under servants in connexion with St. Martin's-le-Grand.
But it would really be almost a saving if the Government were to
give the postmen a reasonable hire. en MERCURY the messenger
turns MERCURY the thief, and, tempted by want, steals half-a-sovereign,
marked by MR. ScultHoRPE, out of the letter he is intrusted with,
getting himself, by that act, into the dock at the Assizes, and thence
into penal servitude, he costs the country, from first to last, more than
would have sufficed to maintain several honest MERCURIEs during the
same time in blue and scarlet and respectability.
That the proposal, alike judicious and handsome, for making up for
Government's stinginess to the letter carriers by private liberality
should have emanated from MEssRs. WILSON AND THESON 0
Glasgow, is a fact, that adds a feather to the cap of Scotland, and if
acted upon by their countrymen, will render it impossible any º
to withhold the position on the Royal Standard, which is claimed by
that sagacious and noble animal the Scottish Lion.
The Post-Office Directory.
THE companion volume to the above elegant publication is the
“Almanach des 25,000 Addresses,” published at Paris. . We do not
know who is the Éditor of that interestin volume, in which may be
found some of the greatest names in French literature and science, but
we should say that no one would be better qualified for the task than
the BRITISH, DRAMA, as no one, as our stage can testify, can possibly
be acquainted with a greater number of French cribs.

The EMPEROR or Russia's lying manifesto concludes with a quo.
tation from a PsALM. This is only fresh proof that old Nicholas can
quote Scripture for his purpose.
THE Most CURIOUs THING.-A woman not being curious!
CURE FOR SMOKY CHILDREN.
“MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“My son HENRY-who promised to be such a good young
man—has, I am sorry to say, acquired that nasty dirty habit of smoking
tobacco, in which he indulges from ºf till º: such a pity at
his time of life for he is not of age yet. In the Times the other day
I saw a letter about the Smoke Nuisance, proposing to cure it by ‘very
frequent feeding in small quantities, and a reward for no smoke.” §
you think, now, it would be º to break HENRY of smoking by
continually tempting him with little bits of something very nice to eat?
—the worst of it is that filthy Fº has quite spoiled his taste for cake
and tart. Reward for no smoke I have offered in vain. I should be
so much obliged to you, Mr. Punch, if §". could suggest any plan by
which i could manage to wean my child from his cigars by frequent
feeding in small quantities; indeed, indeed, it would be quite a
charity to "A MOTHER.”
*...* The frequent feeding in small quantities might, in all probability,
be accomplished easily º An occasional kidney—if devilled, so
much the better; a broiled bone now and then; from time to time a
sausage; an anchovy toast after dessert: later in the evening, º
a poached egg, a Welsh rabbit, or a few scalloped oysters: these and
similar delicacies substituted for pastry, would most likely very much
simplify the difficulty of getting HENRY to take small quantities of food
at short intervals. But ... unfortunately proves that such a
system of diet is not generally accompanied, on the part of young men
by a discontinuance of smoking; whilst it is almost always attended
with an excessive consumption of mali liquor.—PUNch.

o well to imitate.
If there was “no addition to the Royal
dinner,” it is clear that the Royal Family must,
on the day in º have been eating cold-
or at most hashed—the “joint” of the day pre-
vious. We confess we do not like the idea of
the younger branches being deprived of any of
those little luxuries so dear to juvenile as well
as to “other lips and other hearts;” and, there-
fore, in the event of any future announcement
of “no addition to the Royal dinner,” we should
be glad to read the extra intimation “but there
was a pudding in the nursery.”

The Price of Coals Accounted for.
It is usual with small tradesmen to increase
the weight of coals by sprinkling cold water
upon them; but in the City the reason why coals
come so heavy is owing to the City detes falling
upon them for twenty miles round London.
When these dews are collected, it is, found that
the difference, which, of course, weighs upon the
rice, amounts, in the course of the year, to many
#. thousands of pounds!
AN ALARMING DISCOVERY.
Somebody is advertising every day an instrument
warranted to “frighten but not kill” the public in general.
The terrific instrument is no less than a Gong, which for
40 shillings will frighten a thief, will º a burglar.”
for 60 shillings, and for the comparatively small matter
of four pounds will “alarm the country.” We hope, the
Government will at once put a prohibitory duty on these
gongs, for it will be an awful state ºf things if anybody
may have it in his power to frighten the isle from its pro-
riety for eighty shillings. Unless something is imme-
iately done to check the danger that threatºns us, there
is no doubt that “Bang goes the Gong” will become as
great a nuisance as “Pop goes the Weasel.”
Turtle in Ecstasies.
Accounts from Honduras represent, the turtle in the
Bay as exhibiting symptoms of extraordinary excitement;
flapping their fins, paddling about with unwºnted rapidity,
lifting themselves on end and dancing and º out
of the water; in short, realising the most vivid idea of
lively, turtle. These symptoms of hilarity among the
furnishers of green fat have been referred to, the antici-
pation of the extinction of the City of London Corpºration,
and consequent discontinuance of the Lord Mayor's
ers.
The GoRTschakorr. JACKET.
The uniform of PRINCE, GoRTschakorº. has not been
described. We believe the principal article of it is a
“cut-away.”
Protection for the Sloe.
EveRYBopy is for reducing the duty on French wines,
except certain wine-merchants. As º the interests
of those gentlemen could º be affected by the reduc-
tion; but perhaps they do not look on port and import as
exactly the same thing.

REMARKABLE TRIBUTE OF SIDEREAL APPROBATION
TO MR. HIND.
---
UR old Friend MR"
HIND having intro-
duced another new
planet (the ninth dis-
covered by him) to the
notice of mortals, the
announcement was re-
ceived by all the side-
A real bodies with the
§ greatest satisfaction,
and indeed so greatly
increased the pertur-
some of them habitu-
KIEL has been com-
pelled to publish a
supplement to his Al-
manack, and to predict
the arrival of the Greek
) kalends, the destruc-
tion of the Thames by
fire, and, simultane-
- ously with these events,
* the extinction of Punch.
SATURN, in particular,
who considers that the
calumnious report of
his having devoured his own children had its origin in out, ignorance of the
existence of those children, as a group of asteroids between MARs and JUPITER,
and who is consequently delighted whenever by the discovery of such asteroids
his character is cleared, was, so overcome with joy, that no child. born
.# the past week will ever be injured in after life by this generally malignant
planet.
Many of the stars, moreover, feeling that something was due to MR. HIND
or his *:::::::: efforts on their behalf, resolved to call a public meeting to con-
sider the best means of º their gratitude. The PLELADEs, as ºi
the centre of the universe, kindly offered their rooms for the , purpose; an
MERope, whose marriage with a mortal caused her to lose half her brightness,
and brought upon her frequent snubbings from her sisters, brightened up again on
erceiving that her haughty relatives were disposed to patronise one of her
usband's race. The meeting was numerously attended, but excuses were received
from some of the more distant stars, who alleged that if they travelled at the rate of
12,000,000 of miles per minute they could not arrive, until 4,000 years after the
meeting had broken up. The GREAT BEAR pleaded illness as an excuse for non-
attendance; and it was whispered that mortification at the ill success of PRINCE
GoRTschakoff had brought on a fit of the gout. , Many of the NEBULE arrived
from a great distance, and were accommodated with seats in the Strangers'
§§ but we regretted to observe that their uncouth forms laid them open to
the silly remarks of CAPRIcorn, who certainly cannot boast of his own personal
attractions, and of JUPITER's satellites, who, though they are bound to amuse their
master, should have known better than to insult foreigners. In the Reporters'
Gallery the GEMINI attended for the Herald and Standard, but could only, muster
one pen between them; TAURUs appeared for the Conservative weeklies, and
SIRIUs (Toby is en rapport with SIRIUs, and always howls when he sees him.)
kindly undertook to report for Punch.
. After an absurd attempt on the part of a clique to thrust the sun of our system
into the chair, ALCYonE, who is at present the centre of gravity round which the
whole universe revolves, was selected for that important office, and immediately
called upon “her excellent friend MERCURY,” for the first and only resolution.
The facundus nepos ATLANTIs thus adjured, in a speech replete with eloquence,
moved, “That this meeting, viewing with extreme displeasure the practice of
associating the newly discovered sidereal bodies with the names of persons who
have had no share in the discovery, #'ſ. to call the nine planets, discovered
by MR. HIND, by the common name of HIND's Night Lights, as a small mark of
the grateful feelings entertained for that astronomer throughout the sidereal
system.” This resolution, having been briefly seconded by ALDEBARAN, was put
and carried unanimously; and, after the customary vote of thanks to ALCYonE,
the stars returned to their orbits; but not until the nine planets aforesaid
who, dressed in white, had been seated in a row on the platform, had induce
foLiux to take round a castor, and make a collection for their support. We
ought also to state that the well-known Music of THE SPHEREs was in attendance,
and gave great satisfaction by its performance of “Waga Luna,” “Qft in the Still,
Night,” “Rise Gentle Moon,” and other airs set for “Voices of the Night.”
When MERCURY alluded to the disappearance of two stars from the constellations
—HERCULEs and LYRA—these celestial voices sang “The Light of Other Days”
with much taste. Indeed, the taste for singing which SHAKSPERE ascribed to the
; is in no way diminished, for the whole meeting, on breaking up, joined very
nucely lin

Till daylight doth appear."

A GREAT ANCHOWY CASE.
“BURGEss AND SON,” whose name will go down to
sterity in a cruet-stand, have lately been throwing their
#. into Chancery, and an equity judge has been dis-
cussing the essence of anchovies with a gusto quite remark-
able. The barristers º in the matter have doubtless
erified the fact, that little fish are sweet, for the anchovies
- - ielded some pretty little fees to pretty
little juniors. Essrs. CAMPBELL and MooRE were on
one side, while MR. BACON and MR. Nelson represented
the anchovies on the other side, and counsel pushed about
the anchovy bottle from the Court below to the Court
above, with a determination to bring the sauce of BURGEss
to the very fountain of equity. The great anchovy case has
been already before the Vice Chancellor and the Lords
Justices, but whether the parties will carry their “sauce"
}. to the Lords is at ſº dependent probably on how
they may be “advised by learned counsel to go on, ex-
pending money in litigation, or “if not why not,” or “how
otherwise.” -
DANUBIAN HOMICIDE.
Hosts on the Danube's banks are felled
To please one man's ambitious whim;
And yet there is no inquest held,
No Hue-and-Cry raised after him.
His likeness, true, the shops expose;
His hair, his eyes, are in the News,
And every Constant Reader knows
How high he stands without his shoes.
But how he sleeps, of what partakes,
In food and drink, from day to day,
What casual remarks he makes,
The newspapers omit to say.
We know that he persists in lies
Of quite an inconsistent kind,
But not that any chaplain tries
To rectify his frame of mind.
For wholesale murder does not meet
The doom that waits the single crime,
The exaltation in the street,
The carricu-crows, or grave of lime.

To deck its slant or flattened top,

(Before MR. SERJEANT Eves, Assistant-Judge.)
Joseph GUBBINs, alias CRABB, alias Bloom FIELD, alias the Grinner,
was charged with stealing a pewter pot, value one shilling, from
the rails of a house in Millbank Street. R. SLASHER prosecuted, and
MR. CRASHER defended the prisoner. The case was distinctly proved.
The Judge. Now, JoE, have you anything to say?
Mr. Cºsiºn objected to the prisoner being addressed as Jor. He
firmly believed, upon his sacred honour, that such a misdescription
vitiated the whole proceedings. At all events he called on the Judge
to take a note of the point.
The Judge. I shan’t.

Mr. Crasher. It’s worth fourpence at least, but it is quite in

a Judge ought not.

Mr. Crasher. I have no objection, Sir, to your laughing at my learned
friend, in fact I do so myself ten times a day. -
Mr. Slasher. “All fools have still an itching to deride.”
Mr. Crasher. If the Court stands that, of course I can.
Mr. Slasher. The Court is sitting.
Mr. Crasher. Is it?
Mr. Slasher. Of course it is.
Mr. Crasher. Ah!
Mr. Slasher. Ah too, if}. come to that.
[The Judge joins in the repartees, which are protracted so long that
MR. GUBBINs takes off his shoe, and sucears that unless his
sentence is passed he will “shy it” (to use his objectionable
expression) “at the old un’s nob.” He is c ned to three
months' imprisonment, and the nert case is called.
THE PRICE OF A LORD MAYOR'S GOWN.
EveRY “family, man "... will appreciate the annoyance of being
Stuff and nonsense. The objection is not =
called on frequently, for “a new gown;” but the most expensive
milliner's bill would be a mere song—to a moderate tune–compared
with the cost of a “new gown” for the LoRD MAYoR of LoNDON.
In the evidence before the City Corporation Commission we find it
stated by MR. ACLAND, that
“There is an amount of seven guineas paid for a violet gown for the Lord MAYon.
In another instance there is an item of £17 for the Lond MAYoa's silk violet gown.
| On the occasion of the Duke of Wallington's funeral, there is a sum of £72 for the
Lond MAYon's silk gown.”
We cannot pretend to understand either the necessity for such an
extensive stock of gowns as the LoRD MAYor seems to possess, or for
such a frightful fluctuation in the price of one and the same article.
We know of no system of arithmetic or rule of three by which we are
to get a solution of the question: “If a LoRD MAYor's gown cost
£7 at one time, and £17. at another time, why is, it to cost £72 at a
|subsequent period?" We can . say that as £7 is not to £17, so
cannot be £72 by any rule or principle whatever.
THE CLEVER CLOWN NUISANCE,
SoME very, pleasing
horsemanship . . at
Drury Lane is being
marred by some
very obnoxious ass-
manship on the part
of sundry clowns
engaged, we sup-
pose, for the pur-
pose of marking the
contrast between
the stupidity of
bipeds, and the sa-
gacity of quadru-
peds. We have no
objection to the old
Astleyan Clown,
who is continually
wanting to know
what he shall “go
for to fetch for to
bring for to carry,”
but we must protest against the modern school of buffoons who, under the
ambitious title of “Shaksperian jesters,” or some other pseudonyme,
inflict their dull platitudes on an impatient audience. Directly a clown
becomes too fat to tumble, or too stupid to play the fool in the
ordinary way, he adopts the name of “SHAksPERIAN". and bores the
public with ić. lectures, which he fancies may be received as instruc;
tive, because they happen to be the very opposite of entertaining-just
as if a man ceasing to be an amusing fool must of necessity become a
philºsopher. - - -
The “clown to the ring” is, in fact, becoming a perfect nuisance:
and we only wonder that the horses do not become low-spirited #
contrast with those dreadfully dull dogs who wear the motley; It
would be quite refreshing to meet with a good old conventional glown
of former times, who would not be above asking WIRDIcomb if his
º mother is aware of his (Wippicomº's) absence from
home;” or making any other of those rare old imbecile remarks which
used to set usin a roar in our days of infancy. A philosophic clown
to the ring is, in fact, an anomaly; for every one admits the idle
absurdity of “Reasoning in a Circle.”

ground floor a degradation? Because it's a-basement!

sable condition is

Slums. But then
, what is to become
of the Slummites?
The low neigh-
bourhoods maybe

the low neigh-
| bours; who can-
not be disposed of
by fire and water
and poison, alon
with the bugs an
ſºſ rats and other
* vermin that run

7 more, legs. Be-
: sides, in spite of
all appearances to
the contrary, it is
certain that they

so that we can-
not, consistently
either with Chris-
tianity or common law, get rid of them exactly as if they were
black beetles. And if routed out of their courts and alleys, they will
crawl or lie about the streets, or, making themselves still more
unpleasant, die under our noses.
t therefore becomes necessary to provide them with proper abodes.
Suburban kennels and pigsties will not do, as it is necessary that they
should reside near enough to their work. Model Lodging Houses,
therefore, well supplied with water, and arranged in all other respects
with reference to the prevention of effluvia, have been suggested
instead, as intramural habitations for the inferior classes. To these
the only objection is their name.
The #º. who inhabit a certain double row of buildings con-
tiguous to andJºlº, with the Burlington Arcade would be, most of

ouses.
But there is good reason to believe that not only have the lower
classes the same number of members—in an anatomical if not in a
parliamentary, sense—as the higher, but that '. are really endowed
with essentially even the same passions and feelings. Among other
sentiments it has been ascertained that they possess those of pride and
vanity, which are not only exasperated by scorn and contumely—as
when they are called the scum of the earth, the riff-raff, and the rabble
—but also by contemptuous patronage: by all sorts of badges, whether
metallic or verbal. }. is somet i"; §f the latter sort of badge in
the term “Model Lodging Houses.” The expression is low; suggests
an invidious distinction of caste : a state of degradation descending
almost to pauperism.
..To meet this objection it is proposed to erect a building containing
little suites of small apartments, adapted to the requirements and
circumstances of the poorer portion of the people, to be called “The
Iudustrious Albany;” industrious for the sake of distinction; or, if
a more explanatory title shall be preferred, “ Cheap Chambers.”
Wentilation and Warmth combined with Comfort and Cleanliness are
to preside over the interior arrangements, and the external proportions
are to be regulated by architectural taste, whilst the rent, will be fixed
at the most economical figure. Investments of capital in this promising
pºtion, to any amount, may be paid into the Office, 85, Fleet

dingy canary, belonging to the porter, at the entrance door? There
may be a few play-bills, also, and some steamboat placards; does “the

What is the furniture that is inside the Monument? and where is it
stowed away? Or is the “Upholsterer” engaged to keep the flutes of
the columns clean? Or is it, his particular duty to rub up the Pano
rama of London that is viewed from its summit? There is no other
picture that we are acquainted with, belonging to the Monument,
...; the picture of ‘..., busy traffic across London Bridge,
and surely this is a picture beyond the “Upholsterer’s” reach?. One
would imagine from the fact of the Monument having an “Uphols-
terer,” that there were chairs, tables, four-post, bedsteads, curtains,
and a regular houseful of furniture locked up inside it. We shall pay
a visit to the Monument the first, fine day there is no fog, and bring
away with us an inventory of the furniture. In the meantime, we
should like to be informed |the amount of salary of this “Upholsterer,”
who has to look after a place that contains no Upholstery.

PERSPICUITY OF RED TAPE.
IN reply to a request for information where to get the Blue Books
which are granted to Mechanics' Institutions, “A PRQVINCIAL
SECRETARY,” writing to the Times, says that he received the following
official directions; that is to say, iie was told
“To make application at the proper season to the clerk of the committee, to be
appointed ". to the report of the House of Commons on Parliamentary papers,
ordered to be printed on the 7th of July last.”
This the “PROvINCIAL SECRETARY” wants translated for the benefit
of himself and other country gentlemen. The passage may be con-
strued thus:–
At certain times of the year, and between certain hours, which will
be appointed hereafter but are not fixed yet, º to somebody who
will perhaps be the clerk of a committee whic %. not at present
exist but will, one of these days, in conformity with a report of the
House of Commons on Parliamentary Papers, which was ordered to be
rinted on the 7th of July last, be constituted, if that report shall ever
e acted on.
The translation is rather longer than the original; but if brevity is
required to be the soul of official advice, the answer might º have
been “Arrangements have not been made,” to which, if ". urther
º were necessary, might have been added, “And when they
will be, Heaven only knows.”
THE DIGNITY OF TRADE.
WE were going to say that the fact of a noble Lord having passed
the Bankruptcy Court the other day as a horse-dealer, gives strong
confirmation to the saying that we are a nation of shop-keepers. But
perhaps a horse-bazaar or repository cannot be properly called a shop;
and though the horse may be taken over a bar, that noble anim
cannot very well be handed across a counter; thus, whatever leaps the
noble lord in question may have taken, it is clear that it would be
incorrect to call him a counter-jumper. His case, however, certainl
tends to show that we are a highly mercantile community, since it
exhibits a member of one of our principal families as a dealer in horse-
flesh. But the fact is, that business is practised by the aristocracy in
general to a very considerable extent. Not only do some of them
trade in boroughs, but also in rabbits, together with hares, pheasants,
and partridges, inasmuch as they sell game. They are not ashamed of
this, either: for they will converse about shooting, and not one of
them ever calls on the other to sink the shop. Indeed, to sink the
shop would be to sink the Island, and swamp the whole concern
conducted by ABERDEEN and Co.
“Salad for the Solitary."
WE see there is a book advertised under the above curious title.
We can hardly make out what it can be, but should say at random,
that the translation of it into plain English must be as follows:--

A Few days ago a case was called on in one of the “Superior”;
Courts, when an º was made to put it offbecause MR. BookIN
could not attend. One of the judges asked with very natural surprise,
“Is not the man in prison?” upon which, the counsel of the “man in
prison” got up, and admitted such to be the fact; but added that he,
the “man in prison,” was his (the counsel's) client, and that he (the
counsel) was perfectly willing “to accommodate MR. Bodkin.” The
accommodation of MR. Bodkin was, no doubt, desirable in its way;
but, as the accommodation of a prison is not always agreeable, we are
disposed to agree with the learned judge, who thought it rather

IN consequence of the success of The Lancers at the Princess's—
those same Lancers being only another version of The Discarded Son at
the Adelphi-the following attractive novelties are in rehearsal, and
will be speedily produced:—
**The Blower or BuBBLes"—being a new translation of The Game º:

(with new bubbles to be blown expressly on this occasion), by Ma. Charles Kean.
“‘The Family of the Why tº Caokens'—being a completely new version of The
Serious Family, which was so popular a season or two ago at the Haymarket. Theatre.
The part of the Reverend Aminadab Whyte choker, by Mr. Chaales Keas, in lieu of
Mr. Buckstoxic.
“THE Mountenank'-being an improved reading of Belphegor, as performed by
MR. WEastEn at the Adelphi Theatre. The Mountebank (so long as the public will
tolerate it) will be played by Mn. Chaales Kean.
“‘The Towºn of HAMMER-AND-Nºsirº-being The Tower ºf Nesle, as generally
performed at the Surrey Theatre, but retranslated and considerably improved, with
new causes and effects, and a long dissertation by Ma. CHARLes Kean, given away on
the play-bill, as to the period and costume of the ãº and a list of the bodies thrown

MR. Hicks's favourite part of The Carpenter by Mr. CHARLEs Kean.
“New versions of Pizarro, The Stranger, and the Maid and the Magpie have also
been accepted, and will be produced with all the care for which the Princess's is
distinguished."
Great hopes are entertained upon the production of the above pieces;

theatres before, they will be successful again. There can be no
fear as to the acting, when the principal parts will be performed by
MR. CHARLEs KEAN himself.

BONNET-MAKER'S DREAM.
A REAL SCOTTISH GRIEVANCE.
BECAUSE we think that the Scotch Lion is quite as comfortable in
the place which custom has assigned him as he would be in any other;
because we consider that Scotland will do quite well enough without a
separate Secretary of State; because we are of opinion that Edinburgh
should be content to rank as the second city in the empire; because
we are not of opinion that the dictionary of DR. Johnson ought, to
the vexation of the author's manes, to be remodelled on a broad Scotch
basis; because, in short, we are not disposed to treat the imaginary
wrongs of Scotchmen otherwise than with our usual levity, we are not,
therefore, disposed to regard their well-founded complaints with any
other feeling than our occasional seriousness. Now we have—we
cannot say the pleasure to announce, for the announcement is one
which we are grieved in having to make—we have the pleasure, such as
it is, of pointing out, and calling attention to, with the view of causing
to be redressed, A fºr Scottism Giſevº.
The Scottish grievance which we thus proclaim to be real is one
which, we may say, should be framed and glazed. For it comes before
us in the shape of a lithograph—dedicated to us in conjunction with a
daily paper of some eminence—representing the Glasgow General Post
Qffice; a building of two stories, in height, interjacent between MR.
RUTHERFoRD's cigar and snuff establishment, and the shop of
MR. RUFF, clockmaker; a portion of the party-wall of which last
named edifice is exposed, by reason of a very shameful circumstance,
reflecting the discredit of gross negligence and injustice on the Govern-
ment, and, indeed, the Legislature.
That injurious and disgraceful circumstance shall be stated in an
extract from a speech by SIR ARCHIBALD ALIsoN, which is printed
beneath the plate:–
they were compelled to leave it for two years and a half without a roof, in the mean
while taking no steps to erect a new office. The result is, that for the greatest com-
mercial city in Scotland we have no cavalry barracks, no defences of any description,
a Post Office without a roof, and yet, with an amount of wealth that may prove a
tempting prize to an invader.”
We will not say much about the Cavalry Barracks. Drunkenness, we
know, prevails to a great extent at Glasgow; and if the people there
are apt to be so disorderly as well as drunk, as not to be controllable
by the ordinary police, perhaps they do require dragoons to repress
their excesses. 1. that case, it is no doubt a shame that Glasgow
should have no barracks for cavalry. But that the Glasgow fost
Office wants a roof, is a substantial inconvenience and injury, a just
cause of complaint, a matter for strong and sober remonstrance; for
remonstrance as strong—and as sober—as Glasgow can make. A
roofless house is disgraceful enough considered as indicating insolvency,
but it is much more disgraceful when its rooflessness is the result of
injustice. . To expatiate on the prime necessity of secresy and security
in such a building as a post office, would be to insult the understanding
of our readers; and we feel that some apology is due for hinting that,
of all the works of masonry, that is the very edifice which ought most
carefully to be tiled in. It is, therefore, with all our power that we
would trumpet—if with a penny trumpet, though, in fact, ours is a
threepenny trumpet—the lack of a roof to the Glasgow Post Office as
a real Scottish grievance; and a very fº. one, particularly as com-
pared to the others alleged by Scottish agitators. We may add that
we sympathize the more cordially with the º: *ś inasmuch
as we of course regard the condition of the Post Office at Glasgow
as fraught with prejudice and peril to the general cause of letters.

* The revenue from the Post Office in Glasgow has increased, in ten years, from
£26,000 to £47,000; and, recollect, Glasgow is a city containing nearly 400,000
inhabitants, being second in importance to London alone. Well, the Government
first bought a building for the Post Office, for the sake of economy, so ruinous that
they were soon after obliged to take off the two upper stories and having done that,

THE BRIGHT CITY.
THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY has volunteered an epistle eulogistic
of Manchester. “Thoroughfares, are opened ”—says the noble lord—
“courts and alleys cleansed—drains and sewers constructed,” &c. &c.
Nothing, according to the noble lord, will soon be wanting to
Manchester to make it º the Bright City; nothing but—as
Punch opines—a little public spirit. “The #. may go hang so that
he buys our goods.” “Liberty, in its highest sense, is the liberty to
buy and sell.” “The worst worldly evil is a bad shilling.” A few of
these maxims do certainly still defile the moral atmosphere of Man-
chester, cleansed as the air inhaled may be from the reek of cesspools.
MR. BRIGHT’s hat, though covering a large, cool head, is nevertheless
not big enough to extinguish the turban of Turkey. “Great spirits”
—says JEAN PAUL– are buried under golden mountains.”. In like
manner, sympathy with a noble cause may be stifled in cotton-bags.

All round the neck for a twelvemonth and a day;
And if any one should ax you the reason vy Ivears it;

We have seen footmen who were justly proud of their “pins,” but
never yet saw a footman who was a good needlewoman. But we quite
approve of the advertiser's caution. Being a “good” housemaid, she
will serve nobody but “a lady with a ...i character.” This is very

With a dash of cayenne to impart a zest.

“LEFT-OFF CLOTHES FOR THE COLONIES.”
THE “old clothes” fraternity are advertising very briskly for left-
off clothes for the Colonies, with a view, no doubt, to a sort of Holy-
well Street aristocracy that some people are desirous of establishing in
Australia. Considering the many scamps that have attained to wealth
at the “diggins,” and knowing the slavish precedence that is always
accorded to the possessors o gºld. we may anticipate a peerage of
regular “roughs,” should an “Upper Chamber” be established at the
Antipodes. The old clothes movement, in taking a colonial direction,
shows a sympathy with the contemplated exportations of aristocratic
distinctions to the New World, at a time when the Old World is exhi-
biting a tendency to throw aside its old worn out habits. Among the
“left-off clothes,” we presume it will be a good speculation to include
a few “coats of arms,” for the use of the Antipodean aristocracy.
The Englishman's Castle.
“The Englishman's House (says the Proverb) is his Castle;” and
so it is, but then it is a castle which is subject to many attacks (such
as the House Tax, Poor Tax, &c. &c.), and which requires for its
defence no end of shot. . The expenses of its support are fearful—so
much so, that frequently is the castle swallowed up in its keep.

THE ROYAL EXCEIANGE CLOCK.
It is a common saying in the City and elsewhere that “Time is
money,” and we cannot wonder at the existence of the maxim, when
we look at the cost of the representative of time at the Royal Exchange
-no less, than £2005, 0s. 8d., having been paid for the Exchange
Clock. This sum is at the rate of about £2 7 per hour, taking §.
clock to consist of the usual number of hours, or nearly £40 per minute,
if we make a calculation rather more minute.
The cost of the Clock is made up of a variety of items, which, for the
enlightenment of the public, we subjoin.
£ s. d.
Clock - 700 0 0
Alterations - - 224 18 6
Bells and Chimes - 615 17 4
Alterations - - - - - - - 290 0 0
Recasting . . - - - - - . 650 0 0
Refitting . 124 4 10
+2605 0 8
It must be inferred from this, that after the Clock had been pur-
chased for £700, it resembled the donkey “what wouldn't go,” and as
there was nobody to cry “Gee Wo!” with the expenditure, £224 18s. 6d.
was sunk in alterations. As if the Clock itself was not sufficientl
costly, it was proposed to convert it into a toy by having bells º
chimes attached to it, which have already caused an outlay to the tune
of upwards of One Thousand Pounds—a ver pretty tune, no doubt,
but hitherto the only tune to which the Bells and Chimes have con.
tributed, for they cannot be got into play anyhow, The Common
Council, however, will not admit there has been anything wrong in the
matter, because “PROFEssoR AIREY declares the bells and clock the
most beautiful specimens of workmanship ever seen.” We should have
thought that bells and clocks were to be heard, rather than seen; and
that a clock, like the costermonger's horse, might be excused for bei
a “rum un to look at,” if it’s being a “good un to go” could be relie
upon. The approval of PROFEssor AIREY may be very satisfacto
as far as it goes, but until we can look upon the loss of £20050s. 8d.
as an airy nothing, we can hardly reconcile ourselves to the facts
we have called attention to. -

NEWS FROM THE THEATRE OF WAR.
OUR latest news from the Theatre of War is from Astley's Theatre,
where the War with Russia is being carried on with unflagging energy.
Last night the Russians had entrenched themselves in a strong position
in front of the enemy, and the Russian General, Wippi.com.B, turned the
right wing—a wrong one having been timed by the negligence of a
scene-shifter. The enemy were in position at nine o'clock, and a
French officer made towards a standard, which he eventually carried.
On Saturday afternoon a body of Russian soldiers received their pay
from the treasury, which is understood to be amply supplied.
In the evening the battle was resumed with great vigour; but both
arties eventually laid down their arms. The Russians were much
arassed, and set fire to Moscow in several places with bits of tow
steeped in spirits of wine. The city burnt with great fury for nearly
an entire minute, when it was terminated by a decisive blow from the
mouth of the master carpenter.
A POLITICAL PROBLEM SOLVED,
WHY are diplomatic papers called Circular notes ?—They are called
Circular, because they frequently arrive at no definite end.

OUR TOURIST IN PARIS.–No. 11.
“Oh, I say!”, says old MARTINGALE, bursting in upon the Tourist's
morning meal, “I saw such a stunning play last night. Don't mind
my weed, eh? I am not much of a playgoer myself, you know. ...You
haven't got any Curaçoa, I suppose? Oh yes, Kirsch will do, thank

Some of one sort, and some of another, I suppose.”
“Oh, I can’t tell you the plot. It’s a young fellow who goes away
from home, the reprobate, and falls into what is called ‘bad company,’
and one of the bad company pretends to be spooney on him, and it’s
all very jolly at first. He swells about and spends a tremendous lot of
tin, in the same way that Tom HiltoN and fellows of that sort are
doing now. Horses, and dinners, and champagne, and jewellery;
nothing is too good for him. And then, to mend matters, he takes to
play, and of course is extensively legged by others of the bad º

Shirty-per-Shent, just like fellows we know in town; and he comes to

it’s very affecting. Everybody cried all round the house; and, upon
my word, I couldn't help doing a little in that way myself. Now,

chink,” and smacking the sovereigns in his pocket.
More difficult critics than MARTINGALE had spoken well of the last
of that chain of dramas in which Lais is made the heroine, and the bad
or good side of her character is the point of interest. The Tourist,
therefore, willingly installed himself with his double-barrel in a
fauteuil boºstſ. and, was forced to acknowledge the admirable con-
structive skill with , which French dramatists ply their craft. No
wonder our practical fellow-countrymen are tempted to carry off such
capital ready-made articles, instead of being at the pains º.
their own clumsy originals, Equally, admirable was the acting for
ease, gaiety, an wer. At the pathetic parts the audience wept
# as my friend had said. , There was no shame or reserve. One
old ellow, with a cropped head and great grizzled beard, was quite
inconsolable. He mopped his face with a red cotton handkerchief, and
sobbed as if his heart would break. The severe moral of the piece
seemed to displease certain ladies in beautiful bonnets, who mur-
mured disapprobation. The satire conveyed by the piquant “chink

content with obstreperous applause. They had no doubt whatever
that Lais was quite as bad as she was represented.
Before the audience had well dried their tears by a promenade in the

Fº French pleasure-seekers find themselves in the full-flavoured
and highly-coloured atmosphere of London, and enter an hotel kept by
a lady in a straw hat and Highland kilt. (The fashions of dear old
England have, apparently, varied somewhat since the wanderer left
her shores.) To every demand for victual or drink made by the
famished travellers, the short-petticoated lady replies that it is im-
possible, ſ.". c'est Sonday. And the whole party come forward to
|sing in the pleasant manner of French vaudevilles, “C'est Sonday,
Sonday, Sonday,” &c., and make everybody laugh very much. Certainly
it was a perfectly good-natured joke, and after they had lashed them-
selves in the drama we could not complain of being tickled in the farce.
A nice old gentleman who occupied the next stall to the Tourist,
and availed himself of Monsieur's lorg.nette, asked whether we love to
ridicule Frenchmen in alikºmamºrºnour stage; and, being answered
in the negative, seemed disposed to congratulate himseſ that his
lºuntrymen were free from ridiculous customs, follies and vices.
“Pardon, my dear Sir : behold all the difference. Your writers are
spiritual and ingenious, but they want one thing—conscientiousness.
They care little for truth and justice if they can only say a good thing.
The piece which has diverted us both so much supposes an audience as
ignorant of us and of our manners as if we were Tartars or Japanese.
A sketch so coarse and unfaithful could not be presented to even the
least instructed play-goers of London. Forty years ago, I confess
when we had no intercourse with your charming Paris, the would
have received it with delight at the first theatre of the King. But now
they know too much ; and any of our writers who should set himself
to laugh at the grand nation without careful and candid observation of
them in their own country, would be only making himself ridiculous.
Now the more a traveller becomes familiar with the people among
whom he lives, the less occasion he finds to smile at their peculiaritics.
He discovers good sense where at first he only saw eccentricity, and
the material for mockery crumbles away when ſe attempts to grasp it.
And hence it arises, my dear Sir, that almost the only sure way to
raise a laugh in England against your witty compatriots is to carry out
and improve their ignorant caricatures of us.”
“Monsieur, it is impossible to say anything more true or more
profound. Permit me to hope that, as the two sisters recognise each
other's noble traits, they will never smile to deride, but only in
admiration.”

RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONISTS.
THE Russians are not commonly supposed to be revolutionists
though the slaves of a sanguinary Autocrat are just as bad as ited
Republicans. However, it appears that they have embraced that
revolution in naval warfare which is destined to result from the adop-
tion of Colt's Revolver. Armed with this instrument, these tools of
absolutism are likely, in effect, to prove the most destructive levellers;
flooring their antagonists right and left. ... Should thºse antagonists
ever be British, Tars, it will be a great disgrace to the Admiralty if
the º: sailors have no better, weapons than the superseded old
pistol and common cutlass wherewith to encounter the crew of NICHQ-
LAs. It is to be hoped that they will be supplied, without delay, with
arms that will place them on an equality with whatsoever foe they
ma be called upon to conquer; so that they may defy old Nicholas
...} all his crew, and repel all the other assaults of the enemy.
Tricks, but not Honours.
LoRD MAYor. SIDNEY, in presiding the other day at a meeting of
those very common people, the Common Council, expressed himself
excessively “anxious for the honour of the Corporation.” We are
delighted to have it in our power to relieve LoRD SIDNEY from further
solicitude, by entreating him to cease from all anxiety for “the
honour” of the Corporation, as we can assure him that the alleged
cause of his anxiety does not exist.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHERE IGNORANCE IS BLISS, ETC.
A DONKEY AND A MAYOR.
PLUTARch delighted in parallels; Punch takes pleasure in the like
intellectual exercise. Our friend of the Notes and Queries speaks of a
“vast quantity of donkeys” at Malvern (for at that favoured place
donkeys are measured by the peck and bushel). And amongst these
donkeys was, until lately, a very superior ass named, for certain
achievements performed in the cause of the late QUEEN ADELAIDE,
the “Royal Moses.” . It seems that the good QUEEN was wont to be
carried on the back of Moses—at the time simply Moses, and no more
—to the summit of the thymy hills of Malvern; Moses, no doubt,
inwardly rejoiced and comforted by a knowledge, or at least suspicion
of the preciousness of the burden (for he carried £100,000 per annum)
that honoured him : for even asses have shrewd instincts in the
presence of the Royal and the great. Well, HER MAJESTY being
about to leave Malvern, rewards the old woman whose property Moses
is: at the same time, with her wonted benevolence, inquiring if she
could do any further service, likely, in this world of nice distinctions,
to give—in return for the many rides on Moses—the old woman a
lift. After a while, pondering the matter, the old woman said—
“Please your BLEssed MAJEsty, give a name to my donkey.” Now,
as the animal was an ass upon four legs, there was no precedent for
bestowing upon him a baronetcy or even a knighthood: he could not
be called SIR Mosfs AsiNUs, BARt. — neither dubbed simply SIR
Moses. Otherwise, in the latter case, we doubt not the good-nature
QUEEN, calling for a bulrush from the º of Malvern, the donkey
sagaciously going upon his knees, would have been melodiously com-
inanded to “Rise, Sir Moses”. The four legs, however, stood in the
way of such an honour. Therefore, QUEEN ADELAIDE, looking bene-
volently upon the donkey, said—“Henceforth, be known to all men as
the ROYAL Moses.”. A peck of beans would, probably have been
quite as acceptable as the regal prefix; nevertheless, the ass—like the
ass of Peter Bell—
- the ass, with motion dull,
Turn'd, on the pivot of his skull,
His long leſt ear!”
The º was thus loyally acknowledged by the ennobled donkey,
and QUEEN ADELAIDE departed. Moses

Everybody would . him. “That roan
shall be my throne,” cries Hotspur. “For that Moses I proposes,”
cried every Cockney visitor. What was the result? . No ass could
bear to be so put upon. The ass died; but—it is said—has left several
sons behind him; one and all called, even as the sire, “The Royal
Moses.” But this is a miserable imposture—an ignorant, wretched
ambition, Asses—assuredly asses on four legs—have no hereditary
titles. There can be but one Royal Moses—the sons are simply
donkeys, and no more.
And fondon supplies a parallel with Malvern. Once upon a time
there was a Mayor. Now, this Mayor would take upon himself the
burden of the reputation of a Royal Prince; would carry it at public
meetings; would especially insist on trotting with it into Hyde Park?
And for what purpose? e—Punch—have written to the old woman
at Malvern, the owner of the dead Royal Moses, to inquire of her—

OBITUARY A. LITTLE IN ADVANCE.
DIED the other day, by Act of Parliament, that time-honoured old
nuisance, the City of London: very sincerely execrated by all who
knew it, its civic brethren alone perhaps excepted. , Though sudden
at last, its death, by no means, was an unexpected one: for in the
public estimation it was known that the deceased had long been
sinking. Among the causes which chiefly led to its dissolution, we
believe especial prominence must be given to its fondness for good
living. Its favourite dish perhaps was turtle soup, of which its con-
sumption was habitually enormous. We believe it has been even
known to devour as many as four hundred quarts at a single dinner.
Gluttony, however, was not its only failing. Its love of “good
things” was by no means confined to those of the dinner-table: for
its appetite for venison was more than equalled by its thirst for wealth.
We might enumerate many acts of extortion by which its existence
was rendered infamous., . The blackest of these however was, we
think, its coal-tax; of which its imposition was regarded as such, In
more than one sense of the substantive, being justly complained of, as
a burning shame, by all who suffered from it.
Another ſailing of the deceased, was its utter want of taste—in
everything but what had emanated from the kitchen. Of this the
strongest instance was its strenuous upholding, of Temple Bar: an
ugly structure, but for the keeping up of which ple had to pay
pretty, handsomely. Nor was its sense of smell less impaired, ap-
yarently, than that of taste: as was shown especially by the strange
egree of fondness it evinced for Smithfield Market, although that
place was continually in bad odour. -
Throughout its existence, the deceased was extremely subject to
fits – of indiscretion—which it is thought materially impaired its con-
Perhaps the most distressing of these was that which
annually recurred on the 9th of November, when it experienced for
hours a congestion of its arteries, which seriously impeded its vital
circulation. In some of its later paroxysms, the deceased so far forgot
itself as to betray a slight attention to the Arts, to which it previously
had maintained the most complete indifference—except, indeed, to
that which we now see daily advertised as the “Art of #.
It is expected that the funeral will take place in the middle of next
week, when the Loºp Mayor of course will officiate as Chief Mourner.
Service will be performed by one of the Sheriffs, whose officers have
long discharged that duty. We are not aware that any monument will
be erected to the deceased, though a column to its memory will
probably be placed in the pages of our contemporaries.
Temple-Bar must be Removed.
THE past week affords another argument for the removal of Temple-
Bar. On Tuesday last, a distinguished Alderman having to go west,
was stopped by the fog at Temple-Bar. Fog and alderman were both
so thick, it was impossible that both could jº through together. We
have not heard how the dilemma was settled.

THE “grandeur of the law,” however obvious it may be
when represented by ermine (at a guinea a yard) and horsehair
at fifteen shillings a pound) in Westminster Hall, is certainly
not very adequately supported at the Judges' Chambers. These
judicial tenements are situated in the vicinity of Clifford's
Inn, and are, every afternoon, the rendezvous of much of the
riff-raff of the attorneys’ offices—for any seedy clerk is consi-
dered qualified to “go before the Judge’ at Chambers. -
Even the Judge himself appears to adapt his costume to his
company, for the scarlet robe is usually superseded by the

VISIT OF THE THAMES AND MEDWAY
to The
ROYAL COMMISSIONERS ON THE CITY.
The inhabitants of Parliament Street were lately thrown into a
state of great excitement by the º of a lady and gentleman
who came out of one of the lanes leading from the river, and aske
eyery one whom they, met to show them where the Royal Commis.
sioners were sitting. The gentleman, who rather surlily informed the
too curious crowd that he was Fºrmer ThAMEs, was attired in a
quaint and singular garb. “All round his head” he wore, not merely
“a green willow,” but a profusion of reeds, rullies, and osiers, whilst
his feet and legs were thickly coated with mud and sand, which
made, one of the bystanders (à Common Councilman on his way to
the Commissioners) observe, that “the stranger's lower extremities
were most in need of the hosiers.” His waist was º by a quantit
of bricks, beams, planks, and piles, strung round him j.any regar
to order or symmetry, and, by their bulk and weight, greatly impeding
his progress. He carried his well-known urn under his arm, like an opera
hat; but, on passing a window in which RANsoxie's Patent Filters were
exposed for sale, he looked wistfully at them, and observed to his com-
}. that he should like to swop the urn against one. A Kentish
armer (one of a deputation who had been explaining to the Home
Secretary the connection between the Bank Charter and the disease in
the hops) recognised in the lady an old friend named MEpway, who is
in the habit of staying on his estate for some months in every year.
She had dressed her, head with wild-flowers of every hue; her gown
was a blue watered silk; and from her waist hung, by way of châte ine,
a string of locks. A number of keys graced her companion's girdle,
but we are unable to say if his quays belonged to her locks.
Upon the introduction of these illustrious characters to the Royal
Commissioners, the usual question—“Have you anything to say about
the Corporation?”—was put to them, and #. Tha MEs at once
gave his evidence, in his usual flowing style:—
“Had for many years been committed to the care of the Corporation,
but had received at their hands nothing but ill treatment. mein-
bered that many aquatic plants once adorned the whole course of his

reed grass with an oat-like pannicle, and a great, pond-weed with
pellucid leaves. Believed that the same locality could not now producq
a reed worth a rush. Remembered that salmon, lampreys, mullet
and other fish, used to ascend his stream above Westminster, until
the Corporation suffered that stream to be polluted by various
abominations. Never saw any fish now, excepting those which
were thrown in, dead, by the clerk of the markets. Had heard of
Whitebait; but had never seen any. Believed them to be no fish;
but a composition of lard, flour, and gold-beaters’ skin. Had some
Swans still, but they never sang now. Did not think any one would
listen to them if they did, as ‘The Song of the Turtle' had superior
attractions. Remembered to have heard three of them singing
“Water parted from the Sea,” to MR. Pope, one evening, at Twick-
enham. On another occasion, had heard Taylor, the Water Poet,
trying to teach them ‘A Boat, a Boat unto the Ferry.' Believed they
ceased to sing when the City gave up its poet laureate. Thought
there should be Writers to the Cygnet in London, as well as in Edin-
burgh, but they must not write in Scotch, as the swans would sing no
Scotch song, except, perhaps, “Wha’ll buy Caller Herrin P”. Had not
seen a Naiad for many years, and thought the last had emigrated to
Ball's Pond, and set up as a clear starcher. Had been much reduced
in size by these and other troubles, but regretted to say the Corporation
had taken advantage of his diminished channel to build upon his sides.
Had been accused of shifting his bed. So would the Corporation, if
their bed had been filled with mud and shingle. Thought they should
have kept his bed cleaner. Would like to alter the old proverb, for
#. ºft, and wished that ‘as they had made his bed, so they might
ie in it.’”
FATHER THAMEs having concluded his evidence, his sister MEDway
was about to offer her statement of grievances, when an usher an-
nounced that the WATER BAILIFF was coming up stairs. Upon
which the two rivers, with fear and perturbation in their counte-
nances, scuttled out of a side door in dread of meeting that terrible
functionary.
A Bad Spec.
NEws has arrived that “the Russians had invested Giurgevo, but
were not strong enough, to attack.” We can only say that the
“investment” must have been rather an unprofitable affair.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
THE EXCHANGE CHIMES.
R. PUNCH is happy to announce
that the difficulties which have
so long prevented the Royal
Exchange Chimes from being
completed have been removed,
and that the following airs,
appropriate to the present con-
dition of C.ty politics, will im-
mediately be heard from the
GREshAM tower. The con-
tractor gives hopes that the
new year will be played in
by them.
The Days of other
Mayors.
Ain.—“The Light of other Days.”
The days º other Mayors have
aſled,
And Aldermen are past;
The Cit who hopes to do as
ey did,
Is hoping much too fast.
For London dooms the clique
to ruin,
She’ll mind her own affairs;
And the Mansion House see
no renewing
The days of other Mayors.
Those Gresham Chimes.
AIR.—"Evening Bells."
Those GREshAM Chimes, those GREshAM Chines!
They take us back to TUDOR times,
When Merchant Princes felt no shame
To bear a civic magnate's name.
That name has sunk below disdain,
No GRESHAM dons the civic chain,
A Merchant Prince as soon would wear
The garb of Beadle as of Mayor.
But Mayors and such will soon be gone,
A new régime is coming on;
We’ll hope to hear, in better times,
Some GREshAM hailed by GRESHAM Chimes.
The Curfew.
AIR.—“The Curfew tolls the knell of parting day.”
THE Curfew tolls the knell of those whose day
done—those greedy “creatures on our lee”—
Woe to the burly phalanx so au fait
At hiding callipash and callipee
E'en Gog himse
looks lively with affright,
And MAGoG scarce his spike-stuck weapon holds;
For CoRNEWALL LEwis sits, prepared to write,
And PATTEsoN an awful scrolſ unfolds.
Lament of Lord Mayor's Day.
AIR.—" Woodpecker."
I KNEw by the smile that derisively curled
On the
ATTESON lip, that my downfall was near,
When he said, “I can't see the least use in the world
Of that gew-gaw procession
My half-hearted advocate feeb
F. mount every year.”
y replied,
About wantonly sapping the customs of yore—
But I said, “If there’s peace to be found in Cheapside,
I shan’t be disturbing it many times more.”
PENAL DANCING FOR THE PROTECTION
OF WOMEN.
IN a quadrille—composed, we think, by the ingenious M. JULLIEN-
a lively and diverting effect is produced by the cracking of a whip,
which forms an accompaniment of the tune which the company are
"Wºº to dance to. - - -
ILLIAM CURTIs, a tailor, according to the Police Reports, was
brought the other day, before the Lord MAYor, at the Mansion
House, for having cruelly beaten and attempted to murder his wife;
who stated on evidence—which was corroborated by a policeman—that
he ripped up her stays with a penknife, took the bone out of them,
and beat her with the bone till it broke in three pieces; then beat her
with her hair-brush, dragged her out of bed, tried to strangle her,
and beat her again with a large square-cut stick-declaring that if she
dared to call out for assistance he would dance upon her body,
The quadrille above-mentioned supplies a hint in regard to MR.
CURTis's notion of a dance. MR. WILLIAM CURtis is an uneducated
man. He has not been taught how to behave himself to the gentler
sex. He wants a little instruction in deportment, to which dancing
should be added, as his ideas concerning that accomplishment are
evidently barbarous. MR. CURTIs should iº. been sent to MR. CAL-
graft's Dancing Academy, and there have been taught to dance with
fººd heels to the smack of the lash resounding on his own bare
ack.
The Lord MAYoR consigned MR. CURTIs to Holloway. Prison and
hard labour for six months, to give him, as his Lordship said, an
opportunity for reflection and repentance. But the dancing lessons—
two, or even three, perhaps, would not have been too many-were
wanting to render the reflection profitable and the repentance sincere.
They would have given him an opportunity for reflecting on the nature
of stripes and blows, and for repenting of having inflicted such injuries
on a Woman.
Another tailor, JAMES WRIGHT, also brought before the Lond
MAyor on the same day for the like º hit his wife twice on
the head with a sleeveboard, cutting open her skull in three places,
had struck her with his fist in the face, and continued to knock her
about for three or four minutes. At the Thames Police Office, likewise
on the same day, JAMES CROPLEY, a Lancashire collier, was charged
with committing an assault upon his wife, which consisted in felling
her to the earth by dealing her a blow in the face with a heavy stick
that knocked her nose flat. Six months' imprisonment and hard labour
only, were the sentences on these gentlemen also. No blame to the
MAYor or the Magistrate. The law at present unfortunately does not
empower them to enter such savages at the School of Correction for
the extra of penal ºf: - - -
Since these cases, others of similar atrocity have occu and
continue to occur so frequently as to suggest the existence of a down-
right, mania for wife-beating. In other forms of mania the whip has
happily been disused; but it is the only cure for this. There is clearly
no other help. Cure?—preventive we should rather say. Dastards—
with the fear of the ºf; before their eyes—have ceased to assail
the Ro ...'. and would very soon begin to respect that of the
mere female subject. Thus the possibility of being whipped would
restrain them, from rendering themselves liable to whipping; a con-
sideration which quite conquers the repugnance one feels at the thought
of lashing a human being if such a phrase can be applied to a brute.
Whipcord, therefore, would never, probably, have to whistle, or thong
to crack, to the howl of any such"ruña, after all: but, if occasion
were given for such music, we must say our ears would not be too
delicate to bear it.
The present Home SECRETARY is evidently determined to keep his
department in order, and may doubtless be depended upon for making
Home tolerable to a poor woman, in as far as he can, by warranting her
such protection as a cat-o'-nine-tails can afford against the ferocity of
a brutal husband.
That's the Way the Money Goes.
A LAw-suit has lately been reported in all the papers, with the
appropriate heading of “Money rersus Money.” Čºnsidering that
aw is generally the madness of many for the gain of the few—namely
the lawyers—we think Money against Money would be a good title to
almost every cause that is tried.
What do the Bells say?
The people want gardens, -
Townsfolk look palely,
Not if they’re rich, -
Then they come out to me, .
Or with me take a bed, . .
But in close London dwellings,
How do they draw breath? .
Bless'd if I know, -
Says the bells of St. Martin's.
Says the bells of Old Bailey.
Says the bells of Shoreditch.
Says the bells of Chel-sea.
Says the bells of Hampstead.
Says the bells of St. Helen's.
Says the bells of St. Faith.
Says the Great Bell of Bow.
THE LORDSHIP OF LONDON.
THE pageant of the “LoRD or MISRULE” was one of the zanyisms
of the middle ages. The thing, if not the name, still survives in the
LoRD MAYor's Show.
A, DECIDED Fool.-The man is a fool who, when asked for his
candid opinion, gives it.

THE SCOTCH PEERAGE IN PERIL.
CoTLAND, having begun
to complainofits wrongs,
seems in danger of being
inundated by incessant
showers of grievances.
We cannot be surprised
that Scotland should
itch to have her injuries
redressed; and we have
now another to add to
the long catalogue of
complaints that have
recently issued from the
North Britishers. The
following paragraph
from the Spectator of
last week brings to light
a new calamity:-
“The floor of the picture
gallery in Holyrood Palace is
become so rotten and unsafe,
that when Peers assemble to
elect a representative, the
greatest caution is requisite
to prevent disaster. The
Commissioners of Woods and
Forests are about to provide
the proper remedy of a new
floor.”
It is evident from the above account, that there is something very rotten, in
the foundation which the Scotch Peers have to rest upon. It wºuld, seem that
when the Scotch lairds assemble to elect a representative, they are obliged to “tread
softly,” not because theirs is “hallowed ground,” but because it is crumbling º
like the rottenest specimen of a Pierage which the banks of the Thames, with
its tottering tiers of worn-out barges, could furnish. We can imagine the heavy
Scotch Peers proceeding to an election with such caution, as to be compelled to
avoid every hole in the floor, lest any of them should inadvertently put their foot
in it. We shall not be surprised to hear, some day, that when the members had
assembled on the floor of the house for the despatch of lusiness, they went com-
pletely through with it.
THE “ FUSION’ OF THE BEERBUNG COUSINS.
(From our Rotherhithe Correspondent.)
“I HASTEN to inform you of an event, which, if the estimate of the actors them-
selves is to be taken, will cause the utmost excitement throughout this country
and the Continent. On this subject your readers will be judges—in, a petty
locality small things seem large—, and the preternatural importance which is here
given to it may deceive me into false calculations.
“You, like the rest of the world, are well aware that a feud of no ordinary
virulence has subsisted between the elder and younger branches of the house
of BEERBUNG, which so long supplied all the Publicans (and a good many of the
sinners) to this locality, and indeed dictated to the magistrates d; Limehouse, and
deſied the authorities of the Commercial Docks. , You remember, that when Lewis
BEERBUNg lost his licence, and the “King's Head’ was shut up, things went on any-
how in the parish; , everybody opened public-houses, keeping, the shutters down
Sunday and week-day alikº, and at last we hardly knew whether our heads were
on our shoulders or not. Then the military came in, and we got on better; and,
subsequently, the other LEWIS BEERBUNg (who was given to oysters) and his
brother, CHARLEs, Dicks, had the “King's Head again. Digks took in preachers,
and cheated in his measures, and at last ran cſſ to Scotland; and then the house
was let to a third Lewis, who was son to the first Lewis BEERBUNg's younger
brother, a very bad fellow, of whom JACK. KETCH had the last accounts. The
BEERBUNGs were always a queer set, and this third LEwis, though a clever fellow,
could not keep the house (which he had named the “Pear and Umbrella”), but
had to run for it, and was made bankrupt under the name of SMITH. Then, the
whole affair was altered; a committee, was appointed to manage the house, which
had a new sign, the ‘Three Jolly Colours:” and since that the chairman has
kicked out the rest of the managers, and has got the licence transferred to himself.
The house is now the Bee and, Bayonet, and seems to be carried on to the
satisfaction of the neighbourhood. Very good order is kept; the chairman, who
was formerly in the Ham, and, indeed, sausage line, has married a very nice woman,
and tries to keep friends with the most respectable people about. Indeed, his
behaviour to a rich and rascally tallow-monger, who has been trespassing on the
land of some poor neighbours, and stealin their turkey, has sent up UNLIMITED
Iloo, as he's called, in the estimation of all, decent folks. Anyhow, he has got
jºid was the ‘King's Head,” and, while he gives Imperial measures,
will keep it.
“But as the BEERRUNGs are i. kicked out of the house, they comfort
themselves by squabbling with one another, and talking as if the question was
which had a right to the fixtures. SMITH, the bankrupt, is dead, but has left a
lot of sons. not bad fellows, but with very little brains among them. And there
is a cousin of their's, who at present calls himself SHAM-
Bore (but I am told is a real bore to any one who to
spend the evening with him), and he comes from the elder
branch of the BEERBUNGs, and claims to be the head of
the family. SHAMBORE and SMITH's boys have hitherto
been at daggers drawn, and making everybody laugh, at
their absurd quarrels. SHAMRoRE has settledj." outside
the parish, and is always sticking up placards, some of
them very profane, abusing Loo, or anybody who happened
for the time to have the King's Head.’ He lives at a
place called. Frowsy. Wharf, and behaves as stuck-up as if
the º belonged to him; sees people with his hat on:
and has got a lºft story about some miraculous hair oil
which he says will never dry of his head, Some think
he is cracked. The SMITH boys used to make all sorts of
ſº of him, and call him ‘FATTY,” and, when their father
|. house, they used to stone any one who went to
See in
lin.
“But somehow, SHAMBORE and the SMITHs have made
it up. Why, nobody, knows; but it is thought that, the
|tallow-monger has been at them, and has promised to
stand something handsome if they will unite to bring
actions of trespass against Loo. However, be this as it
| may, last week down comes one of SMITH's sons—who
|calls º: they have all aliases) KNEE MooRE—to
| Frowsy Wharf, in his best clothes, and all being arranged,
knocks three knocksºno more nor less—at SHAMºore's
|front door. He would not knock two knocks, for fear of
being thought a §."; and SHAMBORE would not let
|}. knock four, because that would be coming the swell
too much. Sham BoBE was Fº over the blind (which
had crochet lilies on it), but of course MooRE pretended
not to see him. The maid opened the door, and MooRE
asked if MR. SHAMBORE was im. “What name, Sir?” says
the girl. But SHAMBORE had bolted through the back
arlour, and was standing on the stairs. “What do I see?”
e shouts out. ‘Come in by all means; ” and he comes
down exactly four stairs—no more—and waits for the other.
MooRE will not take off his hat until the door is shut, for
fear the neighbours should think he's nobody, but he
hangs it on a peg, and makes SHAMBoFE a bow. .
“‘I am glad to call on the head of my family,” says
MooRE, kicking out his leg behind, and making the girl
laugh. SHAMRoRE makes him say it again, pretending to
be deaf. Then they shake hands, and the girl is sent out
for beer, and they sit down and drink bad luck to UNLI
MITED Loo, and may he soon lose his licence. And it seems
they have arranged that, if they can kick Loo Qut, and
#. the house, SHAMBORE’s to keep it for the good of the
amily, until a boy—a son of MooRE's elder brother—is
old enough to take the licence; and, to prevent danger, if
SHAMBORE's wife dies, he is not to, marry again. le
§." couple sat, a long time, and MooRE, brought in
Rs. MooRE, and they all grew as thick as thieves; and
when going away, MooRE, who was tipsy, said he had made
a bridge, or was going over the bridge, or something which
could not quite be understood. Meantime, Loo has told
the police to keep a sharp look-out on the cqusins, and it
will be wiry times for them if they are laid hold of.”
Two Great Questions.
THERE are two great questions which at present address
themselves to the political, mind, and they are both in
connexion with wages. Without entering into the merits
of either, we may say that in England the great question is
“How wages are P’’ and in Turkey, “How wages war? ;3
LOVE IN LOW LIFE.
WHETHER much love prevails on both sides between
husband and wife among the inferior classes, properly so
called, of this country, may be questioned, but there is
no doubt that the wives, at least, are much smitten.
THE PORTE IN BOTTLE.
IF Turkey can be enabled to hold her own a few years
longer, she will, there are good reasons for hoping, arrive
at a high state of civilization. There is little doubt that
the Ottoman Porte will improve by keeping.

Would CECILIA PUNch be eligible for the vacant situation of organist
to St. Helen's parish For Mr. Punch has heard that it is the practice
of many vestries to exclude female candidates from competition for the
organist's office. Need CECILIA apply? Has it been, by the parochial
powers,
“Resolved, that female candidates be excluded.”
CECILIA would be thankful to be spared the anxiety and trouble of
making an application, in doubt whether or not it has been predestined
to be fruitless. One would think that the church of a female saint
would admit a female musician—or can it be that ST. HELEN wºuld
have closed her doors against her sainted sister, the namesake of Miss

been significantly, rebuked by LoRp PALMERSTON, who has remitted

THE MANCHESTER SCHOOL OF POETRY.
VERY pleasing advertise-
ment appeared lately in
the Manchester Adver-
tiser, an advertisement
which all who are in-
terested in literature
will be glad to see. Here
it is:—
ANTED, A POET.—
A tradesman who wishes
to advertise his wares exten-
sively, wants a Gentleman
who can Write Advertising
Poetical Effusions with fa-
cility.—Apply by letter, con-
taining specimens of poetry,
to A 8, at the Printer's.
Though poor Johnson
or GoLDSMITH would
have been glad of such
an offer, some conceited
brethren of the goose-
quill may look with con-
tempt at the idea of the
application of poetry to
the advertisement of wares. Why not ºpy oetry to the advertisement of wares
as well as apply Art to their construction? Is not Art-crockery considered a great
thing?—and what is your School of Design for, but to supply us with Art-clothes
and Art-furniture; so that in good time we shall have Art-velvets, Art-cottons, Art-
muslins, Art-silks, and Art-satins, for Art-waistcoats, Art-shirt-fronts, Art-frocks,
Art-slips, Art-gowns; likewise Art-chairs and Art-tables, Art-fenders, Art-fire-irons,
Art-pots and Art-kettles, , Art coalscuttles, Art-paper for walls, Art-bell-pulls,
Art-pump-handles, Art bedsteads, and Art-washhand basins? The spirit of the
age requires that Art shall be turned to practical account. He that would prosper
by the poetical Art must utilise it. One way to do so, as good as any other, would
be to sing the praises of candlesticks, for instance, or knives and forks, or haber:
º or any other description of goods; what not? Poets have quite exhausted
their old stock of subjects; they want a new stock, and that of a linendraper would
be as good as any. The lines—
O heavenly Muse! the vast assortment sing,
Of JACKSON, JoHNSON, WILKINsoN and KING,
for example, might, serve for the commencement, and indicate the argument of
a modern Epic of the Manchester School. The place of the hero in the poem
would of course be supplied by a power-loom. But the “poetical effusions”
required as per advertisement would necessarily be lyrical. Here an abundance
of themes opens up to the bard, Suppose that the wares which the poet is engaged
to advertise are stuffs. It will not follow that his verses should be stuff too,
Leaving doggrel to the minstrel of Moses, he might aim at a really sentimental
treatment of his subject. He might, with the view of calling public attention
to a silk, write something of this sort:-
LINES TO ISABEL.
I saw thee dancing in the hall;
The beauteous robe that draped thy form
Had just the free and flowing ji
Of some old statue's; but, too warm,
Too glowing were that eye and cheek,
To let thy shape of loveliness
Like marble seem, though rarest Greek,
For all that chaste and graceful dress!
*...* At 16s. 0d., A Superior Article and Striking Novelty. . Now Selling Off at
a Tremendous Sacrifice. JAckson AND Co., &c.
The foregoing is merely an attempt to show what might be done in this line, or
sort of lines. It is no easy job, as a judicious ancient observes, to do common
themes to a T.
Perhaps it is strange, however, that a Manchester tradesman should have to
advertise for a poet. Is there no young man in his establishment that turns down
his collars and grows his hair in ringlets, and has joined the moustache-movement,
that wºuld answer his purpose?. Hiſ most large businesses there are such young
men, who let off their poetical steam in effusions to the moon, &c., and merely
waste it. Many of these poor young fellows are snubbed and ridicuſed, and thus
bawe their self-regard—which is always sensitive—irritated and mortified, till they
are driyen to all, manner of reckless and evil courses; whereas, by the useful direc.
tion, of their talent, rendering it subservient to the purposes of the shop, they
would be enabled to fulfil the aspirations that are in them with credit to themselves
and with º to their employers: provided they would pay that, attention to
their grammatical studies, which is necessary to the composition of decent verses,
even on the subject of a merino or a ducape.
THE REAL, AND THE IDEAL-There is as much difference between the real and
the ideal, as there is between a castle in Ayrshire and a castle in the Air.
THE EXPENSE OF MAKING A BARON.
Those who accept dignities are usually
for them; but, perhaps, if a man has “greatness thrust
upon him” in the form of a title, it would be rather hard
to make him pay £420 for an “honour” of which he was
not solicitous. Defore a man can be “dubbed” a knight
he must “dub up ’’ some £200; but it seems to cost
between £400 and £500 to make a baron. Last year LoBD
FITzRoy SoMERSET was changed into LoRD RAGLAN–a
conversion which, though, it might have been managed as
easily and as cheaply as the pantomime trick of So-AND-So
afterwards IHARLEQUIN, or PANTALOON, or CLowN, has, it
seems, added upwards of £400 to the annual item of civil
contingencies. It is very “civil,” no doubt, to make a
commoner into a peer, but when the “contingency” arrives,
we think the recipient of the honour ought to be civilly
expected to pay for it. Perhaps, however, the better
course would be to do it cheap, and we should hardly think
the dignity of the peerage can be sustained by such charges
as we find making up the sum total of the cost of a
Barony.
The Clerk of the Hanaper, or Hamper, gets £24 13s. 4d.;
but why the title of Baron should be hampered with such
an expense it is difficult to guess, unless it is that the
newly-made peer is expected to, wet his dignity with a
few dozen of something drinkable. Deputy Hamper—by
virtue, possibly, of some bottled beer—gets a guinea; and
the “porter to the Great Seal”, has another guinea; but,
whether the word “porter” applies to some officers, or to
some beer for the LoRD CHANCELLOR's department, we
have no means of knowing. The sealing of the patent is
a. costly affair, including “Sealer, £1,2s. 6d. ; Deputy

10s. 6d.; ” from which we can only infer that, while two
officers are employed in the act of sealing, two other officers
are standing by and “chaffing” the operation.
. The “Royal Household” receives £104.6s. 10d.--for a
jollification, no doubt; though we suspect that this, act
of High Life below Stairs in the Palace is entirely without
the sanction of Royalty. , Our old friend “Garter” comes
in for £20, which is moderate, considering how invariably
the recipients of dignities, are tied by the leg by Garter's
stringent requirements. The bill winds up with one guinea
for the engrossing clerk, who engrosses very little of the
profit but a great deal of the trouble, for he was obliged
to engross the warrant and find the parchment.
It costs in all £420 to make a Peer; and if every
Member of the Peerage is worth what he costs, it is easy
to estimate the value of the Epº House of Parliament.
Our own opinion is, that the Lords would be quite as
precious without the preliminary outlay incurred in their
manufacture; but if something is to be paid on the occa-
sion, we think the money might be better employed than
by melting it in chaff, or any other kind of wax, and
º it in “porter,” or Hampers of any description
whatever,

A Tap on a Tub.
THE Morning Advertiser, speaking of Louis NAPOLEON's
new tariff reforms, says that he has effected them, “deq
to the howlings of the iron-masters and the scowlings of t
coal-owners.” One would not deprive the EMPEROR of
one iota of his merit, but we have a “random recollection”
that a “scowl” is a thing to see, rather than to hear.
We do think that our friends the ficensed Victuallers are
entitled to demand better grammar for their money. Our
JEAMEs would not have so written.

THE TURTLE BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION
rola
THE RELLEF OF DESTITUTE ALDERMEN.
WE are glad to inform our
readers that a Society,
with the above benevolent
motive, is in the course of
formation. We need not
say that, in the state of
extreme destitution to
which the poor Aldermen
are likely, in another year,
to be reduced, such a so-
ciety, like every other so-
ciety that has hitherto
been started, will supply
a great vacuum. The use
of Turtle to an Alderman
has become a sort of
second nature; and when,
by circumstances over
which—unlike the City
Funds—he has had no
control, he is deprived of
that great humanising and
aldermanising necessity,
we need not say that a
very great vacuum will be
created in his stomach.
It is to fill that vacuum—
which, if filled by the Al-
derman's own resources,
would cause a vacuum in
his pocket as great as the
one that already exists in
- his mind—that a few cha-
lilable individuals have joined together in sympathy, and guineas to
relieve, the wants of a large luxurious class of their fellow-countrymen.
Until the prospectus, in due satin paper and gilt-edge form, is issued,
we beg to dot down a few of the principal features of this benevolent
association:—
PRINCE ALBERT is to be President of this new charity, if he will
only accept it, in return for the statue which the Aldermen have been
trying to get up in his honour, in the hope that they may be repre-
sented on the pedestal in some humble capacity—either as hanging on
to his Royal Highness's coat-tails, or else kissing his princely boots.
Counmittees will be appointed to visit the different Wards, and some
of the highest ladies in the land have been most eager in applying for
this charitable office. -
ºldermen who have passed the chair will be allowed their three
basins of Turtle a week. Those, who have not yet come to that awful
pass, will only receive their one basin, of the usual size of those which
a person pays five shillings for at BIRCh's.
On the 9th of November–the anniversary of the grand Lorn Mayor's
Day- the whole body of Aldermen are to be allowed, in addition to
their Turtle, a small glass of iced Punch. - - - -
A select number, also, will be taken in rotation, and given a ride in
flºº that will be directed to follow the precise route that
the Loºp" Mayor's procession was in the habit" of taking every
memorable 9th of November. Pocket handkerchieſs will be provided
gratuitously, to stem the grief of such Aldermen for whom the sight
may be too much. -
Negotiations are in treaty for the Mansion, House, which will be
unoccupied as soon as the City Corporation has died its unnatural death.
It is expected to be vacant in a year. A better log lity could not pos-
sibly be chosen, on account of the number of pleasant associations
that are, connected with that building, which was so proverbially
hospitable with other people's money.
hose Aldermen who are prevented, by illness or modesty, from
"Pºiº at the Mansion House, will be relieved at their own mansions.
All Aldermen will be expected to bring their own basins and spoons.
Any Alderman convicted of bringing up his basin to be filled a
second time on the same day, will be denied any further relief for an
entire twelvemonth.
The tickets, under any circumstances, are not to be sold; but it is
hoped, in the event of the expected success of the Association, that
measures will be taken to add venison to the Turtle.
Further particulars will be shortly published, with a list of the
bankers id houses where subscriptions are to be paid, and where the
smallest contributions, in the way of turtle or venison, will be thank-
fully received. . . -
A smaller Charity will also be established—at least the attempt will

be made—in connection with the parent one. Its object will be to
relieve the Common Councilmen with Mock Turtle.
It is a source of great consolation, to think that these poor miserable
creatures, when they are turned out of their comfortable quarters, will
not be totally unprovided for in their old age. Ruin, it is true, is starin
them in the face; but still their few declining years may be j
comparatively happy, by their being still supplied with those comforts
which the custom of a whole life has turned into nothing less than
}..." wants. To prove we bear no malice towards those who are
fallen, we wish every success to these “TURTLE Soup Kitch ENs for
DESTITUTE ALDERMEN ; ” and, as soon as the casseroles are got into
boiling order, we are ready to pay our first subscription.
SHORTCOMING OF THE CITY.
THE City of London is not quite PLATO’s Model Republic. It has
not completely, realized its idea of corporate perfection. Not per-
mitting the subjects of its jurisdiction to measure or to carry their own
commodities, it has established corn, coal, fruit, and oyster-meters,
and fellowship-porters, whom it obliges them to employ on terms pre-
scribed by itself. But it does not carry out the princi ſ: of preventing
individuals from managing their own affairs, by prohibiting them from
doing anything whatever for themselves, º it is possible that
somebody else may do for them. It has not established Civic Barbers,
empowered to shave all men who reside within its precincts, whether
willing or unwilling to submit their chins to those officers, and it does
not deny anybody the right of shaving himself.

AN INJUDICIOUS PATRIOT.
E read among the
speeches deli-
wered at the late
Polish Anniver.
sary Meeting, one
which was madeby
a foreign gentle;
man, introduced
as a friend of
M.MAzzINI, and
which concluded
thus: —
“Revolution was
called disorder. It
might be so, but the
only way to finish
with disorder was to
make revolution. —
(Cheers.) Therefore
it was that he wished
for revolution, though
its permanent success
involved the sad ne-
cessity of the guillo-
tine. (Great cheering.)
These daring
words were ut-
tered, not in the
§º of Leicester, but at the splendid
Rooms of that of Hanover. How proud, and glad we ought to feel of
our freedom of utterance, considering that at a place of fashionable
resort, in an aristocratic neighbourhood, an individual is permitted to
speak out thus: declaring himself boldly on the side of revolution and
|. guillotine! - -
Nevertheless, for the cause of European liberty, it is a pity that this
gentleman had not, either had his mouth stopped by the spontaneous
action of the muscles which serve to close that orifice, or shut up b
cries of “No, no!” substituted for the “great cheering” whic
greeted his avowal in regard to revolutionism and decapitation. The
use and applause of such language must estrange all friends of freedom
except those who are mad. The exiles that indulge in it ought not
perhaps, to be deprived of an asylum, but they ought to be restricted
to one in which they can be looked after. †. is bad enough when
atriots are consigned to the halter by despots, but it is worse when,
#. rope given them, they use it to hang themselves. The
EMPERORs of RUSSIA and AUSTRIA are much obliged to those who
talk like this foreign gentleman. The revolution contemplated by
M. MAzzINI is another thing, we hope, than that which is advocated
by his indiscreet friend, and to “make” which will, in truth, be a
certain “way to finish with disorder.”
slummish purlieus of the
TABLE TURNING AND TRUE PIETY.
A CLERGYMAN, the REy. R. W. DiBDIN, M.A., has published a
Lecture recently delivered by him at the Music all, Store Street,
upon Table Turning, which he ascribes to “Satanic Agency,” animad-
verting on all who differ with him on the subject; among others, on
ourselves. Referring to this periodical he is pleased to say,
“I will only remark that it is conspicuous (like the Times newspaper, which it
echoes), for its consistent enmity to true piety; —its advocacy of Sabbath desecration in
the Sydenham Exhibition, and the Sunday delivery of letters by the Post Office. And
I very much wonder that religious people support it as they do.”
If any newspaper discusses the questions of the day generally in a
spirit of common sense, and this periodical treats, them in the same
spirit, there must be a general, coincidence of opinion between this
fººl and that newspaper, which MR. DiBp1N may call an echo if
he pleases. , But he has no right to term Punch a consistent enemy to
true piety, because we do not admit that a Christian is bound to keep
Sunday as a Jew is obliged to observe Saturday. And his wonder that
religious people support Punch as they do may be abated by the con-
sideration that religion is not, in all people, allied with superstition, or
with cant and hypocrisy, Religion Punch has always held, and hopes
to hold, inviolate; but the pretence of it, whether designed to restrict
his liberty, or impose upon his understanding, he has ever denounced
and ever will denounce. Withhold from the child the letter of the
sick }. deny the fagged artizan his breath of fresh air and half-
holyday once a week, under a religious pretext, and Punch will protest
you a Pharisee, and
extricate an ox, or a MR. DIBDI
happen to tumble on the Sabbath day. And if lies or delusions are
propounded to his credence, tales, whether of table-talking or picture-
winking, Punch will not be hindered from laughing at them by the
circumstance that they are preached beneath the cover of religion.

Punch never knowingly admits anything into his ºf: that could

quote from MR. DIBDIN's ſº let an assertion that MR. DIBDIN
professes to quote from the devil; a piece of blasphemy too frightfully
shocking to be repeated. ... The following, however, may be cited as
specimens of the answers elicited by the Rev. gentleman and a MR. B.

rimenter; it also stopped when the Bible was placed upon it, like the
similarly º: moveables of Messrs. GoDFREY and GILLSON. At
least so he would have us believe, or be accounted altogether unbe-
lieving. For he declares of Table Turning, that
“Those who have not witnessed its wonders, and disbelieve (or attempt to explain
away) the statemen's of those who have, must be passed by as impracticable subjects,
acting precisely on the principle of the infidel HuME, who, because he never saw a
miracle, would have us infer that no one else ever did.”
This is precisely the style in which Roman Catholic priests argue in
behalf of miraculous images, and if MR. DiBDIN did not profess a vast
abhorrence of Popery, he might be imagined to be one of the clerical
correspondents of the Tablet. In another place he says,
“If any one doubts my veracity, or questions the possibility of my senses being correct
witnesses—in such a case I have nothing to reply to that person. Such an one puts
himself out of the reach of argument; and by such incredulity makes it impossible to
prove anything to him.”
We are called ..". to admit the infallibility of MR. DIBDIN's senses
as well as his good faith, although we have the opposing #." O
FARADAY, and although, whilst Table Turning is, as MR. DIBDIN him-
self says, practised daily by tens of thousands, there has been no one
satisfactory exhibition of the wonder in public, Punch has tried Table and
Hat ...; The hat and the table gave signs of beginning to turn;
which ceased, not at his command to stop, but on his reminding the
rest of the party that they were not to push.
PROFEssóR FARADAY, by the way, fares very badly at the hands of
MR. DIBDIN, who not only insinuates a doubt ...; the “spiritual
attainments” of that philosopher, but also uniformly spells his name with
two R's. He has also, as above, SocINIUs for Sočinus, and for Swe-
denborgian, Swedenborgeon. Perhaps he has derived his º
from tables, which he mentions as having been found to spell badly;
indeed, trustworthy as tables are esteemed in matters of arithmetic,
they have never been accounted authorities in regard to spelling.
ut MR, DiBDIN is not to be laughed at—although he may himself
hold up other people to something less innocent than ridicule. He
observes that
“It may seem very wise and great to laugh down a weak brother; but surely it is
neither kind nor brotherly.”
Nevertheless, it is not easy to repress, a risible emotion when we
picture to ourselves a party of weak brethren sitting round a table to
see if they can get the devil into it. MR. DiBDIN says it is necessary
to keep the hands on the table. Does the evil spirit, then, flow out of
the fingers' ends into the mahogany? and does MR. DIBDIN think that
he has acted as the devil's conductor P. We shall next have Calvinistic
clergymen making, pump-handles work, and turning mangles to the
same account as tables, by Satanic action.
However, it is certain that the dreadful nonsense in the book before
us was rapped, out either by the devil, or by MR. DiBDIN, or his
friends. If we had any doubt on the subject, we should give them the
benefit of the doubt; i. we are afraid that none can be reasonably
entertained.

GENUINE SENTIMENT.
“A PENNY FoR. YoUR THOUGHTS.”
“DEAREST, I'M Disgusted with My Bonnet !”
HUMAN COPYING MACHINES.
Every Body says the law has gone to ruin, and if this is the case, we
can only say that the law, has gone where it has brought so many
—or in other words, that the lawyers have followed their clients. The
“profession” must certainly be at a low ebb when it is reduced to the
degradation of issuing such advertisements as the following, which has
been sent up to us by several Correspondents, who have cut it out from
a Birmingham newspaper.

CLERK. He must understand Abstracting, Engrossing, and Accounts. Salary
about 13s., a week. Unexceptionable references must be given.—Apply to ——,
Solicitor, Birmingham.
We have been told that “necessity has no law; ” but it would seem
that the law is reduced to the last stage of necessity, or it would never
offer such beggarly terms as those specified above to the very meanest
of its myrmidons. “Thirteen shillings a week” is about one-third
of the pay of a journeyman carpenter, and less than a third of what
may be earned by many of those who are out “on strike” for higher
wages. The poor wretch who is offered thirteen shillings a week must,
it seems, understand “abstracting;” but we should fear that he might
try his abilities in endeavouring to “abstract” something from the
cash-box of his principal. It is evident that the lawyers, having been
curtailed of their power to fleece the public, are determined to take it
out of their unfortunate clerks, and i blood can be got out of a stone,
an attorney is just the man to perform the operation.

became such a dead weight, continually hanging about, and wanting to be carried
everywhere, that the Young Lady, not being able to bear it any longer, was really

including the value of the property stolen, expenses of prosecution,
and maintenance in gaol, at £26,500."
How many schoolmasters might have been had for
the money which fifteen pickpockets have cost the
nation?– and how many more than fifteen boys might

pickpockets?--and how muc * a sum than £26,500
would have thereby been saved.

THRASHING, bruising and milling are now carried to such

mill on his own premises. At the recent Cattle Show, our
attention was invited to a “compact hand, mill,” calculated to
do an immense amount of bruising, and to give a regular
ood dressing at the same time to a certain quantity of flour.
he newspapers are continually asking us whether we bruise
our oats, and intimating that if we vigorously assault our
corn it will serve us as well again, from which we infer that
every blow administered to our oats will be the means of
an extra blow-out to our cattle. We wish our agricultural
friends would tell us whether the bruising system would be
º to anything else beside corn, and whether we may
safely, in addition to bruising our oats, give occasionally
a black eye to a potatoe?
---
A NoM DE GUERRE.-The French papers talk of ABERDEEN,
A PLAN FOR THE SIMPLIFICATION OF
PUBLIC ORATORY.
MR., PUNCH, who has suffered so much from the inordinate long-
windedness of our public orators in general, and of our senators in
articular, that he can thoroughly appreciate the misery which it must
ve inflicted upon the nation, has, of his own free motion and consent
meditated and devised a scheme, by which the nation will be release
from the pain of hearing, and our public men from the labour of
uttering speeches; whilst the former will still have the conviction that
its representatives are taking pains to express its sentiments, and the
latter will still have their vanity gratified by the belief that they are
making a sensation. Mr. Punch has read in the works of MESSRs.
Huc and GABET (two missionaries, in whom the humour of RABELAIs
is combined with the kindly fervour of LAs CASAs) that the Lamas in
Thibet—who have more º: to recite than they can get through in
a day, without suspending their ordinary avocations—are in the habit of
emp º what they call. Tchu Kor, or turning prayers. These are
large but light cylinders of wood, placed on an axle, and inscribed with
a great number of prayers in Thibetian characters. The devout Lama
gives the Tchu Kor a push, which sets it in motion for a considerable
period, during which he goes about his secular business, and leaves
the performance of his religious exercises to this pious whirligig.
If Mr. Punch were acquainted with the Lamas, he would suggest
to them that by the help of a little simple machinery and the aid of a
turnspit dog, they might prolong their prayers %. a period quite
beyond the strength of their own ingenious but imperfect instrument.
But as it is, he contents himself with recommending that Tchu Kor,
or talking cylinders, shall be introduced into the House of Commons
without delay. So many of the speeches e in that assembly have
no sort of interest for it or for the public, and are dictated only by the
desire of the Members to acquit themselves of a duty to their consti-
tuents, that they might as well not be uttered at all. And as no
speech is supposed to influence a division, or gain over a vote, whilst
many give rise to much bad blood, and to endless misunderstandings,
Wol. xxv. C
prevarications, rejoinders, and recriminations, it would be as well that
so fertile a source of mischief should at once be dried up; and that if
Members must talk, they should do so only through the medium of
the Tchu Kor. - - - -
Each Member might have his peculiar cylinder, surmounted by a
bust of himself, and carved from that tree, whose properties were most
in accordance with the characteristics of his oratory or his politics,
Thus the cylinders of LoRD BROUGHAM, and MR. DisrAEII, that
ungent couple, might be carved from the prickly pear; those of
W. Newpºre and Mr. Heniev from the sloe; that of Mr. HUME,
the Senior of the House, from the elder; that of SIR. RoßRT INGLIS,
from the cherry, as he is the BoB cheri of the high Tories; that
of MR. BRIGHT, from the aspen; that of MR. BROTHERTON, the
Vegetarian, from a large turnip; that of MR.LUCAs, from the bramble;
that of MR. Cobden, from the (good) service tree; and that of LoRD
PALMERSTON, the universal favourite, from the poplar. Oh!)
The members might attend to turn their own cylinders, or the
“Turner of the House of Commons” (for the duties of the Speaker
would be at an end) might go round and set in motion the cylinders of
those whose opinions i. wished to circulate. . The Irish members
might be gratified, yet without § hindrance to public business, by
the simultaneous gyrations of all their cylinders; a number of others,
inscribed with the words Hear! Hear! or Question! might always
be kept going; and if any honourable gentlemen, chose to inscribe on

FACTS FOR COCKNEY NATURALISTS.
SETTERs are a kind of dog kept exclusively in poultry-yards, for the
purpose of assisting the hens in the work of incubation.
ere are curious couples to be met with in the natural as well as
in the social world. Thus Rooks and Pigeons are almost always found
in company; while the Oyster but rarely appears without a Swallow.
The habits of the London rabbit (specimens of which may be ob-
tained at any ..". are extremely curious, and interesting to the
naturalist. ough wild at times, it is easily domesticated, and will
eat from the hand as well as from the pie-dish. It frequents in the
day-time the tops of water-tubs and the bottoms of areas: while at
night it is generally found on the tiles. When pleased, the animal
makes a soft purring noise; but at night its cries are loud and piercing,
and seriously disturb the neighbourhood which it infests. Its ears
partake rather of the “crop” order than the “lop,” and unlike the
country species, it has a long tail. Unlike that species also, it is said,
in lodgings especially, to be omnivorous.
Salmon of large size may be caught pretty freely in the Serpentine
nearly all the year round—with a hook. -
The author of “Nasology” asserts that human, beings are, distin-
guished chiefly by the nose; and the remark may be extended to the
inferior creation, for there is scarcely a creature but has some promi-
ment feature for the naturalist to lay hold of Thus you may always
know a woodcock, like an inn-keeper, by the length of his bill, while a
woodpecker more nearly resembles an apothecary, from its keeping
bark continually on tap. In the same way, too, cocks are distinguishe
by their combs, and foxes by their brushes.
It is a singular fact that country cats have generally not half the
appetite of London ones. The voracity of these latter animals is
indeed prodigious; and hardly less surprising is the variety of their
diet. e have ourselves repeatedly known instances, where in a single
night the cat has been discovered to have eaten about a potund of beef-
steak, and more than three quarters of a leg of mutton; and we are
informed by a scientific friend of ours, who lives in lodgings, that he
has even met with cases well authenticated by his landlady, where in
less than a week her cat has consumed half a caddy of his tea, as well
as an entire bottle of his brandy. ;

CENTRALIZATION IN THE CITY.
WHATEveR may be the nature of the thinking principle of man, there
is no doubt that the soul of business, Punctuality, is material. This
psychological truth, has been judiciously recognised in, the practical
philosophy of the City of London, which has devised a method of
insuring the virtue in question, based on a profound conviction of its
materiality. Of Committees for General Purposes, MR. THOMAs
Rogers, in evidence before the Corporation Commission, stated that
“In order to induce Members to attend punctually the Chairman waits five minutes.
At the expiration of that time he drops his hammer, and them all who are present have
a right to dine with the Committee, but all who come after the five minutes are excluded
from the dinner.”
No doubt the attendance is generally full—at the commencement of
the proceedings as well as after the subsequent repast. But in case
the majority of the members are behind time, do the minority eat up
the dinner provided for the whole number P. Should the persons present
at the fall of the hammer amount to just thirteen, does the popular
superstition, that objects to a baker's dozen at the mahogany, prevent
them from sitting down to table in a party of that number? So
does one gentleman retire, or is one more taken in from the excluded
set, and is the fortunate, or unfortunate, individual selccted by lot P
These are questions that suggest themselves to most thinking minds,
though they did not occur to those of the Commissioners.
“Domine Dirige Nos’ ought no longer to be the civic motto. Con-
sidering their characteristic principle of managing matters by appealing
to the centre of the human system, the stomach, a better motto for the
Corporation would be “Medio tutissimus ibis.”

LEGAL CURIOSITY.
R. PUNCH has been unjustly ac-
cused of being hostile to the Law-
yers. . He repudiates the charge;
and, in proof of his regard for a
class whom he firmly believes not to
be much blacker than they are
painted, he subjoins a specimen of
an honest attorney’s bill. Mr. Punch
ers it to the profession as a
thodel, and is convinced that if bills
of costs were framed on its prin-
ciple, he should hear less of strikes
in the higher Courts—that whole-
some i. º which an attorney
is abated, and the roll lightened.

PALMERSTON PERPLEXED.
If the energetic Home Secretary had only mentioned to us—confi-
dentially of course—that he contemplated inviting everybody who can
use a pen-every goose, in fact, possessed of a quill—ſo write to him
on the subject of any and every grievance, we should have dissuaded
him from the too adventurous act. The daily, and indeed hourly
contents of our letter-box would, if set before his Lordship, have
convinced him, that the corrector of public abuses will find himself
continually buried under a Mont Blanc of foolscap, and enveloped in a
mist of envelopes. Lond PALM will have less labour thrown
upon him by his official post, than the Penny Post will consign him to
º hour of the da
e
y.
, however, remind º to lay down a rule excluding all
anonymous lette the number of those to which he is ready to
ive attention. Already one enormous hoax has been played upon him
awag, whº, under the signature of “OBSERVER,” has made a, com-
plaint t thesº ice of “charging the public with drawn
swords* Lord Mayºr’s , and turning the Poultry into a sort of
Peterloo. The Home Secretary has already demanded an explanation
from the civic authorities; but it has turned out that the horses which
rode over the people be to a mare's nest, while the only charge
upon the public by the City Police is a charge of so much in the pound
by way of rate, which is, no doubt, rather a heavy one. We certainly
acquit the police of the massacre imputed to them by Lond PALMER-
ston’s anonymous friend, who seems to have a little of the assassin in
his own composition, for he does his utmost to murder, by a stab in
the dark, the characters of those whom he is too cowardly to assailin
astraightforward manner.
NICHOLAS’S DREAM.
I wandered in a rosy dream,
Where Danube's waters pour;
And there I saw the Crescent gleam
Upon the farther shore.
When lo! it seemed to pale and wane,
And through the sky go down;
Athwart, the flood I leaped amain,
And clutched a Turkish Crown.
Oh! trust not visions, when, to Ill,
Ambition they incline;
That Crescent bright its horns will fill,
Whilst I shall draw in mine !
CURIOSITIES OF THE CATTLE SHOW.
THE annual, aggregation of “fatty deposits,” at the Bazaar in
Baker Street, has just taken place, as usual. It is, perhaps, as well
that the exhibition should be of brief duration; for, in these days of
“nuisance removal,” we are not sure that the overfed beasts might
not have been regarded as so many accumulations of offensive matter,
and ordered to be got rid of accordingly.
. The yearly gathering of agriculturists is, of course, the signal for the
circulation of all sorts of puffing. hand-bills setting forth, the virtues
of some new inventions for puzzling the weak agricultural mind, and
making a demand on the cultural pocket. We fancy we sce a
little turn for irony in one of the announcements put into our hand,
which invited our “particular attention” to an article called the
“Farmer's Friend,” which has proved an efficacious cure of fret and
cholic.” If the farmers have not yet left off fretting, here is a friend
indeed; and it is to be had as low as 13.8d, a bottle. We should
suspect that the proposed antidote to “fret and cholic” among the
farmers would be found, if analysed, to contain a good share of
alcohol. Among the “drinks for cattle” advertised at the Bazaar, we
find one of a rather startling description, which is recommended “for
the disease called Hoven Blown Blasted Fog sickness”—a malady
which we hope neither man nor beast is likely to be afflicted with.
The Religion of the Heels
WE cultivate sacred music; but until recently, from a remote period
of antiquity, we have had no sacred dancing: A gentleman, however,
has just brought out an “Evangeline Waltz,” which he advertises in
conjunction with a “Flirtation Polka”. The fº. probably con
ceives himself to have a “mission” to diffuse the Evangel of CUFID by
the instrumentality of capers.

HIM AGAIN This AFTERNOON.—FROM Two To Four.”
THE HERO OF A HUNDRED HURDLES.
Two gallant officers, a Lieutenant and a Captain of the Fusileers,
have lately been running a flat race and a hurdle race against each
other. The amusement was manly enough, and º unobjectionable;
though there is something at the first glance rather odd in the idea o
two British officers competing which can run the fastest, when we
recollect that never to run is the usual practice of our soldiers. We
are quite sure that the competitors on this occasion will never use
their running powers in the field of action, except in pursuit of an
enemy. The races were well contested; the flat, race being won
by the Lieutenant, who “beat his opponent by three feet,” which
seems rather unfair, as no man ought to |. allowed more than two feet
to compete in a running match. In the hurdle race, the Lieutenant
commenced well against the Captain, but was unable to run him
through—having unfortunately slipped in taking the fifth hurdle....The
incident is suggestive of a little parody on the favourite military
song of “March : March!"
Jump, jump! Captain and Subaltern, -
y, my lads, do you not tighten your girdles?
Jump, jump! make a fair start of it;
There goes the Subaltern over the hurdles!
Comrades shall many a day tell of the horrid way-
(E’en the bare thought makes the life-blood to curdle)
How the poor Subaltern—as his luck took a turn—
Pitched on his head ere he reached the fifth hurdle.
Jump, jump, &c. &c.
The Best Way of Making Way is to Take it.
SoME persons have such a taking way with them that “if you give
them an inch, they will take an ell.” Now we should say the Russians
had this same grasping manner about them, and if the Turks had
: 'ithem a single inch, by this time they would have taken the
arolan-elles.
THE GREAT REForMER of The AGE-To-morrow.
THE PRINCE, THE PIGS, AND THE PARASITES.
... WE think we have at last found a key to the flunkeyism of those
citizens who are desirous of ##. º an ALBERT Testimonial. The
recurrence of the Smithfield Club Cattle Show has presented the
Prince Consort again, before us, in the character of a prizeholder by
virtue of a wonderful pen of pigs, which proves His Royal High-
mess's continued devotion to porcine development. We all ło: the
effect of a fellow feeling, and we are satisfied that the “greasy citi-
zens” must entertain a natural sympathy with those precious feats of
princely care which excite so much admiration in Baker Street. The
Aldermanic mind would easily find an excuse for gratitude, in the fact
that PRINCE ALBERT seeks to give importance to the pig; and they
would infer that he who would aggrandise the ordinary pig would not
desire to make little of the London Alderman. For our own parts,
without wishing to draw a nice distinction, we can appreciate the
views of His Royal Highness, and though he may continue to fatten
pigs for many years to come, we should not attribute to him any desire
to see the London Corporation fattening on the spoils it has so long
been allowed to appropriate.
TASKING A BISHOP'S FACE.
IN the course of a speech delivered the other day at Southampton,
the Bishop of OxFord is reported to have remarked that
“There should be Bishops over the Clergy who would weep when they wept, and
rejoice when they were glad."
Under existing circumstances that would be a difficult arrangement.
What with poor curates weeping on their £70 or £80 annual pittances,
and rich pluralists rejoicing at the same time in their several thousands
a year, a Bishop, in order to sympathize with both, would have to weep
with one side of his face and smile with the other.

THE TROUSER MIND.
*=m HIS kind of mind struts
: Tººl about infanciful costumes.
It flaunts in vagaries, and
is always masquerading
its betters. It is a min
without any union, or har-
monious combination—
giving one the notion of
an Irish rainbow, in which
all the hues had quar-
relled, and resolved to live
apart. Nothing is too
broad for it, like a Palais
Royal farce. Its legs are
scored like a leg of pork
—only the scoring is fear-
ful, in length, so that
nothing can wipe it out,
like the debts a young
man runs up at college.
It is lined all over like a
zebra, and as the zebra is
the animal that is next
to the donkey, the descrip-
tion may be said to fit it
like a second skin. There
is about such a mind the emptiness of vanity coupled with all its noise
—not unlike the noise, which coppers, make when they jingle in an
empty pocket. Everything about it is brassy and loud-in fact, it is a
perfect ophicleide of loudness that is always in full blow. It gives
you, the headache to look at the owner of such a mind. Better
to be right, in the middle of the orchestra than sit next to such
a mind at the theatre; the one is the soft murmur of Midsummer
silence compared to the Cochin China cock-crowing of the other.
It never, whispers, but, bawls, like the waiter at a cook-shop.
The mind bellows, like the poor fellows outside RICHARDSON's show
—and the greater the bellowing the poorer, the entertainment, gene:
rally, within. Its presence is a continual jar—a jar of sour and
offensive things, like one of GoLDNER's preserves. How it swaggers!
One would imagine the whole street belonged to it. It cannot
sneeze like other people, but makes ten times more noise than an
sneeze demands. #: coughs to give notice of its arrival at any place—it
bangs the door to give notice of its departure. Its insolence insists upon
the ... of everything—the seat nearest the fire, the best bedroom, the
best cuts at dinner, and the best attention from everybody. It always
takes the wall—it never gives way to i. not even to a lady. If
she wants more room, let her go into the mud! It keeps its hat on in
the presence of its superiors; but this is done more from ignorance
than brayado, for it never, suspects for a moment that it has any supe-
locks of japanned hair, that descend like two pitcher-handles on each
side of its stony face; opens its legs, and admires its trousers with an
air of the most supreme satisfaction. The Trouser Mind rarely looks
upward. The head is to it a matter of very secondary importance,
excepting as being a block that carries so much hair. Its thoughts aré
all downward; and if a person is introduced to it, the first survey is
always to his boots and trousers, it measures mankind by its mether
garments. The other, half of the body is quite superfluous. In fact,
the human body would, in the opinion of the Trouser Mind, be greatly
improved, if it could be so contrived as to wear two pairs of trousers—
one above and one below—and each pair to be totally different. In
the #. regions, a thunderstorm of a pattern—in the lower, an
quake.
A Confounded Bully.
DID NICHOLAs mean, say, ye schoolmen so clever,
To entreat he might not be confounded for ever;
Qr, did he intend, with presumption unbounded,
To prefer a request to be never confounded?
The former supposed to have been his petition
There is hope for him yet in unfeigned contrition;
The latter’s past praying for—merely delusion:
Old NICK has already been put to confusion.

riors. It stops contentedly in the middle of the room, arranges its two
PROPOSALS FOR A NEW ART OF PUFFING.
IT has long been felt that all the old arts of puffing have been
exhausted, and the consequence is that some of the most renowned
masters of the arts formerly in vogue have retired from a field in which
nothing more can be gathered. The poet has departed from the Mart
of Moses, and the Muses that once hung round the brilliant jet of
Annes have deserted those extensive premises in the Strand where
every blacking-bottle used to be, as it were, a jet of the Fount of Castaly.
The harp that once in WARREN's Mart
The soul of Music shed,
Now mutely lies in WARREN's cart,
Or under WARREN’s bed.
So sleeps the source of Moses' lays,
So Rowlands' puffs are o'er;
And heads once wreathed in poets' bays
Are thumped for rhymes no more."
No more by stanzas, songs, and odes,
WARREN hi ing sells;
The van alone the carman loads,
The name of WARREN tells.
Thus Moses' muse so seldom wakes;
The only sign she gives
Is when some silly §§ she makes,
To show that still she lives.
. Poetic puffing having been blown to its utmost extent until the over-
inflated windbag has burst and collapsed, the oratorical style of puffing
having departed with the late lamented GEORGE ROBINs, and the
narrative or anecdotical order of puffing having been abandoned by
Row LAND AND SON, of scented memory, nothing remains but to invent
a novelty. Acknowledging, as we do, that “there is nothing new
under the sun,” we sit down on a day when there is no sun to be seen,
and on a misty morning in December we ask ourselves whether some.
thing new under a fog may not be perceptible. . From the huge cauldron
of pea-soup, which is . in the London atmosphere, we fancy
we discern something, and a new art of puffing is . to us in the
shape of a Proposal to combine the Commercial with the Comic, and
to establish on the ruins of WARREN's fitful lyre and Moses' muse's
measures a system of comic puffing, containing a joke in every announce-
ment. In order to show how the thing may be done, we give—gratis
-a few specimens. We will begin with a few jokes for Royal
1st. The QUEEN’s shoemaker may advertise himself as “purveyor
of shoes to the whole of HER MAJESTY's foot,” and he may also add
that “the good footing on which Royalty stands with the people in
this country is entirely due to &c. &c., who makes the QUEEN’s shoes,
and who sells highlows, &c. &c. &c.”,
2nd. The QUEEN’s glover may announce that “the affection enter-
tained by the whole nation for the Royal Kids is entirely due to the
fact that HER MAJESTY buys all her gloves of &c. &c.”
3rd. The QUEEN's R. may ask conundrumically: “Why is
Royalty in such excellent odour in England P Because all the scents
used in the palace are purchased at &c. &c.”
4th. The QUEEN’s hairdresser may—with a disregard to orthograph
which is allowable in a perruquier and a punster-hazard the remar
“that the true secret of the grace and beauty which adorn the hair to
the throne is to be found in the fact that HER MAJESTY's hair owes
its attractiveness to the hand of Nature and the pomade sold only
by &c. &c. &c.”
We could multiply instances over and over again. But as our
qbject is to suggest a new mine of wealth to those literary men of our
day who look to the art of puffing as a mode of obtaining an occasional
blow out, we shall not F. to forestall them in their labours, an
take out of their mouths one morsel of that bread which, to the utter
consternation of the poet, is now selling at elevenpence the quartern.
An Old Lamp and a New One.
THE scheme of the ARCHBIshop of PARIs for instituting a fête
under the name of Fête des Ecoles, to º: learning in connexion
with faith, is a happy one. Everybody will agree in the sentiment
expressed in his pastoral, that “Re º and Science are the two lamps
which enlighten the world.” And if by religion he means Popery, it
may be permitted to congratulate him that, happily for the human race,
one of the lights which he alludes to has put out the other's burning.

PROPHETS IN THE PARLOUR—GYPSIES IN THE
KITCHEN.
HEN SUSAN, maid-of-all-
2 work in the regular and
respectable family of
MR. Potts—small City-
man, with ambition under
his waistcoat to be some
day considerably bigger
—when the aforesaid
illiterate and super-
stitious SUsAN, wishing
to better herself— (a
vanity that is uncon-
sciously shared with her
even by MR. and MRs.
Potts themselves) —
gives ready ear to
psey from Barnes or
orwood — EGLANTINE
dealing in husbands o
every variety and at the
shortest notice — and,
giving ear to the pro-
phetic gypscy, gives her
at the same time an
opportunity to draw into
- - - - er lstrom pocket or
wallet certain silver spoons, afterwards identified by MR. Potts—his own initials
lovingly intertwining with the initials of MRs. Potts, with the family crest of a
rampant lion licking his tongue at posterity indubitably marking them as his
Prº-
When, we say, SUsAN weeps and knocks her knees together, in a
of terror before the worthy and respected MR. -
aroxysm
SIxMUNCE—and the indomitable
EGLANTINE looks callously innocent, calling all the stars to witness that “the gal I
giv her the spoons as her own goods and nobody's else's—”
When SUSAN is confronted with this alleged fact—the respectable part of societ
of which Mr. and MRs. Potts are such very distinguished members, shakes its .
and wonders how ignorance at eight pounds a year, tea and sugar included, can
be such a fool as to believe in a gypsey J. However, the benevolent MR.
SixMUNCE commits EGLANTINE to Tothill-Fields, and—with one of those paternal
remonstrances that have won for him the proud designation of the Father of
the Bench—dismisses the grateful SUSAN to her kitchen, MR. and MRs. Potts
with a sudden benevolence, which causes them some after astonishment and
tºngatulation on their goodness, consenting to give the creature another
trial.
Now at the very time that SUSAN was opening her homely hand, that gypsey
EGLANTINE might read in its hard page the marriage lines §the hopeful maiden
(who is to give sixpence at most for the glad tidings; the spoons being purely
an after-thought of the gypsey's own)—at the very time MRs. Potts in her parlour
is reading Raphael's Prophetic Messenger; for the which she-the educated,
finished MRs. Potts; for was , she not beautifully finished at Athens House,
Wandsworth –for the which she has, in the best faith and best current silver,
disbursed two-and-sixpence Ignorance, crieth out in the streets, and everybody
gives ear to her. Our Messenger has, to be sure, a more winning introduction than
even the smiles and musical cajolery of EGLANTINE PRIGDUCK. For it has a
beautiful picture in which the events of 1854 are brought out in bold red, and
blue, and orange-tawney. Louis NAPOLEoN is engaged chatting with BRITANNIA
-(who is a king him to run across and take a cup of tea in London, the British
Lion at her side manifesting no objection whatever)—the while a very hairy Savage
has a dagger upraised at the EMPEROR's back, and is evidently screwing himself up
to “the sticking place.” There are mourning-coaches going to “take up” at
Windsor Castle, with other graphic amenities significant of what must happen in
the year 1854. ...And for this the enlightened MRs. Potts (that gypsey is still with
SusAN in the kitchen) has given two-and-sixpence; and that too with the mighty
resolution of getting her good half-crown's worth out of it. Well, MRs. Potts
begins with January, turning very pale as she learns this fact :—
“The square of VENUs and SATURN denotes, severe affliction to a lady of the highest rank. The
tranquillity of France is di-turbed; much excitement reigns in Paris, Lyons, Toulouse, and Rome.
Turkey and the regions of the Tigris and Euphrates are sorely afflicted."
This lady—whoever she may be—has very sore afflictions throughout the
twelvemonth; but then RAPHAEL must earn his half-crown's worth.
In February, MRs. Potts is informed—(and thinks, with a shiver of little
WILHELMINA who has not yet had the scarlet fever)—in February:
“MARs retrogrades to the opposition of the Moon in the radix of the PRINcess Alice, and indicates a
liability to ſeverish complaint or accident.”
MR4. Potts has conjugal fears for the health of Potts, and resolves to insist upon
gutta percha soles. In March—
EGLANTINE PRIGDuck,
“The retrogradation of Mans in Viñao in opposition to Venus, also retrogade in Pisces, will
stir up civil broils in Portugal; treachery and conspiracies amongst
the priesthood are directed against the QUEEN and Government of that
country.”
Already, the poor QUEEN of PoETUGAL sleeps in the
tomb of the BRAGANZAs; but even RAPHAEL cannot be
always infallible; not even for half-a-crown!.
April is big, with events; or rather with one event
that must swallow up every other. MRs. Potts is a play-
goer, and with the sensibility of her sex, would “ten to
one rather, see the Corsican Brothers, than Hamlet.”
Therefore she reads the subjoined with corresponding
perturbation.
“Scandal or death awaits one renowned in the theatrical world."
This is in April Perhaps on the first of April? It
cannot be BARRY, the deathless Clown, who shall be
snatched from us? If, then, it should be the the the
“renowned"—but no we will not, we cannot think of
it ! Ha! haſ ha! Sardanapalus is himself again!
MAY is full of danger as of hawthorn. W can the
loyal MRs. Potts think of this?
“MARs hastens, as it were, to apply the torch to the train of evil he
has previously laid. The highest power in the land is grievously afflicted.
It is the earnest prayer of Raphaki, that the direful influence of
f Saturn on the ascending degree and radical place of the luminaries
in our beloved Sovereign's horoscope may be averted."
But this is nothing. “The highest power” is continually
threatened; a prediction that, in the days of QUEEN Bess,
would—we doubt not—have helped RAphael to the .
ibbet. Again RAPHAEL turns the penny upon “our beloved
Sovereign.” In June, he says–
“I DARE Nor fully enter into All the important significations of these
positions and configurations. I sincerely pray that the health of our
beloved Sovereign may be preserved, in which I am assured her subjects
will universally join.”
(Do we not behold RAPHAEL, on his bended knees,
“sincerely praying,” with the half-crown in his mouth P)
n July, however, our prophet makes merchandize of the
QUEEN’s children.
“Saturn transits the place of the Sun in the nativity of the
PRINCEss HELENA, producing a tendency to disease in the chest, &c., at
the end of June and beginning of July. The 7th and 8th are evil days
for the PRINCE or Walks, and the 19th for the PRIxck ARTHUR.
Their attendants should carefully avoid accident.”
These would have made, very “evil days” for our
prophet; evil as pillory and cart-whip could have shaped
them. But we live in liberal times, and the Astrologer
may turn his half-crown upon the probable diseased chest
of the little PRINCEss HELENA, and the threatened dangers
of PRINCEs ALBERT and ARThur !
MRs. Potts reads in August that “the King of NAPLEs
should beware of female intrigue, poison, or the assassin; ”
and-controlling her emotion—turns over to September,
where she learns among other not impossible events that
“great cruelty is displayed towards some female about the
3; MRs. Potts thinks October a little slow. “Public
writers and scientific men are unsuccessful:” and what of
that ? “The fine arts prosper!” Bother the fine arts:
and straightway MRs. Potts passes to November, when
“Much excitement reigns throughout the land; the long talked of
invading army may, under these influences, make its appearance, and
ere many months' the wolf will come.’”
With the intuitive calculation of woman, MRs. Potts
wonders where on earth she and Potts are to sleep, if the
Russians—which, of course, is meant by the wolf—is
quartered upon 'em P
But this is nothing to what is threatened in December.
MRs. Potts continues to read with—very naturally—
increasing fear and amaz ment. Fear for HER MAJESTY
the QUEEN, and amazement at things in generall “Heaven
preservel”—cries the prophet in ominous tones—“Heaven
preserve, the health of our Sovereign, and of her
people !”—ending with the new version of a Dead March,
set after this fashion:-
“Dark and gloomy clouds hover over us; and I regret to add that
during the year 1855 the significations are still fearfully evil. I carnot
at present discover one ray of hope.”
What? Not for half-a-crown?
make it three-and-sixpence 1

A GOOD HATER OF BLUE-STOCKINGS.
“If anything could increase my extreme horror of Blue-Stockings, it
would be the terrible suspicion I cannot divest myself of that every
Blue:Stocking drinks. I, fancy that the only, person she pays her ||
devoirs to—and those only in secret—is OLD ToM; and that it is as
much as she can do to keep her lips away from him. The suspicion is a
very ungallant one, but I cannot help imagining that when two Blue-
Stockings get together, they do love a good soaking. . In fact, who
was the goddess who first gave her countenance to Gin P. PALLAs, to
be sure; and her yº. origin was the result of a drunken frolic, for are
we not told that she came into the world during one of Jove's
splitting headaches: Now PALLAs is the ...i troness of all
lue-Stockings; and as a public-house is to this day called, in honour
of her, a “Gin Pallas,” it is not very unreasonable to suppose that her
protégées are addicted to the same terrible practice ... It is sad, indeed,
to think—and I only hope it is not true—that the Tree of Knowledge
should, with elderly ladies, be a Juniper Tree.”—Anon.
PHRENOLOGICAL ORGAN MUSIC.
HE Philharmonic
Concerts are tole-
rably good; those
of the Sacred Har-
monic Society are
pretty fair, but
there is a musical
entertainment now
going on, which,
if it realises the
object it aims at,
must beat every
other quite out of
the field. A lady,
MRs. HAMILTON,
under the title of
“Practical Phreno-
: logist,” professes,
by advertisement,
to give public
performances, de-
scribed by her as
jº illus-
trated by Music.”
The shallow punster will of course remark that he imagined that the
only organs *gºg of musical expression were those of the
sort invented by St. CECILIA, and not such as were discovered by
GALL and SPURzHEIM; except that the º organ of tune
might, perhaps, sing for itself. However, HANDEL may be considered
to have illustrated the organ of Veneration in his Oratorios; WEBER
that of Marvellousness in his Der Freischütz and Oberon ; BEETHOVEN
that of Ideality and the organs of the other sentiments proper to man,
in combination with those of the reflective faculties, in his symphonies
and sonatas; BELLINI and DoNIzETTI the organs of Adhesiveness and
Amativeness. , RossINI might also be adduced, as an illustrator, of
Gaiety or Mirthfulness, and Imitation, or the dramatic, organ., But
MRs. HAMILTON's music, which is to illustrate Phrenology at large,
and consequently all the organs, must, if it accomplishes as much as it
attempts, be equal to HANDEL’s, BEETHovKN’s, WEBER's, RossINI's,
BELLINI's, DonizBTTI’s; indeed to the music of all the great composers
put together. She must be a sort of musical SHAKSPERE—than whom
nobody else ever suceeded in giving illustrations of Phrenology, or the
philosophy of human nature, at large.
To illustrate the whole of phrenčío by Music in one evening must
be impossible. The shortest way . it would be by means of a
symphony, consisting of no less than thirty-five movements, if we are
to consider the “Love of Life” and “Alimentiveness” as established
organs. The latter of these might be elucidated, musically, by the
introduction of “The Roast Beef of Old England; ” for the former, just
now, the best notion would, perhaps, be the Russian National Anthem
turned into a fugue, to signify PRINCE GoRTschakoff’s troops saving
themselves as fast as possible from OMAR PACHA. But a series of per-
formances would be required by the extensive nature of the subject;
for any one organ, taken in all its combinations, might be played ...;
for a whole evening. Some of the organs are susceptible enough of
musical treatment: “Philoprogenitiveness,” or the instinct of paternal
and maternal affection, but more especially of the latter, has its melody
in the music of nature, as heard in the nursery, or issuing therefrom,
mellowed by distance—the mellower from that cause the i.e. The
effect in question MRs, HAMILTON (who appears to be a Scottish lady)
might produce by the judicious employment—it would have to be judi.
cious—of the bagpipes. “Acquisitiveness” rejoices in the jingling of
money, which might be expressed by means of the triangles, intro-
ducing the appropriated air of “Still so gently o'er me stealing.”, “Self-
esteem ’’ would blow its own trumpet, of course; the want of it being
expressed by transition to a minor key. “Destructiveness” could be
disposed of by a crash. “Combativeness” might come out in the
rums and fifes. “Firmness” might persist in a violoncello accompa-
niment. “Cautiousness,” slow and sure, would speak in a gentle adagio.
A lively allegretto would represent “Wit.” The music of Masonry
would supply some hints for “Constructiveness.”. There are organs,
however, which may rather puzzle a composer. No harmonious men-
sures that one can well imagine would give any idea of . Form” or
“Size,” and “Locality” would seem to i. quite out of the musical
Way.
Wils. HAMILTON informs the public, that she will lecture on living
heads from the audience, assisted by the celebrated MRs. CARTER
“the JENNY LIND of Scotland.” Hence, it seems that the music wi
be, partly at least, vocal. It may be surmised that MRs. HAMILTON's
lecture consists principally of recitative, which would be more
suitable than an aria, a bravura, a canzonet, or a part in a duet,
to the statement of anatomical and physiological facts. MRS, CARTER,
we are told, will sing Scotch, Eng §. and Irish songs. There is an
Irish, song called “Donnybrook, Fair,” which alludes strongly to the
shillelagh, and may therefore be conceived to be very pertinent to
bumps. England, doubtless, has ballads adapted to various organs
besides the grinding; and in addition to “John Anderson my Jo,” and
many other songs of the affective faculties, there is a particular Scotch
song that might be very useful to a lecturer on, Phrenology. , MRS.
HAMILTON, in lecturing on living heads, may be obliged to describe the
upper story of some gentleman as being similar in its build to that of
the late MR. Rush. Any unpleasant feelin , or objection, on his part
to such a statement, might be quelled º Rs. CARTER immediately
striking up, “A man 's a man for a’ that.”
Whether Phrenology is made any clearer or not by MRs. HAMILTON's
musical illustrations of it, we dare say that those illustrations axe
anyhow very well worth hearing.
Fine Feeders.
. It appears that the Sheriffs of London are fined from £500 to £600,
in the guise of a subscription to the LoRD MAYOR's Dinner. Now
this is a tolerable fork-out, for any one who can stand it, even if
destined to the promotion of a high object, but considering what kind
of purpose it is actually squandered on, we must call it a knife-an
fork-out that is quite intolerable.

England, which he seems to identify with that of the Danube, whereon
a handsome check was presented to him by the Turks.

NEGLECTED SCOTLAND.
A Sexsible ScotchMAN writing from
Haddington to the Times,
says that “the real griev-
ances of Scotland are not
her insulted Lions, nor her
deserted Holyrood,” but
lie in “her ill-paved, worse-
lighted and undrained mar-
ket-towns, and in the in-
curable apathy of the inha;
itants to sanitary reform.”
This gentleman says that,
on Tuesday last, at a meet-
ing of the inhabitants of
Haddington, it was, pro-
posed to adopt the drain.
age clauses of the New Po-
| lice Act. After an earnest
and solemn appeal from
their parish minister im-
}. them “to unite with
eart and hand in bringing
the influences of pure air
and water to bear on the
wretched homes of their
rer brethren,” followed
y an awful warning from a
medical officer of the town,
“the householders (many
of them wealthy men)” re-
jected, by a majority of ten
to one, a bill for their as-
sessment, in order to have
their streets and houses
cleansed, at the rate of 10d.
in the pound. .
A week previously, the
Scotch MAN states, the
Haddingtonians had de;
--- - - - voted a day to fasting and
humiliation in the hope that the pºstilence might be averted from them.
Fasting involves self-denial. The Haddington fasters cannot deny themselves
to the amount of 10d in the pound. They cannot fling that tenpence into the
gutter, to sweep it, although the gutter is poisoning their poor neighbours, and
may poison themselves too.
'hristians are supposed to wash their faces when they fast. Whether the
Haddington housekeepers accompany their fasting with any ablution may be
doubted since they refuse to A. 10d, in the pound for washing their town.
By preference, for cheapness sake, they would rather perhaps fast in sackcloth
and ashes; but as all sackcloth is now used up in †. whilst ashes are carted
away for manure, their fasting possibly consists in wearing their usual clothes, and
sitting still in their usual filth, and doing nothing. Whether they abstain from
anything else—from haggis or sheep's head, or collops, or whiskey-toddy—in
addition to abstinence from wholesome exertion—we do not know.
As to the Scotch Lion playing second fiddle in the Royal Arms, he may bless
the sometime DUKE, of ARGYLE and his stars, and be contented to have any
plate, there to fiddle, in at all. By all heraldic right he ought to be ousted altogether,
and his place should be occupied %. more appropriate emblem of a Pig; a
whining, grunting, odoriferous Hog Rampant, sprawling in the filth of towns.
GARE LA GAROTTE.
OUR friend and contemporary the Sunday Times (whose zeal for the spread o'
emºcracy, for the non-suppression of Betting Houses, and for the purification of
the Turf and the Church, we gladly recognise), in commenting upon an excellent
article in which the daily Times dissuades the charitable from encouraging street
mendicancy, has the following startling remarks:–
"While on this, part of the subject, we would suggest the impolicy of withholding from the
metropolitan mendicants, whether impostors or not, the scanty means of support. . . ." we would
counsel the old, ladies and gentlemen not to hold their .#, lest the sturdy vagabond, who now
cºntents himself with extracting pence from their humanity by whining, should’ take to strangling
them in the dark streets, as some members of the fraternity have lately done in Manchester.”
Really, Mr. Punch, who believes that in his time he has done no bad service to
the cause of real Democracy (by which he means a system for the benefit of
the many and not of the few), begs to say that these utterances by the “ Champion
of Democracy,” are more worthy of one of the ruined clients of §. Sunday Times,
the Betting House Keepers (who may now be properly termed vagabonds), than
of a respectable journalist with his faculties in order. Threatening decent people
with strangulation because they decline to assist imposture, is rather a strong
argument. Luckily, there be things called Policemen.

PUNCH AND HIS PIPPINS.
THE “immediate apple of our eye” is an American
apple, which we happen to have in our eye at the present
moment. It is not an apple of discord, but an apple which
comes home to our very heart's core with its assurances
of friendship. A Correspondent, who signs himself “THE
AMERICAN ENThusiast,” has allowed his enthusiasm to
take the very sensible turn of a present of apples to Punch,
who, while receiving it, proceeds to cut it up; and, like
some critics, shows his taste by making minºe-meat of it.
We have perused the whole of the apples with great satis-
faction, and though we might find a spot here and there
the blemish is . on the surface; for, when we descen
a little lower than skin deep, we find the *f; quite

which shall have been merited by a highly useful life,
whereof, the promotion of the cosmopolitan fair in Hyde

In the mean time, that the memorial may be worthy of the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HARD DEALING WITH A HAWKER.
Now, all men, that Falconry is no longer a
British pastime, but Hawking continues to
be practised, though, like Shooting, it is
not lawful, without a license, and in that
case is punishable by a swinging fine. The
Susser and Kent Mail contains a distressing
illustration of this fact; which we subjoin:—
“TUNBRIDGE WELLS. PETTY SESSION,
Nov. 12.
“Before J. DEANE, Esq.
“HAWKING without ALICENsk.—Michael DERLEY
was brought up in custody, charged with selling mats
without a license. The accused did not deny the
charge, but contended that he had a right to do so, as
he manufactured the articles himself. He had done
the same thing in hundreds of towns, and had never
before been interrupted; he had his mother and brother
to support, both of whom were deaf and dumb.
“Mr. DEANE inquired if the prisoner had been
cautioned, and on receiving a reply in the affirmative
(from P. C. Morg AN) intimated that he could not allow the statement of the prisoner
to influence his decision. The tradesmen of the town, as well as persons taking
2nt licenses for hawking, must be protected, and he (the prisoner) must pay a fine of
£10, or go to prison for seven days.
“The prisoner requested MR. DEANE to inform him under what Act he was com-
mitted.
“MR. DEANE declined to give the information.
“The Clerk to the prisoner—You can find that out when you get to gaol.”
Is there any mistake here? Was it for stealing mats that the prisoner
was committed instead of being sent to gaol for selling them ... If not,
does there exist a law so atrocious as to warrant his committal?—if
there is no such law, breathes there such a magistrate as MR. DEANE”

The poor man appears to have had a #. as well as a mother and

punishment...We cannot say, we hope that DERLEY obtained, the in-
formation which ke was so kindly informed that he might seek for in
gaol. If no Act existed to warrant his incarceration, he would have a
legal remedy for what morally, at any rate, was a false imprisonment.
DEBATE ON THE HUDSON QUESTION.
(By slight Anticipation.)
IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT—Monday, 13th February, 1854.
House of LoRDs.
TheIR Lordships met at 5, but rose immediately, in order to afford
various Peers an opportunity of hearing what was going on elsewhere.
IIouse of cowſ Moss.
Petitions having been presented, notices of motion given, and
questions disposed of, - - -
R. Roebuck rose to ...i on the motion which he had placed on
the book. He said he should be very short (A laugh). He could not
express his loathing and contempt for the vulgar and brutal ribaldry
which could find matter for a grin in a man's appearance. He should
be temperate, as all the world knew he always was (Hear, hear), and
should merely read to the House an extract from a document to which
the Hon. Member for Sunderland had sworn, and which that Hon.
Member had º on record in a Court of Justice, in which MR.
HUDsoN—(Order) What was the * of the servile pedantry, that
adhered to rotten forms? (Order.) ell, in which the honourable—
very honourable—right honourable—would that do?—Member swore
that he had expended certain moneys, or used other means, in bribing
and º: members of the legislature to favour railway schemes
in which he was interested. , Conceiving that a legislator who could
ring such a charge against his fellows was utterly unfit to sit among
them, he should—without the least personal feeling—move that Mr.
GroRGE HUDson be expelled the House of Commons (Hear, hear).
MR. HENRY DRUMMOND seconded the motion, but only for the
}. of saying that he perfectly believed every word to which MR.
UDSON had sworn (Hear, hear). He had last session, given Lords
and Commons, aye, and Ministers and Knights of the Garter too, his
opinion of the extent to which º was carried in these days,
and he reiterated his assertions. Still, though offences were to come,
woe to them by whom they came, and therefore he should support
MR. RQEBUCK. . .
The SPEAKER having put the motion,
IORD John Russell, as leader of that House, said that he should
make yery few remarks on a very painful subject. He had carefully
looked into Magna Charta, and also into the Bill of Rights, and was
inclined to believe that neither made any provision for the case of a
railway director who should endeavour to promote steam-traffic by
unlawful means. So far they were in the dark. But it was desirable,
nay, necessary, to consider rather the spirit of the constitution than its
exact letter, and he thought that if the House would refer the matter
to a Select Committee, they might attain their object. The instruction
to that Committee would be to inquire, first, whether steam carriages
were known in the days of KING John, and if not, whether any portion
of a Charta appeared to bear on the case. Next, he thought, the
Committee might inquire whether, at the Revolution, steam travelling
had been invented, and how far the Bill of Rights might have con-
templated wrongful Railway Bills. On receiving the report the House
would determine on its next step. (Hear.) He moved an amendment
in accordance with his suggestion. - -
MR. DiskAELI was the last person to infuse into a question any
element not patently consanguineous with it; but, with all deference
to the noble Lord, he must respectfully inquire whether the noble
Lord's suggestion did not tend to the implicit stultification of the
House. Why, the noble Lord asked the Committee what he had
already told them himself, and did not ask that which it was momentous
to register; namely, whether in the chancery archives a damnatory
record had been deposited. (Hear, hear.
CoLoNEL SIBTHORP said that the noble Lord professed a great deal
of virtue, which was all humbug. Facilis descensus Averni. He believed
all Ministers to be knaves, especially when they most pretended to
decency. Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes. He should leave the House
(laughter); but before he went, he would just say that if the noble
Lord, instead of wallowing in turtle and champagne (laughter), would
introduce wise measures, he should be supported by wise men, himself
amongst the rest. Juder damnatur cum nocens absolvitur.
Mr. G. H. MooRE said that had MR. Hudson been an Irish Member
he would have been expelled long ago, but such was the beastly
bitterness of England towards his, MR. Tſoone's, unhappy countrymen
that, as MR. Hudson usually sat near the Irish Members, he was
allowed to remain there in the hopes that he might contaminate the
high and pure morality which they had learned from their beloved
priests, * which shed a holy and blessed light around their path,
to the utter discomfiture of the bigoted, blatant, and blasphemous
Protestants.
MR. LucAs confirmed MR. MooRE's statement as to the virtues of
the Irish, and the wickedness of the English, and made an animated
attack upon the Church of England, adding an affecting history of the
persecutions to which Catholics were exposed in Protestant countries.
MR. DUFFY, MR. Scully, CAPTAIN MAGAN, and other Irish Members
having diated upon this branch of the subject for about two hours,
LCRD PALMERSTON suggested—he hoped that as-a-a-an, Irish
roprietor, he might be permitted to offer a hint to Irish gentlemen
% and cheers), that they were a little departing from the points
which perhaps offered themselves most prominently; at any rate–a–a
—so it seemed to him. (Hear.) Perhaps it might be advantageous
on the present occasion to -a-a-sink the Pope. . (Great uproar on
the Irish bench.) Of course he meant nothing offensive to His—a-a-
Holiness. (Laughter.) Honourable gentlemen had certainly travelled
very far, but they seemed to have avoided Hudson's Bay. (Shouts of
laughter and cheers.) He thought, really, that as the Hon. Member
for Sunderland was present, he might be asked whether he had
anything to say for himself. English gentlemen were not in the habit
of acting harshly or inconsiderately. (Loud cheers.)
AN IRISH MEMBER (indignantly). “Are Irish?”
LoRD PALMERSTON (laughing). “Qui capit ille facit, you know.”
There were then calls for—
MR. Hupson, who rose, and said, “My position is noways pleasant
and I shall not intrude long upon the ouse. In the §: place
never said, exactually, that I had bribed members of the legislature,
but only that I º applied shares in a way calculated to promote
the interests of a certain company. What I’ve said, I’ve sworn
to ; and what I’ve sworn to, I stick to, of course. I don’t see
anything to be ashamed of in what I have done; but people differ on
these points, and every man has a right to his own opinion. The
ouse can do as it likes. But one thing I do mean to say, and that is,
that if the ouse has a bad opinion of me, lºve a precious bad opinion
of a good many people in the ouse, and out of it too. What was I?
A provincial º who was lucky enough to make a deal of
money., Very well. id I court Dukes, and Markisses, and M.P.'s
and orſicers in the Guards, and dowagers, and debbytarntes, and aii
that * Not I. They courted me. They came to my ouse, and ate
my dinners, and flattered my family, because I’d got a load of money,
no matter how ; and because some of 'em thought they’d get a slice,
the others wanted me to put 'em º to dodges to get money for them-
selves. Same in this ouse. I couldn't come in here, when I was rich,
as the right hon. gentleman in the cheer has seen and knows, but a
mob of young aristocrats, aye and old ones too, all gathered round my
white waistcoat, and were all fawning, and affable, and jocose like.
Now, see how they keep away; and if I run against them, some cut
me, some only nod. Is it because I’m worse than I was P. No, only
because I’m worse off. My golden sunshine brought out the vermin,

and now that’s gone they’re gone too. You may expel me, but you
can’t make me forget, when I had my big ouse, which the French
have taken, how Lords, and Barnets, and Guardsmen, and the Hort
No Bless, and their females crawled and cringed and fawned to the
rich Yorkshire linendraper. And if I git º: as I don’t doubt to do,
I shall have 'em round me again. Money does the trick in England,
and it’s despicable cant to say it don’t. I am in the ands of the ouse.”
The Hon. Member's address caused considerable sensation, especially
among certain strangers in the privileged galleries. MR. HENRY
DRUMMOND was observed to rub his hands with much enjoyment.
LoRD John Russell’s amendment was negatived without a division,
MR. Roebuck's motion was then º and, on the motion of
Mr. Wilson, a new writ was ordered for Sunderland, vacant by the
expulsion of Mr. George Hupson. -
THE FASHIONABLE ZOOLOGICAL STAR.
WE are sorry to see that the Zoological Gardens have lately got
into the “Star system.” Not content with a good working company
of bears and monkeys, they must have particular “Stars” to bring the
million in. Some time ago it was a hippopotamus, who made all
London run after him. Then there was the baby elephant, who was
a source of great interest to mothers. After them followed a chim-
º and a serpent-charmer, and a whole forest-full of humming- ||
irds, and we cannot recollect what else. All of them, however, were
reat attractions in their way; in fact, it may be said that the animals
ately have completely taken the shine out of the actors. As the
theatres have gradually become more empty, the Zoological Gardens
have perceptibly become more crowded. What actor, recently, has
had anything iſe the success that for a whole season ran panting
pushing and squeezing after the Hippopotamus? It was a fight ºf
parasols to get near him—it was a joy greater than that of a new go
to have seen him! What is the reason of this strange preference?
it because the public prefer Nature to Art?—or is it because the
actors speak, and the animals do not?
However, the “Star system” is not likely to be so ruinous here as
at most places of entertainment. We need not say that the Zoological
Stars receive no salaries, beyond their board and lodging; and they
are not likely to ruin their managers with salaries like those. They
are paid regularly every day at the usual feeding hour, and we have
not heard of an instance of any animal, no matter how popular he may
have been, having struck for more beans, or refusing to make his
appearance unless he had a double allowance of paunches.
he latest “Star” at this establishment is the Giant Ant-Eater—that
is to say, if you can call him a Star at all, for, with a tail like his, he is
much more like a comet. It is indeed a tail!—so long is it, that you
imagine it must have been originally published in four-and-twenty
numbers, and that they are here all bound up together. ... And a pretty
thick volume it makes too!" Daniel O'Consei’s “tail” must have
been a wisp of straw compared to it. It hangs like a small willow
tree—only instead of being green, it is a dark badger colour, and, in
texture, resembles some of the long brushes we have seen made of
Indian grass. It is as flexible as a party-politician, for it can be turned
at will to any side. What is the use of such a tail it would be difficult
to say, though as far as that goes, you might as well ask what was the
use of a lady's bonnet, for the one is not worn more at the back than
the other. When the Ant-Eater lies down to sleep, he throws, this
voluminous tail, like a Scotch plaid, round him, and we have no doubt
it keeps him very warm. So, you see, it is of some use after all; and,
for what we know, as he comes from a very warm climate, the Ant-
Eater may use his tail in the summer to fan himself with. We are told
that he is met with in the plains ºf the Brazils; but, from his habit of
spreading his thick hedge of a tail all over his body, we should say that
he was much oftener found in the Bush. In fact, it is a complete furs-
bush-extending out nearly to the same length as his body. He is a
curious animal, take him altogether. In shape he reminds you some-
what of a German pig, which is not the most elegant object a person
can meet with on a long day's journey; only a German pig would be
an English greyhound in symmetry by the side of him. The Ant-Eater
is as hairy as a goat, and all along the ridge ºf his neck he carries a
long frill of hair that stands upright, short and thick, like a long plate-
brush turned upside down. Then the hair falls, down his front legs,
taking the form of a pair of black top-boots. These front legs look at
first like hoofs, for the nails, the length of which any woman of spirit
would envy, are turned underneath, and the noise he makes in walking
upon them sounds exactly as if he had got clogs on. His snout, also,
is extremely peculiar, being admirably adapted, from its length and
narrowness, for getting the marrow out of a marrow-bone. It is longer
than any cucumber reared by a penny-a-liner, only gradually tapering
towards the end, in which is enclosed the tongue, to which it seems to
act as a sort of case.
This case is made of bone; and, really, when the tongue issues
from it; it looks like some very fine surgical instrument that had shot
out of its case upon a spring being touched. We hardly know what to

compare the snout to, unless it is a very long and thin strawberry
pottle, that some wicked boys have been tying over his mouth. This
strawberry pottle is his only feature, for his eyes are so small that they
are rather eyelet holes than eyes; but then, in its great bounty it more
than balances, and leaves a large surplus over, for the miserable
verty of his other features. We know of no other animal that could
i. so easily led by the nose. As for his coat, the hair on it takes
various colours. You remark a long stripe of red running by the side
of a long stripe of black or yellow. The colours, on his breast par-
ticularly, are as distinct, and the lines as sharply, marked, as the
different-coloured grains you see arranged in a seedsman's window.
The poor animal looks remarkably stupid, but happy. He wanders
about his e in a very inquiring manner, looking for his, blessed
ants, whom he cannot find anywhere, and making with his claws the
oise of a French peasant walking in wºoden shoes. He leads a very

ere his accomplishments seem to begin and end; for he does not
sing, nor bray, nor bark, nor low, mor, whistle, nor make any noise
whatever, except the one with his toe-nails, which must be particularly
disagreeable during the night to the i. impanzee who lives in the
next gage to him. We tried very hard to dive §§§ Ant-Eater's
thoughts; but, with all our diving, could not bring up any satisfactory
roof whether the beast was aware of the great popularity he had

employed in rapping have always been in tumblers of one kind or another.
We have frequently suspected Satanic agency in some portions of our

. The Clerical Table Turners seem to imagine that the Satanic agency
is confined to a particular kind of furniture, but our own opinion is,
that we are just as likely to find the “old gentleman” in the chair as
in any other portion of our moveables. We do not see why the presence
of the evil one should be confined to the work of the cabinet-maker or
the carpenter, and indeed there are several articles of hardware which

SURE SYMPTOM'S OF CHRISTMAS.
(By a Surly Old Bachelor.)
UNCH,-I know Christmas is coming
from certain well-known symptoms
that never fail to present themselves
at this time of the year:—
Because my landlady is so ex-
tremely civil to me, and brings me
my shaving-water the moment I
ring for it.
plain for two weeks about my boots,
and the coal-scuttle is generally
pretty full of coals.
Because the breakfast is laid be-
fore I am up, and when I ask for
toast with my tea in the evening,
º kitchen fire has not once been
Oulu.
Because the impudent news-boy
has been much earlier with the news-
paper than usual.
- Because, wherever I have called,
I haven't had cold meat for dinner
for ever so long—for two weeks at
least.
Because I cannot get my bills in
from my tradesmen—they smile,
and scrape their feet in their vile
saw-dust, and murmur something about, “any time will do, Sir,” and
present me with French plum and bonbon-boxes, and fancy I have
nothing better to do than to lay in a plantation of Čhristmas trees. -
Because the crossing-sweeper takes his hat off to me every time
I pass.
Hºuse the Beadle has been wonderfully profuse with his cocked
hat, and the pew-opener, within the last fortnight, has nearly curtseyed
me to death.
Because, wherever I have called, I have found, all the servants
smiling most unnaturally, and bringing me things I didn't want.
* my little nephews have been so very affectionate to me
tely.
fºue my little nieces have run up to me, and kissed me in a way
that was more flattering than agreeable, and i have had º #. Coat
and hat and umbrella and goloshes miled off me before ave had
time to inquire whether my brother (he is only a clerk) was at home.
Because I have been bothered out of my life with so many inquiries
about that “distressing cough’’ of mine, and have been recommended
so many wonderful remedies that were sure to cure it, which remedies,
if I }.} only taken one half of them, I shouldn't be alive at the present
moment.
Because the Waits wake me up at night, paying me the discordant
compliment of playing opposite my window longer than anybody else's.
And because—but I think I have said enough of these symptoms,
which luckily “come but once a year.” After all, I don't know-
perhaps they are not so disagreeable, for the attentions one receives at
this period are as flattering to one's vanity as they are conducive to
one's comfort. The worst is, one knows they all spring out of a
Christmas Box—and these boxes, as I have learnt to my cost, are not
to be had so cheaply as bandboxes. The enjoyment would be all the
more enjoyable, if one hadn't to pay so, dearly for it. During the
hristmas month, my, outgoings invariably exceed, my incomings;–
otherwise, I like it well enough, and shouldn't, mind if the whole year
were composed of nothing but Christmas months.

OUR BOTTLE-HOLDER.
So, PALMERSTON's out! and the cannie Scotch Peer
Whom he cuts, is in haste to be first with the story,
And, to poison our PAM in the popular ear,
Proclaims that for years our § friend’s been a Tory.
But Punch is afraid that another Scotch mull
Is marking the course of the friend of ST. Nicholas;
For the good MR. BULL is by no means so
As not to perceive that the charge is ridiculous.
What! PALMERSTON, Liberty's champion in need,
Who confronted oppressors with England's broad a gis,
And haughtily ordered the despots to read
On its blazon, the duties that Lords owe to Lieges
Who has fluttered, not º (like us, dear Lord A.,
Who all “ §. lack ” to sustain us)

Whose name gives the sign for a chorus of groans,
Where, crowned and anointed things gibber in ermine,
And, where slaves crawl and slaver the É. of thrones, .
Sends them off to their holes, as the light does night vermin.
But Eagles

It really won't do. To your patron, the CzAR,
...When the now.forming file of the newspapers comes, he
Will laugh out in scorn with a royal “Ha! haſ
To think ABERDEEN was so helplessly clumsy.”
So, call him what you, for about forty years,
here—a Tory—or aught that comes into your noddle,
One only regrets that in these days one hears
Of sovery few Tories who're built on his model.
He remembers the service by PALMERSTON done
Since he took the portfolio, but yesterday hawked about ;
How, shoulder to wheel, he went through at a run
The work that all others had dawdled and talked about.
The grind for “six moons ° to the wife-beating brute;
The foot on the dens where turf-gamblers would cozen;
The foul furnace throats made to swallow their soot;
The yet fouler charnel yards closed by the dozen.
The lecture your Lordship's Scotch friends would not print,
Who against Sabbath-breaking so tipsily hiccup;
And the scourge he was knotting, by way of a hint
To bid ruflians reflect before taking the stick up.
All this, my dear Lord, in our tablet’s enrolled;
And we’d yº respectfully say to your Lordship,
That the tales of your organs had better be told
To those worthies, the resident soldiers on board ship.

THE REASON OF PRISON EXPENDITURE.
THE following paragraph occurs in the Preston
Guardian:-
“The Cost of Cante-The REveREND Mr. CLAY, the Chaplain
of the Preston House of Correction, estimates the loss caused to
the public by fifteen pickpockets, whose careers he has traced,
including the value of the property stolen, expenses of prosecution,
and maintenance in gaol, at £26,500."
How many schoolmasters might have been had for
the money which fifteen pickpockets have cost the
nation?– and how many more than fifteen boys might
those schoolmasters have prevented from becoming
pickpockets?—and how much * a sum than £26,500
º have thereby been saved
Why cannot this great saving of money—to say
nothing of vice and misery—be effected? ...

We have been told that “necessity has no law; ” but it would seem
that the law is reduced to the last stage of necessity, or it would never
offer such º terms as those specified above to the very meanest
of its myrmidons. “Thirteen shillings a week” is about one-third
of the pay of a journeyman carpenter, and less than a third of what
may be earned by many of those who are out “on strike” for higher

it seems, understand “abstracting;” but we should fear that he might
try his abilities in endeavouring to “abstract” something from the

out of their unfortunate clerks, and i blood can be got out of a stone,

“A STATUE to ALBERT,” said CHALLIs enchanted,

The thought was conceived, and he now only wanted
The ear of the public to it to incline.
He wrote a few letters to people to bore them,
And ask them to second his fawning intent;
But, so coldly the public appeared to ignore them,
That he saw they too plainly perceived what he meant.

AGRICULTURAL BRUISERS.
THRASHING, bruising and milling are now carried to such
rfection by machinery that every housekeeper may thrash
is own establishment, every father of a family may do his
own bruising, and every man may have the luxury of a private
mill on his own premises. At the recent Cattle Show, our
attention was invited to a “compact hand mill,” calculated to
do an immense amount of bruising, and to give a regular
#. dressing at the same time to a certain quantity of flour.
he newspapers are continually asking us whether we bruise
our oats, and intimating that if we vigorously assault our
corn it will serve us as well again, from which we infer that
every blow administered to our oats will be the means of
an extra blow-out to our cattle. We wish our agricultural
friends would tell us whether the bruising system would be
º to anything else beside corn, and whether we may

A NoMPE GUERRE.-The French papers talk of ABERDEEN,
A PLAN FOR THE SIMPLIFICATION OF
PUBLIC ORATORY.
MR., PUNCH, who has suffered so much from the inordinate long-
windedness of our public orators in general, and of our senators in
#. that he can thoroughly appreciate the misery which it must
ve inflicted upon the nation, has, | his own free motion and consent
meditated and devised a scheme, by which the nation will be released
from the pain of hearing, and our public men from the labour of
uttering speeches; whilst the former will still have the conviction that
its representatives are taking pains to express its sentiments, and the
latter will still have their vanity gratified by the belief that they are
ing a sensation. Mr. Punch has read in the works of MEssRs.
Huc and GABET (two missionaries, in whom the humour of RABELAIs
is combined with the kindly ſervour of LAs CASAs) that the Lamas in
Thibet—who have more prayers to recite than they can get through in
a day, without suspending their ordinary avocations—are in the habit of
employing what they call. Tchu Kor, or turning prayers. These are
large but light cylinders of wood, placed on an axle, and inscribed with
a great number of prayers in Thibetian characters. The devout Lama
gives the Tchu Kor a push, which sets it in motion for a considerable
period, during which he goes about his secular business, and leaves
the performance of his religious exercises to this pious whirligig.
Mr. Punch were acquainted with the Lamas, he .# suggest
to them that by the help of a little simple machinery and the aid of a
turnspit dog, they might prolong their prayers #. a period quite
beyond the strength of their own ingenious but imperfect instrument.
But as it is, he contents himself with recommending that Tchu Kor,
or ...; cylinders, shall be introduced into the House of Commons
without delay. So many of the speeches made in that º have
no sort of interest, for it or for the public, and are dictated only by the
desire of the Members to acquit themselves of a duty to their consti-
tuents, that they might as well not be uttered at all. And as no
speech is supposed to influence a division, or gain over a vote, whilst
many give rise to much bad blood, and to endless misunderstandings,
Wol. xxv. C
preyarications, rejoinders, and recriminations, it would be as well that
so fertile a source of mischief should at once be dried up; and that if
Members must talk, they should do so only through the medium of
the Tchu Kor. - - - -
Each Member might have his peculiar cylinder, surmounted by a
bust of himself, and carved from that tree, whose properties were most
in accordance with the characteristics of his oratory or his politics,
Thus the cylinders of LoRD BROUGHAM, and MR. DisrAEII, that
ungent couple, might be carved from the prickly pear; those of
W. NEwdEGATE and MR. HENLEY from the sloe; that of MR. HuME,
the Senior of the House, from the elder; that of SIR. RobºFT INGLIS,
from the cherry, as he is the Bob cheri of the high Tories; that
of MR. BRIGHT, from the aspen; that of MR. BROTHERTON, the
Vegetarian, from a large turnip; that of MR. LUCAs, from the bramble;
that of MR. CoBDEN, from the (good) service tree; and that of LoRD
PAIMERSTON, the universal favourite, from the poplar. (Oh!)
The members might attend to turn their own cylinders, or the
“Turner of the House of Commons” (for the duties of the Speaker
would be at an end) might go round and set in motion the cylinders of
those whose opinions i. wished to, circulate. The Irish members
might be gratified, yet without any hindrance to public business, by
the simultaneous gyrations of all their cylinders; a number of others,
inscribed with the words Hear! Hear! or Question! might always
be kept going; and if any honourable gentlemen, chose to inscribe on
their Tchu Kor words descriptive of cock-crowing, or braying, they
might make fowls or donkeys of themselves without hurting the
feelings of others. In short Mr. Punch is so interested in his scheme,
and so anxious for its development, that, he pledges himself to have
Toby in readiness to turn, LöRD, John Russell's Tchu Kor, on the
very first night that the scheme shall come into operation

FACTS FOR, COCKNEY NATURALISTS.
SETTERs are a kind of dog kept exclusively in poultry-yards, for the
purpose of assisting the hens in the work of incubation.
ere are curious couples to be met with in the natural as well as
in the social world...Thus Rooks and Pigeons are almost always found
in company; while the Oyster but rarely appears without a Swallow.
The habits of the London rabbit (specimens of which may be ob-
tained at anyº are extremely curious, and interesting to the
maturalist. ough wild at times, it is easily domesticated, and will
eat from the hand as well as from the pie-dish. It frequents in the
day-time the tops of water-tubs and the bottoms of areas; while at
night it is generally found on the tiles. When pleased, the animal
makes a soft purring noise; but at . its cries are loud and piercing,
and seriously disturb the neighbourhood which it infests. #. ears
partake rather of the “crop” order than the “lop,” and unlike the
country species, it has a long tail. Unlike that species also, it is said,
in lodgings especially, to be omnivorous.
Salmon of large size may be caught pretty freely in the Serpentine
nearly all the year round—with a hook.
The author of “Nasology” asserts that human, beings are distin-
guished chiefly by the nose; and the remark may be extended to the
inferior creation, for there is scarcely a creature but has some promi-
ment feature for the naturalist to lay hold of Thus you may always
know a woodcock, like an inn-keeper, by the length of his bill, while a
woodpecker more nearly resembles an apothecary, from its keepi
bark continually on tap. In the same way, too, cocks are hiºi
by their combs, and foxes by their brushes.
It is a singular fact that country cats have generally not half the
appetite of London ones. The voracity of these, latter animals is
indeed prodigious; and hardly less surprising is the variety of their
diet. e have ourselves repeatedly known instances, where in a single
night the cat has been discovered to have eaten about a potund of beef-
steak, and more than three quarters of a leg of mutton; and we are
informed by a scientific friend of ours, who lives in lodgings, that he
has even met with cases well authenticated by his landlady, where in
less than a week her cat has consumed half a caddy of his tea, as well
as an entire bottle of his brandy. ;

CENTRALIZATION IN THE CITY.
WHATEveR may be the nature of the thinking principle of man, there
is no doubt that the soul of business, Punctuality, is material. This
psychological truth has been judiciously recognised in the practical
philosophy of the City of London, which has devised a method of
insuring the virtue in question, based on a profound conviction of its
materiality. Qf Committees for General Purposes, MR. THOMAs
Rogers, in evidence before the Corporation Commission, stated that
“In order to induce Members to attend punctually the Chairman waits five minutes.
At the expiration of that time he drops his hammer, and then all who are present have
a right to dine with the Committee, but all who come after the five minutes are excluded
from the dinner.”
No doubt the attendance is generally full—at the commencement of
the proceedings as well as after the subsequent repast. But in case
the majority of the members are behind time, do the minority eat up
the dinner provided for the whole number P. Should the persons present
at the fall of the hammer amount to just thirteen, does the popular
superstition, that objects to a baker's dozen at the mahogany, prevent
them from sitting down to table in a party of that number? If so
does one gentleman retire, or is one more taken in from the exclud
set, and is the fortunate, or unfortunate, individual selected by lot?
These are questions that suggest themselves to most thinking minds,
tºº, they did not occur to those of the Commissioners.
“Domine Dirige Nos’ ought no longer to be the civic motto. Con-
sidering their characteristic principle of managing matters by appealing
to the centre of the human system, the stomach, a better motto for the
Corporation would be “Medio tutissimus ibis.”

and, in proof of his regard for a
class whom he firmly believes not to
be much blacker than they are
painted, he subjoins a specimen of
º attorney's bill. Mr. Punch
ers it to the profession as a
thodel, and is convinced that if bills
of costs were framed on its prin-
ciple, he should hear less of strikes
in the higher Courts—that whole-

is abated, and the roll lightened.

If the energetic Home Secretary had only mentioned to us—confi-

use a pen-every goose, in fact, possessed of a quill—to write to him
on the subject of any and every grievance, we should have dissuaded
him from the too adventurous act. The daily, and indeed hourly
contents of our letter-box would, iſ set before his Lordship, have
convinced him, that the corrector of public abuses will find himself
continually buried under a Mont Blanc of foolscap, and enveloped in a
mist of envelopes. LoRD PALMERStoN will have less labour thrown

CURIOSITIES OF THE CATTLE SHOW.
The annual, aggregation of “fatty deposits,” at the Bazaar in
Baker Street, has just taken place, as usual. It is, perhaps, as well
that the exhibition should be of brief duration; for, in these days of
“nuisance removal,” we are not sure that the overfed beasts might
not have been regarded as so many accumulations of offensive matter,
and ordered to be got rid of accordingly.
. The yearly gathering of agriculturists is
circulation of all sorts of puffing hand bill
of some new inventions for puzzling the weak agricultural mind, and
making a demand on the cultural pocket. We fancy we sce a
little turn for irony in one of the announcements put into our hand,
which invited our “particular attention” to an article called the
“Farmer's Friend,” which has proved “an efficacious cure of fret and
cholic.” If the farmers have not yet left off fretting, here is a friend
indeed; and it is to be had as low as 1s., 8d. a bottle. We should
suspect that the proposed antidote to “fret and cholic” among the
farmers would be found, if analysed, to contain a good share of
alcohol. Among the “drinks for cattle’’ advertised at the Bazaar, we
find one of a rather startling description, which is recommended “for
the disease called Hoven Blown Blasted Fog sickness”—a malady
which we hope neither man nor beast is likely to be afflicted with.

WE cultivate sacred music; but until recently, from a remote period
of antiquity, we have had no sacred dancing. A gentleman, however,
has just brought out an “Evangeline Waltz,” which he advertises in
conjunction with a “Flirtation Polka”. The gentleman probably con
ceives himself to have a “mission” to diffuse the Evangel of CUFID by
the instrumentality of capers.

SHAME I
THE HERO OF A HUNDRED HURDLES.
Two gallant officers, a Lieutenant and a Captain of the Fusileers,
have lately been running a flat race and a hurdle race against each
other. The amusement was manly . and quite unobjectionable;
though there is something at the first glance rather odd in the idea o
two British officers ºf which can run the fastest, when we
recollect that never to run is the usual practice of our soldiers. We
are quite sure that the competitors on this occasion will never use
their running powers in the field of action, except in pursuit of an
enemy. The races were well contested; the flat, race being won
by the Lieutenant, who “beat his opponent by three feet,” which
seems rather unfair, as no man ought to be allowed more than two feet
to compete in a running match. In the hurdle race, the Lieutenant
commenced well against the Captain, but was unable to run him
through—having unfortunately slipped in taking the fifth hurdle....The
incident is suggestive of º: parody on the favourite military
song of “March : March!”
Jump, jump! Captain and Subaltern, -
Wº; my lads, do you not tighten your girdles?
Jump, jump! make a fair start of it;
There goes the Subaltern over the hurdles!
Comrades shall many a day tell of the horrid way-
(E'en the bare thought makes the life-blood to curdle)
How the poor Subaltern—as his luck took a turn—
Pitched on his head ere he reached the fifth hurdle.
Jump, jump, &c. &c.
The Best Way of Making Way is to Take it.
SoME persons have such a taking way with them that “if you give

had this same grasping manner about them, and if the Turks had
#. ºn a single inch, by this time they would have taken the
atolan-elles.
The GREAT REFoRMER of The AGE-To-morrow.
THE PRINCE, THE PIGS, AND THE PARASITES.
... WE think we have at last found a key to the flunkeyism of those
citizens who are desirous of ##. º an ALBERT Testimonial. The
recurrence of the Smithfield Club Cattle Show has presented the
Prince Consort again, before us, in the character of a prizeholder by
virtue of a wonderful pen of pigs, which proves His Royal High-
ness's continued devotion to porcine development. We all łoś. the
effect of a fellow feeling, and we are satisfied that the “greasy citi:
zens” must entertain a natural sympathy with those precious feats of
princely care which excite so much admiration in Baker Street. The
Aldermanic mind would easily find an excuse for gratitude, in the fact
that, PRINCE ALBERT seeks to give importance to the pig; and they
would infer that he who would aggrandise the ordinary pig would not
desire to make little of the London Alderman. For our own parts,
without wishing to draw a nice distinction, we can appreciate the
views of His Royal Highness, and though he may continue to fatten
pigs for many years to come, we should not attribute to him any desire
to see the London Corporation fattening on the spoils it has so long

IN the course of a speech delivered the other day at Southampton,
the Bishop of OxFord is reported to have remarked that
“There should be Bishops over the Clergy who would weep when they wept, and
rejoice when they were glad."
Under existing circumstances that would be a difficult arrangement.
What with poor curates weeping on their £70 or £80 annual pittances,
and rich pluralists rejoicing at the same time in their several thousands
a year, a Bishop, in order to sympathize with both, would have to weep
with one side of his face and smile with the other.

THE TROUSER MIND.
HIS kind of mind struts
about infanciful costumes,
It flaunts in vagaries, an
is always masquerading
its betters. It is a min
of colours, but colours
without any union, or har-
monious combination—
giving one the notion of
an Irish rainbow, in which
all the hues had quar-
relled, and resolved to live
apart. Nothing is too
broad for it, like a Palais
Royal farce. Its legs are
scored like a leg of pork
—only the scoring is fear-
ful in length, so that
nothing can wipe it out,
like the debts a young
man runs up at college.
It is lined all over like a
zebra, and as the zebra is
the animal that is next
to the donkey, the descrip-
tion may be said to fit it
like a second skin. There
is about such a mind the emptiness of vanity coupled with all its noise
—not unlike the noise, which coppers, make when they jingle in an
empty pocket. ºl. about it is brassy and loud-in fact, it is a
perfect ophicleide o j. that is always in full blow. It gives
you, the headache to look at the owner of such a mind. Better
to be right in the middle of the orchestra than sit next to such
a mind at the theatre; the one is the soft murmur of Midsummer
silence compared to the Cochin China cock-crowing of the other.
It never, whispers, but, bawls, like the waiter at a cook-shop.
The mind bellows, like the poor fellows outside Richardson's show
—and the greater the bellowing the poorer, the entertainment, gene:
rally, within. Its presence is a continual jar—a jar of sour and
9ffensive things, like one of GoLDNER's preserves. How it swaggers!
One would imagine the whole street belonged to it. It cannot
sneeze like other people, but makes ten times more noise than an
sneeze demands. }: coughs to give notice of its arrival at any place—it
bangs the door to give notice of its departure. Its insolence insists upon
the i. of everything—the seat nearest the fire, the best bedroom, the
best cuts at dinner, and the best attention from everybody. It always
takes the wall—it never gives way to anybody, not even to a lady. #
she wants more room, let her go into the mud! It keeps its hat on in
the presence of its superiors; but this is done more from ignorance
than bravado, for it never, suspects for a moment that it has any supe-
riors. It stops contentedly in the middle of the room, arranges its two
locks of japamned hair, that descend like two pitcher-handles on each
side of its stony face; opens its legs, and admires its trousers with an
air of the most supreme satisfaction. The Trouser Mind rarely looks
upward. The head is to it a matter of very secondary importance,
excepting as being a block that carries so much hair. Its thoughts are
1 downward: if a person is introduced to it, the first survey is
always to his boots and trousers, it measures mankind by its ºãº:
garments. The other, half of the body is quite superfluous. In fact,
the human body would, in the opinion of the Trouser Mind, be greatly
improved, if it could be so contrived as to wear two pairs of trousers:
one above and one below—and each P. to be totally different. In
the upper regions, a thunderstorm of a pattern—in the lower, an
earthquake.
A Confounded Bully.
DID Nicholas mean, say, ye schoolmen so clever,
To entreat he might not be confounded for ever;
Or, did he intend, with presumption unbounded,
To prefer a request to be never confounded?
The former º: to have been his petition,
There is hope for him yet in unfeigned contrition;
The latter’s past praying for—merely delusion:
Old Nick has already been put to confusion.
A CITY PROWERB.
(To be imbibed whilst eating Turtle.)
“SPARE the BIRCH (in Cornhill), and you’ll spoil the Alderman.”
The MARCH of INTELLECT-Everybody walking into everybody else!

PROPOSALS FOR A NEW ART OF PUFFING.
It has long been felt that all the old arts of puffing have been
exhausted, and the consequence is that some of the most renowned
masters of the arts formerly in vogue have retired from a field in which
nothing more can be gathered. e poet has departed from the Mart
of Moses, and the Muses that once hung round the brilliant jet of
WArmen have deserted those extensive premises in the Strand where
every blacking-bottle used to be, as it were, a jet of the Fount of Castaly,
The harp that once in WARREN's Mart
The soul of Music shed,
Now mutely lies in WARREN's cart,
Or under WARREN’s bed.
So sleeps the source of Moses' lays,
So RowLANDs' puffs are o'er;
And heads once wreathed in poets' bays
Are thumped for rhymes no more."
No more by stanzas, songs, and odes
WARREN his blacking sells; r
The van alone the carman loads,
The name of WARREN tells.
Thus Moses' muse so seldom wakes;
The only sign she gives
Is when some silly rhymes she makes,
To show that still she lives.
. Poetic puffing having been blown to its utmost extent until the over-
inflated windbag has burst and collapsed, the oratorical style of puffing
having departed with the late lamented GeoRGE Robins, and the
narrative or anecdotical order of puffing having been abandoned by
Row LAND AND SON, of scented memory, nothing remains but to invent
a novelty. Acknowledging, as we do, that “there is nothing new
under the sun,” we sit down on a day when there is no sun to be seen,
and on a misty morning in December we ask ourselves whether some.
thing new under a fog . be perceptible. From the huge cauldron
of pea-soup, which is emblemed in the London atmosphere, we fancy
we discern something, and a new art of puffing is . to us in the
shape of a Proposal to combine the Commercial with the Comic, and
to establish on the ruins of WARREN’s fitful lyre and Moses’ muse's
measures a system of comic puffing, containing a joke in every announce-
ment. In order to show how the thing may be done, we give—gratis
-a few specimens. We will begin with a few jokes for Royal
1st. The QUEEN’s shoemaker may advertise himself as “purveyor
of shoes to the whole of HER MAJESTY's foot,” and he may also add
that “the good footing on which Royalty stands with the people in
this jº entirely due to &c. &c., who makes the QUEEN’s shoes,
and who sells highlows, &c. &c. &c.”.
2nd. The QUEEN’s glover may announce that “the affection enter-
tained by the whole nation for the Royal Kids is entirely due to the
fact that HER MAJESTY buys all her gloves of &c. &c.”
3rd. The QUEEN’s perfumer may ask conundrumically: “Why is
Royalty in such excellent odour in England P Because all the scents
used in the palace are purchased at &c. &c.”
4th. The QUEEN's hairdresser may—with a disregard to orthograph
which is allowable in a perruquier and a punster—hazard the remar
“that the true secret of the grace and beauty which adorn the hair to
the throne is to be found in the fact that HER MAJESTY's hair owes
its attractiveness to the hand of Nature and the pomade sold only
by &c. &c. &c.”
We could multiply instances over and over again. But as our
object is to suggest a new mine of wealth to those literary men of our
day who look to the art of puffing as a mode of obtaining an occasional
blow out, we shall not proceed to forestall them in their labours, an
take out of their mouths one morsel of that bread which, to the utter
consternation of the poet, is now selling at elevenpence the quartern.
An Old Lamp and a New One.
THE scheme of the ARCHBishop of PARIs for instituting a fête
under the name of Fête des Ecoles, to promote learning in connexion
with faith, is a happy one. Everybody will agree in the sentiment
expressed in his pastoral, that “Religion and Science are the two lamps
which enlighten the world.” And if by religion he means Popery, it
may be permitted to congratulate him that, happily for the human race,
one of the lights which he alludes to has put out the other's burning.
ANIMPRovement—The Russian army boasts of a PRINCE STIRBEy.
We think it would be an improvement, and only a just compliment to
the aggressive spirit of the ians, to call him PRINCE DISTURBEY.

252 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI.
PROPHETS IN THE PARLOUR—GYPSIES IN THE
KITCHEN.
HEN SUSAN, maid-of-all-
2 work in the regular and
respectable family of
MR. Potts—small City-
man, with ambition under
his waistcoat to be some
day considerably bigger
—when the aforesaid
illiterate and super-
stitious SUsAN, wishing
to better herself— (a
vanity that is uncon-
sciously shared with her
gypsey from Barnes or
Norwood — EGLANTINE
dealing in husbands of
every variety and at the
shortest notice — and,
giving ear to the pro-
phetic gypsey, gives her
at the same time an
opportunity to draw into
- - - - her Maelstrom pocket or
wallet certain silver spoons, afterwards identified by MR. Potts—his own initials
lovingly intertwining with the initials of MRs. Potts, with the family crest of a
rampant lion licking his tongue at posterity indubitably marking them as his
property—
W. we say, SUSAN weeps and knocks her knees together, in a paroxysm
of terror before the worthy and respected M.R. SixMUNCE—and the indomitable
EGLANTINE looks callously innocent, calling all the stars to witness that “the gal
giv her the spoons as her own goods and nobody's else's—”
When SUSAN is confronted with this alleged fact—the respectable part of societ
of which Mr. and MRs. Potts are such very distinguished members, shakes its head,
and wonders how ignorance at eight pounds a year, tea and sugar included, can
be such a fool as to believe in a § sey J, However, , the benevolent MR,
SixMUNCE commits EGLANTINE to Tothill-Fields, and—with one of those paternal
remonstrances that have won for him the proud designation of the Father of
the Bench—dismisses the grateful SUsAN to her kitchen, MR. and MRs. Potts
with a sudden benevolence, which causcs them some, after astonishment and
tºngulation on their goodness, consenting to give the creature another
Thal.
Now at the very time that SUSAN was opening her homely hand, that gypsey
EGLANTINE might read in its hard page the marriage lines §the hopeful maiden
(who is to give sixpence at most for the glad tidings; the spoons being purely
an after-thought of the gypsey’s own)—at the very time MRs. Potts in her parlour
is reading Raphael's Prophetic Messenger; for the which she-the educated,
finished MRs. Potts; for was she not beautifully finished at Athens House,
Wandsworth P-for the which she has, in the best faith and best current silver,
disbursed two-and-sixpence Ignorance, crieth out in the streets, and everybody
gives ear to her. Our Messenger has, to be sure, a more winning introduction than
even the smiles and musical cajolery of EGLANTINE PRIGDuck. For it has a
beautiful picture in which the events of 1854 are brought out in bold red, and
lue, and orange-tawney. Louis NAPOLEoN is engaged chatting with BRITANNIA
-(who is a king him to run across and take a cup of tea in London, the British
Lion at her side manifesting no objection whatever)—the while a very hairy Savage
has a dagger upraised at the EMPEROR's back, and is evidently screwing himself up
to “the sticking place.” There are mourning-coaches going to “take up" at
Windsor Castle, with other graphic amenities significant of what must happen in
the year 1854, ...And for this the enlightened MRs. Potts (that gypsey is still with
SUsAN in the kitchen) has given two-and-sixpence; and that too with the mighty
resolution of getting her good half-crown's worth out of it. Well, MRs. Potts
begins with January, turning very pale as she learns this fact :—
Rº",
~
“The square of VENUs and SATURN denotes severe affliction to a lady of the highest rank. The
q 9.
tranquillity of France is di-turbed; much excitement reigns in Paris, Lyons, Toulouse, and Rome.
Turkey and the regions of the Tigris and Euphrates are sorely afflicted.”
This lady—whoever she may be—has very sore afflictions throughout the
twelvemonth; but then RAPHAEL must earn his half-crown's worth.
In February, MRs. Potts is informed—(and thinks, with a shiver of little
WILHELMINA who has not yet had the scarlet fever)—in February:
“Mans retrogrades to the opposition of the Moon in the radix of the PRINcess Alice, and indicates a
liability to ſeverish complaint or accident."
MRI. Potts has conjugal fears for the health of Potts, and resolves to insist upon
gutta percha soles. In March—
*The retrogradation of Mans in Wingo in opposition to Venus, also retrogade in Pisces, will
even by MR. and MRs.
Potts themselves) —
gives ready ear to
3GLANTINE PRIgbuck,
stir up civil broils in Portugal; treachery and conspiracies amongst
the priesthood are directed against the QUEEN and Government of that
country.”
Already, the poor QUEEN of PoETUGAL sleeps in the
tomb of the BRAGANZAs; but even RAPHAEL cannot be
always infallible; not even for half-a-crown!.
April is big, with events; or rather with one event
that must swallow up every other. MRs. Potts is a play-
goer, and with the sensibility of her sex, would “ten to
one rather see the Corsican Brothers than Hamlet.”
Therefore she reads the subjoined with corresponding
perturbation.
“Scandal or death awaits one renowned in the theatrical world."
This is in April 1 Perhaps on the first of April? It
cannot be BARRY, the deathless Clown, who shall be
snatched from us? If, then, it should be the the the
“renowned"—but no we will not, we cannot think of
it ! Ha! haſ haſ Sardanapalus is himself againi
MAY is full of danger as of hawthorn. What can the
loyal MRs. Potts think of this?
“MARs hastens, as it were, to apply the torch to the train of evil he
has previously laid. The highest power in the land is grievously afflicted.
It is the earnest prayer of RAPHARL, that the direful influence of
Satun N on the ascending degree and radical place of the luminaries
in our beloved Sovereign's horoscope may be averted."
But this is nothing. “The highest power” is continually
threatened; a prediction that, in the days of QUEEN Bess,
would—we doubt not—have helped RAPHAELto the .
ibbet. Again RAPHAEL turns the penny upon “our beloved
Sovereign.” In June, he says–
“I DARE Not fully enter into All the important significations of these
positions and configurations. I sincerely pray that the health of our
beloved Sovereign may be preserved, in which I am assured her subjects
will universally join.”
(Do we not behold RAPHAEL, on his bended knees
“sincerely praying,” with the half-crown in his mouth ;
In July, however, our prophet makes merchandize of the
QUEEN’s children.
“Saturn transits the place of the Sun in the nativity of the
PRINCEss HELENA, producing a tendency to disease in the chest, &c., at
the end of June and begiºning of July. The 7th and 8th are evil days
for the PRINCE or Walks, and the 19th for the Pauxck ARTHUR.
Their attendants should carefully avoid accident.”
These would have made, very “evil days.” for our
prophet; evil as pillory and cart-whip could have shaped
them. But we live in liberal times, and the Astrologer
may turn his half-crown upon the probable diseased chest
of the little PRINCEss HELENA, and the threatened dangers
of PRINCEs ALBERT and ARTHUR
MRs. Potts reads in August that “the King of NAPLEs
should beware of female intrigue, poison, or the assassin; ”
and-controlling her emotion—turns over to September,
where she learns among other not impossible events that
“great cruelty is displayed towards some female about the
27th.” MRs. Potts thinks October a little slow. “Public
writers and scientific men are unsuccessful:” and what of
that? “The fine arts prosper!” Bother the fine arts:
and straightway MRs. Potts passes to November, when
“Much excitement reigns throughout the land; the long talked of
invading army may, under these influences, make its appearance, and
ere many months ‘the wolf will come.’”
With the intuitive calculation of woman, MRs. Potts
wonders where on earth she and Potts are to sleep, if the
Russians—which, of course, is meant by the wolf—is
quartered upon 'em P
But this is nothing to what is threatened in December.
MRs. Potts continues to read with—very naturally—-
increasing fear and amaz, ment. Fear for HER MAJESTY
the QUEEN, and amazement at things in generall “Heaven
preserve!”—crics the prophet in ominous tones—“Heaven
preserve the health of our Sovereign, and also of her
people !”-ending with the new version of a Dead March,
set after this fashion:-
“Dark and gloomy clouds hover over us; and I regret to add that
during the year 1855 the significations are still fearfully evil. I car not
at present discover one ray of hope.”
What? Not for half-a-crown?
make it three-and-sixpence
Now, whilst the PottsEs continue to read the Prophetic

would be the terrible suspicion I cannot divest myself of that every

devoirs to—and those only in secret—is OLD ToM; and that it is as

was the goddess who first gave her countenance to Gin?. PALLAs, to
be sure; and her very origin was the result of a drunken frolic, for are
we not told that she came into the world during one of Jove's
splitting headaches: Now PALLAs is the confessed patroness of all
lue-Stockings; and as a public-house is to this day called, in honour
of her, a “Gin Pallas.” it is not very unreasonable to suppose that her
protégées are addicted to the same terrible practice It is sad, indeed,
to think—and I only hope it is not true—that the Tree of Knowledge
should, with elderly ladies, be a Juniper Tree.”-Anon.
PHRENOLOGICAL ORGAN MUSIC.
Concerts are tole-
rably good; those
of the Sacred Har-
monic Society are
pretty fair, but
there is a musical
entertainment now
going on, which,
if it realises the
object it aims at,
must beat every
other quite out of
the field. A lady,
MRs. HAMILTON,
under the title of
“Practical Phreno-
logist,” professes,
by advertisement,
5 to . give public
| performances, de-
scribed by her as
* “Phrenology illus-
trated by Music.”
The shallow punster will of course remark that he imagined that the
only organs susceptible of musical expression were those of the
sort invented by St. CECILIA, and not such as were discovered by
Gail and Spurzhenſ; except that the phrenological organ of tune
might, perhaps, sing for itself. However, HANDEL may be considered
to have illustrated the organ of Veneration in his Oratorios; WEBER
that of Marvellousness in his Der Freischütz and Oberon; BEETHoven
that of Ideality and the organs of the other sentiments proper to man,
in combination with those of the reflective faculties, in his symphonies
and sonatas; BELLINI and Donizettſ the organs of Adhesiveness and
Amativeness. RossINI might also be adduced as an illustrator of
Gaiety or Mirthfulness, and Imitation, ºr the dramatic, organ, But
Mrs. Hamilton's music, which is to illustrate Phrenology at large,

and consequently all the organs, must, if it accomplishes as much as it
attempts, be equal to HANDEL’s, BEETHoven’s, WEBER's, RossINI's,
BELLINI's, DoNIZETTI’s; indeed to the music of all the great composers
put together. She must be a sort of musical SHAKSPERE-than whom
nobody else eyer succeded in giving illustrations of Phrenology, or the
Pºlº of human nature, at large.
To illustrate the whole of º by Music in one evening must
be impossible. The shortest way to do it would be by means of a
symphony, consisting of no less than thirty-five movements, if we are
to consider the “Love of Life” and “Alimentiveness” as established
organs. The latter of these might be elucidated, musically, by the
introduction of “The Roast Beef of Old England;” for the former, just
now, the best notion would, perhaps, be the Russian National Anthem
turned into a fugue, to signify PRINCE GoRTschakoff's troops saving
themselves as fast as possible from OMAR PACHA. But a series of per-
formances would be required by the extensive nature of the subject;
for any one organ, taken in all its combinations, might be played º
for a whole evening...Some of the organs are susceptible enough of
musical treatment: “Philoprogenitiveness,” or the instinct of paternal
and maternal affection, but more especially of the latter, has its melody
in the music of nature, as heard in the nursery, or issuing therefrom,
mellowed by distance—the mellower from that cause the better. The
effect in questiºn MRs, HAMilton (who appears to be a Scottish º
might produce by the judicious employment—it would have to be judi.
cious—of the bagpipes, “Acquisitiveness” rejoices in the jingling of
money, which might be expressed by means of the triangles, intrº:
ducing the appropriated air of “Still so gently o'er me stealing.”, “Self-
esteem.” would º its own trumpet, of course; the want of it being
expressed by transition to a minor key. “Destructiveness” could be
disposed of by a crash. “Combativeness” might come out in the
drums and fifes. “Firmness” might persist in a violoncello accompa-
miment. “Cautiousness,” slow and sure, would s in agentle adagio.
A lively allegretto would represent “Wit.” e music of Masonry
would supply some hints for “Constructiveness”. There are organs,
owever, which may rather puzzle a composer. No harmonious men-
sures that one can well imagine would give any idea of “Form” or
“Size,” and “Locality” would seem to ſº quite out of the musical
Way.
ºis. HAMILTON informs the public, that she will lecture on living
heads from the audience, assisted by the celebrated MRs. CARTE
“the JENNY LIND of Scotland.” Hence, it seems that the music wi
be, partly at least, vocal. It may be surmised that MRs. HAMILTON's
lecture consists principally of recitative, which would be more
suitable than an aria, a bravura, a canzonet, or a part in a duet,
to the statement of anatomical and Fº ical facts. MRs. CARTER,
we are told, will sing Scotch, English, and Irish songs. There is an
Irish song called “Donnybrook, Fair,” which alludes strongly to the
shillelagh, and may therefore be conceived to be very pertinent to
s. England, doubtless, has ballads adapted to various organs
besides the grinding; and in addition to “John Anderson my Jo,” and
many other songs of the affective faculties, there is a particular Scotch
song that might be very useful to a lecturer on, Phrenolºgy. , Mºs.
HAMILTON, in lecturing on living heads, may be ºbliged to describe the
upper story of some gentleman as being similar in its build to that of
the late MR. Rush. Any unpleasant feeling, or objection, on his part
to such a statement, might be quelled by Mrs. CARTER immediately
striking up, “A man’s a man for a’ that.
Whether Phrenology is made any clearer ºr not by Mrs. HAMILTON's
musical illustrations of it, we dare say that those illustrations are
anyhow very well worth hearing.
Fine Feeders.
. It appears that the Sheriffs of London are fined from £500 to £600,
in the guise of a subscription to the LoRD MAYor's Dinner. Now
this is a tolerable fork-out, for any one who can stand it, even if
destined to the promotion of a º: object, but considering what kind
of º; it is actually squandered on, we must call it a knife-an
fork-out that is quite intolerable.

The EMPERoR of Russia has drawn his money out of the Bank of
England, which he seems to identify with that of the Danube, whereon
a handsome check was presented to him by the Turks.

EGLECTED SCOTLAND.
---, A SENSIBLE ScotchMAN writing from
Haddington to the Times,
says that “the real griev-
ances of Scotland are not
her insulted Lions, nor her
deserted Holyrood,” but
lie in “her ill-paved, worse-
lighted and undrained mar-
ket-towns, and in the in-
curable apathy of the inha:
itants to sanitary reform.”
This gentleman says that,
on Tuesday last, at a meet-
ing of the inhabitants of
Haddington, it was, pro-
… posed to adopt the drain-
44, age clauses of the New Po-
mºl lice Act. After an earnest
| and solemn appeal from
their parish minister im-
loring them “to unite with
eart and hand in bringing
the influences of pure air
and water to bear on the
wretched homes of their
rer brethren,” followed
y an awful warning from a
medical officer of the town,
“the householders (many
of them wealthy men)” re-
jected, by a majority of ten
to one, a bill for their as-
sessment, in order to have
their streets and houses
cleansed, at the rate of 10d.
in the pound. .
A week previously, the
Scotch MAN states, the
Haddingtonians had de;
- - voted a day to fasting and
- - - - - the pºstilence might be averted from them.
Fasting involves self-denial. The Haddington fasters cannot deny themselves
to the amount of 10d in the pound. They cannot fling that tempence into the
gutter, to sweep it, although the gutter is poisoning their poor neighbours, and
mº poison themselves too.
hristians are supposed to wash their faces when they fast. Whether the
Haddington housekeepers accompany their fasting with any ablution may be
doubted, since they refuse to pay 10d. in the pound for washing their town.
By preference, for cheapness sake, they would rather perhaps fast in sackcloth
and ashes; but as all sackcloth is now used up in †. .. ashes are carted
away for manure, their fasting possibly consists in wearing their usual clothes, and
sitting still in their usual filth, and doing nothing. Whether they abstain from
anything else—from haggis or sheep's head, or collops, or whiskey-toddy—in
addition to abstinence from wholesome exertion—we do not know.
As to the Scotch Lion playing second fiddle in the Royal Arms, he may bless
the sometime Duke of ARGYLE and his stars, and be contented to have any
plate there to fiddle, in at all. By all heraldic right he ought to be ousted altogether,
and his place should be occupied %. more appropriate emblem of a Pig; a
whining, grunting, odoriferous Hog Rampant, sprawling in the filth of towns.

GARE LA GAROTTE.
OUR friend and contemporary the Sunday Times (whose zeal for the spread o'
mºcracy, for the non-suppression of Betting Houses, and for the purification of
the Turf and the Church, we gladly recognise), in commenting upon an excellent
article in which the daily Times dissuades the charitable from encouraging street
mendicancy, has the following startling remarks:–
"While on this... part of the subject, we would suggest the impolicy of withholding from the
metropolitan mendicants, whether impostors or not, the scanty means of support. . . ." we would
counsel the old, ladies and gentlemen not to hold their hands, lest the sturdy vagabond, who now
ºntents himself with extracting pence from their humanity by whining, should"take to stranging
them in the dark streets, as some members of the fraternity have lately done in Manchester."
Really, Mr. Punch, who believes that in his time he has done no bad service to
the cause of real Democracy (by which he means a system for the benefit of
the many and nºt of the few), begs to say that these utterances by the “ Champion
of Democracy,” are more worthy of one of the ruined clients of the Sunday Times,
the Betting House Keepers (who may now be properly, termed vagabonds), than
of a respectable journalist with his faculties in order. Threatening decent people
with strangulation because they decline to assist imposture, is rather a strong
argument. Luckily, there be things called Policemen.
PUNCH AND HIS PIPPINS.
ThE “immediate apple of our eye” is an American
apple, which we happen to have in our eye at the present
moment. It is not an apple of discord, but an apple which
comes home to our very heart's core with its assurances
of friendship. A Correspondent, who si himself “The
AMERICAN ENThusiast,” has allowed his enthusiasm to
take the very sensible turn of a present of apples to Punch,
who, while receiving it, proceeds to cut it up; and, like
some critics, shows his taste by making mince-meat of it.
We have perused the whole of the apples with great satis-
faction, and though we might find a spot here and there
the blemish is . on the surface; for, when we descen
a little lower than skin deep, we find the *f; quite
worthy of the appellation &f the "American Prince of
Pippins, which we hereby confer on it.
Interest for Prince Albert's Statue.
GIVE PRINCE ALBERT a Statue?—Yes, certainly, at the
roper time; may it not arrive for a thousand years!
uf when it, does, arrive, up with the Statue; a Statue
which shall have been merited by a highly useful life,
whereof the promotion of the cosmopolitan fair in Hyde
Park will have been one only among the remarkable acts.
In the mean time, that the memorial may be worthy of the
hero, put the money already subscribed towards it out to
increase and accumulate; by which means, in addition to
the interest which our descendants will take in the work,
we shall also transmit to them compound interest that will
help to pay for it.

HARD DEALING WITH A HAWKER.
Now, all men, that Falconry is no longer a
British pastime, but, Hawking continues to
be practised, though, like Shooting, it is
not lawful, without a license, and in that
case is punishable by a swinging fine. The
Susser and Kent Mail contains a distressing
illustration of this fact; which we subjoin:—
“TUNBRIDGE WELLs. PETTY SESSION,
Nov. 12.
“Before J. DEANE, Esq.
“HAwking without A License.—Michael DERLEY
was brought up in custody, charged with selling mats
without a license. The accused did not deny the
charge, but contended that he had a right to do so, as
he manufactured the articles himself. He had done
the same thing in hundreds of towns, and had never
before been interrupted; he had his mother and brother
to support, both of whom were deaf and dumb.
“Mr. DEANE inquired if the prisoner had been
cautioned, and on receiving a reply in the affirmative
(from P. C. Mona AN) intimated that he could not allow the statement of the prisoner
to influence his decision. The tradesmen of the town, as well as persons taking
2nt licenses for hawking, must be protected, and he (the prisoner) must pay a fine of
E10, or go to prison for seven days.
“The prisoner requested MR. DEANE to inform him under what Act he was com-
mitted.
“MR. DEANE declined to give the information.
“The Clerk to the prisoner—You can find that out when you get to gaol.”
Is there any mistake here? Was it for stealing mats that the prisoner
was committed instead of being sent to gaol for selling them If not,
does there exist a law so atrocious as to warrant his committal?—if
there is no such law, breathes there such a magistrate as MR. DeANEP
And does MR. DEANE continue to hold a place on the Bench *
The poor man appears to have had a judge, as well as a mother and
a brother, afflicted with deafness, if not dumb., MR. DEANE was deaf
to his appeal for mercy, and dumb when challenged to justify his
unishment. We cannot say, we hope that DERLEY obtained the in-
ormation which ke was so kindly . that he might seek for in
gaol. If no Act existed to warrant his incarceration, he would have a
legal remedy for what morally, at any rate, was a false imprisonment.
DEBATE ON THE HUDSON QUESTION.
(By slight Anticipation.)
IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT—Monday, 13th February, 1854.
House of Lords.
THEIR Lordships met at 5, but rose immediately, in order to afford
various Peers an opportunity of hearing what was going on elsewhere.
House of cowſ Mons.
Petitions, having been presented, notices of motion given, and
questions disposed of, - -
MR. Roebuck rose to bring on the motion which he had placed on
the book. He said he should be very short (A laugh). He could not
express his loathing and contempt for the vulgar and brutal ribaldry
which could find matter for a grin in a man's appearance. He should
be temperate, as all the world knew he always was (Hear, hear), and
should merely read to the House an extract from a document to which
the Hon. Member for Sunderland had sworn, and which that Hon.
Member had placed on record in a Court of Justice, in which MR.
HUDsoN—(Order) What was the * of the servile pedantry, that
adhered to rotten forms? (Order.) ell, in which the honourable—
very honourable—right honourable—would that do?—Member swore
that he had expended certain moneys, or used other means, in bribing
and º: members of the legislature to favour railway schemes
in which he was interested. , Conceiving that a legislator who could
bring such a charge against his fellows was utterly unfit to sit among
them, he should—without the least personal feeling—move that MR.
GeoRGE HUDson be expelled the House of Commons (Hear, hear).
Mr. HENRY in Mºnd seconded the motion, but only for the
}. of saying that he perfectly believed every word to which MR.
UDSON had sworn (Hear, hear). He had last session, given Lords
and Commons, aye, and Ministers and Knights of the Garter too, his
opinion of the extent to which º was carried in these days,
and he reiterated his assertions. Still, though offences were to come,
woe to them by whom they came, and therefore he should support
MR. Roebuck.
The SPEAKER having put the motion,
LoRD John Russell, as leader of that House, said that he should
make yery few remarks on a very painful subject. He had carefully
looked into Magna Charta, and also into the Bill of Rights, and was
inclined to believe that neither made any provision for the case of a
railway director who should endeavour to promote steam-traffic by
unlawful means. So far they were in the dark. But it was desirable,
nay, necessary, to consider rather the spirit of the constitution than its
exact letter, and he thought that if the House would refer the matter
to a Select Committee, º might attain their object. The instruction
to that Committee would be to inquire, first, whether steam carriages
were known in the days of KING John, and if not whether any portion
of Magna Charta appeared to bear on the case. Next, he thought, the
Committee might inquire whether, at the Revolution, steam travelling
had been invented, and how far the Bill of Rights might have con-
templated wrongful Railway Bills. On receiving the report the House
would determine on its next step. (Hear.) He moved an amendment
in accordance with his suggestion.
MR. DisBAELI was the last person to infuse into a question any
element not patently consanguineous with it; but, with all deference
to the noble Lord, he must respectfully inquire whether the noble
Lord's suggestion did not tend to the implicit stultification of the
House. Why, the noble Lord asked the Committee what he had
already told them himself, and did not ask that which it was momentous
to register; namely, whether in the chancery archives a damnatory
record had been deposited. º º
CoLoNEL SIBTHöRP said that the noble Lord professed a great deal
of virtue, which was all humbug. Facilis descensus Acerni. He believed
all Ministers to be knaves, especially when they most pretended to
decency. Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes. He should leave the House
(laughter); but before he went, he would just say that if the noble
Lord, instead of wallowing in turtle and champagne (laughter), would
introduce wise measures, he should be supported by wise men, himself
amongst the rest. Juder damnatur cum nocens absolvitur.
MR. G. H. MooRE said that had MR. Hudson been an Irish Member
he would have been expelled long ago, but, such was the beastly
bitterness of England towards his, MR. MooRE's, unhappy countrymen
that, as MR. Hudson usually sat near the Irish Members, he was
allowed to remain there in the hopes that he might contaminate the
high and pure morality which they had learned from their beloved
priests, * which shed a holy and blessed light around their path,
to the utter discomfiture of the bigoted, blatant, and blasphemous
Protestants.
MR. LucAs confirmed MR. MooRE's statement as to the virtues of
the Irish, and the wickedness of the English, and made an animated
attack upon the Church of England, adding an affecting history of the
persecutions to which Catholics were exposed in Protestant countries.
MR. DUFFY, MR. SQULLY, CAPTAIN MAGAN, and other Irish Members
having diated upon this branch of the subject for about two hours,
LCRD PALMERSTON suggested—he hoped that as-a-a-an, Irish
roprietor, he might be permitted to offer a hint to Irish gentlemen
% and cheers), that they were a little departing from the points
which perhaps offered themselves most prominently; at any rate–a–a
—so it seemed to him. (Hear.) Perhaps it might be advantageous
on the present occasion to —a—a—sink the Pope. (Great uproar on
the Irish bench.) Of course he meant nothing offensive to His–a–a–
Holiness. (Laughter.) Honourable gentlemen had certainly travelled
very far, but they seemed to have avoided Hudson's Bay. (Shouts ºf
laughter and cheers.) He thought, really, that as the #on. Member
for Sunderland was present, ſe might be asked whether he had
anything to say for himself. English gentlemen were not in the habit
of acting harshly or inconsiderately. (ºft cheers.)
AN IRISH MEMBER (indignantly). “Are Irish P”
LoRD PALMERSTON (laughing). “Qui capit ille facit, you know.”
There were then calls for—, ,
MR. Hupson, who rose, and said, “My position is noways pleasant
and I shall not intrude long upon the ouse. In the first place i
never said, exactually, that I had bribed members of the legislature,
but only that I had applied shares in a way calculated to promote
the interests of a certain company. . . What I’ve said, I’ve sworn
to ; and what I’ve sworn to, I stick to, of course. I don’t see
anything to be ashamed of in what I have done; but people differ on
these points, and every man has a right to his own opinion. The
ouse can do as it likes. But one thing I do mean to say, and that is,
that if the ouse has a bad opinion of me, l’ve a precious bad opinion
of a good many people in the ouse, and out of it too. What was I?

that ? Not I. They courted me. They came to my ouse, and ate
my dinners, and flattered my family, because I’d got a load of money,
no matter how; and because some of 'em thought they’d get a slice,
the others wanted me to put 'em up to dodges, to get money for them-

as the right hon. gentleman in the cheer has seen and knows, but a

me, some only nod. Is it because I’m worse than I was . No, only
because I’m worse off. My golden sunshine brought out the vermin,

and now that’s gone they’re gone too. You may expel me, but you

have taken, how Lords, and Barnets, and Guardsmen, and the Hort

and it's despicable cant to say it don't. I am in the ands of the ouse.’
The Hon. Member's address caused considerable sensation, especially
among certain strangers in the privileged galleries. MR. HENRY
DRUMMOND was observed to rub his hands with much enjoyment.
LoRD John RussBLL's amendment was negatived without a division
Mr. Rorºuck's motion was then "carried, and, on the motion $f
MR. WILSON, a new writ was ordered for Sunderland, vacant by the
expulsion of Mr. George Hupson.
THE FASHIONABLE ZOOLOGICAL STAR.
WE are sorry to see that the Zoological Gardens have lately got
into the “Star system.” Not content with a good working company
of bears and monkeys, they must have particular “Stars” to bring the
million in. Some time ago it was a º otamus, who made all
London run after him. Then there was the baby elephant, who was
a source of great interest to mothers. After them followed a chim-
anzee, and a serpent-charmer, and a whole forest-full of humming-
irds, and we cannot recollect what else. All of them, however, were
great attractions in their way; in fact, it may be said that the animals
lately have completely taken the shine out of the actors. As the
theatres have gradually become more empty, the Zoological Gardens
have perceptibly become more crowded. What actor, recently, has
had º like the success that for a whole season ran panting
pushing and squeezing after the Hippopotamus? It was a fight 3
parasols to get near him—it was a joy greater than that of a new gown
to have seen him! What is the reason of this strange preference P Is
it because the º: prefer Nature to Art?—or is it because the
actors speak, and the animals do not?
However, the “Star system” is not likely to be so ruinous here as
at most places of entertainment. We need not say that the Zoological
Stars receive no salaries, beyond their board and lodging; and they
are not likely, to ruin their managers with salaries, like those. They
are º regularly every day at the usual feeding hour, and we have
not heard of an instance of any animal, no matter how popular he may
have been, having struck for more beams, or refusing to make his
appearance unless he had a double allowance of paunches.
he latest “Star” at this establishment is the Giant Ant-Eater—that
is to say, if }. can call him a Star at all, for, with a tail like his, he is
much more like a comet. It is indeed a tail l-so long is it, that you
imagine it must have been originally published in four and twenty
numbers, and that they are here all bound up together. ...And a pretty
thick volume it makes too!" DANIEI, O'Consei's “tail” must have
been a wisp of straw compared to it. It hangs like a small willow
tree—only instead of being green, it is, a dark º colour, and, in
texture, resembles some of the long brushes we have seen made of
Indian grass. It is as flexible as a party-politician, for it can be turned
at will to any side. What is the use of such a tail it would be difficult
to say, though as far as that goes, you might as well ask what was the
use of a lady’s bonnet, for the cne is not worn more at the back than
the other. When the Ant-Eater lies down to sleep, he throws, this
voluminous tail, like a Scotch plaid, round him, and we have no doubt
it keeps him very warm. So, you see, it is of some use after all; and,
for what we know, as he comes from a very warm climate, the Ant-
Eater may use his tail in the summer to fan himself with. We are told
that he is met with in the plains of the Brazils; but, from his habit of
spreading his thick hedge of a tail all over his body, we should say that
he was much oftener found in the Bush. In fact, it is a complete furs-
bush—extending out nearly to the same length, as his body. He is a
curious animal, take him altogether. In shape he reminds you some-
what of a German pig, which is not the most elegant object a person
can meet with on a long day's journey; only a German pig would be
an English greyhound in symmetry by the side of him. #. Ant-Eater
is as hairy as a goat, and all along the ridge of his neck he carries a
long frill of hair that stands upright, short and thick, like a long plate-
brush turned upside down. Then the hair fails down his front legs,
taking the form of a pair of black top-boots. These front legs look at
first like hoofs, for the nails, the length of which any woman of spirit
would envy, are turned underneath, and the noise he makes in walking
upon them sounds exactly as if he had got clogs on. His snout, also,
is extremely peculiar, being admirably adapted, from its length and
narrowness, for getting the marrow out of a marrow-bone. It is longer
than any cucumber reared by a penny-a-liner, only gradually tapering
towards the end, in which is enclosed the tongue, to which it seems to
act as a sort of case.
This case is made of bone; and, really, when the tongue issues
from it, it looks like some very fine surgical instrument that had shot
out of its case upon a spring being touched. We hardly know what to
compare the snout to, unless it is a very long and thin strawberry
pottle, that some wicked boys have been tying over his mouth. This
strawberry pottle is his only feature, for his eyes are so small that they
are rather eyelet holes than eyes; but then, in its great bounty it more
than balances, and leaves a large surplus over, for the miserable
verty of his other features. We know of no other animal that could
|. so easily led by the nose. As for his coat, the hair on it takes
various colours. You, remark a long stripe of red running by the side
of a long stripe of black or $º . The colours, on his breast par-
ticularly, are as distinct, and the lines as sharply, marked, as the
different-coloured grains you see arranged in a seedsman's window.
The poor animal looks remarkably stupid, but happy. He wanders
about his cage in a .."; inquiring manner, looking for his, blessed
ants, whom he cannot find anywhere, and making with his claws the
oise of a French peasant walking in wooden shoes. He leads a very
hº life, being up generally all might, and sleeping all day.
ere his accomplishments seem to begin and end; for he does not
sing, nor bray, nor bark, nor low, nor whistle, nor make any noise
whatever, except the one with his toe-nails, which must be particularly
disagreeable during the night to the poor Čhimpaugee } olives in the
next cage to him. We tried very hard to dive into the Ant-Eater's
thoughts; but, with all our diving, could not bring up any satisfactory
proof whether the beast was aware of the great popularity he had
suddenly rushed into. Like BYRON, we suppose he awoke one morning;
and found himself famous. Let him not be too conceited, for “Stars”
rise and fall at the Zoological just as quickly as at other places.

SURE SYMPTOM'S OF CHRISTMAS.
(By a Surly Old Bachelor.)
UNCH,-I know Christmas is coming
from certain well-known symptoms
that never fail to present themselves
at this time of the year:—
Because my landlady is so ex-
tremely civil to me, and brings me
my shaving-water the moment I
ring for it.
plain for two weeks about my boots,
and the coal-scuttle is generally
pretty full of coals.
Because the breakfast is laid be-
fore I am up, and when I ask for
toast with my tea in the evening,
º: kitchen fire has not once been
Oult.
Because the impudent news-boy
has been much earlier with the news-
paper than usual.
Because, wherever I have called,
I haven't had cold meat for dinner
for ever so long—for two weeks at
least. -
Because I cannot get my bills in
from my º smile,
and scrape their feet in their vile
saw-dust, and murmur something about “any time will do, Sir,” and
present me with French plum and bonbon-boxes, and fancy I have
nothing better to do than to lay in a plantation of Čhristmas trees. -
I Because the crossing-sweeper takes his hat off to me every time
a SS.
ecause the Beadle has been wonderfully profuse with his cocked
hat, º i. pew-opener, within the last fortnight, has nearly curtseyed
me to death.
Because, wherever I have called, I have found, all the servants
smiling most unnaturally, and bringing me things I didn't want.
Because my little nephews have been so very affectionate to me
tely.
Because my little nieces have run }. to me
that was more flattering than sº 6, and ihave had m great coat
and hat and umbrella and goloshes miled off me before I have had
time to inquire whether my brother (he is only a clerk) was at home.
Because I have been bothered out of my life with so many inquiries
about that “distressing cough” of mine, and have been recommended
so many wonderful remedies that were sure to cure it, which remedies,
if I had only taken one half of them, I shouldn't be alive at the present
moment.
Because the Waits wake me up at night, paying me the discordant
compliment of playing opposite my window longer than anybody else's.
And because—but I think I have said enough of these symptoms,
which luckily “come but once a year.” After all, I don't know-
perhaps they are not so disagreeable, for the attentions one receives at
this period are as flattering to one's vanity as º are conducive to
one’s comfort. The worst is, one knows they all spring out of a
Christmas Box—and these boxes, as I have learnt to my cost, are not
to be had so cheaply as bandboxes. The enjoyment would be all the
more enjoyable, if one hadn't to pay so, dearly for it. During the
Christmas month, my outgoings invariably exceed, my incomings;–
otherwise, I like it well enough, and shouldn't mind if the whole year
were composed of nothing but Christmas months.

A Fit Punishment.
OUR Aldermen are such neglectful conservators of the river Thames,
that we propose, they should be compelled to bathe in it regularly
once a day, until some great improvement has been effected in its
inodorous management.
ARCTIC MONOMANIA.
Those who send navigators to discover the North-west Passage
remind us of Hamlet, although he described himself as only mad Nºrth-

OUR BOTTLE-HOLDER.
So, PALMERSTON's out ! and the cannie Scotch Peer
Whom he cuts, is in haste to be first with the story,
And, to poison our PAM in the popular ear,
Proclaims that for years our old friend’s been a Tory.
But Punch is afraid that another Scotch mull
Is marking the course of the friend of ST. NICHOLAs;
For the good MR. BULL is by no means so dull
As not to perceive that the charge is ridiculous.
What! PALMERSTON, Liberty's champion in need,
Who confronted oppressors with England's broad tegis,
And haughtily ordered the despots to read
On its blazon, the duties that Lords owe to Lieges
Who has fluttered, not º (like us, dear LoRD A.,
Who all “pigeon-livered, lack gall” to sustain us)
But Eagles, pread, Double. Re , Black, White, and Grey,
d cried” kenneſſ” to kings with his civil Romanus.
Whose name gives the sign for a chorus of groans, .
Where, crowned and anointed things #. in ermine,
And, where slaves crawl and slaver the footsteps of thrones, .
Sends them off to their holes, as the light does night vermin.
It really won't do. To your patron, the CzAR,
When the now.forming file of the newspapers comes, he
Will laugh out in scorn with a royal “Ha! haſ
To think ABERDEEN was so helplessly clumsy.”
So, call him what you, for about forty years,
h"ere—a Tory—or aught that comes into your noddle,
One only regrets that in these days one hears
Of sovery few Tories who're built on his model.
He remembers the service by PALMERSTON done
Since he took the portfolio, but yesterday hawked about ;
How, shoulder to wheel, he went through at a run
The work that all others had dawdled and talked about.
The grind for “six moons ° to the wife-beating brute;
The foot on the dens where turf-gamblers would cozen;
The foul furnace throats made to swallow their soot;
The yet fouler charnel yards closed by the dozen.
The lecture your Lordship's Scotch friends would not print,
Who against Sabbath-breaking so tipsily hiccup;
And the scourge he was knotting, by way of a hint
To bid ruflians reflect before taking the stick up.
All this, my dear Lord, in our tablet’s enrolled;
And we’d yº respectfully say to your Lordship,
That the tales of your organs had better be told
To those worthies, the resident soldiers on board ship.
For all the Scotch Lords who e'er blessed DUKE ARGYLL,
Pouring out all their spleen by the gallon-Scotch measure,
Could not poison John BULL from his jºlly frank smile,
When he says, “Punch, here’s PAM ſ” and Punch says, “Jolix,
with pleasure.”
[And they drink LoRD PALMERSTON's health,
An Extreme Test.
If you wish to ascertain the temper of a young lady, look at, her
nails, and the tips of her gloves. If they are i. and much bitten,
you may be sure she is peeyish, irritable, quarrelsome, and too ſº to
show her teeth at the smallest provocation. This is an infallible test
that every ill-tempered young lady carries at her finger's-ends. Do not
attempt to kiss such a young lady under the mistletoe.

REFINEMENT ON THE RANK."
Accomplished Cabman. “WILLIAM, wooly-woo Aqua'
AN AMERICAN JOKE EXPLAINED.
We don't understand American institutions—that's a fact. We
don’t understand the American Press; which is one of the greatest of
those institutions. Deficient in the sense of irony, we take the playful
abandonment—the jocose mystification—of the American newspapers
as simple statement. Hence multitudes of dull worthy people among
us will receive the New York Tribune's account of the reception of the
runaway convict, Mitch ELL, at New York as a prosaic and authentic
narrative of that event. Had GREENACRE, by some chance, escaped
the gallows, they will be inclined to think, he too would have been
hailed with enthusiasm and acclamation, as an accession to the worth
and manhood of American citizenship. For Mitch ELL resembled the
other chiefly in the circumstance of not having been hanged. He was
no mere political non-conformist and unsuccessful opponent of the
existing order of things, vulgarly and technically º a rebel. He
was a traitor in the vilest sense of the word: a malignant hater of the
QUEEN and the country: the sort of traitor that mediaeval, justice
contemplated when it sentenced the criminal so called to be hanged,
drawn, and quartered. He was a sanguinary cruel caitiff; a dogged
miscreant who not, only preached pike massacres, but, yelled and raved
for sulphuric acid, which he would have had rascals to squirt into
soldiers' eyes. Those, therefore, who are not up to American drollery
will naturally be scandalised by the seemingly sympathetic description,
given by the New York Tribune, of the advent of such a fellow amongst
the freest and most enlightened people on earth. Says our facetious
contemporary:-
“As the Prometheus came up the river, she was boarded by Messrs. Mragher and
William Mitchell, the brother of the patriot. The meeting between these friends
in sorrow and persecution was affecting in the extreme. Tears of joy were shed on
both sides."
Tears which scalded the cheeks down which they flowed; being
vitriolic. . Without this comment—which would have spoiled the
gravity of the burlesque—the Tribune proceeds:
"On nearing the wharf, the news of MR. MitchELL's arrival spread like wildfire,
and ships and piers were literally swarming with the immense throng who crowded to
give him a freeman's welcome."
No doubt this is the naked truth. There are, unfortunately, a great
many scoundrels and ruffians in New York who have an ardent admi
ration for a fellow scoundrel and ruffian. It is unnecessary that a New
York journal should explain that these vagabonds are not Americans:
But that explanation is requisite for our stolid readers, whom we will
presently tell who the wretches really were. An individual of the
noble and generous American nation would as soon think of hugging a
rattle-snake or a copper-head, as of taking to his bosom the venomous
and vitriol-squirting Mitchell.
As MR. Mitch ELL and his companions proceeded to their destina:
tion—which, notwithstanding the impulsive nature of American moral
feeling, was not the nearest pump-he experienced various honours
which the waggish reporter º his triumph enumerates with whimsi
exaggeration – particularising “roar º artillery,” “dense mass of
human beings,” the carriages that bore them, being “followed by the
throng,” his way resembling “the march of a conqueror”—not by any
means such a march as that of a man who is drummed out of his
regiment. His friends, the funny journalist avers, “were almost ready
to take him from the vehicle º carry him upon their shoulders,” and
he was “surrounded by a large number of the citizen-soldiery, and
NANchan's band.” Among these troops were the “Irish Rifles.
whose weapon, of course, is the vitriol squirt—the “MITCHELL Guard,”
the “MEAGhéR Grenadiers,” with “Cabbage Garden,” probably, em-
blazoned on their colours; and sundry other regiments and guards
..". * superfluous to inform the New Yorkers—were ragged
allu- -
Here lies the point of the whole joke. Misled by a parcel of Uncle-
Tom-foolery, we are apt to regard the coloured population of the States
as an oppressed race. They are, indeed, shunned and disliked; but
that is entirely by reason of their incorrigible villainy. They won't
work, but they will squat on an estate, and if compelled to clear off and
make room for industrious whites, they shoot the owner of the property
from behind a hedge. Rescued from starvation consequent on their
unthrift and laziness, they turn and curse the benefactor who feeds
them. Such were they who shouted welcome to MitchELL; and only
think how secure a people must feel in their republican liberty to
rmit a mob of savages to indulge in such a demonstration! is
ase and brutal multitude did not contain one American citizen. Their
bands are stated to have played Irish melodies, “Star S led
Banner,” “Yankee Doodle,” and other national airs. No, no. The
ragamuffins hated the stars as well as the stripes too much; and they
no more pla ed “Yankee Doodle” than MITchELL * “Rule
Britannia.” Their music may have included Irish melodies; but their
other national airs were limited to the class comprising “Lucy Neal.”
and “Ole Dan Tucker.” They were an assemblage of odious, mise-
rable, º: degraded brutes, connecting links between mankind and
the monkey. There was not a single Anglo-Saxon in the whole lot.
In short, they were all—Niggers.
CHARITY FOR CHURCHMEN.
UR friend the Bishop of London has pub-
lished a circular urging his clergy to exert
themselves to recruit the failing finances of
the Society for Promoting the Employment
of Additiºnal Curates in Populous Places.
Very good; let all the other º: issue
similar injunctions; and º: they will
not forget to point out that a great many
additional curates might be provided for
populous places out of the excess of income
enjoyed by pluralists, who are the incumbents
of º some of which are comparatively
uninhabited. Their Lordships º by
example as well as precept, urge their over-paid clergy to exert then
selves for the required object, by pulling out a large amount of their
superfluous revenues, if they can *i. stand so much exertion.
Perhaps it would be as well to try the effect of this exhortation on
the clergy first, and appeal to the laity, if necessary, afterwards.
The Real Reason.
LoRD PALMERston has resigned, Speculation is riſe as to the cause.
We are in a position to state ...i. that his retirement, is o
neither to the Eastern question, nor the Reform Bill, butto the des
of the active Home Secretary at the deluge of letters which he
drawn down by his offer made at Perth to listen to everybody's griev-
ances, and consider everybody's suggestions—an undertaking which he
has found himself so utterly unable to redeem, that he has determined
on withdrawing altogether from the attempt.

THE ALDERMAN’S HOPE.
STAND PRINCE ALBERT a Statue—it then mayn't be hard
To induce him to stand, by and by, for a Ward;
There ain't any lor, as Í knows on, agin it,
And there's nothing, as I see, preposterous in it.
The wery next year pop him into the Chair,
And have the PRINCE 8. himself for Lord MAYok,
With an out-and out Show on the ninth of November—
Of the PRINCE of WALEs that, too, 's the birthday, remember.
What a sight!—to behold it all London would trudge–
The RECoRDER presenting the PRINCE to the JUDGE,
Relating his history, birth, education,
And how he has always behaved in his station.
His R'y’l Highness to see, his official robes drest in,
A countin' the hobnails—oh how interestin'!
The Illustrious News would set forth the whole story,
With a beautiful cut of the PRINce in his glory.
Only fancy the feast at Guildhall—'t would be splendid,
And then what if the LADY MAY'Ress condescended
To honour the spread—and to give circulation
To the Loving Cup—kissed to her liege Corporation'
Why there we should witness—whilst we was a-dining—
The Mace and the Sceptre in friendship combining,
Bound together with garlands of laurel and myrtle;
What a comfort to view as we sucked up the turtle !
Because we should hail in that union a token
Of a tie to be never undone, cut, or broken;
And a§: that, as long as the Crown stands unshaken,
form London City shall save its fat bacon.

Man Loves—with a Saving Clause.
An Old Maid, who confesses to thirty-five, says: “She doesn't
believe—not a bit of it-in the nonsense that men talk about breaking
their hearts! It's her firm belief there never was a man yet who broke
his heart—or if there was, that he broke it as a lobster breaks one of
his claws, another one shooting up very quickly in its place.”
THE DEMON OF THE MONEY-MARKET.
ANY success gained by the Russians over the Turks causes a fall of
the funds of course; because the Czar's invasion of the Principalities
is in fact a mere Bear Speculation.

LIFE AND DEATH ASSURANCE.
AMong our Provident Institutions are Life Assurance
Societies for Parents, which are Death Assurance Societies
for Children. They are otherwise called Coffin Clubs. They
engage to find the money for the coffin: the subscriber, father
or mother, finds the occupant for it—by murder.
The Grand Jury at the Liverpool Assizes has expressed its
opinion that the temptation thus afforded should be destroyed
by law. That might be done, perhaps º: the §§
from paying anybody on account of a death but the undertaker.
But what need of such clubs at all?
Such clubs, are necessary to protect the poor from º;
ruined º a. º expense. But why the heavy expense:
When I have shuffled off this mortal coil—what does it want,
except to be put reverently underground? Cannot that be
done for a very small sum of money? Why is it not done on
reasonable terms? Simply because the mode of doing it is
not reasonable. Its performance is attended with a useless
sacrifice of furniture-necessitated by the tyranny of custom
—to show what is falsely termed “proper respect.” Proper
respect is affectionate memory—not furniture.
hould, I want “proper respect” to be shown to my leg,
if I had the misfortune to lose it, by having it enclosed in an
ornamental box, and deposited in a subterranean apartment,
with a large expenditure in wages, coach-hire, silk, and crape,
and feathers extracted from the tail of a great bird? If the
leg is not to be treated with such “proper respect,” why is
the trunk?
The rich show “proper respect” by means of ostrich feathers
and such like. The poor are obliged to follow their lead as
# º Call *... farther. Hence Coffin Clubs—whence
anticide.
Superior Classes, every nail that you drive to show “proper
respect,” is an incentive to child-murder.

Frost and snow, keen Christmas weather, and the biting winter wind,
Bid us lovingly together huddle closely, all mankind; . .
Blood is on the Danube freezing; wounds are agonized with cold,
Only for the sake of pleasing one proud felon uncontrolled.
All good souls are now beseeching blessings on their fellow man,
But one savage, overreaching, brutal despot, thousands ban.
On the field of battle lying, torn and mangled for his whim,

THE HANWELL COOKERY BOOK.
So much progress has been made in that humane treatment of insane
persons, which allows, them to follow, their ordinary callings and
pursuits, that nearly all the in-door work of many lunatic asylums is
now performed by the patients.
Thus at Hanwell there are lunatic gardeners who º their
parterres and greenhouses in a most rational state of order and neat-
ness, and we have not heard that the cracked violinist, to whose music
his poor companions are allowed to dance, is in the habit of mixing up
“Pop goes the Weasel” with the Dead March in Saul, or committing
any similar instrumental yagary, as many might expect. #:
by the success of the gardening, washing, ironing, tailoring, and other
experiments, the Directors of this noble establishment have recently
attempted to extend this |...}. of the insane to the higher branches
of household ceonomy—including the great mystery of the kitchen.
But insane cookery, to judge of the specimens of the Hanwell cuisine
which are now before us, does not seem likely to turn out so well as the
simpler arts to which the presence of the wits does not appear absolutely
indispensable. It is to be feared that the digestions of the inmates
of the asylum might be seriously impaired by such dishes as the
following —
Soufflet à la Bombardino.
Take three-quarters of a pound of Dorking lime, two ounces of the
best saltpetre, and a coffee-cup full of tin tacks. Beat well together
with a whisk, bake for seven minutes and a quarter; add a few horse-
chestnuts, a handful of cow's hair, and a gill of lemon juice. If the
cook be a dissenter, or have secretly married the butler, the lemon
juice may be omitted.
Apoplectic Jelly.
Take four hundred kangaroo's eggs, and when, the water is hot
simmer gently, stirring in dandelion leaves one by one: strain all
through a thin deal board, and set it by in a pint basin to cool. This
will keep for any length of time (if DR. Conolly is not allowed to look
at it), and will serve as a vegetable for sick people or .# children
If not sweet enough, add some indigo and a pound of steel-filings.
Oltenitza Pudding.
Take some old Russia duck and shred it in a slew-pan with as much
water as you can pour in without putt . the fire out. When the
feathers are loose pluck, them out carefully, and mince with forced
meat for garnish. Put in half a tablespoonful of salt, a bunch of
chopped straw, and a little grated pumice-stone, then add the rice.
Sweeten to your taste, dress with your garnish, and serve in a napkin,
A few tea-leaves sprinkled over, will make it look more inviting. If
anybody comes into the kitchen while the stew-pan is on the fire, put
it under the table.
Methuselah Fritters.
Have some castor-oil boiling, slice three, large heads of mangel-
wurzel, and put them in your castor-oil till quite crisp. Try them
with your finger. If done ºft they will burn you. Add three
oysters, a nutmeg, a teacupful of brown sugar, and a capsicum. If
more flavour is wanted, you may add a tablespoonful of Bath brick.
Serve up hot on a gridiron. If for a second course, tripe, may be sub-
stituted for the mangel-wurzel, but oil of vitriol is preferable.
Croquettes à la Conolly.
Steal a marrow-bone from which the marrow has been taken out,
and burn it till charred. Then scrape it into a butter-beat, with two
spring onions minced, an oyster-shell, and a quarter of a pound of dry
glue. Put up in shapes, and let it stand till it is mouldy. Have some
treacle cold, and when it boils, dip your croquettes in it one after
another, and serve up in the middle of next week. If made with
marine glue they require more care, but will eat all the crisper. The
yolks of two shop-eggs may be added, but this is a matter of taste, and
unless the eggs are very stale they will i. your croquettes too mutty
a flavour. Sºme roll the croquettes in the ashes, but this is not to be
recommended, unless where there are foreigners at table and a many
servant is kept.

SERJEANT ADAMS ON A KNOTTY POINT.
º * MR. SERJEANT ADAMs
occasionally makes sen-
sible remarks. In the
course of the other day,
º
§ / º
Zºº,
for instance, alluding to
some misrepresentation
of his opinions on the
system of flogging, which
had got abroad, he is
reported to have said
that
“He had for years watched
the progress of that system,
and had had ample opportu-
nities of doing so, on account
of so many children tried be-
fore him; and he had so fre-
quently found that the com-
mencementofachild'scriminal
history was with three days'
imprisonment and a whipping,
and after that beginning the
child so constantly came back
to this court, that his mind
quite revolted from passing a
sentence involving whipping
at all.”
“Give a yºf
a whipping, and, have
done with him,” is a
º of Common Sense for the cure of
mmon Sense, however, sometimes, jumps to
Sense uttered pre-
thief
common
juvenile delinquency.
conclusions which are not verified. Common
ictions concerning gas and steam, which have not come to pass;
And the views of Common Sense concerning discipline for youthful
very
offenders are perhaps rather too summary. “Give the young thief A
whipping ”—very good. The thing is done with small expenditure of
time and material. It does not take many minutes: it is attended only
with a slight wear of whipcord: cost you a farthing, as MR. PEPys
would have said: and a certain laceration of human integument, cost
you absolutely nothing. You lose nothing whatever in raw material.
Therefore inflict the whipping on the young thief. And have done
with him? Ah! “If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well
it were done quickly.” But it appears that you won't have done with
him. On the contrary, after †. beginning, the child º
comes back to this court, as Assistant Judge ADAMs says. After all,
is it not manifest even to Common Sense—if Common Sense will exert
itself—that to attempt the reformation of a child—and for what else
would you punish a child?—by whipping him, is really, beginning at
the wrong end?. The application o lie scourge belongs, to the
operative part—the surgery—of the treatment of criminals; , an
operations should be resorted to only when all other remedies have
failed. . Primarily, the whip lacerates the skin; but the laceration, is
succeeded by hardening of the part that was lacerated; but not only by
that: by the induration, also, of any amount of heart that the patient
may previously have been endowed with. After such a beginning, no
wonder that he comes back to this court or that. . No.: the lash is a
valuable application, so is lunar caustic, so islapisinfernalis, or the actual
cautery itself... But reserve it for desperate cases.
in those of subjects that have lost all sensibility to every other appeal.
Keep stripes for the ruffian who savagely º his wife; for the
hopeless brute, for the irreclaimable blackguard. And administer
them to him in such a dose that he will not readily come back to any
court to have it repeated. But a little whipping is a dangerous, thing.
It degrades and brutalises without subduing. You must lash a human
being like a hound if you want to conquer him as you would conquer a
hound—and it surely would be rather too severe to carry flagellation
to that extent with juvenile offenders. It is not fair, moreover, to use
the rod till you have first tried the schoolmaster.
Very Unseasonable Intelligence.
QNE of “Our own Correspondents,” speaking of the recent disaster
at Sinope, rather startles us with the announcement that
“Turkey for the present is unquestionably worsted."
If this be literally the fact, we only hope our country friends will
postpone their usual hampers until Turkey is itself again.
SEASONABLE INCONSISTENCE.
A Jovial, young printer of our acquaintance having declared the
other evening that he had left off work, was found under the misletoe
a little later most busily employed in printing kisses.
Resort to it º l
UNEWENHANDED JUSTICE.
OUR old friend, SIR PETER LAURIE, in his recent modest letter
to the Times upon the legal (as well indeed as social, moral, and in
fact universal) worth, and excellence of our Aldermen, marks with a
special note of admiration the †† fact, that the number of
acquittals from our City Police Courts falls considerably below the
usual percentage. Recollecting SIR PETER’s old propensity for “put-
ting 3. we are, in some degree prepared to find that such a
fact as this should be a matter of rejoicing with him. SIR PETER
clearly holds that the proof of the trial is in the finding guilty, and he
has, doubtless, but a low opinion of those judicial courts where mercy
is allowed to “season justice.” “The rigour of the law” is clearly
no unmeaning phrase in SIR PETER LAURIE’s eyes; indeed, we almost
doubt if Juder damnatur cum innocens absolvitur be not in reality his
first legal maxim.
Whatever SIR PETER’s present faults may be, there is no denying
that he has rid himself of an old one. We cannot certainly accuse
him of tenacity of opinion, when he shows himself so evidently prone
to conviction.
CLERICAL TABLETURNERS AND SPIRIT-BAPPERS.
2–~ LERICAL gentlemen are going about the
z -º country, giving entertainments, and
- making, exhibitions of themselves, in
& NN - - - -
Nº. connection with table-turning, spirit-rap-
H. and other freaks of iture. The
*-*- ual places of amusement, such as the
tº concert-rooms, and lecture-theatres, are
being occupied by clergymen, who admit
the public at fixed prices to hear, but un-
fortunately not to see, the wonders on
which they expatiate. By way of Extra
ATTRACTION FoR. The Holidays we re-
commend any one of the Reverend
Mountebanks to go the whole hog, or
rather the whole ma-hog-any, by taking
some establishment suited to scenes in
the circle, and giving an entertainment,
with a programme something resembling
the following:—
THEATRE ROYAL ANYWHERE.
General combination of Table-turning talent. By a happy concur-
rence of fortuitous events, the REveREND SAMrson Spooney, the
REVEREND MEALY MoUTHPIECE, and the REVEREND JABEz JAwBox.E
are now in London together and will have the honour of appearing in
conjunction with the
Most Splendid Stud of Highly-Trained Tables.
For a few evenings, during Christmas, SAMPSON Spooney in his
rapid act of horsemanship on the
WILD TABLE OF The NEW Cut.
This astounding table will dash through an open window, spin round
for a quarter of an hour, and conclude its wonderful performance by
eaping out of the circle, with the REVEREND SAMPson Spoon EY hang-
in; on to its castors.
To be followed by the
REVEREND MEALY MOUTHPIECE AS THE COURIER OF EXETER HALL,
On six dining-tables in full gallop, all of which will take an astound-
ing leap over each other's backs; and conclude by throwing a succes-
sion of somersets over a sideboard.
In the course of the evening, the
REVEREND JABEz JAWBONE, IN THE HAUTE £coLE,
will introduce his
Favorite and Highly-Trained Table “Rosewood,"
which will dance the Walse à Deua Temps, go round the circle on three
legs and terminate its graceful evolutions by a marvellous display of
sommersaults.
The entertainments will finish with a pleasing act by MASTERs
JAwbone and SpooxEY, the celebrated juvenile prodigies, on a pair of
card-tables. The intervals of the performances will be filled up by the
solemn mummeries of the celebrated clerical buffoon, the REveRENT
TIMOTHY Twist, assisted by a Deathless Clown from lyrury Lane, and
other available talent.

and it, “but entirely through the
severity of the weather, which,”
MR. Som MER adds, “as all musi-
cians well know, has a most de-
trimental effect on all brass in-
struments º such as
mine).” It thus appears that the
alleged misunderstanding between
Mr. Som MER and his instrument
was a mere coolness on the part of
the latter only. The notes seem
to have been partially frozen in;
and if, during the subsequent thaw,
any of them came out again, as
in a memorable instance, erhaps
MR. Som MER will state the cir-
cumstance. Possibly, as the Som-
merophone had got a cold, it would
have completed its solo later in the
evening in question, if its proprie-
tor, had given it a basin of gruel
and put it into hot water before
going to bed. We have no doubt of the truth of that gentleman's
assertion as regards most brass instruments; but he is mistaken in
extending it to all. It has not been observed in the House of

brazen instruments, as well as for tenors and sopranos, we shall
| be constantly troubled with excuses on behalf of some capricious
trombone seized suddenly with an affection of the windpipe, and, in the
trombone, the pipe through which the wind is conveyed is of a some-
what delicate texture. The Professor threatens that his next per-
formance, shall be accompanied by a full orchestra; but if it should
happen that all the brazen instruments are suffering from bronchial

CHRISTMAS WAITS EXTRAORDINARY.
(From our own Reporter.)
THERE are some remarkable additions to the usual Waits this year,
which the papers have uniformly neglected to notice. As Corrector.
General of the Press, it devolves on Mr. Punch of course to supply the
omission. Half a moment's reflection will, he thinks, convince any of
his readers who would be styled “intelligent,” that—
There's the EARL of ABERDEEN Waiting—for the protracted war
which will result most probably from his protracted peace policy.
There are the Rotten Boroughs Waiting—for the expected #dom
Bill which is to put them in good odour.
There are the Inhabitants of London (and twenty miles about it)
§ºor the extinction of that truly burning shame, the City
-lax.
There are the Keepers of the Betting-shops Waiting—to evade the
recent Act which a ntly has shut them up.
There. are the Women of England Waiting—for a law that will
effectually protect them against brutal assaults.
There are the English. Tourists Waiting—for hotels where they may
enter without being let in,
. There’s many an English Operative Waiting—to find that his strike
is in the end a heavy blow to him.
There’s many an English Curate Waiting—to find that his income
will exceed a London footman's.
There are the Readers at the Museum Waiting—for the end of the
world, or that of the catalogue.
There's the Corporation of London Waiting—to be crushed by the
Commission which is now sitting on them.
There's the Emperor of Russia Waiting—for the spring which will
enable him to jump into Turkey.
d finally, There's Mr. Punch himself Waiting—very pleasantly on
The Universe with his Twenty-fifth Volume.
WHAT Is THE Womid LIKE?—Why, the world islike a stubble-field
—in which the greatest geese generally pick up most of the golden
gralms.

MISSISSIPPI BREAKING IIER BONDS.

With base manacles load him; with vile shackles crush,

Beneath the hard burden and weight of a Loan
To be sure, though, Spain has had the courage to get
The directest way out of the irons of debt.

It don't take but one stroke, and 'tis done smooth and slick;
Hurl the bits off to fly on the wild winds aſar!
Unless you keep one just to light a cigar.
For they are but paper—is paper to bind -
The young le to Earth, when to scar he's a mind?
He will snap the weak chain the first instant he springs
With the sun in his eye aud the steam in his wings.

On themselves, and the hiss of the world can defy P
What is debt? Don't the talented EMERson sa
We have got other debts, besides money, to pay
We reckon those other debts due first to fall,
The cash debt’s the one which we'll pay last of all;
That's the genuine rule by which true Genius goes
In settling the endless account which it owes.
From the glorious fact, that our bonds we have bust,
Let mankind learn the lesson of thorough self-trust,
Though our sister States credit may cease to obtain,
And no mortal will trust Mississippi again!
