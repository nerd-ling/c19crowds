IT having become known in the highest temporal place of Merry
England that MR. PUNch was about to complete the Twenty-Sixth
Volume of his immortal work, he was aroused at an unusually early
hour from his pillow, by the Lord CHAMBERLAIN, the bearer of the
commands of HER. Most GRAcious MAJESTY, to the effect that
MR. PUNCH should attend with his new Book—his last gift to a
delighted and enlightened generation—at the Crystal Palace; a fitting place, as it was pleasantly observed
to him by the Court functionary above-named, wherein to dedicate to the Royal Consideration the brilliant
and varied wonders of his last completed Book. -
Magnificently printed in letters of virgin gold on white satin—“the worms were hallowed that
did breed the silk”—was the Royal Command, to the following brief but heart-warming summons:—
* Buckingham Palace, June 26.
“Mr. Punch is commanded by HER MAJESTY to attend at the Crystal Palace, at Two o’Clock
to-morrow, to present to HER MAJEsty his Twenty-Sixth Volume.”
“Morning Dress.”

iw PREFACE.
MR. PUNCH will not attempt to describe the attitude of the British nation on this event. No sooner
was it made known to the world that he had received the Royal summons—no sooner was it an
assured truth that he would take his blithesome way to Crystal-crowned Sydenham, than the whole
population in the line of his progress made every possible demonstration in order to glorify and do honour
to so great an event. Every possible sort of tapestry decorated the balconies. Hearthrugs and patch-
work quilts vied with one another; and multitudinous brass bands made resonant the welkin with the
air—“See, the Benefactor comes.”
Arrived at the Palace, MR. PUNCH-his new volume under his arm—contemplated for awhile the
People's Eden, in which the mighty gardener Joseph is planting so many Trees of Knowledge. And at
once soothed and strengthened by the beauties around him, he awaited the Royal summons.
HER GRAcious MAJESTY--punctual as the sun—arrived at ten minutes to Two o’Clock, and as Two
sounded from the belfry of Sydenham church, M.R. PUNch—duly called by the Lord CHAMBERLAIN–was
face to face with her resplendent MAJESTY.
That Crystal Knight, SIR. Joseph PAxton—having received the Royal Command to such effect—
introduced to the QUEEN, with whom were PRINCE ALBERT and the Royal Children,_MR. Punch and his
Volume. MR. PUNCH was about to lay his book at the Royal Feet, when HER MAJESTY condescendingly
desired to receive it in her Hand, and having beneficently smiled upon it, gave it to SIR Joseph, with
orders that it should be added to the Five and Twenty Tomes of Punch—all of which are enshrined in a
delectable Cabinet in the Royal Private Apartments of the Crystal Palace.
HER MAJESTY was thereupon graciously pleased to visit the Punch Court—a Court hitherto most
enviously neglected by contemporary literature, no notice of it having hitherto appeared in any of the
newspapers. The inspection of MR. Punch's Court having been honoured by many musical laughs, the
QUEEN returned to her Chair, and declared
Čt ſurnt-Siri ºnlimt of #mt; publishū.

PUNCH'S ALMANACK FOR
1854.
CAPER SAUCE.
A very scrupulous
maiden lady of our ac-
quaintance classes the
Ballet among the in-
delicacies of the Season.
THE MATRIMONIAL
§. m º only
ng in which the whi
should not be j.
is the wedding-ring.
—Whenever it is used,
you may put it down as
a badly-managed circle
that is a disgrace to the
ring.—Widdicoma.
DRAMATIC TRUTH.-
A promising actor
should perform as well
as promise.
WHAT's IN A NAME?
—More than some peo-
ple think. Don't o
a sausage-shop in
eaton Street.
PRoPER DIGNITY. –
Stand no sauce from
any servant but your
cook.
WHEN is the soup
likely to run out of
the saucepan 2–When
there's a leek in it.
REMARKABLE DaRAM.
–An inveterate punster
having fallen asleep,
dreamt that Ma. Hobbes
had picked Teddington
Lock.
'at-
PRovers (for a Tem-
perance Medal). – You
may take a Teetotaller
to the Pump, but you
cannot make him drink.
MONTHLY MEMS. BY A CAbby.
JANUARY.-Cruel 'ard weather. Bad entertainment for man
an' 'oss. Rough your cattle and your tongue. If you drives
a night-cab, get inside when on the stand, pull up the win-
ders, and smoke. Bacca airs the wehicle, and you can, if
objected to, say it was the last fare. Much may be done at
the second-rate skvares, where they gives parties, by keeping
up proper ties with the linkman. Encourage º:
connexions, wich there is generally a public 'andy about the
mews, and draining a pot at your expense will make him
strain a pint in your favour. º: about the legs
is much worn this month; and your 'oss's rugs will make a
comfortable rap. As for the 'oss, he's the master's look out,
and you needn't care a rap for him.
FEBRUARY.-A sludgy month, bad for chilblains, and con-
sekvently good for cabs. Parliament opens, wich the Cabman
For-hunter. “HERE's A
A CASE OF REAL DISTRESS.
Bohe, JAck!
FREEzing LIKE MAD !”
will not forget wot he owes to his horder, and never leave his
rank to take up hanything so low as a Hem P. You may
be 'ailed by MR. FitzRoy if you stands oppersite the 'Ome
Office. Let him "ail. The more he'ails the better. Remem-
ber to keep a few bad tizzies about you. The man as asks
for change for a bob desarves no better. If anything is left
in your cab, bone it. 'Eaven 'elps them as 'elps themselves;
and if Cabbies doesn't 'elp themselves, who 'll 'elp 'em, I'd
like to know? Wooden-soled shoes is recommended for
watermen in this mºnth, as they are obligated often to be
gutter perchers. A silk 'ankwercher twisted round the 'at
is nobby, and keeps out vet.
MARch.—A blowy month; but a good blow out is the
last thing likely to come in a Cabby's way, now-a-days.
Don't stand no March airs from customers. But wotever
you do, avoid the Beak, for a Cabby in the Police Court
now-a-days is like this blessed month in the halmanack—he
goes in like a lion and comes out like a lamb.
The gRound Is HALF A Foot THICR WITH SNOW, AND IT's
| Prophetic.
Nº. The National Debt
s will be paid off by MR.
~iº- BRIEFLE88 with a draft
- º on the well-known and
\º highly respectable Bank
of the Serpentine.
THINGs in SEASON IN
JANUARY.-Cold chops,
flounders (in slippery
weather), and (cork)
soles.
EARTHENWARE At
S.E.A. – In the stormy
ocean every vessel is a
pitcher.
THE PHILosophy of
BRIBERY--It is with
the votes of men, as
with their actions: it
all depends upon the
way in which you treat
them.
ADVICE to FARMERs
— Feed your poultry
well, and you will in-
sure full crops.

PUNCH'S ALMANACK FOR 1854.
MONTHLY MEMS.
By A CABBY.
APRIL-Lockout for April fools,
every day o' this month as well as
the first. Weather given to change,
but don't you foller its example.
The Cabman as carries anything
under shillins (unless bad tizzies
as above pinted out) may go further
and fare wus and wus. Season
begins to get lively, and "Ansom
Cabbies is in request among swells.
The Guards' Club is good for them
as can go the pace, but the Rag
and Famish ain't no good, nor the
littery clubs. Avoid the neigh-
bourhood of Westminster"All. It's
'ard to say if a Hem P., or a lawyer
is wus. One made the Hact and
tother knows it.
The WATER CURE A Fact.—
The Water Cure has been intro-
duced in a peculiar class of cases.
A bucket or other large vessel of
the wholesome fluid is suddenly
emptied over the patient, and the
cure is instantaneous and certain.
The diseases thus cured are those
numerous affections comprehended
under the term shamming; but it
has long been known that plain
water is the best of all remedies
for plants.
How To Look AT THINos.-One-
sided views are sometimes the
best – for instance, if you are
taking the portrait of a person
who squints.
CockNEY HAgrology.--St. Mary
Axe. Of the biography of this
saint little has been recorded, but
her name indicates the probabilit
that she was of an inquiring mind."
FACT For Young SportsMEN.—
The easiest bird to catch in a trap
is the greenfinch.

No | I Don't see ANYTHING—UNLESS, PERHAPs, YoU-A
MIGHT REPAINT THE PRINCIPAL FIGURES, AND–I—YES-I SHOULD CERTAINLY GET A NEW |
BACKGROUND IN.”
MAXIMS FOR THE POLICE.
HoNEsty is the best police-y.
When you see aleose fish, “hook
it"—if the fish don't.
Between two cooks a policeman
often comes to the ground.
Necessity is the mother of inven-
tion; so when you find it necessary
to make a charge against somebody
you have locked up, invent one.
He was a fool that said, “Strik
but hear." A policeman shoul
strike here, there, and everywhere.
Disgusting Exhibition. - A
brute in human shape lately under-
took, for a trifling wager, to devour
(uncooked) 12 cabbages, 18 spring-
greens, 2 ropes of onions, and 10
artichokes. We understand that
the only excuse given for this dis-
gusting performance was, that the
fellow was a Vegetarian.
The BLINdNEss of ForTUNr.—
It is just as well that fortune is
blind, for if she could only see some
of the worthless persons on whom
she showers her most valuable gifts,
she would immediately scratch her
eyes out!
A SENTIMENTAL Screw. — A
mean author told his wife that i
did not pain him so much to see
natural flowers fade, as to behold
artificial ones go out of fashion.
Tobacco AND Total Abstix-
Exce.—A female lecturer (of the
curtain class) says that she has
no objection to the pipe without
the bowl.
The Sponting Body AND LIMBs.
—A large proportion of the Mem-
bers of the Turf are Legs.
ALLowance Te Witnesses.-
For a nervous witness no allowance
is made by a bullying counsel.
A DANGERous Rival.-Be your

MAY.—A pious and pleasant month about
Exeter 'All. Quakers is no good; but
awakened females may be worked, as many
is from the country, and can't stand bad lan-
guage. Reading a tract on your box is a
good draw. Also Greenwich parties begins,
and parties taken in to (white) bait. Tra-
falgars and Crowns and Cepters never axes
no questions after dinner; but Ships and
Hartichokes is no gentlemen. Spring onions
is now in fashion, and relishes well with a
slice of dubble Gloucester. The Darby may
be calkilated on, and the sveeps, JAck-IN-
the-GREEN, and my lord and my lady. In
takin' a fare to Hepsum, mind you never
drives your own 'oss, and gets your money
fust, for there and back. You are safe to
lose your fare, and in course, there's no
'arm if you can pick up afresh 'un 'ome—
the fresher the better. Turn up the cushions
for spoons, wich loose silver is hoften left
about by gents after lunch, and it is your
dooty, accordin' to the Hact, to restore
missin' property. If you don't know who
it belongs to take it to your unkle's, and
it will be off your'ands and mind. Zephyrs
is now fashionable, and heverything looks
green, includin' customers, a great comfort
to Cabbies and lovers o' nature.
Paophetic.—A novel entertainment will
be given at the Mansion House by a Cab-
man, who, while before the Lord MAYor,
“entertains” the idea of pleading guilty
to a summons for insolence.
DELICACY AND REFINEMENT.-At the
MissEs SNoBay Ns's Select Establishment for
Young Ladies, tuition is provided in
arithmetic in all its branches— except
Vulgar Fractions.
HINT on YAchting.—A steam yacht will
be found more economical to keep than any
other, as it admits of the application of the
screw principle.
TASTE IN BUILDING, An architect—of his
own fortune—says that he cares about no
capital but that which belongs to a column
of figures.
A PROBLEM (to be worked out by a newly
married Young Lady)—A sufficient quantity
of linen for the manufacture of her husband's
shirt being given—to make it.
THE POLICE WEAR BEARDS AND MoustacREs.
Frederick. “Now THEN, WILLIAM, wor ARE YER wartin' For "
William. “Why, I wos A-THINKIN' vFTHER I should wear My MoosTARCHERs
LIKE THIS HERE OR LIKE THAT HARE.”
THE DISAPPOINTED ONE.
IMPROMPTU AFTER EVENING PA-Tr
It must not be—nay, Maiden, nay-
Thy prayer, alas! is futile quite:
What tho' I pledged my hand to-day,
I cannot dance with thee to-night.
'Tis not that I have ceased to love
The whirling waltz, or fast galop:
Nor that I hold myself above
A mild and quiet “carpet” hop.
'Tis not that I intend a cut
That thus thy wish I disappoint:
Nor has some fairer rival put
Thy nasal organ out of joint.
"Tis not—but why these fables moot?
Dissimulation's art I scorn:
'Tis simply that a curs'd tight boot
Has sadly pinched my favourite corn!
How To PRUNE YoUR AcquaixtANCE.-
This pruning can be done either by cutting,
or by throwing cold water. A combination
of both systems will, doubtless, do a great
deal; but if the pruning-knife is judiciously
applied in cutting off the dinners and
suppers which the acquaintance princi-
pally come to eat, it is astonishing what
a number of them will drop of, more
especially those dead branches which are
not worth retaining. The quantity of grub
you will get rid of in this way will be
enormous. An old scarecrow erected on
i." grounds, by getting your mother-in-
aw to come and live with you, is not a
bad plan for pruning your acquaintance, as
it is sure to frighten a certain number away.
PRESERVES without SUGAR.—Take tur-
nips, beans, barley, wheat, oats, rye, or clover,
in any proportion of acres; to these add a
few young plantations and coppices, and do
them in covers: stock with hares, partridges,
and pheasants, and set keepers to watch.
Trout in rivers may be preserved the same
way. These preserves are expensive; but
very filling: they fill the County gaols.
Advice to All who ATTEND Epsom RACE3.

August.— Parliament's mostly
up this month; and it would be
well for the Cabbies if it never

'osses' mouths must be washed

Cabbies would all be done by their

them as you'd be done by. Avoid
hoysters this month.
Convey Axces.—The simplest
form of conveyance is the stretcher.
An ordinary mode of conveyance
is by the collar, when the party
is technically said to “stand
seized.” Sometimes a simple
conveyance has peculiar append-
ages: as when a party is taken
by he skirts of the coat, which
establishes another party in the
chal acter of “tenant in tail." The
ordinary draft conveyance is the
police van.

FICTIONS OF THE LAW.
That a person is at liberty to
ill-treat his wife to any extent he
likes, providing he does not ex-
actly kill her. (This fiction was
very popular at one time, but is
becoming now a little out of date.)
That a man is at liberty to take
his wife to Smithfield Market, and
to sell her for a pint of gin. (This
fiction is in great circulation on
the continent, and is in large
| demand amongst French novelists.
The fiction has been dramatised
more than once.)
That any such sale is valid, and
that the husband is at liberty to
marry again, and to sell and to
marry as often as he pleases.
That Shooting the Moon, is a
legal sport—specially sanctioned
and provided forby the Game Laws.
That a man ever recovers his
property by going to law;
That there ever were two such
ersons as John DoE and Richand
or.
That the Queen, whose name is
most unwarrantably used on writs
and other legal documents, knows
anything of the way in which you
are being served out.
That all persons are equal in
the eyes of the Law—or else how
comes it then that “the longest
purse" generally wins?
That the Law recognises no dis-
tinction between rich and poor;
when a rich man can divorce his
wife by paying a couple of thou-
sand pounds, and a r man can-
not obtain a divorce without going
to the workhouse !
FALLAcy of APPEARANCEs.-At
the richest dessert, after the most
sumptuous dinner, it may be often
observed that the fattest and jolli-
est-looking men are given to pine.
THE RITES OF HOSPITALITY.
Ir Hospitality has its “rites," it has also its wrongs. For
If Hospitality gives you a bad dinner and a bad glass of
wine, would you call that a "rite,” or a wrong?
If 'Hospitality takes the warmest seat near the fire, and
leaves you shivering at the other end of the room, should you
instance that as a “rite,” or a wrong?
CURIOUS CHINESE DEFINI-
TIONS OF MAN.
The Inquisitive Man thrusts his
head into a beehive.
The Contented Man cuts his
own hair.
The Extravagant Man keeps
his coals in a volcano.
The Hasty Man drinks his tea
with a fork.
The Reckless Man is like a dog
in a sausage-shop.
The Passionate Man picks his
teeth with the tail of a dragon.
THE LAw's DELAY.- If, in
the celebrated arbitration-case of
PAR1s and the Apple of Discord,
the three goddesses–VENUs, Juxo,
and MINERVA—had been each de-
fended by counsel, we wonder
when the case would have come
to an end ? The apple would have
been thrown into 8. as a
matter of course, and the chances
are that the celebrated judgment
would not have been delivered at
the present day!
A CURIOUS CHANNEL OF
COMPARISON.
WATER is, in many points of
view, a singular reflection of
Periodical Literature, which we
were not aware of before we had
looked into it. For instance, it
comes out in sheets, and when a
sufficient quantity is issued, it is
collected into volumes, but how
many sheets of water make a
volume, we cannot say. The frost
will bind a volume of water in a
variety of ways, and it is astonish-
ing the number of volumes every
year that are “bound in Russia;"
and there is this further resem-
blance between Literature and
Water, that, send them up by any
high pressure you please, they are
both physically sure, after a short
time, to find their own level.
THE MOUSTACHE MOVEMENT
Fred. “How Do You Like THE ALTERATION, BLANCHE "
Blanche. “WHAT ALTERATION, DEAR 1 "
Fred. “WHY, HANg IT 1–HAvKN'T I cut of F MY BEARD AND MoUSTACHIos I”
CURIOUS CHINESE SAYINGS.
When a man seeks advice and
won't follow it, they compare him
to “a mole that's continually
calling out for the newspaper."
A drunkard's nose is said to be
“a lighthouse, warning us of the
little water that passes under-
neath.”. If a man is fond of dab-
bling in law, they say “he bathes
in a sea of sharks.”—The father
who neglects his child is said "to
run through life with a wild donkey
tied to his pigtail."—The young
wife of an old man is compared to
“the light in a sick bedroom."-
Their picture of ambition is "a
Mandarin trying to catch a comet
by putting salt on its tail."-An
mock philanthropy has been de-
scribed by one of their greatest
poets as “giving a mermaid a pair
of boots.”
NEGATIVE WISDOM.
Wr never knew a “Selling off."
where the purchasers were not in-
cluded in the Selling.
We never met an English tour-
ist who could drink a glass of
Continental beer without inwardly
regretting it.
We never eat an oyster opened
by an amateur, that didn't taste
like spoilt periwinkle mixed with
gravel walk.
We never knew a “plain' cook
(by advertisement) who would con-
descend to dress herself as plainly
as her dinners.
We never met a cockney so san-
guine of longevity as to hope to
live to see the river Thames de-
odorised.
We never knew a shop-boy take
to betting, whose “settlements"
did not lead eventually to a penal
one.
And we never knew a London
wife who did not “for the chil-
dren's sake require change of air
in August.”

SEPTEMBER.—Town gets flat, and you
must look sharp. Gents and 'osses ankers
after waterin' places. If pulled up about
distance, swear through thick and thin,
but avoid pedometers. “Measures, not

werry wholesome, and if neglected, is apt
to bring on fevers and colera. Avoid
unripe fruit – especially 'winkles.

spend it, wich it's no use pullin' you up if
you’ve got nothink.
HOW TO GROW A PINK OF
FASHION.
THIs Pink must be planted in the most
aristocratic soil. The mould should be the
very mould of form. It grows mostly in
the open air, and Belgravia may be looked
upon as the great nursery for these Pinks.
Several favourable specimens, also, have
been reared at the theatres, the Italian and
French operas, and similar fashionable
forcing houses. It is met with in great
F. at the balls of the nobility. The
atter specimen, however, cannot bear the
daylight. It is put into a hotbed the first
thing when carried home in the morning,
and there it remains closed up and almost
dead until the evening, when it just begins
to lift its drooping head. It is about twelve
o'clock at night that it is seen to the most
blooming advantage. Your Pink of Fashion
is watered with a liquid called champagn
and, if it is at all faint, a little piece o
chicken and ham, and a few crumbs of
bread, applied to the mouth of the delicate
flower, will revive it wonderfully. It is a
very tenderplant, though it has been known
to bloom for two or three seasons. The
greatest care, however, is requisite to keep
it from the cold, for its beauty is so sensitive,
that the slightest neglect will nip it in the
bud. The Pink is of several colours, but the
white with a beautiful maiden blush is the
specimen the most preferred. This Pink
usually carries its head very high, and,
though not distinguished for any particular
amount of scents, still it is eagerly taken in
hand in society for its (s)talk. The Pink of
Fashion is mostly single, but cases of double
Pinks have been recorde. The double (or
married) Pink, however, does not excite one
half the interest of the one that is single.
HOW TO MAKE
BITTERS.
A BITTER CoMPLI-
MENT.-Ascertain in
what a person is most
deficient, or what he
requires or wishes for
most, and then com-
pliment him slyly on
it, as if he actually
possessed it. That is
a “Bitter Compli-
ment."
A BITTER TRUTH.—
If a person has any
defect, such as a club
foot, or a squint, or
bad teeth, or an ugly
wife, or has lost a
leg, or his hair, and
ou remind him of
t; or if he has been
guilty of anything
he has reason to be
ashamed of, such as
writing in the maga-
zines, or riding out-
side a penny omni-
bus, and you make
allusions to it before
company – that is
what constitutes a
“Bitter Truth."
SHAviNG BY MA-
CHINERY.—The º

nery that we are
acquainted with ... is

POP GOES THE QUESTION.
“Pop goes the question,” has often led
people a very pretty dance. It has been
a pop that has always been exceedingly
popular, and is revived from time to time,
as much from necessity as fashion. The
step is a very decided one; but though
usually regarded as difficult, yet a little
boldness and address is all that is required
to make the gentleman a †: proficient.
The steps are taken as follows;-Gentle-
man advances and bows to lady; chasse
to lady's side; hands across: balancer,
and set (on a chair). Lady (makes) ad-
vances, and retreats (into herself); gentle-
man follows (up his advantage), and

November.—Fogs this month
may be turned to account in many
ways by the industerous. Always
take time-fares. You can always
lose yourself, and the thicker the
fog is, the thicker you can lay it
on. Also, remember fares taking
change can't see the colour o' your
money. If you've a spite at your
master, now 's your time to pole
an 'oss. Likewise remember,
articles left in a fog ain't so likely
to be mist. If you've got a great
coat, now double the cape, or look
out for rheumatics.
DECEMBER.—The Hact says you
ain't to leave the stand, but you
can keep the pot a bilin' by makin'
slides on the pavement. If old
gents tumbles down, sarves 'em
right for walking in such weather.
Remember barrels of oysters, and
reasonable luggage, and cod-fish,
should be charged as passengers.
Pretty pickins at the railway
stations; what with turkeys and
geese, it's hard if a poor Cabby
can't drop into a Christmas dinner.
Goose-clubs comes off, and Christ-
mas hoxes at the theaytres; but
avoid the pantymimes, wich
children only reckons two as von,
and fathers o' families is shocking
bad pay—always 'aggles, and tries
to shove in an odd 'un. In con-
clusion, let Cabbies stick together,
and they'll soon make Com-
MissionER MAYNE turn tail. If
you goes to church, mind you
prays for MR. FitzRoy as druv
us to despiration. I wonder where
he expecs to go if hever he gits
into a cab!
A Bootless JoxE.—The ready-
made shoe-shops only keep one
size, for each shoe is a foot long.
UnakasonABLE BUTchery.—Critics are not satisfied with an
artist's picture being hung, drawn, and quartered (in the Royal
Academy), but they must afterwards proceed to cut it up.
How To PLOT OUT an
EVENING PARTY.
SIFT card-rack for most respect-
able acquaintances. Frame in-
vitations with lace-borders. Sweep
drawing-room quite clean, and
shootrubbishinto back bed-room.
Map out an artificial parterre on
floor with chalk. Sow seed for
seed-cake, Gather mustard for
sandwiches. Beat about the bush
for gooseberries, and put them in
bottles, to come up as Champagne.
Order in old man from green-
grocer's, and put Berlin bags on
his hands for gloves. Buy slip
for new dress, and gather flowers
in the Burlington Arcade for your
hair. Put the young twigs in
their beds, but the elderly plants
stick in library with cards. Lay
traps for rich young men. Plant
your company in rows and couples,
and set musicians in full blow in
corner of drawing-room. When
they are a little faint, water them
with Sherry. Hang wallflowers
round the room. Dig for com-
pliments, and run up a flirtation
wherever you can fasten one.
Above all, nail a husband, or else
your plot will be without its
greatest ornament and centre.

| lºs NEW YEAR'S EVE IN GUILDHALL.
an APOLOGUE FOR ALDERMEN.
HE Pigeons of Guildhall, meek emblems of civic innocence, had
folded their wings within their nests, and were slumbering in peaceful
forgetfulness of the hall wherein “the love of the turtle” had so often
kindled “the rage of the vulture” in the breasts of those to whom a
fifth basin had been denied. - - -
Occasionally a dyspeptic dove, fancying himself the inhabitant of a
pie, would start from his uneasy dream, flap his wings, and utter a
plaintive coo, but this passed, as one may say, in a coup d'ail, and
silence once more reigned in the hall, Gog and Magog, contrary
to their usual custom, preserved an unbrºken taciturnity, and stood
knitting their shaggy brows and blinking their great eyes in profound
and painful meditation. But the clocks which now chimed out the
mystic hour of nine aroused these worthies from their reverie, and
springing lightly from their pedestals, they began to illuminate the
hail, by i. ing several rods of office in moonshine—a process which,
as Gog º remarked, would give light enough for civic purposes.
This done, they unbolted the great door, and gave admission to a
crowd of men and women attired in festive though quaint garments,
but wearing on their countenances an anxious expression traceable, no
doubt, to the cause which had
“Sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
The native hue of sturdy Gog and Magog.'
Those colossal warders, stationed on either side of the door, received
the names of the visitors, and took the cloaks, hats, and swords of
such as were disposed to give them up. We should observe that
before the door was opened, Gog laid his cap on a little table before
him, and placed in it two rose nobles, three or four marks, and some
smaller coins, as baits for the generosity of the guests.
* Good Master. Frowicke,” said Joºs pe. Gisons, a grave
citizen, to a graver, and a grocer, who walked in with him, “I shall
have you to understand that mine eyen have seen to-night that of
which they were in no way fain. I did but go down #. Lane to
look how my old house of Gerrard's Hall bore itself, and to gladden me
with the sight of its bravery, and lo!...it was clean gone, and in its
place were, f'. not what new buildings of great size, but of small
beauty. I espied in the street an old wife, who sold a baked fruit,
about the bigness of an apple, the like of which I had never seen, an
uoth I, ‘Good wife, where is Gerrard's Hall?’ ‘Gone to the Cristi
allage, Sir, quo' the wife, ‘You’ll see it there some day, Sir, along
with the house of Pompey, I'm told, Siri'. Conceive now, MAstER
FRowicke, what I felt on hearing this. Had it been one of the nine
worthies, whose house they were to show with mine, it had not moved
me so much. But who was this, Poyºpey?, I trow the magnates of
this city should have stayed, ere they dealt thus with the dwelling of a
chief citizen and of a benefactor to the city. We were wont to say,
MASTER FRowicke, that an Englishman's house was his castle; but,
methinks, if they deal thus with his castle, he must needs have an
elephant, as well, to help move it.” -
You speak sooth, worthy Sir,” said KATHERINE_HARDEL. “I also
went down to the Smethefelde to look upon my Hermitage, for you
know when my master, WILLIAM HARDEL, quitted the mayoralty and this life, our Kinº HENRY THE THIRD, gave me forty feet of land to
build an hermitage thereon, in which hermitage I lived an ankeresse for º ears. Marry it was pleasant to look out from my cell on
the green fields and pleasant pastures, which the Hospitallers and the nuns o dºwii and the canons of St. Bartholomew held, and to
hear the fowles singen and maken merry, and to, see the sote flowers springen in the meades, and the young maids and bachelors *"...i
in the summer evenings by the side of Turnmill Brook. And, had I minded such vanities, I might have seen therefrom many joustes an
tourneys, and many noble deeds of arms, done to win a look from ladies' eyes, amongst which it were unbecoming in me to say that mine had
once been held the brightest. And now in place of the sweet pastures #. find nought but houses of the worst kind, and pens for cattle
where the lists had been used to stand; and when, thinking that the wretchedness of the place might mortify the flesh and sadden the
spirit, I asked of a boy if ever an anker dwelt there yet, he made answer, that he knew no house with that sign thereabouts, but that

the Three Drovers, in Long Lane, had good mild
early purl was stunning, whereat I i.i. much.”
DAME KATHERINE’s lamentations loosened the tongues of all in her
neighbourhood. “Where are the walls?” cried one. “In the sewers,”
answered another. “Where are the wells, and brooks, and bosses of
fair water?” asked a third. “Choked with dirt, or turned into
ditches,” replied a fourth. “I found the chapel wherein I was
baptised and marrica,” said a fifth, “doing service as the cellar of a
broker's house. The fellow told me that some people, whom he called
a society of antiquaries,” (here Stow and #. Wolf groaned
audibly) “visited it about once in twenty years to note the progressive
accumulation of dirt in it. . One of them wanted to buy and take away
a quaint corbel that had grinned at me during mass for º years; but
the broker and he had not as yet been able to agree upon the price.”
“My masters and mistresses all,” said Gog, in his blandest tones,
“while you are lamenting the disappearance of objects º dear
to you, the institutions of the City are themselves threatened. . Charges,
often made in the old time against the magnates, are now bruited about
on all hands. They are accused of using the power their station gives
them to advance the interests of their own relatives. Dost thou
remember, worthy MASTER GERARD BAT, how, when the King made
thee refund forty pounds which thou hadst taken, during thy Mayoralty,
from the Victuallers, thou didst murmur ‘Heu / Domine, ºr his possen
filiam meam maritare /* If thou dost, thou canst sympathise with the
mºdern magnates. They are accused, too, of wasting the revenues of
the City, just as thou, SiMoN FITz-MARY, didst in thy shrievalty; for
the which and for other pravas et detestabiles mores, thy aldermanate
was taken from thee. Thou, SIMON, wast the founder of Bethlehem
Hospital, and it concerns thee to know that a Governor of that house
whose name differs but little from thine, is one of those men, and seeks
to excuse their conduct. And, moreover, they are accused of taxing
the commonalty to benefit themselves—a fault which thou, GULIELME
cum BARBA, didst allege against thy compatriots. It will soothe thy
perturbed spirit to know that those who play thy part now-a-days are
ale, and that their
like to be more successful than thou wert, and that the magnates are
like to come by the worst.”
At these words a great clamour arose in the hall, but presently
Stow was heard to say: “We have heard our good friends MASTER
GIzoRs and DAME HARDEL to speak at length of changes in this city,
whereof, indeed, I have set down somewhat in a little book of mine
own; and MASTER Gog hath assured us of yet further changes to be
passed upon those by whose neglect those alterations first complained
of came about. Now in respect of buildings and their decay, I have
not only read in old records of dwellings destroyed to make room, for
§.” indeed, some report that a Roman temple stood where
STER Gizons dwelt in after time—but I have seen hearths and
pavements of Roman brick and tile dug up some twenty feet from
under the houses which you and your fathers built. And in regard to
civic government, MAster HENRY Fitz-ALwyN, here, will tell us
that before his time the city was ruled by port-reeves and º:
and that the aldermen had no part in its government until he had been
some time mayor. Whence I conclude that all things in this city are
in a continual flux and change, and that the manners of the coming
age will surely overcome those of the present time, as the buildings of
to-day are reared upon and overcrow those of yesterday, and as one
º of citizens hides its predecessors and their works under the
ust of its feet:-a piece of doctrine, which may go far to comfort
thee, MASTER GIzoºs, and to reconcile thy friends, MASTER Gog, to
their inevitable fate.”
The hall-keeper, dozing by the fire in his lodge, was roused by the
somi of voices in the hill.” “ijrat it?” said he to his wife, “I could
a sworn I’d locked it; them plaguey boys must have got in. I’ll sto
their larks.” He rose and peeped into the hall, but no sight or soun
met his eye or ear. It was empty, dark, and noiseless. “Werry
odd,” said he, as he returned to the fire, “It must have been them
pigeons;” and Gog and MAGoG, who heard him, shook on their
pedestals and chuckled, one to another, “The pigeons! Ha! haſ ha!
the pigeons !”
COMMON INFORMATION.
ERTAINLY, we , were
gratified to observe
se Training School
eeting at Win-
chester, LoRDASH-
BURTON had an-
23' nounced that prizes
would be awarded
for a knowledge of
common things.
Without the inten-
tion of competing
for these prizes, we
may remark that
colds and chilblains
are common things
at the present time:
though, headaches
and bilious disor-
ders, from over-
indulgence inplum-
- pudding and the
other delicacies of the season, are much more common. Other
affections, of a more sentimental nature, contracted in consequence of
olking, waltzing, and Schottische dancing, are likewise common; and
Goes the Weasel has become so common as to be a bore. Holly
and mistletoe are common—the latter giving occasion to a ceremony
both common and—just, now—proper. Christmas-boxes, are common
to postmen, or ought to be, considering how wretchedly that deserving
class of men is paid. This festive period is not the time for considering
whether, amongst common things, the House of Commons ought or
not to be included, together with the Common Pleas, the Common
Council, and the Common Serjeant, legal or military, as also Doctors'
Commons, amongst the various institutions which were—originally at
least—intended for the good of the community. We will only express
our conviction that it is very desirable to promote a knowledge of
common things; for the knowledge of common things is less general
than the knowledge of common places; however although we may be
saying what has been often * before, we wish the reader a happy
new year.

the Ministry. If his Lordship left the Government rather abruptly,
he, at, least made up, for it by the rapidity of his return, and we can
only, hope that, on this occasion at least, it will not be found that
“quick returns” lead to “small profits.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
QUESTIONS FOR THE REWEREND N. S. GODFREY.
REVEREND N. S. GoDFREy, S.C.L., of St.
Catharine Hall, Cambridge, and Incum-
bent of Wortley, Leeds, has been pub:
lishing pamphlets, price eightpence, and
holding forth at the Hanover Square
Rooms - admission Two. Shillings and
Qne Shilling—on the subject of TABLE
TURNING, to which he gives the rather
catching second title of “The Devil's
Modern Masterpiece.” . His pamphlet,
price eightpence, of which the “fourth
edition” is before us, he advertises as
“the result of a course of erperiments.”
As the reverend gentleman professes
to know all about it, we should be much
obliged if he would answer one or two
questions we desire toº' to him. In
ºn.
the age or the stage at which a table
begins to talk, and whether there is any
analogy between a child's cutting its
teeth and a table getting its legs or its
castors? Are we to believe that a table
cannot rap out a single word when it
has only put forth its leaves, but has
not yet found its legs—which form the
grounds of its understanding P. We
should also be glad if the REVEREND
N. S. GoDFREY would tell us if, in the
case of his experiments, he ever found a
table with an impediment in its speech,
or a stuttering table, or a table with a
hesitation in its delivery. -
We would also inquire of the clerical
experimentalist, if a table, like any other
talking machine, may be known by the
company it keeps? and whether a table
that has been accustomed to low societ
will be addicted to low language?
this should be the case, one would be
naturally cautious in E. second-hand furniture; for a table
that has passed its life in a gambling house, for instance, might have
become so dreadfully loose, that no reliance could be placed upon it.
šucia table seems to have fallen into the hands of the REVEREND N.S.
GopFREy, for on its being asked “How many lies have you told us to:
night?” we are told that “the table rapped briskly thirty-eight times,”
as if the mendacious bit of furniture was revelling in the fact of his
having extensively humbugged his reverend questioner. . As we are
told by this pious authority that the table always, begins with, “a
crack,” we cannot be surprised at the immense number of “cracks”
to which it confessed at the close of the conversation. Perhaps, how-
ever, the last might have been the greatest “crack” of all; and we
should therefore be glad if the REyFFEND N. S. GopyREY would tell
us, why the confession of a series of “cracks” should be more entitled
to credit than any other “crack” to which the table may give
expression.
THE FIRST DOG OF EUROPE.
In a good book in which MR. CRUIKSHANK (we do rot mean our
Temperate friend, GeoRGE) describes the African Gold Coast, he
says—
“The Africans are exceedingly fond of pictures in their rooms. Grong: The Fourth.
in his Coronation robes, may be seen disputing for space with Punch and his Dog Toby
as they appear in the frontispiece of his publication."
Mr. Punch has a loftiness which happily renders him perfectly in-
different to all insult; but is requested by Toby, who is of a more ex-
citable disposition, to say that he is quite incapable of such a dispute
as is here attributed to him. . Where GEORGE,THE Fourth, with or
without his coronation robes, is admired, Toby declines to compete for
homage, and nothing but the ignorance of these }; blacks can excuse
their hanging GEORGE within perfume-reach of Toby. However, Toby
hopes that missionary exertions may teach these Africans to set a juster
value on public characters.

their bonnets has been called the “neck plus ultra" of fashion.
HINT AND HYPOTHESIS.
SUPPOSE a young Foreigner crosses the sea,
In a vessel with Mammon not quite overladen,
And, coming to England, the good luck hath he
To win the kind heart of a true English maiden.
Suppose that her hand goes the way of her heart,
And friends who have loved her from childhood right dearly,
Settle, gladly, on him, from all charges apart,
An income—we'll say thirty thousand pounds yearly.
*; invite him to banquet and fête,
xhibition, review—every sight you can mention;
Present him with jewels, and pictures, and plate
And load him, in fact, with all kinds of attention.
Suppose that they take him to lay a first stone,
nd are eager to offer him trowel and hammer;
And when he makes speeches, they honour the tone,
Applaud the good sense, and forget the bad grammar.
sp. all is done that the best friends can do,
rom punctilious politeness to punctual pay-day,
In part, that he pleased them all round at first view,
In part for the love which they bear to his Lady.
Now, suppose that his wiſe has a trust of her own,
Conferred by her Guardian, not much of a burden,
Responsible, though, to that Guardian alone,
Like the place MR. JARNDyce bestowed on DAME DURDEN.
That so wisely and well she administers rule,
Understanding her work, both in letter and spirit
That her Guardian (suppose that his name is Jöns Bull)
Would floor the best man who should question her merit.
Now, if her young spouse, who has drawn such a prize,
Behaves like a º: first years of their union,
And even takes pains, by a graceful device,
To bring her and her neighbours in closer communion.
If he joins, like a man, in the sports of her friends,
Goes shooting, and ſishing, and hunting, and yachting,
And comes out so well that the prejudice ends,
That foreigners can’t help intriguing and plotting.
What a favorite he grows with the high and the low,
(With person, and sense, and accomplishment gifted)
But suppose that—talked over by people we know—
He lets us observe that his tactics are shifted.
That he meddles in matters which one might believe
His former good taste would enjoin his eschewing,
While, concerning some others, he ought to perceive
A graver objection to do what he’s doing.
That he talks to his wife on her Guardian's concerns,
Over which she should have unrestricted dominion,
And is oftentimes greatly displeased when he learns
She has done any business without his opinion.
That when she's disposed, at the urgent desire
Of her Guardian, to order some hºstile proceedings,
He seeks to dissuade her because it appears
Some friends of his own wish to settle the pleadings.
That he's losing the name he so quickly acquired
By a gentleman's highminded scorn of disguises,
Giving up the frank bearing old BULL so admired,
For mysteries the hearty old fellow despises.
sº all this—or a portion at least—
Mr. Punch, who knows neither to fear nor to flatter,
Believes that the wind will set strong from the East
The day John BULL JARNDYCE gets wind of the matter.
Caution to Wags.
GENTLEMEN are particularly requested not to make any jokes before
ladies in frosty weather, as the lips of the gentler sex are so affected by
the cold, that the slightest laugh occasions them to crack.

enters the lungs takes away the carbon from the blood and returns

eyes and ears.
Mr. P. Simply, my dear, that you, and LAURA, and EMILY, and
MATILDA, there—an indeed i myself—are all at this moment giving
off the most poisonous exhalations; and that it is a mercy, considering
the wretched principles on which this house is built and aii houses,
for that matter—that we are not found dead in our beds every morning.
Mrs. P. I declare you’re enough to frighten one to death, Joseph'

Mr.P. It’s a melancholy fact, my dear; I’ve had it on my mind some
time, but I’m determined to remedy it.
Mrs. P. (timidly). I hope you're not going to try any experiments,
my dear, because, you knºw, they come very expensive.
Mr. P. Experiments, MRs. PATERFAMILIAs; how can you call by
i. º of experiment a practical recognition of a great principle of
nature
Mrs. P. (humbly). Oh, I’m sure I didn't mean to do that, my dear.

Mrs. P. (in the purest innocence). Oh, indeed, my dear.
Mr. P. Yes, the plenum principle, you see, is that which blows pure
air into the house, so as to force an equal quantity of foul air out; the
vacuum principle, that which extracts the foul air from the house and
so allows the entrance of an equal..". of pure air.

S long as we live we
shall remember the
“Woices of the Night.”
of the 26th of Decem-
bcr, 1853, as they played
on the drum of our
affrighted ear at Drury
Lane Theatre. But amid
all the cries of various
descriptions that burst
forth from the noisy
multitude, there was
one which excelled all
the rest, and reminded
us of the cry of Ex-
CELSIOR, so powerfully
described by LoNGFEL-
Low. The reminiscence
has thrown us into a
poetical fit, of which
the following convul-
sive effort is the im-
mediate consequence.
The Pantomime commenced at last:
The Clown across the stage had passed;
A youth, with frantic energy,
Commenced the wild eccentric cry,
“Hot Codlins l’”
His throat was hoarse, he paused beneath
The pressure of exhausted breath,
But straightway through the audience rung
The shout—the whoop from tongue to tongue-
“Hot Codlins!”
The youth, with superhuman, might,
ltaising his voice beyond its height,
Cracked it, and with a spectral tone
He twixt his lips went on to groan–
-- É. Codlins !”
“Don’t try it on,” the poor Clown said;
“I’ve not a note in all my head-
I cannot sing.”. But far and wide
The audience with one voice replied—
“Hot Codlins !”
“O stay !” the manager expressed;
“The weary clown requires rest.”
A voice responded, “All my eye'."
And then again arose the cry,
“Hot Codlins!”
“Think of the work he has to do,
Tumbling about the whole night through.”
This was the argument polite., .
A voice replied from º: height—
“Hot Codlins !”
In the last scene, where fºys combine
Round Harlequin and Columbine,
To bless the fond and grinning pair,
A voice cried through the startled air-
“Hot Codlins !”
A little boy upon the ground
Under the gallery-seat was found,
Still in a shrill abortive squeak-
Trying the oft-heard words to speak-
“Hot Codlins !”
When the poor Clown had gone away,
And on his scissors-bedstead lay,
In lodging very near the sky,
Up to the attic came the cry-

PUNCH'S SCHOOL OF PRACTICAL DESIGN.
IN consequence of the publication of a letter from the Department of Science and Art
informing us that the Department “will be glad to receive drawings executed in ink lines of
any peculiar objects likely to be known and recognised by children,” we have much pleasure
in submitting a few specimens which we think any child will be able to recognise. Considering
that the object of “ #. Department" is to supply “examples which the scholars may take
home and copy,” and that the time employed in learning the art of drawing, “will not amount
to perhaps more than forty hours in the year,” we feel that the amount of proficiency likely
to attained will be about equal to the artistic effort required for copying the specimens
we furnish. The “Department” recommends for imitation the example of a Master at
Chester who has upwards of 1000 scholars under his charge.
“He draws an object on a black board in the presence of the class, explains the mode of holding the pencil, &c.,
the point for beginning the object, shows the principal lines of construction, &c., catechizes the children about the
form of the object and its meaning. Leaving some parts unfinished, he asks them if he has drawn it complete?
if not, where it is incomplete? how it is to be made complete? &c., and thus excites considerable interest in the
work among the children. He summons the classes to show their work on their slates.
of the best and worst performances, and criticises them in the presence of the children.”
Having taken a black board, we proceeded to draw upon it a round body, thus—
and our pupils having recognised a hoop, we went on to ask the most intelligent of them
how the round body might be transformed into an animal. A dirty-faced little fellow,
who had received in all twenty-three minutes of tuition, sagaciously suggested “legs,”
showing that he had detected the “incompleteness” of the figure with a sharpness that
the “Department” of Science and Art would greatly ire. Following out the

and having inquired of the class what was wanted
to complete the drawing, we were met with loud
cries of “head” in all directions. This we at
º supplied, and we arrived at the annexed
result
when a scholar more astute than the rest de-
manded the addition of “eyes, nose and mouth,”
which, as will be seen from the sketch that
follows, gave us the drawing of a perfect animal-
It then became our pleasing duty to ascertain
the extent to which the drawing would meet
with recognition, and the class of animal to
which it would be assigned by our youthful
pupils. This led to some uncertainty, for there
arose a variety of shouts, in which we distin-
ished the names of several different animals.
me pupil recognised in the drawing “a cat,”
another shouted that it was “a dog,” a third
said it was “a hare,” and a fourth remarked
that as it was not like any animal that he had
seen, “it might be the hippopotamus.”
Hoping to be more successful with an inani-
mate object, we drew the following—
and had the satisfaction of hearing a general cry
of “cab" from the whole class, which proved to
us that our mode of tuition—in conformity with
the system of the Department of Science and
Art—had been eminently successful.
We shall be happy to comply with the request
expressed in the circular of MR. Cole, and will
furnish the “Department” with any quantity
that may be desired of the material of whi
the above are specimens.

CHILD’S PARTY IN DOWNING STREET.
(Described by good MR. PUNCH for his young friends.)
“CoME, my dears,” said old GRANDMA ABERDEEN, as she sat
minding the § arty in Downing Street on New Year's Eve-for
they had begged so hard to sit up and hear the year rung out, that the
soft-hearted old lady could not refuse them—“come, you have romped
about long enough, and I am fond of peace, you know. Draw your
chairs round the fire, and we will have some quiet game. MASTER
CRANwokTH, you sit down on that cushion, and TeR CLARENDON,
please to put that bit of lighted cane out of your mouth. No
smoking here. PAMMY and John NY, why do you look so cross at one
another?—you have had a miff again, I know. For shame upon you!
CHARLEY Wood, my dear, you are always in good humour, get
between those two., GLADDY, my child, put down your slate, you are
an industrious boy, but there is a time for everything. Now, who will
tell me a story?’
“I will, Grandma,” said little John NY RusseIL. “In the time of
KING John, there was a thing called Magna Charta, which—”
But here, Mr. Punch is sorry to say, MASTER PAMMY and one or two
others burst into a very rude laugh, and said that John NY RUSSELL
was always beginning stories about Magna Charta.
“I will ask a riddle,” said smart_MASTER OSBoRNE. But they all
said they would not hear any of MASTER OSBoRNE’s riddles, because
he learned them out of the end of the Boy's Own Book, and of course
they knew them all by heart.
MASTER PAMMY then proposed cross questions and crooked answers,
but Grandma reminded him that they were all going to a *g. the
31st, where that game would be the chief sport of the night. So, after
some discussion, Grandma proposed that they should all tell one story.
“All of us in one story, Grandma P” said little John Russell.
“That will be funny. We have never been in that before.”
“The way is this,” said Grandma. “One of you will begin and tell
anything he likes, and go on, telling it until I call to the next, who
must immediately carry on the story in his way, and so on with the
next, until you have all done. It is a favourite game in many places,
and great fun; and each boy will show his character by the way he
carries on the story.”
There was great applause at this ; and each boy began knitting his
brows and thinking as hard as he could. ter a few minutes,
GRANDMA ABERDEEN called to John Russell to begin...They all set
up another laugh, supposing they should have Magna Charta again;
but John NY, who is a cool, self-possessed little fellow, smiled, and went
on steadily enough.
“There was, once upon a time, a very big giant, whose name was
Nick, and he dwelt in a city built on piles by an icy river. He wore
eat black boots, and a moustache, and when he drove about his king:
om, the poor horses were made to go so fast, that they often i
down dead—for he was a cruel giant. He loved to tear people from
their happy homes, and send them down dreadful mines, where the sun
never comes, or to shave their heads and make, soldiers of them, and
have them half-starved until they were killed in doing his wicked work.
Also, he was a great liar-”
“My dear,” interposed Grandma, “I do not like this beginning.
Perhaps you do not know all about the poor giant, who may have been
a good creature and done these things for the best.”
‘I know him,” shouted that audacious PAMMY, “and of all the
rascals—” - -
“Hold your tongue, Sir,” said Grandma, “it is not your turn yet.
Go on, Johnny, but be gentle in your language.”
“This NICK,” continued JoHN, who now began to hesitate, “this
NICK was hem, a-a--a despot. In our happy country, we have
a—a—a constitution, which is a long word, and Pºi explain it. In
the days of KING John, there were noblemen called Barons—”
“Go on, MASTER GLADSTONE,” said Grandma, seeing the party
grew impatient. .. -
“Barons,” continued MASTER GLADSTONE, speaking, very fluently
and gracefully, “who, weary of the despotism of their ruler, conceived
that there were three courses open to them. One was to kill him, as
in the case of KING CHARLEs; another was to expel him, as in that of
KING JAMEs; and the third was to º him to sign a charter of
freedom. This latter they adopted, but I am free to confess myself
unable to discover what this has to do with MASTER Russell's nar-
rative, I will therefore say that this, NICK, being one day in a great
rage, determined to rush into a neighbour's kin i. and commit all
kinds of ravage. He sent soldiers and ships, and to throw people off
their guard, he said his prayers, very loud. Now this neighbour had
some strong friends, who wished to save him, so—”
“So what, MASTER CLARENDON ?” said Grandma.
“So,” said MASTER CLAREND9N, “they wrote a lot of pretty notes,
not in very good grammar, I believe, to §: telling him he didn't
ought to do such things, and offering that the neighbour, whose name
was ABDUL, should give him money to keep off and leave him alone.
But ABDUL wasn't going to stand this, so he up with, his flag, and
comes out to fight § and, by Jove, walked into him like—”
“Like what, MASTER Molesworth P” asked Grandma.
“Like a savage,” said.MASTER Molesworth. “For in an old book
which I am very fond of, called Hobbes, it says, that man's natural
state is a state of war, and I agree with that person to a certain extent.
If we are prepared to concede that the best condition of a human being
is that which is most like nature, there need be no hesitation, in going
to battle whenever we can. But wiser philanthropists hold—" -
“What, Masteh PAMMY 2’ said Grandma, observing that this
would not do.
“Their tongues,” said MASTER PAM. “I don't know what ABDUI's
friends did, but I fear they behaved like cowards and donkeys, . But
if I had been one of them, I would have said to the others, ‘Let's
stand by that plucky ABDUſ, and I would have wasted precious little
time about note-writing. I'd have sent ships to smash, his city of piles
and when the rascal came back from robbing his neighbours he shoul
have found his own house in a blaze, and what’s more, I would have
said to the people he oppressed, Here's swords and guns, go it.’
And I Wºlff have gone on, sinking his ships and burning his cities,
and hanging his thieves until he fell down in his boots and begged for
mercy, and paid all the costs, and I fancy he’d be glad to keep in his
own place for the next fifty years.” -
MASTER PAM got quite excited, and made all the others excited also,
and they began to hurray him; but he very much displeased Grandma
by his violence, and she was going to read him a severe lecture, when
the game was brought to a sudden end by the Bells dashing out into
a full chorus. So they all wished one another a happy new year, and

Protestant Irish Priests.
It appears that Protestantism is making way in Ireland, even among
the Priests themselves. At least, some of those reverend gentlemen
are protesting strenuously against the Income Tax, on account of their
incomes being derived from voluntary contributions—in that respect
precisely resembling physicians' and barristers' fees. Consistently with
this Protestant principle, they also object to the Confessional, in as far
as it involves disclosures to the Tax Commissioners.

WHY,
BOXING NIGHT AT THE PLAY.
CoME with me, and your umbrella take; }. wrapper, and your hat;
Let the latter be your Gibus—for you’ll have to fold it flat.
Come with me; for on a voyage of discovery I’m bound,
Of the sundry Christmas pieces I intend to make the round.
We have entered the theatre; oh, how free this land of ours!
Free the gallery to pelt us with some miscellaneous showers.
With the peel fresh from the orange we are greeted as we sit,
Subject to a thousand questions in the middle of the pit-
Questions of domestic comfort—questions we have heard of old—
As to the maternal mangle having recently been sold.
While these scenes are being acted by the audience around,
Qn the stage there’s something passing wrapped in mystery profound.
Actors to and fro are walking, with their º upon }. hips,
And we see that they are talking by the motion of their lips:
One who seems to be the hero rubs his hands about his hair,
And we come to the conclusion he’s a lover in despair;
Now, a lady in white muslin blows her nose with deep intent,
And we gather from the action that her father won't consent;
Now, a veteran, white-headed, paces fretfully the stage,
Surely 'tis the heavy father in a true dramatic rage-
With each sign of irritation, with each tapping of his head,
Comes a shout from British public, comes a cry of “Go to bed!”
Enters now another actor: by his most eccentric clothes,
By the corking of his eyebrows, by the painting of his nose,
By the faces that he’s making (they’re the ugliest he can),
e, with critical acumen, know him as the funny man.
Now, the hero and the lady in the muslin clear and white
With a burst of indignation from the stage take sudden flight.
Now the curtain has descended ere the opening piece is done,
And the audience is eager for the pantomimic fun.
Comes the business of the evening, comes the overture at last,
Made of airs from all composers, slow, and moderate, and fast;
Every school is represented, for ’tis usual to tack
All together, DoNizetti, BiewiTT, VERDI, BALFE and BACH.
Now again the curtain rises, and the pantomime begins,
Compº strange of noise and splendour, tricks and changes, groans
, , and grins, - - -
Kicks and cuffs, and flying women, making us with wonder stare,
At the sight of heavy mortals living—for a time-on air.
Ah! the poet from the effort of description feebly shrinks;
Ah! beneath the weight tremendous his imagination sinks;
Seeing always is believing, seeing only can explain, .
All the pantomimic wonders they’re enacting o'er again.
HIPPOCRATES AND BACCHUS.
A Society has been formed for the purpose of procuring the legis:
lative prohibition of the sale of fermented liquors, except for medicinal
purposes. Should a law to that effect be enacted, the only questiºn
will be, what purposes are, or not, medicinal; but that º will be
rather what is termed a poser. For exampié, melancholy is a disease
and if brandy-and-water is permitted to be taken in cases of mental
depression, there will be no end to keeping spirits up by pouring
§. down. A dram is a popular and efficacious remedy for a pain in
the interior, but if that is to }. allowed as an excuse for taking it, the
majority of the population will be constantly having stomachaches.
Some people may #. to settle the difficulty by referring it to medical
men, who, however, naturally, would be too º to prescribe liquor
to healthy applicants in the hope of getting them for real patients. An
English Liquor Law, treating strong drinks as drugs, would at any
rate be a boon to the medical profession. For one draught that a

im were vested the privilege of prescribing draughts of ale. One
wonders in what terms a doctor would frame his recipe for the com-
plaint that deans and chapters, for instance, are apt to be troubled with

wine, concluding with the direction, Fiat Episcopus, statim, sunendus-
let a Bishop be made, to be taken immediately. Small glasses of

THE QUACK'S DIARY.
THE following Diary has been kindly forwarded
to us by MR. Bucket of the Detectives. It
was found in the pocket of a gentleman who was
under his care for some hours:–
JANUARy-Got up, rusty, suit with black
reviver; washed and starched white choker, and
dressed for conversazione of Hahnemann Society.
Wrote circular to Duchess and other members
of Aristocracy, accompanied by, Prospectus of
Homoeopathic Sanatorium. Looked up several
East India Colonels, with constitution weakened
by warm climate. Tried it on upon others de-
bilitated in body and mind. Took apartments
in Belgravia; baited with globules and fished
for gudgeons; too many anglers already, no
bites: forced to cut my unlucky.
FEBRUARY-Signed lease of Mansion in the
country with 100 acres, Trout-stream and Cas-
cade, to open as Hydropathic establishment.
Advertised forthcoming work on “Water Cure
in Hydrophobia.” Also advertised Douche
House; advertisement got me some credit, on
which contrived to rough it on my chop and glass
of sherry.
MARCH.-Impressed strongly with necessity
of raising the wind. Landlord wanted to be off
his bargain for Douche House—had been making
inquiries about my respectability. Agreed to
cancel lease for consideration. Name of month

Gave Mesmeric séances and Consultations with
Clairvoyance, at new lodgings in May Fair.
Sacked lots of money from ladies of rank robbed

WAR-SONG FOR THE MONEY
MARKET.
LET all good folks that man disown,
Who’d basely do a Russian Loan,
To Coventry, the caſtiff, send him,
And may the Silent System end him!
Let no man traffic with a traitor
Than MitchELL or O'BRIEN greater;
Afford him either fire or fuel,
Or mix his physic or his gruel.
Let no attorney be so tender
As legal aid the wretch to render,
Although to save him from a prison,
And keep of CALCRAFT from his wizen.
If such a miscreant can be married,
May he be by a vixen harried,
A woman who in debt will run him, .
And cause her tradespeople to dun him.
His dinner be, for having sold
His country, neither hot nor cold
And by his cookmaid's constant blunder,
Either much overdone or under.
May he with aches and pains be troubled,
With crippling rheumatism doubled; .
The !...}. and the headache rack him,
And the tic-doloreux attack him.
Chaps crack the villain's hands in notches,
Break forth upon him blains and botches,
Boils, lichen, impetigo, tetter,

MAKING THE BEST OF A BAD JOB.
“Ali ' You MAY LAUGH, My Boy, BUT THERE's Nothing LIKE A Coin
BATH Toº MARE You STRoNG AND HEARTY 1" -
THE DomesTic REFoRMER ;
OR, HOW MR. PATERFAMILIAS MADE HOME HAPPY.
Sceni. 2.-MR. PATERFAMILIAs has had a Pentilating A º
the fº. kind—constructed and adapted to º: by the
distinguished practical and consulting chemist, MR. Bellows. It
consists of a pump for forcing in the earternal air, worked by the
trater-pressure got from a pipe leading from the reservoir upstairs to
the cistern in the kitchen; a warming chamber, where the air is
heated by hot-water vessels, on a plan of MR. BELIows's own; a
miring chamber, where the trarm air is cooled down to any tempera-
ture; a series of apertures in the floor and skirting-board of every
room in the house, to admit the heated air; a rentilating shaft for
drawing off the vitiated air, which communicates with all the chimneys
in the house, and to which access is given by valves near the ceilings.
Qf course the bricklayers have been in the house for a month. The
bills are left to the imagination of the reader. Open fires have been
sternly suppressed. Cºlds are prevalent in the family. But the
poisonous proceeds of human expiration are got rid of, and the
scientific principles of rentilation triumph.
Scene as before.
Mrs. P. seated, contemplatiºſ, the place where the grate used to be in a
disconsolate manner. Miss LAURA and Miss EMILY much wrapped
up, and looking blue about the nose.
. Mr. P. (reading to them from a scientific treatise). “When a person
is placed in condensed air, he breathes with increased facility; he feels
as if the capacity of his lungs was enlarged; his respirations become
deeper and less frequent; he experiences in the course of a short time
an agreeable glow in his chest-(pausing, and to his daughters) My
deas, don't you experience-
Miss Laura. A-tch-ew Atch-ew !
Mr. P. º LAURA'
Miss Laura (dolefully). Oh, Pa, I’ve such a dlead-ful cole il by

Miss Emily. A-tch-ew Ad so have I-le-ally, Papa. A-teh-ew
Mrs. P. (dismally). I’m sure, my dears, I don’t wonder at it.
Mr. P. MRs. Pater FAMILIAs, how can you encourage your daughters
in these absurd fancies? But to resume—(recommences reading) “an
eeable glow in the chest, as if the pulmonary cells were becoming
dilated, with an elastic spirit.” (Inhales.) Yes, I certainly feel the
cells dilated. (To Mrs. P.). My dear, don't you recognise in yourself
something of the kind described, since the apparatus was put up?
Mrs. P. Well, I’ve a kind of tickling in the throat; but I thought
it was influenza, my dear.
Mr. P. Influenza, MRs. P. Ridiculous!
Mrs. P. Well, I don't know, I’m sure; but ever since the house
was ventilated, º dear, I don't know how it is, but, I’m sure, I’ve
never been myself. -
Miss Laura. Oh, an’ I’m solwetchedly–A-tch-ew -
Mrs. P. (shirering). Now, there, my dear, don't you feel it?
Mr. P. What? -
* P. The draught through the floor; look how the carpet's

ii. P. That is the mixed air, admitted through the channels from
the tempering chamber by the BELLows valve.
Mrs. P. I’m sure I don’t know what it is, my dear, but my feet are
as if I was sitting in an ice-pail.
Miss Emily. And so are mile-oh º ing herself in her shawl.
Mr. P. Impossible! I mixed it myself this morning at €6°—a
healthy and agreeable medium temperature.
Mrs. P. Oh-but only put your hand down.
Mr.P. (putting his hand to the aperture). Well, I declare it does
feel chilly. There must be something wrong with the valves. I’ll
just go and look into the mixing chamber. [Erit MR PATERFAMILLAs.
Mrs. P. Oh, my dears, I always said how it would be, ever since
our papa had in that dreadful MR BELLows. I declare the room 's
ike the frozen regions; and not a bit of fire to look at-nothing but
those nasty, stuffy, hot-water pipes; and all those “bricklayers' bills,”
too; and—
Miss Laura (sniffing). Oh, mamma, what a dleadful shell-dolt you
sbell it, EBILY 2 -
Miss Emily. Oh yes, it's ollible! -
Mrs. P. So it is. I dare say your papa's been and done some-
thing to those dreadſul valves, as he calls em—(A prolonged howl heard
without). Oh, that's Newton crying! What can have happened?
º P. Really, MRs. P., that boy, Newton—it’s not to be borne:
He's been at that hot water apparatus again; and now he’s ruined
the stop-cock, and all the water’s run off, and one of the boilers has
got red-hot. It’s a mercy the house wasn't burnt down.
Mrs. P. Oh, I know it will be, some of these days. .
Mr. P. No wonder we were cold, with air coming in at 32°. But
I’ve given him a good flogging, and sent for the plumber to repair
the cock. - - -
Mrs.P. (groans). And then there’ll be more bills, my dear.
Mr. P. I beg you will not allude to bills, MRs. P. I pay them—
that is sufficient.
Mrs. P. Yes, dear—but, (sniffing) whatever can that smell be, I
wonder? -
Mr. P. (sniffin | Smell!--Ehº well really—now—I do think it's
like sulphuretted hydrogen P
Mrs. P. It’s very masty, whatever it’s like—that I know.
Mr. P. (who has been hunting the smell). And comes through the air-
channels in the º; board—it’s very odd. Eh-yes—I have it—
you know the air tubes from the mixing chamber pass under Phe, cellar
–MRs. P-depend upon it there's, a cesspool somewhere, and some
of the emanations of it have been taken up into the air-tubes.
Mrs. P. It’s enough to poison one.
Mr. P. Yes – dangerous—decidedly dangerous; what a comfort
we’ve found out its existence. We must have it looked to to-morrow.
The gardener can go to MR. BATTs, and ask him to send up a couple
of his men—my dear—to sound for the cesspool. -
Mrs. P. Oh, MR, P, more of BATTs's men! Do consider. We
haven’t had 'em out of the house a week as it is, and those bricklayers
always make a bill-al-ways.
Mr. P. Mas. P., do you expect that, as the father ºf a family, I will
consent to remain quiet with the consciousness that a cesspool is
oisoning the air I breathe-and my children? McCAN shall speak to
ATTs, I insist upon it.
Mrs. P. Oh, very well, my dear, if you insist upon it.
[A cloud of smoke is precipitated into the room from the earnt ralve
communicating with the ventilating shaft. Miss LAURA and
Miss EMILY go off in a prolonged chorus ºf sneezes and cºughs.

Mr. P. Smoke coming down! It’s contrary to the laws of nature.
It must be from the fire in the ventilating shaft. How very unaccount-

Mr. P. (sternly.) Noºyou'll entirely derange the ventilating system.

Enter SPRAggs, a boy in buttons, with an air of consternation.

“THE CRY IS STILL THEY COME l’”
HE speculators in religious
catchpennies, which, thanks
to the spirit of cant, seem
to be the most lucrative con-
cerns of the present day,
have adopted, apparently,
the old ſº cry of
“Somebody coming,” to
gain attention to their wares
and merchandise. “Some-
body coming,” or “Some-
thing .#. is the theme
of several of the new “seri-
ous” literary dodges with
which Paternoster Row is at
present inundated by those
who are looking out for the
best mode of making a mar-
ket of popular cant or po-
pular hypocrisy. The idea
first originated among the
political quacks who used
to be always talking about
the “Coming Man; ” but
it is now transferred to the
pious portion of the world
of humbug, who have been
attracted by the “Coming Struggle” to an extent that the “serious ”
booksellers have found largely conducive to their profit; ... ..
The idea is being again worked in the form of a publication called
the “Coming Crisis—not yet; ” the words “not yet ” being apparently
added to admit of future speculations in which “ The Cºming Crisis—
a little nearer,” and “The Coming Crisis—come at last,” may be
made available. We confess ourselves P. sick of the cry of
“coming” which is being perpetually raised by the pious bººk trade,
and we shall be delighted when instead of “Coming! coming!” we may
be justified in saying “Going, going, gone !”
-
Tricks of the Telegraph.
THE telegraph has been playing some odd freaks during the recent
snow storms. The wires have somehow got huddled together in such
confusion, that they have mixed up the messages and have answered
questions as to the price of stocks, with a jargon of irrelevant matter
about news from New York, the Russian question, and the last quota:
tion of Turkey in the Norfolk markets. We wish the papers had
published a selection from the cross readings of the electricte egraphs;
which might have furnished the material for a few “Nuts to Crack” at
Christmas time.
MORE FREE THAN WELCOME.
Though it is certainly no º: to be “free of the City,” it would
be undoubtedly very desirable to "get free of the Corporation” at the
earliest opportunity.
Tur LETTER of the Law.—The “Letter of the Law” must be
s. It expresses a quantity that is unknown.
MORAL FURNITURE MART.
MESSRs. GREENwooD, WARNIsh, WENEER, AND Co. have the
pleasure to inform the Nobility, Gentry, and Public in general, that, in
compliance with the prevailing taste, and under the especial patronage
of several
CLERGYMEN OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND,
they have got together an extensive assortment of Talking Tables,
Loquacious Lounging Chairs, Garrulous Sideboards, Eloquent Sofas
and other articles of Cabinet Work, peculiarly adapted to conversational
purposes.
MESSRs. G., W., W., AND Co. have taken care in the selection of their
stock to avoid those Tables and other articles of Talking Furniture
that have been detected in rapping out falsehoods, and an arrangement
has been made for keeping
A Clergyman on the Premises,
who submits every piece of furniture to a scrupulous examination
before it is exposed for sale to the customers of this establishment. It
is the constant aim of the Reverend Gentleman who superintends this
department of the Mart to test the veracity of even the most trifling
piece of goods, and thus it is impossible for any article of mendacious
mahogany to remain without discovery.
Messrs. G., W., W., AND Co. have recently added to their extensive
stock a number of
MORAL DINING-TABLES,
warranted to turn away with disgust from any vinous excess, and to
turn over their leaves, in order that the propriety of turning over a new
leaf may be suggested to some of those assembled round them. Attention
is particularly called to an extensive stock of
Talking Sideboards,
which, by the new system of Spirit Rapping, will divulge the secrets of
the cellaret, and apprise the owner of any attempts that may have
been made by servants, or others, to tamper with the wine, or to open
an unlawful communication with the spirits.
SEVERAL PAIRS OF CARD TABLES,
warranted to kick against any attempt to cheat, and to be up to all
sorts of games, so that if there should be any deception in the deal it
would at once be exposed in the mahogany or rosewood.
Among the enormous stock of Turning and Talking Furniture, may
also be enumerated a large VARIEty of WARDROBEs, some of which
will not only turn themselves, but will also turn an old coat, or other
article of dress, with the utmost neatness.
As nearly all the furniture sold at the Moral Mart is of the talking
description, it may be said to speak for itself; and anything further
that could be said for it would be quite superfluous.
THINGS NOT GENERALLY KNOWN.
THAT “Pop goes the Weasel” was composed by HANDEL.
That JoAN of ARC derived her name from being a compagnon du
“. with NoAH. - --- -
at the London synonym for “civility” is “cabrman.”
That GEORGE Fox, the Quaker, was a lineal descendant from the
celebrated GUY.
That the Commissioners of Sewers take in needlework.
That the screw-propelling principle was first applied to omnibuscs.
That a dish of whitebait consists of fried curl-papers.
That the Beef-eaters at the Tower are, without exception, strict
vegetarians.
Time out of Mind.
LAw, we are sometimes told, will shorten our days, but the law of
the County Courts seems to add to our days in a most extraordinary
manner, for according to a recent return the County Courts sat 8570
days in the last twelve months. Law proceedings will multiply figures
as far as costs are concerned, but we were not aware that .. an effect
could be produced by law on the number of days in a year, as to
turn 365 into 8570. It is certainly a long and heavy day on which we
go to law, and lº the calculation above noticed may be based on
the principle that every day, to a man engaged in litigation, is as long
as some twenty or thirty days of the ordinary duration.

SOMETHING—AT LAST-IN A NAME.
AT a recent meeting of dele-
gates in London, the secre-
§ announced that “he
had waited on MR. PRIGGBY,
an influential cabman.”
PRIGGEY may be personally
a very respectable man; but
the name, in connection with
the cab trade, is certainly
curious. There is something
rather rich in the idea of an
“influential cabman,” and
we should hardly have been
more surprised to hear of an
“eminent costermonger,” or
- a “ distinguished dustman.”
} We looked, with some
curiosity, to see the mode in
which the “influence” of
the cab fraternity can be
brought to bear on the strike,
and we find it to consist of
a “warm” offer to convey
the parties.“in a fly” to
* the most, likely places to
> obtain assistance. We only
hope that the aid of the
cab-drivers will not be em.
ployed for the º: of driving the delegates into anything absurd or mischievous,
to which they have sometimes rather too great a tendency.
STARTLING FACTS BY TELEGRAPH.
LAST week, in consequence of the snow, Liverpool was in a state of isolation
from the rest of the world, there being no traffic by rail or news by letter, and
indeed nothing by which any idea could i. formed of the doings or the condition
of the Liverpoclians. Of course indefatigable efforts were made to open the
communication with the Metropolis; but ºf . in vain, for the ordinary electric
telegraph had got into a state of entanglement through the ice and, snow, thus
affling all hopes of hearing anything from Liverpool. Bills were falling due in
London, and were being dishonoured for want of “advice; ” commercial firms
Were falling into discredit, and all for the want of communication with the north,
when at last, after almost superhuman endeavours, it was announced that the
Magnetic Telegraph had succeeded in bringing news from Liverpool. Everybody
rushed to the second edition of the morning papers to drink in the long looked for
news, when public curiosity was put in possession of the fact, that by tremendous
energy a communication had reached London, bringing the news that “Cotton
Is QUIET.”
We cannot judge of the effect of this intelligence on the commercial world, but,
to us, it seems as though, the result of the telegraphic achievements had, after
*much c ,” ended in “little wool,” though there might be a fair supply of cotton.
We had no idea that the condition of this raw material was of such vital con-
sequence as to make it paramount to every other subject of curiosity. We shall
henceforth, look out for the bulletins about cotton with unprecedented anxiet nd
interest. "If we can only be assured by the paper on our breakfast table that
“cotton has had a quict night and is better,” we shall, in future, feel a peculiar
satisfaction, a.d we should perhaps rest contented with the knowledge that
“cotton is not worse”—or worsted.
GETTING DRUNK WITH A PURPOSE.
A MoyFMENT is now on foot to put a legislative stop to all drinking of every
kind of beer or spirit, “except for medicinal purposes.” . Whether it will be
an improvement to saturate society with water instead of moistening it with
malt, is a question we leave to those who delight in dry discussion; but we must
warn the friends of total abstinence that the exception “for medicinal purposes”
is sufficient to throw the whole question overboard. We never yet knew an
old woman who could not find a “medicinal purpose” for every glass of grog she
º to have a fancy for. If an Act of Parliament should ever passed to
prohibit spirit drinking, except for medicinal purposes, it will be absolutely necessary
to add a schedule of imaginary maladies which shall be declared to be not within
the exceptions allowed by the statute. In this schedule we would comprise that
anile ailing familiarly known as the “wind,” which has caused the consumption of
more brandy and water by elderly females in one month than has been imbibed by
the most inveterate topers during an equal period. We must also guard the
legislature against the allowance of “spasms” as a ground of exception to any
measure for the prohibition of dram drinking, for there is no doubt that any
woman of a certain age can command “spasms” at any moment, when she
is desirous of calling up “spirits from the vasty deep” of the cellaret.

BAYONET AND CHISEL.
A SENTIMENTAL NARRATION.
IPAssed the Palace in the Park,
In sooth it was a weary trudge.
The snow with trampled mud was dark,
And all was slide and slush and sludge,
Wherein I greatly feared to lose
My nice new Yankee over-shoes.
1 kept at distance from the dome -
here dwells our Sovereign (when in town),
Because I thought my short way home
Was Birdcage Walk, of old renown.
But I could see (and therefore state)
Two men stood near that Palace gate.
One was the sentry—on his head
The fabled skin that warms the bear.
He ceased awhile his measured tread,
And watched the other working there.
For this, a sculptor, chiselled what
He thought adornment. I thought not.
A huge tarpaulin sound and black
Shrouded the artist like a cloak,
The sentry leant his manly back
Against his box, and thus he spoke-
At least ’twas thus to Fancy's ear;
For I was too far off to hear:-
“My fricnd, whose skilful plastic art
Creates such graces out of stone,
I feel a certain pang at heart
When thou art gone, and I’m alone,
That thou can'st do such things as these,
While I can only stand at ease.
“Mine was a country life, my friend,
Away from art and all its lore,
Until kind Fortune deigned to send
Recruiting Serjeant HENRY MOORE.
He came—I drank—I took his tee,
And am the soldier that you see.
Or envy thee thy well-earne
For that I know would not be right,
(Thanks to our pious chaplain's pains):
And warmly I appreciate
Thy work upon our Sovereign's gate.”
He ceased. His artist-friend replied—
Fancy, once more, the short-writer—
“Soldier, thou º: by my side,
Words would do honour to a mitre,
And I am proud to hear thy lip
Commend the ornaments I chip.
“Yet do not think I speak in º
gains,
“Yet do not mourn, thou gallant heart;
Our ways in two directions run—
hou in grand deeds to bear a part,
I to record them when they’re done.
And yet ’tis pleasant, friend, to feel
We’re fellow-workers with the Steel.
“And when º Bagnet, in the flank
Qf Russian slaves, has bid them flee,
This humble Chisel, friend, may clank
To bid some marble speak of thee.
And thus, though each in different way,
Are we not colleagues—Brother—say?”
Thus Fancy deemed that at their stations,
The Sculptor and the Soldier talked.
But briefer were their observations
As heard by one who nearer walked.
Soldier. “That blessed wind is Eastly.”
Artist. “Confound the day—it's Beastly.”
THE CONVERSATION of FLOWERS.
Do flowers converse? Yes, certain ; or else what is
the meaning of “Flowers of Speech?’”. Besides, we have a
standing proof of the conversation of a flower in its (s)talk!

indeed nothing by which any idea could i. formed of the doings or the condition
of the Liverpoclians. Of course indefatigable efforts were made, to open the
communication with the Metropolis; but i. in vain, for the ordinary electric
telegraph had got into a state of entanglement through the ice and snow, thus
baffling all hopes of hearing anything from Liverpool. Bills were falling due in
London, and were being dishonoured for want of “advice;” commercial firms
Were falling into discredit, and all for the want of communication with the north,
when at last, after almost superhuman endeavours, it was announced that the
Magnetic Telegraph had succeeded in bringing news from Liverpool. Everybody
rushed to the second edition of the morning papers to drink in the long looked for
news, when public curiosity was put in possession of the fact, that by tremendous
energy a communication had reached London, bringing the news that “Cotton
Is QUIET.”
We cannot judge of the effect of this intelligence on the commercial world, but,
to us, it seems as though, the result of the telegraphic achievements had, after
much cry,” ended in “little wool,” though there might be a fair supply of cotton.
We had no idea that the condition of this raw material was of such vital con-
sequence as to make it paramount to every other subject of curiosity. We shall
henceforth, look out for the bulletins about cotton with unprecedented anxiet nd
interest. "If we can only be assured by the paper, on our breakfast table that
“cotton has had a quiet night and is better,” we shall, in future, feel a peculiar
satisfaction, ald we should perhaps rest contented with the knowledge that
“cotton is not worse”—or worsted.
GETTING DRUNK WITH A PURPOSE.
.A. MoyFMENT is now on foot to }. a legislative stop to all drinking of every
kind of beer or spirit, “except for medicinal purposes.”. Whether it will be
an improvement to saturate society with water instead of moistening it with
malt, is a question we leave to those who delight in dry discussion; but we must
warn the friends of total abstinence that the exception “for medicinal purposes”
is sufficient to throw the whole question overboard. We never yet knew an
old woman who could not find a “medicinal purpose” for every glass of grog she
happened to have a fancy for. If an Act of Parliament should ever be passed to
rohibit spirit drinking, except for medicinal purposes, it will be absolutely necessary
o add a schedule of imaginary maladies which shalf be declared to be not within
the exceptions allowed by the statute. In this schedule we would comprise that
anile j familiarly known as the “wind,” which has caused the consumption of
more brandy and water by elderly females in one month than has been imbibed by
the most inveterate topers during an equal period. We must also guard the
legislature against the allowance of “spasms” as a ground of exception to any
measure for the prohibition of dram drinking, for there is no doubt that any
woman of a certain age can command “spasms”. at any moment, when she
is desirous of calling up “spirits from the vasty deep” of the cellaret.
BAYONET AND CHISEL,
A SENTIMENTAL narrat ION.
IPAssED the Palace in the Park,
In sooth it was a weary trudge.
The snow with trampled mud was dark,
And all was slide and slush and sludge,
Wherein I greatly feared to lose
My nice new Yankee over-shoes.
l º at distance from the dome -
here dwells our Sovereign (when in town),
Because I thought my short way home
Was Birdcage Walk, of old renown.
But I could see (and therefore state)
Two men stood near that Palace gate.
One was the sentry—on his head
The fabled skin that warms the bear.
He ceased awhile his measured tread,
And watched the other working there.
For this, a sculptor, chiselled what
He thought adornment. I thought not.
A huge tarpaulin sound and black
Shrouded the artist like a cloak,
The sentry leant his manly back
Against his box, and thus he spoke-
At least ’twas thus to Fancy's ear;
For I was too far off to hear:-
“My fricnd, whose skilful plastic art
Creates such graces out of stone,
I feel a certain pang at heart
When thou art gone, and I’m alone,
That thou can'st do such things as these,
While I can only stand at ease.
“Mine was a country life, my friend,
Away from art and all its lore,
Until kind Fortune deigned to send
Recruiting Serjeant HENRY MooRE.
He came—I'drank—I took his tee,
And am the soldier that you see.
“Yet do not think I speak in †.
Or envy thee thy well-earned gains,
For that I know would not be right,
(Thanks to our pious chaplain's pains):
And warmly I appreciate
Thy work upon our Sovereign's gate.”
He ceased. His artist-friend replied—
Fancy, once more, the short-writer—
“Soldier, thou º: by my side,
Words would do honour to a mitre,
And I am proud to hearthy lip
Commend the ornaments I chip.
“Yet do not mourn, thou gallant heart;
Our ways in two directions run—
Thou in grand deeds to bear a part,
I to record them when they’re done.
And yet ’tis pleasant, friend, to feel
We’re fellow-workers with the Steel.
“And when thy Bagnet, in the flank
Qf Russian slaves, has bid them flee,
This humble Chisel, friend, may clank
To bid some marble speak of thee.
And thus, though each in different way,
Are we not colleagues—Brother—say?”
Thus Fancy deemed that at their stations,
The Sculptor and the Soldier talked.
But briefer were their observations
As heard by one who nearer walked.
Soldier. “That blessed wind is Eastly.”
Artist. “Confound the day—it's Beastly.”
THE CONVERSATION of FLOWERs.

the meaning of “Flowers of Speech?” Besides, we have a

A COUNTY COURT RHADAMANTHUS.
EOPLE are all agreed
that the man who would
lay his hand upon a
woman otherwise than
in the way of kindness
is a villain, and that
mal-treatinent of th:
gentler sex ought to
be a jºi
but we shall also most y
agree that a moderate
punishment would have
amply satisfied the ends
of justice, and the in-
terests of society, in a
case of out upon a
lady describable in the
following terms:
“The offence complained of
was ºf the mildest character,
Tukwks being accused of
merely holding up his fists
in a threatening Inanner tº-
wards the couplainant over
the shoulder of a man who
stood before her."
Such is the statement
of the County Courts'
Chronicle—a paper of which the contents are generally creditable to that, Bench whose
'udgments it records; but which in the present instance relates the fact that, the above-
mentioned TURNER, for * flourishing his fists at a Miss BLAckstone, behind some-
body else, was sentenced § MR. J. B. PARRy, Q.C., the Judge of the Beikshire County
Court “to £50 damages with full costs and immediate execution.” Why?
“The lady admitted at the trial that she was not even alarmed by the conduct of the defendant."
Everybody will suppose that the reason why damages of so swinging a character were
inflicted on TURNER was, that MR. TuRNER was a millionaire to whom fifty pounds were
as five shillings are to persons in average circumstances. Were the case so it would reflect
t credit on the ... wisdom of MR. J. B. PARRY, Q.C.. It would be a practical
esson in the science of fining, and might lead to an improvement in the system which levies
the same penalty for the same offence on a drayman and a duke. But no. The defendant
is described as
“Thomas TURNER, a labouring Inan, with a family of young children, and who is also town-crier."
We are further informed that TURNER's goods were taken under the legal process shortly
after the judgment, but were insufficient to pay the costs; and that
“At a subsequent court the Judge, after inquiring into TURNER's means, ordered that the damages and costs
should be discharged by monthly instalments of 6s, thus in effect alienating a considerable portion of his weekly
earnings for seventeen years prospectively, or subjecting him, in default of payment, to repeated monthly
imprisonments during the whole of his future life, a process which, so far from cancelling the debt, would
materially increase its amount by the addition of the heavy fees of the cout upon every fresh imprisonment.
The sum now due from this poor man amounts to £68.”
The foregoing facts were stated in a deputation that waited on LoRD PALMERSTON with
a memorial signed by the leading inhabitants and the clergy of the borough, praying the
noble lord for inquiry into MR. PARRY's decision. The York of WALLINGroRD, who
headed the deputation, also called the attention of the Home SECRETARY to the facts that
there was discrepancy in the evidence on which the conviction was based; that TURNER,
being unable to pay the first instalment of 61, increased by costs to £2 1s. 5d., had been
committed to Abingdon Gaol for thirty days; and that his family are now dependent for
support on the Union funds. -
- RD PALMERSTON-who has generally a proper answer for everybody—promised to look
into the matter. In the meantime it may be suggested that some power of appeal should
exist from County Court judgments, seeing they may possibly be º JUDGE JEFFERIES

extend to judgment on civil process; and jer—that is, PARRY acted strictly within
his jurisdiction by mulcting TURNER to the uttermost farthing that he is empowered to
Impose.

STANZAS FOR THE SENTIMENTAL.
On a Tear which ANGELINA observed Trickling down my Nose

Whence flowed that sudden tear:
The truth 'twere kindness to conceal
From thy too anxious ear.
How often when some hidden spring
Of recollected grief -- - -
Is rudely touched, a tear will bring
The bursting breast relief!
Yet 'twas no anguish of the soul,
No memory of woes,
Bade that one lonely tearlet roll
Adown my chiselled nose:
But, ah! interrogation's note
Still twinkles in thine eye;
Know then that I have burnt my throat
With this confounded pie
Why be Ill P
THIs question has been § to the world by
DR. Forbes WINslow in the last number of his
; and from the answer he gives to it, we
earn the fact that many of us are ill simply
because we are ill-disposed; or, in other words,
that, any one who wishes to make himself an
invalid, finds a valid excuse for doing so. The
doctor quotes BURTON, who, talks of a priest
that “could separate himself from his senses
when he list,” an acnievement not very uncom-
mon among the priesthood of the present day,
for we find many of the clerical profession who
take leave of their senses with the utmost ease,
as the Reverend Table-talkers can testify.

MORE EFFECTS OF THE SNOW-STORM
(From our Own Penny-a-Liner.)
We have several important additions to make to the list of casualties
and inconveniences occasioned by the great snow-storm.
.The EARL or ABEEDEEN was about to take some steps in the right
direction, but, from the slippery state of the streets, his lordship was
compelled to stay at home, and content himself with writing a kind
note to the Russian Embassy.
MR. CoBDEN, MR. BRIGHT, and the other leading peacemongers, were
about to convene a meeting, at which they intended to j: them:
selves to attempt, in the case of Turkey and Russia, the “arbitration”
and “pacific interference” which they have advocated in so many tons
of tracts. But the snow rendered it impossible for them to show that
their advocacy had ever been in earnest.
RD GUILDFORD intended to have paid into Court several thousand
pounds of income improperly received by himself, but the snow was so
thick that his lordship's carriage could not get to his banker's.
The General, Post Office designed to have delivered the morning
post letters in the City at least five minutes before the evening mails
went out, but this time the snow afforded a really good excuse for a
dº which is now habitual. -

he had promised, to his tailor's, to pay a portion of the bill which has
been running for three years, but the snow hindered him from walking
and there were no cabs to be had; so, much to his annoyance, he was
obliged to abstain from going, and to spend the money in giving a
little.square dinner at IIMMER's. He has been so much ºi.
the circumstance that he has been unable to see the tailor since.
The Nelson Column people had fully made up their minds to go to
Charing Cross and have another look at the vacant face of the pedestal,
and consider whether some of these days something might not be done
towards seeing about the suggesting the completion of the work, but the
snºw caused the postponement of these active measures until next year.
The Gas Directors actually did meet, and agree that it ...i. a
very sad thing if they had to cut off the gas and leave London in total
darkness. And then they went home, the snow, we suppose, preventing
the Directors from directing that a large, bright, oil 5. should be
provided for each gas-post, so that we might be at least no worse off
than our fathers.
MR. FREng Rick BloBBs, of Camberwell, had proposed to take his
wife and children to see a pantomime, but on account of the snow he
was compelled to leave them at home and go by himself, the state of
the streets also sending him round by a certain tavern near the Hay-
market, and preventing his getting to Camberwell until four in the
morning.

UNSEASONABLE DISCUSSION
A PAINFUL discussion has lately been going on in the newspapers,
We allude to the Kilt controversy. The bare allusion—as we will
venture to say—is calculated under existing circumstances to inflict
pain on any mind of common sensibility. ... With the thermometer at
zero, the snow on the ground, the sea-gulls up inland, the skaters on
the Serpentine, and the Thames nearly frozen over, the very mention
of a kilt is enough to give anybody a cold. How could the cruel Scotch-
men think of raising such a question in this bitter weather! The debat
indeed, in the dog-days, would have been agreeably, cooling an
refreshing, and it ought in mercy to have been .. to this time

: He stayed not for speech, but,

He found certain reasons which
urged him to wait.
For down by the Danube stood
OMAR PASHA, -
Prepared to encounter our big-
booted Czar.
vassal, and thrall,
So he drew up his legions—serf
His footmen, and horsemen, and cannons and all,
Then out spake bold OMAR, his hand on his sword,
In an attitude fitting an Ottoman Lord,
“O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,
Or to see St. SöPHIA, you big-booted Czar * *
“I’ve long asked your homage, my suit 3. denied,
And my holy religion you’ve scorned and decried,
So now I’ve come down with this army of mine,
The rights and the wrongs of the case to define,
And you have not a chance, for the Mussulman star
Must pale when it looks on the flag of the Czar.”
He º down his challenge, the Turk took it up,
(Remarking on slips 'twixt the lip and the cup)
And deigned to his logic the briefest reply, -
“That the claim was unjust, and its proof was a lie,”
And he brought up some thousands of swords as a bar
To further advance by the big-booted Czar.
So before Oltenitza the battle took place,
And the Russian thought }. er to right about face,
For the guns of Stamboul ºa menacing boom,
And a bombshell sent flying the DANNENBURG plume,
And the Cossacks all grumbled, “”T were better by far,
To eat tallow at home than dine out with the Czar.”
One hint would not do, nor one word in his ear.
The despot commands, and his men persevere-
So again to the breezes their standards are flung,
And Kalafat echoes the war-trumpet .
And the Ottoman, charging, has scattere aſar
The ill-fated troops of the big-booted Czar.
There was wild disarray in the rear and the van,
The Moslem they rode, and the Cossacks they ran.
There was racing and chasing—’twas pleasing to see
The Russ as well beat as a Russian can be.
May this, and much worse, be all fortune of war
That awaits the old pirate, the big-booted Czar.
THE ORTHODOXOMETER OR THEOLOGOSCOPE.
“ENLIGHTENED PUNCH, Clapham Athenaeum.
- “You, and all who share your benevolent disposition, will be
delighted to learn that I have discovered a very simple but effectual
contriyance for the settlement of all religious disputes now º Or
hereafter to be raised. . A clergyman in this neighbourhood (whose
name I suppress, out of consideration for his modesty, and at his own
urgent request), having discovered that the rotation of tables which
has attracted so much attention lately is entirely produced by a demo-
niacal possession of the said tables, and having further ascertained that
they are quite unable to revolve if any pious book be laid upon them,
though its bulk be ever so trifling; but that they will curvet, caracole,
and oscillate under any weight of profane or heterodox literature, first
furnished me with the idea of the Qrthodoxometer or Theologoscope.
My method of using the instrument is very simple. I take a table of
any wood (though the Dodonese oak is best suited to the purpose)
and either of homely or fashionable make, for one great merit of the
invention is that, as one table is quite as fully possessed as another,
the Orthodoxometer is within the reach of the highest and the lowest
in the land, of the Speaker of the House of Commons, and of the
meanest professor, of the pea and thimble. Having placed on my
table the book, or books, whose orthodoxy or moral fitness is called in
question, I cause a number of practised table-movers to place themselves
en rapport with the table, in the usual fashion, and P invariably find
that the number and rapidity of the oscillations, or revolutions, is in
a direct ratio to the amount of objectionable matter contained in the
books. I have thrown the results of my last experiment into a tabular
É. as being the one best suited to the subject, and I now submit
them:-

“Having ascertained the correctness of these data by repeated
.."; I caused the Acta Sanctorum, in one hundredſ folio
volumes, kindly lent to me by MR., PANIzzi, to be brought up from
the van in which they had travelled from the British Museum, and
piled upon the table. The consequences were fearful. No sooner
were the operators, en rapport with the table, than the whole mass,
after º: round for some minutes with a gradually increasing
rapidity, broke into a series of the most violent bounds, and plunges
stretched four of the operators on the floor, and finally floundere
through a party-wall into the next house, to the infinite alarm of the
occupant, an old lady, who was in the quiet enjoyment of her tea, and
Bell’s Weekly Messenger. . This last decisive experiment will convince
you of the great merit of a discovery which will unquestionably put
an end to much heart-burning and strife, since rival theologians need
hereafter do no more than submit their works to the critical opinion
of the writing table on which, they have committed them to paper
instead of waiting for the equally certain but more remote verdict o
posterity. In proof of the extreme accuracy and delicacy of my table's
perceptions, I may state, that when the first edition of ‘DRELINcourt
on Death’ was placed on it, it preserved its wonted tranquillity, but
that, under the second edition, which contains DEFQE's lying account
of MRs. WEAL's apparition, it gambolled in a playful and quite jocular
way. Its sense of propriety is also very, nice, for when a single
number of Punch was placed on it, our united volitions could not move
it; but it revolved rapidly under some cwt. of the daily and weekly
papers, until we had cut out some trials and a quantity of advertise-
ments, when it appeared satisfied and became stationary. I am having
a largetable constructed, to be ready against the May Mºtiº. in order

orator and his audience, since, so long as it is stationary, the one will
know that he is uttering, and the others will be sure that they are
hearing, nothing objectionable. Should my invention come into general

CANNON BALL-ROOM MUSIC.
WHAT a knack have the composers of fashionable dance-music of
turning all things “to favour and to prettiness!”. The attention of
our readers may have been arrested by a lithograph in the music-shop
windows, representing a cannon with the Russian standard leaning
against it on one side, and the Turkish on the other, crossed saltier:
wise; a pyramid of round shot underneath it, and in the back-ground
smoke, amid which cavalry are skirmishing. This pretty picture con-
stitutes the exterior of a musical publication, denominated the “War
Galop.” We have not, so far as we know, had the advantage of hearing
this composition, and therefore we cannot say that it has not a high
purpose. Perhaps it is calculated to excite reflection whilst it inspires
gaiety, and to appeal to the heart as well as to move the heels.
“Amid the joy and the uproar” of the ball-room, it may tend to
awaken pity and compassion for the sufferers by shot shell, sabre,
lange, and the other implements of destruction by which the ENEMy
or MAN and the EMPERoR of Russia, are permitted to wreak their
malice on the human race, Chords and movements, imitative of the
groans of the wounded and dying, peradventure mingle with the lighter
measure, which is tripped in the blaze of drawing-room glory by ele-
gantly dressed persons of both sexes. -
The “War Galop,” possibly, illustrates the real thing so called, and
spelt with two 1's, as actually performed on the field of battle over the
backs and stomachs and fractured limbs and faces of unfortunate
crippled soldiers. It may serve to warn young ladies what frail things
are the limbs and features of handsome officers, polk they never so
charmingly. If so, let due credit be given to the composer of the
“War §º one D'ALBERT-or ALBERT-and, we hope ALBERT
will limit himself to the inoffensive means of music in advocating a

It's a Way they have in the City.
At one of the Mansion House dinners lately, after loud cries had
been raised for the º of the different Lords and Bishops, and
equally loud responses had been given when their turn came to obstruct
the thoroughfare, a young man amused himself by bawling out, at the
top of his voice, “TEMPLE BAR IN FLEET STREET stops the way !”
NAKED simplicity.
A “TRUE High LANDER” writes to express his indignant, surprise
that any possible objection can be taken to the Highland costume, as
affording insufficient winter clothing. He “wadlike to see the chiel,”
he says, “wha'd show him a warmer covering than bare skin.”

Mrs. P. (laying down the newspaper). Coals up again; forty-three
shillings aton!. It’s awful! And our winter stock not laid in yet.
Mr. P. That’s lucky.
Mrs. P. º mydear?
ºf: Yes; because I have determined on dispensing with coals
altogether.
iß. P. Do without coals, MR.P.” Why you might just as well
think of doing without candles.
Mr. P..I trust very soon to be able to abolish in my house that most
costly and unscientific mode of illumination, Mrs. P.
Mrs. P. Good gracious! Well, it’s, bad enough to be without a
cheerful coal-fire; but if we’re to live in the dark, one might as well
be an Esquimaux at once.
Mr.P. Why will you always rush to conclusions, MRs. P., in that
mostillogical manner: Isay, Itrust to be able to dispense with coals
and candles, not with light and heat. Ón the contrary, both are most
essential to the healthy development of the human animal.
Mrs. P. Well, my dear, I’m sure I could never get on without them,
ºf from cold feet as I do.
Mr. P. My intention, MRs. P., is to have gas laid all over the house.
Mrs. P. Oh, my dear, you know what happened at the SIMRIsses,
when they had it. Pray do consider–
Mr.P. My determination is the result of much and anxious con-
sideration, MRs. P. . - -
Mrs. P. You know it got into their store-closet and blew up the boy.
And then there's DR.I.ETHEby's evidence—he's a scientific man, you
know. It was in the Times last week all about the ammonia getting
into the ground, and causing dreadful smells, and pilof vitrioldestroying
French polish, and books, and I don't know all what—
Mr. P. I have no doubt DR. LETHEBy’s conclusions are sound. He
is a man Imuch respect. , We owe to him the detection of many of
the poisons which we habitually eat, and drink, and breathe. But I
intend my gas to be purified. Mr. BELLows has invented an admirable
apparatus for the purpose.
rs. P. Oh, but remember his ventilating contrivance, my dear—
what a nuisance that turned out—and the expense too.
. Mr. P. (waving his hand dictatorially.) Enough, MRs. P. Expense
is no argument with me, when there is a sound principle to be asserted
and an example to be set to my fellow-men. (Looking out of the window.)
Here’s the gas-fitter with the estimate I asked for.

Socket. Good morning, Mum. Yes, Sir-that is, arough eye estimate,

Mrs. P. But the expense, MR. Socket?
Socket. Oh, bless you, Mum—nothing to speak of—nothing.
Mrs. P. Yes, but how much?
Socket (reluctantly). There'll be the pipe from the main down the
front garden for the 'all lamp, say forty-two foot half-inch iron-welded
tubing at sixpence, and there'll be the 'all lamp—that’s according to
fancy, you know. Then the double-cone burner and moon-holder—I
put 'em in at five shillings, though there's many charges five-and-six;
and, let's see, you’ve twelve rooms including dining and drawrin-
rooms—them's centre chandeliers in course-suppose we reckon
twenty-four argun, at from 38 to 3s.6d.; and you'll want—let's see—

but that’s not }. Socket's plan, as you know, Sir.
Mrs. P. (overwhelmed by the total). £30 or £35 !
Mr. P. But think of the saving! Perhaps you are not aware,
Mrs. P., that a valuable little practical work, “Hinº to Gas Con.
sumers,” makes out that “five cubic, feet ºf purified coal-gas, con-
sumed in a 15 hole argand burner, yields a light equal to 12 candles
during one hour, and its cost is six-tenths of a penny!”

LONDONDERRY AND LINDLEY MURRAY.
URELY LORD CHESTRRFIELD is not
the only nobleman whose name
will go down to posterity at the
foot of his letters. There is ano-
ther noble Lord whose epistles to
his tenants are as remarkable as
those which the first named Peer
addressed to his son. Here is one
of them: but such is its profundity
that it must be analyzed in order
to be understood, and requires to
be presented to the intellect by
pieces at a time:–
“The MARQUIs or LoNDonDRRRy, on
leaving Ireland for the present, is grateful
to be able to announce to his tenantry the
pleasure he receives from the reports of
the office.”
What office? A Government
Office P A Police Office P A
Lawyer's Office? The Office of
the UIs of LoNDONDERRY,
is that the Office? and does the noble Lord keep an office P and if so,
how many clerks does he keep, and at what salaries? However, from
# º of the office, whatever it is, concerning his tenantry, he has
earne
“That they are reducing, by every effort, the large amount of arrears on the estate."
What estate? Perhaps that was specified in the original document;
in the copy of it, which we quote, the only estate mentioned is Ireland
at large, on leaving which country LoRD LONDONDERRY says that he
is grateful-meaning, perhaps, gratified—to be able to announce, to his
tenantry the pleasure he receives from the reports of an indefinite
office, that they are reducing the large amount of arrears on this estate.
LoRI, LoNDoNDERRY, at this rate, beats LoRD BATEMAN. Half of
the single county of Northumberland only formed the estate of that
Hoble Lord, but the whole of Ireland appears to belong to LoRD
LoNDONDERRY. Be this as it may :-
“He believes, and hopes, his last counsel to them has neither been impolitic on his
part, nor injudicious to the interests—"
“To" for “in respect to”—we presume—the interests
“Of the farmers on that very large and improving property.”
Ireland, happily, has at length become an improving property, and
it certainly is a very large one. It surely must be the estate which the
noble Marquis alludes to. Did any one ever know, that he was so
#. proprietor? He proceeds to say—addressing the tenantry
or treland-
“And he again calls upon them by every sense of honesty and duty, and that happy
bond of loyal attachment and affection so long established and prevailing between his
family and themselves, to persevere and continue to struggle and liquidate their rents
due and their just and long standing obligations to him; and he assures them now
that when their conduct is directed and restored to a proper reliance on their
landlord, instead of being misled and deceived by others, they may entirely rely on an
oblivion of the past, and a return of that indulgence, consideration, and paternal
interest he has always been most anxious, as their friend and counsellor, to show them.
* December 17." “WANH Londondrahy.”
The pathos of the conjuration of his tenantry, “by every sense,” &c.,
“to persevere and continue to struggle,” &c., is exquisite, and there
is great art in that employment of the appropriate language of distrac-
tion which immediately follows, and which represents their conduct as
directed and restored to a proper reliance on their landlord, instead of
being misled and deceived by, others. In the same fine strain, of
bewildered emotion he assures them that they may rely on an oblivion
of the past, whereas he has before mentioned a happy bond of loyal
attachment and affection as having long prevailed between his º
themselves, and, proceeds to promise a return of that induſ.
gence, &c., which he has always been most anxious to show them, and
of which the return would seem to be the return of the past rather
than its oblivion. -
If the MARQUIs or LoNDONDERRY is of a truth the landlord of all
Ireland, he has indeed land and beeves. Overstocked with the latter,
he disposes of his bulls in his letters.

(Affectionately Dedicated to PATERFAMILIAs, whoever he may be.)
AN AUTOCRAT CARVED IN EBONY.
PLUTARCH-had he been now extant-might have been supplied º
PRESIDENT ROBERTs, of Liberia, with a good case for a parallel.
The following, statement, respecting a neighbouring sable potentate
was made by the dark President in a Message to his ebony, senate and
sooty. House of Representatives. , Having related that the ruler, in
question, by name GeoRGE CANE, had failed in his promises, invaded
a contiguous territory, and was meditating mischief, he said—
“With GEongn CANE war seems to be a ruling passion. No persuasion, I fear, will
restrain him from shedding the blood of his defenceless brethren. But that he must be
checked, gentlemen, is certain. Common safety requires it—justice and humanity
demand it—and these claims are not to be resisted. If, therefore, it shall be established
that George CANE is still carrying on his predatory wars, some measure should be
speedily adopted to restrain him.",
Every word, that PRESIDENT ROBERTs uttered respecting GEORGE
CANE is equally applicable to another chief of savages more numerous,
and of a different complexion from GeoRGE CANE's. One chief, to be
sure, is black, and the other is white; but if the former has a black
skin, the latter has a blacker heart, and is a worse blackguard. It
may be surmised that GEORGE CANE is a nickname, indicating that the
monarch so called, is accustomed to beat his subjects, precisely as his
hº fellow might be denominated Nicholas KNoüT.
t is much to be wished that LoRD ABERDEEN had, some time since,
spoken out as much to the purpose about Nicholas Knout as Presſ.
DENT ROBERTs spoke concerning GEORGE CANE.

A KINDLY person writing to the Times, under the signature of

“If the affectionate pair will get two copies of some particular English dictionary

ginning in the middle, &c.), and, adopting signs for the varieties of inflection, use
the numbers for the words, they may publish their turtle doveries in perfect safety, as
nº calculation of alphabetical chances could avail against them.”
Love sometimes sharpens the intellectual faculties, and may there-
fore, in certain cases, cnable its victims to understand the foregoing
complicated directions. But more generally the tender passion disturbs
the mind; and it is doubtful whether many young persons, actuated
º mutual affection, would be able to make either head or tail

GREAT FALL OF CHRISTMAS BILLS
Most frightful fall,
one of the greatest
that has been known
for many years, visi-
ted the Metropolis
and other parts of the
country, on the first of
the presentmonth, and
continued throughout
the week with more
or less severity. The
fall was composed of
an almost incessant
shower of Christmas
Bills, which contin-
ued to pour, into al-
most every house in
every ... thoroughfare.
The bills that fell in
some places were so
extremely heavy and
numerous, as to form
almost an avalanche,
and preclude all hope
of liquidation under
a very lengthened
period. In some in-
stances the bills fell
with such rapidity, as
to keep the dooralmost
constantly open, and
it was quite unsafe
for the inmate to
venture to the door, lest the bills—some of which were of tremendºus |h
size—should be thrown into his face with an alarming impetus. The
# hope of "...i -
endeavour to raise the wind inside the house; but this attempt was
successful in only a very few instances. So penetrating was the fall
that the bills found their way through the letter-boxes, down the areas,
and even under the doors, when the inmates, knowing what to .
had kept the doors of their houses closed against the approaching
enemy. We heard of several instances in which persons were, foun
completely over head and ears, from the quantity of bills that had come
in upon §. In some cases the inundation was so extensive that
the parties were unable to leave their abodes, in consequence of the
thoroughfares in the neiglbourhood of their houses being rendered
impassable by the bills that poured in from them. -
We have heard it rumoured that, should the inconvenience continue,
it is the intention of a number of benevolent Fº to form them-
selves into a society for clearing off the bills of those who, though they
cannot be said to be “snowed up,” are, undoubtedly, “hard up,” owing
to the position in which they are placed by the cause to which we
have alluded. The activity shown by the boys in offering their services
to clear away the snow might be imitated with advantage by the
affluent, who would present a most pleasing spectacle, if they could be
seen going round with purses, instead of brooms, in their hands, and
addressing the inquiry, “Want your bills cleared?” to the poor
unhappy victims of the Christmas inundation. -
... We have heard of some parts of the world in which the “falling
dew", has had a fearful effect on the inhabitants; but we never, wit-
nessed anything to equal the effect of the “falling due” of the Christmas
bills, in throwing a damp on the spirits at the season of festivity.

JUDICIAL JESTING.
CCUSTOMED as we are to
such matters, we have
not often noticed a finer
instance of the transition
from “grave to gay”
than was exhibited the
other day by the Deputy
Assistant Judge at the
Middlesex Sessions. The
Jury had just found a
prisoner guilty, when
“Mr. Witham thought it a
serious case.
“The constable remarked
that the offence committed by
the prisoner was called ‘putting
the mug on.'
“Mr. Witham.–Indeed 1
Then I shall put the mug on
him, and sentence him to penal
servitude for four years.”
The Deputy Assistant
Judge commenced by
calling attention to the
“seriousness” of the
case, and then, taking a
cue from a constable, pro-
ceeded to indulge in a
jocose remark beforesentencing a prisoner to four years penal servitude. “I shall
§: the mug on him,” was the elegantly witty observation of the judicial functionary;
ut whether the learned gentleman suited the action to the word by, literally
“pulling a mug,” as the slang phrase goes, at the unfortunate prisoner, the report
does not enlighten us.
A PILGRIMAGE TO RUSSIA.
We have read of arduous pilgrimages, undertaken in the enthusiasm of faith,
This would be just the season—both in the primary and secondary sense of the word
—for such a display of earnestness on the part of the Peace Society. Now that
the weather is so cold, and the times are so hot, what could be more suitable in
every way to existing circumstances, than a deputation from that pacific association
to bear the olive branch to the EMPERoR of Russia?
Do not those gentlemen and ladies see how much wiser would be the course of
offering Nicholas the Pipe of Peace, than that of sending a fleet into the Euxine
and bidding him put that in his pipe—and smoke it? -
The procession of peacemakers might approach the throne of the Autocrat in
characteristic drab–as good as with º are to the knout; Mr. BRight might
precede, performing on the dulcimer; MR. Cobb EN might follow plºying a violin,
and the rest of the delegates might come after, making music with “flutes and soft
reeorders,” cornets à pistons, and all otherinstruments of harmony—which, of
course, would be exclusive of drums and fifes. - -
Music “drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek.” Might it not even elicit some
drops of pity from the §: of Nighor:As? It hath charms to move the savage
reast—or beast. Possibly it could mollify the heart of the Russian Bear.
ANSWERS TO CONUNDRUMS.
We are sorry to say we have mislaid the questions to the following.
we print the answers, as, we consider them far too good to be lost.

1. Because it's Candle-house (scandalous).
2. Because the one axes his way, and the other weighs his axe.
3. An Alley-gaitor (alligator), and a Gutter Percher, (gutta percha).
4. The difference is this—in the first place the roll is mustered, and in the
second the mustard is rolled. .
5. When it's a-niche-in (an itching) of BURNs.

't & * waxy-natur (vaccinator), and MURPHY's Tête-à-Téte-or ('tatur-

8. The one's Civil, and the other Militia is (malicious).
9. Because formerly it was Nile (nihil), but now it is Summut of Mont Blanc.
10. Beeause he's made an impression with sealing-wax (ceiling-whacks),
ll. The reason why St. Martin's Lane is so full of dentists ". they know
well enough that their customers would never come to them unless they were first
driven by a Long Acher (Acre), . - - - -

WRITTEN ON THE FIRST DAY OF TERM.
SoMEWIIAt back of the Abbey wall
Stands the ancient Westminster Hall;
Across its pavement to and fro
Gaunt barristers their shadows throw,
And from its station in the Hall,
A voice seems muttering to all–
“Plaintiff—Defendant;
Defendant—Plaintiff.”
Half-way down the Hall there stands
An usher, beckoning with his hands;
'Neath the roof of massive oak
Stands this usher wrapped in his cloak,
With voice sarcastic to all who pass,
Saying, “Whichever he is, he's an ass–
Plaintiff-Defendant;
Defendant—Plaintiff.”
By day, his voice is low and light;
But, in the silent dead of night,
A ghostly whisper seems to fall
In echoes along the vacant Hall,
Along the ceiling—along the floor,
And seems to say at each court-house door—
“Plaintiff—Defendant
Defendant—Plaintiff' "
Through days of Term, in November dank;
Through days of Hilary, sittings in banc.;
ºf. every time of legal change,
E’en through the long vacation's range,
As if't were the demon of strife and law,
The voice repeats those words of awe-
“Plaintiff—Defendant!
l)efendant–Plaintiff' "
In that Hall there used to be
Banquets and hospitality,
When Coronation cannons roared,
Nobles feasted at its board;
But, like the skeletons at the feast,
The usher's echo never ceased—
“Plaintiff–I)efendant
Defendant–Plaintiff!”
There groups of lawyers’ clerks have played,
There [. ess barristers have º
O, brieflessness! thou time of ease,
Of conscience free from ill-got fees,
Of pocket unoppressed by gold
From clients negligently sold.
“Plaintiffs—Defendants!
Defendants—Plaintiffs 1”
In that Court there sits, in black,
The occupant of the Woollen Sack;
There, on a cushioned bench below,
The officers sit in a dismal row;
And through the door, upon the stair,
Stand like the pictures of despair-
“Plaintiff-Defendant!
Defendant—Plaintiff l’”
All are scattered now, and fled;
Suitors are married—suitors are dead!
Some are grown deaf, and some are blind;
Some are for costs in prison confined:
And if you ask the reason why,
The Šid Hall's echo makes reply—
“Plaintiff-Defendant!
Defendant–Plaintiff l’”
Plaintiff here—defendant there;
Nothing for both but constant care :
And death and life their course shall run,
Before the Chancery Suit is done.
The dirge of Law and Equity
Peals for both incessantly-
“Plaintiff—Defendant
Defendant—Plaintiff l’”

AN. UNGRATEFUL SUBJECT.
THERE is actually such a journal as the Dumfries Courier.
Our old friend is not a myth but a newspaper. A gentle-
man, MR. WILLIAM R. M'DIARMID, has actually written a
letter to the Times dated from the Courier Qſice, Dumfries.
In this communication MR. M'DIARMID strongly advocates
the warming of houses by hot water. There are so many

hot water º be said to be already very general. ii.
the peace of families would, in one respect, be materially

children can play with the fire, and by that means burn
their fingers; so that the º amount of screaming which
arises from that cause would be prevented. Persons about
to marry would be saved considerable expense in fire-irons
and fenders, and persons who have married, the hire of
charwomen for the scrubbing and cleaning necessitated by
dust and smoke, and the cost of the dresses and furniture
spoilt by them. Those sweeping measures which it is
necessary—under, a double penalty, that of fine and of fire
—to institute with reference to chimneys, would be in

diminished expenditure. That the substitution, however,
of the hot water pipe for the grate would increase the
comfort of the domestic hearth can hardly be said, as the
hearth would be abolished; and the good old Christmas
custom of gathering round the fire and telling ghost stories,
could hardly be maintained in the absence of anything to
gather round but a heated cylinder.

QNE of our “Railway Libraries,” we observe, begins its series with an
“Essay on the Guillotine.”. We shall not stop to question if a subject
such as this be exactly fitted to beguile the tedium of a journey. For
ourselves, we certainly on such occasions incline to lively reading in
preference to deadly. But, although we may admit the contemplation
of death is perhaps nowhere more suitable than on a railway, still we
cannot help thinking it is somewhat superfluous to draw a passenger's
attention to any other engine of destruction than the railway engine.

THE ROMANCE OF ADVERTISING.
A FASHIONABLE STORY.
IMR. Pusch had intended to give the following puffs in an engraving, according to the custom of his Parisian
contemporary. But the retiring character of every member of Mr. Punch's staff of artists (not one of whom can
be prevailed upon to withdraw himself from intense study to mingle in society, and observe the fashions) inter-
fered with his purpose, and he has been obliged to enlist literature in the required service.]
[Advertise MENT.]
The brilliant saloons of HAUTNoBLEss House, one of the finest of our Metropolitan
mansions," were filled with a gay and glittering throng. Wit flashed, grace charmed,
and Beauty, enhanced by the power of WELVETEEN’s Lotion," smiled upon the scene. Nor
was Music wanting to complete the fairy-like illusion. One of Twangiºtox's magnificent
#. pianos," (thirteen octaves and a half, and treble action) touched by the white and taper
ngers of the elegant and Honourable LavinLA MontoRMINgtoN, pupil of SiGNor Pizzicato,"
gave forth its sparkling yet dulcettones. All was gay and gorgeous, and as was beautifully
observed by an accomplished reporter," who waited in the hall, “the lights shone o'er brave
women and fair men.” .
But appearances, deceive. Were all hearts gay, as that delicious music pervaded the halls?
Was there a delightful smile on every lip when the lovely º abandoning Italian
melodies, sang, with unutterable sweetnºs, the new, original, and highly effective ballad
“Dash from thy Brow that Diamond Wreath,” and instantly made it the song of the season?"
Let yonder graceful couple answer. Place aur dames. Whose sylphide form lightly presses

able bracelets, malachite and pearl," that classic wreath, purple grapes and silver leaves,' that

and º wrapped in admiration of the superb vase upon it, as the beauty of that
chef d'ºeuvre" might well deserve? He is faultlessly attired. How ſº fits that coat,
how neatly sits the vest, how easily, yet how . , fall those matchless trousers." The

They occasionally steal a glance at each other, and when their eyes meet, the lofty forehead

“Silly—silly-silly babies,” exclaims the high-bred beauty (who was educated at MADAME

I smell it, all over the house-and do look, Mr. P. %. it’s jumping
up and down! It's been doing that ever since it was lighted. I hope
it's, not going to blow up, as it did at the SIMKisses, you know.
Mr. P. The smell is imaginary; but there certainly is considerable
oscillation.
Mrs. P. (alarmed). Eh?—Considerable what, dear?
Mr. P. Oscillation—tremulous, irregular movement, MRs. P. Would

Mr. P. Why, there were considerable deviations, you know—

Mr. P. There certainly appears, to be more tubing charged than I

Mrs. P. He said from £30 to £35, you know.
Mr. P. Well, it certainly comes to more than that.

forming sulphuret | lead. ... (He jumps down.). Would you replace the

the guest into the lºcturer.) The first i. is, is it general or partial?
in the main or in the fittings? If in the former, you must apply to the

THE SHAVING LINE IN STAFFORDSHIRE,
CoRRESPONDENT of the
Staffordshire Sentinel
complains that MR.
Forsyth, the manager
of the North Stafford.
shire Railway, has or-
dered all the men em-
ployed on the line,
except the engine-dri-
vers, to cut off their
beards and moustaches
on pain of instant dis-
missal, and actually did
discharge some who re-
fused to obey this truly
barbarous edict.
Whether this blow at
the moustache move-
ment was struck by
MR. Forsyth off his
own bat, or at the in-
stance of his superiors, our informant saith not. Most probably the
mandate to mow the chin, and reap the upper lip, was issued in the first
place by the Directors; at least, we know that on most railways those
entlemen are determined close shavers. It is gross tyranny to inter-
#. with the mugs of railway, servants, except for the regulation of
their indulgence in beer, and MR. Forsyth, or his Directors, should
consider that a beard does not prevent a pointsman from turning his
points properly, neither has a tuft the effect of causing clerks to make
inistakes in booking; moreover, that the §. of the last-named
ornament must greatly prejudice the Imperial interests.
THE LAWYERS ON THE MOVE.
WE are glad to hear that the superior Courts are about to undergo
removal from Westminster Hall, for they have been at a stand still for
want of business so long that anything in the shape of a move will be
desirable. We understand that to avoid the contemplated expense of
the removal, Mr. BRIEFLEss has undertaken to, move the Court of
Queen's Bench for half a guinea--a sum for which he has moved it
before, and will be happy to move it again whenever the opportunity is
allowed him. It has been suggested that the profession has lately
been such a sorry look-out in Westminster Hall, and that Law has
indeed become so poor, that the Poor Law Removal Act might be
resorted to for the proposed arrangement. . Poor DuNUP maintains the
position—though, he can scarcely maintain himself—that the idea of
any outlay, for the purpose of moving the Courts is absurd, for from
the lack of business Westminster Hall is of itself a moving spectacle.
A PENNY SAWED AND A PUNCH GOT.
MR. PUNCH presents his compliments to MR. PLANCHE, and will
trouble that gentleman to request MRs. STIRLING to make a slight
addition to an exceedingly proper observation she offers, as “Comedy,”
in the very pleasant piece, the Camp at the Olympic. fins. Sriniiso
remarks, in her very happiest stage manner,
“And who for wit in comedy would seek,
When Punch Himsely is but a groat a week?”
To prevent º: and misconception, would MR. PLANCHE add
something of th d?
“Fourpence, I mean, to country friends supplies him,
The favoured Londoner for threepence buys him.”
With this addition the Camp will become a charming little piece.

THE SPEECH FROM THE THRONE.
As it may possibly, though not probably, be delivered on Tuesday nert.
(ExCLUSIVE.)
“My LoRDs AND GENTLEMEN,
“I am very glad to see you again, and to welcome you back
to the Palace of Westminster. The weather has been uncommonly
cold lately. This reminds me to mention that the ventilation of these
Houses been a good deal attended to, during the recess, and I hope
you will be comfortable. If not, please to impeach the rºle lil
fault, and I will take care that they get their deserts—at least.
“I see that a good many of you have followed the moustache move-
ment. Well, some of you are improved by it, others not. MR. SPEAKE
I observe, still shaves, but if he will search for precedents, he will fin
that his predecessors have often worn the ornament in question. I
don't think LoRD John Russell's looks well, and MR. Roebuck's
is decidedly a bad colour. MR. SERJEANT SHEE I fear dyes his
moustaches, or they would never be so black. But I do not see any
which look so well as those of my august Consort. (H. R. H. bows.)
“I do not hear anything satisfactory about the operas, but it has been
rumoured that my theatre is to be opened by SIGNOR. Puzzi. If so,
I suppose I shall have the pleasure of seeing you all there—my right
reverend friends of course excepted. But do not neglect divisions.
“I am happy to tell you that my indefatigable Mitchell has secured
MADAME JENNY LIND, at an enormous salary. She says that she will
sing at concerts only, but we shall see about that. Suppose I should

Bramah Pootras are coming in. I think I shall keep to the old ones.
I hope you have all seen the capital pictures on the subject in Punch's

conduct.
“GENTLEMEN OF THE House or CoMMONs,
“I shall take it as a personal favour, if you will begi
business as soon as you can, talk as little as possible, and rise rather
before than after twelve at night. I have privately requested MR.
GLADstone to restrict himself to six hours' speeches, and MR.
DisrAELI to ten minutes, exclusive, as regards the latter, of intervals
for expressive action. As MR. MACAULAY does not say much, and the
other two are about the only gentlemen you care to hear, I trust I have
made satisfactory provision for your comfort. The more people you
cough down the better.
“GENTLEMEN of THE REPORTERs' GALLERY,
“I beg that you will have the goodness to condense all reports
as much as possible; report no Member of the Brigade, nor any
Member, be he who he may, who rises after half-past twelve. Indeed
you will oblige me, as well as your wives, by retiring at that hour.
“My Lords AND GENTLEMEN,
“I don't mean to be kept in town one hour after the first
week in July; so whether your work be done or not, you know when
to have your country houses ready.
“I have only to say that we are all quite well at the Palace, and we
shall always be happy to see, any of you there... Lunch is ready every
day at two., I take mine with the children, but the PRINCE will receive
you. Good morning to you all.”

WHO 'LL CUT HIS NAILS.
of TUNATELY some
* Chiropodist
has been cutting
the nails of the
tiger in the me-
nagerie at Hull.
The operation was
successfully per-
formed, and the
animal has been
much quieter ever
since. Now we
wish some one
would take the
Russian Bear in
hand, and achieve
a similar feat (no
º intended) with
is nails. They
have been getting
dreadfully long
lately, and the con-
sequence is, that he
has been wishing
to come up to the
scratch in all direc-
, tions. It is time
they were cut; for the wretched beast goes howling about in a great
rage, being evidently on a false footing, and in great pain from the
awkwardness of his position. It is evident he will do injury either to
himself, or to any one who happens to go near him, if some power
remedy is not quickly applied. The case is at present interesting the
attention of both England and France; and we hope in a short period
to be able to announce the pleasing fact, that all the difficulties in the
way have been effectually removed, and that at last the Russian Bear
has had his nails cut ! The sooner this great chiropodic event takes
place, the better; for lately the unfortunate beast has been making such
a dreadful noise, that he has quite disturbed the peace of Europe.
FREEDOM OF THE FREE HOSPITAL.
SUBJoINED is part of a biography of an eminent surgeon which
appeared lately in the Lancet, accompanied by an illustration ridicu-
lously faithful to the text:—
“In stature MR. Hancock is rather below the middle height. His countenance is
animated, tho features strongly marked, and the quick intelligence of a dark eye gives
an expressive sharpness to #. in which may be found harmoniously blended
indications of kindness, intelligence, resolution, and thought. In his manner there is
an admixture of serene drollery and serious consideration, combining, too, the suaviter
in modo with the fortiter in re. With his pupils he is always found to encourage the
industrious, to stimulate the inattentive, and, by his solicitude for the interests of all,
he is deservedly considered in his school as a general favourite, and is looked up to by
the students as the pupils' friend. His style of lecturing is peculiar, and partakes of
the ABERNEThian order both in matter and manner; whilst the illustrative cases, from
their point, and the occasional anecdote, from its pungency, remiud us strongly of the
palmy days of GUTHRIE and Coopsh.”
Never mind, at present, the professional question, as to the system
lately adopted by certain medical journals of F. living practitioners
by publishing their lives. Attention for another point. Were anybody
to ask MR. HANcock whether he wrote the above glowing description
of his own personal appearance andº merits himself, the
fittest answer that MR.THANcock could give would consist, to speak
anatomically, first, in a contraction of the psoas magnus, iliacus internus,
biceps, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus muscles, and then by a
ditto of the rectus, the vastus erternus, and cruracus ditto, or, more ver-
nacularly, in an elevation of the thigh and a flexion and extension of the
leg, giving the poller pedia or great toe a strong impulse, and causing
the anterior extremity of the boot to impinge.
The Committee of the Royal Free Hospital, however, have not
scrupled to put a precisely similar question to a fºllº GAY
late Surgeon to their institution—and because they were not satisfie
with his answer to it, have dismissed him from his office—in which he
had earned much credit and reputation, but little else, during a period
of seventeen years. The daily newspaper reader will have seen that
a meeting was held the other day at the Hanover Square Rooms, for
the purpose of considering the best means, that could be adopted to
protect MR. GAY from the consequences of his dismissal.
A biography of MR. GAY had appeared in the Medical Circular-
unaccompanied by any remarks upon his features, such as the above.
But it contained matter offensive to the Committee; praise of MR. GAY
at the expense of their Lazaretto. It spoke slightingly of the exterior
of that edifice, and disparagingly of the internal arrangements thereof,
in so much as the following passage amounts to:—
“It is not too much to say that the position the Hospital has assumed is almost
solely owing to the exertions of MR. Gay; but for the success of his surgical opera-
tions, the Hospital would be little known.”
Upon the strength of this not very strong discommendation of the
Royal Free Hospital, the persons constituting its committee addressed
the following polite note to MR. GAY :—
“Royal Free Hospital, July 15, 1853.
“DEAR SIR,--In conformity with a resolution adopted by the Committee of
ºn of this Hospital, I take the liberty of submitting to you the following
questions:–
“1. Was the manuscript or proof of your Biography published in a medical paper
of the date of the 30th of March last, seen by you previously to its publication?
“2. Did you supply any part of that Biography?
“3. If that Biography was published without your knowledge or sanction, have
you written to the publisher to complain of any statements or allegations it contained 2
“If you will favour lae with an early reply, I shall be obliged, and am, dear Sir,
“Yours, &c.
“John GAY, Esq.” “(Signed) * W. H. FENN.”
To these cool interrogations, MR, Gay distinctly replied that he
had had nothing whatever to do with the biography, either in the
ways particularised, or in any other, except in havin º: the
editor with the mere facts of his birth and education. For the rest, he
had simply taken no notice of it. These answers were voted by the
Committee unsatisfactory. They were so, without doubt. But a body
of men cannot be kicked.
Treating MR. GAY as their servant-in plush—these people next
requested him to write a letter to the Editor of the Medical Circular, in
order to the correction of the Circular's article. A hospital surgeon will
do much to keep his employment—though it be its own remuneration.
MR. GAY complied; in as far as concerned the misstatements of the
Medical Circular, 'But this compliance again was unsatisfactory; the
Committee dismissed MR. GAY, and a Court of Governors confirmed
his discharge.
Hospital Committees and Courts of Governors have a perfect right
to do what they like with their own. Undoubtedly, they may treat
their surgeon with as much insolence and injustice as they please. They
pay their guinea, and receive their power—the privilege of being able
to bully and insult agentleman is one of the chief advantages of their
subscription. To talk to them is idle. The appeal lies to the College
of Surgeons. When a surgeon is tyranically and unjustly deprived of
his office, like MR. GAY, let the Council of #: body set a mark upon
the fellow who, dares to fill his vacancy. Let its members decline to
meet the sneak in consultation, and let all grades of practitioners
combine to hiss the snob out of the Profession.

invitations. The cause of these extraordinary festivities was the pro-
spect of another, Tractarian member for the University of ğ.
in the person of SIR WILLIAM HEATHCOTE, BART.; who, if returned
for that seat of learning, may be confidently expected to carry out the
views of his spiritual director, MR. KEBLE, which are supposed to be
very nearly identical with those of DR.NEwMAN. The }}}.} or
Grégorian Quadrilles, otherwise called the Papal Lancers, were danced
with much º and his Holin Ess figured in his usual style in the
Pastorale. The Borgia Galop was executed with enthusiasm; and the
evening, concluded with the good old-fashioned country dance, in
which all the company joined, of St Ignatius Loyola.
Deciphering Cyphers.
SoME little boys have been amusing themselves in deciphering the
cyphers that appear occasionally in the Times. We wish they would
exercise their ingenuity in translating LoRD ABERDEEN–anywhere,
so long as he was translated out of the Ministry—for we look upon
him as being the greatest Cypher of the present day.
FIGURES THAT MUST NOT BE QUESTIONED.
THE Spirit-Rappers have not tried their skill yet upon a Multiplica-
tion Table. But, perhaps, they do not wish to rap an answer out of
one, knowing that, if such a Table answered at all, it would most
likely speak only in round numbers.
A cockNEY’s QUESTION ON THE NAVY.
Does a Port Admiral mean an Admiral who is laid down for a long

MR. Rowland informs us that wearing the hat is very injurious to
the hair. If this is true, Quakers ought to be the baldest of men, for
they keep their hats on longer than any ºne else, and yet we know
several Quakers who have very good heads of hair. ...At all events,
indies are not likely to lose their hair from any similar cause, con:
sidering the present fashion of wearing the bonnet completely off
the head.

A SANCTIFIED “SELL.”
MYBODY wanting an affecting volume
of serinons will here find the promise
of one-taken from a chief page of
the Matchman, Methodist news-
paper :-
“[Adventisement.]—A New Year. —
These words—though simple in themselves
—are prolific of pleasing anticipations.
Cherished in our riper age, amid the war
and strife and anxieties of life, the memories
which each returning year awakens within
us are dear to each of our hearts, and in-
delibly engraved there. Thoughts of by-
gone times, dim and indistinct at first—
thoughts of other joys rise up from the
depths within, and grow clear and more
tangible before us. On each occasion we
recall with delight the many joyous scenes
which we have witnessed—scenes which are
inseparably identified with the recollections
of the merry days of our youth. But too
often these pleasing reminiscences are
chastened by other thoughts and images—
blending in one common picture the lights
and shadows of the past, and thus engrossed
in saddened strain, we muse-perchance at
times unconsciously—repeating to ourselves
those plaintive notes which still recall our
boyhood's task—
“They are past and gone! those merry ones,
That were so glad and bright.'"
The italics are our own—intended simply to call attention to the
tone of piety, which pervades the announcement, and suggests, its
purpose; rejoicing the heart of the serious reader with the expectation
of sweetness.
Taste a little more:—
“Soon another circle in the great journey of life shall be attained—soon another
New Year may be permitted to dawn upon our vision—soon may it be our favoured
lot to mingle in the circle of love, and administer to the cheering offices of friendship;
and should our spirits be chastened when we look around and behold those “vacant
places,’ let each heart that pulsates in health and strength, expand with gratitude to
that source from whence proceed those issues of life, ‘inestimable gifts'—and may the
‘weary and heavy laden' took in faith to the thousand means which have been mercifully
provided to mitigate their pains and to soothe their afflictions. And we may be per-
mitted to mention, as one .#. means of alleviating pain and suffering,”
the New Testament—one naturally surmises—or, at least, some tract,
or set of discourses calculated to afford spiritual consolation—something
powerful in that way, of strong anodyne, and at the same time awaken-
ing, properties. What comfort is offered to those who sigh for “vacant
laces?”—what rest is proposed to the “weary and heavy laden?”—
urely such as may be found in the unction of the Reverend OTTo
SHARON, or the affectionate earnestness of MR. MANNA? Not so.
No healing waters or balm of that description—but, simply,
“That extraordinary medicine, PAGE Woodcock's WIND PILLs, compounded by
MR. PAGE D. Woodcock, Lincoln.”
They are to “look in faith” to the Wind Pills of MR. PAGE D.
Woodcock. In place of references to experiences and conversions,
we are informed, as touching the Wind Pills, that
“Parties of the highest respectability in all parts of the United Kingdom have given
flºtimony to their wonderful efficacy in all complaints of the Stomach and
Bºwels.”
. And so all the allusions to vacant places and chastened spirits are
introductory to a puff of Wind Pills, and those who are “weary and
heavy laden” are invited to go to Mr. Woodcock for a patent medi-
cine to cure complaints of the inside. Woodcock is a nice bird! . It
may, however, be natural for a Quack to quote Scripture for such a
§. as that of inducing the credulous, to swallow his compounds,
but that the holy Watchman should afford him a conspicuous, place in
its columns for the citation of texts and the use of sanctified slang
with that object, can only be accounted for by the supposition that the
holy Watchman has its price—which is paid by the holy Watchman's
profane advertiser.
Railway Addresses on the Subject of Smoking.
RAILway GUARD to Third Class. “Where's the Man that has been
smoking He had better not let me catch him. I'll soon put his
pipe out.”
To Second Class. “Now, gents, smoking isn't allowed—it’s a fine of
forty shillings.”
7% First Class. “If you please, gentlemen, smoking is against the
rules. I must request you to put your cigars out.”
MORAL PARADOX.
A thirst for gold is denounced as unreasonable by those who, never-
theless, deny that it is a thirst for something solid.
MEMS. OF AN OLD REFORMER.
Men. To i. up the filthy habit of smoking as soon as I possibly can.
Mem. To harden myself against the insinuations of snuff, and to
put my hands in my pockets, whenever a pinch is offered to me.
Mem. Never to stop out later than eleven o'clock.
Mem. To answer my letters directly they arrive.
. Mem. To summon every cabman who is impertinent or neglects to
give me a ticket.
Mem. To tutor myself in better habits of punctuality, so that when
I am invited out I º, not arrive an hour after my time.
Men. Only to buy those things I positively want, and never to buy
anything until I have the money in hand to pay for it.
Mem. To take some energetic means to get, once and for all, out of
the debt of my tailor. -
Mem. To deal with my own tradesmen, instead of allowing the
servants to order all the things for me.
* To insist upon having all my accounts sent in regularly every
Week.
Mem. To entertain the deadliest hatred, and to wage the most re-
lentless war, against that most ruinous of all systems—Credit.
Mem. To try the experiment for a short time of seeing that the
cellaret, in which my wine and spirits are kept, is locked., .
Mem. To examine more carefully, my washerwoman's bills—and to
check them always when they come home.
Mem. To ascertain what stock of linen I have.
Mem. To discontinue the folly of giving !. to beggars.
Mem. To stop drinking when I feel I have had enough ' ||
Mem. To forswear unlimited loo, and learn chess.
Žem. Never to be in bed later than eight o'clock.
Mem. To walk always a good hour before breakfast. -
Mem. To begin to think seriously about marriage, and the policy of
insuring one's life.
Mem. To cultivate good friends and pure thoughts; to endeavour to
gain the esteem of all worthy people; to live regularly and respectably;
to wind up my conduct with my watch every night before I go to sleep,
and to examine whether it is too “fast” or too “slow;” to abandon
all divans and billiard-rooms; to shave off my moustaches; and throw
away my latch-key. -
Mem. (most important one of all.) Te put into practice the above
resolutions the moment I get a little more settled.
HEAVEN CONFOUND THE EMPEROR.
AIR-" God Preserve the Emperor."
HEAVEN confound the EMPERoRNicholas,
Acting at his present rate
Wanquished, humbled, and ridieulous,
fiuri him from his high estate;
Haunted always be his pillow
By the spectres of the dead,
Foully, on Sinope's billow,
By his slaves whose blood was shed.
Down, to rise expecting never,
Ali his pride and glory smashed,
May he hear the screams for ever
Of the women whom he lashed;
May the sum of human sorrow,
Caused by him, his conscience wring,
With no prospect of a morrow,
To allay its poisoned sting.
If, resolved on depredations,
Right he scorn, and might defy,
Rise against him, banded nations,
Hunt him down with hue and cry,
On him, like a wild beast, hounded
Be the dogs of Europe's war;
Let him ever be confounded;
Outraged Heaven, confound the CzAR
New Lamps for Old Ones.
QDEssa, according to the author of a new book on Russia, labours
under the disadvantage of being badly lighted. It is satisfactory to
know that an English company--a ship's company, in fact—has under-
taken, at the shortest notice, to light up the town in question so bril-
liantly as actually to cause reflection at St. Peterburg, and enable the
CzAR to read French and English handwriting very distinctly, even at
that distance. The iron tubes are ready laid, and the partier are only
waiting for a few posts.

THE FINEST BALSAMS OF ARABIA.
For once in the way we feel almost inclined to recommend patent medicines.
Those of which we are disposed to make such an exception in favour, are thus
advertised:
“Tarasures of the Desert.—The successful results of these remedies are without parallel.
Ali Ahmed's Antibilious Pill, Ali Ahmed's Cough Pill, Ali Ahmed's Healing Plaster. In
boxes,” &c. &c.
We can well believe that ALI Am MED’s Treasures of the Desert will cure all
the bile and coughs, and heal all the hurts, not mortal, that occur therein.
Two considerations only restrain us from prescribing these medicinal treasures
to all our bilious, asthmatic and wounded readers. We are not informed
whether the Treasures which ALI AHMED derived from the Desert are to
be accompanied or not, as remedies, by the diet and regimen which MR.
ALI was obliged to observe during his residence in that locality. If the
Antibilious Pill of Ali Ahwed is to be combined with eating and drinking
limited to a few dates and a little water daily, and with active horse-exercise,
we should think it very likely indeed to remove, more effectually than any
other pill, taken without restriction as to appetite, the worst congestion
of the diver that ever afflicted alderman. A stomach cough would as
certainly be relieved by ALI AHMED's Cough Pill, if nothing but that, besides
the dates and the water, were ºut into the stomach; wounds likewise would
cicatrise, at the same rate, under his Healing Plaster, in conjunction with the
same antiphlogistic sustenance. The other slight scruple that withholds us
from stamping these Pills and this Plaster with our approbation, is, that we
SONGS FOR THE POULTRY.YARD.
Now that poultry-keeping has become as fashionable, as
crochet, and every well-regulated young lady keeps her Cochin
China in º to a canary, we may naturally expect the
mania will soon affect the inspiration of our lyric writers.
We are convinced, indeed, that Songs for the Poultry-Yard
will be counted very shortly with the wants of the age, and
will soon supplant those senseless Will-you-love-me-then-as-nours
with which the sentimental school has far too long afflicted us.
We are, therefore, tempted to anticipate the national demand
and to supply at once a specimen which an poultry minded
maiden has our full permission to inscribe in her Album—sup-
posing that exploded nuisance can be anywhere found extant:-
Air-"Lesbia hath a Beaming Eye."
Lesbia hath some Cochin Chi-
nafowls of most º breeding:
Every one too fat to fly, -
So constantly she keeps them feeding.
Daily wakened by their crows
At some §: hour she rises,
And while their breakfast forth she throws
Her pets she thus apostrophizes:
“O my Cochin China dear-, .
I mean º China;
§: hens lay
e egg a day, , . -
But you lay two, my Cºchin China!"
Lesbia longed to see the show
Held lately in the street called Baker,
And so importuned me toº
That I at length was glad to take her.
Curious breeds there were on view,
“Silver-pencilled,” “golden-crested:”
“Double-combed” I noticed too
(I’d much prefer them double breasted !)
And there were Cochin China here,
Wastly costly Cochin China:

By ducks are reared,
But surely geese rear Cochin China!

REVELATIONS FROM RUSSIA.
From our Own Correspondent.
St. Petersburg, Jan., 1854.
E see that most accounts
of the state of things
here which have
reached your contem-
poraries are calculated
to give scarcely any
true idea of it. You
are cognizant of the
fact that the Emperor,
in the course which he
has pursued, and is pur-
suing, has been actu-
ated by religious enthu-
siasm, but you are little
aware of the extent to
which he is influenced
by that powerful mo-
tive. Our letters here
are liable to be opened,
and were I to write on
this subject without
proper reserve, the
consequence might be
a speedy relegation to
Siberia. I may, how-
ever, say that His
Imperial. Majesty's mental condition in reference to religion is as exalted, as it is possible
to conceive. . It not only displays itself in frequent acts of devotion, but also in other
wetions, which would be misinterpreted in England, but are here understood to be indications
of the prophetic state. --- - - -
f course you are familiar with the portraits of His Imperial. Majesty, representing
him in his military frock buttoned over his chest. This arrangement, for a mystic reason, has
been reversed. Nicholas now wears his frock tightly buttoned up behind. It is certain
that, in any case, he will present something like a front to the foe. - - - - -
On some principle, equally mysterious, the CzAR has addicted himself to divers peculiarities
of diet., Though suffering grievously from indigestion, and a martyr to bile, he persists,
against the advice of his physicians, in eating enormous quantities of caviare, which he has
served up to him swimming in DAY and RTIN’s blacking; and this being an imported
article, I wonder how he expects to get it in the event of a war.
The Autocrat used to be extremely partial to Clicquot; but he has of late abandoned that
beve for train-oil; in which liquor he compels NEsseinode to pledge him. Consistently
with this change of taste, he declares himself a Lamp–speaking, of course, symbolically-
and sometimes insists on being trimmed; as, to be sure, he deserves to be.
Severe as has been the struggle which the Emperor is maintaining with the Turks, he has
to contend yet more strenuously with spiritual foes. By attendants near his person
he is described as being in perpetual conflict with ghostly enemies, insomuch, that at times
he can scarcely walk a dozen yards without catching at objects in the air, which might be
supposed to be flies, but are invisible to the common spectator. - -
Add to these things that he has betaken himself to psalmody, and goes about, singing,
“Non confundar in atternum,” to the air of L'or, c'est une .. from Robert le Diable.
You know that His Imperial Majesty is styled something more than the mere EMPEROR
of THE Russians. Were you resident here, you would have to take care how you addressed
him as an earthly potentate. -
Under these circumstances I must confess that I entertain slender hopes of a pacific settle-
ment of the Eastern Question. This is the only chance. NICHOLAs—unlike most persons
in his predicament—does not cultivate a beard; and his medical attendants have not taken
away his razors.
GREAT MEETING OF THE IRISH BAR.
THE papers announce that a meeting of the Irish Bar has recently taken place, at which it was
ultimately decided, after a very hot discussion, that “the 5. of the Outer Bar shall
be at liberty to take half a guinea under the Common. Law Procedure Act.” We were not
present at the meeting, but we have reason to believe that the speeches were painfully
Many of the older juniors were affected to tears, in speaking of the dreary prospects of the
profession, and a veteran “utter,” venerable with }. of forty Hilarys, held up in
the air his empty brief-bag with a gesture of despair that had a thrilling effect on all present;
The discussion was alternately angry and mournful; but the latter was the tone that seemed
to predominate. Some amendments were proposed, and * other, things it, was
recommended that the half-guinea standard might be conveniently lowered to seven-and-six,
but this º was—for the present—negatived.
Letters of adhesion from the English Bar—as, represented by MEssRs. BRIEFLEss and
DuNUP–were read, amidst mingled feelings, in which astonishment seemed rather to prevail,
and more than one member of the meeting asked hypothetically, “What either of these
gentlemen could possibly have to do with it?” - -
e need scarcely say that] we fully appreciate the estimate which the Irish Bar has put
on the value of its services, and we can only hope that the readiness of the learned gentlemen
to take “half a guinea” will be met by a corresponding promptitude on the part of the
public in “ *::::...}. those moderate sums of ten-and-six, which the existence of the

ADMIRAL.
I’M a wonderful man of my age;
I’m gallant, and jolly, and brave;
The foe I’m prepared to engage,
For I’ve only one foot in the grave.
Tis true that I’m weak on my pins;
Tis true that I hobble about;
But whew when the action begins,
Do you think I shall care for the gout?
Of practice I think I may brag;
{ rofessionſ think I should know
For I hoisted my admiral's flag
Very nearly three decades ago.
º I surely must be,
any old sailor alive,
For my very next birthday, d'ye see,
Will make me just eighty and five.
They say I can't stand to my guns
Because I am shakey a bit;
But if Fºrmer NEPTUNE's old sons
Can't stand to their guns—they can sit.
Thiſ hint I’m unsteady of hand;
They say that my voice is too weak
For giving the word of command,
But a shout is less shrill than a squeak.
Tis true that I’m touched in the wind,
But at sea we have plenty of gales;
And then, if I’m pretty near blind,
I wink not when danger assails
Besides, in defence of the Porte
ifin battle i have to engage,
I’m one of the regular sort;
For perfection of Port is old age.
They may call me a stupid old muff,
And say I am better in bed;
But every day makes me more tough,
From the sole of my foot to my head.
Improvements, they tell me, time brings,
all that around us we see;
If it does so to nautical things,
It must have done wonders for me.
Then hurrah! for the gallant old tar,
The Admiral jolly and brave;
Shall he tremble at death from the Czar,
With already one foot in the grave?
Then give me my crutches—who fears?
My gout I have learned to survive:
Rule º ! hip! hip ! and three
Cineers
For the old boy of eighty and five!

THE
CLOCKWORK AT THE TOWER OF LONDON.
It is to be hoped that the preparations now in progress
for fixing a clock in the round turret of the White Tower
will be stopped. If there were any great want of clocks
in the neighbourhood, there would be some excuse for dis-
figuring the venerable edifice to accommodate those who
do not carry watches; but as it is, the addition of a clock
to that monument of antiquity will be as little useful as
ornamental. The White Tower, of itself, is a sufficient
indication of the lapse of Time. The clock with which
it is proposed to dedecorate it, is, we understand, to be
a four-faced one; which makes the matter worse: an old
friend with a new face looks odd enough; but a most
unpleasantly queer sort of feeling would result from
beholding an old fricnd with four new faces.
A Tender from Norway.
The Northern Courts may profess the observance of
neutrality during our approaching struggle with Russia;
but the subjoined overture, which has appeared under the
form of a newspaper advertisement, is a satisfactory indica-
tion of the side to which their feeling inclines:-
OBSTERS FROM NORWAY.-A firm in Norway is
1 desirous of making CONTRACTS with parties in England, for
LOBSTERS during this year's season.
“Season” means campaign, of course. Everybod
knows what Lobsters are intended for. We are very º
obliged to the friendly Norwegian firm; but trust that
we are sufficiently able to fight our own battles with our
own soldiers, and that no auxiliaries will be required by
the British Grenadier.
THE DomesTic REFoRMER ;
OR, HOW MR. PATERFAMILIAS MADE HOME IIAPPY.
SCENE 5–MR, PATERFAMILLAs has gone into the subject ºf adultera-
tions; and, as a first step to protecting himself, distrusting the beer
of commerce, determines to brew at home.
MR. P., MRs. P., and the family assembled at breakfast. M.R. P. is
reading the “Lancet.”
Mrs. P. Another cup of tea, my dear?
Mr. P. (laying down his brochure—to himself). Dreadful!
Mrs. P. The tea, MR. P. f. Well, it ought to be good. It’s DAKIN’s
best Family Mixed at 4s. 6d.
..Mr. P. No, MRs. P; the exclamation was forced from me by these
distressing revelations in this valuable periodical.
Mrs. P. Yes, I wonder how you can take it in, with all those
dreadful accounts of operations and cases. It’s enough to make one
*. one has all of them, sometimes, oneself.
r. P. You mistake, my dear. I do not refer to the purely thera-
peutical and surgical part of the journal-interesting as this undoubt-
edly is to minds familiar with the mysteries of our physical structure
but, to the series of analytical investigations of the adulterations of
food and -

terious practices would not be leſt to the conductors of a scientific
eriodical; it would be carried on by our cooks, our wives, and our
aughters—in ºur kitchens, MRs, P., and our store-rooms.
Mrs. P. Well, I’m sure it’s bad enough as it is, with the boys,
and their caustic, and phosphorus, and gunpowder, and things—with:
out the girls blacking their fingers, and burning their eyebrows off, and
lowing themselves up.
George. It was Newton, Ma, would make a mine in the front
garden. I told him what a jolly row there’d be, but he would.
Newton. I % wanted to find the point of least resistance, Pa.
Mr. P. (fondly). Dear child! (To MRs. P.) I tremblé for that
boy, my dear.
Mrs. P. So do I, my dear, constantly—
Mr. P. Lest he should be one of the martyrs of science some day.
Mrs. P. Yes, I’m always expecting to hear of his getting himself
isoned or blown u , or going, up in a balloon and never coming
own again, or some dreadful end.
Laura...I., wish, Papa, you’d forbid him trying experiments on my
canary birds. He hung poor Dicky over one of the gaspipes, the
other day, and turned on the gas, and if I hadn't come injust in time,
the poor dear thing would have been poisoned. He's never piped
since.
Mr. P. My dear, your brother's mind is an inductive one; far be it
from me to check it. - -
Newton. Please, mayn't I put one of EMILY's dormice into the
receiver of º air-pump, Pa? . .
Emily, Oh! you horrid, cruel little wretch! -
Mrs. P. No wonder, my dear, when his Papa encourages him in it!
Mr. P. Once for all, W. P., that boy's scientific bent shall not be
thwarted by any narrow consideration for his sisters' childish fancies.
I beg the subject may be dropped. To return to the adulterations.
Mrs. P. (meekly). Yes, my dear, the milk's shockingly thin.
Mr. P. That is a comparatively favourable case. The Lancet has
not detected, in twenty-four specimens, the presence of any foreign
agent more mischievous than common water.
Mrs. P. That’s just what I’m complaining of.
Mr. P. But what is that to the adulteration of our tea? Now the
sample in the caddy at this moment—its green colour is derived from
the double cyanide of potassium and iron-the Prussian blue of
commerce—an active poison. -
Mrs. P. Good gracious, MR.P., you’re enough to frighten one to
death !
Mr. P. The astringent flavour is due to catechu; the granular appear-
ance, so pleasing in your eyes, is the result of kneading with China
clay.
Yi. P. What they make the tea-cups of. Only think!
Mr. P. And your coffee—largely compounded, in twenty-five out of
twenty-eight samples, with burnt beans, chicory, and coffin-uust. .
Mrs. P. Oh, horrid! I told the grocer I was sure it wasn't right;
but I never thought they put coffins in it! - - -

great part, doubtless, of the husks of mustard-seed. This so-called

and its lightness to alum; while the latter may be rendered poisonous
by retention in a leaden cistern. -
Mrs. P. (ºil) Oh! how can you, MR. P. P. What is one to eat

Mr.P. It is difficult to say what article of food or drink to a
scientific apprehension is perfectly innocuous. But, in some respects,
we can protect ourselves.

Mrs. P. (more alarmed than ever). But consider the mess, my dear!
1 remember, when I was staying at the WADDELs, they tried to brew
in the large kitchen kettle; but it never did; and the servants all took
to drink, and MRs. WADDEL, had to get up at four o'clock in the
morning every Wednesday, and the house used to smell so, you can't
think, and it always came dreadfully expensive, and was never fit to
. Mr. P. The flavour, Mrs. E., is a matter of taste; but the expense
is a point susceptible of arithmetical proof. I have been calculating—
we pay 26s, the half-barrel; that is, 13s. per nine gallons. I find that,
at the present high prices of agricultural produce, that quantity of
sound wholesome beer may be made for,9s., which, at our annual
expenditure of £31.12s., for malt liquor, will give us a net saving on
the year of £10 8s.
rs. P. (with her old distrust of arithmetic). Well, it may be so by
figures, but you know, MR. P., your savings always do cost a great
deal in the end.

considerations of salubrity, alone, render it a duty to introduce an

been very extensively circulated, and has been the subject of much
praise on account of the spirit it was supposed to manifest. It now
turns out that the Duchess not only makes no claim to the spirit, but
that she reprobates the letter altogether. It is aº. offence to

all concerned in concocting them.
A Protectionist Dinner.
LoRD DERRY gave a Protectionist dinner, to his party on the 30th,

The meats were from the indigenous wild boars of the ancient Britons,

champagne from the native, unsophisticated English gooseberry.

HARD SWEARING IN CHANCERY.
THE shocking habit of swearing seems to be getting worse and
worse in the Court of Chancery, if we are to judge by a string, of
appointments which appeared in the Gazette of Tuesday. From this
source we learn that no less than ten gentlemen were appointed in
three days by the LoRD CHANCELLOR to be “Commissioners to
administer oaths in the High Court of Chancery.”
We cannot understand the sudden necessity that has called for the
enormous accession of swearing power that must be obtained from the
appointments alluded to. The machinery of “. must be materially
augmented by this arrangement—as far at least as the swearing
department, is concerned—though we fear that many will think the
horrors of Chancery are aggravated by the fearful influx of oaths that
the appointments in question lead us to anticipate.

Without reason or ruth, the Czar passes the Pruth;
For assistance the Sultan prays us;
But what statesman can deem the mere crossing a stream

If the Sultan can't see 'tis a mere guarantee,
His obtuseness doth sore amaze us:

ABOUT RATS.
THE question that has long divided the opinions of learned naturalists
—“Do rats leave dangerous places?”—has very lately been again }.
forth, and has been submitted to the consideration of various dis-
tinguished individuals,...believed to be admirably adapted to illustrate
the subject. The following, letters are a few selected from many
received by an enthusiastic inquirer, who proposes to offer all his
MSS. to the hospitable pages (for they refuse nothing) of Notes and
Queries:-
“The EARL of DERBy presents his compliments to —, and though
it is not his custom to make any reply to any person who may not have
the honour of his Lordship's acquaintance—nevertheless will make an
exception to his golden personal rule. His Lordship has no doubt
whatever of the fact that rats do leave dangerous places.--Has himself
known a rat—a very distinguished rat—that for many years dwelt
and rejoiced in MR. JoHN BULL's protected barn that—on his, Lord-
ship's accession to office—immediately, without so much as licking
his whiskers, quitted it.”
“MR. DisBAELI has little time or inclination to discuss the habits of
rats; but has no objection to inform his correspondent that for months
since he has not crossed the threshold of the EARL OF DERBY, or
entered the house of any other forlorn individual—(however be-starred
and be-gartered)—of that bigoted party.”
After such testimonials, it must surely be now received as an
established fact that—Rats do leave dangerous places.

SCHOOLS FOR ALL SECTS.
RICHARD’s himself again: that
is, MR. Cobden been
talking very sensibly at Man-
chester about education as
related to religion. He has
not, however, solved the diffi-
culty of combining religious
with secular instruction. It
may be serviceable to explain
how that object is to be ac-
complished. -
Religion is a general idea,
comprehending a great variety
of creeds; and religious in-
struction, to be complete,
must consist in informing the
mind with accurate notions
of all of them. Partial know-
ledge must lead to error,
which, on so important, a
subject, it is, especially de-
sirable to avoid. -
The appointment, in all
schools, of a Professor of Re-
ligious Knowledge, naturally
suggests itself as the means
of attaining the desired end.
But, in the first place, a
sufficient number of competently qualified persons could not be found
on any terms; and secondly, ##. could, the sects would squabble
for the appointment, each claiming it for a member of its own body,
unless the candidate belonged to no denomination in particular: in
which case they would all object to him. - -
This plan, therefore, is not feasible, unless the contending parties
would consent to draw lots, or toss up for the eligibility to the
situation; which is improbable. - -
The alternative is simple. A teacher of each form of religion must
be attached to all educational institutions. Judaism, Mahometanism,
Roman Catholicism, and Protestantism in all its varieties, from
Lutheranism to Latter-day Sanctity, must be represented each by its
Professor. A Flamen of the Fire Worship should be added if pro-
curable, and the system would be incomplete without a Tutor in the
Fetish. After an exercise with his Rabbi, the pupil should have a
lesson from his Ulema, next take a spell with his Popish Priest, and
then another with his Church of England Parson, to be succeeded by
a lecture from the Minister of Little Bethel, followed in turn by an
exposition, from a Mormonite Elder, of the faith of Joe SMITH, and
the final touch to the religious “instruction” might perhaps be given
by a Spirit-Rapping Medium. -
Seriously, this is the only way to give religious instruction—thereby
being understood an intellectual apprehension of all the facts of the
subject. It would take up a good deal of time. It certainly would also
cost a great deal of money; and it would not, probably, tend to implant
* faith, or hope, or love, in a child's heart. -
ut neither will causing a child to cram creeds and gabble catechisms
by rote. If religious instruction means training in religion; that is
another matter. That wants Professors of Charity, Purity, Humility,
and so forth: Professors whose lessons must be given out of school.
Persuasion can only be communicated by personal influence; and the
notion of imparting spiritual knowledge, as you would teach arithmetic,
is as º: as would be the idea of quenching spiritual thirst by a
proceeding similar to drinking brandy and water.
PLEASANT PROSPECT FOR THE RUSSIAN NAVY.

COTTON STUFF.
TAKE no heed of Aggression-allow it free scope;
What’s the use of opposing the Czar or the Pope?
*T will be quite time enough your resistance to make
When you're stretched on the rack, or chained up to the stake;
And º soon to begin to cry out, , .
When you find your back stung with the stripe of the knout.
What matter if Russia a seaboard obtain? -
Never mind till our navy she sweeps from the main,
Which I hope she won't do, if we i. cease to brag,
And to sing Rule Britannia; and lower our flag.
Let us learn to be meek, and submissive, and tame,
And in time perhaps Commerce may make her the same.
That no foes will assail us I firmly believe,
If we only continue to spin and to weave,
Sticking closely to work in our mills and our mines,
Not at all interfering to check their designs.
So, with calico-making the end of your lives, -
Never mind the defence of your daughters and wives.

Enthusiasm in Effigy.
IN the fervid town of Cupar they have been burning the EMPEROR
of RUSSIA-in effigy. ow admirably does the act illustrate the
reality of much popular enthusiasm! Why not burn the Russian fleet
in effigy P Why not blow down Sebastopol and storm Odessa in effigy?
We have small admiration for these avengers of wrong upon old §
stuffed with shavings or musty hay; and count their enthusiasm just as
much a sham as the rubbish they so heroically give to the flames.
Officering the Navy.
THE following are the new regulations relative to the physical recom.
mendations of Admirals desirous of active service. They must not be
above seventy-five, nor under seventy. They must not have been afloat
within the last thirty years; as the less they have known of salt water,
the fresher they will consequently be for the service.

"HE WICKED GIANT WITH THE TWO HEADS.
THE AUTOCRAT AND HIS ALTAR.
The idolatry that adores a forked animal, six feet high, as the “God
of the Russians,” is attended with some inconvenience. The holders
of the “orthodox faith,”, or believers in Nicholas, are beginning to
find the worship of that deity expensive. Over land, under sea, the *
following little fact has been flashed hither by electric wire:–
“The Court appears gloomy; the preparations for war have already cost enormous -
sums, and the Minister of Finance has laid his hands on the capitals of Loan Societies
conducted by private persons.”
The Nicolaitans of Russia have discovered that their divinity
requires sacrifices; and that the immolation of helpless Turks is not
enough for him. His own votaries must also bleed for his honour and
glory, not only from wounds received, some of them in the back, on
the banks of the Danube, but also in connexion with other banks, by
a copious effusion of the circulating medium.
War Steamers for Russia.
. Two war-steamers are being constructed on the Tyne for Russia:
this is a fact well known; but what we have now to relate has been
hitherto kept a profound secret. A distinguished tobacconist has sold
his wooden Highlander—who was allowed to be a striking likeness to
the EARL of ABERDEEN-for the figure-head of one of the vessels. And
yet the Czar has no gratitude!
LOVE IN LOW LIFE,
BEroRE marriage the man is very much struck with the woman, and
afterwards the woman is very much struck by the man.
THE BAND of Hope.—The orchestra of a theatre having struck in
the hope of getting their salary.
LAW WITHOUT LAWTIERS.
THE other day one of the Courts at Westminster was brought to a
dead stand i. that yery common cause—there being no cause that
could be proceeded with in consequence of the absence of counsel. All
the barristers that, had, anything to do at Westminster had something
else to do at Guildhall, and the result was a pretty to-do among the
judges themselves in consequence of there being nothing doing. It
seems rather an absurdity to select those barristers for work who have
no time to attend to it; but, of course, if HoRSEHAIR SENIOR is an
attorney, HoRSEHAIR JUNIOR will be instructed on behalf of all the
clients of the former, or, if SERIEANT SILVERTONGUE has got a name
the pretensions of every other Serjeant or Q. C. will be ignored; an
as SILVERTONGUE cannot be everywhere at once, he will perforce
neglect his clients in two out of three ot the Courts to which business
s him. Even the Old Bailey Bar has its favourites, and the “only
recognised bully,” or “the acknowledged hero of balderdash and
bluster,” will carry off all the briefs, to the utter neglect of the crowd
of learned candidates for forensic fame who “hang out” for practice in
the neighbourhood of Newgate.
The Barons of the Exchequer began a new, and we think a highly
successful game, the other day, when, there being no barristers to do
the business, the Bench went on without the aid of the Barºniº
through several causes in the absence of counsel on both sides. §:
have not heard that the suitors had to complain, and, indeed, the
probability is that more substantial justice was done between them,
than would have been the result if FusBos, Q.C., had been suffered to
encumber the matter with his lumbering learning, or FUSTIAN had been
allowed to confuse matters on the other side with his eloquence.
When the public find that barristers who are paid to plead don't plead,
and that their absence from their duty does not iº. the progress of
business, the public aforesaid will grow tired of paying exorbitant fees
for nothing at all, and time will be saved by the Court as well as money
by the suitors. We strongly recommend the precedent set by the
º: to the notice of the Queen's Bench and Common Pleas, for
law will lose half its terrors, and, more than half of its expense, if it
should be found that Judges will get at the law and facts of a case
without the intervention of counsel on either side.
THE NO TROUSER NUISANCE,
HERE has been lately a dis.
cussion carried on with a good
deal of vehemence as to the
propriety, or impropriety of
walking about the streets with-
out trousers—a practice which
is said to be connected with
the nationality of Scotland.
We regret that, Scotch, na-
tionality should have nothing
better than †. bare brawny
legs to stand upon.
We must confess we have
often been disgusted at seeing
a heavy looking Scotch clown
without any pantaloons; and
we have, thought the cry
against the impropriety of
allowing bullocks to pass
through the streets rather un-
reasonable, while a quantity of
no less offensive calves could

Nicholas in Danger.
CERTAIN accounts from St. Peterburg express the most affectionate
fears lest Nicholas—outraged by the shameful conduct of the allies
—should go off in a fit of apoplexy. Baths of human blood have
been taken by potentates of the like kidney, with, NICHOLAs, it is
said, with the happiest success, But, it is plain, that, the remedies
of one cease to cure in another; otherwise the blood of the three
thousand slaughtered at Sinope would surely have been as restorative

NOVELS FOR THE NURSERY.
EEMING it hard that our
rising generation should
be debarred from the in-
tellectual pabulum fur-
nished to their elders in
fashionable novels, and
restricted to spelling-
books and primers, or
to infantine historiettes
abounding alike in good
children (with an occa-
sional offender to act as

sons, we propose to give
a random chapter or so

their capacities. For

youthful sister, EMMA,

prosaic hoop, to revel in her world of romance and sentiment? Thus :

“Ah!” sighed the beautiful LADY ARAMINTA, gazing from the
casement of her nursery at the pensive moon, “where art thou,
ATGTIstris P”
Beside her ladyship, untouched, unnoticed now, lay her neglected
doll; her listless fingers clasped a new pink sash. “NoDDLE,” mur-
mured the maiden, “attire me for the ball; to meet thee once mºre,
Augustus!” she whispered musically. And now, her graceful pinafore
soon laid aside, the high-born damsel languidly resigned herself to her
attendant. Beauteous, youthful, scarce had she numbered seven
summers, all eyes were turned on AKAMINTA at the balls and soirées
which she deigned to honour with her presence. How to describe that
Moveliness? Arobe of pale pink silk, with eight sweet flounces, drooped
to her genour, while pantalons of finest Mechlin completed her attire,
How simple, yet how elegant! Silent and abstracted she remained
during the toilette, save when Noodle, perchance, unrolled a curl:

memory depict that fatal supper, when, hovering round the Christmas

allantly to win the choicest bonbons for themselves alone; and, as the
iquid sweetness soothed his spirit, murmured soft words of sympathy
and love. Andah! that honied kiss, those sugared lips!

In that festive scene of light and soul, who fair as ARAMINTA* who
noble as Augustus? His ardent glance thrilled through her heart;
her hand pressed his, and left init-ah, what? A pair of doll's shoes,
affection's offering! Soon, twirling in the "º, polka, again he
oreathed his love; and ARAMINTA, too, confided all her bitter woes.
“We’ll live on sugar-candy, love, and learn no more horrid spelling.”
“And my hair, love, Noodle shall not curl it, shall she? She
pinches it with tongs sometimes.”
‘No, no, sweet ARAMINTA; say, but the word, be mine! My pop-

Sibthorp in his Place.
Is answer to numerous affectionate inquiries we have to state that,
on the meeting of Parliament, Colony L SIBTHQRP appeared in his
place like a giant refreshed, or Gog or MAGog newly painted. We are
comforted to know that he had still no confidence in Ministers, and
that his voice was for war. We were gladdened to observe that his

THE MONKEY TRIBE IN ART AND LITERATURE.
IMITATION is the homage that dulness pays to wit—the acknow.
ledgment that successful talent receives from struggling quackery. The
public have been nauseated with the amount of homage of this sort
which Punch has experienced from those who have assumed, as far as
possible, his external appearance, without possessing any of his inner
qualities. It would be useless—perhaps unsavoury—to disturb the
ashes of the dead, and, we therefore say nothing of those who have
imitated—or rather aped—our outward form; but the ape tribe has
become so numerous and so indiscriminate in the objects on which it
lays its paws, that inexperience may sometimes be deceived by the
“spurious article” and the “base counterfeit.”
e “spurious imitation” mania will admit of many illustrations,
and a whole series of illustrations may be met with in the numerous
imitations of the Illustrated London News, which having become a
great success, has called into existence a crowd of imitators which will
eventually resemble the original in greatness—but only by the magni-
tude of their failure.
MR. ALBERT SMITH, the original monarch of Mont Blanc, has another
SMITH dogging him about with, another Mont Blanc; though we
believe the latter mountain, which has been labouring away for some
time, has been rather a barren speculation. In getting up an exhibition
we do object to the other Mr. Švita's attempt to confound himself
with the MR. SMITH by putting the name prominently forward in con-
nection with Mont Blanc, for the obvious purpose of profiting by a
case of mistaken identity. We cannot say º is pictorial views may
|be-for we have not seen them—but if they resemble his views of
fairness, we cannot think then, worth anything.
We hope these remarks will have the effect of abating what has of
late grown into a public nuisance, of a very annoying, if not of a very
dangerous character.

our seat could hold no more, and we fairly rebelled t all new

diamonds, which sparkled the more, as rold thing, she was shaky,
and had better have been at home. However, there was no setting
oneself against an afflicted person, so, in a sort of flurry, I offered her
my seat. She never thanked me, but took it, and I began to think
had been rather silly, when such a nice Bishop, who, it seems, had been
watching us, took my hand, and with a smile, p inted me down between
his two hters, and evidently told them to be civil to me. There
was no need, for they were running over with good-nature-fair, plump
things—very well informed, bless you, in fact I did not know half the
things they did—but not a bit of stuckupishness. They e me

“It was quite a House of Ladies. All down stairs, except one row

“A Turkish Poet, HALIL EFFENDI, has composed a war-

STICKING UP FOR TEMPERANCE.
UR leaders of the Teetotal
| Movement are - upon
the friends of Temperance to
stick up for the cause in a
rather unusual manner. Cir-
culars have been addressed to
the nobility and clergy, in-
viting their ‘
tion in giving publicity to an
illustrated placard,” containing
a fearful picture of the re-
by a woman with her face be-
smeared with blood, a few
children scattered about the
room with broken heads and
bleeding noses, while in the
foreground stands the husband,
brandishing the instrument of
destruction in the shape of a
huge gin bottle. This picture
is, we fear, terribly true to
nature; but we think it is
asking too much of the digni-
taries of the Church and the
Senate, to go, about, with an
utter disregard of the injunc-
tion which bids “Billstickers
beware!” and deface the walls of the Metropolis with unsightly placards.
If the call of the Temperance body should be responded to, we may expect a party of the
Peerage to be seen sallying forth, pastepot in hand, looking out for dead walls, and “doing
a bill” wherever an opportunity may, offer. The circular promises to furnish a supply of
copies to “those who will assist in placing them where º may be extensively, seen and
read;” so that if the Bishop of LoNDoN will kindly turn billsticker in St. James's Square,
he may expect to be favoured with a quire of the Temperance posters. We do not wish to

THE HORRORS OF FREEDOM.
We have often heard of the horrors of slavery, but it remained for the City Corporation
Commission to reveal to us the horrors of freedom, which have been declared in evidence to
be sensibly felt y a large portion of the community. The objectionable, kind of freedom is
“the Freedom of the 8. which is generally spurned, notwithstanding the profit that
accompanies it in the shape of exemption from toll, which does not prevent its being regarded
as to use the wretched pun ºf a City wag-an in-tolerable nuisance. The cause of the
contempt into which this freedom has fallen is the fearful possibility that he who º clvic
freedom may have civic honours thrust upon him; and this it is universally felt would be an
amount of degradation that few could exist under. There is many a decent tradesman of
London, or even merchant, who would consent to the position of a freeman, but recoils from
the idea of becoming a Lord MAYor—or even an Alderman—which might be the unpleasant
consequence of his having, in an evil hour, become Free of the City. - -
. One of the witnesses distinctly told the Commissioners now conducting the Corporation
inquiry, that there would be no difficulty in getting the inhabitants of the City to take up
their freedom, were it not for the insuperable dread they feel of being selected for City
dignities., Freedom would be acceptable to many, were it not for the remote possibility
of their being ultimately hung in chains—the golden chains of Aldermen. Perhaps, if a
guarantee could be given that the Freedom of the City should lead to nothing beyond, there
are many who would pay the few necessary pounds for the privilege of driving a cart through
Temple Bar, without him; pulled up by the oil-skinhatted functionary, whose duty it is
to shriek out “Now then!” and demand a few coppers in the name of the City from the
drivers of all waggons or carts—not adorned with the City arms—that enter the realms
of Cockneydom.
SOFTNESS OF HARDWICKE.
We find the following passage in a six-line burst of º: from the EARL OF
wicke in the House of Lords, on the day of the opening of Parliament.
"He could safely say himself, that he had never written or dictated any article in any paper whatever.”
We have much pleasure in bearing out the noble Earl in this rather unnecessary assertion,
and we have no hesitation in saying that we believe him wholly incapable of writing any
article in any paper whatever, No one ever, suspected his Lordship—as far as we know-

THE report states that along the line of procession at the opening of

with strong marks of popular favour.” We were along the whole line
of procession, but the only Turk we saw—except the Turkish ambas:
sador—was our old friend, SEEDY-AL-HUBBUR, the itineranºvºndor of
rhubarb, whose presence was the signal rather for “chaff” than ºn
thusiasm. He was certainly much “cheered,” but this arose apparently
from the cup that cheers and does inebriate. There was a dispute gºt

... If medical practitioners were paid in the manner above recommended,
it would of course be their interest to expedite instead of retarding
the cure of their patients as much as possible. In justice to them
some additional allowance would have to be made for cases essentially
of a chronic or tedious, nature. On the other hand it may be ob-
jected that some unworthy members of the profession would cheat, by
charging for consumption when the case was common catarrh, and put.
ting down small pox when the complaint was only chicken; but there
are not so many downright, rogues engaged in regular practice as to
give this objection much weight. On the contrary, such is the liberality
of . medical men, that if the.." would give a fair price for the
cure of asthma or scarlatina, no doubt the doctor would often throw
influenza or nettle-rash in.

“SCHOOLBOY” M.P.’S.

endeavours of right hon. and hon. gentlemen in the front rank to preserve their equi-

it will be very agreeable for the country to know, when he puts in

guished º
It was very natural that the schoolboy Members should, on the late
occasion, exhibit more than usual alacrity, “surging and tumbling into
the presence of º ;" for never since Queen ELIZABETH presided
at a bear-baiting, had there been a bear baited in Westminster from
which such capital ". was, expected. Therefore, we say, it was
excusable in the old boys, to be a little boisterous on the eventful
occasion. As they “smoothed down their faces,” it was charming to
see how young and green many of them looked.
The QUEEN-doubtless, knowing what noisy, tumbling boys are–
turned to the Duchess. “Duchess,” said the QUEEN.
“Your MAJESTY”—, ,
“You hav’n’t such a thing as a pint of nuts in your pocket?”
“No, YoUR MAJESTY,” answered the Duchess, by no means sur-
piº- is not etiquette to be surprised at anything-‘not a single

“That’s a pity,” remarked, the QUEEN, glancing down at the

HE BRITISH ADMIRAL LIFE PILL. This wonderful Pill, which
is taken by most of our oldest and bravest Admirals (known, in consequence, as
England's Admirals of the Blue Pill), is strongly recommended to all persons of infirm
habits, who cannot move from their invalid-chairs, or are tied by a gouty leg to one
position all day: no matter what their infirmities, or old age, may be, it will instantly
put them in a state to undertake the most active service, and enable them to rise from
a sick bed, and go through the most arduous duties at a moment's notice. Fortified
with this Pill, their constitution, let it be ever so shattered, will be instantly put to
rights, and capable of enduring the severest action. In the event of a long journey
being uisite, distance is not the slightest object, for this Admiral Life Pill is
warran to give the person who takes it the power of going to any station, and
occasionally beyond it, it having been found, after repeated trials on the temper of our
seamen, to keep, not only itself, but the taker, in any climate. It will strengthen the
weakest frame, and effectually stop all pains of rheumatics, or otherwise in a word,
it will make an old man better almost than a young one. Sold in Boxes, made out of the |
same wood of which the Winchester (SIR FLEET wood PELLEw, late Commander), and
other notorious ships were built, at different prices, varying from the value of a
screw steamer to a man-of-war. None are genuine, unless they have the Government
Stamp upon them. To be had, in any quantity, for home use or exportation, at the
Admiralty, who alone have the prescriptive right of disposing of them.

the Beard and Moustache Ques-
tion would have been treated
with some temper, being a sub-
ject of no importance; although
it was once a matter of con-
troversy between the Greek and
Latin

they differed. Gallant captains
wear moustaches — therefore
some praise them. Swindlers
wear moustaches to pass for
gallant captains: musical pro-
fessors also wear moustaches
to pass for foreigners; wherefore
others disparage them. This is
not philosophy.
. Although the bone of conten-
tion, Hibernically speaking, is
hair, yet it has been disputed
without hair-splitting — nay,
without the slightest attention
to common logic. Irrelevant
arguments have been adduced
on either side; just as if the
disputants were ladies, and had,
or could have, no beards or moustaches to debate about.
A futile objection to moustaches and beards has been based on the
supposition that they are the badges of covert red republicanism,
enmity to order, and membership of sccret and treasonable societies.
As if any conspirator in the drama of real life, and out of that of the
Surrey. Theatre, would sport a token of his designs; as if, instead
of declaring himself by a rough muzzle, he would not wear the very
smoothest possible face.

meant it to grow, there. So, Nature, meant the hair to grow on the
head, and the nails on the ends of the fingers; whence it does not
follow that Nature did not mean hair and nails to be cut—if expedient.
It has been asked: Why not, also shave the eye-brows?. Why not, in
a measure, if cver they should grow long enough to get in the way?
The patriarchs lived long lives, and are supposed to have worn long
beards; but it is not certain that the length of beard was the cause of
the length of life, whereas, length of life would undoubtedly occasion
length of beard, if the beard were suffered to grow all the time.

ey were wise. They would not take needless trouble. Therefore
they would not shave. There was no reason why they should shave.
They did not live by the exercise of invention. To them there, was no
need of the notions and new ideas developed in the human mind º
the five minutes devoted to shaving. Moreover, their diet and
beverages were consistent with the beard and the moustache. They
did not mop up turtle-soup; they were not in the habit of buryin
their faces in frothing pots of beer. Their moustaches, therefore, an
their beards were never agglutinated.
If Nature positively intended that we should wear beards, she
would not have §ed us to shave without much inconvenience.
She has not accorded us a similar facility of cutting of our noses. The
rational conclusion is, that she meant us to consult our convenience in
wº our beards or shaving them. - -
The beard of man makes its appearance at the time when he arrives
at the capacity of entering into the conjugal relationship. Hence it

ingly, the question of wearing it or shaying it, is, one that is best
determined, by being popped together with that other question, with
which it, is obviously connected. It is the province of woman, to
smooth the asperities of our nature, and it is for her to decide whether
i. will assert the prerogative to the extent of proscribing the use of
the razor.
The views of the Bishop, the Colonel, or other commanding officer,
the Official Chief, the Master of Clerks or Apprentices, may also be ad-
vantageously regarded in reference to retaining or abrading the growth
under consideration. -
He who is perfectly independent will wear beard and moustache iſ
he derives comfort from so, doing, unless, he also incurs ridicule, in
which case he will balance the positiye feeling of pleasure, against the
ideal pain that he may allow himself to suffer, or not, as he pleases.
A man with a round fat face had better shave if he would rather not
incur more derision than he is accustomed to. The same advice may
be given to those whose crop, if cultivated, would be red: but in these
cases all depends on the question whether the object is to creatc
sensation, or to consult case; please other people or one's self.

THE GIN AND WATER DRAMA.
At one of the cheap theatres, which peculiarly addresses itself to the
taste of the million, a drama is bein jº under the startling and
yet, familiar title of Gin, and Waier! ...We have no intention to
analyse this singular specimen of dramatic grog, which is no doubt
much relished by the audience, who are sure to drink in anything of the
kind with peculiar avidity. We should have thought it rather difficult
to write a play on Gin and Water, though a certain class of dramatists
may have the habit of doing so. It used to be a common idea that
authors drew their inspiration, more successfully from gin-and-water
than from the Pierian or any other spring, and the probability is, that
the dramatist who has on this occasion taken gin and water into his
head as a subject for the stage, has good reasons for doing so. It is to
be hºped that he will not become intoxicated by success, for if he does
we shall be inundated with plays of a kindred kind, and we may be
%. Rum and Milk to commence as soon as the run of Gin and
ater has concluded.
If this should be the case, half the Metropolitan theatres would be
converted into grog-shops, and we should be having Brandy and
Water, in six stiff tumblers and eighteen tableaux; or, Whiskey and
Water, in four acts and twelve toddy-spoons. We have not ventured
to taste the Gin and hater now being offered to the patrons of the
Drama; but we can imagine some effective lines which may, for aught
we know, be figuring in the playbills.

The first shall be from Miss MARY SHALE to Micah SLATE, Esq.,
Professor of Geology.
O THOU! far harder than the igneous rocks!
Whose thoughts and feelings, by some dire mishap,
As seldom turn to my bright eyes and locks,
As if the trap you worship were La Trappel
Why dost thou leave my merits for the faults
In veins of metal? W; when I would shine
Before thee in the mazes of a waltz,
Are the coal measures quite preferred to mine?
Once, when I stumbled on the river's side,
y arm sustained me, and I looked my thanks;
Whereon ygu talked, until I nearly cried,
About “Submergence and denuded banks.”
Once, when I deemed my ivory throat had caught
Your gaze,_my coral chanced to meet your eye;
And of its builders you discoursed, and thought
Less of your MARY than those folypi.
Ah! had my foot, which vainly courts your gaze,
But left its print upon the old red sand ;
Or, had a membrane, given my form to raise
Above the swamp, replaced my small white hand;
Or, had my lot been cast in Oxford clay,
With what awakened interest, I ween,
Thou wouldst have dragged my fossil form to day,
And told the world how lovely I had been
But all in vain Istrive to touch thy heart,
And fill it with a passion like to mine;
For, though I feel each day a keener smart,
The “non-progressive” theory is thine.
Then fare thee well ! since nothing seems to fire
Thy mind, save vast primaeval seas of ice;
For living beauty he will ne'er admire,
Who only thinks a schistose rock is gneiss (nice).
Our second instance is from MATILDA MEAGRIM to EUSEBIUs
Jon Es, Esq., F.R.C.S., L.A.C.
INSENSIBLE youth, while, each day, I descry
Fresh c in your sweet conversation,
I fear that your heart will be stopped, by and by,
By fibrinous ossification;
For though, when my hand rests a moment in thine,
A thrill through my whole frame is stealing,
Your eyes look as calmly and coldly on mine,
As if 'twere my pulse you were feeling.
And whilst, dearest Doctor, whene'er I expose
My tongue to your friendly inspection;
My lips pass unheeded, as if they were those
Of a subject you’d bought for dissection.
All the doses and pills that you send me each day
To cure me will never be able;
For I throw the contents of each bottle away,
And keep nothing at all but the label.
My illness requires, to cure it, dear youth!
o potions, pills, plasters, or leeches;
For I feel every hour, there must be some truth
In what each homoeopathist teaches.
Yes, ’tis like that cures like, and I’m forced to declare;
from my pains I shall never be freer
Till, my doctor relenting, his drugs shall prepare
rom CUPID's own pharmacopoea.

STATISTICS OF GRATITUDE.
THE Family Herald appears to be astonished at the circumstance
een a large which it relates in the subjoined paragraph:
Men UNDER THR Ice.—From the 19th of December last to the 6th of January, in St.
James's Park, 34 persons were immersed and saved; in Hyde Park, 6; in Kensington
Gardens, 2; and in Regent's Park, 7; total 49, whose names and addresses are known,
kindness to send donations to the judges in Westminster Hall, and to
the variºus Courts of Chancery. If the Chancellor had a Poor Box
at his dispºsal, we are quite sure he would find, among the ruined
suitors of his Court, a vast number of objects for the exercise of
charity. We know of several instances in which the unfortunate victim
of equity has been compelled to take a very good suit to the pawn-
broker's, because he happens to have had a very bad suit in Chancery.
There was a case reported a few days ago in which fifteen counsel were
engaged, and we were strongly tempted to enclose half-a-crown's worth
of Pºlº stamps to the Chancellor for the parties to the suit, but we
felt that the thirty stamps would go noway at all among the fifteen
lawyers, each of whom would make a mere mouthful” of the two
Queen's heads that would form his share of the booty. We trust that
Qur, hint will not be thrown away, and that a Poor Box in Westminster
Hall will shortly be in full operation for the benefit of the unfortunate
victims of law and lawyers.

Note and Query for the Slums.
It has often been asked why certain establishments for the sale of
old iron, rags, bones, and other miscellaneous articles, are called marine
store shops? Perhaps, because the stores are stolen in the main.
in addition to several who refused to give them. No subscription or donation has been
received by the Humane Society from any of the above persons, with the exception of
a poor boy, who requested the secretary to accept of twopence in return for the treat-
ment he had met with."
Qur domestic contemporary will, perceive that there is, in truth,
nothing wonderful in this apparently gross ingratitude. Exce t that
one poor boy, the persons alluded to had simply to thank the iety
for gratuitous brandy and water hot, which they voluntarily immersed
themselves or let themselves in for; and for which, if not gratuitous,
they could not thank the Society at all. Besides—unlike the poor boy
—no doubt not one of them is worth twopence.

We understand from a source upon which we can rely—that is to say we
can if we like, but we don't—that in consequence of the expected
demand for black in Japan, a celebrated London house intends sending
out several bottles of Japan blacking.

THREATENED INWASION OF AUSTRALIA.
SoMEBODY in Australia is said to be somewhat alarmed, because some
ussian ship is said to be sailing about in some part of the Pacific.
The nervous party, of whom there are always numbers waiting to be
shocked and shaken by the wires of the electric telegraph, will of
course be thrown into immense trepidation by the possibility that the
EMPEROR of Russia, tempted by the gold, may ºp. the T.
invasion of Australia. Society has always a quantity of quakers
y to go off into a fit of panic at one of Rumour's ſaintest reports,
and we hear that a meeting has already been held in Melbourne by a
few tremulous inhabitants, to consider the best means of fortifying the
coasts.
We shall be glad to hear of any progress that may be made in this
notable project for protecting several thousands of miles of sea shore,
against the one apocryphal ship now rumoured to be pursuing some
apocryphal . for some very apocryphal purpose, in some
apocryphal part of the Pacific. For our own parts we do not believe
that the Emperor of Russia's projects tena in any way towards the
Pacific, and we hope therefore that the nervous settlers who have met
to fortify Australia, will settle down quietly to the more laudable task
of fortifying their own nerves.
Reform and the Czar.
“Whisht 1" cried the Irish §º to a curious inquirer,
touching the pig's destination. “Whisht! he thinks he's going to
Cork, but I’m driving him to Fermoy.” MR. CobdEN has heard the
story, and duly adapted its double-meaning at the Reform Mºf at
Manchester. “They think I’m going to talk about reform, but I’m
only going to praise St. Petersburg.”
THE RETURN OF The ADMIRAL.
We do not quite understand the speedy return of the fleet from the
Black, Sea. . We hope this movement will not prove to be one, with
regard to which, the truth of the old saying as to quick returns and
small profits will be realised.
THE HEIGHT OF RESTITUTION.
We do not often borrow jokes; but for once must depart, from our
usual custom. An American statesman assigned, as a justification of
his countrymen's desire to possess themselves of the British fisheries,
the circumstance that they were “very valuable.” . Similarly, the
magnitude of the joke subjoined is our excuse for taking it from the
mes :-
“The Citancellor or the Exchequea acknowledges the receipt of the first half of
a £10 Bauk note from ‘Z. E. D.' on account of the Game Laws.”
The Gregalach acknowledges the receipt of £10 from a Lowland
ier on account of blackmail. What's-his-name Pasha, the Turkish
Minister of Finance, acknowledges the receipt of £10 from a Rayah on
account of “Haratch”—these are only faint attempts at joking after
the above manner. Conscience-money on account of Game Laws'-
the joke will be the death of us. The conscience that feels the
obligation of such payment must be morbidly tender. It is probably a
gouty conscience. Doubtless it is an expensive conscience too. PALEY
could never have afforded, indeed, to keep such a conscience as that.
But hold. Perhaps the remittance came from a game preserver, and
“on account of the Game Laws,” means on account of the expense to
which the sender had put his country in enforcing those laws against
poachers. That supposition, if correct, would entirely alter the case;
and ten pounds, instead of being a preposterous sacrifice would be a
shabby instalment.
The Cord of Sympathv.
WE hear a great deal from poets and travellers about the Hanging
Gardens of Italy. Considering the number of executions that take
place under Italian despotism, we are not surprised that hanging
gardens should be in request. We should expect to find in Napl
under the paternal sway of KINg BoMBA, that a Hanging Garden woul
be very suggestive of a rope walk.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ELIZABETH JONES, OF ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA, TO
RICHARD COBDEN, OF THE WEST
YORKSHIRE,
RIDING OF
HoNour ED SIR,-As almost
a natºralized subject of his
Majesty the EMP'RoR N1cho-
LAs — (Heaven preserve the
Emp'ror, as we sing by way of
morning and evening hymn
in our family of PRINCE Go-
THEwholeHoganoff)—I beg
leave to thank you on the
part of the English nurses
(wet and dry) of Russia,
whom you have righted in
your beautiful speech at Man-
chester. A snow-ball must
that heart be that did not
melt at jº, support of my
down-trod adopted country,
and of English nurses in
particºlar.
“I need not, honoured Sir,
say how many years ago.it
was since I was engaged by
an English house as wet-nurse,
and sent out—assigned Ithink
they called it—with cotton and
flannels to the care of a gent
in Russia, to be delivered to
the noble family of the Go-
THEwholeHoganoffs in their palace of Petersburg. -
“It was so beautifully timed—everything is in Russia under the
telescope eye of the Emperor—that I took the baby, he will be when his
father dies, PRINCE GornºwholeHogasoff-that I took that blessed
PETER from the month. The present Prince is a man of what is called
liberal notions in the widest way, not allowing any of the servants to be
flogged under his own roof, but always having 'em sent out to be
punished quietly and comfortably—(they’re flogged, as I’ve heard, at
so much a head)—and then to come back into the bosom of the family,
being thought none the worse of for the licking, and thinking none the
worse of theirselves into the bargain. But a contented mind is a con-
tinual feast. -- - - - -
“Well, no, the Prince being fond of all sorts of liberties (as is whis:
%; not but what the Emperor knows it; not a mouse squeaks in
ussia that the Emperor doesn't hear the cretur)—the Prince considers
an English nurse—especially wet—as a lively part of the English con-
stitution. In fact, no foreigner—not even a Russian—can be fonder of
everything English. You should only see him drink bottled stout,
and eat mince flies (which Fort’NATE AND MAson always sends us at
Christmas.) The Prince when he heard he was going to have a son
or a daughter, would have a nurse from what he calls and sometimes
sings dear old England the land of the free 1 (you should hear him do
Rule Britannia on the flute; only he now does, it in his own iron
cabinet, because he's heard his valet's a spy, and that might take him
to Siberia, where it’s so cold, I’ve heard, even the moon can’t change
herself). So-afore I knew where I was I'd made up my box—there
was no refusing such, good wages—and had bid good-bye to the
Shoulder-of-mutton Fields, Hackney, and was dropping down with
the tide, straight for Russia. That's at least some-years ago.
“Asi say, I took the little PETER from the month. It is n’t true—
(and I wish you'd said as much next time at Manchester) that Russian
babies are weaned upon tallow, and cut their teeth upon oakum—they
don't., PETER, as a baby, had, to be sure, at first, rather a Russian
look-but in three months he'd have passed for a true-born British baby
-a real English one—even at the Foundling. Well, the dear child every
day got so English, his own father didn't know him! When he was three
years, the dear little fellow sung All round my hat—yes, chirped it like
any blackbird. "Then again, what a child for beef and plum-pud-
ding—whilst, as he grew older, he took to knuckle-down, and ring-taw
(real English play) as if the games had dropt from the skies upon
him. Then, too, how he boxes! But to be sure he was allowed great
practice; all the servants being made to let him hit his little fists upon
their noses and think nothing on it. The Prince said the dear child had
owed all these blessings to me, his nurse, which was more than my
poor merits deserved—for I never knuckled down in all my life; whilst
as for using my fists, I could as soon have clapped a pair of wings /
For all that the Prince was so pleased that he made me a present-
being as I believe short of ready money, which will happen, with
ussian princes)—a present of a dozen slaves, which having no house
for, Isold to a Jew, who robbed me in the most unmanly manner-but
wly, honoured Sir, should I pour my private griefs into your breast?
- Being here in my native Hackney on business of the Emperor's, I
read your speech, and as gratitude is the weakness of our sex, I thank
ou, honoured Sir, for standing up for English nurses in Russia. Why,
onoured Sir, the Russians dote upon us. The offers I’ve refused—but
never mind that. We’re turning's. Petersburg fast into London. In
a few years, and you'll have a Queen Charlotte's Royal Lying-In, in
every street in dear Muscovy.
.." As you say, honoured Sir, we're º like England as snow's
like snow. There's the #. Club, with English gents the merchants
—with just the same white heads and red noses, and gaiters §: walking-
sticks—and they drink port-wine, and talk of bees wings in such away,
--you'd think you was listening to Bow Bell. One genſ (a dealer in
hides) was shockingly knouted—between ourselves—for black-balling
a native as would have passed for British, but the thing has been com.
fortably hushed up. One English Club! Yes, I believe we have one!
for Russia, doesn't my heart melt and my
eyes run over, when I see on Victoria’s Birth-day V. Rover the
ortico in our best oil, and hear Young Russia singing in better
nglish than-saving your presence—you could do it at Manchester,
God Sare the Queen /
“And then, honoured Sir, our horse-racing! Why—in the Season
-you'd swear you, was at Epsom only for the snow. We’ve real
English jockeys, and the horses theirselves have so taken to it, they
won't answer only to English names. It’s wonderful how we’re
getting like you. All we want, is the men with the peas-and-thimble,
and then, I should be a thankless cretur to despair of
“So again, honoured Sir, thanking you for standing up like a man
; a brother (saving your presence) for English nurses and English
orses,
And with all my *
“I remain, Honoured Sir,
“Yours Respectfully,
“ELIZABETH Jones.”
“P.S.. I hope you'll excuse mistakes, but the climate of Russia is
apt to lay hold of our tongues as well as our noses. I leave in the
same ship with BARON BRUNow, and shall be glad to send anything
from you to the EMPERoR through my honoured master, PRINCE
GoTHEwholeHoganoff.”
THE RUSSIAN EMPEROR'S WALK.
FROM his downy bed at the break of day
CzAR NICHOLAs walking is gone,
To look to his little affairs upon earth,
And see how his war goes on.
And pray how was the Monarch drest?
Oh! in a helmet with a crest
His frock and trowsers were indigo blue,
And one of his jack-boots the hoof showed through.
He saw a dastard spearing an infant,
In an “orthodox” warrior's fury,
And the Autocrat smiled, for it put him in mind
Of HEROD's exploit in Jewry.
He watched his Cossacks whilst they burnt a Turk's house,
With rapturous Hºlº
And the Emp'ror was pleased with the inmates’ cries,
For they soothed his irritability.
As an army-surgeon, on a fast horse,
Rode by on his avocations,
Ho hoſ' cried the Czar, “I have found my good friend
Plenty of amputations !”
As he passed Sinope's shore he saw
The work of shot and shell,
And he said, “In that place—which suffice it to hint—
That work, 'twill be owned, was done well!”
He saw a certain Minister, deemed a Minister to his mind,
Forced on in a certain House by a majority behind,
And the Tyrant quoted Proverbs—not, however, like a Clerk—
Hoº". ºws bite he hoped would be less bitter than
1S Dark.
France and England's fleets in chase
He fled with consternation,
And all the haste he was able to make;
For he found he had made a slight mistake
To doubt their co-operation.

PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION AND ANSWER.
We have a proposition to make to HER MAJESTY's Government'
We don't want office, for there is no office the Ministers could offer us
that would be anything like an º: to our own office, the world-
renowned 85, Flºet Street. We don’t want any appointment; for any-
thing of that sort which would too much occupy our time to allow us to
attend to our literary duties, though, it might be an appointment to us,
would be such a disappointment to the public as no amount of money
could compensate; What then is our proposition to the Government *
It is simp #: undertake the duty of #. aring answers to the questions
asked in Parliament; a duty in which all the Ministers—save one-
exhibit a sad deficiency of tact and terseness. The only member of the
Government who really knows how to give a good *|† answer
to a question is our friend PALMERSTON, who, from his style, would
seem to have been educated in the Punch school, but that the school
had not been founded when his lordship had arrived, ‘t maturity.
Nevertheless, he is one of those who are never too old to learn; and he
has, palpably, profited by our style of teaching.
To show our fitness for the task, we propose to undertake, we add a
few specimens of the answers we should have given to some questions
that have been recently asked of Ministers; and, as they usually have
notice that a question is about to be asked, there would be ample time
to obtain from us the reply required.
“New Church IN PARIs.—MR. WIRR wished to know, from the Comptroller of
Works, whether he had sanctioned the destruction of the Stables of the British
Embassy at Paris for the purpose of building a church on the site, which was said
to be worth £8000.
“SIR. W. Molesworth (would—if we had prepared his answer for him—have) said,
that as yet nothing had been decided, but, undoubtedly, if the Church should be
built over the Stables, it would have a stable foundation.
“N.B.-We are quite sure that this reply would secure a “laugh' and a cry of
"hear,' which is always so much political “capital' secured to the Government
“The Thames TuxNEL.-MR. A. Pellat r asked whether the Government intended
to make the Thames Tunnel available for carriage traffic.
“Sun W. Molksworth (should have) said that the Government felt no inclination
to go into the Thames Tunnel, as it was not very easy to see one's way out of it.
There had been a great deal of public money already spent, which might be con-
sidered to have been thrown to the bottom of the Thames. Some people slept with
their cash boxes under their beds for safety, but he thought it would not be advisable
to put any more money under the bed of the river, The engineer had certainly got
through a great deal of difficulty, but if he had got through the bottom of the Thames
as rapidly as he had got through the money, the job would not have been a very
lengthy one.”
It will be seen from the above specimens of answers, “flicked off” at
the moment, that we should adopt the style of reply that would be
sure to tell in the House, where a very little wit goes a very great way,
and, comes a very great way too, for it is usually of the most far-
fetched description.
INCONSISTENCIES 1
A PERSON arguing “merely to elicit the truth,” and losing his
temper because he gets the worst of the argument
Clergymen complaining of the ignorance of the people, and yet
ºrg. every plan for National education
:otchmen, full of Scotch grievances, leaving the country they
make such a fuss about !
Peace Society men breathing universal brotherhood, and indulging
in inflammatory language that is more than likely to lead to a breach
of the peace
High-titled ladies sympathising deeply with the slaves of America,
and keeping up a number of milliners working all night, because they
must have their dresses sent home by a certain time !
Mºtiate building the costliest prisons, and not erecting a single
School :
Irish members always abusing the Government, and yet too happy
to accept a situation under it!
Agriculturists paying enormous prices for Peruvian Guano, and yet
allowing all the London Sewerage to be wasted in the Thames!
Tradesmen giving their daughters the education of fine young ladies,
and expecting them to mind the shop ! ..
Condemning, a boy to prison for stealing a handkerchief, and yet
º wealthy shopkeeper, who has been convicted several times of
using false weights, to get off with a small fine !
Patriots declaiming loudly about the liberty of the subject, and putting
their servants in livery !
Exeter Hall, whilst there is so much darkness at home, sending
missionaries abroad to enlighten the heathens!
Government, seeing the charitable necessity of a ten-hours' bill in
thc cotton mills, not passing a similar measure for the benefit of the
tailors, the slopsellers, milliners, needlewomen, and other oppressed
i. wiſh whom the hours of working are only limited by the will of
e master!
AN INFALLIBLE QRATORICAL RULE –It is very strange that the
most garrulous speakers, no matter whether in public or in private,
are invariably those who are “unaccustomed to public speaking.”
|
PRETTY NAMES FOR THE NAVY.
Now that we are about to embark in war, in the cause of justice and
humanity, we really ought to change the momenclature of our Navy.
“HER MAJESTY's ship Furious has just returned from the direction of
Odessa,” says a º: paragraph. Furious / what a name for
a man-of-war whose character we naturally associate with the calm
courage of the British sailor. The mission of men-of-war, indeed, now
is to preserve peace, and we should not assign them the names of
angry passions, or of destructive processes and burning mountains.
Devastation or Stromboli / why, we might as well christen a ship
}} ships are named by christening) Beelzebub, or Tophet ; Primrose
ill would be greatly preferable to Stromboli; Devastation might be
exchanged for Beneficence; and for such appellations as the Furious,
the Terrible, &c., might be substituted the Amiable, the Gentle, the
Modest-not, however, the Retiring. Nay, if the Peace Society had
really done anything to preserve peace, a line-of-battle-ship, instead of
jailed Ajar or Agamemnon, might be denominated Cobden or
right.
ROME AND GREASE.
OT long ago the Frceman's Journal
announced a religious service to take
|. at the Metropolitan Church, Marl-
orough Street; informing those whom
it concerned that
“On that day at Eleven o’Clock, the Archbishop
and Clergy shall proceed to the solemn Benediction
of the Candles. Immediately after there shall be
a Procession with Lighted Candles through the
Aisles and Nave of the Church."
And also publishing the further informa-
tion that
“Those Catholic families who desire to have
their Candles blessed on that day by the Arch-
bishop will be pleased to have them sent in on the
evening before, or on the morning of the festival,
labelled, each with the name and address of the
owner, which they can have immediately after the
mid-day ceremonies.”
Is the benediction limited to candles? Are lamps not capable of
ºf blessed likewise? If one were to send a quantity of camphine
to the Archbishop, would he bless that? If gas only were burnt by
any person, how would it be necessary for him to manage? Incon-
yenience would attend the removal of the meter and the fittings, and
it is not easy to see how the thing could be done unless by getting the
Archbishop to bless the gas-works altogether, the whole plant. Still,
gas would be better adapted for blessing than candles, if the ceremony
involved sprinkling with holy water, which would not affect the former
but might make the latter splutter! Perhaps, however, it may have
the contrary effect, and may, by miracle, prevent, the candles from
guttering, or otherwise burning ly; which is the only advantage
that it is possible to imagine any one could expect from the blessing of
candles. Possibly those who send their candles to be blessed, however,
believe that their rushlights will come back moulds.
A QUESTION OF ECONOMY.
WE wonder what the Solicitor to the Post Office gets, in the course
of the year, for prosecuting the numerous postmen who are taken up
for abstracting money out of the letters. Considering the unfortunate
number of cases, we should say the sum paid to him must be very
large. We should not wish to have a better Christmas Box, than to
be presented with the amount of his Bill of Costs every year. Now,
would it not be wiser to devote that amount to the increase of the
postmen's wages, and so, by giving them a fair sum that they can live
upon, place them above the reach of temptation. It would put an end
tº all prosecutions, and the Post Office would be relieved of an
infinity of trouble. Moreover, we really, think that establishment
would find, in the long run, that the alteration had been one of great
economy; whilst to the public, who is the great sufferer in these
robberies, there can be no doubt that the change would be attended
with a considerable saving. What does MR. Rowland HILL say to
our proposal P

THE DOMESTIC REFORMER ;
OR, HOW MR. PATERFAMILIAS MADE HOME HAPPY.
The RESULTS OF THE GREAT HOME-BREWING ExPERIMENT.
ScESE.-At Breakfast., M.R. PATERFAMILLAs has been shut up in what
SPRAGGs calls the “libery,” from an early hour. The tea is cooling,
and the muffins are toughening. Repeated summonses to the breakfast
table have been sent to him in vain.
Mrs. P. (rising from the table and opening the door which leads from the
oreakfast room to “the libery”). Are you ever coming to breakfast this
Morning, my dear?. Such a beautiful plate of ham and eggs; and
here it’s getting quite cold.
Enter MR. P., importantly folding a voluminous MS.
Mr. P. I’m coming, dear, I’m coming; but really I wish you
would not interrupt me at these moments.
Mrs. P. Which moments, my dear?
Mr.P. The moments which I am able to snatch, from the harass of
my daily avocations, for communicating to the British public the results
of my own valuable domestic experience.
Mrs. #. (impatiently) Oh! more of those letters to the Times, I
Surpose
tr. P. (much hurt and with dignity). Those letters to the Times. I
am at a loss to conceive, MRS. P., what you mean by that peculiar
stress on the demonstrative pronoun. Let me tell you it is a duty as
well as a privilege to communicate one'sº: experience to that
reat organ of public opinion on points affecting heaſth, comfort, and
omestic matters generally.
Mrs. P. (argumentatively). Well, but what is the use of writing when
you know, my dear, they never print your letters?
. Mr. P. Delay, and perhaps, some slight irregularity, is almost
i. from the conduct of a vast establishment like that of the
leading journal. . But they will print my communications some day.
Meanwhile my letters, are accumulating—no doubt, for the recess-
when their columns will be more open to correspondents.
Mrs. P. You know the loads of letters you wrote them about the
saving from gas, and the advantage to health of that precious ventilating
apparatus of BELLows's. -
r. P. (uneasily). Yes, yes; on those particular points perhaps I
was a little sanguine.
Mrs. P. And then you’ve had £100 to pay the fitters and plumbers,
and I don't know what, if you’ve had a farthing, not to speak of
the smells and the ripping | the hall, boarding, and the rheumatic
attack you got going down to the meter that night. -
Mr. } I can’t conceive, MRs. P., the morbid pleasure you take in
recalling these unpleasantnesses.
Mrs. P. (going on without attention to the hint), And as to health,
what that ventilating apparatus did but give us all colds in the head,
I’m sure I don’t know; and then there was the taking it all down
gain, and coming back after all to the old plan of opening the windows.
§. didn’t require to call in MR. BELLows for that.
Mr. P. Well, at least, I hastened to inform the public through the
Times also, of these little drawbacks. Did I not?
Mrs. P. But they didn’t print that letter either. How can you
expect they will print any of your letters when they find you always
doing the same thing—one #. puffing a thing—

THE WALUE OF FREEDOM.
The City article of the Times, informed us one day last week, that—
“One of the largest diamonds known was deposited yesterday at the Bank of
England, by a London house, to whom it was consigned from Rio Janeiro. Its weight
is 254 carats, and its estimated value, according to the scale, £280,000. It is said to be
of the finest water, and without flaw, and was found by a negro slave, who received
his freedom as a reward.”
Freedom is, we know, beyond all price, and we can scarcely be sur-
prised at its having been changed at the comparatively moderate sum
of £280,000 to a negro in Rio jiào. Nevertheless, as an article is
worth only what it will fetch, and as slaves are to be had for a few
unds, we can hardly see the principle on which a negro who had
ound property worth £280,000, should have been mulcted of the
whole, and then presented with that which he might have pur-
chased any day for less than a two thousandth part of the sum alluded
to., The negro is, perhaps, perfectly satisfied. But we, fancy that if
we had fallen in with such a valuable “find,” we should hardly have
been content if somebody had walked up, taken possession of our
treasure, and then informed us we were at liberty to go wherever we
thought proper. It is evident that they manage these things in Rio
Janeiro more summarily, if not altogether better, than they do in
Eugland.

AMBASSADORS
IN LIVERY.
HERE are, . certainly, some
anomalies in our ceremoni
arrangements which cannot
be got rid of too speedily.
We refuse to let a servant
in livery pass into Kensing-
ton Gardens, and we refuse
to let a diplomatic servant
out of livery pass into the
House of Lords. The Ameri-
can Minister was positively
refused admission to the
ceremony of opening Parlia-
ment, unless he would con-
sent to bedizen himself with
gold lace, and, in fact, to
come in masquerade. H
he dropped in at any Vaux-
hall costumier's, or taken
Holywell Street in his way,
and hired a suit of second-
hand, regimentals, or dis-
guised himself in the cast-
off coat of some discharged
or dishonest flunkey, he
would have been at once
received into the presence
of Royalty, with the other
“Excellencies”, who had tricked themselves out in the tawdry trap-
pings demanded by the regulations of the LoRD CHAMBERLAIN. e
must protest, in the joint names of common, sense and common
rudence, against the absurdity and the impolicy of calling on a
oreign ambassador to put himself in livery, and, running, the risk of
giving offence to a great nation by an imbecile adherence to an effete
ractice, which certainly ought to have gone gut with. Bartholomew
air, and which might, at all events, be left to the Bal Masqué and the
Beefeaters. -
We do not blame the CHAMBERLAIN, who is the very head of all the
livery servants in the kingdom, and is not, only a state servant-in
livery—himself, but would be nothing if the livery system were to fall
into disuse at Court, where his occupation would be gone if the abolition
of external show were permitted. We admire the good sense of the
American Government and of the American Minister on this occasion,
and we earnestly call on Lord John Russell, Lorp PALMerston, Sir
JAMEs GRAHAM, and the other upper servants of the Crown-we have
named these three as the most # to be influenced by reasonable
considerations—to get permission of their Royal Mistress to imitate
the wise example of the domestic butler of the present day, by going
out of livery.
FORBIDDEN FRUIT.
Punch, in innumerable instances, is taken in. He is accustomed to
be regularly sold. But he is not to be hoaxed; and he cannot believe
that the following notice is, as a correspondent declares, to be read at
a certain small hamlet called Ashley near Lichfield:-
* notice.
“All Persons found Gathering Bilberries or otherwise in these wood on the Lord's
Day, will be prosecuted, and not be allowed to enter the Woods again.
“By order of the Lond Bishop.”
At least it is incredible that the last line of this announcement can
be true. The notice cannot have been posted by order of the Lord
Bishop. It must have been stuck up by somebody who owes that
relate a grudge; with intent to bring him into odium and contempt.
he rich are not #; to gather bilberries on any day...The poor have
no opportunity of gathering them except on Sunday. That day is not
the Jews' Sabbath, to be sure, nor are bilberries ears of corn; but the
analogy between both the two days, and the two kinds of the fruits of
the earth, is so obvious that it could not be overlooked by any Christian
bishop, and would quite preclude the possibility of his putting forth
such a notice as the above. The º of the word “otherwise”
confirms the view. People are prohibited from “gathering bilberries
or otherwise.” How otherwise can be gathered may be a Question;
but doubtless the illiterate author of the phrase meant by‘‘ otherwise,’
“anything else,” ears of corn, if wheat grew in woods, inclusive. The
bishop who would forbid the poor from gathering bilberries in his
woods on the “Lord's Day” would suggest a doubt as to what day he
alluded to. Be might be supposed to have perhaps invented some new
festival of the Church, some additional day to be sanctified in his par-
ticular diocese as that of the Lord-Bishop. Moreover, acting with
that consistency which enforces doctrine by life, he who denied the
#. bilberries on that sacred day would at least deny himself fruit.
He might not, perhaps, entirely fast; he might even partake of soup,
fish, roast-beef, and ºf in succession. But he would sto
at four courses. essert would not approach his lips. He wo #
drink his wine—but he would not touch a grape; he might imbibe
any quantity of port, but could not taste the smallest piece of
pine-apple.

DE OFFICIIS.
AMong the offices that have been “sold” in the City, we find the
following:-
Yeoman of the Waterside.
Sword Bearer’s Young Man.
Common Huntsman's Young Man.
Water Bailiff's Young Man.
..We should like to have some account of the duties of these indi-
viduals who have been º “sold” for the benefit of the City
revenues. The Yeoman of the Waterside seems to be avery inefficient
officer, if we may judge by the numerous depredations committed on
the coal barges; and which the Yeoman, if he did his duty at the water-
side should certainly be the means of preventing.
e Common Huntsman's Young Man, must be a curiosity in his
way, inasmuch as the Common Huntsman himself would seem to be a
very superfluous personage. We should like to know what there is to
hunt in the 9: or what occasion there can be for a Huntsman, unless
it is felt that the Corporation, may probably go to the dogs rather
speedily...We cannot better show our º, to the City than by
getting rid of these bad offices as quickly as possible.

JACK'S (ALWAYS) ALIVE!
SIR JAMEs. GRAHAM is a #º of business, and
a very good First Lord of the Admiralty; but, unless the
reporters do him an injustice, he has made rather a startling
announcement in the following passage from one of his
recent speeches. -
Speaking of the Coast Guard, SIR JAMEs is represented
to have said—
“While they were in the Coast Guard service, there was a civil
pension given to their wives and children if they lost their lives in that
service; when, however, they went into active service again, they were
of course put on the same footing as other men in active service, and their
right to the civil pension ceased.”
It seems from this announcement that when a Coast
Guard man dies in the service his wife gets a pension; but
if he should come to life again, the right to the pension
does not come to life with him; and he, upon *. “into
active service again” (after having been once dead), “is
put on the same footing as other men in active service,
and his right to the civifpension ceases.” We really re-
commend an individual who has become resuscitated in
such an extraordinary manner to try the effect of a bill of
revivor on his pension, so that the latter may not cease
when the former is no longer deceased.
Un-Parliamentary Intelligence.
SoME surprise has been excited # a rumour of a New
Writ, in connection with the name of MR. DUNUP. Being
aware that MR. DUNUP was not in the House of Commons
we have made some inquiries on the subject, and we find
that the learned gentleman has in fact “moved for a new
writ,” the truth being that he has moved in consequence
of another New Writ having been issued against him.

INDUSTRY AND IDLENESS IN THE NAVY.
very day we read, “All is activity
at the dockyards;”, but what is the
use of activity at the dockyards, if
there is nothing afloat but “gout.”
and “indisposition?”. The following
s paragraph is quite enlivening, and it
is really refr to contemplate
the vigour it seems to manifest:-
“We learn from Chatham that the whole
of the artificers and labourers in that dock-
yard are now, with few exceptions, at full
swing upon the task and job system of work,
and earning from 5s. to 7s. per diem. The
progress made daily in building the Orion,
screw, 91, is manifest even to an unprofes-
sional eye, and the mechanics of all grades
seem, under the excitement of the change of
system, quite a new class of operatives. The
sails and rigging of the Meeanee,80, are com-
plete, and she is ready for commissioning.”
This is all very satisfactory; but when we gone to read something
about the officers who are to be at the head of the working of all this
promising array of naval construction, we find such paragraphs as the
annexed to damp our patriotic aspirations:-
“We hear Vice-ADMIRAL Tug Hon. J. PERcy, commanding at the Nore, is suffering
from an attack of gout.
“REAR-ADMIRAL MARtis, superintendent of this dockyard, continues very unwell.
This is most unfortunate at this present moment.
“CAPTAIN FREMANTLE, of the Juno, is also indisposed.
“CAPTAIN SIB EveRARD Home, Bart., C.B., of the Calliope, 26, senior officer on the
Australian and New Zealand station, is reported by the mail just in from that region
to have died at Sydney on the 2nd of November last. CAPTAIN FREMANTle, in the
Juno, was going out to relieve him.”
With a gouty commander at the Nore, an invalid superintendent of
the dockyard, and an indisposed captain of the Juno, we are in a rather
unpromising plight, from which we are not yery. efficiently extricated
by the additional intelligence that the captain already declared to be
“indisposed” is going out to Sydney to “relieve” a deceased senior
officer. We do not wonder at the Greenwich pensioners, having been
thought of as a desirable accession to our maritime strength, and indeed
looking at the age and infirmity of some of our admirals, we may regard
the Greenwich pensioners as so much comparatively “young blood”
infused into the navy. -
... Eyeryone must be pleased to hear that England is ready to put forth
its “old spirit,” but we cannot help lamenting that the “old spirit”
has not some rather newer bodies in which to deposit it.
QUESTION or UNIVERSAL INTEREST.-How much?
THE RULE OF THE WORLD WITH EXCEPTIONS.
...A PARAGRAPH has been going the round of the papers having for its
title, The Rulers of the World, and # an account of the number of
sovereigns, with the peculiar title of their sovereignty. From this we
ascertain that there are in the world two Rajahs, one Sultan, one
Schah, one Ameer, and another singular animal, denominated an
Imaum. The last of these living creatures would, no doubt, if trans-
ferred to the Zoological Gardens, share the public admiration with our
old friend the Hippopotamus. few have seen a live imaum; and, if
Muscat could spare its head for a single London season, we, are sure
that the exhibition of the Imaum would do a great deal for the
Muscatese revenue. - -
By the way, we ought to protest against the omission of one ºr two
individuals, within our own {j. who have been omitted from
this list of “rulers of the world” rather unceremoniously. We have
been expecting to see a letter from the Beadle of the Lowther Arcade,
or his super-excellency the (six feet) High Keeper of Golden Square,
both of whom might consider themselves on an equality with any
Schah, and would look upon the Ameer as a mere humbug. There is,
also, many a street keeper who is quite an Imaum in his own conceit,

the benefit of it is to be extended to Ireland. We should not be in
the least astonished, if a Bill was to be brought in for “The Better
Management and General Improvement of the Thames Tunnel,” at
some wild Irishman springing forward, and gravely inquiring, “if
Ireland was to be included in the intended measure? for if not, he
should bring all his influence to bear in º inst it!” e

DOVES OF ST. PETERSBURG.
Is known throughout
ourhopeful land that—
some time since, when
the weather was at
3 the coldest, the quick-
silver all but freezing
—there were certain
good simple-minded
men, kept warm b
the fervour of faith
in human goodness,
who left their English
homes, their wives
and little ones, to
betake themselves to
St. Petersburg, that
they might have a
brotherly talk with
brother NICHOLAs, the
god of Russia; but in
very truth, only a
fellow worm of the
largest size—a worm,
in fact, almost as bi
as a snake—gilde
and coated with the
brightest metal and
the finest colours.
Brother NICHOLAs, in
all his bravery, should,
nevertheless, be sought and accosted by brethren in drab; the broad-brim
would, undoffed, approach the casque. The New Testament should be opened,
and words of life and charity be read therefrom in confutation of decrees of
blood and death. The Sermon on the Mount against the Ukase, issued from
our Palace | -
All honour and all praise to these worthy men! There is º, love in
their mild meek eyes: there is a sweet music in their very footfall. Let their
pilgrims' staves—when the men shall have rested from going to and fro upon
the earth—be hung aloft in Town Halls to quicken the thankful thoughts of
all after-comers. hat worthless old iron the sword of ScANDERBEg—what
a butcher's knife, the blade of a NAPOLEON-to those simple staves.
Well, we have news—news exclusive from our own correspondent—of these
F. They reached St. Petersburg, their shoes sound, and their spirits
opeful. They put up at the Snowball, kept by the worthy TEETOTALOFKY, to
whom they carried particular missives. Having shaved themselves, they
immediately proceeded to the Palace; and it was not their fault that they did
not walk straight into the very heart of the building... But a difficulty presented
itself in the form of a Grenadier of the Guard; he did not—albeit the Russians
are accomplished linguists—speak English; but soon gave symptoms, of his
perfect command of the bayonet, which he had . within a finger's breadth
of the stomach, of one of the pilgrims, undaunted, and the while desiring in
plain English, that he and the Grenadier of the Guard “should reason with
one another.” Now it seemed that the sentinel would, in another second, have
used the prima et ultima ratio—or first and last, reasoning of grenadiers—to
the puncturing of our pilgrim's waistcoat, with whatsoever remained behind it,
but §.”. though like PHAETON's, it had fallen from the sky-a carriage, the
smoking wheels j in flame, stopped at the Palace. -
A man—a hero—a ºniº. UPITER, that is a Russian JUPITER, flung
himself from the vehicle. He was striding—for he had on his seven-league
boots, and might as well have walked from Sebastopol, where he had been
incog, and whence he had for the dignity of the thing ridden-he was striding
ºft the open gates, when his double-eagle eyes fell upon our Pilgrims.
“Who are º: said the Czar, in the most mellifluous, English that he
learned at the breast of an English wet-nurse, long since ennobled, and married,
and divorced—and married again to Muscovite princes.
“Who are you?” asked the Czar, a second time,even more melodiously. .
Whereupon the Pilgrims took out their cards of business, and placed them in
the hands of the deity of Russia. . - - -
“Englishmen. I thought so,” said the Czar, with slight emotion. “Follow
-
E.
The grenadier of the guard immediately became as he was—even as he was
—before the advent of the Pilgrims, and withdrew his bayonet from the drab
waistcoat aforesaid. - - -
The Czar moved on; and doors of malachite, with key-holes set in diamonds
and hinges of Ural gold, were flung open; at least a hundred of them, and ji is
the Pigrims—their hearts no more puffed up or elated than though they trod
their native mud–still the Pilgrims followed. At length they arrived in a
cabinet, the walls whereof were polished steel; a cabinet, lighted from the roof
by a fiery carbuncle, Nevertheless, the souls of the Pilgrims stood erect as
before; neither did their knees shrink in their small-clothes.
“Sit down,” said the Czar, “and make yourselves at home. I’m sº
glad to see Englishmen, even”-and the Czar, smiled with that beautiful
melancholy in his smile for which he was so celebrated at the flower show, in
happier, days, at Chiswick—“even, when they no longer see
my Ambassador. , My good friend” and the Czar § his
hand in, the most paternal way upon the right knee of the
elder pilgrim-"my good friend, what can I do? Speak
freely-unburthen yourself. In fact, whatever it is, mention
it... What can I offer you?”
: Friend NichoIAs, thou canst offer peace,” said the Pilgrim.
“With the greatest pleasure. But have I not dome so?
Have not MENscHIKQFF and ORLOFF, and—my very good
friends” —and the Czar's voice slightly trembled, .dº? the
Pilgrim is short-sighted, and mi it have been º
lip, a little quivered—“my good friends, I have been shame-
fully misrepresented. Nevertheless, I hope I bear with evil
like a Christian, and have moreover put up a Te Deum for some
of my enemies. I hate the thoughts of war. As for my army,
that necessary evil, I sometimes suppress a shudder when
I review it.”
“And thou dost crave for peace, NICHOLAs ** asked the
Pilgrim, with a sweet, hopeful smile.
“I’ll take the Sultan to my heart like—(that is, allowing
for the difference of º-Hi a brother. I’d kiss your
$º hand like a father. I’d embrace FRANCIs Joseph
e an uncle—FREDERICK WILLIAM like, a man who has
married his sister, and Louis NAPOLEon like anything. My
good friends, peace is what I want—peace and my own way,
and the Autocrat of sixty millions shall be found as gentlé
as any shepherd. And yet, England has joined with France,
and ABERDEEN–(who can trust in human nature after that?)–:
ABERDEEN has sent British men-of-war into the Black Sea.
The sacred Black Seal Nevertheless, I’ll forgive all—all for
the sake of peace; peace, and my own way. But let me intro-
duce you to the Empress.”
The Empress could not be seen.
“Very well, another time. In the meanwhile, come and
see the Empress's doves,” said the Czar.
And the Pilgrims followed the Emperor, who led them to
a dove-cot where doves were lodged as only the doves of
º: can be received and done for.
. “How willingly.”—said the Czar—“in token of my aspira.
tions, how willingly would I send a pair of these doves to one
and all of the powers maliciously leagued against me!”
“I, tell thee what, friend §. 'll take a pair to
friend VICTORIA, and say to her what thou hast said.” Thus
spoke the elder Pilgrim.
“I thank on.' said the Czar; cordially shaking the Pilgrim
by the handſ: “but wait awhile and know us better. Wait
and you shall be the bearer of the doves. Look here”—and
the Czar moved a sitting dove from off her nest, and took
the two eggs, laying them, warm as they were, in the hands
of the Pilgrim. “These will be hatched—I know so much of
doves—in a few days. Wait then, two or three weeks, and
you shall take the doves in token of peace”—
... Peace at any price, friend NICHOLAs f said the Pilgrim.
“Peace at any price,” answered the Czar, “to my sister
VICTORIA.”
And then—unseen by the Pilgrims—the Czar replaced the
dove's eggs, by two bullets (he always carries them) from
his waistcoat, pocket; and the guileless Pilgrims departed
to i. at the Snowball until those leaden eggs should be
hatched. -
And such is and has been the policy of the Czar—to treat
for peace, the while his dove-like thoughts sit upon bullets.

ALL FOR THE SMALL CHARGE OF ONE COPECK 1
THE GLORIOUS BATTLE OF SINOPE i !
Magnified One Thousand Times!!!
There, on the left, you see the brave Russian sailors a thrashin' of four
times their number of bloodthirsty and invading Turks, and the cowardly
Admiral of the latter a blowin' up of hisself and Ship all along of being
afraid of fallin' into the hands of his magnanimous foe.
RATHER WHINEY PYNEY.
THE followingº from the Musical World has affected us
to tears—the result of excessive laughter—though we don't believe a
word of it:-
“THE Misses Pyre's Piano.—At the concert given at Wigton, on the 18th ult, the
Misses Pyne were not a little surprised to be set down to the identical pianoforte
which formerly belonged to them, and upon which Miss Louisa Pynº played the first
piece she was ever taught. This incident so affected her that she shed tears on leaving
the room.”
The MissEs PYNE are ºf - - -
without delight, and we cannot believe in their sentimentality, over
an old piano which has seen better º better keys, better wires,
and better everything. If we were to su denly find ourselves playing
on the very word on which we had made-in infancy—our first pun,
we should not think it reasonable to go off into fits of anything but
laughter, and that we fear would be rather difficult. If this sort of
sentimentalism were to be encouraged there would be no end to the
inconvenience that would result from it. The potboy might swoon at
the sight of the first pot he ever brought home, on his leathern strap;
and even the bailiff might be melted into maudlin tears at the sight of
the first man he arrested. Business is business; and if the
Misses Pyne have, in the course of business, to sit down to the
cracked piano of childhood, they have only to make the best of it,
like all the rest of us, under analogous circumstances.

The Corporation of London, their Mark.
THE full significance of the symbol which the Corporation of London
have set up at Egham, may not occur to everybody. A petition pre-
sented by the inhabitants to Parliament states that it is an intimation
that, the City coal duties of 18, 1d. per ton, from which they had
previously been exempt, are now imposed upon them. The hierºglyphic
or emblematical notice alluded to is the Civic Arms. The well-known
dagger that the City shield is charged with is what proclaims in its
plenitude the intent of the Corporation. The dagger is in a peculiar
sense their mark. It denotes that they mean to stick it in.
THE ART of Conversation.—You convince a man-you persuade
a woman.
SOME PUZZLES FOR PALMERSTON.
PALMERston, having undertaken to listen to all º from all
quarters, is now called upon to answer not only for everything, but
for º and he was accordingly catechised the other night as to
the truth of some rumours that reached, London by the Submarine
Telegraph. His Lordship expressed with his customary good humour
his inability to stand sponsor for several thousand miles of wire, which
runs on at a considerable length and lies to a marvellous extent
throughout the continent. We shall not be astonished to hear that
LoRD PALMERston has been gºely asked by some sapient Members
of the House of Commons,—“Whether the statement made in Pall
Mall last night by an individual professing to carry with him a second
edition of the Globe eveningº to the effect that the EMPEROR of
Russia has been assassinated, is founded in truth, and whether the
| Home Secretary has ºy objection to lay the papers—of the preceding
|evening—on the table?”
As Lord PALMERston will perhaps prefer having some notice of the
questions that may be put to him, we will º: the following as
being quite within the probability of the case, if we may judge, by the
absurdity of some of the notes and queries to which he has lately i.
subjected.
1. To ask. LQRP PALMERston whether the Government was aware
that a cry of Police!” had been raised at a recent meeting in the City,
and whether it was with the sanction of the Government the policeman
walked into the room? and if so, whether his doing so was the result
of º correspondence with the Civic authorities, and whether
his walking out again was a step approved by the Home Office?
2. To ask LoRD PALMERston whether the crossing-sweeper in the
Turkish turban is in this country in accordance with any treaty now in
existence; and whether, if the combined, fleets, should sweep the
Black Sea, the individual in question will continue to sweep the
crossing—under the protection of our own ernment.
3. To ask Loºp PALMERston whether the disappearance of a
lacard from Holborn, where it formerly appeared daily at a hair-
er's shop, announcing that “Another fine Bear will be slaugh-
tered,” has been withdrawn in consequence of any remonstrance
addressed to the English Government by the Czar, through BARox
BRUNow, and whether it is true that there is any order in Council
º the sale of hog's lard and salad oil, under the title of
perial Bear's Grease. -
4. To ask, Lord PAIMERston whether the performance of the
Burning of Moscow, at Astley's, was stopped at the instance of the
Austrian Ambassador, and whether there will be any objection to
Fº all the correspondence—if any—that has passed between the
ount DE ColloFEDo, CHEvaLIER Bunsen, Mr. Widdicomb, and
LoRD PALMERston, on this subject.
A BRANCH OF THE PROPHETIC PLANT.
A, FELLow calling himself PROFEssoR ZoroastER has been sending
handbills about Manchester, soliciting public attention to a science
which he calls Astro-phrenology, and says that he practises “on moral
and Christian principles.”. In short, the profession of this Professor
lies in professing to tell fortunes—at from half-a-crown to ten shillings
a fortune. He announces that “he will be happy to give attention and
such advice as his long experience in accordance with the Holy
Scriptures may render necessary.” . How such experience can occasion
any necessity for such advice it is for servant-maids and other parties
interested to consider, recollecting, besides, that the Professor's experi:
ence with the volume he alludes to has, of course, principally consisted
in operations with the “Bible and Key.” He displays, however, a
familiarity with Scripture, in quoting it on behalf of fortune-telling
by the stars, which may be said to amount to a contempt for it.
Žº. is to be regarded as a species of Sage, that, without onions,
supplies a stuffing for Goose. We should like to visit this philosopher
in his cell, a proper cell having been provided for him, revolving the
crank for an Astro-phrenological problem.
“All-a-growing! All-a-growing!”
Close, philosophical observers, who amuse themselves in watchin
every little turn and change that takes place in the outside world,
declare that they can plainly see indications of a Beard and Moustache

of the success of the anti-razor movement, since Nature herself is
lending her countenance to it.
The BEARD-GRowing Movement.—The cold, cynical, smooth-faced,
close-shavers, who denounce the wth of the Beard and Moustache
Movement, have been compared by a Sporting young gentleman to a
pack of harriers, whose great delight is in running down the Hair.

WHO’D HAVE THOUGHT IT
He following paragraph will
perhaps astonish but
those who, like ourselves,
have long ceased to feel as-
tonishment at anything, and
who cannot help thinkin
that calf's h." surprise
is a dish that places a calf's
head in a very appropriate
position:-
*The LATEST IMPRovenienT.-
A German offers for sale instru-
ments' for indicating persons'
thoughts by the agency of nervous
electricity.’ The price of the in-
strument is two guineas.”
There seems to us to be
nothing very new in this
invention, for we have often
known people, betray their
thoughts by being shock-
. nervous, which is
evidently the same thing
as “nervous electricity.
The instrument we have
sometimes seen applied with
success, in getting at the
thoughts, through nervous action, is an Old Bailey Barrister. The
only point of the affair to which we object is the price of the instru-
ment. We look lipon, two guineas as a great deal too high a price
to pay for anybody's thoughts, unless they are such thoughts as those
of PascAL, which might be worth the money; but in most cases the
maxim of “a penny for your thoughts,” which has long ago been
fixed by the old saying, is quite as much as the thoughts of any body
are likely to be worth in these days of dull reflection. If the instrument
is really what it professes to be, it might be worth while to apply, it to
LoRD, ABERDEEN, for the purpose of finding out, what he, thinks of
himself in reference to his proceedings on the Turkish question...We
might also ascertain whether the EMPEROR of Russia really thinks
the English people will all
ow him to continue in the course he has
adopted. Nervous electricity may be very useful in the latter case; but
we trust the electricity will %. accompanied by a good supply of thunder
from the united artillery of France and England.
RESULTS OF THE CENSUS.
A very interesting pamphlet, called the “Results of the Census,”
has been “put into our hands” by a person into whose hands we put
a shilling. We think there are some results of the Census which
have been overlooked by the ingenious author, who will perhaps supply
the omission in a subsequent edition. -
One of the most remarkable Results of the Census, was its effect on
the age of that, beautiful production of Nature, familiarly known as
the British female. The Census had, in fact, the same sort of opera-
tion on the ages of women, as a declaration of war would have on the
Public Funds. Our own cook, who had been familiarly quoted in the
house as upwards of fifty, fell suddenly to thirty-eight, at which she
has since nominally remained; but no settling day has been º:
#. is it likely that there will be any settling at such a clearly ideal
gure.

Royal Authority to inspect certain docu-

The object of the Poor Knights is to ascertain
whether the rich Parsons are or are not
cheating them annually out of the greater
part of £15,000. The documents in question
are those of the Star and Garter order of
Knighthood. Of course it is not to be pre-

documents because their deeds will not bear
the light... This should not be supposed in
their particular instance simply because it is

of a Cathedral. Stealing through “long-drawn aisle and fretted

actual propensity to rob. The architecture of screens, one would think,
suggest covert peculation, and artifices for self-aggrandisement are
hinted § the enrichment of arch and canopy. Storied windows may be
imagined to impart a stain to integrity; corbels to grin an incentive to
roguish tricks, and the mave of the sacred edifice to communicate such
a character as to justify . it with the prefix of a K. In short, it
apprars, that the atmosphere of a Cathedral is impregnated with the
same spirit as that of a stable; and that, as ostlers, grooms, and other

THE THEATRE OF WAR.
IT is the fashion now with
rs
KEAN, Mr. SMITH, and
others, when they produce
a new piece, to issue a
of reasons; in which
they state, the great au-
thorities they have con-
sulted in the production,
puffing themselves gently,
all the while, upon the
enormous º: and ex-
pense they have been put
to in order to make it
effective and profitable.
The EMPEROR NICHO-
LAs, the Russian Manager
of the Grand Theatre of
- War, upon which the eyes
of Europe are at present fixed, intends following the managerial
example at the end of the long peace which the world has enjoyed.
It is expected to run somewhat as follows:–
“In selecting the plan of campaign—which I have º done after
expending cans of midnight oil, and pounds of Russian tallow candles
in the research, I think I am sufficiently justified in %.6 from the
well-known version of warfare usually adopted at the Cirque Olympique
and Astley’s... That version may be very effective in the representation,
but as the killed of one battle generally figure as the conquerors of the
next, and as wounds are only represented º the mimic aid of red
ochre, whilst whole armies are put to flight by two or three British
sailors, or a dozen French gendarmes; that plan, recommende
as it may be by the successful practice of many years, will never
answer my Imperial purposes. M; Theatre of War, will be carried on
on very different º es. I mean to have real, killed and wounded.
The wounds of % soldiers shall be real, bleeding, and, if possible,
mortal wounds. ere shall be nothing false about my productions—
no false castles to be blown down like a pack of cards-no false ships
to sink down a trapdoor — no false enthusiasm, no victories, as
false as the supernumeraries, who are paid a, shilling a night to win
them, and do not mind, so long as they are paid, what side they fight
upon. No! the destruction of . wars shall not be such as can be
swept away aſterwards by a couple of stage, carpenters, but shall be
terribl in its nature, and as terribly devastating in its effects,
theatrical and otherwise.
“In coming to this conclusion, I am guided by the examples set me
by my noble predecessors PETER THE GREAT and CathFRINE, who
were two of the grandest performers that ever distinguished them-
selves on the Russian Theatre of War. They made a great show in
history, and so will I; a halo of blue fire still burns round the victo-
rious associations of their names, and I wish mine to be illumined with
a similar fire—only I am determined it shall be real blue fire—the
bluest blue fire that can be procured!
“No expense has been spared to give pro -
scenes of the war. I am ambitiously resolved that it shall be a war
such as has never been seen on any previous theatre. It has already
cost me thousands and thousands. It may put me to the outlay of
millions. at is the consideration of a few hundred thousands,
more or less, to one who has 56,000 millions at his disposal? I rise
superior to such small sacrifices! - - - -
“There may be a question as to the propriety of interfering with
the plan that for so many years has been successful in Europe, far
surpassing the brilliant achievements of any previous war... My
answer is, that I was left without the choice of arms—I was driven
from one engagement to another till I was compelled to act on the
defensive, and open a theatre of my own. what benefit is a
peace to me if I cannot take § in it? An actor in my position
cannot afford to remain idle. , No name can be earned-no glory can
be achieved—no laurels can be won to wreathe my imperial brow
unless I am actively engaged To this Theatre of War, therefore, do
I intend to devote all my energies—to give it the advantage of every
scenic effect and accessory—to elevate it to that height of success
which shall enable me to crush all possible rivalry. , Besides, such
idle questions ill become the lips of an Emperor to reply to—they are
best answered with the mouth of a cannon . The “Danubian Princi-
lities” afford a grand opening for a new campaign, and it is my
intention to commence there early in the Spring, and to bring such a
corps into the field as shall safely defy all opposition. To ensure this,
I have laid down the plan of an engagement that I am sanguine enough
to expect will be as successful as the one at Sinope, and other places,
where all resistance sank as º as a Turkish three-decker
r effect to the different

“Let it not surprise you—O Effendi—that I, a Turk, and born in
Constantinople—(may ALLAH mend its roads for the better ambling of
your mule in your next comings and goings)—that I talk thus of the
greed of the English—namely, business. For know that when my
beard was downy as a blackbird in the nest, I was sent from Stamboul
to a certain house_to learn and note the ways of men and cotton in
Ehlis, otherwise Manchester. My mother heaped dust upon her head,
and my grandfather—(my father was with the Prophet)—tore his
beard; but the cords of gain are twisted of gold, and who shall resist
them..., For what says the sage? “Will much knowledge create thee
a double belly, or wilt thou seek Paradise with thine eyes?” “Is it
possible.”—asked §. grandfather, when I was about to depart upon
travel-‘is it possible that the idea of an intercourse between mankind
should make any impression on our understandings? The Prophet
forbid!”. Nevertheless, I came to Manchester.

“Before I quitted Stamboul, the Koran was read by many of the
faithful by a new light. As Ghazali, the slipper merchant did not
altogether believe that—having run across the §. finer than the
finest cotton thread of Al Sirat—he will drink of milk and musk at
the Prophet's Pond; and then, walking on the earth of the finest wheat
flour (what a free trade in corn there must bel), pluck pom
and grapes from the tree of Túba, everything jº food soever
at the wish of ALGHAzAII. Nor did ALJANNABI, the baker, altogether
hope to gather silks and satins from the leaves growing in Paradise;
and to to him of the seventy-two immortal wives (besides the old
ones restored as beautiful as cver and as good as new), he would say
the Prophet wrote in the darkness of riddles; and that some wisdom
may be tied in a knot like a serpent—to undo it is to be stung for the
pains. erefore he would shake his head at the two-and-seventy im-
mortal maids of Paradise, the wives set apart for the meanest believer.
|He would declare—the Prophet could not, in his heart, have meant it.

*For consider it. You have a book upon which you build your
mosques, and by which you impose tax, and tithes for the comfort and
subsistence of your Mufti. Now, in this book, it is said to be most
beautiful for all men, and most like a true Mufti—as Mufti should
be—to divide a cloak, a loaf, yea a cup of water with the naked, the
hungry, and the thirsty. It is good to sell all and#." to the º: -

money-merchant's, and the MUETI or LoNDoN dwells in a palace with
iosk upon the Thames, and rolls in filthy lucre even as a Thames eel

“And the moral I drew from these and this is—it is not well or wise
to think that the Turkey of to-day believes as hard, hard truths the

BRITANNIA TAKING CARE OF THE SOLDIERS CHILDREN.
“GOD DEFEND THE RIGHT!”
Stirring our English pulses out of their even beat,
Flushing our English faces with an unwonted heat,
From heart and tongue, of old and young, rises that high appeal,
To wake a might which in the fight defieth shot and steel.
From humble homes and stately domes that cry goes through the air,
With the loftiness of challenge, the lowliness of prayer.
Honour to him who spoke the words in the Council of the land,
To find faith in old England's heart, force in old England's hand
Who said that peace had eaten out the manhood from our race?
That love of gain, and fear of pain, for valour left no place?
That leave to spin and gold to win, was Englishmen's sole prayer—
Which so we got it mattered not how all besides might fare?
Back in the slanderer's throat we fling the cold and craven words:
Never of old with manlier hold our fathers clenched their swords;
Never in stour of Agincourt, or Cressy's desperate fight,
With lustier breath, defying death, rang “GoD defend the right !”
Nay, all the more—that, oft of yore, when rose that battle cry,
'Twas kingly strife that staked men's life, nought recking “how”
or “why.”
Ambition's game of sword and flame, serfs played as sovereigns chose,
Whose right or wrong seemed weak or strong, by sheer event of blows.
'Tis not so now; the knee we bow, as those who, kneeling, see
That war's event is ever bent by an all-wise decree,
That we who fight for truth and right, must win, whate'er betide,
For that the God of battles goes forth upon our side.
That right is old which we uphold, and call God to defend;
It took its birth with new-born earth, with out-worn earth shall end;
Mis-shapen Wrong, however strong in means, in minds, in men,
Before the power of Right must cower to the abyss again!
What wonder then, if Englishmen are in this faith so bold P
That each man's hand grips to the brand his father drew of old?
What wouder that, with hearts elate, our soldiers seek the fight,
To the great cry—from the nation's heart—of “God defend the
Right!”

to his Constitution, and the worst results to himself, but the best to

ports will be closed, he will be in a great measure deprived of medicine,

men departs to fight the
battle of freedom, the band
of the regiment Fº the
regulation farewell of “The
Girl I left behind me.” This
morsel of military music is
º no means of a tender or
plaintive character, but on
the contrary expresses con:
siderable exhilaration and
rather high animal spirits.
And if the very best of the
irls whom the soldier leaves
ehind him were imbecile
cooks and other females cap-
tivated by the mere human
figure in a red, coat, his
: chief emotion, in leaving
them might well consist in
alively sense of deliyerance.
But among the girls left
behind him by the British
soldier there are some in
leaving whom he leaves his
jº". of his bone,
flesh of his flesh. The remainder of that flesh and bone he may, alas!
perhaps leave on the banks of the Danube, where the fallen Warrior will
make a brick in our barricade against the Tyrant of the World—that
would be! For so much of him Christian burial is all that we can add
to Turkish funeral honours. But his moiety left here among us, we
may do something for—or leave it alone. If we take the latter course
it §: miserably washing and º in nine cases out often
finally begging, or into the workhouse. at will be, the ordinary and
º ſlot : the girl whom the soldier leaves behind him in the person
or nis wille.
It is therefore to be hoped that, “A NAVAL OFFICER,” writing in the
Times, will not vainly have called attention to the position in which
the wives of soldiers will be placed by the departure of their husbands
on foreign service for the defence of Europe and m d against
the enemy Nicholas. As to the soldier's pay, he half starves upon it
himself, and after his semi-starvation there remains not the value of a
crumb to be handed over to his wife and º children. The girl-
and, maybe, the little girls and boys-left behind º have surely
a claim superior to that of the mate and Fº of the lazy clown and
the sottish and improvident mechanic. It is just that relief should be
ealt out to them with no parochial hand, but with a palm a little wider
open than that of the relieving officer, and in a spirit of consideration
somewhat more kindly than the beadle's. Slashing away at the foes...of
England—who can slash in return, to some extent—is the soldier
to feel that his wife, neglected by that England, is making abortive
attempts to earn a miserable subsistence by mangling linen? In
the approaching conflict with the Power of European Darkness, our
soldiers will not disgrace their country by faintheartedness, at the
thought of the girls they left behind them. Let not the country disgrace
itself by only thinking of those girls!
A RATIONAL JEW BILL.
t * week’s Parliamentary intelligence includes the statement
au-
“Ma H. Drummond presented a petition from a place in Surrey, praying for the
restoration of the Jews to the Holy Land."
The only reason that can well be imagined why the inhabitants of
any place in Surrey should wish the Jews restored to the Holy Land
!. Act of Parliament, is the existence, in their opinion, of too many of
the children of Israel in their own neighbºurhood. There are laces
in the vicinity of the Victoria and Surrey Theatres, where the Jewish
community is perhaps more numerous than respectable; but to remove
the principal population of the New Cut, for instance, to Palestine by
a legislative J. would be a proceeding of tyranny tantamount to
treading in the hoof-prints of the EMPEROR Nicholas. It, ma be
suspected that those who want a bill for the deportation of the Jews,
desire by that illiberal measure to counteract other bills operating to
the Jews' advantage against themselves; and that they would not care
a button for the restoration of the Hebrews to Jerusalem if they could
only see them at Jericho.
A Russian, QuTBREAK.—The papers say...that the EMPEROR
Nicholas has had a breaking out on his face. To us it has long been
obvious that he is rash all over.
BEGGING BISHOPS.
It is a melancholy fact, but a fact nevertheless, that the ARchi-
Bishops of CANTERBURY and York, and the Bishop of London are
reduced to beggary. We have before us, at the present moment,
three *ś etters, signed º J. B. CANTUAR, P. Ebor,
and C. J. London. It is not, however, for themselves that these
exalted prelates have exercised the º of the mendicant. Happily
the palaces of Lambeth, York, and Fulham are still “above want,”
or at all events so well founded as to spare the humiliation of “asking
for more” on the part of their respective occupants.
The two Archbishops and the Bishop of London have, neverthe-
less, commenced pushing about the begging box, or sending round the
hat with considerable energy, on the part of “the poorer clergy” with
whose “hardships and difficulties,” they tell each other, they have a
“well-known sympathy.” C. J. LoNDon in writing to P.E.Bon, speaks
with decent horror of the “greatly increased number of poor clergy-
men,” and sets forth statistically the uncomfortable fact, that “there
are about 4818 stipendary curates, and 1354 incumbents not having
more than £200 per annum.”
One might hope, that as the occupants of the various Episcopal
alaces are aware of this, dismal state of things among “our poorer
rethren in the Ministry,” as C. J.London fraternally designates the
clerical victims of poverty—one might hope, that under these circum-
stances the Bishops would be ap to each other to make certain
sacrifices of luxury and º or the relief of the necessities of the
“poorer brethren.” We are, however, doomed to be disappointed; for
the Archbishops only write to the Suffragan Bishops, with instructions
to touch up the Members of the Church in General, for the benefit of
certain schools, and accordingly the Honorary Secretary has commenced
stirring up the public with a shower of circulars, asking every
whose position in the Blue Book or Court Guide may favour the idea
of his having a shilling to spare for his “kind assistance.”. For our
own parts, while thoroughly approving the principle of providing better
for the poor clergy, we cannot help thinking that a little better approach
to the equalisation of the incomes of all the “brethren in the ministry.”
would be the most satisfactory mode of dealing with a difficulty which
has turned two Archbishops and the Bishop of LoNDoN into beggin
letter writers—a vocation that is not much to be enviedor ...;
however excellent the motive of the mendicants.
THE WORK OF THE PEACE SOCIETY.
If ever we get out of the present European scrape—as we hope we
shall live to do, and perhaps even with a few shillings in our pockets,
some of us—in order that we may not so readily get into another, a
combination must be formed for the purpose of doing the very reverse
of what has been done by the Peace Society, Nicholas evidently
mistook the bleating of that association of lambs for the voice of the
nation, and presumed thereon. Now the British Lion is roaring too
late. We shall know better in future; and our endeavour must be to
institute a War Confederacy, which shall hold periodical meeti
whereat violent harangues shall be delivered, and resolutions passed,
and subscriptions entered into, for the purpose of ** settle-
ment of international questions by appeals to arms. It s further
issue tracts inculcating the principles of combativeness, communi-
cating knowledge of the arts of destruction, and enforcing the pro-
priety of perseverance in singing “Rule Britannia.” us, by a
moderate display of quarrelsomeness and ferºcity, we shall really
serve the cause of universal brotherhood and philanthropy; at least,
we shall secure ourselves from that sort of molestation which a saga.
iº dog, by occasional growling, exempts himself from on the part of

AN OFFICER AND (NOT) A GENTLEMAN.
We were lately puzzled by the º among the City
officials there is a Common Huntsman, a Water Bailiff, and a Yeoman
of the Water Side. It has since occurred to our recollection that
these offices are peculiarly appropriate to the city, where the abun-
dance of “Stags” must furnish constant occupation to the Common
Huntsman; while the Water Bailiff and Yeoman of the Water Side,
may be fully employed in looking after the “loose fish” with which
the City swarms.
Advice to Smith O'Brien.
SMITH O'BRIEN is about to receive a free pardon...We are glad of
it; and hope he will collapse into a quiet, Irish landlord. As, how-
ever, PyrāAgoras commanded his disciples to forbear from beans,
º Punch advise SMITH O'BRIEN never again to go among
Cabbages.

Indignant Master of Hounds. “Now, You SIR' MIND THE HouxD !
HE’s worth Forty TIMEs As Much As YoUR HoRSE.”
REASONS FOR BEING PRESENTED AT COURT,
MERE loyalty may be a sufficient inducement with many persons to
be presented at Court, and indeed it requires a pretty good supply of
that amiable feeling to reconcile sensib jià persons to a pair of
footman's breeches, a coat and waistcoat familiarly known to play-goers
as the orthodox dress of Moodle in Tom Thumb–a bag wig which never
goes on the head, a cocked hat that never remains on the head if you
try to put it there, a sword, which is fatal to nothing but your own
dignity by always dangling between your legs, a pair of enormous shoe-
buckles, and a yard or two of lace borrowed from your wife's habit
shirt. ...A man must be very loyal indeed who submits to such mas-
|...} to º his respects to the QUEEN, or it may happen that he
oes so for the less respectable motive of seeing his own name in the
Court Circular.
In looking through the recent list wo find some of the ostensible
reasons given by the Court newsman for certain presentations at Court
to be rather unsatisfactory, and we instance the following in proof of
our statement.
First we find—
* MR.
BEBB, on being allowed by Royal License to take the name of BEBB instead of
LAUREL.”
Now there isn't at any time much in a name, but if we may be
allowed a preference, we should certainly prefer LAUREL to BEBB, and
if we wished to be handed down to posterity in the Court Circular, we
had much rather that instead of §. firſt into the public eye as
BEBB, our fame should be #. by union with LAUREL.
The next presentation which strikes us as rather remarkable in the
reason assigned for it, is that of
*The EARL of PERTH AND MELFord, on restoration.”
We should like to know in what way the Earl has been “restored,”
for “restoration” is a term usually applied to deposed monarchs,
dilapidated pictures, buildings that have been burnt down, and property
that has been stolen. If the Earl has been restored to his title, he
might have reason to rejoice, or if he has been simply restored to
health, the subject º be one for congratulation. But when we are
simply informed that he has been presented “on restoration,” we are
left in a perplexing ambiguity as to what may have been his past fate
as compared with his present condition. -
Qne or two gentlemen have been presented “on their marriage.”
and it is ºf: that a man after he is married, .*. only have his
shirt buttons more complete, but that he may be kept on the whole
more tidy, and consequently more presentable. Several, have gone to
St. James's on the ground of having “obtained a commission,” and it
is certainly a satisfactory achievement, notwithstanding the small
drawback of having been obliged to pay a pretty high price for it.
Nevertheless, we cannot regard the reasons assigned for the presenta-
tions at Court, as on the whole very satisfactory.
EXPORTS FOR THE ENEMY.
To say that a man ought to be hanged, is generally to use a †.
of speech; but if any one crime deserves the gallows it is that of selling
to the enemy the means of destroying our own soldiers. We are sorry
to say that a quantity of gunpowder intended for this murderous traffic
has been :.. but we are glad to add that the quantity so seized was very
large, and we sincerely hope the loss has ruined the owners. It would
be difficult to conceive any punishment too bad for scoundrels who
are capable of turning a penny out of a cartridge intended to kill their
countrymen, if the nineteenth century had not, in a great measure
agreed to abandon the principle of avenging villainous deeds by physi
atrocities. We would not, therefore, wish that such fellows should
be eviscerated, or grilled, or denuded of their integuments in a state of
consciousness—or even subsequently to decease. But we would serve
them conversely as they serve the nation; and since they export
articles for their country’s harm, we would export themselves for their
country’s good—at any price that any customer would pay for such
contemptible slaves.
Consideration on the Oaths Bill.
THE Jews may be a distinct nation; but they do nevertheless take a
great interest in the Commonwealth. If that interest were only the
interest of the Three-per-Cents, it would be something, but the interest
they take is generally very, very much higher than that.

SERMONS IN STONES;
OR, THE MEETING OF THE STATUES.
HE recently promulgated plan
for colouring statues, and the
news that the proprietors of
the Crystal Palace were about
to put the , plan partly, into
execution, have caused the
greatest excitement to prevail
tº: the various statues in
the Metropolis, and made most
of them as vocal as MEMNON
himself. CHARLEs THE FIRST,
whose long “..."; of London smoke
leads him to doubt the durability of any
but a perfectly black tint, has been heard
by many foot-passengers travelling west-
ward from the "Cider Cellars, to exclaim,
“Nimium ne crede colori,” several times in
a sad and solemn tone; but MAJOR CART-
wRIGHT, so long the silent guardian of his
solitary square, is vastly, taken with the
scheme, and has repeate { astonished the
policeman on *; duty, }.º.º. these
words from the Winter's Tale, as if he were
already in possession of all the honours that
polychromatism can bestow.
* Good my lord, forbear;
The ruddiness upon my º is wet,
You'll marit, if you kiss it; stain your own
With oily painting."
But, as most of the Metropolitan statues are as solitary, as milestones,
and as soliloquies, however eloquent, can .*. be expected to
influence public opinion, it was thought better call, a general
meeting of the London Statues for the purpose of considering the
eneraſ fitness and applicability of polychromatism, as an adjunct to
the sculptor's art. - -
The studio of an eminent stone-cutter, situated al fresco, in the New
Road, and containing a great variety of designs both for funereal and
ornamental purposes, was selected as the place, and the hour at which
the statue of the Coºspºrome went to visit Don Juan was fixed on
as the time of meeting. The usual occupants of the stone-cutter's yard
resigned their pedestals, but with no very good grace, to their visitors,
many of whom, and particularly those from St. Paul's Cathedral,
seemed so perfectly at home in their new station, as to greate a stron
suspicion that it had been their birth-place, “A sweet little cherub,
which had long “sat up aloft,” on a fluted column, now squatted in a
corner and looked gloomily at Nelson, who had ousted him of his seat,
having got down from his own column by the aid of the fire-esca
which GeoRGE THE Fourth and CHARLEs the FIRST had fetched for
him out of St. Martin's Lane. PATIENCE, instead of standing on a
monument and “smiling at grief,” had given her place to SHAKspeARE,
and was scowling at him as if she thought he had taken it “not for an age,
but for all time.” The meeting was very numerously attended. Five
or six of the equestrian statues, in their haste to reach it, rode at such

#.
up the City Road as to make it clear that the phrase of “Going
bricks” ought, henceforth, to be superseded as an illustration of
extreme swiftness by that of “Going it like marbles.” CHARLEs THE
FIRST had the lead, the superior breed of his horse ſº him a
decided sº over the reedy, groggy, ewe necked, stiff-kneed
brutes on which his companions were mounted. His riding was much
ired, as he used no stirrups and rode entirely from the knee; but
poor GeoRGE THE THIRD was left along way behind, and came plunging
along, his pigtail vibrating with the violence of the butter and eggs trot
peculiar to the “Berkshire farmer.” . The statue of his son and
successor, which is of a rollicking disposition, greatly alarmed the quiet
inhabitants of Artillery Place by shouting out the well-known lines
from BURGER’s “Leonora.”
“Tramp 1 Tramp 1 we ride along the shore,
Tramp 1 Tramp 1 along the sea,
Hurrah! We statues ride apace,
Dost fear to ride with me?”
The meeting having assembled it was facetiously remarked by several
statues at once, that as SIR. Joseph BANKs, from the British Museum,
was already in the chair, he had better keep it, and the worthy knight
having, entreated that he might not be compelled to speak standing,
proceeded to explain the purpose for which the meeting had been called.
“They had all heard,” he said, “that it was in contemplation to
colour statues, in the hope that the use of flesh tints would give to the
marble the glow and warmth of the human form. At present it was
only proposed to subject the nude antiques to this treatment, but it
must be evident to them all that a white marble coat, with breeches,
stockings, and pumps to match, stood in quite as great need of colour
as the face or the figure. It was impossible to be content with the
use of flesh tints, as it would be simply ridiculous to colour GEORGE
THE THIRD’s face, without at the same time giving to his venerable
igtail that dash of powder which it had wanted for so º §.".
e would not detain the meeting longer, but would conclude §
expressing a hope that the painter's brush would soon endow him wit
a ... nankeen breeches, a canary waistcoat embroidered
with lace, white stockings, and shoes with buckles: a neat and elegant
costume which he had worn during life, and which he much preferred
to his present dress, which was fit only for a miller.”
AcHILLEs from Hyde Park then came forward and moved the first
resolution, thus:–
*Sorely it grieveth my soul, O my friends, thus to stand up before you,
Blackened with soot and with smoke from this highly fuliginous city,
Liker to MEMNON I seem than to him whom the white-footed THETIs
Bare unto PELEUs the Qld, nor would THETIs remember her offspring.
Therefore I hail with deſight the proposal to paint me, believing
That he whom º paint must each year, or more often, be washed or
re-painted.
Thus shall I cease to be like unto Thomas, that just Ethiopian: .
Therefore I move that the project be quickly embraced by the meeting.”
AçHILLEs ceased, and DR. JoHNson, from St. Paul's, stepping for.
ward to second the resolution, said:—
., “Man is so far the slave of form and custom, that he can have no
idea of the appearance of his fellow man apart from the accessories of
dress, nor can he . the general, the monarch, or the author, from
the uniform, the robes, or the rags, with which fashion or fate have
covered them. Were # able to transfer to the canvas or the marble
the exact lineaments of PIATO's face, you could not expect the philo-
; to be recognised if you adorned his figure with the theatrical
habiliments of Joseph GRiMALDI; nor would the features of my
revered monarch (here GeoRGE THE THIRD bowed) be known for his
own under the helmet of Richard THE LIONHEARTED. And it must
be evident to all who have studied the pages of history, that I cannot
convey by any means a correct impression of the man whom I am
intended to represent, The coat unconscious of a brush, the breeches
too sparingly endowed with buttons, the linen unsparingly besprinkled
with snuff, and º other well-known characteristics of the man, are
wanting in me, and I sigh for the time when the painter shall endow
me with those peculiarities, without which I can only deceive the
ignorant and disappoint the wise.”
It was next moved by the statue of Actaeon, from the Museum, and
seconded by CHARLEs THE, FIRST, that in the development of the
new plan the colouring of all dogs and horses should be confided to
SIR. Edwin LANDSFER and to no other artist. A slight disturbance
was created by the Boy with the Basket, from Pannier Alley, who had
understood that azure was the colour chiefly employed in decorating
works of his class, and who thought that the new process would there.

A Flash in the Hebrew Pan.
QN Wednesday, MR. HENRY DRUMMOND presented a petition from
a MR. FLAsHMAN, of Dover, “praying. Her Majesty's Ministers to
take immediate measures for restoring the Jews to their own land.”
What does this mean? We always understood that the Jews were

been a falling out? Are honest men likely to come by their own?

KALAFAT AT ANY PRICE.

“common THINGs.”
Fully agreeing with LoRD AshBURTON and the Times that a
knowledge of “common things” is now uncommonly desirable, we
benevolently intend º to the subject an inch or two of our
always, “valuable space.”. Our own experience has long since taught
us, and that of any “oldest inhabitant” will, we think, confirm the
lesson, that—
It is a common thing for the conductor of a Brixton omnibus to
assert that he can put you down “within an 'underd yards or so.” of
your residence at Bayswater.
It is a common thing for those who purchase at a draper's “selling
off,” to find that they themselves are included in the selling.
it is a common thing for “sporting cards” to turn up knaves when
you deal with them.
t is a common thing when you see an “original” farce announced,
to find by the papers it’s “adapted from the French.”
It is a common thing for tax-collectors to learn when they call on him
that “master's just stepped out.”
It is a common thing when you are asked to go shopping with your
wife, to find that she puts on her very oldest bonnet.
It is a common thing for gentlemen who don't feel well after a wine
party, to attribute their nausea entirely to the nuts.
It is a common thing for cabmen to drive you circuitously, alleging
as areason that the “streets are up.”
It is a common thing for Cockney yachtsmen, when yielding to the
elements, to assert that they never felt better in their lives.
t is a common thing for men who “won't detain you five minutes”
to hold you by the button-hole for upwards of an hour.
It is a common thing for “real Norfolk sausages” to be manufac-
tured in Whitechapel.
And it is a common thing on your returning suddenly from town, to
find nothing in the house but a picked bone and a policeman.
Cabby. “What is it as is meant by “Common Things, as the Nobs is all
for teachin' of us now?"
Waterman. “Why they tell me its Cabbiography and Bussiology, and all
such things as belong to Civil Conveyancing.”
St. Petersburg Theatre.
It is said that Nicholas—who has some talent for melodrama,
which comes out during his paroxysms—delivered himself, on taking
leave of the Quakers, of the following speech:-‘You have shaken the
hand of the EMPEROR of Russia, but you have not shaken his reso:
lution!” With these words, which were accompanied by a flourish of
the fist and a stamp on the floor, the Autocrat made his exit.
The TRUTH or TEN LURKs IN A PARApox.-Any fool can make
money, but it requires a clever man to spend it.
THE MACBETH MUSEUM.
The Morning Chronicle, which appears to keep a correspondent in
every benighted and uncivilised place in the world, has just published
a letter from Scotland, in which it is stated, that
“Excavations were made in the course of last week at the supposed site of Macbeth's
Castle at Dunsinane, in Perthshire; after removing rubbish for some three feet, awaii
was discovered, composed of largestones neatly joined together, and resting on the
rock; but, beyond some charcoal and a few bones, no relics were discovered: the inves-
tigations will be proceeded with.”
We are happy to state that Scotch perseverance was rewarded, and
that, after some days digging, the following articles, in tolerable
preservation, were found.
The rattle and, coral of the baby Lady Macbeth speaks of, as one
; Nº. she had been a good deal attached, and did not bring up
y hand.
. The goblet Macbeth let fall when he saw the Ghost—rim a good deal
indented, and the vessel still smelling of whiskey.
The pedigree of “Mark, King of Scotland,” mentioned early in the
play, and hitherto supposed to have been a fabulous sovereign.
The ring Duncan sent to Lady Macbeth as a small token of respect
and esteem for her cookery. Note:-This present did not prevent the
lady from causing the royal goose to be added to the articles cooked
that day, but as the stones in the ring appear to be only Scotch pebbles,
there is some excuse for her. -
The bell, her Ladyship struck when her husband's drink was ready.
It is slightly cracked, but, as she mentions that she had also mixed for
herself she probably struck hard, in the excitement of the moment.
It is delightful to see H. prescience corroborated by physical facts.
Several bottles of the º which, by order of Macbeth, was thrown
to the dogs. As the skeletons of some canine victims were found near
the spot, it is probable that the Doctor was the MoRRISON of his day,
and that it was as well that the Macbeth family did not take his
medicines. -
The number of the Sun published on the last day of the siege of
Dunsimane Castle. The ift. of its contents (this was some years
ago, and the jour; al has vastly improved since), perfectly justifies
Macbeth's observation, that he “began to be aweary” of the publication
in question. -
Other relics will probably turn up. Meantime the Managers of the
London Theatres are on the qui vice to secure the above articles for
a revival of the play. In the hopes of obtaining them, MR. CHARLEs
KEAN is already writing a learned and voluminous fly leaf to his play-
bill, while the Yankee Gentleman, who spoiled the Corsican Brothers
for Drury Lane, is composing a beautiful scene between Lady Macbeth,
her baby, and the nurse—another, introducing King Mark-and a third,
in which Lady Macbeth exultingly brews the grog for her husband,
with which and other American additions the play will last until a
quarter to three in the morning. We shall duly announce the successful
competitor for the MACBETH Museum.
ONE OF THE KNAWES OF THE CHURCH.
We should recommend the reader to put everything fragile out of
his way, to protect it against the violence of the outburst of indignation
which we think must attend theWººl of the following advertisement
which appeared recently in the Times:-
"O SOLICITORS AND GUARDIANS.–20 per cent. commission on the
half-yearly account, as long as the pupil remains, will be given by a clergyman
near London, and receiving a limited number of YOUNG GENTLEMEN, who are
treated with every possible kindness. Terms 60 guineas per annum, besides extras.
No objection to lower terms; but in that case the rate of commission would be smaller.
An Articled Pupil Wanted. Apply by letter, with real name and address to A.B.C.,
care of, &c.
So, here is a clergyman holding out a bait to solicitors and guardians
to join in a scheme to obtain money under the false, pretence that he
has made a fair charge for º; a º: and the solicitor or
guardian is to obtain money under the false pretence that the sum
aid is the amount required to obtain the advantage of the clergyman's
F. One would be curious to see the sort of moral teaching that
prevails in the establishment of the clergyman who has actually a new
wrinkle to propose to the members of a profession who, justly, or, not,
have the credit of being at the bottom of at least one half of all the
rascality in Christendom. When a clergyman proposes to suggest a
new dodge to an attorney, we are reminded of the fabled effort of a
grandson to give instruction to his grandmother in the art of sucking
eggs. Here, however, we have even a stronger case, for we find a
son of the Church teaching the attorney or agent of the grandfather
of lies how to suck the estate of an heir, or the pocket of a parent.

DELIGHT OF ONE OF OUR GUARDs Now HE [FEELs TBAT THE Countby WILL PROTECT
“THE Glal HE LEAVES BEBIND HIM.”
THE WALUE OF A GENTLEMAN.
If the Admirable CRICHTON were to throw himself on the market in
the present day, we fear that he would prove to beinvery little demand,
at a very low figure. The attributes of CRIchton were never of the
most negotiable kind, and though we have been assured that “everyman
has his price,” we fear the price of mere accomplishments would be
wretchedly low, when the business qualities of the human machine are
estimated at the paltry sum set forth in the following advertisement:
AW-WANTED in a London Office, A GENTLEMAN possessing a
thorough knowledge of Common Law according to the present practice, a general
knowledge of Chancery proceedings, a facility in Correspondence, and general steadi-
ness and industry. The Salary is proposed to commence at £80 a year, to increase
according to application and ability. A Bond with Two Sureties to the amount of £500
will be required as Security. Address to X. L. &c.
To sum up the qualifications required by this advertisement, we find
that for £80 a year, the advertiser expects a BROUGHAM's knowledge
9f Common Lºw, a KNIGHT, BRUCE's familiarity with Chancery, a
CHESTERFIELD's adroitness at letter-writing, and a Whittington's
steadiness and industry. . Besides all these qualities there must be
added, in a minor degree, the responsibility of a Rothschild, inasmuch
as security to a large amount will be required. It is true there is a
Y. prospect of an increase to the §. sed remuneration, but as this
will depend on “application and ability,” and as the maximum of both
these attributes is expected on taking the situation, we do not see how
there can be room for any, additional “application and ability” on
which to found a hope of additional salary.
The best we can º for the advertiser in this instance is, that he
may be inundated with applicants professing to do all that is desired
for the sum proposed, and that the party selected may very speedily do
rather more than he bargains for, by doing the principal; who will thus
be made to purchase a knowledge of the fact, that liberality is after all
the wisest economy.

bulwark with some additional ten-pounders.

LOCKSMITHS AT LOGGERHEADS.
. A CoNTRoversy-by means of advertisement
in the Times—has been for some time going on
between certain rival locksmiths; the question
wherein appears to be, whether they have or
have not, succeeded in picking one another's
locks. The species of dexterity for the of
which these parties have been contending, is
one. that most, people, perhaps, would rather
rejoice in the silent consciousness of, than be so-
licitous to obtain for it an amount of notoriety,
not exactly identical with reputation. It might
also be expected that such a discussion would be
conducted on either side with the calmness of
philosophers who have rendered themselves ex-
pert in thieves' tricks for the purpose of -
thieves. On the contrary, however, it is carried
on with extreme acrimony and animosity, accom-
panied by reciprocal imputations of unfairness
and fraud. W **.* these ingenious gentle-
men pick the locks one of another without also
picking holes in each other's coats? Their pre:
sumably common object, the advertisement of
their respective articles, would be better pro-
moted if they, could manage to divest their
arguments on both sides of personalities cal-
culated to suggest a doubt how far either can be
depended upon.

CULLEN ON CAPERS.
THE progress which Popery has been making in the exclusive
circles, will probably sustain a severe check from, the publication ºf
the following extract from ARCHBishop CUILEN’s “Lenten Pastoral,
which, according to the Times, was read at all the chapels in Dublin, on
the Sunday before last:-
“Never engage in those improper dances imported from other countries, and
retaining foreign names, such as polkas and waltzes, which are so repugnant to the
notions of strict Christian morality, are eondemned by many of the highest and most
respectable members of society, and are at direct variance with that Purity and
modesty of the female character for which Ireland has ever been distinguished.
The Protestant Association should get a few thousand copies of the
above extract printed, and distribute them in Belgravia. . If the
superior classes—who have always been accustomed to regard Popery
as a religion of taste and elegance—can be made, aware that it con-
demns la danse, they will be much more effectually disgusted with it
than they ever will by being informed that it condemned LATIMER and
RIDLEY. Instead of telling them that it excommunicated QUEEN
ELIZABETH, let them know that it anathematises CELLARIUs, if you want
to convince them that it is a “horrid” religion. Teach them that it
not only enjoins occasional abstinence from meat (which may improve
the complexion), but also prescribes, perpetual fasting from the
još. and the Redowa, and the Walse à deux Temps. By the
very mouth of the Pope's own mouthpiece in Ireland, instruct them
that it calls these exquisite, these fascinating, these bewitching exhi-
bitions of the poetry of motion, “improper dances imported from other
countries and retaining foreign names.” Do not waste words to
demonstrate to them that it fastens, fetters upon manly reason, and
impedes the progress of the human mind. No, convince them that it
shackles feminine ankles, and restrains the graceful movements of the
female form. Then you may be sure that they will abandon the idea
that there is what they call “soul” in its devotion. You will satisfy
them that it is a dull, cold, hard system, as strict and as stupid as any
species of Methodism. In short—that the Church of CARDINAL
ISEMAN is as disagreeable and as vulgar as the Church of STIGGINs.

HOW TO ENDURE
WAR-TAXES.
To bombard and bat-
ter the disturber of the
peace of Europe, it is
necessary... that we
should all shell out,
and come down with
the shot.
The effort, of shel.
ling or pulling out
money is attended with
pain. It may be com-
pared to having a tooth
out. In fact, KING
= John's Jew allowed
several of his teeth to
be extracted before he
would pull out his
money.

| cessitated by war

º, to under the influence
*" of chloroform. But
§ chloroform produces
; insensibility; andwhen
Britons paytheir taxes,
* they like to know what
they are about; There
#! is the same objection
to brandy and water.
The only possible sub-
stitute for chloroform is Moral Philosophy, which often has a highly narcotic effect. It is
oped, however, that the following considerations may prove consolatory without being
somniferous. -
In paying your war-taxes, recollect that you are only defraying an extraordinary police
rate, necessitated for the protection of the community inst a monstrous burglar, and
hope that you are contributing to the rascal's apprehension and punishment. Or, bear in
mind that your taxes are only so much money extended in the way of fire insurance against
a dangerous incendiary or SwiNG. . -
Think that the coin you surrender will be transmuted by the Government into ammunition;
so that it will, in effect, form a portion of bombshells and cannon-shot which may actually
blow the palace of the old robber about his ears. perhaps enter into the substance of a bullet
or a bayonet, destined to finish the work which the shells and the larger shot may leave
undone.
. Comfort yourself, at all events, with the assurance that your cash will be converted
into weapons of oftence and destruction, to be wielded against the Tyrant with all our
might, and all our soul, and all our strength

has been known to walk up and down a pastrycook's for half-an-hour before he has dared
go in to ask for a penny bun. At an evening party, he drinks lemonade, or orangeade,

it is milk, or ginger-beer. Beer he sets his lips against entirely, as, in his refined opinion,
it tends to grossness... He contributes to Ladies' Albums, collects autographs, writes
acrostics, and is indefatigable in his exertions if a young lady should want half a million

cannot sit with his back to his horses. It makes him giddy to waltz. He hands the muffins

a pic-nic take place without a man who parted his hair down the middle)—for he runs, for
the plates, cleans the knives and forks, fetches the spring water, and does a number of little
useful offices whilst the other gentlemen are quietly seated down upon the grass eating their

:
THE FRIENDS' REAL SCENE WITH THE CZAR.
ToTALLY incorrect account of
the interview between the
Quaker deputation and the
EMPEROR of Russia having
been published, we subjoin
the following, wherein our
usual accuracy may be de-
pended on.
The three Friends walked
into the Imperial, presence
with their hatson their heads,
and remained covered when
they got there.
Then the spokesman de-
a livered this address:-
“Nicholas Romanoff,
Emperor of all the Russias.
We come before thee, deputed
by the Society of Friends, of
which we are members, re-
spectfully to beseech thee to
withdraw the provocation
whereby thou art in the way
to cause a European war.
ln addressing this entreaty
to thee, we trust that thou
wilt consider us warranted
by thy profession of the
Christian religion, which forbiddeth all warfare:
“We are further moved by the information that thou hast called on
thy subjects to take up arms for the express purpose of protecting the
Greeks, under the dominion of the Sultan, in the exercise, of that
religion, which is a religion that not only doth not require, but dis-
claimeth the protection of soldiers. - -
“Thou knowest that war hath for its direct aim the slaughter of
human beings by piercing them with bullets, crushing and tearing them
with bombshells and cannon-balls, cutting and stabbing them with
swords, lances, and bayonets, and by other cruel and barbarous means
putting them to death. Also that it causeth the burning of ships and
towns, and the infliction of the most dreadful and atrºcious outrages
on the inhabitants of the hostile countries, succeeded in general by
pestilence and famine. We ask thee to reflect that these are not the
right means for defending the cause of Christians. -
“Moreover, we desire to call thy attention to the fact, that war is
not only inconsistent with Christianity, but also with commerce, and
in thy case will materially affect the corn trade, in which both thyself
and many of us are largely interested, besides doing great mischief to
thy business in tallow, hides, tar, pitch, hemp, and hog's bristles.
‘We therefore exhort and implore thee to withdraw thy troops
from the Danubian º and thus save Europe the calamities
wherewith it is threatened by thy present policy, and preserve thy own
soul from responsibility for them.”
Whereunto the Autocrat replied:—
“Gentlemen, Considering that you know I have the power, and
may reasonably doubt whether I have not also the will, to order **
all three to be knouted to death, in approaching me with such a
message as you have just delivered, I confess I admire your courage-
which is the more remarkable that you are men of peace. But at the
same time, I am astonished at your impudence.
“You come here to teach me Christianity. What do you know
about the matter? You are dissenters from Protestantism. Protes-
tants are seceders from the Latin Church. The Latin Church is
heterodox. Thus you are heretics three times removed.
“I am the supreme head of the Orthodox Church. I am the great
teacher of Christianity. I gave the Turks a practical lesson at Sinope.
After that, I caused my priests to sing “Te Deum laudamus,” a hymn
on a sacrifice. What, then, are you telling me to think of myself, in
coolly proposing to me your ideas of Christianity?
“The only reply that I can condescend to give to your monstrous
presumption, is by my mouth unutterable. There is, I believe, a
vulgar word in your language, which signifies a particular piece of
bacon. Understand my answer to be contained in that.
“In return for your ºbliging attempt to teach me Christianity, how-
ever, I will, if you like, teach it to you. Heretics of heretics of
heretics! go and get christened by my ARCHI-ARCHI-ARCHI-vey.
“In the meanwhile, to show you that º not among my
failings, and that I am not proud—here is my han
The Friends did not take the sanguinary hand. All three shrank
back from it with horror. The Emperor, with palm extended, followed
them around.the presence-chamber, laughing, whilst they retreated
backing as if from a red-hot poker. His Majesty ascribed their refusal
to shake hands with him to the same merely conscientious scruple
which caused them to retain their hats; and, giving up his gracious
overture, called in the Empress to show her his visitors, whose costume
and appearance afforded her infinite diversion.
A TAX ON BACHELORS,
It has been suggested, as one of the best means of raising a fund for
...; on the war, to put a tax on Bachelors. Few but the parties
themselves will object to this arrangement, though it proceeds on the
ungallant supposition that married men find a wife a sufficient tax
without any additional burden. -
We hope that if the Bachelor Tax should be º will be in
the shape of an ad valoren duty, and that every Bachelor will be
allowed to fill up his own form of assessment of his Yº...ºf
to his own estimate. There need be no fear that any surcharges wi
have to be made by the Commissioners, for it is reasonable to expect
that the valuation, if made by the parties themselves, will touch the
Inaximum.
We know several Bachelors who put such price on their perfection
ºf form, that they are sure to set themselves at a very considerable
º There are many also who have expended vast sums in aspecies
of self-culture that has, in their own opinion, added greatly to the sum
at which they ought to be rated. We have heard of a casein which a
moustache has been raised by a large outlay on a somewhat barren and
unpromising field, and this process, which may be called, the “high
farming” of the upper lip, is supposed to increase the “permanent
value” of the spot where it has been adopted.
Personal appearance is frequently a chief part of the fortune of a
Bachelor, who regards a handsome face as equivalent to an estate;
and if he preserves the hairs on that estate, he believes that he adds
ºnly to its worth should he have to go with it into the matrimonial
market.
We have a Bachelor acquaintance who has devoted half a life to his
eyebrow, which he estimates at five thousand pounds, and he is
seriously thinking of giving up the remainder of his days to a
which is at present in a most unpromising state of stubble. If an
ad valorem duty were to be levied on this enthusiast's estimate of
himself, the proceeds would be nearly enough to support a whole
regiment, for he places a very high valuation on the “growing *: --
which cover the “face of Nature,”—as he complacently terms the face
with which Nature has-either well or ill-favoured him.
all means let us have a Bachelor Tax, but let every Bachelor be
at liberty to assess himself; so that however much he may be rated
above his real worth, he will never suspect that he could have over-
burden.

S it fur to Jerusalem P
What pilgrim is it asks this
touching question? Who is he

Land P Doth he carry the cockle-
shell in his hat? Doth he grasp
a staff of cruciform * I)oth he
wear the pilgrim's simple weed f
Doth he carry the º scripp
º In all the solemnity of truth-seek-
Bºº ing, it is asked, Who is it seeks
to know how far the way to sacred
Jerusalem P It is a Pilgrim of
St. Nicholas. Young he was,
and almost as innocent as the
sheep, whose fleece was to him
as one sole garment; happy,
thoughtless, frisking he was, as
Tartar lamb in its first May
month's life; dirty he was, and
happy in his dirt as wild boar's
wild pig; when there came a
voice to his village, saying, ‘Let
PETER become even as a Pilgrim
of St. NICHOLAs, and prepare
himself to journey to Jerusalem.”
Now, PETER was content, to
remain , where Providence had
dropped him. True it is the
Priests had talked to him of
Jerusalem, and, scratching his
head, much confused by a singing
therein, as of theyoices of spirits;
dazzled too, as § the light o
holy fires, PETER had a strange
whirling, dizzying notion of this
still fain to wear his old, and by this time, populous
sheepskin, and to remain in the village, of which he was even earth of its earth. -
There were strange stories told of this Jerusalem, a place far up, up, up, and surely getting
.# nigh to heaven. Strange stories of goodness and grace, and everlasting mercy, tº man,
and all this seemed strange, perplexing to PETER, for he had heard, from his childhood
upwards, the thwack of the stick, he had more than once heard the death (crack) of the
knout screaming like a vulture for the victims' vitals. Nevertheless, he would rather rest
where, he was, he would rather not go to Jerusalem. --- - -
And then the Priest from his pulpit tells terrible tidings of the wickedness done in
Jerusalem. Old men howl, young women sob, and beldames tear their hair, monsters of Turks
-two-legged, dogs, no better—defile the Holy Places. The Sultan sends his mule from
Constantinople to drink from out the Holy Manger, and Calvary is ploughed by the infide!
plough, and sown by the sons of opium with poppy seed; and again the gld men grººn, and
the old women shriek anew. Butlet PETER rejoice and bless himself, for the elders of
the illº in obedience to the sacred Czar, have chosen PETER with some score or two of
others, old familiar playmates, to go to Jerusalem, Nevertheless, PETER would fain tarry
where he is. PETER is obdurate, rebellious, but there is the stick—the ruling, genius of
Russia, and PETER for the five hundredth time in his life, is black, and likewise blue. And
PETER, his legs and arms bound by his native hemp, is flung into a cart to become a soldier.
Here, as it sometimes happens to calves on their way to become veal, PETER hears his father
howl and his mother scream for the last time, for he goes jolting onwards to Jerusalem, and
from the depths of his trouble arises this question, Is it far to Jerusalem . --- - -
At length, shorn of his sheepskin, PETER becomes a pilgrim in uniform, and with his
scrip of bullets, is sent towards Jerusalem, and still he marches and marches—the deliverer
of the Holy Places; and still getting nearer and nearer, he asks of every new people, Is it
far to Jerusalem? - - - - -
For the last time he opens his mouth, and a Turkish bullet gives him satisfying answer;
PETER has arrived at Jerusalem. Good Christians all, your prayers for the thousands an
thousands of pilgrims bound to St. Nicholas—and now in morass, marsh, and quagmire
faintly gasping, “Is it far from Jerusalem P’’
Jerusalem. Nevertheless, PETER was
“BARRY, COME UP.”—Indignant Elizabethan, with a cold.
. CYPRIAN, or perhaps it was ORIGEN, it doesn't much matter, for most likely the story
is utterly, false-lived nineteen, years in one chamber, and took so little notice of it, that
at the end of that time he could not describe its shape, or say how many windows it had.
SIR CHARLEs BARRY's architectural creations lay a much firmer hold upon those who dwell
.# them, and actually force the officers of the Houses to adopt an antiquated style of
speech, more in accordance with the forms and ornaments around them, than is the flippant
talk of the day. Quotations from SHAKESPEARE and the Elizabethan dramatists, are quite
the household words in the New Palace. For instance, no official ever thinks of asking
another, “Who is speaking in the House of Commons?” but, if he wishes for that inform-
ation, demands with Macbeth—
*'''Who Lies in the Second Chamber? .
A CRACKED HEAD IN A CROWN.
LEARN, by the case of that old brute,
The Czar, with pride gone mad,
The monarchy that’s absolute
Is absolutely bad.
He in his bonnet has a bee,
To use a Scottish phrase,
Which doth around his ears, you see,
A nest of hornets raise.
His head is turned—but on that pate
Is fixed the Russian crown,
And, turning with it, turns the state
Completeſy upside down.
His reason from its seat is hurled,
Whilst he retains his throne,
Thus the derangement of the world
Arises from his own.
How many roofs, through one loose slate,
Are likely to be sacked;
Of broken heads a sum how great
Will come of one that’s cracked :
War on us all one man's insane
Determination draws,
Determination to the brain,
Considered in its cause.
Life's tide in many a fight will flow,
Poured out in many a flood,
'Twere bloodshed saved if he would go
And lose a little blood.
If from unhealthy bile proceed
The despot's mental ill
Thousands, perhaps, are doomed to bleed,
Because he wants a pill.
O nations ! to the fact attend,
Which cannot be denied
The state of Europe may depend
On that of his inside.
Let this reflection, borne in mind,
The firm resolve inspire
To give him physic, of the kind
Such lunatics require.
PICTORIAL STATUES.
THE Morning Post, complains of a fashion
which is becoming prevalent in sculpture; that
of colouring statues—helping out the chisel with
the paintbrush. Tastes, however, differ, and some
connoisseurs may consider that the works of the
sculptor are improved by painting; although the
opinion of others may be that he had better
confine his attempts to the creation of beauties
without paint. The former class of dilettanti
may confidently deny, that the practice com-
d|plained of by the Post is, as our contemporary
says, an innovation. Not to mention the glaring
proofs to the contrary which are to be seen in
every toyshop window, the antiquity of embel-
lishing works of plastic art is ãº,
everybody who steps into Guildhall by the glori-
ous hues with which the old Civic fancy has
adorned GoG and MAGOG.
Increase of the Police Force.
THERE was talk of an increase of the Police
Force, but a lady assures us that there is not
the least necessity for this addition, for she has
remarked that, in the vicinity of the barracks,
the policemen have increased considerably, as a
body, *:::: all grown much stouter ever since
the Guards left London.

MACAULAY'S “IVRY,”
AND Declaims the Poext to A Prosaic Party.

Prosaic Party (interrupting). Hullo!
Our Artist. Ehº
Prosaic Party. Why, hang it, that’s only one spur a-piece
AN ACTING MEMBER.
We observe that a gentleman, named PALK, against whom we know nothing
worse than that he is a Member of Parliament, has just been solemnising his
election % º some dramatic performances, in which he took a share,
and to which he admitted not º his aristocratic friends, but “the trades-
men of the vicinity.” ...We should like to see the playbill, as we confess that,
* unhappily familiar with the British Drama, we should find it difficult
to select a set of pieces appropriate to such an occasion. Memory, prodded
by ill-nature, of course suggests a few common place sarcasms, and #. at
3. ſº Quo, the Apostate, hanted a Place, and similar unjust impertinencies,
but these we should scorn to write down. But it occurs to us as possible
that MR. PALK may have chosen to illustrate his intended Parliamentary
career to his constituents after the manner of the “Grecian Statues,” once
so popular, Perhaps he dressed himself in tight “fleshings,” and, getting
upon a table. went into the following attitudes, to the sound of striking music.
MR. Palk as he appeared taking the oaths, adding a terrific
bang on the Speaker's table as he defied the Pope and all his
works.
Ditto as he appeared taking his seat courteously, but man-
fully, and in a manner accordant with the true pricciples of
the Constitution.
Ditto, as he appeared crying “Hear!”
Ditto, as he appeared presenting a petition, and bounding
gracefully therewith to the clerk of the carpet-bag.
Ditto as he appeared trying to catch the Speaker's eye.
Ditto trying another attitude.
Ditto trying a third attitude.
Ditto, suddenly dropping his hat, in the hope that this
would arrest Mr. Speaker's attention.
Ditto, suddenly unbuttoning his coat and displaying a very
glittering waistcoat, with the same view,
Ditto shouting, yet insinuatingly, at the Speaker.
Ditto, beginning with a kind of spasmodic pop, eminently
calculated to attract notice.
Ditto, having tried all these devices of young, and green
Members in vain, and being continually defeated by the ruse
º Commoner, waiting quietly until Mr. Speaker sees fit to
see Illin.
Ditto (being called by name) as he appeared rising and
saving his country.
Ditto, as he appeared next morning when perusing the
H. and finding that he is made to save his country in four
ines and a half. -
Ditto, resigning his seat and resuming those bucolic engage-
ments which befit every true Englishman.
Now, if this was anything like the series of performances
with which Mr. Paik regaled his constituents, we can only
say, in perfect ignorance of that gentleman's other merits,
that it betokened an originality which bids well for his success
in the House of Commons, and on the bare hypothesis we
feel half inclined to look out for his speeches.
A Thought at an Election Committee.
It must be confessed that nowhere does England appear
to less advantage than at her Election Committees! Such
a mass of meanness, trickery, bribery, corruption, perjury,
of everything that is base and blackguard, as to make an
Englishman ashamed of his own, countrymen You would
not believe that Englishmen could have n guilty of such
ractices... We hope that no foreigner ever looks into those
rightful blue-books, for if the national character were to be
drawn from the evidence that is contained in them, how hope.
lessly black we should appear in the eyes of the world!
A Gigantic Change.
The spirit of democracy has entered into that stronghold
of conservatism and corruption, the City Corporation. hen
Gog and Magog are knocked of their pedestals, as soon they
must be, they will be thrown º the wide world, and not
know what to do for a living. They may follow the example
of other Conservatives, who have jumped down from the great
height of their original position and mingled with the ranks
of the people, and we may yet witness the strange fact of
Gog and Magog turning demagogues.
Nicholas IIIMself.
Nicholas, worshipped as the God of the Russians, has
been acting like the very Nicholas—the great Pretender.
He sent ORLoff to tempt Austria and Prussia. Of a truth
Nicholas is Nicholas, and ORLorf is his angel.
Save us from our Friends.
In his reply to the Peace Deputation the EMPEROR or
Russia declared his sentiments to be in perfect conformity
with those of the Society of Friends... We cannot doubt the
sincerity of this assertion, for when the Czar sees all Europe
§º: against him it is natural that he should become a
er.
An up AND Down train or THOUGHT.
THERE is an up and down train of thought, which not un-
frequently ends in a railway collision, an that is when an
irascible gentleman in a carriage insists upon having the win-
dow “up,” and another irascible gentlemaninsists upon having
it “down.”

SUICIDE OF THE SEWERS.
THE neighbourhood of Greek Street, has been in a state of great
excitement, in consequence of a report that the sewers had put an end
to their existence by a deliberate act of suicide, . On inquiring at the
office of the Commission the rumour, was found to be—we can't say,
too true—but true enough. The body which has just terminated its
own existence has for some time led a very useless and, unsatisfactory
life, which had long been regarded as a burden, not only to itself, but
to those who were heavily taxed by its extravagance. It has long been
felt that it would be a mercy to put out of its misery a body which has
long ceased to be regarded with any other feeling than one of contempt,
and the H. be delighted to hear that the body itself has at last
struck the decisive blow which every one has been reluctant to give,
though, desirous to see inflicted. A letter, from the Home Office,
intimating to the Board its utter inefficiency, had the effect of touching
one of the members that happened, to have some consciousness left,
. member gave the suicidal blow of which the body has happily

- #. is no doubt that the Commission, in laying violent hands on
itself, has only anticipated, § a º short time, the fate that was in
store for it. Our only wonder is that it should have lived—or been
allowed to live—so long, and we are rejoiced that by administering to
itself its own quietus it spared the Home Secretary the unpleasant-
ness of performing the office of executioner. We should have been
sorry to have j. PALMERstoN compelled to stain his honourable
han which has now been shed by an act of most
in that ºlº -
exemplary suicide. e only difficulty now will be to find a dustman
sufficiently dead to all sensibility to take away the ashes.
AN ART-TRUTH.—No woman ever knows how handsome she is

THE POET IN PARLLAMENT.
CoME, twine me a chaplet the brows to adorn
Of the Colonel, whose eloquence playfully gushes
From under moustaches, whose wildness would scorn
The teeth of the comb or the print of the brushes.
And recollect, that the man I sing
Hates humbug with aversion hearty )
So a wreath of many colours bring,
Combining all but the hue of party.
They say of debate he’s the standard buffoon,
And ſaints with absurdity all that he touches;
They hint that he’s Parliament's own Pantaloon,
With twaddle and wholesale abuse for his crutches.
You’ll see at once the kind of thing
For a chaplet I need; so, quick, prepare it,
And into the air a foolscap fling
To light on the head that’s fit to wear it.
MONASTERIES UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.
If Roman Catholic ceremonies are imposing, Roman Catholic
statistics appear also calculated to impose upon us... We must
take care how we believe them—if we are to believe LoRD
E. HowARD. That noble lord, in deprecating inquiry concerning
convents and monasteries, is reported to have said–
“The honourable member, too, had quite a misconception as to the numbers
of females in the convents; any one would suppose from the honourable
gentleman's language, that all the 75 convents were crowded with melancholy
prisoners, whereas he himself (Lond E. Howard) happened to know that
in one of them there were but three inmates, in another but four, and in
another but seven; and he believed the same description would apply to
a great many of the rest. The fact was that, whenever two or three ladies
united together for the purposes of education or charity in a locality, the
editor of the Catholic Almanack forthwith registered them as an additional
convent.”
This exaggeration seems to be a sort of pious fraud, in-
tended !. the motion that Popery is spreading.
The piety of the Catholic Almanack is per yº not the less
orthodox for being fraudulent. It is a sort of piety that has
always tended to magnify monastic institutions.
SUBJECT FOR A PABLE.
That naughty little boy, the EMPEROR NIcholas, seeing
the reflection of the moon, in the shape of a Crescent, in the

POOR. RICHARD COEUR DE LION.
T has been suggested that
the space in front of West-
minster Hall and the chief
entrance of the House of
Commons is not an ap-
§. site for BARON
MARochETTI's statue of
RICHARD COEUR DE LION;
and certainly a statue of

that of the Lion-hearted

Considering the nature
of the excitement which
occasioned the Holy Wars,
the fittest place for the re-
resentative of the Royal
rusader will perhaps be
decided, by the majority
of people, to be the front of Bethlehem Hospital-an institution
which would have been an extremely proper one for the accommoda-
tion of those heroes who showed their devotion to the shrine of that
name by destroying their fellow men. If, however, it should be thought
that too extreme a view of the crusading state of mind, would be
eyinced by the connection of Coeur DE LION's image with Bedlam,
MARøgh ETTI's work of art might anyhow be erected in proximity to

cessary to attractive action, but which have either been. denied by
Nature or lost through time or accident. An important influence is
also exerted by the eyes, which occasionally give off sparks that inflame
combustible individuals. Considering the body as an electrical machine,
the most eligible form is not the cylindrical, still less the circular; a
certain contraction of the waist is preferred; and some human elec-
trical machines of the softer sex, with power sufficient to electrify a
whole ball-room, exhibit a conformation resembling that of an hour-glass.
The apparatus should be fixed on a pair of legs, which ought to be
straight and of a moderate thickness, if it is one of the male kind:

prove the stool of repentance.
A NEW REFORM BILL FOR OMNIBUSES.
WF wish MR. FITzRoy, or some good pushing propelling member,
would put his shoulder to the wheel of public conveyances, and try to
pass through the two Houses a new “Reform Bill for Omnibuses,”—
one that should contain some of the following dreadfully-needed
iº. - -
That there should be sufficient room inside to enable, a passenger to
gain his seat, without having to force his way through an entangled
º: of knees, or to clear a path through a close crop of umbrellas
and LOCs.
That the space of each seat should be portioned off, as in the French
omnibuses, by means, of wooden rails, so making each seat a comfort-
able arm-chair, in order that each passenger may enjoy his own, share
of room—neither encroaching upon his neighbour's space, nor allowing
his neighbour, which is too frequently the case, to encroach upon his.
That there should be a strap running under the roof, or some means
by which a passenger may work along, easily, to his allotted seat, with-
out being subject to the unpleasantness of being jerked into a lady's
lap, or having to clutch hold of a passenger's nose, or any other human
dle in an omnibus in case of sudden helplessness.
That no conductor should be allowed to say “All right!” until you
have fairly gained your seat and arranged your dress.
That there should be some method of communication with the con-
ductor—and a small bell would answer the purpose—instead of having,
as now, to poke his ribs, with your umbrella, or to run the risk of
pulling him off his elevated bracket by tugging furiously at his coat tails,
more general; whereas, at present, no one ever thinks of getting, into
an omnibus unless he is actually compelled. Our omnibuses are little
better than police vans—only not so well regulated—into which no
|man springs of his own accord, but into which he is forced by the cruel
|pressure of circumstances. Really, if it were not for the disgrace o
the thing, we think we would sooner ride in a police van than in an
omnibus—for it contains more room, goes faster, keeps better time, and
the conductor hands you in and out, and looks after you, with the
greatest care and §.
DOMESTIC RETURNS.
MR. FLINT, of Flint Lodge, in Flintshire, has moved for the following
Returns, and the necessary papers have been ordered tº be placed upon
the mahogany table of the dº. as soon as possible:
For a return of the silver forks and spoons, which were had out on
the occasion of the last evening party, and which have never been
returned to the plate-basket yet. . -
For a return of the housekeeping book, which has not been checked
for the last three weeks. - -
For a return of the number of º and puddings which have been
consumed during the last six months, and to ascertain what effect they
bear upon the weekly expenses, with the view of taking into consideration
the policy of discontinuing the same. - -
For a return of all the books, no matter whether amusing, instructive,
scientific, cookery-books, or novels, which have been taken out of the
library, and never been returned to their places. . .
For a return of my slippers, which have been missing from the side
of my bed for the last two days. - - -
For a return of the quantity of table-beer that is drunk in the kitchen,
and to consider whether it would not be advisable, and decidedly
cheaper, to give them money in lieu of same, and, at the same time, to
reflect upon the propriety, and probable cheapness, of engaging for the
future none but temperance servants.
For a return of my silk umbrella which that confounded old fool
SIMPKINs carried away with him on Friday evening last, after having
won my money at cards. -
For a return of all the children's frocks which have only been turned
Once.
For a return of all the children to school as quickly as possible, as
they are unbearable at home, and their appetites are such that it is
impossible to satisfy them. -
or a return of all the Christmas bills, as yet unpaid, distinguishin
those which have been contracted for personal, and those for genera
F. and to see whether the latter cannot be materially reduced
this year.
For a return (only I consider it almost hopeless) of the gratitude that
is shown me by my wife and children for the way in which I am always
slaving to support them; and, also, for a return of the amount of
respect that I am entitled to, as well as the amount I receive from the
servants for the opportunity my means put at their disposal, and for
which the ungrateful creatures have ſhe greatest reason to bless
themselves, of living in such a respectable establishment.
Convent Sells.
IT seems that there are numerous Convents in England containm
from three to seven inmates, but which are puffed by the Popis
press as regular nunneries. Instead of describing such very small
sisterhoods as nunneries it would be more truthful to call them
next-to-none-eries.
A SERVICE OF DANGER.
It is a mercy that the Friends who went as envoys from their Society
to the EMPEROR N1cholas did not burn their fingers, particularly as
That there should be one fixed price for the fare of an omnibus, and
not made variable, as it now is, at the pleasure of the proprietor, being
threepence to-day and sixpence to-morrow; so that a passenger may

THE POPULAR AND AMUSING GAME OF BATTLEDORE AND
SHUTTLECOCK,
As AT PRESENT Played IN THE PRINCIPAL THOROUGHFARES.
“BULLYING AT PUBLIC schools.”
MoRE than one of our public schools have lately furnished eases
which fairly come under the head of “Aggravated Assaults,” and
which ought, therefore, to have figured in the Police reports rather
than in the miscellaneous columns of the newspapers. Brute force,
with its customary attendant cowardice, had, we hoped, fallen down to
the lowest classes of society, but we regret to find that, in the highest
classes of some of our public schools, the bully and the ruffian may still
be met with. Not long ago there were some painful disclosures of
some disgraceful, proceedings at Harrow; and now we hear of an
#. assault at Rugby by two ruffians of 16, or 17 on a little
fellow, apparently between 10 and 11. These two noble youths, while
kicking and beating their diminutive victim were caught in the act
by a farmer's son, a lad of probably about their own age, and to
whom they began to howl for mercy when he, very excusably, com:
menced inflicting upon them a taste of the violence they had exercised
upon the unfortunate child that had fallen into their clutches. We
are sick of the humbug we sometimes hear by way of excuse for the
indolence of masters as to the propriety of not interfering with the
boys at a public school, but leaving the stronger to oppress the weaker
with impunity.
It is true one might hope that, among a large body of the sons of
ſº something like a wholesome public º would prevail;
ut experience unfortunately proves that the public opinion of a public
school cannot be trusted. Lying and deception are º practised
on the masters without exciting disgust among the generality of the
boys, and though perhaps there may be one here and there who feels
shame and contempt for the meanness he sees around, he meets with so
little sympathy in his views that the chances are he will be either
laughed or bullied out of his own sense of propriety by his unscrupulous
schoolfellows.
It is a monstrous hoax to talk of the moral tone of a school in
which eight or nine youths could stand by, without interfering to
prevent an act of i. cruelty rºj º a boy in the higher
form upon a boy beneath him, and indeed the truth is, that the

THE POETICAL HANSARD.
As every one allows that the speeches in Parliament are
dry, and as throwing cold water on the speakers does not
seem to have a very refreshing effect, we propose to give a
little additional zest, if possible, to some of the prosaic
efforts of legislative oratory, by turning them into poetry.
We have selected SIBTHoRPs speech on the Russian War,
not as being the best adapted to the purposes of the poet,
though, perhaps it has peculiar claims on rhyme, -
utter abnegation of all connection with reason.
The speech of which the following is a poetical para-
Eastern question.
Sir, notwithstanding this display
Of blarney, bounce, and botheration;
I still to Ministers must say,
That humbug is not explanation.
Others pºi the cap may fit,
But if that’s all they have to tell us,
The country can't too soon be quit
Of such a set of scurvy fellows.
Trust them indeed—they’ll find in me
One of their heartiest despisers,
And sooner than my Sovereign see
Left in the hands of such admirers,'
I’d have no Cabinet at all.
And as for all this fuss with Russia,
My own Militia out I’ll call,
And at its head proceed to crush her 1

One physical force ruffian in the upper form breaks the spirit of half-a-
dozen in the lower, who when they rise to the position of their tyrants,
exercise in turn the tyranny they i. endured, and thus the bullying
system is perpetuated without any check from the masters, -
It is quite true that there are at the head of some few of our public
schools, men of a very different stamp from those under whom the
bullying system has grown up: and there is every reason to hope that
the new generation d; masters will do their utmost to put down the
evil; but, unfortunately, they trust too much to the “tone of morality.”

have proved has no existence either at Harrow or at Rugby. We fear
these establishments are not much worse than any of the other public
schools in the “tone” that animates the youths that belong to them.
We only wish some parent of some child who may have been brutally
ill-used by a bigger and stronger boy, would try the effect of the act
for the punishment of Aggravated Assaults, for there is at all events
some power in the hands of the law, if there is no redress to be had at
the hands of the masters.

ANIMATED FURNITURE.
AvTNG been called on to give
2 credit to the popular fallacy—
or fact—that furniture can
walk and talk, we must be
prepared to expect from table-
turning a social as well as a
mechanical revolution of the
most extraordinary character.
§ if it is possible to call a spirit
into a chair, there will be no
occasion to invite anybody to
fill it, and a most distinguished
party may be assembled which
—as spirits have not yet begun
to eat and drink—may combine
the very highest order of com-
pany with the very utmost
economy. A host with a taste!
for good . may sit down
to his humble chop, and place a
dozen chairs round hista le, for
the purpose of filling them with the very choicest spirits he may think
proper to summon. If the talking furniture and the spirit rapping
should become an established fact we may expect to see it announce
in the Morning Post that LADY BLANK, or the HoNou BABLE MRs.
DASH, as the case may be, entertained at dinner ALEXANDER THE
GREAT, MR. PEPYs, Appius CLAUDIUs, SIR CLoudesley Shovel,
CARAct Acus, and MR. DUCRow, to meet LoRD PALMERston and the
French Ambassador. A repast for three would thus serve the purpose
of a dinner for eleven, and an evening assembly might be made to
embrace several hundreds of the most illustrious visitors in the form of
tables, chairs, rout seats, and other articles of furniture, while the cost
need not exceed that of sandwiches for two or three, and about a pint
of neutral negus. -
Cards of invitation will of course have to be sent out to the prin-
cipal furniture marts, and the only difficulty will be to select the A.
in which a distinguished guest from the world of spirits will be
expected. Perhaps the better plan will be to fix on certain articles of
furniture as the types of certain classes, and to issue cards to those
articles which are agreed on as the representatives of the sort of
society whose company is requested. If, for instance, the presence of
a literary man is desired, a bookcase should be asked to give the
pleasure of its company; or if a Turk should be selected for invitation
the lady of the house should intimate to some respectable furniture
dealer, that she is “At Home” to some decent Ottoman. A family
consisting of father and mother and six children, might be invited by
requesting “the honour of the company of half a dozen chairs and two
bows to an evening party,” and a married couple might be asked in
the form of a double-action harp, while a young musical prodigy could
be invited as a piccolo, Particular individuals might be asked as par-
ticular articles of furniture; PENN the Quaker might be invited as an
inkstand; SIR THoMAs LAURENCE, WILKIE, and TURNER, as a chest
of drawers; and the late lamented Primate of all England as a Canter-
bury. . Columbus could be asked as an egg-cup, and a deceased Gold
Stick in Waiting could come as an umbrella stand.
THE EXPENSE OF A MEMBER'S POST.
BESIDEs the legitimate but unaccountable expenses, amounting from
two thousand pounds or so to five times that, sum, which a gentleman
usually incurs by becoming a Member of Parliament, he has to be at
the charge of keeping a Secretary. This retainer must not be a mere
writing clerk. It is necessary that he should have some education
—and a proportionate salary. He has to sustain an immensity of corres-
pondence. This might be so abridged by judicious legislation as to
enable many a representative of an unbought constituency to write all
his own letters; and perhaps LoRD John RussBLL will introduce into
his Bribery Bill some provision for exonerating honourable gentlemen
from the den of an accumulation of those free and easy epistles
which they are now continually pestered with, by free and independent
electors. The responsibilities of a British Iegislator ought not to
include the trouble of answering such applications as these:–

THE DON AND THE WINDMILLS.
OUR PATRIOTIC POETS.
OUR pianoforte poets are all suddenly seized with a fit of patriotism
and though continuing comfortably to “sit at home at ease,” they are
calling upon everybody to “Up with the Standard of England,” price
half-a-crown; to give “Three Cheers for the Red, White and Blue”—
price two shillings; to “Unfurl the Flag”—post free for two dozen
postage stamps—and to accomplish other valorous feats which are
more difficult to do than to sing about, or to write about.
We have no wish to swamp all this enthusiasm by unplugging the
waste pipe of the cistern of matter of fact, but we should have more
faith in the sincerity of these pianoforte heroes and valorous vocalists,
if, instead of composing at home, and shouting in concert rooms the
most vehement invitations to every body else to die for their country,
they would occasionally go forth themselves and try the experiment.
Shedding a little ink is much easier than running the risk of shedding
a little blood, and it is a tolerably safe ºf to roar out after
dinner “Let’s rather die than yield” when neither horn of the dilemma
happens to present itself. As a mode of testing the earnestness of the
parties concerned, we have to E. a volunteer corps, to be called
the First Light Pianoforte and Patriotic Professional Fencibles.
THE COURAGE OF THE CZAR.
* Go, for our persecuted brethren fight !”
Weiling the lust of rule with holy zeal,
Snuffles the Czar: he means, “ č. forth and steal | *
... Whom shall we fear?” the Imperial hypocrite,
Exclaims, and of his eyes, upturns the white.
Fear, of a truth, to him should be unknown
Brave man! who dares before the eternal Throne
To lift his hand, and words like these to speak,
And then to thrust his tongue into his cheek;
12ternal Justice whilst the dying groan
And curse of myriads on his head invoke.
Hero! with aspect so composed and meek,
Blaspheming, and in such a pions tone
Uttering defiance to Heaven's thunderstroke.
“ORDERED To LIE UPON THE TABLE.”—A Spirit-Medium.
PARAGRAPH FOR SOME OF THE PAPERS.
PERHAPs, there is no more striking evidence of a benevolent dispo-
sition than kindness and consideration for animals. . This, amiable trait
of character is often yery strongly and peculiarly evinced by the gentler
sex. A remarkable instance of it has been communicated to us; and
every reliance may be placed on the following statement:-A lady
of rank and fashion, but not less distinguished by her beauty than
her position, possessed a favourite spaniel; one of the true KING
CHARLEs’s breed. Having had the dog almost from her childhood,
she was affectionately attached to it, and the little animal had now
become what, in speaking of the canine race, we may term old. Ad-
vanced years had not impaired its outward appearance, or any of its
sensible or other qualitics, but had unfortunately deprived it of all its
teeth; so that poor FIDo had for some time been obliged to put up
with spoon-diet. Distressed at the privation thus endured by her pet,
its fair mistress at last conceived the lºppy idea of º its powers
of mastication, restored by artificial aid. Accordingly, she consulted
MR. MoRRIs SALMoNs, Surgeon-Dentist, by whom Fido was supplied
with a complete set of his newly invented terro-elastic teeth; by means
of which, the faithful creature is now thoroughly enabled to enjoy its
food, and experiences not the slightest difficulty in crunching the
hardest bone of a mutton-chop.
Great Anxiety in the County of Middlesex.
WE understand that the Electors of Middlesex, tired of waiting any
longer, and despairing of receiving any intelligence through the usual
channels of information, have resolved upon fitting out immediately an
expedition to go in search of MR. BERNAL Osborne, who has been
missing for some time past, and of whom no tidings have been heard
since the opening of Parliament.
The Modern Crusader.
Nicholas pretends that he is fighting the battle of the Cross against
the Crescent. This is so far true that, in consequence of the opposition
his ºlitious designs have met with, he is himself as cross as cross
Call be.

THE TAP on THE DANUBE.
S our troops are likel
to have warm work
with the Cossack sa-
vages, they will of
course frequently ex-
perience thirst, for
the relief of which it
is requisite that pro-
visionshould be made.
This has not been for-
gotten, if, as we hope,
there is truth in the
! subjoined newspaper
= paragraph:—
“Good NEws won THE
TRoops. – Arrangements
have been made by the
Government with a first-
E rate London Brewery to
supply the troops while in
Turkey, &c., with the best
export porter at 3d. per
quart. A ship of 350 tons
burden is now preparing
to take in the first consign-
ment for Malta and Con-
stantinople.”
As the Maltese do
not, or cannot, add
hops to their malt in such a manner as to produce beer, the consignment, of a
uantity of that liquor to Malta was a judicious measure; and if the integrity of
the Qttoman Empire is to be preserved by our troops, it is but right that Entire
should also have been sent for their use to Constantinople. May the heavy give
weight to their charge, and enable them to offer a stout resistance to any number
of the enemy. Without becoming pot-valiant, the British soldier will fight the
better for his pot of beer. Those who draw the sword for their country deserve
at least a draught of porter; and doubtless they will draw the former vigor-
ously, although they may draw the latter mild.
EXAMINATIONS FOR BARRISTERS.
IT has long been thought expedient that law students should be subject to
some examination_previous to being called to the Bar. Under the present
system, an Utter Barrister may be called an utter ignoramus, and the only cram:
ming that is requisite to fit him for his profession is to cram a certain number of
dinners down his throat. He need know nothing more of law or . than
the fact that the “remainderman” is the man who gets the remainder of the
i. tart, which has already been attacked by the three who have gone
efore him in the same mess. A “joint interest” is, to him, nothing more than
the interest he feels in the joint that is brought to table, and of a “demurrer”
he understands nothing but the fact that it is idle to demur to the wretched
stuff that is passed off as port wine at the students’ table.
There seems, at length, some hope that the system of eating one's way to the
Bar will give place to a more sensible system, and a ''. cation will hence-
forth be ãº. by what the candidate is able to send forth from his mouth,
instead of by what he has stuffed into it. If we are to believe the Honourable
Member who has brought the subject forward, the only book strongly recom-
mended for perusal to a forensic aspirant, is “Joe Miller;” and, indeed, we
cannot help seeing that, whenever a joke is hazarded at the Bar, the source of it is
the very i.i. authority alluded to. The “legal mind” has such a love of
precedent that a joke, no less than a case, must be found “in the books” before
it is ripe for Westminster. Hall, where a new idea and a new enthusiasm would
stand an equal chance of rejection. It is but the other day that the majority of the
Judges were lost in bewilderment as to whether a man who had been convicted
of stealing some eggs, had stolen, the eggs, because there was a doubt whether
the eggs, were properly laid in the indictment, when, to the great relief of the
; bench, it was discovered that “SHEARs's case” had settled the point,
or rather that the judge who tried “SHEARs's case” many years ago, had said
º: which d the judges of the present day were quite content to say
alter Illin.
We sometimes wonder what is the use of an Act of Parliament when we find the
yariety of interpretations which can be put upon it in a Court of Law, where, ve
frequently, instead of an inquiry what the Act means, there is a musty research
into what HULLOCK ruled half a century ago, or the whole Court gets suddenly
confounded by an obiter dictum of the garrulous GARRow, which is, in turn,
smashed by a sentence from the lips of Buller, J., ferreted out of some ancient
jº by the research of some aged junior, with one leg in the grave, and the
other in FITzHERBERT's “Natura Brevium.” We feel satisfied there is little use
in reforming the law unless we reform the lawyers, and we hail the attempt that
has been made to get rid of the gross absurdity, and gross feeding which, at
present, form the introduction to the profession of a barrister.
REASONS AGAINST REFORM.
LoRD John RussBLL (rising).
I own, MR. SPEAKER, it was not my wish
To cook, in this fashion, our kettle of fish,
But my family motto impels me to state
That a wise man will j to the dictates of fate,
And since the Reform Bill meets slight acceptation
From those I see here, or, indeed, from the nation,
Which can’t take its eyes from the war in the East,
Why, we’ll put off Reform “for the present at least.”,
And here I might stop, for I really have stated
Why the “cause” should (in equity phrase) be “abated,”
But statesmen conceive that for all that they do
A great heap of reasons is better than few.
§: one rifle-ball’s fatal—that is, if it hits,
ut a blunderbuss must blow an object to bits),
So of reasons—not reason—here follows a feast,
For postponing Reform “for the present at least.”
Because the Directors, as PAxton has bidden 'em,
Demand extra funds for the Palace at Sydenham;
Because, when the Guardsmen embarked, the sad news :
Produced a most awful effect on the Jews;
Because a new Ant-Eater's come to the Park,
And the Peers have a notion their House is too dark,
And because MR. KINGSLEY is author of “Yeast,”
We will put off our Bill “for the present at least.”
Because old LABLACHE, with a very fat sigh,
Goes over, this year, to the army of Gye,
Because the habitué expects to be bored
By snobs, with “Well, what is this Etoile du Nord.”
Because we’re to have a new o by WERDI
I greatly prefer a well ãº.
nd because the old orc won't be increased,
We must put off Reform “for the present at least.”
Because the poor cits, in their blundering zeal,
Cannot hit on a place for the statue to PEEL,
Because MAROCHETTI's, so grand and so tall,
Is lost in the cabstand at Westminster Hall;
Because the old bridge here, is sinking, they say,+
Perceptibly losing its half-inch a day,
Notwithstanding it’s buttressed, supported, and pieced–
We’ll put off Reform “for the present at least.”,
Because my friend PAM, with no small approbation,
Has §, not the Sewers, but their Administration.
Because my friend GLADSTONE, for war-money troubled,

BARON ALDERSON'S WIG.
THE following startling advertisement appeared on the 3rd of
March in the Times:—
TEN POUNDS REWARD.—LOST or STOLEN, from Westminster, on or
about the night of the 21st of February, a FULL-BOTTOMED WIG, the property
of MR. BARox AldeRson. Whoever will give such information to MR. METHERELL,
wig-maker, 47, Carey Street, Lincoln's Inn, as will lead to the recovery of the above,
shall receive FIVE POUNDS REWARD; or, if stolen, shall receive the sum of £10
on conviction of the offender or offenders.
Considering the popular superstition as to wisdom, which is said to
reside in the wig, there is something rather alarming in the announce-
ment that one of our ablest judges is at present in a state of wiglessness.
We can only compare a . without his wig to ALADDIN without his
lamp, and we must therefore hope that the genius of the wig will
speedily restore to the judicial head that mountainous pile of horsehair
. constitutes the summit of judicial wisdom—the crowning point
Of Justice.
We must, however, protest against the paltry estimate that has been
put upon the value of this highest attribute of the judge's office, and
we indignantly repudiate the wretched under-valuation of the wisdom
of BARON ALDERSON; for, if one of our best judges is to be rated at
only £10, what price can we be allowed to put upon some of the less
sagacious occupants of the Bench—and cushions—of Justice? We
have puzzled ourselves not a little in thinking how the learned judge
could have lost his wig, for if it was taken from his head, it must have
been done—if not immediately under his nose—almost immediately
over his nose, which would seem to us a very adroit process to have
been performed by a thief without detection. Possibly the learned
judge may have been so lost in the contemplation of some abstract
point that his .# was abstracted before he was aware of what was
going on, or rather going off, over head; or, it may have happened,
that in the midst of some excessively dull speech of counsel, his
lº may have dropped off, when his wig might have dropped off
by the force of j.
We sincerely hope the missing wig may be restored to its high
}. on the brows of MR. BARON ALDERson, whose fine judicial
orehead may be regarded as the Temple of Justice. We cannot bear
to think that the honoured horsehair which so recently reposed on the
head of an ALDERSON should form the stuffing of some ignoble couch,
or descend to the degraded seat of some wretched cab, whose driver
may be an habitual violator of that law of which the late possessor of
the desecrated wig is one of the brightest ornaments.
A Mistake about the Rite.
AN advertisement in the Times, addressed to Parish Clerks, offers a
guinea for the “BAPTISMAL REGISTER” of ANGELo Louis Levy. It
is to be feared that the certificate of MR. LEvy's baptism is not to be
for any money.
IMPERIAL DEVOTION.
CZAR. Nicholas is so devout, they say,
His Majesty does nothing else than prey."
A Berlin Muff.
THE pusillanimous conduct of the KING of PRussia at the present
crisis, appears to indicate an apprehension that the Czar will eat him
| as a sausage, to Turkey. But this fear exhibits his Prussian
Majesty in the fight of a very Small German.
ART-FINERY.
A, Book, has been published with the title of “Dress as a Fine Art.”
We hope this work does not recommend ladies to embellish themselves
by painting.
AMERICAN PARTNERSHIP.
URELY it is a great comfort
and encouragement to us to
have the sympathy of our
American kinsmen in the
struggle whereon ...we are
entering with the Power of
Tyranny and Barbarism, and
ing in the sentiments thus
expressed by GENERAL J.
ATson WEBR, .."; Ill
the Times ...?. ears
for the invasion of our com-
merce by privateering enter-
prise on the part of his fellow
citizens:—
“The contingency to which I al-
lude, as being the only one which
could prompt an interference in
European affairs, is, I sincerely
hope, very far distant, but which
should never be lost sight of in
England, and which may ultimately
be averted altogether by its being
constantly kept before the world—I mean a combination of the Continent at some
future day against England as the great embodiment of constitutional, liberty in
Europe. That day may come. How soon, if ever, He alone knows in whose hands
are the destinies of nations. But come when it may, our interests and our, feelings
will alike combine to make us come to the rescue. We shall come, it may be, from
a conviction that in fighting your battles we are contending for the cause of constitu-
tional liberty. Our plea or our excuse for coming may be self-preservation; but in
such a contingency come we will; and be assured that the youthful giant-for we
shall be a giant before that day arrives—will not come, the less willingly, or strike
less effectively, because his strength will be put forth in behalf of a parent, wh9. if
she was not always a kind mother, gave to us our Anglo-Saxon blood, and sent us fºrth
deeply imbued with her laws, her literature, and her love of constitutional liberty.
The Americans will help us fight the Battle of Freedom if needbe-
in the meanwhile, we have their best wishes. So far from, bein
inclined to molest us with privateers, their hearts are so, much wit
our cause that we may venture to propose to them an undertaking in
the nature of a private speculation, to be directed against the .
in which they might join us. ere is one of the most remark-
able men in the States, to whom, we trust, our, proposal will be
seen by no manner of means a bad notion. The suggestion we
would offer, more particularly for the consideration of that, distin-
ished individual, is that .# raising a sum of money sufficiently
rge to purchase the EMPEROR Nicholas of the Russian natiºn,
which will, no doubt, in a short time be glad to sell him.
We
calculate that the amount required will not be exorbitant. Indeed
we expect that his subjects will be too happy to take bid for
their #je. when they find that it is necessary, at events,
to get rid of him. They will naturally prefer disposing ºf him, at
some little profit to clearing him off like mere ballast. Perhaps they
will accept a figure for their Czar not much above the quotation of a
pretty valuable nigger. -
Having bought Nicholas at a vile price, boots and all, the enter;
prising speculator might take him about the country in a carayan, and
show him, as an extraordinary monster, in the principal towns in Great
Britain and the Union, after which he might be shipped over, and ex-
hibited at Constantinople, whereby there is every just reason to believe
that in a comparatively short time a considerable fortune would be
realised. Everybody would go to see the greatest, monster, in the
world—a monster greater than the Missouri Leviathan or the Sea-
Serpent. We do hope that the eminent man in our eye with regard tº
this project will think well of it. He has raised himself, to a .#
degree of opulence and social position by showing Lions; but he would
elevate himself several notches higher, if he could manage to, exhibit
the Russian Bear. Having now indicated this promising scheme of
business, we commend it to the serious attention of BARNUM.
Origin of the Quarterlies.
We think it is clear that the plan of the Edinburgh and Quarterly
Reviews must have been borrowed from the curious habit they have of
reading things in Parliament, for we notice that whenever the Members
have something very heavy in hand which it is impossible for them to
get through, it is generally ordered “to be read this day three months,”
which, in plain English, means that they never intend to read it at all.
LOVE LOST BETWEEN LOCKSMITHS.
MR. CHUBB has made it pretty clear by his recent, correspondence,
that whether he can pick a'. or not, he is very skilful at picking
a quarrel.

THE SAUSAGE MAKING MANIA.
THE British sausage has always been a mystery to us, and a mystery
we have felt no inclination to go into. The British sausage has, in our
eyes—for we have usually kept it out of our mouth—been a compound,
in which our imagination has pictured the º of those who have
led literally a “cat and dog life,” being blended together at last in
silent union. A new light has recently been thrown upon the sausage
by an advertisement, which would seem to show that there is some
rather close connection between the British sausage and the British
Lion. We have often heard from the Protectionists of the decease of
that highly popular beast, though we suspect that the creature they
...?under that name was an inferior brute in the skin of the
nobler animal. This must be the supposed lion alluded to in the an
nexed advertisement as having “gone off” into sausage-meat.
HOME-MAIDE SAUSAGES.
HE NOISELESS LION SAUSAGE-MAKING MACHINE, MINCE-
Dublin, and shown in several public institutions. It was inspected and patronised
by the Lord-Lieuten ANT, the Countrss of St. GERMAINs, and several other ladies
of distinction, on account of the simple and effective working. It makes no noise,
is not dangerous (the cutters being alienclosed) the meat (put in in pieces of two inches)
machine. It will also cut vegetables for soup into the size of peas; and cut bread for
force-meat, &c. as fine as grating. It can be worked on counter, dresser, or table, and
in appearance is ornamental, &c. N
Now, we presume, it is not imperative on any one who uses this
machine, to use it exclusively for Lion Sausages, inasmuch as the old
§ direction, “first catch your hare,” would º suggest
the difficulty of complying with the hint “first catch your lion.” If
the machine can be made available in producing a home made sausage
of some wholesome substance, it will indeed be a boon, and we can’t
be surprised that even the Countess of St. GERMAINs and other
ladies of distinction have taken an interest in its working. As the
machine is “ornamental,” it is probably intended to become an article
of furniture; and if the “ladies of distinction” begin to take it up as
a "hobby,” we shall perhaps find “sausage making’ taking its turn
with crochet work as an object of fashionable female industry. For
our own parts, if a lady friend were to offer her services to make us
either a sausage or an anti-macassar, we should say at once “Give us
a sausage.”

RAW MATERIAL OF BARRISTERS.
As all the good things which can be created by Act of Parliament
(and a good many acts look as if such creation had been their chief
object) are given to Barristers, the least these gentleman can do, in
return for so much kindness, is to keep themselves decent and
respectable. But they do not think so, apparently. Hear one of their
own number, who is just now eloquent on the subject.
“A little time since it came out that a barrister was keeping a confectioner's shop,
under a false name, in the Strand. Not the smallest notice is taken of him by the
Benchers. Not long ago it came out at a trial at Nisi Prius in London, that a hosier
was a member of one of the Inns of Court. I believe there are a good many persons
of our profession keeping shops in London. A few years since an inspector of police
was called to the bar."
And the writer adds, that more than one person, whose name is in
the Law List, follows an occupation too viſe to be even hinted at by
Mr. Punch. -
Of course there are excuses for everything in this world. The
barrister-confectioner might say, that like many of his brethren, he
is eye upon Parliament; that a restaurant was only the French
for a refresher, and that his selling the eye of the bull did not prevent
his having the ear of the Court. The barrister-hosier, if vulgarly
flippant, would probably urge, that though bas was a foreign word for
stockings, selling stockings could not be foreign to the bar (a joke
which ought to raise Hosier's Ghost), and then, with a smirk, he
would very likely ask, “what was the next article” of indictment
against him. And as for the barrister-policeman, he would, in his own
opinion, be just the man, not only to move the Court, but to make it
keep moving. But these reasons would fail to satisfy Mr. Punch that
confectioners, hosiers, and policemen are proper persons to become
barristers and receive Government appointments, and as MR. NAPiek
has taken up the matter he hopes that gentleman will make no bones,
not even “NAPIER's bones,” of dealing with it vigorously.
The Money Market.
MR. BRIEFLEss is delighted at the talk of there being a “Law for
the Abolition of Settlement” as it will enable him, he says, to meet
with a much better face his creditors when they call upon him, as they
will keep doing, for the payment of their “little bills.” MR. DUNUP
we are told, is equally delighted.

“AFTER DINNER " DEBATES.
E are sorry to see
that some Mem-
bers of the House
just discovered a
new method of
wasting the time
of the country (as
if the multiplicity
of modes already
in existence were
not enough for
the purpose), and
the precedent has
been set of asking
an explanation of
what Ministers
may have said at
their meals.
Though a pri-
vate individual
may take “his
ease at his inn,”
a member of the
Government will
not be permitted
to take it easy at
his club. Our
lively friend PAL-
MERston—who, like Punch, LoRD BROUGHAM, and nearly all other
great charaeters, combines an abundance of wit with an ample share of
wisdom—has given offence to MR. BRIGHT, whose name seems at
variance with his character, for having made a few jokes at a dinner
where he, the Home Secretary, presided as chairman. The Noble
Lord was not sufficiently lugubrious on the festive occasion to suit the
melancholy humour—or want of humour—which distinguishes, the
Member for Manchester. According to MR. BRight’s notion, nothin
ought to have *. but the decanters, and the Chairman shoul
have assumed all the solemnity of an undertaker, on the dismal occa-
sion that had brought the company !". If Mr. BRIGHT is
correct in his idea of how the recent dinner at the Reform Club
should have been conducted, there ought to have been a CHADBAND
for a Chairman and a PEcksNiff for a Vice.
If the sort of questions that the Puritans of Parliament have set an
example of are to be persevered in, we may expect something like
. following notices in the paper of the Legislative business of the
ay.
MR. FRENch to ask LoRD JoãN RUssell, whether it is true that he,
LoRD John Russelſ, just before going to bed, on Wednesday last,
with a cold, did, or did not, call out to some one who was present,
“Just give us our gruel;” and whether he spoke those words with
reference to our present position with regard to Russia, and whether
the words may be considered as an admission of weakness, intending
to imply that any foreign power is likely to subdue us, or “to give usi
our gruel,” in a certain slang sense, in which the words are generally
received. - - -
MR. MooRE to ask whether it is true that, at a dinner lately given
in the neighbourhood of Lincoln's Inn, a report was mentioned to be
in circulation that a certain Judge of the Court of Queen's Bench has
his feet frequently in hot water, and whether any judge who is
continually in hot water ought not to be removed.
The EARL or DERBy to ask, the EARL of CLARENDoN whether he
had communicated to the publisher of “What shall we have for
Dinner P’’ or any other cookery-book at any time a peculiar method of
making a Cabinet Pudding, and whether it is with º sanction of his
colleagues that the secrets of the Cabinet are disclosed.
The EARL of CLANRICARDE to ask the EARL of ABERDEEN whether
it is true that an orange in quarters was handed by the Premier to the
French Ambassador at a dinner at the former's table, and whether the
incident was significative of any understanding between the French
and English Governments as to giving or taking quarter in the im-
pending war.
LoRD Fitzwilliam to ask any Member of the Government whether
at any dinner at which any one of them has recently been present, any
observation has been made on any NESSELRoDE Pudding which might
be taken in an offensive sense by the Minister of a Great Power with
which we are not yet openly at war.

Lord Brougham. I want to get at your ideas of the way the press obtains its materials.
To-night you have told the Peers, that the first journal (except Punch) in the world can only
have obtained the information on which certain #. articles were based, by the fraud of
some inferior official. Well, let us accept your thesis. Fancy yourself the Editor of a

| Lord Derby. Well, I suppose they get that sort
of thing as they get the foreign politics; Clerks
and shopmen are as easily bribed as valets and
footmen. Then, Itake it, the writers must guess
at what they don’t know, and if they are contra-
dicted, burn the letters that do it, and so make
all safe. Artful dodgers, depend upon it. ..
Lord Campbell. The course a Ministry is likely

indicated with a good deal of precision. Come,

ERE the war-clouds, darkly closing,
Shudder to the rending flash,
Ere a world holds breath to listen
To the opening thunder-crash:
Hear, fromyonder seat of judgment,
Words of peace—the true—the best–
Ah!—the noble words are stifled,
And a noble heart hath rest!
Dead He should have died hereafter,
Time had come for such a word,
When the day of fight was over,
And the triumph-bells were heard.
Statesman—Minister of Justice—
Friend of all who needed friend,
Poet—might he not have tarried,
Seen our conflict to an end ?
Had the Statesman marked his nation
Check and crush invading might;
Had the upright Judge, rejoicing,
Watched the victory of the Right;
Had the oppress'd one's Friend beheld us
Raise the weak—dash down the strong,
Then, perchance, the Poet's utterance
Had awaked in glowing song.

Life and Death obey their LORD,
And the golden bowl is broken,

That we loved him long and well.
Let it speak of kindliest nature,
Of the hiº yet subtle mind,
Of a heart a ºf
With affection for his kind.
Speak of honour—trust—and frankness,
Of a hand preventing need,

Making bounty rich indeed.
Then record how he, undaunted
Fought through faction's wild turmoil,
To uphold the Thinker's title
To the earnings of his toil.
How low cant and selfish cunning

Touched with Art’s all-kindling ray.

PARLIAMENT AND THE PRESS.
PARLIAMENT has lately been in a state of much fermentation on the
subject of the Press—not because the Press fails in its duty, but because
it does its duty too well. The Press undertakes to obain information
for the public, and Parliament is angry at the information being
obtained by the Press before it has reached the ears of statesmen, who
are beaten occasionally in the race of Intelligence by the public jour-
malists. Legislators grow indignant over the matter and begin to ask
who can have been betraying “state secrets,” as though all information
must come from official quarters, and can only be obtained by official
corruption. The Press, lºſſ an honourable reliance on its
own ability and energy to a degrading dabble ºn the slough of official
venality which the Legislature º to exist. -
It turns out, however, that if placemen really, wished to sell the
information derived through their official opportunities, they have not
the article to dispose of, inasmuch as Downing Street is not always so
well informed as Printing House Square. The journalist often knows
what is going on, though the statesmen will only know, it when the
event itself and its novelty may be going off. It is quite legitimate for
legislators to wonder at their own ignorance as much as, they please,
but it is not fair to presume that there is no wisdom but the wisdom
of Parliament, and that if Parliament is unenlightened, the Press
cannot be honestly informed.

force. Not content with his own violence, he had endeavoured to
persuade two other rather doubtful characters to join him in his
outrage on Civilisation, but they feared to become his accomplices,
[And, of course, MASTER ToM relapses into his previous very obstinate state.
| A LANDLORD'S BOROUGH.
THE printed report of the Tynemouth Com-
mission reveals some extraordinary particulars
respecting the constituency of that borough, of
whose whole population one-seventh consists of
publicans; and as each of these is a host in him-
self, the whole body must exert a great influence
in elections. To this particular class of electors
it *. that the practice of corruption is
limited, being, however, carried amongst them,
to a quite unlimited extent; so that the only
public spirit to which these publicans can make
any pretence, may be said to be gin; to which
disfranchisement might be added, by way of
bitters. The two candidates are found to have
paid £900 between them for colours and rosettes,
which, however brilliant, resolve themselves,
evidently, into bribery of the blackest dye. The
election expenses of each are stated to have
amounted altogether to £2,500. Pocket Boroughs
were nearly done away with by the first Reform
Bill, which, however, has left untouched many
such places as Tynemouth, which may be calle
Out-of-Pocket Boroughs. CALIGULA made his
horse a consul: if anybody has a jackass that he
would wish to send to Parliament, let him get
the donkey to stand for Tynemouth at a cost of
between two and three thousand pounds.
Admiralty Experience.
IT has often been complained that the Lords of
the Admiralty have no practical acquaintance
with nautical affairs. º, however, can
deny that the present First, Lord is so far a
good sailor, that he has, as his late speech at
the Reform Club testifies, been half seas over.

rumour of an outbreak, it is invariably the first

though he so intimidated them that they wavered a good deal, and at
last promised to stand by and say nothing.
In reply to some questions that were put to her, poor Civilisation
said that she had done nothing she was aware of to offend Nicholas,
unless it was by showing some sympathy for a poor old Turk, whom he
was bullying and ill-treating, besides trying to break up an Ottoman,
which the Complainant wished to preserve.
It further appeared that the Defendant had made use of the most
rofane and blasphemous language, and indeed his conduct altogether
ad been so unreasonable and violent, that there was some ground for
believing he could not be in his right mind. - -
After some further testimony to the same effect, it was adjudged
that Nicholas should be jº up for judgment on a future occa-
sion, and that in the mean time he should be bound over in very
heavy sureties to keep the peace. -
As he refused to find the sureties required, he was ordered to be
locked up, and was left in the custody of that able officer, “Old
CIIARLEY,” who confidently undertook to lock him up forthwith.
MONEY ORDERS MADE EASY.
Much excitement has been caused by the appearance of the subjoined
newspaper paragraph:
“Mowry ORDERs.-On the 1st of April and thenceforward, increased facilities will
be afforded in procuring Money Orders, and obtaining payment of them when such
payment is made through a bank. The Postmaster-General has directed that some of
the precautions required for the security of ordinary Money Orders shall, in these
cases, be dispensed with.”
Bankers, we understand, will be enabled to procure Money Orders
for their customers for the mere ºf The Postmaster-General has
even authorised the dispensation with the *#. of requiring a
deposit of the amount payable by the order. These arrangements,
however, will not extend beyond the day above named. It is not
true that the Post Office will grant Money Orders gratis after the
lst of April.

THE BEAR IN MR. PUNCH's MENAGERIE.
BY THE KEEPER.
HERE he is, ladies and gen-
tlemen! Let me direct
your attention to that
gigantic, and bulky_ke-
vodruped, the Rooshan
Bear. This hinterestin
but ill lookin' speciment
9f Natural Istory is, as
his name Fº an in-
abitant of the North of
Europe: in which, do-
minions the Lion bein
unknown, he is looked
upon by the unappy and
ignorant natives as the
ing of Beasts. In dis-
º howsomdever,
e by no means re-
sembles the generosity
and m mity of
that noble hanimal; his
natur' partakin' of the
craft and cunnin' of the
fox, the malice of the
hº or baboon, and the fierceness and woracity of the larfin'iena.
he hanimal now before you, ladies and gentlemen, is well known.
He is better known than trusted, Bears in general is treacherous
hanimals; but more particularly that there individjle of the genius.
He keeps his eye upon his prey for years together, awaitin' his oppor-
tunity an underd timespatienter and slier than a cat watchin'amouse.
In the meanwhile he conceals his carnivorious propensities with so
much art as to impose upon and deceive the closesthobserver; whereby
†: judges have been led into the mistake of supposin' of him
to be a wegetable feeder. In conseqvence of the hinsidjus character of
the Rooshan Bear I ope ladies and gentlemen will excuse me from
wenturin on the dangerous attempt of henterin his den. This azardous
and foolardy experiment has been tried by three Quakers, who is said
to have went in and shook im by the por; but I ave not yet eerd
whether they’ve come out again.
The fº Bear is notorious for his cruelty and windictiveness to
the human specie; and 'specially to the female sect, in which barbarity
he exceeds the Howrang Howtang. The story of the unfortnit Nuns
of Minsk, whose backs was cruelly lacerated by this onmerciful brute
is too familiar to inspire comment.
Though the inabitant of Russia, the Bear of that country extends
his ravidges and depredations into the adjinin’ territories in all direc-
tions, as far as he possible can. Being sometimes resisted by the
courage of the poppilation, he is forced to beat a retreat, and take to
his eels with a flea in his ear, and a sore ed, wich as been more than
wunce inflicted by the renowned SchAMYL, the Lion WALLIs of
Circassia.
The diet of the Rooshan Bear consists mostly of the witals of the
nation, or innards, which he is purwided with under the influence of
fear by the Rooshian serfs, to satisfy his mawr. Peraps you’ll be of
opinion that them as demeans themselves to carry 'im is "wissera is a
sort of creechurs that ain’t fit for no better employment. For want
of proper offal this here hanimal have been pitchin' into Turkey, which
bein’ footough for him, he is now sufferin' from indigestion.
The temper of the Rooshian Bear is usially morose and sullen, inter-
rupted with fits of rage and º; when he goes down on his marrow-
bones and turns his eyes up into his edgrowlin' meanwhile and showin'
his teeth, in a manner orrible to witness and painful to relate. Of
late this hammai has grown so furious that we have resolved to chain
and muzzle him, which, though a service of danger and difficulty, we
shall endeavour to accomplish hundeterred by peril and regardless of
expense.
shall now, ladies and gentlemen, proceed to exibit some highdear
of this hanimal's ferocity, by means of stirrin him up with a long Pole;
a Pole in his flank bein’, as you will observe, a sort of thing as renders
him, particklarly cantankerus.
A ConversationAL TRUTH.—Women never tire of talking about
babies, and men about horses.

BRITANNLA rules the Waves.

THE FARMER AND HIS FRIEND.
*TIs an ill wind, they says, as blows nobody º
What’s one feller's famine’s another chap's food:
Of which observation the vorce ye may zee
In this here disturbance’tween Roosher and we.
No grain from Odesser be now to come in,
Which zofur is having Purtection agin, .
And happy's the warmer that's held on his carn,
And has a good store in his rick and his barn.
The rest of the people will think it severe
That bread and purvisions in general is dear;
But what other business zoever may droop,
At laste Agricultur’ is now cock-a-whoop!
Not only is grain a high price, but bezides
The demand is increasin’ for taller and hides:
You wun't zay that breedin' prize cattle's a sin,
Now there’s sich a call for the fat and the skin.
The EMPRoRo Roosh ER there’s zum as do cuss;
There’s many as wishes death to 'un, and wus,
But I, for my part, no sich malice wun't bear,
And don’t hate my enemy quite like that 'ere.
Zo soon to his 'count Idoan’t want the chap sent;
Naw, gie un due laishur and time to repent:
Repent, in the end, I do trust he’ll be made:
The later the better for our line o' trade.
Meanwhile here’s his health—as the Parson was as 't
To drink much the zame when the bottle was pass'd—
We lives by the feller: then why should we stick
At drinkin' long life—not success—to OLD Nick?
RUGBY WINDICATED.
RUGBY has for some time stood high among public Schools, and we
are delighted to find that nothing has occurred to throw any stain on
its character. A report, which turns out to be in many respects erro-
neous, led us to fear that the moral tone of Rugby had been lately
lowered: but we have received some letters from the School that are
highly honourable to the writers, and convince us that the public opinion
of Rugby is in a wholesome condition. The letters are no anonymous
and abusive diatribes but sensible communications from young gentle-
men who, writing in their own real names, express in manly and mode-
rate terms a natural regret at the injustice that has been done to Rugby
by the circulation of a report which it seems, though allowed to pass
uncontradicted, contained many falsehoods. ... - -
We hastento make to Rugby all the reparation we can for the injustice
we may have done by giving undue credence to an unanswered reportina
newspaper. The assailants of the little boy were, it seems, not much
bigger than himself, and our Rugby correspondents, while ..";
generous contempt for the cowardice of the two boys who set upon the
one, contend that the facts do not warrant the version that has been
given. This version—or perversion-has, it seems, been traced to some
one who has some spite against the School, for having been once turned
out of its playgrounds. . -
The letters we have received are manfully written, and we cheerfully
accept the assurance of the writers, that “bullying, if any does *.
is unknown to, and utterly abhorrent to the feelings of the bigger an
older boys,” whose ideas were “never more sound and healthy than
they now are” on the subject of school tyranny. -
º are glad to beinformed that though the act which called forth
our remarks was grossly exaggerated in the report, nevertheless “the
indigmation of the school was decidedly against the perpetrators of the
deed,” who, we are told, “were most ſº flogged by the Head
Master, when the offence was discovered.”. We are glad to be able to
exonerate all parties but the two original delinquents, and we regret
that, misled by a newspaper report, we should have expressed a doubt
of the morality of the tone of Rugby. There is not a better security
for the youth of a public school than the sort of feeling which seems to
exist at Rugby-a-feeling creditable alike to the Boys and the Masters.
We hope that Rugby is by no means a solitary instance of its kind, and,
indeed, we have reason to know that, in many of our public schools,
the nobler are beginning to prevail over the baser elements.
A Cup of Kindness.
To cement the alliance with France, may we suggest a glass of wine?
And, by way of a graceful compliment, as well as for the good of trad
for the good of the
ublic, for every good reason—for the good even
the revenue-let it º

SENTIMENT IN COOKERY.
of the reason assigned at the end
of this article, our dining-out Con-
tributor has sent in his resignation.
We dispatched him as our repre-
sentative to the recent Reform
Club Banquet, and the exciting
dishes served up by the successor
of the illustrious SoYER, so wrought
upon his feelings, that—But he shall
tell the tale in his own words:
“The turtle and spring soup were
delicious, and we threw ourselves
back in an attitude of calm enjoy-
ment, en attendant the fish. (The
Hock very good). Asked for salmon,
and waiter inquired whether
would have tranches de saumon en
matelote marinière? This dish, as
we afterwards found, was the intro-
duction of the theme—an allusion
to the maritime character of the
entertainment, the profession of the
chief guest, and the nature of the
service on which he was to proceed. Not bad. (Sparkling Moselle
not bad, either.) Mournful reflections caused by appearance on table
of dir poulardes à la NElson. Company evidently much affected, and
tears in several eyes at the painful reminder of the death of our
greatest naval hero, and the possible fate of him whom we were enter:
taining. ... (The poulardes very, delicate eating, but provocative of
thirst-Champagne). Gloom dispersed. Soirante entrées disclose a
bold attempt to hit off the principal features of the Eastern quarrel.
Dir epigrammes d'agneau aur pointes ºf. refer without doubt
to the Wolf and the Lamb fable as played over again, by Russia and
Turkey; and it requires no very keen perception to discern that dir
salmi da bécasse à la Richelieu with an equal number of boudins de
lapereau & la financière indicate the straits to which Russia will soon
be reduced for want of the sinews of war, and that the ministerial
financier of that country will require the genius of a RichELIETI, to
#. himself of his functions creditably. º: soon palls;
fall back to Hock, which is certainly fine.) Then follow the wingi rāts,
and dishes of canards sawvages convey no far-fetched allusion to the
wild hordes whom the Czar is now gathering together to oppose to the
armies of the West. -
“We come next to Soirante entremèts. At the sight of cinq poudings
à la diplomate, cannot but indulge in inextinguishable laughter at this
too evident indication of the failure of the MENschikoff mission (I
drink to STRATFoRD DE REDCLIFFE); and cinq Charlotte Prussiennes
aw Marasquin, followed immediately by cinq Turbands de Meringues aur
pistaches, convey—even to those unacquainted with kitchen French–
profound and unmistakable reference to Prussian vacillation and the
warlike ardour of the turbaned Turks. (QMER PAshA, I pledge thee
twice in the king of all wines.) But it is for the last, course that the
artiste of the Reform Club reserves his highest flight of sentiment.
Cinq gateaua Britanniques à l’Amiral excite in my too susceptible bosom
an enthusiasm which cannot wait for mere formal appeals from the
chair. Quaffing off a special bumper of Burgundy, I raise a murmur
of ‘Bravo, CHARLEY l’ which is hushed down by cold-blooded men on
either side. . But here a mild, benevolent-looking waiter deposits before
me a dish of unwonted proportions. . In a voice rendered thick by the
emotions just called up, I inquire what are its contents, when, reading
from the carte, coldly and unimpassionedly, the waiter replies, ‘Cinq
bombes glacés à la St.-Jean-d'Acre.” I have just time to drink off a
glass of the nearest wine (which happens to be some iced and very
pleasant Chablis); and then, sinking back from before the awful bombes
glacés, and having vividly before my eyes the fate of the powder maga-
zine of St. Jean d'Acre, I lose all consciousness. Not to presume too
long, Sir, upon your attention—I was conveyed to a cab by a posse of
unsympathising waiters, and a racking head-ache all next day attested
the powerful effect which this sudden shock had upon my frame. . It is
to avoid the possibility of any future painful effects of this kind in the
exercise of my vocation that I am compelled, unwillingly, to ask of you
to accept my resignation.”

Improvement at the Admiralty.
OUR remonstrances against the appointment of supperannuated officers
to important posts in the Navy, have not, we are º to find, been ||
without effect. The newspapers have gratified us with the announce-
ment that the mastership of the Baltic fleet has been given to MASTER
GeoRGE BIDDLEcoMBE. We trust that MASTER BIDDLEcoMBE will
justify the confidence which has been reposed in him, and will approve
imself a brave and a steady boy.

Their two flags never thus have flown since famous days of yore,
When ours was not the Union Jack, nor theirs the Tricolor.
To win the holy Sepulchre, beneath the Eastern sky,
I\id then the golden lilies with our English lions fly,
True Christian from false Paynim to defend was then our work,
'Tis now against false Christian to protect the faithful Turk.
But larger is the cause wherein our banners are unfurled,
Free thought, free speech, just government; the freedom of the world,
Not priests', but man's crusade to fight, our ensigns now advance,
The Union Jack of England and the Tricolor of France.
Well met, ye noble standards! and never may ye part;
May you be always emblems of the French and English heart.
To those united colours true, we trustſully may fight;
Thus let the Right assert itsclf, and Heaven will fielp the Right.
LITERAL TRANSLATION OF AN I.O.U.
(By one who holds some hundreds of them.)
I Is the person who gives the I.O.U. for a certain debt.
O stands, in the language of figures, as well as figurative language,
for Naught.
U is the person who, in his simplicity, receives the I.O.U.
The plain meaning, therefore, of the transaction, is, that directly an
I.O.U. passes hands, there is literally nothing—that is, O—standing
between I and U.
And we doubt not that if the histcry of a thousand I.O.U’s. could be
ascertained, the above would be found to be the literal translation of
at least nine hundred and ninety-nine out of them.

The reason why the Clergy advocate Homoeopathy, we should think,
is, because the Clergy do not understand Medicine. They think to
cure diseases by infinitesimal globules in consequence of having merely
a clerical notion of a cure. It is not, perhaps, too much to say that
this is what may be denominated a clerical error. No doubt the
Clergy ought to practise as well as preach; but their practice ought to

opposition to the parish doctor.

IT'S ALL OWING TO THE WAR I
& S the Reform Bill has been post-
poned in consequence of the
war, we know numerous in-
stances of persons, who, fol-
lowing the example of LorD
John, have availed themselves
of a similar excuse for deferrin
several other cases of intende
* reform.
Several officers have been
compelled to leave without
settling their bills. The war
engrossed all their attention-
they had not time to attend
to them.
A family of distinction, re-
siding in Pentonville, does not
intend, this season, giving its
usual parties, which were the
resort and admiration of all
Pentonville. How is it pes-
sible for people to dance with
a war hanging over their
heads?
MRs. JENKINs, of Ely Place,
has put down her one horse-
killer. With a war, likely to
increase the price of every-
thing, it is best to begin economising at once.
The Lions for the vacant es in Leicester Square have been
sent back to the Zoological atélier whence they came. Though per-
fectly finished, it would be highly injudicious to put them up during
a time of war. -
The City Corporation had serious intentions of reforming themselves,
but the commencement has been deferred until the war is over.
The British Museum had intended pushing on most vigorously the
eve of being convulsed with a general war is not the best adapted for
such a peaceful undertaking, the intention has been indefinitely
postponed.
fiere was a distant talk of the creditors of the DUKE OF YORK
receiving a part payment of their claims; but the war has put a stop
to everything of the kind. -
The liberation of the political prisoners in France has been postponed
for a similar reason. -
... The Morning Herald º; suddenly awake to the absurdity of
its Second Editions, which only lead it into ridiculous mistakes, has
coine to the resolution of not printing any more Foreign Intelligence.
This unhappy decision is all owing to the war.
MR. Hupson has determined not to publish his defence until the
war is perfectly concluded. The minds of men are at present too
agitated to give the proper attention to his simple statement.
In the meantime bakers, butchers, tallow-chandlers, milkmen, poul-
terers—all tradesmen, in short—will increase their prices, and you will
see the excuse for the increase will be invariably put down to the
war, just as if war had not enough to answer for on its own account;

Orrors
A BEGINNING AT ALL EVENTS.
THE inquiry into MR. HUDson's life, “from the cradle up to the
present moment,” has already commenced under the auspices of some
enthusiastic friends. Success has so far attended their efforts that
they have already discovered the identical “cradle” in which MR.
Hudson was nursed. On examination, it turned out to be a “cradle”
such as is used at the Diggings. This is not an inapt beginning,
forming, as it doubtless ã, the emblematical foundation of the
honourable Fºllº. prosperous career. It could not have pre-
sented itself in a º: form. A small quantity of gold was still
found in the cradle, and is supposed to have formed part of the toys
that MR. Hudson played with in his infancy. The gold, upon being
tested, was discovered to be not of the purest description. A consider.
able proportion of iron was detected in it.
A Questionable Move.
THE LORD CHANCELIOR has brought into the House of Peers a Bill
for the transference of Testamentary Jurisdiction from Doctors' Com:
mons to the Court of Chancery. It is to be hoped that Executors and
Legatees will not find this change equivalent to getting out of the
ºr into the fire.

MAXIMS ON ECONOMY.
(Picked up in the Bankruptcy Court.)
IN those interesting annals of the cheating and the cheated, which
are recorded every day in the reports of the Bankruptcy Court, we
met, on Monday the {3}, with the following suggestive paragraph,
which we instantly extracted:—
“A Pocket-Book was produced, which Count DUNIN had presented to him, and
which contained maxims for enforcing the necessity of economy, the reading of which
caused much laughter in Court.”
We are sorry we were not present to have joined in the amusement;
but, as we can easily imagine the nature of the information given, we
beg, for the benefit of all peasons of an easy, confiding, verdant nature
to append the following
CHOICE MAXIMS ON ECONOMY.
(BY A FRENCH count.)
A haunch of venison upon credit is cheaper than a mutton-chop that
you have to pay ready money for.
Borrow much, and lend little. This maxim may be called the Height
of Economy. Practise it largely, and you are sure to grow rich.
. The most expensive article you can wear is a coat out of elbows...It
is extraordinary the number of odd things you never dreamt of that
you will be called upon to pay in consequence of that coat, -
The most economical dinner is when you invite a creditor to dine
with you; but be sure you dine at Richmond, or Greenwich, or the
Clarendon. Be sure the dinner is the best. -
When a person fecla he is getting poorer and poorer, it is high time
he should start his carriage.
Never allow your face to express what your pocket feels. The more
the latter is pinched, the more the former should smile. The Spartan
outh would not allow any one to see a wolf was gnawing his vitals:
with you, if you cannot keep the wolf out of your interior, at all
events do not let the world know it.
What is friendship? Too frequently the wooden handle to a bill!
The man who has many friends is either a great fool, or a great
ave.
Cards either make the fortune of a man, or ruin him. It all depends
upon whether he has money or no money. - - -
The worst extravagance is drinking. The man who drinks is sure to
lose his head. Never put wine on the table, unless it is the card-
table, and then it isn’t for you to partake of it.
THE CLAIRVOYANCE OF NICHOLAS.
(To the Editor of the Zoist.)
MY DEAR SIR,
- . If you deem the following case, worthy of insertion in ſº
interesting periodical, you are quite at liberty to publish it, and, in
connection with it, to make use of my name, should you think that of
any consequence.
Icholas Romanoff, aged 58, has for a long time given indications
of mental derangement. For years it has been notorious amongst his
personal acquaintance that he believes himself to be a sort of Messiah,
commissioned to extirpate infidelity and liberalism. -
He is now in a state not distinguishable from sleep-walking, in which
he is subject to alternate moods of despondency and excitement. In
the former he expresses the most gloomy apprehensions that people are
conspiring toºssassinate him; in the latter he preaches to those about
him, and interards his homilies with passages of Scripture; , These are
taken from the Latin Vulgate, with which it is believed to be quite
impossible that he could have had any previous acquaintance. This
display, therefore, of a faculty apparently supernatural, causes the
greatest astonishment.
We, of course, know that this extraordinary manifestation of the
organ of language is one of the phenomena of lucidity: though whether
the patient has, in the popular sense of the phrase, any lucid intervals,
may be questioned. -
he cure of this case could, no doubt, be readily accomplished by
Mesmerism. But it would be necessary to mesmerise at a distance;
for until a decided influence had been established, any near approach
to the patient would be unsafe. The object, therefore, is to find some-
body sufficiently in rapport with him for that purpose. IORD ABERDEEN
is supposed to have been so once; I wonder if he is still. -
. NESSELRoDE has tried Turning upon Romanoff; but finds it quite
impossible to turn him. The Satanic theory has been proposed by
some superstitious persons to account for the case; in which it is
clear, however, that there is no possession more diabolical than that
which NIGHolas has taken of the Principalities.
The application of metals has not been attended with success; but of
that the reason is obvious. Instead of being applied directly to the
No. 663.”

WHAT MRS. GRUNDY SAYS ABOUT OUR
TROUBLES
THERE's always some fantigue to vex and worrit;
Foreigners quarrel—and we suffer for it.
Firstways them French kicks up a revolution;
Next º: Germans wants a constitution.
The Prussians haves a rumpus with the Dames,
Fighting and blowing out each other's brains.
Then there’s the Romans insurrection raising,
And Austria and Hungary all a-blazing.
Here we’d our Chartists and our Irish traitors,
And after that the rot in the purtators;
Then comes the Pope, who wants to take possession,
A-trying on his insolent aggression.
No sooner have we squared accounts with Popey,
Than that old NICK breaks out upon Sinope,
And we must help the Turks, who serves Mahomet;
No wonder every day there’s some new comet !
So into war they drag us, Mºnº
Oh! I’ve no patience with 'em—they’re so silly,
Bringing upon us such expense and trouble !
Already there’s the Income Tax made double.
And how, when war has shut out Russian tallow,
Shail we be off for soap, white, brown, or yallow *
Of course.’t will ruin us almost in candles;
And bristles will be wanting for brush-handles.
Flax will be scarce, which linen's price must bring up
And so will hemp-save every bit of string up!
No furs—no º: boa, muff, to warm us,
But at a figure that will be enormous.
No hides-Four boots and shoes will soon be frightful!
Oh! I declare it makes me feel quite spiteful.
And pitch and tar will be as dear as leather.
Tar?—yes, I’d tar him—that old Czar—and feather!
From being feathered guards and gates may bar him
But let JACK TAR pitch into him—he'll tar him.
That’s what I says as often as I waxes,
Indignant at war-prices and war-taxes,
NICK puts you to expense and to taxation;
So vent your rage on him for consolation.
Since you must pay to fight him—drat and dash him —
Pay with a good will—pay enough to thrash him,

I hope and trust we're paying for his ruin.

THE PEDIGREE OF A HOUSE.
WE notice that a publisher in Fleet Street
all nounces
“A Genealogical and Chronological Chart of the Royal
and Distinguished Houses of Europe. Traced from ADAM
to the Present Time,” &c.
We must say that the gentleman digs very
deep for his Houses. If the foundation of our
house was no sounder than that on which the
above are built, we should be sorry to live in it.
The author must be a most speculative builder,
and we are only afraid, that, like many builders
of the present day, he will ruin himself with his
speculations. “Traced from ADAM l’” He leaps
boldly over, the , Deluge, though you would
imagine that a slight accident like that would
have washed away all traces, even in the ºf
line. What are the premises, pray, upon whic
he founds his wonde stories, stories as high
as those of the Tower of Babel, and about as
substantial?, We wish he would point to them
—we should like to see the precise ground.
Such a building plot would turn out to be far
more ingenious than the plot of any French
comedy But we have no doubt, that this vera-
cious gentleman, if properly provoked, would
bring forward the title deed ºven of 'Aºs
house, and would show us a fine coloured auc-
tioneer's view of the exterior, brass plate, door-
knocker, area-railings, and all. This is the more
probable, as it is well known that ADAM, and his
ancestors did not live in tents, or in the open
air, but in well-built, imposing, stuccoed houses,
with French windows, such as we see in the
Kilburn Road.

New Relation of Royalty.
THE Hampshire º reporting a complaint against a pawn-
broker named LEE, made at the Southampton Petty Sessions, mentions
that MR. LEE is known in the Court as the “Pawnbroker to HER
MAJESTY.” Some former Sovereigns of England may have had occasion
for the assistance of such a personage, whose connection with Royalty
was notorious in a higher Court than that of Petty Sessions. The
time, however, has gone by when the Crown and Sceptre were liable,
on emergency, to ascend the spout. In the mean time we may observe

* EDUCATED DRAYMEN.”
AMONG the arts of advertising, we observe that the Fine Arts are
taking their place, and Yº. painting are beginning to lend their
aid to puffery., . We have just received an elaborately illustrated
Circular of a suburban Brewery, inviting our attention to a yariety of
beers through the medium of a series of artistic sketches. In one of
these Plenty is represented, in the act of offering about a pound of
hops to Industry, while on the other side of the picture we find Youth
busy over a mash-tub, flower down we perceive Age in a state of
hilarity, arising from a supposed state of beer; and, the series of
illustrations terminates with an allegorical design, in which the most
striking objects are a glass of ale, a pot of porter, and a hop-pole.
We have no º to the alliance between the Fine and the
beer-barrel; nor do we see why the same pencil that draws a landsca
may not draw a pot of beer, but we must ask, an explanation of a
certain paragraph in the Circular, which tells us that
“The Draymen engaged are of a new and superior class.”
We must own that we cannot see any necessary connection between
the quality of the Draymen, and the quality of the beer; nor do we
think we should quaff our “heavy” with any additional gusto because
it might have happened to have been brºught to Qur doors by an
Qxford or Cambridge, man, instead of, by one of BARCIAY and
PERKINs's regulars. We are not disposed to encourage an aristocrac
of Draymen, and, indeed, it is not likely that anybody receiving a cas
of beer will ask the Draymen “in” to talk over the literary topics of
the day, or even the news in general. The Proprietors of the suburban
Brewery think, evidently, anything but small beer of themselves, what-
ever they may think of the beverage º º to their customers.
The motto of this establishment for the intellectual supply of ale
should be Ale-re Flammam /
A CURIOSITY OF LITERATURE.
In Spain the poor Editors are being, transported in dozens. In
France, a Cabinet Council is held to discuss the propriety of sup:
pressing all newspapers in, Paris but two. We expect that in a short
time there will not be an Editor to be seen in Europe—out of England.
An English Editºr will be able to earn a large sum of money by
exhibiting himself to foreigners. Fancy the Editor of the Morning
Herald “on view, from ten till dusk.” The Exhibition, we fancy,
would be not only popular, but highly, remunerative, the more
especially, if an announcement, were to be previously made, that
“about Eleven the Editor will receive, by extraordinary courier,

LATIN LESSON FOR NICHOLAS.
As the EMPEROR of Russia is so fond of quoting Latin, perhaps
the following statement of the Austrian correspondent of the Times
may suggest to his Majesty a somewhat apt citation in that language:
“In order to induce his irregular troops to show more mercy to the Russians, OMAR
PAshA has offered a price for every living prisoner.”
. Fas est et ab hoste doceri is the familiar scrap of Latinity which the
circumstance above related may occasion the Czar to come out with,
to the amazement of his courtiers. It is as much as to say, dearest,
that the champion of the (Greek) Cross will do well to take a lesson
from the defender of the Crescent. Perhaps his Imperial Majesty will
order, it to be appended by way of moral to the drama now in course of
§. repetition at the theatres of St. Petersburg—the Tragedy of
Inope.

Hair. We have not seen it; but if the author has treated the subject
fairly, he must have divided the Human Hair into several millions of
distinct heads. We have some idea of writing a sort of companion
treatise to that on Human Hair, under the title of Bald Facts.

Green Peas—peas of vivid
greenness, of size, mag-
nitude, and softness, the
most remarkable—afforded a succulent and savoury feast the other evening to a
large party at the Darlington Mechanics' Institute–Marrowfats we may well
term these wonderful Green Peas; and indeed it would hardly be too much to say
that the Marrowfats were perfectly Marrowfatuous. -
Mr. Henry Pease—who must allow us to call him MARRowrats—is reported
to have given, on the occasion and at the place referred to, a lecture on the subject
of his recent visit to Russia as a joint bearer of the olive-branch from the Society
of Friends to the Enemy. It does not appear to have occurred to MARROWPATs to
congratulate himself and his companions on not having, in any very disagreeable
sense, got hold of the wrong end of that pacific stick which they had the courage-
all honour and credit to them for that—to extend to the Czar,
“What,” demands the proverbial philosophy of the million, “can, you expect
from a hog but a grunt?” With equal reason it may be asked, what can you
expect from another omnivorous animal, but a hug, of a very different nature
from a friendly embrace. It is not, therefore, wonderful that owfats was
agreeably º: by his reception at the Court of St. Petersburg; according to
the report of his lecture: which states that
“Arrived at the Palace of the Czar he described the magnificence of the Palace, and the gracious
reception accorded them by the Emperor.”
No doubt the Quakers found the Imperial Robber avery nice-spoken man. There
have been some gentlemanly highwaymen. Certain heroes of Nursery Romance also-
we seem to remember—found some of the Giants and Ogres, into whose castles they
had penetrated, extremely affable; the monsterÉ: his visitor many fair words, and
entertaining him with great politeness and cordiality. And yet, says MARRowrats:
“While at St.Petersburgh the terribleslaughter at Sinope was performed at the theatres every night.”
Against the wish of the gracious Emperor? The Press is under tolerable
restriction in Russia—as owfats laments. Is there no censorship of the
stage? Was the Autocrat of all the Russias unable to prevent the managers of
the St. Petersburgh, theatres from glorifying a horrid and barbarous massacre
MARRowfats should think so, considering, as he does, that Sovereign to be
calumniated by British journalists. For
“MB. Pease said, no one cherished more ardently than himself the love for the freedom of the
press in England; but he was exceedingly grieved and humbled at the course which the press in
England had pursued in reference to the Eastern question—in resorting to abuse and calumny against
the Czar, instead of reasoning calmly, and appealing to sound argument."
Does MARRowPATs imagine that reasoning however calm, and argument however
sound, would have saved us from having to come to the ultimate reason and the
final effort of argumentation? The softness and greenness of MARRowPATs appear
sufficient for that imagination too, inasmuch as:
“He could not believe but that theimpressions which were communicated to the public by the press,
were entirely erroneous and unfounded as regarded the Emperor and Empress. The effect which these
misrepresentations had produced on the mind of both was painfully apparent."
Who has ever accused the Empress of tyranny, cruelty, rapine, fraud, and
utterance of the thing which is not ? The EMPREss of Russia must have made
herself very ious to owfats to induce him to come out thus as the
champion of her fame, apropos of her Imperial husband's boots. Surely she
immed some extraordinary favour to the buttonless coat. To conclude: Friend
owfats affirms that
“From what he saw of the Emperor and Empress, he was convinced that the estimationin which the
former was held here was incorrect. He believed that the Czar was kind and temperate.”
It has never yet, we believe, been insinuated that the civil courses and passions
of the Czar are occasioned by habitual drunkenness. As to his humanity, how does
MARRowrats reconcile that with the actual Sinope in the first place, and its dramatic
repetition every evening—till further notice, presumably. By the by, MARRowPATs
ought to go to the Play—’tis a pity that attendance at thea-
tricals should be contrary to the drab cloth. He would there
learn.what acting is, and see how ferociousand astute tyrants
can cajole andwheedle simple gulls., MARRowPATs at least
might read SHAKSPEARE in his chime -corner, and be
thereby taught that a manmay,"smile, and smile, and be a .

palm of the vilest falsehood and cloak the darkest †.
MARRowfats has been buttered with the butter of an
Emperor; he has been soaked to stultification in the
Imperial butter. When next moved to bear testimony
to the “humanity” of the EMPEROR or Russia, , let
ow FATs imagine himself at Sinope, and consider how
he would have liked being shelled.

AS GOOD AS A PANTOMIME.
The Cear-Clown. “I Don't MEAN ANY HARM, PAROLE DE GENTLEMAN | *—(Wide Russian Correspondence).
THE SOLDIER'S DREAM.
OH sad was my heart as for marching we mustered,
For I thought of the wife I was leaving behind
And the six hungry mouths round their mother that clustered,
With bread at high price, and with work hard to find.
On my watch aboard ship, standing sentry ashore,
By the bivouac fire, still that thought would pursue;
Till I dreamed a glad dream—and was sorry no more—
'Twas the time of the night when they say dreams are true.
I dreamed that I saw the poor babes I’d forsaken,
And her whom too soon a sad mother I’d made,
Looking still, as she looked, when that last leave was taken,
Not knowing from whom to seek counsel or aid.
I heard their shrill cry as they asked her for bread,
Heard her answer—“The bread of the parish or none !”
Saw them shivering for cold on a blanketless bed,
And crouched round a hearth whence the last spark was gone.
When sudden, with look like an ºf: of grace,
And hands that bore raiment and firing and food,
I saw a kind lady come into the place
To cheer my sad wife and her clamorous brood.
“Take, eat, and be warm; ’tis the offering of friends,”
She said; “not the dole on the pauper bestowed;
It comes from the country your husband defends,
Which to you pays a debt that to him it feels owed.
“His heart will be stouter, his arm will be stronger,
When he knows that his children are clothed, taught, and fed;
That his wife lives in dread of the workhouse no longer,
To the shame of the country for which he has bled” .
Then I cried in my sleep, “Take the soldier's thanksgiving !”
When lo: the réveillé proclaimed break of day; .
And I stood to my arms with a heart free from grieving,
All fears for my wife and my babes chased away.
A WARNING STORY FOR LORD DERBY.
LoRD DERby has avowed his chivalrous determination to run at the
Press, when offended by the light cast abroad by it upon any subject
that, as his Lordship believes, ought to remain in sacred obscurity.
For the timely instruction and benefit of Lord DERBY, Mr. Punch
humbly begs permission to relate to him a true story. (See Newspapers
at PEELE's Coffee-house).
About two—it may be three, it surely is not four-years ago, there
was a bull pastured in a field skirting a railway. ...The bull—a weakness
with bulls in general—had a high sense of his dignity. It may be, he
was a bull of long descent, come down to us from the grand old bulls
of the Caledonian Forest. Be this as it may, the bull had—it was
believed—been much annoyed by, the rattling, and bellowing, and
smoking, and steaming of the railway-train, that would him:
contemptuously pass him—on wheels of thunder. “ §º a bull,
permit this?’ asked TAURUs, as was thought from the sequel, “By
no means. ... I will—when next disturbed-pitch into the train—run
at it—toss it off the rail—throw it into infinite space.”
The night-train appeared; and, by way of mockery of the magnificent
bull, carried two flaming red lights! Now the bull had a natural
disgust of everything put forth that was red... Whereupon, true to his
determination, but further stimulated by the new insult—the bull
threw up his tail, lowered his head, shut his eyes—and ran full butt at
the railway train.
And the train, in one moment, knocked every puff of breath out of
the body of the bull, that lay so much beef upon the railway.
The house of DEKBY is famous for its breed of cocks. Let his Lord-
ship take heed lest, he complete the tale; making the story a double
story of a Cock and a Bull.
Wild Oats.
“WE have all our wild oats to sow,” says the Times, on gaming.
Very good; only unfortunately the oats of the simpleton make the
dirty bread of the scoundrel.

PRECAUTION
|N WAYS AND MEANS.
olon EL SIBTHORP often puts
the Government a question
which it is difficult to an-
swer. ... Take, for instance,
the following:—
“Why, during the most natural
public anxiety and suspense in the
3. state of things, and the
eclaration of HER MAJESTY's
Government, particularly so the
CHANCELLon of THE Exchequer,
of the necessity of doubling the
Income Tax from 7d. to 10}d. in
the pound on account of the war,
some more direct and positive de-
claration of war has not taken place,
or their assurance that such im-
:...; war will be avoided
altogether?"
RAILWAY CRUELTY TO ANIMALS.
PARLIAMENT has extended protection to animals by certain acts, of
which horses, cats, and even humbler brutes, constantly reap the
benefit. The “ donkey wot won’t (or can't) go” has the benefit of a
most wholesome section of a very stringent measure, which consigns to
prison any ferocious “BILL BURN" who may be disposed
Whilst crying out his greens,
To wollop his donkey with all his means;"
for even more than BuBN's justice may now be done upon the offending
individual.
While, however, we highly approve of the law in question, which
enables the cat to pass its nine lives in comparative comfort, we are
glad to find that the Cruelty. Prevention Society of Armagh is about to
extend, its operations to the case of travellers by railway. It is
creditable to the men of Armagh that, while protecting the lower
order of animals, man is not forgotten; and, though there is, probably,
These are the terms as
reported in the Times, of all
interrogation of which a
notice been placed on
the “votes” by the honour-
able and gallant Member for Lincoln. What the Colonel meant to ask
probably was:–Why, if Ministers considered it necessary to increase
the Income Tax on account of war, they have not declared war, and if
there is to be no war wº don’t they say so? The drift of these
demands is plain enough. he Colonel, who has no confidence in the
Government—“particularly so the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER”
—evidently suspects that HER MAJESTY's Ministers in general, an
MR GLApstone in particular, have availed themselves of the alarm of
war for the purpose of procuring an addition to the tax on income: in
other words, of obtaining an increased Income Tax, under false pre-
tences. , Coton EL SIBTHoRP also, no doubt, thinks that the tax once
obtained will be permanent—that if one pretext for its imposition
should cease, another would be found for its continuance. In the
former of these suppositions charity forbids us to, coincide with the
Colonel; but experience compels us to endorse the latter.
Without clairvoyance, by or waking vision, it was foreseen
by the least wide-awake, that the promised diminution, and subsequent
i. i*i; the Income Tax, would, somehow, or other, never take
place. owever desirable the Succession Duty may, have been in
itself, there is no doubt that every gentleman who voted for it in any
belief in the promise of its superseding the Income Tax, was a silly
gentleman. - - - - - -
In the event, which it is to be feared is too probable, of the proposed
increase of taxation being demonstrated, even to ColoneL SIBTHORP,
to be necessitated by existing circumstances, the Colonel—or any
other member—will do good service by moving some resolution whereof
the effect shall be to prevent cheerful submission to the cost of a just
and necessary war from being mistaken for passive endurange of con-
fiscation. Some three hundred thousand persons have now the honour
of carrying on the war with the EMPEROR OF Russia, They are to
furnish its sinews out of their incomes. The nation will assert itself
at their expense. The provision which would otherwise, be made for
adversity by the industrious who earn a precarious livelihood, is to be
seized upon as funds for fighting the Czar. This must be borne—as
ublicans are obliged to bear the having soldiers billeted on them–
§. with grinning—for a time. But the wry faces are as necessary
as the patience. the teeth are not shown while the extortion is
endured, the exaction will have no end. Fashionable Finance consists
in fixing the screw where there is the least resistance; and ºf
till the clamour of the suffering class becomes intolerable-or t
something cracks!
JOHN SMITH TO THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL.
“HonourED AND LEARNED SIR,
“WoucasAFE, through the favour of Mr. Punch, to º:

“Hells’ of London makes the giving a false name an offence to be

the ler Fitznormancross, or Heronsplume, or Eagleswing, to

much abused name of -- Yours, JoHN SMITH.”
JUST THE TERM FOR IT, HConsidering the height at which Shirt
Collars are now worn, we think the present may indeed be called a

not a human being too exalted for the fellow feeling of an association

the benevolence that would hold an umbrella over the duck that may
have been “ ..º. caught in a shower,” and decline to interfere on
behalf of human suffering. The mode in which our third-class railway
travellers are treated is a scandal to an age which legislates for the
comfort of a cab-horse, and places water-troughs along the Strand for
the benefit of any lost .# or idle dog that may feel disposed to take
to drinking in that crowded locality. e do not, by any means, disap-
prove of these thoughtful arrangements for a thirsty metropolitan
i." or a peculiarly dry dog; but we object to the exclusion of
human beings from the benefit of the acts against cruelty to animals. It is,
certainly, as cruel to expose a number of thinly clad women and children
to rain and wind for several hours on a railway train, as it is to exact
§: unhappy donkey more than a fair day's work for a fair day's
1Sules.
We should have no fear but that the existing law would be sufficient
to meet any case of cruelty to a human being, if common sense were to
be the guide by which it would be interpreted; but as long as we have
i. who look at º instead of at principles, who ask what
as been said from the Bench a hundred years *. instead of thinking
what ought to be said at the present day, we shall not be surprised to
find it “settled” that “man is not an animal.”

NICHOLAS HIMSELF AGAIN.
FROM the “secret correspondence”, which has lately been di
to us, we find that in his “confidential” interviews with SIR
HAMILTON SEYMoUR, the EMPEROR expressly wished it understood
that his proposals were made “on the word of a gentleman.” We
confess that we were somewhat puzzled, at first to reconcile this wish
with the conduct that accompanied it. On reflection, however, we
remembered that-
“The Prince of Darkness is a Gentleman: ”
and we are therefore not surprised that NICHOLAs should claim that
dignity.

A Book called “The Great Highway,” has been advertised as the

on his honour as a gentleman. He cannot be said
to have had no pretensions to that title; only it
is a pity that Ministers did not know that the
gentleman they had to deal with in NICHOLAs,
was the OLD GENTLEMAN.
“ MAIMED RITES ’’ OF CONSCIENCE.
FROM a letter dated Wrawby, and commencing with “My dear
arishioners,” we learn that a painful act of conscientiousness has
been performed by the vicar of that parish, the REVEREND. J.R.
West. That reverend gentleman asserts himself to have, made this
exertion from principle, and out of real charity, and says that it cost
him “a great deal of pain, and trouble indeed.” is sacrifice o
feeling to duty consisted in the refusal to allow the body of a deceased
Methodist—a MRs. SMITH, according to the Lincolnshire Times, wife of
MR. Edward SMITH, ironmonger, that was to have been buried at
Wrawby—to enter the church. How peculiarly distressing its perform-
ance must have been to his merely natural sentiments, may appear from
the following passage in his apology, in which, referring his systematic
exclusion of certain corpses from the sacred building to a sense of
right, he asks-
“What other motive could I have had in the last instance, where the family is so
very respectable; where I have never seen or even heard of any of that bitterness of
word or feeling against the Church, which is too plainly manifest in some of this
arish? I have, indeed, a real esteem for that family; they have never given me the
east offence or occasion for any unkind feeling. I acted simply out of kindness and
out of a feeling of duty.”
If MRs. SMITH had been a wicked Duchess, whose pride, luxury,
stinginess, malevolence, and irreligion had been a scandal to the
neighbourhood, who never went, to any place of worship at all, it may
be conceived that a clergyman, though amiable as the Rev. M.R. WEST,
would experience but a moderate wrench of the heartstrings in closin
the holy portals against her unholy remains, in case he thought himself
bound to do so. Tºut MRs. SMITH, the wife of MR. Edward SMITH,
ironmonger, who “ had,” says the Lincolnshire Times, “been a con-
sistent member of the Wesleyan Connection for several years, and died
in the faith of a Christian,” was, at least, a person whose conduct had
rocured her the Rev. MR: West’s “esteem.”. It must, therefore,
have deeply pained him to shut her body out of the church—consider-
what the exclusion meant.
ut if MRs. SMITH died in the Christian faith, she also died in the
º schism; and MR. WEST acts in obedience to the following
e:-
“They who have regularly forsaken the Church during their lifetime should not be
admitted within the walls of the church at their burial.”
But, # whom was this Rule decreed? By one of the Nicene
Councils?—by the Council of Chalcedon P-at least by the Hampton
Court Conference, or perhaps by Convocation under JAMEs I. P. By
#|of Wrawby-cum-Brigg, convoked by MR.
no such authority; to judge from the information afforded on the
subject by MR. WEST to his “dear Parishioners:”
“As some of you have told me that º think me wrong in having made a certain
rule about the Burial of Dissenters, and that many attribute to me very wrong
à. I wish to explain to you what were my real reasons and motives for making
that rule."
Hence it appears that this Rule, or Canon, was framed by the §.
- West, whereat MR. WEST
presided, and which consisted of the REv. M.R. WEST.
In making this “Rule,” MR. WEST contends that he qught, at the
very worst, to be thought mistaken. That may be granted; he writes
in a vein of Puseyite pathos evidently sincere. But was he not grossly
mistaken in convoking, and ...; and superintending, and
obeying the Synod of Wrawby-cum-Brigg
§ WEST cannot believe
“That Dissent is lawful, that to split up into ten or a dozen separate bodies in every
Parish is agreeable to the principles of the Christian religion.”
Does MR. WEST not remember that the whole Parish of Christendom
was split up into ten or a dozen º: bodies, more or less, three
hundred years ? “If I could believe that Dissent is lawful.” he
declares, “ tºould give up my Rule at once.”. If it is not lawful
to dissent from the PARson of WRAwBY, was it lawful to dissent
from the Pope of RQME *
With seeming justice, certainly, MR. WEST observes :—
“I have only to add that it does seem to me a most unreasonable thing that people
who regularly forsake the Church in their life-time should so much desire to be taken
within the walls of the church at their burial."
No doubt;W." there is a dissenting chapel in the churchyard.
Would MR. WEST be willing to allow one in his P the meanwhile
clergymen who refuse the dissenting body church-room after death
might as well decline to accept church-rates from it during life.

MUSICAL CRITICISM, WITH SPECIMENS.
- - n
R. PUNCH has re-
ceived a greatbatch
of new music. He
has not the slight-
est idea why it
should be sent to
him, but several
strong ideas why it
should not. The
only object, so far
as he can under-
stand, with which
music is sent to a
periodical is that
the latter may puff
the former more or
less outrageously.
Well, puffing is un-
happily not much
in Mr. Punch's way;
but, besides this, it
really appears to
him a great waste
of paper, nicely
printed with musi-
cal characters, and
embellished with
frontispieces of
greater or less absurdity, to send it to him or any other honest
reviewer when every music publisher appears to keep A. clerk ex-
pressly to write reviews of the “house's" publications. What is the
use of a bit of sound opinion, when there is a fluent Young gen-
tleman ready with a cut and dry paragraph to fit anything, his master
may publish? “Of all the exquisite gems which even the heaven-born
fancy of the gifted Buggins has produced, this is at once the mot
. ing, the most captivating, and withal the easiest for the player.”

earned our presumption in listening to ‘Diamonds of the Brain.” And
then these counter, critics have another advantage. While they are
forging a criticism they invent a journal for it, and specimens of papers
which neither we nor the Stamp Office ever heard of are daily advertised
as coolly as if such papers had existence. This is prudent. Qur friend
the Musical World, for instance, is very honest; and despite his extreme
fatuousness in contending that fiddlers are not, habitually, fools, gives
legitimate opinions on music, and we never see his name attached to
any publisher's puffing. But we read of the Musical Jargo, and the
Musical Slaverer, and the Musical Trowel, and the Musical Toadcaſſer,
and a score of similar works, and on the strength of such frauds helpless
young ladies who look down the advertising columns to see what new
lieces they shall buy are deluded into the purchase of rubbish. And
}. the young gentleman grims when they walk into his master's shop,
and say they will take the “Cloud of Harmonies,” or the “Bilious
Girl's Prayer,” because “they see it is spoken very well of by the
press.” What, therefore, is the use of sending new music to Mr.
Punch *
However, as it has come, he will look at it. It º to have been
in a great measure inspired by recent events, nearly all of it having
relation to the Oriental question. The first which comes to hand is—
“ Up with the Union-Jack, Crescent, and Tricolor!” A
dedicated to OMER PAshA. Poetry by ALCIBIADES
by HAYDN Jorriwops.
We do not think we like this poetry—much.
boldness belongs to a martial subject.
“Up with the Union-Jack, Crescent, and Tricolor,
ºil; the flags shall in harmony join,
Teaching the haughty Russ champion to break a law
Which to keep sacred he ought to combine.
Charge on him, sons of the Thames and the Isis,
Charge on him, sons of the Seine and the Rhone,
Showing you're equal to cope with this crisis,
By *i; a firm and a resolute tone.
“Fear not his millions of Moscovite legions;
Are they not slaves who can never be free?
While you are proud of the noble allegiance
You owe to #cil, France and the isle of the Sea.
So dash up the Danube with all your three-deckers,
And, lashing its billows to fury and foam,
Let all the dark mountains resound with your echoes

Yet it is bold, and

If we were hypercritical we might object to the rhyme to “tricolor 2
which rhyme, if read “breek a lore,” as is necessary, ridicules Čock-
meyism. Next we object to “join’ and “combine.” Thirdly, we want
somebody with whom NICHOLAs should combine. Fourthly, we think
the seventh and eighth lines slightlyº: Fifthly, we do not think
Nick, has, millions of legions, or if he has why, they are not to be
feared, and why they are to rhyme to “allegiance.” Sixthly, we want
to know how a three-decker is to be got up into the Danube; and
Seventhly, we object to the translation of “strike home.” But, on
the whole, the song has only the faults of its class, and is so like the
majority of such works, and the music (being stolen from MEYER-
BEER) is so good, that we are happy to recommend it. The next is
sentimental.
“Her Guardsman's where, on Danube's Bank.” Song. The Poetry by
the HoNour ABLE AUGUSTUs Nobhead, the Music by MRs. Auto-
Lycus CABBAGE DE CRIBB.
“IIer Guardsman's where, on Danube's bank,
The Moslem walks his round,
And though her loved one's sword may clank
She cannot hear the sound.
For many a day her cheek will pale,
From his dear sight debarred,
And many a night she’ll still bewail
For that young Coldstream Guard.
“But Time, it is a wondrous thing,
And passes day by day,
And after winter comes the spring,
To smile the storm away.
And oh some day that healt may gain
Its pure and rich reward,
And those bright eyes look, not in vain,
For that young Coldstream Guard.”
The lady's music is in every way worthy of the gentleman's poetry,
and as the publisher, who naturally knows so much more about these
things than we can, observes, “There is a touching and a pellucid
mingling of gentle sorrow and of elevated hope about this song, which
must recommend it alike to the pianoforte of the general player, and of
the fastidious Christian.”
The third Song with which we have been favoured has what the
writer supposes to be a local colouring about it. . A very little of such
colour, and that not over well put on, is enough in these days. It is
“Oh were I but a Pasha's Bride /?” Song by a Young Lady of Rank.
Music by SIGNOR Volti SUBIto, principal Harpist to the QUEEN
oF THE CANNIBAL IsI.ANDs.
“Oh were I but a Pasha's bride,
I'd love his bridle rein,
And I would ever seek his side
Upon the battle plain.
And when the dreadful fight was done,
I’d deck his gay kiosk, , .
Or mix his sherbet, scour his gun,
Or go with him to mosque.
“And when his mutes the fearful knives,
Or cords of death, should bring,
My tears should save the victim’s lives,
ſy beau relax the string.
And I would brush his crimson fez,
And stick it on one side—
I care not what my mother says,
I’d be a Pasha's bride.”
As regards this precocious young lady, whose ideas of a Pasha's
domestic arrangements are so accurate, we can only say that, though
possibly we might be inclined to spoil the child in the way not recom-
mended by SolomoN, we should certainly remit her to a course of dry
toast and water and collects. As for SIGNor Wolti SUBIto, we
recommend him to turn º to some other profession than music-
making :-stone-breaking would supply his ear with all the liveliness
it seems to covet.
We find a mass of other songs in the parcel, but have no space to
do more than enumerate them. There is the “Sultan's Triumph, a
Country Dance;” “When Britain Storms the Iron Gate;” “The Guards
are Gone / How many Hearts;” “The Barrack Halls are Vacan/ Noto ;”
“The Fusileers on the Danube, a March ;” “Let England's Ships in
Thunder Roar;” “Pop Goes the Cannon;” “England, Old Tyranny's
Foe;” “Beautiful Sisters, the Thames and the Seine;” “Join, France
and England, Hand in Iland,” &c. &c. We may deal with them at
some future period; in the mean time, we doubt not to see them puffed
every day, according to publishers' custom, with choice laudations,
‘French, frapper ches vous P and ‘Bold Britons, strike home.” 'shop manufacture, and carefully selected from non-existent journals.

on. All that may be very true; but then what is to become of the
class I belong to? We are numerous and respectable; particularly
so. All laws, latterly, have been made for the benefit of theo posite
class of Fº sn't this what you call legislating for the few

hav'n't been brought up to it? Because we can’t digest knowledge
as some can, that is no reason why we should starve. Respect the
vested interests of aldermen and people like that ? Then, I say,
respect the vested interests of Dunces. If there are to be examina.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI

R. PUNCH.
UR readers will ac-
quit us of ever
wandering , into
prosaic details
or self-laudation.
But there is a cir-
cumstance con-
nected with the
recent publication
of the Secret Cor-
respondence be-
tween the Govern:
ment of England
and her represent-
ative at St. Peters-
burg, which, un-
less we state it,
will probably es-
onpe general at-
tention, and to
* which in justice
to ourselves we
are inclined very
briefly to advert.
We do so, less for
the sake of record-
ingany superiority
of our own, than
for the sake of an-
swering the hundreds, we might write thousands, of correspondents
who, finding that we are invariably and infallibly right, not only in our
j. ublic events, but in our predictions for the future,
unceasingly speculate upon the question whether the Government, for
the time being, supplies us with secret information, to be used at
our discretion. §: are perfectly aware that the public, seldom
deceived in its judgment, is justified in attributing our almost pre-
ternatural knowledge to sources not open to the world. And we
unhesitatingly admit this to be the case. We are above the affectation
of disclaiming connection with the Executive, and we cºnceive that in
plainly avowing that we are received into the confidence of the
Administration, we pay the good sense of the latter a compliment
which will materially conduce to its popularity. - -
The circumstance to which we are about to refer is this:-The
Secret Correspondence, which everyone has read, and which discloses
the whole of the designs of the Emperor of Russia upon Turkey, was
laced in, our hands at a time when the eyes of the nation, were
fºil; sealed to the fact that such documents were in existence.
We shall simply place two facts before our readers, and leave them to
form, their own decision. In examining the Secret Correspondence,
we lighted, of course, upon the famous passage regarding the Sick
Man, the type under which Turkey was alluded to by Nicholas. The
following are the words:—
“We have on our hands a Sick Man—a very Sick Man; it will be, I tell you
frankly, a great misfortune if, one of these days, he should slip away from us,
pecially before all ry arra s were made."
A LEADING ARTICLE BY M
The passage we ſound was given in the despatch in the original French
of the speaker, which we append, for a reason which will presently
appear:-
“Tenez, nous avons sur les bras un Homme Malade—un Homme gravement
Malade; ce sera, je vous le dis franchement, un grand malheur si, un deces jours, il
º,” échapper, surtout avant que toutes les dispositions necessaires fussent
p -
The above extracts comprise one of the facts to which we invite
attention. We proceed to the other. - -
It became most, essential that the attention of French and English
statesmen should be called, in the most impressive manner, to the
desi of Russia. At the same time it was impossible for us to
allude to the Secret Correspondence in a way to excite the suspicion
of the public. We were not, of course, in a position enabling us to do
so. But what we did was this. We took the idea of the Sick Man,
and so, treated it, that, while those who had read the Secret Cor-
dence could not ſail, to see that we illustrated the passage in
question, the public would simply recognise in our engraving a startling
roduction of the situation of Turkey and her neighbours. We
er to our cut of the 17th September, 1853, rather more than six
months before the Secret, Correspondence was published. . That
engraving represents the Sick Man,—the sharpened features indeed
emphasizing the phrase, the cery Sick Man. Above him is, Russia,
typified as Death—“if he should slip away from us,” and in the fore-
ground, consulting on the “necessary arrangements,” the “disposi-
tions nécessaires,” are England and France. Why did wº, put France
there? Any one, who will read the latest revelations will see that at
is a beggarly
the time our cut appeared the Russian bribes, scoffed at by England,
had been repeated to France. Is not that an answer?
We shall add little more. The engraving appeared; the attention
both of statesmen and the public was gained; but we violated no
confidence. Six months later the world receives the correspondence.
We could complete this article by other revelations, but let this suffice.
We did our duty; and, if it be to the exertions of Mr. Punch, as is
generally admitted, that Turkey will owe her salvation, he is content
that Nºrmer and Radiº shalf have the triumph. and he will take it
as a particular favour if they will look sharp about it.
THE KINGDOM OF BEGGARS.
THE other day an old impostor, who was charged, at a police court,
with mendicity and mendacity, combined, was described in the report
as “the Queen of the Beggars.” We never yet heard of the Kingdom
or Queendom of beggary, and, we are at a loss, therefore, to know
the origin of the Royalty attributed to the old rogue; who, without
respect to the privileges of crowned heads, was packed off to the
House of Correction for a trimestrial turn at the crank or the tread.
mill. Where there is royalty there is generally an aristocracy; and, if
there exists a beggarly throne, we may naturally presume that there
}. e, with a º ministry, and all the other
ggarly paraphernalia of a state of mendicants. Who is the Prime
Minister of the beggars and may we not find their Lord Chancellor
among some of those diseased limbs of the law whose speedy ampus
tation is desirable for the health of the professional body?... We should
like to know whether the thronc of the beggars is elective or here-
itary, and what becomes of the crown during the interregnum caused
by the committal of its wearer for three months, or any less period, to
the fields of Cold Bath, or any other locality equally calculated to act
as a damper to ambition?
We think the penny-a-liners ought to be careful how they confer
royalty on malefactors, for there are already several crowned delin-
quents scattered over Europe, and any addition to the stock is only
an augmentation of the evils that afflict society. When we look at
Spain with its beggarly and bankrupt condition, and recollect that
there is a queen already ruling over that country of political and
pecuniary paupers, we cannot see why any other Queen of the Beggars
should be constituted. If there is a royalty and an aristocracy of beggars
in this country, there may possibly be a House of Commons, and we
shall be perhaps, hearing of the Speaker of the Beggars, in the shape
of some plausible cadger who is loud in proclaiming his “Shame at
appearing in such a position before his keyind friends and fellow
ristians”—the ignorant nursemaids who, with mistaken benevolence,
pelt him with halfpence from the attics. For what we know there
may be a Parliament of Beggars, and every division of the metropolis
may have its mendicant representatives. How do we know that the
“mechanic” under the lamp-post in the New Cut, “got up” with
chalked face and white apron, is not the “Honourable Member for
Seven. Dials,” and that the elaborately-weeded, widow, with two
bouncing babies in her arms, lying well dosed with laudanum, at the
corner of St. Martin's Church is not a peeress in her own right
in the kingdom or queendom of beggary P
THE ABSOLUTE PHILOSOPHER.
AND so at last the die is cast, and France and England war declare!
With all my heart; for my own part, I don't a single button care.
The worst suppose—that ãº foes my navy should be all destroyed
That won't harm me, so I should be a fool if I were much annoyed.
They'll shell my forts; bombard my ports, perhaps; and devastate my
coasts:
But I shall smile, secure meanwhile, because surrounded by my hosts.
With troops begirt, I shan’t be hurt; so won't concern myself a jot :
Serf piled on serf as well as turf will serve to stop a cannon shot.
I treat as jokes the hardest strokes by sea or land that they can hit,
|For one thing’s clear, I need not fear; they won't affect myself a bit;
BRITANNIA, reign upon the main! let me my savages cºmmand; ... .
Rule thou º waves: give me the slaves, a Czar who like myself will
stan
Paste this up in your Mind.
IET you be ever so pure, you cannot associate with bad companions
without falling into bad odour. Evil company is like tobacco-smoke—
you cannot be long in its presence without carrying away a taint
of it.

The unfortunate individual who is compelled by hard fate to seek

the advertiser was determined on cheapness for mere cheapness sake,
the clerk is required to be “married” as well as badly paid, so that
his salary, and the claims upon it, may be in an inverse ratio. We

nity, while the latter might be one to whom “a living is not so much
an object as a miserable situation in which he may indulge his hypo-

OUR fashionable contemporary, that published the other

“SEIzure of Combustibles.—On Saturday the Officers of Customs seized a vessel

understood that the Government in end to enforce the penalties against the shippers."
This information makes us regret that war was not declared a few
days earlier; in which case the penalties alluded to would, if we
mistake not, have been those of high treason.
The rascals thus ready to supply the enemy with combustibles,
would no doubt be equally willing, for a sufficient consideration, to act
as common incendiaries in the interest of Russia. By the way, as
Nicholas is evidently capable, of anything except the acknowledge-
ment of his mistake, it would be well to keep a sharp look-out in our
dockyards and arsenals, against MEssas. Swing, who are extremely
likely to hold a commission from the “gentleman” called Autocrat of

The Unquestionables.
THE opposition of the Papal y to inquiry into Convents is
rhaps not wonderful, considering the fact, that the priesthood, whose
instruments they are, has always entertained a strong objection to
inquiring minds. We know what happens at Naples and elsewhere to
those who attempt to search the Scriptures, and therefore we can
hardly be surprised at the outcry made here against the proposal for
examining Nunneries. Those who fear the discovery of the truth may
naturally be indignant at the idea of raising the veil.
SOME CREDIt TO THE CZAR.
THE Czar may boast of the 3,000,000 soldiers at his command, but,
although surrounded with so many forces, nevertheless, considering
the shifts } which he has been obliged to raise money, it must be
confessed that he is a loanly man.

MIND YOUR ANTECEDENTS.
We frequently hear of the neglect of their antecedents by certain
politicians; but, considering .#. worth remembering such, ante-
cedents often are, we may pardon a great deal of political oblivion.
An indifference to one's antecedents in grammar is a far more serious
offence, and indeed we have recently been much shocked by a rather
startling announcement in a shop at the West End, where we are told
“The stock is being sold off is consequence, or the death or one of the Firm
with the concurrence of the SURV1VING Partners.”
We are, of course, fully aware that the respectable house to which
we allude has had no hand in the melancholy event which has been the
sl for a “selling off; ” but a disregard to the rules of grammar has
led to the construction of a sentence which might bear a construction
of a very alarming nature. It would appear that “the death of one of
the firm” had taken place “with the concurrence of the ºf
partners,” who are grammatically made accessaries before the fact, wit
which, inorally and physically, they have not had the remotest
connection.
In another instance of disregard to antecedents, we find a person
advertising himself as an “agent for FARINA's Eau de Cologne,”
which, he says, is to be had of himself, “John HALL, IMPORTER OF
LIVE BEARs at 15s. the case of Six, or 2s. 6d. per bottle.” The im:
portation of Live Bears is, of itself, a rather eccentric, occupation; but
the intination that they are to be had “at fifteen shillings the case of
six” Gives the finishing touch to an announcement that scarcely, comes
within the range of bare 1. . Whether any customer is likely to
be found for half-a-dozen bears is ãº. and even if the public could
be offered the temptation of a “single bear at the wholesale price,” we
do not think there are many who would be induced to greet with open
arms so strange a §: We may be told the tradesman meant to
imply that he sells his Eau de Cologne “at 15s. the case of six;” but
that is not the case according to his very ungrammatical advertisement.
THE FINE OLD RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN.
I’LL sing you a novel song, made º a rare old pate,
Of a fine old Russian Gent eman who governed a large state,
And who kept down all his subjects at a furious old rate,
With the fine old despot's practices too shocking to relate;
Like a savage old Barbarian all of the olden time.
His outward man was often dressed in artful smiles and bows;
And with “parole de gentleman” and very specious vows,
Did this Imperial hypocrite—as all the world allows—
Humbug the English Government, and no suspicions rouse,
Like a rare old Barbarian all of the olden time.
Where fierce Siberia's frost and snow, the boldest might appal,
He hurried off by thousands those who at their country’s call
Tried to preserve her liberties from his despotic thrall;
Nor did he favour rank or wealth, but banished great and small,
Like a great old Barbarian, all of the olden tinue.
But tyranny, though strong, must fall. It happened, by the by,
This Russian on a neighbour's land, had cast a longing eye,
And said º England, “Here’s a man that’s sick, and soon must
e :
Some one will get his property, so why not you and I?”
Like a rare old Barbarian, all of the olden time.
Now surely nothing less of this can anyhow be made,
Than right down robbery, which is a very wicked trade;
And º by England and by France the spoiler's hand is stay’d,

THE PRUSSIAN EAGLE'S BEAK.
º Cicatmization has, we hope,
ere this, restored the in-
tegrity of the KING OF
PRussia’s nose, accom-
panied by a cessation of
the febrile symptoms
which arose from the
excoriation of that pro-
tuberance. The reader
of course knows that his
Prussian Majesty, whilst
-walking in the Palace
Gardens at Charlotten-
burg, had the misfortune
torun his royal proboscis
against a tree; thereby
barking the former, if not
the latter: and was laid
up by reason of the acci-
dent with low fever. Out
of evil comes ; and
this casualty, which might
have been followed by
consequences of a deplor-
able nature, may perhaps
lead to the happiest re-
sults. It may impress
the illustrious, sufferer
*º-º-º: = with the expediency of
U. – º Biº- preferring an upright and
- irect to a stooping, and
tortuous course; and, for the future, of adopting a dignified attitude
and walking straight. Not that we mean to insinuate that, the
Monarch was in that state in which the footsteps are devious, and the
vision is double; his disaster is ascribed to mere shortness of sight:
and we trust he will make no more blunders through shortsightedness.

PUNCH AT THE PLAY.
Moss, BAIzac has preached the solemn yet sad truth, to.the
startled ears of all the nations of the earth, that every French wife is
an object of tenderest sympathy to some unmarried sentimental one.
In some cases, the lady is in the condition of the large-hearted gentle-
womanin the old song:-
“She loves her husband dearly,
And another man quite as well."
But, commonly, it is not so. Her husband is a brute to whom she is
legally bound. The wife is, in fact, a victim tied to the horns of the
altar; and her agonies at her hard condition pierce any number of
waistcoats, cut their way through any corset, and go direct to the
human heart, as beating over a French novel—palpitating in a French
º lm fact, it is a household axiom—very successfully circu-
ated by M.BALZAc—that a woman has only to vow to love a man, to
be justified in hating him. The marriage service, like witches' prayers,
is to be read backwards. A woman in the bonds of French matrimony
is exposed to a monster like poor ANDROMEDA. Bold and t, and
very much and very tenderly to be rewarded, is the young gentleman
who shall free her from the creature permitted to devour her. The
bridal-flowers of the French bride are not in reality orange-blossoms
but every one of them a love-lies-a-bleeding. M. BALzac and others
ve gone over the decalogue, and with their sharpest pen-knives have
scratched out the forbidding negative in a certain commandment.
The marriage license is a license to snap the marriage-tie. In very
many tales has M. BALzag preached this consoling truth, but in none
with greater eloquence, aided by finer example, than in, Lº Grande
Bretéche. This tale, with a little more blister-powder added to it, for
the French stage, did its due sentimental workin a French Playhouse,
and—in mat course, as things theatrical are at the present time-
the piece finds its way to the Princess's Theatre, for the delight and
instruction of the humdrum, matrimonial English, who do not com-
monly look upon their corner-cupboards as places where wives may
when Jones or BRow N comes unexpectedly home, hide the gay and
gallant Robinson, with whom Mrs. Jones or, BRówn danced in her
spinster days; and who has therefore been followed by Robinson the
broken-hearted, with oaths upon his lips and a ten-pound note in
his pocket, to extort consent, and smooth the way to an elopement. In
fact, to take the victim Mrs. Jones or Brown to his arms, and,
staunching the bleeding heart, to make the loved one his own for ever
and for ever! - - -
The Married Unmarried is the English title to the last morality from
the sparrow-quill of M. BALzAc; whose ink-horn was a goat's-horn.
Adèle is married to a Colonel of wrought-iron: he is as hard as his
sword; as cold; but by no means as . or pointed. In a word,
the Colonel, being Adèle's husband, is a brute. Talk of the bonds of
matrimony, why the Colonel is a conjugal turnkey, and his poor wife
doomed to the condemned cell of her bed-chamber. Poor heart! He
—the brute-talks bullets; whilst she-especially when she speaks of
Juan-speaks pearls and diamonds. How should it be otherwise?
The Colonel is a Wampire, and Juan is a duck!
Well, the Colonel is called from home to Paris; and Juan, of
enters the Colonel's wife's bed-room to talk over the horrors of º
life, as suffered by Adele, and the joys that must certainly follow, if
Adèle would b her marriage-vow. And the lady is very much
inclined to do it. After all, what is it more than an ugly, Hymen in
china; already flawed by her wishes? Why, then, should it not be
entirely smashed by her determination? She has all but made up her
mind to run from her husband when—the mal apropos wretch!-the
husband returns.
What is to be done? How foolish to ask the question. Of course
Juan is put away with her other precious moveables, in Adele's bed-
room closet. Enter the Colonel, who—(French matrimony has such a
nose!)-smells a rat. The Colonel is such a brute, and does so bull
that sweet little wife—her face running with tears, a lily º
with morning dew—that after swearing to her innocence with the
energy of a trooper, she trusts in the support of Heaven and her
innocence, and boldly colifesses-there is a man in the closet!
Whereupon, blackthoughts of murder, thick as blackbeetles, crowd
into the cavernous, heart of the villain husband!. There is a certain
jocose mason, of the name of Colin, luckily on the premises. The
Colonel—in a demoniacal whisper—with the sternness of a Cato
desires themasontoblock up the door with Romancement. Bricks are
not enough for his revenge; but cement, that cement which the Colonel
knows is in the possession of Colin, and which in five minutes will be
harder than marble—hard as the Colonel’s heart.
The Colonel orders his supper in the bed-room; themason departs to
his work; and while Colin ſays it on with a trowel, the Colonel, with
no compunction, º his wine. No Laughty nun was ever walled
ºf mºre completely than—to the ferocious delight of the Colonel—is
zazz -
And now all is done, and the Colonel is exulting, when a troop of
gºndarmes enter with a warrant of bigamy against the doublehusbandi
*Hm! haſ glad it’s no worse.”
“But it is worse”—cries the virtuous Adèle; “it’s premeditated
murder 1’’
Only premeditated, gentle reader; because—of course—Juan escapes
through lath and plaster, confronting the Colonel; who is about to
finish him with his felonious sword, when he is turned from his se
by the very pointed bayonets of the force entrusted with the bigamy
warrant.
The infamous Colonel is conveyed to Paris to be tried for his offence,
and, as we hope, to be sent to the galleys; whilst Adèle, who has
already fallen into the arms of Juan, marries him, has a large family, .
and lives happily ever afterwards. -
No. We transgress the French canon. To live happily, she must
do everything except marry him. As Mrs. Peachem says, “’tis mar-
iage, husband, makes the blot.”
ow at an English theatre, is not this a pretty dish to set before an
English Queen?
TO THE NEUTRALS.
How many serfs has Nicholas to tremble at his mod?
How many slaves to fear him, and adore the “Russians' God?”
Germans! at least may you disdain to swell the wretched horde,
Under the scourge to grovel, and to crouch beneath the sword.
Speak, gallant Prussians! to the knout will you submit the back *
And Austrians! º if ye would see your Fatherland Cossack?
Will you consent that darkness shall again hide Europe's day,
Now is your time to answer, if you mean to answer Nay!
A Bed of “Cold Pisen.”
MR. SIMON, in his admirable Sanitary Report, calls the Thames “a
igantic Poison-bed.” Now, if it is so, it is entirely the fault of the City
orporation, who are the Conservators of the River. We, think,
therefore, that it is but right that, “as the Aldermen have made their
poison bed, so they should be made to lie in it.” -
TARE CARE or NUMBER one.
FIRST THoughts ARE THE BEST decidedly, inasmuch as it is not
every one whose powers of thinking will go so far even as that.

THE IRISH GRIEWANCE COMMITTEE.
THE following is the slightly anticipated Report which the Irish
Grievance Committee have, we believe, agreed upon making to the
House of Commons.
“The Committee was appointed on the complaint of various Irish
Members, who felt themselves greatly, outraged at being informed by
the Times newspaper that in England they were considered as a pack of
nº venal adventurers.
“The Committee thought, that the fairest way of
- - Fº at the
truth, was by hearing what the Irishmen had to say o
one another.
The Committee had proposed that the too flattering colours in which they ||
expected “Irishmen painted by themselves,” would be shown, should
subsequently be toned down to Saxon taste; but the process was
unnecessary.
“The Committee called a variety of witnesses before it, of all shades
of Irish politics, Qrange, Green, and Neutral, and beg to submit to
your Honourable House specimens of what they had to say.
“The RIGHT. HoN. Joseph NAPIER, late Attorney-General for
Ireland, stated that the whole management of the patronage of Ireland
had, so long as he recollected it, impressed the popular mind with the
belief that it was given for pecuniary purposes. He thought there was
a great deal of truth in these matters. He did not know of any man in
Ireland getting on by mere merit.”
“MR. KEogh, the present Solicitor-General for Ireland, took in
hand MR.LUGAs, one of the loudest players in the Pope's brass band,
and questioned him as, follows:– Did I not at a large public
meeting at Athlone describe you, in your presence, as one who would
É. dagger in a man's back, but never dare to do anything to
s prejudice openly in his presence.” To which MR. Lucas replied,
“You . me with being a calumniator, using the strongest lan.
guage which could proceed from human lips. But then we agreed that
everything in the report that had an angry character should be struck out.’
“DR. GRAY, an Irish writer of eminence, asked MR. Keogh whether
he had not described certain Irish gentlemen as PADDY SoMERs, and
fellows like those, who live by selling places.” MR. KEQGH would not
#: but did not exactly remember. But, naturally desirous to do
his best for his countrymen (and his evidence in exculpation of them
must be received with caution), he adds, that he never charged Irish
Members, on any public occasion, with selling places, but might have
*f; them with selling their country.
“MR.AIKINs, the Dublin Sword-bearer, stated that Members of the
Dublin §§. obtained compensation for lost places through
MR. John REYNoLDs, then, M.P. for Dublin. They collected £200 or
£300 to reward him in reply to the question, “And did MR. REYNoLDs
take the money?' the witness replied, ‘Indeed, Sir, he did, but in
order to avoid appearance of paying him for Parliamentary services,
theyNº. it down “Defence Fund.”
“MR. Lucas, above mentioned, desirous to retort upon MR. KEogh
for the unflattering ... drawn of him, charged MR. Keogh with
dishonourable conduct and corruption, but explained away this charge.
‘He meant making promises and taking oaths which were deliberately
broken. To MR. Keogh's question, he replied, in final explanation,
*In taking place you acted corruptly, and have done so ever since.”
“DR. GRAY, above mentioned, stated that in 1851, on a motion of
MR. DISRAELI's, MR. JoHN SADLIER, late an Irish ford of the
Treasury, came to him accompanied by MR. FRANCIS Scully, and said,
‘Here’s Scully won't vote for us after all, giving as a reason that he
has got an appointment from his brother. e had an arbitration in a
small angle of the lobby, and decided that MR. Scully might vote
according to his conscience.' .
“Your Committee, in further illustration of the subject, observe that,
on Friday, the 17th of March, the said M.R., SADLIER gave in the House
itself his opinion of MR.LUGAs, whom he described as a man who lived
by slandering and uttering libels, and that the sº accustomed
to Hibernian criticisms, supposed of course that MR. SADLIER's last
word was ‘lies, and called him to order. -
*On the whole your Committee decidedly think that the Irish
Members had better have let the subject alone, and not have adduced
formal proof of what was before only a general impression.”
THE HORRORS OF MR. CHAMBERS'S INQUISITION.
ALTHOUGH slightly objecting to the domination of Popish parsons,
Mr. Punch will ever i. among the first to exclaim against any injustice
done, or affront offered, to his Roman Catholic fellow-countrymen at
arge. Now they have of late been greatly wronged and insulted by
the language held in reference to them by those who profess to be
their friends; but who are, in fact, merely the tools of their priesthood.
Indeed, they may well say, “save us from our friends,” particularly
from their #. s in the House of Commons, from MR. Bowy ER to
MR. Osbor NE, inclusive.
The menaces with which MR. T. CHAMBERs's proposal for a Com-
mittee of Inquiry respecting Conventual and Monastic Institutions
was met by the Members for Rome, imply an accusation, surely most
unfounded, against their co-religionists. #. PoPE's representatives,
one after the other, insisted on the danger and impolicy of mootin
the proposed investigation at this juncture. This is as much as to te
the #. of Commons that it better not say, anything about
monasteries or convents just now—otherwise the ãº Catholics
will betray their country and their QUEEN to the EMPEROR OF RUSSIA.
Of course, there is no fear, that HER MAJESTY's Roman Catholic
subjects will take the prediction as a hint. Yet many of them will be
as strongly tempted to do so as it is possible that they can be by
e highly inflammatory and quite inaccurate. Depending on the
truthfulness of the delegates of his Holiness, when they find those
gentlemen denouncing the proposition of MR. CHAMBERs as an insult
an infraction of religious toleration, as persecution, as involving bru
treatment of unprotected females, &c., they may very, naturally con:
clude that the inquiry in regard to monasteries and convents will
consist of revolting interrogatories, answers to which will be extorted
by the rack and the thumbscrew. The Papal deputies speak as if the
seriously believed that such are the means by which the inquiry wi
be conducted. And yet they complain of it as being the reverse of
a Holy Inquisition.
The like extravagant language occurs, in a Declaration, whereunto
is appended a string of names so tremendously aristocratic, that nearly
every one of them might furnish a noble authoress with a title for a
fashionable novel. These Popish individuals of the superior classes
affect, moreover, to regard the question of the treatment of nuns as
exclusively their own affair. ow, it may be all very well for DE
Buggins and FITzwALKER, the Papists, to be quite easy with respect to
female relatives in a convent. ºut the case is otherwise with Pro.
testant Hopps and MUGGINs, whose sisters, or aunts, or grandmothers
º may have embraced popery and taken the veil. H. and
... would not feeſ quite satisfied on the subject of “ lº. and
as to the influence of “superiors” touching the disposal 9 *.
Into these matters they would be anxious to . all polite-
ness of course. But the House of Commons is told to inquire if it dares
—and if it does dare, to look out for treason 1 -
As MR. CHAMBERs proposes that his Committee shall consist partly
of Roman Catholics, it is probable that instruments of torture will not
be employed to elicit information, at least with unreasonable severity;.
and it is equally likely that no very grossly insulting line of examina-
tion will be adopted. Indeed, it may be pretty safely trusted, that
the question ordinary will be alone used, and no recourse whatever had
to the question extraordinary or impertinent.
To question their creed or institutions in anyway, however, seems to
be a }. offence to Roman Catholic zealots. As they denounce
such questioning so angrily as persecution, it may be doubted whether
they may not perhaps have used the latter term in history as freely as
they employ it in political discussion. One might suspect that, their
confessors were simply witnesses forced to confess the truth, and that
the block to which their martyrs were brought was a mere nonplus.
Perhaps the sufferers for their Romish opinions under ELIZABETH were
only interrogated: and FATHER GARNET, subsequently answered for
his conduct with his-tongue.

WAR 1
THRICE * years have passed away since England sheathed the
sword,
And battle-scarred, war-wasted, gave God thanks for peace restored,
With leisure for life's quiet tasks, and toils, and aims, and arts,
In the hum of the world's workshops, and the press of the world's
marts.
DAGON the Great had fallen! That God of sabre sway,
Whose sword carved realms, whose mod made kings or marred, had
passed away
And England, who had grappled with the giant, and had won,
Now saw a nobler strife to wage—deeds harder to be done.
Sins long condoned to be atomed; corruptions foul and old
To § out of her bosom; scum of lies and rust of gold;
Chaine º to free from bonds; new worlds to mould and man;
Conscience in Church and State to free from burthen and from ban.
Stoutly she set her to the task, and from that hour till now
Hath never once looked backwards, nor lifted hand from plough;
And, one by one, hath trophied conquests mightier by far,
n any ever chronicled on the iron roll of war.
Soldiers of Peace—what wonder thought of other strife we had
none
The captains we of Industry ! ... What recked we of pike or gun?
In spades and ploughshares, ships, and looms, our iron found employ;
Armies were royal playthings—the sword a silly toy.
When, lo, our peaceful dream is broke! And, startled from our toil,
We hear again the measured tramp of soldiers shake the soil;
º: ring to the hammering of guns and swords once more;
Again the º booms through our streets, and the broadsides shake
Our Shore.
The great war-devil we thought bound for aye hath snapped his chain,
And ramps and rends to the furthest ends of north and south again.
#. must leave her workshop, her innocent tools lay by,
And buckle on her armour, as of old, to do or die!
Not unto us, not unto us, the guilt, the sin, the shame!
be our witness, not of us the provocation came.
Much we have borne-all had forsworn but honour—still to bar
From us and from the nations the awful Fiend of War.
It may not be... The Fiend is free. And now our work is clear,
As in the old time we faced him, we must face him now and here.
Not mockingly—not mirthfully—but gravely as men ought
Who count their cost by the value of the thing that’s to be bought.
Our fathers met and mastered the Giant of the sword;
Had we been minded to be ruled he was indeed a Lord! ...
What was ATTILA's flail of iron to the knout wherewith this Czar,
A Slave himself, drives on his Slaves from icy steppes afar !
Body and soul he must control who rules as this man rules.

And look the great sun in the face that lights our own free sky,

FOUL PLAY IN THE CHURCH.
The following advertisement throws a new light on the means by
which a poor country parson may sometimes manage to make a liveli-
hood out of what is fancifully termed a living :-
COUNTRY CURATE is ready to supply AMATEURS ONLY with
Seats of Cochin Eggs, guaranteeing them sound, and no tricks ºlayed. Buff-birds,
10s. 6d.; Splendid First-class White Cochin, 2 guineas. Application to be made to
the National Schoolmaster, &c. &c.
The reverend advertiser appears to divide his attention between the
ultry yard and the .*. cure of souls and the care of chickens.
is object seems to be to get a shilling into his pocket º if he
cannot effect the object in a more legitimate manner. The reverend
poulterer, we regret, to see, feels it necessary, notwithstanding the
sacredness of his calling, to guarantee that there will be “no tricks
played,” as if he thought he might otherwise be suspected of a species
of thimble-rig with his eggs, and the substitution, perhaps, of an addled
Dorking for a first-class Cochin. - -
We have heard some revolting stories of the tricks of barristers, and
the frauds some of them will commit to get a fee allowed by a not very
curiously-inquiring judge; but the country curates, with all their
poverty, were, we thought, above being suspected of the swindling
that some who have found their way to the profession of the law
have been guilty of. The barrister's gown does, sometimes, shelter a
mass of dirt and dishonesty, but the surplice though often concealing a
ragged coat, does not often, we hope, encase the form of a plunderer.
The country curate who seeks an addition to his income by dealing in
Cochin eggs, need not, we think, have thrown a slur on his sacred
office by suggesting the probability of tricks being played by a parson-
poulterer on his customers.
The whole thing is lamentable enough, and we cannot help expressing
our regret that with the splendid revenues of the Church, it is necessary
for a country curate to be thinking of Cochin fowls, instead of
devoting himself to the more congeni É." of Co(a)chin students.
We beg to recommend the case to that highly respectable society the
Friend of the Clergy, which will soon be in the height of its annual
ining, preaching, and speechifying. If it could lay the great egg-case
before the public, and draw up a graphic account of the poor curate
who counted his chickens before they were hatched, the effect on the
after-dinner subscription-list would, in all probability, be excellent.
PUNCH BEFORE PARLIAMENT.

`S. new fashion of certain
Committees of the
House of Commons to
call before them the
newspapers for the pur-
pose of inquisition into

Mr. Punch. I believe
you, my boy!
Chairman. The Com-
mittee would like to
know what ſºil. there was for the large cut in last week's number?
Mr. Punch. There were two distinct grounds.
Chairman. Be good enough to name them.
Mr. Punch. A fore-ground and a back-ground.
Inquisitive M.P. Your publication is understood to be carried on at
a considerable expense. I should like to know at whose expense the
jokes are made.
Mr. Punch. At the expense of yourself, occasionally, or of anyone
else who may be the object of them.
Impertinent M.P. I find that certain Members who have taken a
certain course, are described by Punch as dishonest. Now I have
taken that course; am I therefore to understand that Punch charges
me with dishonesty
Mr. Punch. You speak of facts, and ask me to draw an inference.
The facts must speak for themselves, and 1 leave you and the public
to draw the inference.
Curious M.P. If you will not tell us the circulation of Punch,
perhaps you will tell us the greatest extent to which it has ever sold.
Mr. Punch. The greatest extent to which it might ever have been sold,
would have been in the event of its having put any faith in the DERBY-
DISRAELI, Ministry; but as Punch never, did put any faith in that
ministry, the extent to which Punch might be sold is incalculable.

INDISPOSITIONS MADE WERY EASY.
We read, in the Musical Transcript, that at one of the performances
of the Etoile du Nord, at the Opéra Comique,
“HERMANN LEoN was so indisposed as to crave the indulgence of the audience he,
however, played the part, and NATHAN sang the principal morpeaux.”
Now we think the above plan might be imitated with great benefit
at our London Theatres. For instance, suppose—and it will require
no great amount of imagination to suppose such a thing—MR. SIMs
Reeves is indisposed some ºn; An apology, is made for him,
(and it wouldn't i. the first time)—however, he will kindly speak the
words, and some one of equal, if not superior, merit will sing the prin-
cipal morceaua. MR. SIMs REEves's powers of indisposition, great as
his talent is undoubtedly in that respect, could not possibly extend so
far as to prevent him speaking the words of an opera; and the fact of
his appearance, independent of the pleasure the public would derive
from seeing their popular favourite, would convince them that he really
was ill; and would, moreover, have the effect of removing several
unpleasant doubts that have hitherto existed in their minds on that
imaginary musical score.
A Church Canon.
A cANON of Ely has just gone off, aged 59. For five-and-thirty
years the said canon was charged with pluralities to the amount of
£3,000 a-year; proving that you cannot have a worse report of a
Church Canon than by overloading the same with golden shot. Such
Church Canons were never known to the Army of Martyrs.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY.
N the departure of SIR CHARLEs
NAPIER for the Baltic, it was
observed, when HER Majesty
took leave of the fleet, that
one of the men on board the
Duke of Wellington had fear-
lessly climbed to the truck of
the main topmast, and there
joined lustily in the parting
cheer. The position was no
doubt chosen to show the
height of his loyalty, and we
certainly may question if any
but a tar could have screwed
his enthusiasm to so high a
pitch. But, however daring
the feat may have seemed, it
has since been utterly eclipsed
by the exploit of a brother
sailor. For, on the sailing of
the squadron under ADMIRAL
CoRRY, we are reliably informed by “our own correspondent” that—
NAVAL
“The same daring and exuberant enthusiasm which manifested itself on Saturday
on board the Duke, was displayed on this occasion; and on the giddy top of the main,
fore, and mizen trucks, was perched a tar, who holding one hand aloft, and with the
other wildly waving his hat, testified alike his daring and his loyalty.”
This picture of “a tar” perched on three mastheads at once some-
what forcibly reminds us of the old play-bill announcement of a
favourite ormer appearing in three pieces. However, exuberant a
man's enthusiasm may be, we yet can scarcely conceive of its enabling
him to sit simultaneously in three distinct places. Indeed, with all our
knowledge of conjuring, we must confess we feel a little puzzled to
know how the feat was accomplished, and we should be glad if “our
own,” in a future number of his journal, would condescend to en-
lighten us.
In these days of Mont-Blancism we are of course prepared for almost
any amount of climbing, but this synchronous ascent to three separate
mast-heads has, we must admit, completely astonished us. , Considered
merely as a feat of strength we can't help thinking that it’s coming it
a little too strong. We have no wish, however, to accuse “our own "
of any intentional deviation from veracity; and we therefore think we
shall be putting the most charitable construction on the matter, if we
assume that his account was written after dinner; and that when
describing his “tar” at so impossible an elevation, the writer possibly
himself may have been a little elevated.
AN ATTORNEY IN THE COURT OF HYMEN.
THERE are more Philosophers, in the world than people generally
suppose. An Advertisement which has, appeared in the Hampshire
Independent demonstrates this; in the following very few words:-
ATRIMONIAL ALLIANCE OFFICE &c. &c. Legally Established
in 1848. For introducing Ladies and gentlemen, at present unknown to each
other who are desirous of entering into matrimony. Upwards of 7,000, comprising
all classes of society, have been married and made happy through M.R. Liston's
assistance during the last four years.
Whether MR. LISTON means 7,000 persons or 7,000 couples, doth
not appear; but if through his means 3,500 men, and, as many women,
have been “married and made happy” during the last four years—
then certainly does this world, at least HER MAJESTY's part of it,
contain a very considerable proportion of º Not that
marriage, and happiness in consequence, can be said to argue philo-
sophy, though happiness in spite of marriage may. , But here we have
between three and four thousand couples, at the lowest computation,
marrying philosophically. In the first place they marry upon an ab-
stract principle; the simple desire to be married: apart from any pre-
dilection or passion for the concrete called Loved One, Young Man,
Young Woman, or Sweetheart; In the next place they are “made
happy” by the gratification of that very moderate desire, Now, to find
happiness in the satisfaction of moderate desires is the essence of
ph osophy. To the attainment of this felicity, however, it seems that
* MR. #oº assistance”—in the shape, probably, of wise exhor-
tation—is necessary; for, proceeds his advertisement,
“And such unparalleled success is the best guarantee that all can be suitably
married, irrespective of Age, Appearance, or Position.”
There is no degree of º ugliness, or poverty, to which
a match could not be found. The difficulty is to persuade iotard to
accept Crone, Guy to take Griffin, Beggar to put up with Tramp, and
vice versá. To reconcile a stout middle-aged gentleman to union with
a lady of corresponding years and dimensions may often be no easy
task; and may require a great, deal of “assistance” on the part of
MR, LISTON; consisting probably of a discourse on the unimportance
of Form. For a decided turn for moralizing is evinced in his an-
nouncement, which thus continues:-
“Ladies and gentlemen who are anxious to Marry, but who cannot find suitable
Partners amongst their own circle of acquaintances, should apply immediately, and
not wait in the too often fallacious hope of being more successful next year, &c. &c.,
and thus waste the most valuable time of life seeking an object that can be attained in
a month.'
In addition to the above valuable advice, MR. LISTON says:–
“Read the Matrimonial Guide; it contains full
articulars for application, and will
convince everybody.
Sent gratis to any address for six stamps to pay the postage.”
Of what the Matrimonial Guide will convince everybody, MR.Liston
does not mention. His own “integrity” he offers to #. by refe-
rences to “his Bankers and others of respectability.” He states that
“ as he employs no Agents, the strictest secresy may be relied on,”
and concludes with this impressive warning:—
“Beware of those who keep Agents, or advertise imaginary referees and
testimonials.”
To the country gentleman who wants to marry somebody without
being attached to anybody, as an appropriate form of application for
the aid of this matrimonial attorney, may be suggested a few senti-
mental but simple
LINES TO MR. LISTON.
An aching void within my heart
There is, which be it thine to fill;
I cannot play the lover's part
fleave it to thy better skiii.
My bosom yearns for one sweet mate,
My sorrows and my joys to share,
For whom P Nay, that I cannot state,
I know not—and I do not care
Seek then for me the being dear
Who shall my life with rapture crown,
And either send the charmer here,
Or let our hands be joined in town.
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.
With the bombastic appeals of NICHOLAs to the fanaticism of his
slaves, may be contrasted the following language addressed by QUEEN
Victor LA to her subjects:—
“HER MAJESTY is persuaded that in so acting, she will have the cordial support of
her people; and that the pretext of zeal for the Christian religion will be used in vain
to cover an aggression undertaken in disregard of its holy precepts, and of its pure and
beneficent spirit.
“HER MAJESTY humbly trusts that her efforts may be successful, and that by the
blessing of Providence peace may be re-established on safe and solid foundations.”
These simple and solemn words will touch the feelings to which they
are spoken with a power far greater than the effect of the Czar's melo-
dramatic and blasphemous invocations. They have one peculiar force;
the force of truth: wherein they have the advantage, not only over
NICHOLAS’s professions of zeal for Christianity, but also over almost
every syllable that he utters.
The gentle and humble declaration of the QUEEN will probably be
read by the Emperor with a horse-laugh, which we hope will be soon
changed into a howl. -
FALSE HAIRS AND GRACES.
AN indignant father of a family has sent us a circular, which he
snatched from the hands of his eldest daughter, and in which young
ladies are invited by some atrocious dealer in wigs, to adopt his
filthy manufacture, by mixing with their own locks the hair cut from
the heads of other people—frequently on account of fever, and some-
times under circumstances of a still less attractive nature. We share
with our Correspondent the disgust he feels at these mercenaries, who,
for the sake of selling a few sham curls and fictitious tresses, put false.
hood literally into the heads of the rising generation—and, oh horror!
the female part of it. We are not advocates for violence, and we are
rather disposed to agree with the Dramatist, that “the man who lays
his hand,” &c. &c., “is an,” &c., “whom it, would be gross flattery
to call an,’ &c. &c. We, nevertheless, are disposed to think, that if
a young lady is. suspected of wearing false hair it would be allowable
to dash her wig to the ground, and though we are not inclined to
recommend the tearing of the hair, we would excuse any one who
should unmask a female impostor by carrying away the “false front”
under which she may have ventured to present herself.

A KIND WORD FOR THE CZAR.
oxie flowers, as we all
know, were strewn on
the grave of NERO–it
is supposed by some
solitary friend, inwhose
affections even that ty-
rant held a place. More
probably the act was
performed by some
small boy in a †: of
opposition. o this
motive, only can be
ascribed the sympathy
with the EMPERQR, of
Russia, exhibited in a
recent debate, by the
MARQUIs of GRANBY.
According to the Morn-
ing Chronicle—
“The MARQUIs of GRANby
said it was a matter of re-
gret to him to observe the
tone and language that had
been used by Members of
the Government and others,
who were no doubt consci-
entiously opposed to the ag-
gression of Russia. That
aggression might be wrong,
as well as dangerous to the
interests of this country;
but it would be more becom-
ing this great nation if it
entered into the argument
of the facts more in the
spirit of the Honourable Member for Manchester than some of the speakers that night.”
It is difficult to say whether it is more extraordinary that the MARQUIs of
GRANBy should feel for the injured name of Nicholas, or that he should coincide
in any sentiment with MR. BRIGHT.
“He objected to the tone of these speeches, a tone which the Emperor on his part did not employ.
The Emperor gave us full credit for our desire to maintain the peace of the world, a credit which we,
on the other hand, denied to him. (Laughter."
We have given the Czar a great deal too much, credit for a desire to maintain
the peace of the world. For that desire he has had twelve months' credit, which
is twelve months too much. We gave him more credit, we are sure, than the MAR-
QUIs of GRANBy would expect from his tailor.
“He knew that there were gentlemen who believed that, do what the Emperor would, or say
what he might, there was an underhand meaning very different from that which appeared; and he
said that if they entered on the discussion of these blue books and correspondences in that spirit they
could not arrive at the truth."
Few gentlemen doubt the meaning of what the EMPERoR of Russia does. There
was no equivocation in the Sinope massacre. But one signification can be attached
to his assertions when delivered from the cannon's mouth. The doubt is as to the
sense of what proceeds from his own. For instance, when he calls himself a gen-
tleman, it is clear that he means something else; and a correct though vulgar
answer to his pretence to be such, would consist in telling him that he is another.
“He thought the Honourable Member who had stigmatised Russia as having acted fraudulently
would regret having used such an expression of that power.”
Why, any more than having applied the same expression to the conduct of any
“gentleman” that has been sent to the House of Correction during the past week?
One should rather rejoice in having employed so temperate, yet just, an expression
when one's indignation might have hurried one into the use of coarse substantives
and adjectives, and even participles of a low and profane description.
“Then came the Vienna note, which the Emperor, who was called ‘the disturber of the public
peace,’ was willing to accept. What Russia wished for was the Protectorate of the Greek
Church. Was there in that demand anything that we should really be afraid of? Was there
anything in that demand that showed she wished to take Constantinople?”
Of course there was not anything in the demand that showed any such wish.
Good care was taken that there should be nothing of the sort. Really such a
question is unworthy of the name of the noble MARQUIs. So sºmnle an inter-
rogatory may be regarded as the sign of the Green Man ra.c. v.au vual of the
MARQUIs of GRANby.
When, for merely destroying a single life by violence, an individual is called a
number of names, of which the mildest is assassin, the question which Lord
GRANBy may be invited to consider is, whether to describe the Czar as “the
disturber of the public peace,” is not to speak of him with a gentleness so extreme
as to be absurd.

FEMALE EMPLOYMENT.
“SIR,
“In these days of starving economy, when
governesses and needlewomen are so shamefully underpaid,
may I take the liberty of suggesting a new opening for
female employment, which I think would be attended with
the most beneficial and lucrative results. It is well known
the many annoyances that, bachelors are almost daily ex-
posed to in connection with their linen. Legal students,
perhaps, suffer the most in these trying emergencies, as there
never is any one—not even a laundress—on the premises,
to whom they can. º for assistance. Now my sugges-
tion is this:—I think that if a number of women were to
go through the Inns of Court every morning with the
charitable object of sewing, stitching, and mending all
imperfect garments, they would realise a very large income.
Their visits should take place between nine and ten
o'clock in the morning before the day's studies began,
and they might give notice of their approach by crying
out, “Any buttons want sewing?—any shirts to mend?”
am confident the returns would be very large, and that the
new business would be an immense boon to all distressed
always full, the other generally empty. Musicians, when they wish to distinguish §:#d ºº: :*...* of the whole day
the former from its young rival, make a musical point of calling it the “Don't Philhar- “Y Sir, in all .
monic.” The allusion to the emptiness of the old institution is understood at ours, Sir, in all seriousness,

If these Lights are supplied with Russian
tallow, the sooner they take in a good supply
of it, we think, the better, unless º have a
particular desire to shine as one of the lights

hearing of the “barbarian darkness of, the
North,” and yet, in º of all its tallow, there
is no nation in such a state of darkness as
Russia
A ROMANCE OF ROME.
THE literary organs of ultra-Protestantism are generally spoken of as
serious journals ; but those of the opposite party appear more deserving
of the appellation...Qur ultramontane contemporary, the Tablet, reviews
a biography, one of the series of Oratorian Lives, called “The Life of
SAINT FRANCIs of Assisi,” which for seriousness in the narration of
the most astonishing events, may not *} be said to surpass the once
famous Methodist Magazine, but also the honderful ditto; and at least
to equal the personal memoirs of MR. LEMUEL, GULLIVER, Having,
without abatement of his own ſº mentioned an occasional inter-
ruption of that of the Saint, who, he says, used to be raised “into the
air during his contemplations, so high sometimes that he was even out
ºf sight,” at, which times we suppose he was seen by multitudes of
The faithful,” the Reviewer quotes the following as an authentic
fact:—
“A MIRACLE of St. FRANC14.—The earliest authors of the life of our Saint record
a very singular miracle which he performed on his route in the house of a gentleman.
All the inhabitants of the place were gone to the great square to hear him preach. A
female servant who had been left in a house to take care of a child, wishing to hear the
sermon, left the child alone. On her return she found the child dead, and half boiled
in a copper of hot water, into which it had fallen. She took it out, and, in order to
hide the disaster from the father and mother, she shut it up in a trunk; the parents,
however, learnt their misfortune, which was the more afflicting as this was their only
child. The husband entreated his wife not to let her distress appear, out of respect
for the servant of God, who was to dine with them. During dinner FRANCIs endea-
voured to inspire them with a holy joy, knowing what the Almighty had in store for
their consolation, and at the end of dinner he feigned to wish to eat some apples.
They expressed their regret that they had none to offer him; but pointing to the trunk
in which the child was shut up, he said: ‘Let them look there and some will be found.”
It was in vain that they assured him that there was none there ! he insisted on having
the trunk opened. The gentleman, to oblige him, and with a view of hiding the object
of their grief, opened the trunk, when, judge of his astonishment, on finding his child
alive and well, and with a smiling countenance, holding an apple in each hand.
Transported with joy he carried the child and placed it in the arms of the holy man.
(Pages 36, 37).”
Certainly this would be “a very singular miracle,” if it were true.
Its moral meaning is particularly singular. In the natural course of
things, children, are apt to tumble into the fire, or into coppers, and
generally, to gº into scrapes, and hot water by reason of being im-
properly left by their nursemaids. Whether the cause of the abandon-
ment be the policeman round the corner, or a popular preacher in the
adjoining square, the practice of such dereliction is very undesirable;
and the story of a miracle wrought to º: its consequences does not
appear to be a very edifying, anecdote. ... How the parents showed their
respect for the Saint by hiding their distress from him, is not clear;
and indeed the distress which could be concealed so easily, seems con-
siderably less than natural on such an occasion. The pretence of the
holy man that he wanted apples, and the appearance of the infant with
ºne in each hand, certainly reminds us of some wonderful performances
t we have witnessed—on the part of Clown and Pantaloon. The
species of the apples is not mentioned by the hagiologist; he might as
well have id: that they were “monstrous pippins.” Berhaps Some
of the pips are still to be seen at the Brompton Oratory.
QUOD NUNC DESCRIBERE LONGUM EST.
MR, PUNCH's contemporaries, who are always on the watch for some
animal, mineral, or, vegetable wonder, have § discovered, in Cali-
fornia, a tree, which grows to the height of 360 feet, and measures 90
feet in circumference. And they affirm that when one of these trees
had fallen through decay, a horseman rode into the hollow trunk for
upwards of a hundred feet, and then found space to turn his horse
round and ride out again. Now Mr. Punch has no objection to the
roduction of this tree-mendous article in print. He will tolerate it as
e tolerated the “colossal cucumber” and “early gooseberry” of
blessed memory. He admits that the gentlemen of the press must
live, and as, if my LoRD DERBY ºf ever succeed in preventing
them from publishing the truth, they will be compelled to rely upon
their power of invention for the means of subsistence, Mr. Punch
would not have them allow that useful faculty to f'. rusty, Let

shade, even the, whole of those arborescent myths, the Nine Elms at
Vauxhall, but let, them not presume to . Mr. Punch's

he Morning Advertiser, after, describing the before-mentioned tree,
actually says, “This tree is said to be an evergreen pine; but, *
rom its great size, we should imagine it to be a plane (plain) tree.'
The Press thus comments on it: “We have read of the ‘Arabian trees
which wept gum, but remarkable as those trees were for their tears,
this is at least as remarkable for its size (sighs).” The Morning
Herald opines that the officer who rode into the tree was deterred from
proceeding farther by his fear that he should not be able to find the
route (root); and the Standard surpasses all the other offenders, by
suggesting that the horse may have been frightened by the tree's bark.
The Tide of Opposition.
THE strongest and foulest opponent the City of London has is one

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
FANCY PORTRAIT.-MR, STURGEON.
THE “WALKING” GENTLEMEN-AT-ARMS.
The necessity for sending our troops abroad has led to the consider-
ation of how we may economise our forces at home, and the subject
has produced the following short conversation—or legislative duet–
in the House of Commons:
“Mr. WARNER rose, in pursuance of notice, to ask the Secretary at War whother
the Government are willing to consider the expediency of entrusting the ordinary
escort duty of HER MAJESTY to the QUEEN’s Guard of the Honourable Corps of
Gentlemen-at-Arms instead of employing a cavalry regiment. At a moment when
they were sending troops abroad,it might be well to avail ourselves for this special
service of a corps in all respects thoroughly efficient for such a purpose, except that
they were not mounted. (The Honourable Gentleman throughout his question was
greeted with considerable laughter).
“Mr. S. HERBERT said–Sir, in consequence of the notice given by the Honourable
Gentleman, I made some inquiries into the subject, and obtained some information as
to the constitution of this corps. (Laughter). But as I find thereby that they have not
been in possession of horses for a period of 150 years (much laughter), I am afraid that
their disuse of mounts might incapacitate them for the duties they would be called on
to fulfil. (Great laughter).”
As it appears that the Gentlemen-at-Arms have not had a horse for
a century and a half, it is Pºli that there would be a frightful
falling off among the corps if any attempt were inade to turn it into a
body of cavalry. It would indeed be cruel to set any unfortunate
fellow on horseback for the first time in his life, to act as an escort to
the Sovereign; and indeed, unless the Gentlemen-at-Arms were to be
strapped on by the legs, it is doubtful whether they would not have to
yacate their seats in a rather undignified manner. Perhaps it might
be worth the consideration of the Government whether it would not be
a saving to the country to give “the honourable corps” half a dozen
lessons in riding at the º expense, to enable them to hold on for
the short time they might be required to do duty, instead of a cavalry
regiment, in attending on HER MAJESTY. Perhaps an arrangement
might be made to #: the honourable corps on velocipedes, which as
the road between Buckingham Palace and the Houses of farliament
is pretty smooth, would glide pleasantly enough over the ground, and
thus the “gentlemen riders” might keep pace with the royal carriage
without being called on for any effort in the way of horsemanship, of
which they appear to be incapable.
It is quite evident that the Gentlemen-at-Arms are not as yet fit to
trust to anything but their legs, and though, it is their duty to be in
attendance on the diplomatic circle, a few days' attendance on AstLEy's
circle would much improve their general efficiency. They may be
useful enough at a Drawing m or Levee as supernumeraries in a
sort of theatrical display, but at present their utility must be confined
to that of “walking gentlemen.”
The Sawney Bean of the North.
SAwney BEAN-according to Scotch chronicles—was wont to live
and fatten himself upon babies. The SAwNEY Romanoff of Russia
is to be treated—according to certain politicians—after the like fashion.
ll our innocent, ones—our little chicks—such as the infant Reform
Bill, the baby Ballot, and the toddling Public Lib Bill—are to have
their tender necks wrung, and be straightway offered up to the maw of
Nicholas. The EMPEROR or Russia's º stops the way; and
like the carriage of JuggERNAUT, everything of living interest is to be
thrown under its wheels.
THE (GRATUITOUS) EXHIBITION OF THE ROYAL
ACADEMY.
Though the exhibition of the Royal Academy does not open
nominally till May, there was an exhibition on a much larger scale at
Trafalgar Square last week, than will be seen this year within the walls
of the National Gallery. We were present at the opening of the Exhi-
bition, which had much of the effect of a moving panorama, and the
pictures were extended in spring vans, displayed in cabs, carried in the
arms, or hanging on the painters’ hands, as many of them are likely to
do for some time, while an eager multitude thronged round, to catch
the best glimpse they could of productions which may not be destined
again to ; seen in public. We shall not criticise an exhibition of the
very indiscriminate nature we have described, nor shall we say anythin
to wound the affectionate pride with which the would be Titian hugge
to his arms the piece of high art which is destined at some future day
to take a very high place over his own chimney-piece. -
There were some touching, instances of pain shown by artists at
resigning to other custody their cherished productions, but as the
artists in question and their works are likely to meet again very soon–
certainly within a month—it would be a waste of sympathy and pathos
to grow sentimental on such a subject.
FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.
MRs. DE Poyntz HoNITON IACEY does not intend coming up t
town this year, but has already signified her intention of remaining at
her country villa at Herne Bay until the autumn, when she will transfer
her elegant establishment, as usual, to Margate. This resolution has
been the source of great regret and unceasing lamentation amongst
MRs. DE Poyntz LACEY's six unmarried daughters, and has caused
no little panic in the most distinguished circles of Pentonville, where
their beauty and accomplishments created, it may be recollected, so
great a sensation two years ago. Their absence is to be attributed to
the War, as their worthy and respected mother has been heard more
than once to give audible expression to her fears that the London
season this year, in onsequence of the absence of so many officers, who
are engaged on their duties in the East, will be a very dull one. This
is not the only maternal breast by many, we have good reason, for
stating, on which the same vague fear has operated with precisely a
similar effect.—Fashionable Paper.

The question being understood, the reply perhaps would be, rather
general {º The shape of a nasty little wretched sandwich that one
gets at MRs. AstERISK's evening parties.”
“5. Mention the two corollaries deduced from Prop. xxxii.”
A corollary would naturally be conceived of by not a few young
ladies as some sort of an ornament for the neck.
“7. Define a gnomon.” ^
The definition would be vague, most likely. “Something horrid”
would be the most perspicuous that could be reasonably expected.
Next comes “Algebra; ” a little whereof will go a considerable
way:-
1. If a = 1, = 3, c = 5, d = 0, find the values of ++
and a 2 + 2 b 2 + 3 c 2 + 4 d ?.
8 c b a 2 a + b
F- + -: c
2. Reduce to their simplest forms—

{2a –6 at-wº - {a’-(4 at 4 b }}+ {*-a'-a')}
‘8. Multiply 9 a “ — 3 ab + b 2 – 6 a – 2 b + 4 by 3 a + b + 2.”
The resemblance between the above formulæ, and those of Miss 4,
drop 1,” &c., would doubtless occasion a solution of the problems to
be attempted in crochet.
Then comes Botany, and then Geology, wherein the following in-
quiries are propounded, among others:–
“10. In the Palaeozoic era, what names are given to the principal groups of anim is,
and particularly to the fishes of the Devonian strata.
In the secondary series, what strata prevailed? Name them in succession.
In what strata are the fossil reptilia the most abundant? Specify some of th
saurians.
In reference to the chalk, distinguish the upper from the lower strata, and
describe two of its great beds in basins in England.
In what respect did the fishes of the chalk period differ from those of the
earlier strata?”
“11.
“12.
“13.
“14.
Chalk beds are not four-posters. Basins are earthenware, not chalk.
These, jº are the most satisfactory responses that would be
returned to the preceding interrogations.
Chemistry is the next article; and the gentle pupil is required to
say–
“18. To what cause may the expansion of bodies be ascribcd 7"
To eating and drinking more than is proper for them, the reply
might possibly be.
She is also to solve this riddle:—
“21. How can we have ice and boiling water in the same vessel ?”
“By shipping ice from Wenham Lake in a steamer,” she may
answer.
Then she is called on to
“26. Give a succinct account of the chemical action in burning a candle, mentioning
the effects and products of the combustion.”
Supposing the candle to be a composite, she might safely describe
the result as a decomposition; and might add, that if the candle were
burned at both ends, its combustion would be attended with a rapid
disappearance of tin.
Under the head of “Histoire de France,” she is requested to
declare—
“15. Quel Age avait Louis XV. a l'époque de son avénement, qui fut régent pendant
sa minorité, et à qui donna-t-il sa confiance?”
Rather a delicate question, the latter.
at large, she is asked—
“18. Who were the Seven Sages of Greece? Give some account of the poets."
A large order, as commercial gentlemen say, in regard to the poets.
One more question from Mythology—
“4. What account does history give of Cybele?”
Pretty much as reliable an account as it gives of CINDERELLA, might
be not very impertinently responded.
It must not be inferred from any of the above remarks that Mr.
Punch disapproves of the cultivation of the female mind to the utmost
extent of its powers. . The more a lady knows about the crust of the
earth the better, if she possesses a corresponding acquaintance with
the formation of pie-crust. And as to mathematics, let her be a
wrangler, as long as she keeps her temper in common argument.
In connection with History
THE SEWERS, ALIVE AND KICKING.
THE Sewers Commission which was wºrried to have committed
suicide a few weeks ago, seems to have scutched” instead of having
quite killed itself. The Home Office refuses to put the poor thing out
of its misery; and the Commission is, therefore, neither dead nor
alive; or, to use a more familiar phrase, it is in a “deadly lively.”
condition.
It is characteristic of the “ruling, passign strong in death,” that
the Commission, which has always done things by halves, has only
half killed itself. It is unfortunate that nobody will give the finishing
blow to a body that has such a knack of leaving things undone, that it
cannot even finish itself off in a business-like manner...We object to
suicide in any shape; but really we cannot help thinking that when
honourable gentlemen, have made up their minds to do away with
themselves, they should “do it, not leave the task” to the Home
Office, which has enough on its hands without being called in to put a
eriod to a parcel of unprofitable existences. The Commission of
ewers is at present in a dying state, in consequence of a self-inflicted
blow, which was not decisive enough to be immediately fatal, and the
result is, that we are bored with a death scene as long as that of a
provincial Richard the Third who, after having been regularly riddled
through the body in a dozen places, by Richmond's sword, has still a
supply of vital sparks sufficient to keep him hopping and fizzing about
the stage for ten minutes, like a nearly exhausted cracker. Can
nobody put the Commission out of its misery Qur own correspondent

RIVAL PAPER-MAKERS.
The EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA has petitioned the EMPEROR of Russia
that the Austrian Troops, if sent into the .. be not gºpelled
to take Russian paper-money. How wise and business-like this is! It is
on a par with the subterfuges and tricks that opposition tea-dealers resort
to in order to allure each other's custom. Austria knows well enough
that if the Russian paper gets into the market there will be but
little chance for their own. We wonder it did not petition at once that
the trºops should be paid in, nothing but Austrian, paper-money. It
could have made but little difference to the troops themselves, for the
value of the paper, no matter whether it came from Wienna or St.
Petersburg, would have been about the same. In the meantime, it
remains to be proved how these paper-soldiers will stand fire!

THE WAR AND THE WOMEN.
THERE is one of the “horrors of war ” that has hitherto escaped
public observation, but it is a horror which is beginning to excite
universal alarm amongst the unprotected females of England. It is all
very well for the troops to go away cheerfully, with their bands playing
“The Girls we leave behind us,” but some of the girls that are left
behind find it very difficult to reconcile themselves to such an easy
and off-hand mode of treatment. One girl of our acquaintance, who is
not likely to be left very long behind, writes on the war question as
follows:–
“It has a serious aspect as regards us young ladies. We read every day of a draught
of fine young men. Perhaps 50, perhaps 500, are sent off to the East. There won't b-
any one left worth having. There will really be no alternative for us but the Church
The clergy will have it all their own way."
There is something very pathetic in this lamentation over the per-
petual draught of “fine young men,” and the idea of throwing more
oung women into the arms of the clergy, who have already got their
ds full of the sex, is very far from satisfactory. . As it is, we have
nearly every parson besieged with slippers, worked by fair hands, and
inundated with tea-pots, purchased by the subscriptions of infatuated
females; but, when the clergyman is the only article left in the
matrimonial market, we may expect that not even the poorest curate
will be safe in his surplice from the too affectionate grasp of some of
the “girls” that the soldiers have “left behind them.”
Astonishing Kindness.
ThE Globe mentions a circumstance, respecting HowARD the philan-
thropist, which constitutes by far the strongest instance on record of
that illustrious man's benevolence. It is that he, at the age of 25,
married a first wife who was then 52. HowARD is generally admitted
to have been an individual who was in advance of his age: but few are
i. * the first MRs. HowARD's so greatly exceeded that of her
usband.
GUY FAWKESOFF'S GUNPOWDER PLOT IN THE BALTIC.
AMONG the foreign intelligence published by some of our contem-
poraries, is mentioned a plan for the destruction of the British fleet in
the Baltic, invented by an ingenious Russian gentleman, whom
Nicholas, if it answers, will handsomely reward. Large masses of
stone, or boulders, have been placed on the ice, in order that, when it
melts, they may sink, and become artificial rocks, whereon our gallant
vessels are to founder. In addition, these lumps of rock have been
charged with gunpowder, communicating, by means of wires, with a
galvanic arrangement in the nearest fortress, by means whereof, should
the ship escape foundering, it may be blown up.
Our contemporaries have not described the contrivance for insulatin
the wires, without which this clever device would prove abortive, an
which would have to resemble that of the submarine telegraph in
every particular, except in being prodigiously stronger, in order to stand
the rolling and bumping of the houlders.
From a peculiar source of information, we are enabled to state that
the shortest of the insulating cables is a hundred miles long, and is
rincipally composed, not of gutta percha, as was originally intended,
ut of India rubber, to allow for stretching. For the same reason the
wires are formed of gold, that metal being superior to copper in
ductility. These two circumstances are calculated to give soiâe idea
of the gigantic resources of the Russian empire.
It does not appear that the intelligence of this formidable arrange-
ment for the annihilation of the Baltic fleet has created any great
excitement amongst our tars; and we believe it has also been related
to the brave corps of Marines without in any way disturbing their
equanimity.
The Turf.
IN pure admiration of the ill-used NIGHoLAs, it is said that Lord
DERBY and the MARQUIs of GRANBY intend, in their own august
ersons, to run this year for the EMPEROR's Cup. If the Marquis should
appen to win, there are heavy odds against his winning by a head.

has been acquired in the cultivation of patients, would no more be

“WHAT A stuNNING MEERschAUM You've Got THERE, Charley
“Yes, I THINK It will BE HANDsoME BY THE TIME I’ve PRoPERLY Coloured IT."
THE JUDGES SENT TO COWENTRY..
TheRE is really something more in being “sent to Coventry”, than
the phrase generally implies, for we have the authority of CHIEF
Justice JEEvis and MR. Justick ColeRIDGE for . that the
horrors of Coventry are intolerable by any decent member of any
decent society. We cannot wonder that to send a man to Coventry is
to “cut” him; for it is—if we may believe the papers—to cut him off
from all the amenities of civilised life, and to doom him to a state of
dirt, damp and degradation. - -
We art, however, speaking on the authority of the judges of the
land, and we therefore proceed to quote some pas from the charge
delivered to the grand jury the other day by SIR. T. J. CoLeRIDGE at
Coventry. After speaking of the offences, his Lordship proceeded to
observe:
“The lodgings appointed for the Judges, he need scarcely say, º (and it was not
too much to ask) to be wholesome, clean, plain, and comfortable. e was quite sure
the Judges would require nothing more; but he was sorry to say that the lodgings
which had been prepared for him were quite prejudicial to health to remain in then—
to eat, to drink, or to sleep in them. If any of the Grand Jury would take the trouble
to visit the place they would bear him out in these remarks. The High Sheriff would
also bear his testimony that for a person to remain there was impossible; it was really
£. to a man's health to live in such a place. The stench which pervaded the
ed-room, the dining-room, and the other rooms of the house, was to such an extent
that it was extremely offensive and unwholesome, and the Chief Justice (who was in
a very delicate state), as well as himself, were obliged to sleep with their windows
open. He did not think it right to sleep in the town another night, and should
therefore go to Warwick.”
... We strongly sympathise with the excellent and learned judges, who
in consequence of the disgusting stench at their lodgings, were the
innocent cause of justice being brought into very bad odour. We
cannot understand i. from the words of the charge whether the
two 3. were packed in the same sleeping apartment, but as both their
Lordships were obliged to sleep with the window open, we may pre-
sume that they were condemned to a “Double Bedded Room,” which,
though an excellent subject for a “screaming farce,” is hardly a fit
scene for the introduction of two of the most elevated of judicial cha.
racters. . Neither of their Lordships is stupidly fastidious, but are
both of them men of strong sense, and if they jº a strong sense of
smell, there is no reason why that sense shoul #: outraged by a

INWASION OF HAMPSTEAD HEATH.
| WRITING under the signature of “ One of the
| Public,” a correspondent of the Times informs
ºlus that—
- “For the sixth time the persevering Lord of the Manor
| of Hampstead has applied to Parliament to alter his father's
||||} will, to enable him to build over his property at that place
| —a power which his father withheld from him.”
| l The perseverance with which the individual
alluded to returns, year after year, to the charge
||with his little bill, is worthy of an old English
bill-man. But as the bill is not brandished in
the face of the foe, but in that of the people
and is merely an instrument for cutting up and
enclosing Hampstead Heath, we trust, for the
good of the London public, that the said bill
will be once more dishonoured.

quite clear that the Bed of i. dignity is not always a bed of roses,
and indeed poor JERVIs, C.J. seems to have been provided with some-
thing worse even than the bed, of the Thames, for, we find from the
following extract that he literally slept in a cesspool :
“CHIEF Justick JEnvis sat in the Second Court, at St. Mary's Hall, and before
proceeding to business made some remarks on the Judges' lodgings, even more strongly
condemnatory than those made by Ms. Justice Colºnidas. A document being
handed to his Lordship in which it was alleged there had been some alteration of a
| figure, he said he could not perceive it; and took occasion to add, he was sorry to say
he had been lying in a cesspool all night; a place only fit for pigs, or people who had
been brought up in Coventry."
There have been judges in former times, and, indeed there are a few
still on the Bench, who could luxuriate in their pipe, and, vulgarly
speaking, enjoy “a drain,” but we doubt if there is, ºr ever was, a
wearer of the judicial ermine, who could appreciate such a pipe, pro-

THE LAW OF COMPENSATION.
EveRYBody allows that some “compensation” is due to
MR. StonoR, the newly appointed and dis-appointed Colo
nial Judge, who, after having sent in his testimonials,
including the report ºf an election committee, imputing to
him the offence of “bribery”, was, notwithstanding the
imputation, which he had himself brought under the notice
of the Colonial Office, dispatched as a puisne judge to
Victor LA., Bribery must of course be ke away from
the judicial bench, but the question now is, why, with the
details of the alleged offence, under their very eyes, the
people at the Colonial Office thought proper to send the
alleged briber as a judge to Melbourne.
We are told the affair was “overlooked” by the under-
lings, but why are not the underlings themselves properly
overlooked and made to do their duty? It seems to be
allowed, that the Colonial Office having ruined MR. STONor,
will be obliged to effect the financial restoration of that
gentleman in the handsomest possible manner. Now we
are curious to know whether the “handsome thing” is to
be done at the public expense, or whether the aforesaid
“handsome thing” is to be done at the cost of those by
whom the very ugly transaction that has taken place was
perpetrated? As to the basis of the compensation, that
will have to be settled hereafter, but we presume the old
official standard will be followed, by giving something like
a sum not exceeding fourteen-twelfths of the whole annual
salary, with perhaps another office during the life of the
person to be compensated, and a few thousands per annum
for two or three generations of his posterity.
NEw WERsion of AN OLD SAYING.-There is but one
step from the Sublime Porte to Old Nicholas.
GREAT NEWS FOR ME, PUNCH*S “LITTLE
FRIENDS.”
“The United Association of Schoolmasters of Great Britain.” (says
the Morning Chronicle) is about to open a permanent exhibition in
London, containing specimens of educational books, maps, diagrams
&c. Mr. Punch, whose intimate acquaintance with everybody and
everything around him is only equalled by his willingness to impart his
knowledge to the public, hastens to offer the earliest information as to
the nature of this exhibition, and the character of the curiosities it
will contain. In it, he confidently affirms, will be found the rod which
was wielded by fronysius after he had resigned the sceptre of
Syracuse, and to this classical instrument will be appended one of the
advertisements in which the same worthy, announced to his young
friends (in the purest Greek) that the vacation was about to terminate.
This case of objects will command the attention of all profound
scholars, and those, in particular, who have devoted themselves to the
study of Greek roots will be pleased to have both roots and branches
at once presented to their view.
The next case will contain the bow and arrows with which the first
schoolmaster taught the first young idea how to shoot. On the bow is
inscribed this motto from HoRACE, “Non semperarcum tendit APOLLO,”
from which we may infer that the first schoolmaster occasionally gave
the first young idea, a half-holiday. In a third case will be found
NERO's copy-book, with copies in the handwriting of SENECA. From
the text-hand copies we extract “Error non est culpa,” and from the
round-hand, “Pravae intercommunicationes corrumpunt bonos mores,”
as specimens of sound philosophy and elegant Latinity. Side by side
with these samples of imperiaſ penmanship will be seen an imposition
assigned to the “little son” of CoRIOLANUs and VIRGILIA for playing
truant. The yo scapegrace had to write out a thousand times the
words: “I had rather see the swords and hear the drum than look upon
my schoolmaster.”. There is some reason for thinking that this relic was
once in the possession of SHAKSPEARE. Another conspicuous object will
pe the Mummy of an Egyptian Schoolmaster, who was embalmed in the
memory of his affectionate pupils. In the same sarcophagus with this
highly dried pedagogue were found the mummy of a cat of nine tails,
and a number of papyri. These last, when deciphered, proved to be
the holiday letters of the pupils, who, if we may credit their own asser.
tions, were so *W at school that they quite dreaded the approach
of the vacation. hen MR. PETTIGREw unrolled the schoolmaster
he was rewarded by the discovery of the original “Rule of Thumb,”
which was placed at the ends of the fingers of the mummy's right

quite supersedes the keys to WALKINGHAME and BoNNYCASTLE, and
is what schoolboys commonly term “a fudge.” It is therefore
reserved for the private use of the United Association of School-
masters. “An eminent draughtsman has promised to contribute
drawings, ground plans, and elevations of the AEdes Walpianºe; and
another artist will urnish similar sketches of the juice dom ;” and
a plan of the grounds surrounding that delightful mansion.
he schoolmaster, who has been abroad so long, has sent maps of
the countries through which he has passed with specimens of the
natural and artificial productions of many lands. But Mr. Punch has
not space to mention all the marvellous curiosities which this exhibition
will contain. He will conclude, therefore, by saying that MR. PAYNE
CoLLIER has contributed the satchel with which “the whining school-
boy” (mentioned by the melancholy Jacques) “crept so unwillingly, to
school.” The satchel still contains, some crumbs of unquestionable
antiquity, which Mr. Punch who has tasted them, unhesitatingly
pronounces to be the remains of a baked plum pudding.
NOT SO MAD AS HE SEEMS.
THE other day a lunatic ran up into a pulpit at Frome to demand
from the parson an explanation of his sermon. We do not understand
the precise ground upon which a verdict of lunacy has been returned
in this case, for we cannot think that the fact of needing an explanation
of a sermon is in itself a proof of insanity. . We have, often been
lunatics ourselves, if we might be pronounced insane for having been
puzzled by a discourse from the pulpit. Perhaps, however, the
alleged lunacy consisted in the absurd expectation of being able to
get the parson to explain himself. We admit the extreme impropriety
of the act of the individual who chose such an unfitting time and place
for the explanation he sought; but to pronounce him mad because he
was puzzled about the meaning of a sermon is a measure so harsh that
we call upon that eccentric society the Alleged Lunatics' Friends to
look into the case as speedily as possible.
An Extreme Case.
'Tis said, in language terse and meat,
Extremes will very often meet;
Perchance, then, at no distant season,
E’en Nicholas may come to reason.
REMovED to Moscow.—Nicholas, it is said, takes up his quarters
at Moscow, as being safer; thereby signifying by his absence from
St. Petersburg, that “rubbish is not to be shot there.”

we are credibly informed, instead of lighting himself to bed as formerly, with a
tallow candle, has a melancholy gas-pipe fitted up on the staircase, which, b
leaving the door of his bed-room open, enables him to undress and to get into bed.
Now, when we take into consideration the serious difference there is in price
between tallow and gas, and when we know what a sickly, unsatisfactory light the
latter gives, compared to the brilliance of the former, it will not be considered
presumptuous, we hope, to surmise, that before many weeks are over, both London
and Paris will be compelled—to avoid the increased expense—to remain in
darkness altogether.”

“The following cold-blooded insult to our beloved Emperor
will scarcely be believed. We stake our honesty, however,
upon the truth of it. In one of the lowest parts of London,
called St. Giles's, may be seen exposed, at a hairdresser's,
a large Bear, brutally ripped open, and over it is written,
in large characters, ‘ANother FINE RUssiaN BEAR

but we tell the Cabinet of St. James, that the animus
of it is as comtemptible as the sarcasm is weak.”
“The average height of your French soldier is four feet
three. The average height of your English soldier is
considerably under that.”
“We perceive that a contract for 600,000 puncheons of

“The Russian soldier can thrash three French soldiers at

other places, during §. late war. Now it is an established
truth that the French soldier is better than three English
soldiers under any circumstances. History has put this
latter fact beyond the smallest possible doubt, much less
contradiction. Consequently, if a Russian can lick three
Frenchmen, and a Frenchman is better than three English-
men, it stands to reason that cne Russian is more than a
match for nine Englishmen. However our first victory will
soon establish this point.”
“The English and French ladies are so terribly dis-
tressed for a proper supply of bear's grease, that they are
actually obliged to use lard for their hair; and when they
cannot afford that, they are too glad to avail themselves of
the assistance of a little butter. To economise upon the
latter article, some of the proudest ladies both in England

A PRUSSIAN COURT CIRCULAR.
HE following extracts from
the Prussian Court Circular
have been sent to us (we do
not mind acknowledging the
fact) by the valet of the KING
of PRussia. This will ac-
count at once for their authen-
ticity, to say nothing of the
nature of the document itself,
that carries within it the most
convincing evidence of the
truth:
“The King began dressing
by first putting on his stock-
ings, then he changed them
for socks, then he pulled
\ them off again, and seemed
undecided which he , should
put on. He remained in that
state for a quarter of an hour
wnen he sent in the greatest
hurry for his pedicure. In
the meantime, his Majesty
dressed, and when the pedi:
cure arrived, he said he did
not want him.
“At nine o'clock the King
rang for his shaving-water,
and when I took it to him he was very angry that I had not brought him his
chocolate, which was no sooner ready than he said he should prefer a cup of tea.
“The King, when dressed, was pleased to intimate his intention that he was
going to sneeze, but suddenly changing his mind, he coughed instead.
“The King, before going into the garden, stood contemplating two hats, which
Were hº in the e hall. One hat was white, #. other black. He first
put on one, and then the other. This he repeated at least a hundred times, when,
quite uncertain which one he should put on, his Majesty went out at last without
any hat at all.
“In the afternoon, his Majesty complained of a slight touch of the gout in the
right foot. His attendants, schooled by long patience and experience into the
instability of all royal wishes and feelings, sent for a quantity of ice; nor were
they much out in their calculations, for in less than ten minutes. afterwards, His
Majesty was attacked with a violent, pain in the head, and if the delay of, a
second had taken place in ; the ice to his temples, his Majesty, might
F. have changed his mind, and have been seriously laid up with an attack of
small pox.
“After dinner, the King ordered his carriage round with the intention of
repairing to the Royal Chapel. His coachman, however, drove him to the Opera
ouse. His Majesty seemed much pleased at the sagacity of the man having so
accurately anticipated his wishes.
“A Cabinet Council had been ordered at two o'clock, in order, to revise the
eternally-promised Constitution, which every right-minded Prussian has long since
abandoned all hope of ever seeing. The Ministers, when they assembled, surprised
His Majesty in the garden playing at skittles—an athletic game in which His
Majesty is fond of spending the greater part of his business hours. It was
curious to see the ministers, far from being surprised, pull off their coats, and join
their sovereign in the sport.
“The King, feeling unwell in the evening, sent round to the chemist's for “his
º The servant returned with a large box, which, upon being opened,
turned out to be a case of champagne. His Majesty took a couple of doses,
and felt considerably better.
“The King, before retiring to rest, wrote autograph letters to the QUEEN, or
NGLAND, and the EMPEROR of The FRENch, assuring them of his steadfast
(standhaffe) sympathy and cordial co-operation. This augurs favourably for Russia,
and, in fact, the troops were ordered the next morning to hold themselves in
readiness to march at a moment's notice towards the Austrian frontier.”

A BRIGHT IDEA.
TO RTURE OF A N UN.
(From the “Catholic Champion.”)
WE blush to record another of the hideous outrages perpetrated
upon Catholics by the furious bigots of the Law-made Church of
England. Unable to trust ourselves with the indignation excited by
the revolting detail, we will confine ourselves strictly to facts, leaving
comment to the faithful. - -
A deputation from the committee appointed by the tyrant majority
of the House of Commons, went, on Tuesday afternoon last, to the
newly established convent of Our Lady of Self-Complacency, at Bays-
water, and proceeded to exercise their function º Visitors. Every
cunning and artful device had been adopted in order, to disarm
i. and of the three commissioners, two were benevolently
loo ingelderly entlemen, fathers of female families, and the third was a
| ". and well-born M.P., the owner of large estates, probably stolen
y his ancestors from the Catholics of other days. The better to
conceal their views, the deputation behaved with the most hypocritical
affectation of courtesy, sending up their cards to the Lady Superior,
from whom they had previously obtained an appointment, and begging
that if the hour were at all inconvenient, she would name another.
But the holy and venerable Lady knew too well the malignant nature
of those with whom she had to do, to afford them a handle for accusin
Catholics of resisting the Legislature, and they were at once admitted.
..We might dwell upon the atrocious wiles by which it was sought to
disguise infernal persecution. We could tell how politely the bigots
behaved, how they affected to do their work with the utmost delicacy,
and how evidently they had determined that neither word nor gesture
should escape them that could be construed into insult or unkindness.
The sickening shallowness of the artifice could deceive no true child of
Rome. But it is to the abominable cruelty practised in one particular
instance that we would advert as calmly—calmly, ye blessed Saints—
as we may. - -
The persecutors, after a brief visit, were about to retire, really baffled
but pretending, to be all smiles and courtesy, when a young an
beautiful Catholic lady, Miss ANGELICA DANvfits (aged sixteen), and
who is shortly about to devote herself and her fortune to the convent,
happened to enter the room, and, almost before she was aware of it,
found herself in the centre of the ſº The tactics of the Inquisitors
instantly changed. They evidently beheld a victim, nor had her sweet
and cheerful smile, her fresh young loveliness, nor her musical voice,
power to deter them from their course. The venerable Superior left
the room to attend to those duties of hospitality which we are enjoine
to practise, even towards our enemies, and as the door closed, that
#!"; and helpless creature was subjected to Protestant barbarity.
We, dare hardly write the rest, but O ! gentle S. HookEy, and O'
kindly S. WALKER, give us strength. -
The poor girl was led to one of the massy chairs, in which, with a
Smile that might have disarmed a fiend, she took her seat, and she was
instantly asked by one of the elder, Inquisitors whether she did not
think it delightful weather. To this insidious question, framed to
extort an answer that might be construed into a desire to get, out of
the convent into the open air, Miss DANVERs replied, with the sim-
licity characteristic of our faith, that it was rather warm. The younger
nquisitor was then left to assail her, and he proposed a series 9
interrogatories, apparently founded on the topics of the º but really
designed to entrap her. At length, when he proceeded to the length of
asking her what she thought of the Qpera of La Pestale, even the
simple girl saw the allusion, and the future Nun hesitated to speak
decidedly of the Vestal; but said that good works should be held in
honour though they might not be understood. Angelic answer! But
it could not melt these savages. -- -
The Rack was shown her. The young saint regarded it with a
smile, and said that a sister of hers had gummed the Fº together,
and that she had only painted and varnished it; and she took out
Unsoftened by the innocent cheerfulness of the poor child, the
younger Inquisitor took up a piece of thin cord which was § on the
table and, tying its ends, put it over his two hands. She understood
the signal, and with a slight flush of modesty, held out her own white
hands for the torture. #. twisted and involved the cord with fiendish
ingenuity, and then transferred it, with a cruel smile, to her outstretched
hands, muttering some ferocious jest about cat's es. Yet, long as
the process lasted, for he took a strange pleasure in protracting it, and
alternately taking away the cord from her and putting it on again, he
could not destroy that smile-nay, more than once her laughtershowed
how a Catholic can defy Protestant malice. - -
Lastly, the poor girl was,subjected to the Question Extraordinary.

The younger Inquisitor, who,'despite his fierce nature, seemed strangely
fascinated by his unoffending victim—such is the power of true virtue-
drew near to her, and in a low, intense whisper asked her whether her
affections were en ..., Miss, DANVERs replied in the negative, but
hearing the footsteps of the Lady Superior, and wishing, even amid her
own sufferings, to spare the feelings of that venerable person, added, in a
low voice, “Here's Mother,” appending a simple exhortation which
from those pure §: ought to have had weight, even with the hardened
doers of wrong. She merely said, “Do right, do.” He seemed touched,
and was thoughtful during the brief remainder of their visit, which
was ended with all the hypocritical º with which it began: , .
b #.#! True martyr'ſ Noble soul! Thus to have suffered is
cuter -
Since the above was written we have received afflicting tidings. It
ap that the last words of Miss DANVERS to the young M.P., were
misinterpreted by him—that he did write, and that she answered him.
The result was that she left the convent, and they were married yester-
day. S. Hºokº, S. WALKER, another victory to these Protestant

THERE seems alittle difference of opinion as to the fitness of ADMIRAL

Some of our contemporaries appear to think, that for a man on active
service he has been acting somewhat passively. Others again are quite
the other way, of thinking, and congratulate the Government, upon
having made a happy choice. For ourselves we would Willº abstain
from offering an º in the matter: though were we asked to, do
so, we think we should scarcely be accused of anything worse than
Cockneyism, if we ventured our belief, that although possibly for the

CROWNED HEADS IN NIGHTCAPS.
HE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA-
according to a very minute
| narrative of the Times Corre-
* spondent—has had a dream
that has mightily comforted
him. We are not—after all
—all alike in our sleep.
When the crowned head
draws on its nightcap; the
head, even in its profoundest
slumbers, does not wholly
forget its anointed top. Even
in the cloud-land of dreams,
monarchy keeps its state |
Sleep, the great leveller, does
not make the Czar lie pros-
trate, that, even for a second
or so, he may take the knout
in lieu of the serf. No:
royal dreams are still royally
guarded;, and the nightca
of the imperor doth st
he about a right royal
skull. This is the creed of
courtiers; the religion o
the back stairs; although
r may avow themselves irreverent unbelievers, Be
this as it may, NichońAs has had a dream; which, dream, with his
constitutional condescension, he has narrated to his chosen of the
Court of St. Petersburg. It seems that St. NICHOLAS appeared to
the Czar, and—in his waggish way—quizzed the Emperor on his
affected devotion to the war. It was all a sham, and a flam, cried the
Saint; whereupon the Emperor swore it was all a truth-fruthful as
his own sword. Again the Saint appeared, again doubted, and was
ain emphatically rebuked by Heaven's warrior in jack-boots. A
#. time the Saint presented himself; a third time declared himself
dubious, when Nicholas reiterated his intentions of sincerity “on
W
§
s
the profane
the word of a gentleman.” The Saint could no longer oppose such
an expression of holy zeal so sanctified, but cried-"Go on, my Son;
go on, my NICHOLAsſ Proceed and conquer!” Therefore, Nicholas
is determined to storm Constantinople, and bow-string the Sultan on
the word of a gentleman! - -
This dream—we learn from private but most authentic sources–has
set nearly all the other crowned heads in a ferment, and royal brains
have wobbled with visions. The KING of GREECE has had his dream.
A few nights since he dreamt that the crescent moon of Turkey was
turned into a green cheese and that he was eating it.
A very §§. dream has disturbed the slumbers of the KING OF
NAPLEs. He dreamt that he was turned into a huge lucifer match;
and that one of his political prisoners, rubbing him against the bars
: aºn caused him to ignite, leaving behind him a shocking smell
Of Sulphur. -
The KING OF PRussia dreamt that he was turned into a gallantee.
showman's magic lantern; and that nothing came out of him but shams
and shadows. -
The poor Pope dreamt that he had become a bomb-shell, fired into
the Eternal City for the punishment of his flock, Feeling himself
about to burst, he awoke supplicating the saints to “save the pieces.”
The EMPEROR of Austria dreamt that he was turned into a sword,
and that presenting himself to NICHQLAs of Russia, NICHOLAs, grasped
the handſe; when, immediately the blade melted away in blood-drops.
About to go to press, we have received the following account from
f|our own Correspondent at St.Petersburg of the last dream of the Czar:
a dream only known to himself and our informant, who writes as fol-
lows:– “St. ºf: April 1. His Majesty has dreamt, a dream.
He thought that Death, the skeleton, appeared to him with a boot-
jack in his bony hand; and grinning a horrid grin, said-Mayit please
our Majesty—just for the peace and contentment of the world at
e-be good enough to take off your boots.”

the advantage of strengthening our connection with France.

“That the success of England in the present war will tend to rivet still more firmly
the chains upon Ireland, and that every Irishman who enlists in the British Army
takes side with the foes of his country, and aids in her enslavement."
We hope MITCHEL will continue to write thus. His ink-bottle can do

A CRITIC TO LET.
Does MR. CHARLEs KEAN want a young man with some impulsive-
ness and a good flow of ink, to write the criticisms on the productions
at the Princess's Theatre?.. Because, if so, he might hear of such a
young }.} at Belfast. The excited party who does enthusiasm for
the Belfast Evening Mail says (of some MR. SULLIVAN, as it happens-
but, bless you, to a young man who writes like this, it does not matter
on what peg he hangs his inspiration):
“His conceptions of character are accurate, and his developments true to nature,
which is the highest state of perfection to which imitative art can rise. Above all, he
has soul, and it is that which surprises, enraptures, and transports his audience, so that
the one feeling of enthusiastic iration actuates them, and the theatre reverberates
with thunders of applause.”
Such a writer ought not to be lost to the London press. And the
reason why we commend him to MR. KEAN is this, that we think that
entleman's literary staff may be short of hands, as the notices of the
ast Princess's farce were given at considerable length in two of the
daily papers and—curious coincidence—in the same words—which was
hardly fair to the editors.

A GOOD END ;
OR, THE REWARD OF THE RIBANDMAN.
“MR. PUNCH,
“PRORABLY there are not many people who rejoice in an entirely
..º. conscience. . If there are any, your humble servant is un:
happily by no means one of them. I endeavour indeed to do as I would
be done by, perhaps with some success, but in striving to perform what
is right and avoid what is wrong in other respects, I know I very often
fail shamefully. Few of my misdeeds have hurt anybody but myself-
but that self I am afraid they have hurt, very much....Had I to drink
hemlock Hº: I should not be able to do it, like Socrates. I
could not lay my head on †. composedly with such º:
º of what I should have to say for myself on waking would
trouble mes. Even Johnson owned that his self-consciousness would
be reflected by a voice in the air which should say, SAM JoHNson, you
- y -
are a very wicked fellow !' I wish I were no wickeder a fellow than
SAM Johnson. - - - -
“Well, Mr. Punch, you will say, all this is making you my Father
Confessor: I had better choose another. Well Sir ; º had: a
regular one: such a Father Confessor as either of the two priests by
virtue of whose shriving the three Ribandmen, who were hanged the
other day at Monaghan, were enabled to die apparently not only better
than SocRATEs, but as well as St. STEPHEN. The Northern Whig
contains an account of the execution—perhaps I ought rather to say
artyrdom-of GRANT, QUIN, and Coom Ey, the individuals alluded to,
for the murder of MR. BATESON. . I subjoin a few passages from the
reporter's statement illustrative of the euthanasia of these men:—
“Yesterday morning, through the courtesy of MR. TEMPLE, the Governor, I was
permitted to see the three prisoners. In company with some others, I found them
walking in one of the yards of the prison, after having largely partaken of an
excellent breakfast. QUIN and GRANT were smoking, and the three appeared to be
in the best of spirits. I expressed, as did several of the party with me, my regret at
seeing them in their unfortunate position; and QUIN and Coomey both replied in the
strongest terms, that they were fully prepared for the fate that awaited them—that,
thanks to the attention which had been paid them by their clergyman, they were ready
to meet their God. In the course of the conversation which ensued, CoomEY particu-
larly entered into religious topics, remarking that he never, in the whole course of his
life, felt so happy as he did at that moment, with the confidence before him of, in a
brief time, Ineeting his Saviour. . . . On our leaving, the unfortunate man shook each
of the party warmly by the hand, and expressed a hope that when we were about to
die, we would be as fully prepared for it as they then were.”
“ Unfortunate men?—unfortunate epithet: words should be better
weighed though, at a penny the line. . Happy individuals, favoured
persons, I should rather say. Hamlet wishes to know who would not
destroy himself if he could "...}. the ills of life by committing suicide.
Who would not much more willin % be hanged; regarding the subse-
quence of hanging with the eyes of GRANT and CoomEY –
“‘Throughout the entire conversation GRANT and Coomey spoke with a spirit and
freedom which was perfectly astonishing—looking at their approaching end as a
merchant might be supposed to do on entering on a prosperous enterprise, which would
reap for him rich and glorious results. MR. Swanzy, the sub-sheriff, called upon them
in the morning, and on going up to them, said he was sorry to see three men in their
position. “Sorry!" said one of them in a tone of surprise. “Why, it is glad you
should be, Sir!”.'
“So I think I should say if I were going to be hanged for murder:
‘It is glad you should be, Sir–glad that this world is going to be rid
of me: wish me as the Judge did, mercy in the other!' It does not
seem that this was quite what the prisoner meant:—
“‘He then asked them if they had any statement to make to him in relation to the
offence for which they were to die? “No,” said Coomey, “our Saviour said nothing
when he was executed tº '
“A certain thief, however, did say something on the occasion to which
Cooney alluded:"confessed the justice of his sentence: and this is the
case of the two, one would think, that CoomEY might have considered
the more analogous to his own.
“CoOMEY and his companions preserved their exalted frame of mind
even on the scaffold. QUIN and GRANT were first hanged:
"... In passing from the yard to the pressroom, an incident occurred, which, though
trifling in itself, tended to show QUIN's state of mind. Clothed in their dead dress, the
two men, passed through the yard, each in company with his spiritual adviser, and
during, the time they were shaking hands with some officers of the prison, the
Rev. Ms. SMITH had passed some distance in advance of Quin, when the latter came
skipping after him like a schoolgirl, threw his arm round his neck, and drew him on
with a lightsome, hurried pace for a short distance.'
“Danced him, in short, to the gallows. I wonder if DR. CULLEN
approves of that sort of polka!
“QUIN said, “Hell cannot now scare us." (When the hangman pinioned his arms),
“He's doing the best job that ever was done for us.” (To the Rev. Gentlemen), “we
return jº many thanks, gentlemen. Will you not give us your blessing before
you go?”
“Both reverend gentlemen then blessed them.”
“'The Rºy. Ma. SMITH. “Remember the penitent thief on the Cross. In one moment
you'll be in heaven. You have eternal happiness within your reach.””
.."I think I need quote no further. Enough to say that Coomſby met
his fate,with such enthusiasm that it might have been imagined he
believed himself to be PolycARp.
“Is not this Irish deathbed—as I may venture to call it—calculated
to make .# frail mortal wish his death might, be like the death of
CoQMEY and his accomplices, and his latter end like theirs? Is not
such a scene likely to prove especially edifying to Irish spectators?
The cotton nightcap a crown of martyrdom; the gallows-trap a gate of
life!, this is indeed hanging Ribandmen to encourage the others.
Really, Father Confessors should induce penitents to moderate their
transports a little in undergoing º punishment for murder. Else,
perhaps, may it not be considered by the mob that the wilful murderer,
at least if a Ribandman, is merely a devotee that “wilfully seeks his
own salvation?’ ‘In one moment you'll be in heaven!’-a dying
philanthropist would be glad to be sure of that: a timorous hope that
in a single moment one may not find one's self elsewhere, seems as
much as can reasonably be entertained, in the highest state of reform:
ation, by any . ordinary person, who, though no felon, is well
aware that he deserves the appellation of “REUs.”
EUS.
THE LUNGS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
WE sometimes exult in being finer fellows than our forefathers,
because we have steam-engines and they had none. Certainly, on a
railway, in a dockyard, in a cotton-mill, in various other commercial
and national establishments, a steam-engine is an advantage which we
may well consider ourselves to enjoy over them. , Some, however, of
those machines afford us the reverse of any ground for boasting at the
expense of our predecessors; such, namely, as we employ, unsuccess.
fully, to effect . which they accomplished perfectly well without.
They erected noble public buildings, so constructed as to ventilate
themselves. They had no steam-engines, indeed, for the ventilation
of those edifices; but the edifices did not require any. According to
Mr. Spooner, the present House of Commons is ventilated by three;
two below, drawing air in, and one above #". it out. But
MR. Spoon ER says that the air is burnt and decomposed by this
arrangement; that it passes through chambers, one of which stands
over a great sewer; and is then forced up through the floor, saturated
with dust. The question is, whether the term ventilation can be
correctly º this process. If it can, then bees, when a hive is
taken, may be said to be, ventilated with brimstone; and small boys
may be described as ventilating an apartment, when they blow air into
it impregnated with smoke by means of a lighted tobacco-pipe and a
pair of bellows. -
The mistake—for to poison instead of purifying the parliamentary
atmosphere must be a mistake, else were it treason surpassing that o
GUY FAwkEs—has consisted in trying to cause the House to do that
which the desideratum is to admit of being done by the inmates. It
has been attempted to make the House breathe, whereas the endeavour
should have been to render possible the respiration of the Members.
The three steam-engines are a sort of lungs; but as this respiratory
apparatus is connected with a sewer, it performs an office .."; to
that of the lungs in the human bod , which serve to exhale vitiated
air and inhale pure º
Thus the House of Commons may be regarded as a huge monster
breathing foul air, and the Members (no offence to the irish Brigade
as parasitic animals which occupy its interior, and breathe the atmo-
º which the monster has breathed previously. This is a mixture
of deleterious and unsavoury fº. Not only that, but MR. SPOONER
also affirms that it is traversed by “whirlwinds and tornados of dust
flying through the house in a manner that is most disgraceful.” The
architecture of the House of Commons may be considered to have me-
cessitated this state of things; to which, however, a totally different
style of building would have been appropriate. ºffic House, to suit
such an atmosphere, ought to have been constructed with an entrance
like a huge dragon's mouth, having a row of enormous teeth in either
jaw, after a design which, we believe, will be found in some of the early
editions of the Pigrinºs Progress.
That all discussion is not stifled by air calculated to smother anybody
is a wonder to those who are ignorant of the adaptability of the animal
economy. Perhaps, as the wind of heaven is tempered to the shorn
lamb, so the air of the House of Commons is dulcified to honourable
members. It has been held that there is a mysterious relation
between things matural and moral. Rats live and thrive in sewers;
can it be said that a House wherein laxity of party-principle has become
general, is appropriately ventilated with air fo which a sewer is tribu:
tary The variations of temperature, occasioned by alternating jets of
hot and cold air, also complained of by M.R. Spoon ER, may perhaps
likewise be considered to represent the climate of England; and it
would be well if the opinion of the nation were represented as accu-
rately as its climate.
MR. Spoon ER declares that the sum of £200,000 has been expended
in order that the House of Commons may be º: with air—con-
sisting in a great measure of sulphuretted hydrogen. The name of
Spoon ER will shine the brighter for having called attention to this
throwing away of good money after bad gas; a gas, however, whereby
the first syllable of that name, considered as silver, would be very soon
tarnished.

MR. Pop FINGTON FLATTERs HIMSELF HE Is CREATING A SENSATION.—(Perhaps he is).
MISSING—GEORGE THE SECOND.
MR. THOMAs DUNgoy BE has threatened to bring the Great Globe about the ears of MR.WYLD,
who, it was º: had carried off the statue of GEORGE THE SEgoND from Leicester Square
to set it up on his own private grass-plot. Very odd is, it that our democratic friend of Finsbury
should be so suddenly smitten with sympathy for the statues of kings; the more especially
when—as was the sad, earthy case of GeoRGE THE SEconn—it was nothing more than mere
clay, with a coating of lead, and the thinnest over-coating of gilding. But it appears that the
statue was, from the first, private property; and therefore—long before its final removal—was
. a good deal of it, bit by bit, away by the ingenuous fellow-countrymen of the Irish
Imembers.
The statue had an outside of lead, and it so º when any of the Irish hodmen or
bricklayers engaged within the fortunate vicinity of the statue, felt upon them the inconvenience
ºf thirst, that, with a notion of the assuaging properties of porter, they did not hesitate to remove
from the statue as much lead as might, conscientiously weighed in the scales of a marine-store
purchase one, two, or three pots of malt, according to the modest necessities of the timi
yet withal thirsty Irishmen aforesaid. Now, here is a sum to be worked out by MR. MooRE
and other virtuous senators of his kidney, burning with indignation at the º bribery of
poor MR. Stonor: If the leaden tail of GeoRGE THE SEcoRD’s horse would go into twenty
pots of porter, how many pots would the head go into? To Irish members, so capable on
all occasions of making head and tail of everything, such calculation must be particularly easy.
Whilst, in the stern pursuit of our duty, we give this hitherto unknown history of the
lead of one, Member of the House of GUELPH, we must also, in justice to the ingenuous
Irishmen, who poured the lead melted into porter down their throats, speak of their unutterable
disgust when they discovered the statue to be, not at all at all what they first believed it—
a large lump of glistering, gold, but, hollow lead, with Dutch metal on the outside, and dirty
clay within. They were disgusted, because they were cheated. Nevertheless, they made the
best of the bad, and swallowed their disappointment cool from the pewter.
Alas, and, may it not be even thus with the living Irish member; the sterling, golden
M.P. for Potheentown?. He stands on the hustings one piece of unalloyed gold. Common eyes
cannot, loºk at his brilliancy for winking. He is a member of precious price, which he proves
when he bows to the minister, And then he rises in the house, and what seemed gold is
º to be the most dumpish lead: and-certain matters come out, and he is examined
y a committee; and—och, murder!—our golden member is a thing of the very dirtiest clay

CASES FOR THE PUBLIC CONSCIENCE,
EALLY we wonder that the frequent an-
nouncement of the receipt of Con-
science money by the CHANCELLOR of
THE ExchEQUER, does not urge the
conscience to act in a variety of ways
on those who, in some shape or other,
owe restitution to society. We cannot
understand why the conscience should
usually limit its accusing voice to cases
of unpaid income tax, when there are
a thousand instances at least to which,
if conscience were to act conscienti-
ously and indiscriminately, its moni-
tions would be appropriate. We can,
without hesitation, cite a few cases in
which restitution might be dictated by
conscience with the most unquestion-
able propriety. - -
Every barrister absenting himself
from the trial, of a cause in which he
has taken a brief, should return the fee and all contingent damages as
conscience money, to his client. - - -
The parson who has curtailed the bishop of a portion of his first
fruits should, at the voice of conscience, forward a pint of the earliest
gooseberries to the episcopal palace of the diocese. -
The dull Member of Parliament should send conscience money to all
readers of newspapers who have read more than six lines of six speeches.
All the metropolitan milkmen should send round conscience money
to all their customers who have been paying, for new milk from the
cow, and consuming a miscellaneous compound in which, the struggle
for ascendanc ..i. entirely between the pump and the chalk-pit.
We might, however, go on ad infinitum, in suggesting cases where
conscience should make restitution, instead of limiting its influence to
those frauds of which the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER has been
the victim. We have said enough to give the key note to conscience
for playing on the pockets of the public to a very pretty tune, and we
hope that instead of making cowards of us all, conscience will inspire
the public in general with the courage to acknowledge boldly all past
error, and to open the pocket with spirit in offering due recompense.
ALARMING STATE OF WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL.
WHAT cadastrophe can it be that has reduced the Cathedral Clergy
of Winchester to destitution? The Hampshire Independent contains
the announcement following:–
“Thr Cathedral Bells are to be chimed no longer for lack of funds to pay the
Ringers; so say the Chapter!!”
That the Reverend Gentlemen would—except under pressure of the
direst necessity—deprive any individuals attached in an humble capa-
city to the Cathedral of employment; that they would take bread
out of bell-ringers' mouths to put money into their own banks, is
incredible. We are therefore grievously afraid, that by some misfor-
tune which has not as yet n explained, the capitular estates have
ceased to pay, and the Canons have been all ruined. Our melanchol
imagination depicts them going about out at elbows; in ragge
cassocks & la PARson ADAMs. Poverty, however, is no disgrace to
Evangelical men: nor is shabbiness a reproach to the cloth, unless it
can also be imputed to the wearer. t the tattered shovel-hat of
Winchester go round for subscriptions: or else, peradventure, the
next thing we shall hear will be that the Cathedral Service is to be
performed no longer for lack of funds to pay the Clergy.

TURPENTINE TURPITUDE.
ALL the enormous gooseberries chronicled in the newspapers are not
authentic. Neither, perhaps, are all the enormous acts. To the mere
invention of some reporter, fertile in atrocities, let us hope the Times
was indebted for the following case of
“Disgusting CRUELTY.-WigtoN, April 11.—At the petty sessions held here this
day, MR. Joseph RAILTON, of Snittlegarth, presiding, MR. Thomas HAY'ron, of
Gerrard House, near Wigton, owner and occupier of a large estate; Ma. GeoRGE
Hayton, his brother; and Robert HARDING, a husbandman, in the employ of the first
defendant, were charged, at the instance of the Royal Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, with having wantonly tortured a greyhound dog. From the
statement of MR. Foastrº, who attended for the Society, it appeared that on the night
of the 7th of March, the three defendants got possession of a greyhound belonging to
a neighbouring farmer; that, while the younger HAyton held its head securely
between his legs, his brother saturated the animal's hide with turpentine, and, setting
fire to it, drove it away. By some accident the flames were extinguished soon after
the dog reached the open air, whereupon the defendants again secured it and repeated
their brutal act, after which the affrighted animal was seen to leave the house a second
time enveloped in flames. As it afterwards appeared, the dog ran four miles to its
master's home, where it was next morning discovered in a dying state crouched up
under some straw, with its bowels protruding.”
Such barbarity would be quite incredible, were it not certain that
Nicholas EMPEROR OF Russia is at this time guilty of much greater
by plunging Europe into war, which is worse than dipping a greyhound
into spirits of turpentine and setting it on fire, inasmuch as thence will
ensue conflagrations of towns, cities, and ships, attended by the
combustion of human beings, and thus by the torment of our species
to an extent in the aggregate immensely É. than the agony, above
described as inflicted on a miserable greyhound. It is observable that
the HAYTONs, “ºf to the above description, are evidently
claimants of the title of “gentleman,” in, which respect there is an
additional resemblance between them and the Russian savage.
“The case having been satisfactorily proved by three witnesses, MR. WABRE,
solicitor for the defence, urged that the occurrence was purely accidental, and that the
dog had caught fire a second time from a cinder which had fallen out of the firegrate.
(A laugh.) The defendants had certainly applied some turpentine in the first instance,
and set light to it, but without any intention of destroying the animal. He hoped,
from the high respectability of his clients, that the bench would take a lenient view of
the matter, in which event, MR. HAyton would have no objection to recompense the
owner for the loss of his dog.”
. Respectability, according to THURTELL, is the quality which keeps a
gig. The high respectability of the HAYTONs, probably—unless their
case is merely a horrid º: romance-keeps a dog-cart; a
vehicle for the conveyance of dogs, for sport: , such sport as the
entlemen (of the Russian sort) had with the farmer's greyhound.
However, the height of the HAYTONs', respectability was such that
justice could not, it seems, reach up to them.
“The magistrates having consulted for a few minutes, the chairman prenounced the
decision of the bench. After administering a severe rebuke to the elder HAyton for
the unseemly levity he had exhibited during the proceedings, MR. RAILtoN said, the
bench had no doubt whatever that a most wanton and cruel act had been perpetrated,
and that the charge had been fully brought home to the accused parties, who would
each pay the highest penalty imposed by the act, viz., £5 and costs; or, in default,
stand committed for six weeks to the county gaol. In pronouncing this decision, he
felt bound to add that it was not the unanimous opinion of the bench; but a majority
of the magistrates being in favour of the imposition of a fine instead of a committal to
prison, he was bound to give effect to the opinion of that majority.”
If the respectability of MEssRs. HAYTON had been no higher than
that which consists in keeping a vegetable cart, and their offence had
been no graver than that of beating, with a little too much force, the
donkey º: to draw it, they would at this moment doubtless be
expiating their guilt at the crank.
One of the Horrors of War.
“Like causes produce like effects.” An atrocious º: of alleged
robbery on the part of the EMPEROR of Russia has led to the making
of a pun of almost unheard-of atrocity. When it was rumoured that
the Czar had seized the furniture of SIR HAMILTON SEYMoUR, it oc-
curred to everybody that NICHOLAs must be mad, and this supposition
led to the frightful suggestion that to suspect the EMPEROR of insanity
for stealing an ambassador's chairs and tables was the most chair-i-table
construction to put upon it.
The czar's IDEA OF AN ANGEL.
Nicholas has called his brother-in-law, the KING of PRussia, “an
Angel of Peace.” . An angel—after the Russian view—has of course
two wings; one of infantry and one of artillery.

THE LORDS IN A BAD WAY.
ON the subject of war administration discussed lately in the House
of Lords, the Times observes:
“But, only think of this great question being debated with an attendance at first of
about 50 peers, and before the end of Lord Gary's speech not much more than a dozen!
Later in the evening a very important measure was read a third time, in a house of
exactly a dozen, the numbers being 7 content and 5 not content.”
The Peers are sometimes called an oligarchy, and certainly by mus-
tering on the most momentous occasions in numbers so very small as
those abovementioned, they seem desirous of meriting the appellation.
It is to be hoped that their Lordships do not intend to gratify the
extreme democratic party by gradually abolishing themselves as a
branch of the Legislature: * if they continue growing small by
degrees, and making themselves more and more scarce, they must
ultimately vanish.
Court Mourning.
THE Court has been ordered into a week’s–a little week's-decorous
mourning for the late DUKE of PARMA; , Ladies are to wear black
silk, and gentlemen black swords and buckles. It is believed that the
º exhibited at St. James's will be equal to the sorrow manifested
y the people of Parma. Quite.
THE PORT ADMIRAL OF SOUTHAMPTON.
At the annual dinner of the Members of the Southampton Chamber
of Commerce, according to the Hampshire Independent, the toast of
“The Army and Navy” having been drunk, the Mayor. (J. T.
Tucker, Esq.) returned thanks for the Navy, as “Admiral of the
Port.” It is not, perhaps generally known that the MAYQR, or
SouTHAMPTON is also, by virtue of his office, Port ADMIRAL of that
flourishing maritime town. Should an invading squadron ever get past
Calshot Castle, it would of course be his duty to blow it out of the
water, unless it stuck º in the mud. From this duty there is
no fear that he will ever shrink; in the meantime we hope his exertions
will only be required for the more agreeable one of giving friendly
visitants a blow-out. The MAYok of South AMPTON, of late years,
has always been ready to afford friends of all nations a bellyful, and no
doubt the present Mayor will also contribute manfully towards #.

who is Admiral of the Port, and may that Port never fail to exhibit the

Port, but also of the sherry, as well as of the claret and the champagne!

BISHOP JANUS ON PUSEYISM.
Divers inhabitants of one of the fashionable districts where the
elegant subscribers to the Church, and its other habitués amuse them-
selves with Puseyism, have appealed to the Bishop of lonDoN to
interfere, and to stop practices which, to the memorialists, appear to
savour of Popery. ey have stated their fidgets at some length, and
DR. BioMFIELD, with his usual promptness, has made a lucid and
energetic reply which has just º in the dail papers. It will
settle the question of the right of clergymen to add “attractions”
and “effects” to the English. Protestant Liturgy, and Mr. Punch
has therefore much.pleasure in giving it immortality.
The Bishop of London to the KNIGHTSBRIDGE PURITANs.
“MY DEAR BRETHREN,
- “I have received your letter, complaining of practices
which you say are introduced by your clergyman, the, REVEREND
MR.L.In DELL, into the services at St. Paul's, Knightsbridge. I fully
admit that every member of the Church of England has a right to
complain to the bishop of the diocese, but at the same time I deny that
the conduct of the clergy ought to be made the subject of lay censure,
and therefore, while responding to your appeal, I decline to answer
your complaint.
“You object to the Flowers upon the Altar. Iown that they are
nowhere expressly ordered by the Prayer Book. But, in the time of
Edward the Sixth, floriculture was not so well understood as it is
now, and perhaps if it had been, flowers might have been appointed as
church ornaments. I am confirmed in this view by finding, in the
sermons of the bishops who edited the Prayer Book, many favourable
allusions to flowers, and beautiful lessons drawn therefrom. At the
same time, if any particular scent gives the ‘...; or even the
beadle, aheadache, that flower ought not to beincluded in the bouquet.
I need hardly add that I am also strongly º: to the Pagan flower
galled “Venus's Looking Glass,” and to the flower familiarly called
Jump-up-and-Kiss-me, and if the rose should be thought to lean to the
confessional, I think M.R. LIDDELL must exercise his own discretion as
to the propriety of retaining it.
“You object to the Cross upon the Altar. This is a mere question
of heaviness. I am told that it is a very light one (sic), and therefore
ought not to weigh much upon your minds. Remember that there is
a cross on the top of St. Paul’s, yet I have not heard that Messrs.
DARIN AND Co., MessRs. GRANT AND GRIFFITH, or other inhabitants
of the churchyard, against whose orthodoxy nothing has ever been said
to me, demand that it should be taken down. And Imay add that
there are several crosses in the Crystal Palace, which will shortly be
opened on Sundays (with the approbation of myself and my episcopal
brethren), and therefore offers a parallel case to that of a church.
II have the best authority for stating that no such acci
admit, however, that if the cross had been a heavy one it would have
been a different thing.
“You object to the Intoning the Service. This is really matter of
taste. I would rather hear good intoning than bad reading, not that
I accuse MR. LIDDELL of reading badly, because, as you must have
observed, Ireally know nothing about the circumstances, and indeed
the presumption is that as he writes very well he will read well also.
But as I cannot say that anything which tends to harmony is improper,
I can only suggest that there are plenty of churches where the service
is read abominably enough to satisfy the most particular Protestant.
“You object to the Chorister s. I agree with you that, as a
general rule, boys are a nuisance, in º and everywhere else. But
boys have a clear common law right (See BURN's Justice) to go to
church, and when there, to sing; nor is there any statute or common
law, preventing them from wearing their shirts outside their other
clothes. If there were, I fear the smock-frock, so interesting a feature
in our country'congregations, must be interdicted, and I am sure you
would not desire an agriculturist to worship in his waistcoat. As
regards the boys not using their handkerchiefs, I think it is a clear case
for MR.LIDDELL’s personal and continual watchfulness and interference,
and that of every lady member of his family, and I have given him a
wipe on the subject. As regards, their struggling for apples, pinching
one another, and introducing irrelevant remarks, connected with
dinner, into the responses, I deem it a case for the beadle's cane.
“You object to the Perpetual º Iquite agree with you, and
think that no persons should bow in church except when they see an
acquaintance, when, of course, common politeness dictates a smiling
recognition, whatever, part of the ceremony may be going on. But
this practice is too universal among the orthodox to need my sanction.
There is a very good paper in ADDIson's Spectator on the subject,
but i. its argument goes the other way, you need not read it unless
you like.
“You object, to the Procession of Clergymen. ... Now here you
are wrong. ‘Procession’ is derived frcm the Latin processio (See
AINsworth's Dictionary), and means the act of proceeding. If you had
studied logic, you would know that the service could not proceed
unless some one proceeded to perform it. Well, if you are not
Dissenters (which - - - -
only ought to perform the service. Ergo, the procession is right. This
#. I have thus happily been able to dispose of, I trust to yºur
satisfaction, by means of the classical information I acquired in earlier
life, and which has assisted me in obtaining one or two other
desirable ends. -
“Thus, my beloved brethren, I have set all your minds at rest, and
it only remains for me to hope that in future you will not trouble me
with such appeals, for they entail great vexation upon me. Circum-
stances change, and with them Bishops' opinions, but litera, script,
manet, and it is disagreeable to be accused of condemning in 1844
what one encourages in 1854. Go quietly to church, and if you do not
like what is going on, go quietly to sleep, so that the peace of the
Establishment may not be disturbed.

THE POSTMAN OF EUROPE.
R. WINCKE called
Prussia “the Post-
man of Europe”—a
postman who was al-
ways carrying letters
backwards and for-
wards between Rus-
sia, England, and
France. There is no
disgrace in the mere
fact of being a post-
man; the disgrace, in
this instance, lies in
the uniform which the
postman wears, and
which happens to be
that of Russia. There
is not a penny post-
man attached to St.
Martin's-le-Grand,
who would carry let-
ters for such a Post-
master-General. We
propose a monster
portrait of FREDE-
Rick be h up
over the Post-Office
in Berlin, in which he
shall be represented
as a Postman with
the º ſº,on,
Carrying a letter-bag,
Oil § shall be
stamped a large brass double-headed Eagle. The Prussian Monarch's name will be hence-
forth identified with that of the celebrated “WALKER, the twopenny postman;” or it is
prºbable that he may supersede at Astley's, and other equestrian circles, the ſame of the
‘Courier of St. Petersburg,” for the KING of PRussia has been figuring away lately in no
better character than that of grand Dispatch-bearer of NICHOLAs.
A FORM OF BEQUEST.
A MR. Holford of the Regent’s Park, has left all his large fortune to the PRINCE of
WALEs. A noble and a patriotic gift....MR. HolroRD had no particular knowledge of the
budding goodness of the PRINCE or WALEs; but having once seen his Royal Highness
knuckle down at taw, MR. H., was convinced that he would become a glory to the nation;
having once beheld him trundle his royal lº Mr. H. cºncluded that the Prince would
º a master of the whole circle of politics. Therefore, MR. HolroRD left the PRINCE or
WALEs all his large fortune; and who shall impugn the sanity, the benevolence that dictated
the golden bequest ? Not Punch.
But as it is becoming a fashion (did not NIELD leave £300,000 to the QUEEN ?) to
bequeath, money to the illustrious of the land; Mr. Punch–ſor the convenience of his
friends—begs leave to submit the subjoined Form of Bequest, to the many enlightened
persons who will in the due course of the present mania, bequeath their fortunes, large or
small (if large the better), to him—Punch.
FORM OF BEQUEST. -
I, A. B., being of eccentric mind—but by no means mad, for I have employed no doctor—
[this may or may not be inserted, according to the fact]—do, in consideration of º
esteem, admiration, love, and enthusiasm of the many noble and exalted qualities of Mr. Punch,
as exercised by him for the benefit of the universe, at 85, Fleet Street, in the City of London,
do bequeath unto him [here insert sum] together with aſſ [here put in houses, messuages, plate,
horses, pictures, &c. &c.; though it will materially aid the simplicity of the transaction to say
ALL AND EVERYTHING without further circumlocution] of which I die possessed.
oUR SCORE AGAINST NICHOLAS.
IF Income Tax be doubled
To pay the cost of arming,
If Traffic’s course be troubled
By dreads and doubts alarming;
If our funds in price be fickle as
The glass on an April day,
We owe it all to Nicholas,
AND NICHOLAs shALL PAY!
If the authors of Improvement
In State or in the Church,
Are barred from onward movement,
If Lond JoHN’s left in the lurch,
If to ask Reform’s ridiculous,
If abuses still bear sway,
We owe it all to Nicholas,
AND NICHOLAs shALL PAY!
If our allies be slaughtered
By this “gentleman” deceiver,
If our choicest troops be quartered
In nests of plague and fever,
To be mowed down by death's sickle as
You mow a field of hay,
We owe it all to Nicholas,
AND NICHOLAs shALL PAY!
If the orphan's cheek be slubbered,
And the widow’s heart be chill,
If there’s bare shelves in the cupboard,
And a vacuum in the till,
If, in short, we’re in such pickle as
War brings, go as it may,
We owe it all to Nicholas,
AND Nicholas shALL PAY!
If from quiet sleep we’re shaken
By unwelcome roar of battles,
If the Sultan's land be taken,
And SEYMoUR's goods and chattels—
From sublime unto ridiculous,
If we find “the prigging lay”—
We owe it all to Nicholas,
AND NICHOLAs shall, PAY!
If a long-quenched fire be heating
Our English hearts and hands,-
If our ploughshares we are beating
Into bayonets and brands;
If to war—pastime periculous—
We're invited, far away,
We owe it all to Nicholas,
AND NICHOLAs shALL PAY.
If Jack be beat to quarters,
Some, we know, must pay his shot, -
If the Tartars should catch Tartars,
As 'tis as like as not;-
Let those who try to tickle us,
If tickled, mind what I say—
They owe it all to Nicholas.
AND NICHOLAs should PAY!
Francs and Dollars.
And I am the more induced to make this wise and benevolent bequest not in respect
to any want soever that may be felt by Mr. Punch, for I know he can roll in gold, and rub
himself dry with bank-notes—but in respect to the exercise of my own will, feeling that to
leave money to hospitals, asylums, schools, alms-houses, or any other institution for the
alleged relief, benefit, and protection of the human-kind,-is to make a very vulgar use of
money that ought, by mat attraction, to meet money. As steel runs to magnet, so should
gold go to gold. Thereſore I leave [here repeat bequest] to Mr. Punch, not because the value
of the bequest can help him, but because it pleases me. - -
And further, I beg of SIR PETER LAURIE, as Governor of Bedlam, to carry out my wishes:
knowing that, in so far as regards Mr. Purch, it will be to Sir PETER a labour of love.
The testator—if wishing to keep his last will a secret from his poor relations—may have
the above quietly, witnessed, by calling up the cook and getting her to call in the police-
man, who will both put their hands to the same.
THE MonitoRIAL OUTRAGE.-Everybody must have been disgusted with the recent case
of bullying at Harrow. We trust that the “Monitorial System,” which has been established
at that public seminary for young gentlemen, will be so modified that we shall never again be
shocked by such harrowing details. -
THE decimal coinage question is gathering
strength. The Times PLUTUs of the Money
Market proposes that our tenpenny piece should
be ...} a franc, “which expresses its value
all over Europe,” and further, that our piece of
fifty pence or 4s.2d. be called, in compliment to
America, a dollar. Perhaps no measure could
be better calculated to increase brotherly love
among France, America, and England. That
national hearts should beat towards one another
is all very well: but what are hearts to pockets-
what feelings to francs—what duties to dollars?
MoNEY AND ITs MoRAL-It is impossible for
a man to make ducks and drakes of his money
without, at the same time, making a great goose
of himself.

|PENITENTIARY DRILL,
HERE was a letter from a
correspondent of the Times,
under the signature of M.,
proposing that Government
should try if some use could
not be made of the better
sort of convicts by forming
them into an “Experi-
mental Brigade,” with a
#: #. i. *::::::::
emif possible. Regarde
superficially, this project
may appear open to deri-
sive , remarks. For the
Cav of the “Experi-
mental Brigade.” may be
suggested the title of “Her
sty's Horse Guards
(Black).” . A force constituted of convicts should, it may be said, be
divided into regiments each named according to some characteristic
delinquency. Thus one regiment would be termed “The Light Fingers;”
another. “The Heavy Burglars:” others being designated as “The
Footpads,” “The Forgers,” “The Smashers and Coiners.” A Second
Regiment of Convict Dragoons might be composed of “Horsestealers: ”
the “Sheepstealers” also forming a s of their own. The Infantry
might be recruited principally from the London Pickpockets; and the
sharpest of the thieves generally might be selected for Riflemen. The
uniform of the various regiments might be pepper-and-salt, or fustian
with different facings in each instance, and also for either side of
each soldier; his right facings green, for example, and his left yellow.
Finally it may be recommended that they should usually be played
into action with the Rogues’ March.
To the above observations it may perhaps be sufficient to reply, that
as the military drill is capable of straightening the shoulders of a
stooping bumpkin, so if extended to moral slouching, it may perhaps
also render a rogue upright, and ultimately enable many a shamefaced
offender to hold up his head.
THE PUFF SUBLIME AND RIDICULOUS.
THE following advertisement appeared in a recent number of the
Court Journal. We are at a loss to determine the category of puffing
to which this announcement ought to be referred, and we must leave
our readers to decide whether it belongs to the puff blasphemous or
the puff mythological:—

desirant éviter tout désagrément, et surtout empêcher que l’on ne se serve de son nom,
en ce que plusieurs employés se sont fait passer pour ses frères; Mons. FELIx a
l'honneur d'informer sa noble clientelle qu'il n'a pas de frère, et que pour cette saison,

expressement pour cette année.

We recollect hearing a posture-master at the opera described, rather
impiously, by himself and his admirers, as “the God of the Dance,” but
the {...} .# Hair-Dressing is a divinity unknown to any system,
however degraded, of ancient or modern ..".
The advertisement we have quoted represents the hair-dressing god
as “descending” in Regent, Street, and appearing to “le célèbre
Edouarp,” whose celebrity is, as far as we know, bounded by the
walls of his own establishment, for we, in our happy ignorance, never
heard of him. It seems that “the god ” had been working last season
very inferior agencies, whom we suppose we must—in con-
tinuation of the isºl allegory—describe as the “fallen angels”
of hair-dressing, and who have offended by claiming brºtherhood
with their great master. LE GRAND FELIX indignantly disclaims the
possibility of such an affinity. He “knows no brother! has no brother!”
and will “bear no brother near the throne” of hair-dressing. He and
the célèbre EDouard will alone execute those miracles of hair-dressing
which they have “composed expressly” for the present season.
We can excuse the musical fanaticism which canonises a MozART or
even a MENDEIssohn ; we can forgive even the insanity that screams
out IoWBacche over a grand old fugue of BAch; but to attribute any-
thing Hivine to the composer of a head-dress—the maker in fact of a
wig–ilmplies an amount of infatuation and fatuity combined which we
cannot believe to be co-existent with the merest outline of humanity.

The Pope's Palm Branches.
THE Pope was last year so bothered for palm-branches, that this
season he has blessed three hundred at one breath, and benevolently
bestowed them upon the pious, to be worn in their button-holes.
Whilst the Pope is blessing his palms, it is not unlikely that MAzzINI
is binding together his birch.

(Slightly improved from Pope).
WHILE Reverend SUMNER draws up Wednesday's prayers,
Punch to the Tuileries in wrath repairs;
And entering, in the glittering rooms he found
His friend the Duke, whose useless arms lay round;
While opera-glass, white glove, and crush chapeau,
Denote far less the Warrior than the Beau.
Him thus inactive, with an ardent look
Great Punch beheld, and high resenting, spoke.
“Come, GEORGE, is this the time for fête and dance?
Why lingerest in the brilliant halls of France?
Russia and Greece against the Turk conspire,
Who begs his slow allies to open fire;
Along the Danube ABDUI's champions fall,
And the fierce Cossack climbs o'er TRAJAN’s wall.
DUNDAs lies idle, or from sulk or fear,
And ice impedes the keels of bold NAPIER.
While thou art courting fair Eugenia's smile,

Our troops to hearten and their toils to share *
Start—and approve thyself the Moslem's friend
'Tis more than time the Russian's march should end.”
The manly CAMBRIDGE from the sofa sprung,
No vain excuses faltered on his tongue,
Eight words, alone he spoke., “By Jove, you’re right.
I’m off, my boy!” He said—and rushed to fight.

VERY interesting letters have passed between a Polish officer and

against the common enemy?” It is said that the EARL of ABERDEEN
will finally accept the offer, with this proviso—that the Poles must

THE ENGLISH GRAMMAR AND THE ENGLISH
- GOVERNMENT.
WE are sorry to have to announce, at the very §§ the war,
a frightful murder of the QUEEN's English by the English Government.
The new Orders in Council lately put forth in HER MAJESTY's name
a case, and indeed several cases of bad grammar, which prove that,
however capable our rulers may be of governing a country, they know
little of the government of verbs and substantives. We have neither
space nor inclination for, an elaborate criticism, but it will suffice to
É. an instance of a º from thoseMºjº". for which
BBETT published a work, and LINDLEY MURRAY sells at the
book-stalls. \.
We are told that \s.
“It is not Hen MAJESTY's intention to claim the confiscation of neutral property."
We should really like to know, in reference to this passage, how the
neutrality of property is to be ascertained. We have heard of “neutral
tints,” which might determine the neutrality of a picture, but we
should be º to decide on the neutrality of a chair, a table,
A sideboard, or any other article of furniture. The only strictly
“neutral”, piece of goods we can conceive is an object so clumsily
constructed as to be neither one thing nor the other. Perhaps, how.
ever, the Proclamation may be intended to recognise the new philo-
sophy of table-talking, and it may be the wish of the Government to
discourage as much as possible anything like a political bias in house-
hold goods, by protecting º: confiscation such goods only as
preserve a strict neutrality. ...We think it quite unnecessary to point out
any of the glaring faults in Grammar which the Proclamation contains,
and which will be obvious to the very meanest capacity. How these
errors escaped the capacity of the Government must, after the above
announcement, appear very remarkable.

DUET BETWEEN PUNCH AND THE BRITISH
PUBLIC.
HE following Duet
has been written to
the very easy and
agreeable Air of
“My Pretty Page,”
in order that it
may be sung every-
where and by every-
body:—
British Public. My
faithful Punch,
look out afar,
Look out, look out
afar !
Hear you no tidings
of the war,
No tidings of the
warf
Punch. The British
fleet at rest I
See,
With sailors whist-
ling o'er the
lee.
British Public. My faithful Punch, look out again,
Look out, look out again;
See you no fighting on the main,
No fighting on the main f
Punch. No, dearest Public, all is still,
All, all is still;
Save when some Turks the Russians kill,
Some Turks the Russians kill.
British Public. My faithful Punch, look out once more,
Look out, look out once more;
Hear you the British Lion roar,
. The British Lion roar?
Punch. The British Lion's tail I see,
Wagging most portentously :
And now I think I hear him roar
Louder than e'er he did before.
But, dearest Public, much I fear,
'Tis but an empty roar I hear.
British Public. Oh mind what you say !
Have the fleet gone to play?
Did I send them away
For an idle display ?
Punch. I know what I say:
Now you’ve sent them away,
I hope for the day
When they'll get into play:
I shall cry if they don’t.
British Pablic. Oh mind what
you say !
Did I send them away
For an idle display, -
I shall cry if I did, &c. &c.
|
-
Punch. Oh 'tis true what I
Say!
Though I hope for the day
When they’ll come into play;
I shall cry if they don’t, &c. &c.

whole squadron, in the circular order of sailing.
A FRIENCH AGGRESSION.
AMONG the other afflictions of the House of Commons is one
MR. FitzSTEPHEN FRENch, an Irish Member, who has lately taken to
popping up in every di ion, and impeding the debates with some
commonplace or other of exceeding dulness. Of course FRENGH has a
lº right to do this, and other people have an equal right to laugh at
rtinacity. But when FRENch commits a furious and unprovoked
onslaught upon innocent arithmetic, the man who would refuse to
stretch forth his hand to rescue addition in distress is unworthy to be
the countryman of CockeR.
A night or two before the holidays a Committee was being appointed.
This . Committee, consisted of fifteen members. The nominator
explained that he had taken pains, the question being one of party, to
select as nearly equal numbers as he could. He had taken eight |
gentlemen from one side, and seven from the other. But this would
not satisfy FRENCH. He popped up, as usual, and had got ever so far
into his speech before the |. knew what he meani. It was then
discovered that he was complaining of this mode of reckoning.
.* But what could I do?” asked poor MR. ForsTER, the nominator,
piteously. “I can’t get more than eight and seven into fifteen.”
This view of the case seemed to strike MR. FRENCH for a moment,
and he may have been counting the Committee on his mental fingers.
Perhaps he reflected that though, in his own Roscommon, such a paltry
Saxon #. as arithmetic offered would have been scoffed into contempt,
it would hardly do in the presence of Exchequer Chancellors GLADsroNE,
DISRAELI, GoulBURN, BARING (not to mention SIR CHARLEs
Wood, who is rather more of a Roscommon arithmetician), to insist
that in a committee of fifteen the two sides should be of equal number.
At last the light shone upon the FRENCH mind, and he dashed at the
loophole through which it gleamed:
| “I would appoint men of sense.”
It was bold. But the House saw MR. FITZSTEPHEN FRENch's
evident device to evade serving (though the precaution was needless,
for nobody asked him), and another insult was heaped upon Ireland by
its being agreed that eight and seven did make fifteen. However, we
hope that FRENch will bring the matter again before the House after
the recess—it will, at all events, give him the chance of making another
speech. Perhaps the real secret of his wrath against arithmetic was
that having, the night previously, been boring the House at an unseemly
hour, he had been himself “counted out.”
A Windfall to the Prince of Wales.
A MERCHANT, named HolroRD, has died and left all his large fortune
to the PRINCE of WALEs. What a pity there was no such sort of
enthusiasm in former times | If folks had only left fortunes to the last
PRINCE OF WALEs—who was duly festered into the whitlow GEORGE
THE FourTH–what money would have been saved the country! We,
however, may take some comfort from this growing desire on the part
of a rich and loyal people; we may cease to vote a single farthing, for
royal branches. In time, Royal Highnesses—like Royal Hospitals—
may come to be supported by voluntary contributions. -

THE HEIGHT OF IMPUDENCE,
Blackguard Little Boy (to Queen's Coachman). “I say, CoAcHY, ARE YoU
ENGAGED !”
THE DRAMA IN THE SUBURBS.
EveRY now and then an attempt is made to get up an interest in the metro-
polis for some little theatrical speculation in the suburbs, and we are told by
an advertisement or two that a dramatic season is about to commence at
Greenwich or Richmond, or Kensington as the case may be, with a powerful
company from London. The Theatre Royal Kensington used to be remarkable
for the largeness of its promises and the smallness of its performances; until
a few years ago the proprietor, finding no other chance of filling the pit,
converted it into a public bath, in which condition it knew, for the first time,
the reality of an overflow. The private boxes were converted into dressing
compartments, and the scenery was transferred to the walls—an arrangement
which enables the bather to swim from the Bay of Naples to Venice, and back
again, in three minutes and a half with, or without, the friendly aid of corks and
bladders. Instead of a suburban Shylock in a Holywell Street hat and a Hounds.
ditch gaberdine, strutting before the Rialto to a fourpenny pit and a twopenny
gallery, the Kensington schoolboy now gazes on the view of Venice from the
centre of the bath, which his imagination transforms into the middle of the
Adriatic. This illusion is far more complete than any that was produced at the
Kensington theatre in its palmiest dramatic days, when the great tragedian
MACKEAN had been “secured” to perform the highest possible tragedy at the
lowest possible salary.
We have been led into these reflections by an announcement of the opening
of a country theatre with a company of the highest talent from the Theatres
Royal Drury Lane, Lyceum, and Manchester. The names not having been
given, in the advertisement, it is possible that the élite of those establishments
may be performing incog., with a lofty disregard of personal renown which
actors, in general, are not distinguished for. The most touching part of the
advertisement is that which intimates that “an omnibus will be in attendance
at the close of the performances” to take the audience home. Alas! we have |D
seen audiences for which a cab might have been sufficient, and even then the
driver would not have been in a position to charge for an extra passenger.
QUERY on CAVALRY.—If a CoIT’s revolver is not a horse pistol, the question

HYMN TO ST. NICHOLAS.
(By his Namesake.)
SAINT, of Russia's empire holy,
Whom as Patron we adore,
See a client, bending lowly,
To thy picture, kiss the floor,
Me, Lieutenant of thy throne,
Me, thy name who likewise own.
Thou the favoured land defendest,
Smelling sweet of tar and pitch;
Thou thy guardian arm extendest
O'er the race in tallow rich.
Ever be our hides thy care;
Still preserve our caviare.
Chiefly prosper the incursion
I have made upon the Turk;
Islam's surely thy aversion,
Deign to bless the holy work.
Are not we thy special charge,
Whether captive or at large?
Not for help do I beseech thce
In a Russian's name alone,
For I trust my prayer will reach thee
In another, no less known,
As pertaining to a class,
Sacred to St. Nicholas.
Thou of all, in every nation,
Art believed the friend to stand
Who subsist through depredation,
By the strong or stealthy hand;
Thou defendest all who seize
On “material guarantees.”
Whether territory grasping,
Or a table, guard me sti
Bless my clutch, whatever clasping,
Stranger's sticks or subject's till,
Empire, Ottoman by name,
Or the chattel called the same.
Though I be with foes surrounded,
Though the constables increase,
Let me never be confounded.
Lo! Great Britain her police
With the French against me bands:
Keep my collar from their hands!
–
FIRST STEPS IN WARFARE.
THE most important military movements that have as yet
taken place, have been principally those which have been ac-
complished by the energy and activity of distinguished officers,
figuring in the “Lancers.” These exploits 'have been per-
|formed in the face of balls; but have not as yet encountered
the opposition of bayonets. The enemy’s flank has not in any
instance been turned, but the opposite #. has been met
hand to hand, and driven completely round about. Advancing,
receding, deploying to the right and left, and defiling about the
scene of action with a quick step, have constituted the most
important evolutions. The chasseurs have also distinguished
themselves by chasséing: but it cannot be said that the steps
hitherto taken in the conduct of hostilities have been limited
to quadrilles; for those warlike operations have also included
the “War Polka”. We trust, however, soon to hear that
our heroes have finished their galops, and are riding as hard
as they are able after the Russians.
Doubtful Diplomacy.
We are told to take heart from the pleasing fact that the
UKE OF CAMBRIDGE visits the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA. Is
the Duke about to startle the world as a diplomatist? We
do not doubt, his genius for the duty, but are afraid of his
extreme good-nature. It is an old axiom that you cannot
safely bolt a door with a tallow candle. Neither do we think
i. Austria will be induced to load her gun with Cambridge
utter.

THE POETRY OF POTATOS.
THERE is not, at first sight, any very natural affinity between
potatos and poetry; but we have received a circular from a potato
salesman in Newington who has, evidently, so much sensibility that
we should expect all his potatos to have watery eyes, from the sheer
force of sympathy.
His circular opens with a business-like avowal of his determination
to sell at a moderate profit, and we detect no gleam of fancy in the
layful allusion to the superiority of “a
first paragraph beyond a p
nimble ninepence” over “aslow shilling,” and a quaint offer to provide
“bags” for families to carry home their potatos in. Up to this point
the potato salesman alone is manifest; but, suddenly, #. poet bursts
forth in allusion to his “mother,” his “boyhood,” and his “father’s
homestead near the New Forest, in Hampshire.” It seems that his
childish recollections cling round an old saucepan in which his mother
was in the habit of cooking potatos; and, after exclaiming paren-
thetically, but rather prosaically “(Please to remember that it must be
an iron saucepan),” he goes into a rapturous strain on the mode in
which his mother used to “strain the water off her taturs.”
Having indulged the “pleasures of memory,” our potato poetaster
proceeds to give utterance, to the following gush of feeling, which
would melt or mash the hardest heart, and might extort a pensive sigh
from the most mealy-mouthed of critics. Speaking of his j.
potato-poet says:
“But she is no longer occupied in. the homestead, for her silvery hair tells me she
is not far from a better home. Well indeed do I remember the old farmhouse; there
I see my father still—the quiet village, with its humble swain,” &c. &c.
There is much more in a similarly touching style; but we feel we
cannot do justice to the potato poet in comparatively lifeless prose,
and we therefore will suppose that we have entered the warehouse
drawn forward two chairs, taken our seat by the dealer’s side, and
entered on the following dramatic dialogue:
CHARACTERS.
PotATO Port. STRANGER.
Stranger. How much are those?
Potato Poet. They’re a superior sort,
Grown in a garden where I passed my youth—
(Three pound for twopence)—'twas my boyhood's home!
Stranger. I’ll take sixpennorth. But you spoke of home–
Potato Poet. Oh, 'twas a lovely spot! (weigh out nine pounds.) -
Well I remember how my father sat
In his arm-chair—(now, can't you find the weights)—
He was the village HAMPDEN.
Stranger. . (That’s a bad un;
I’m not a goin’ to take that specky tatur).
Proceed. I love to hear romantic tales
Of youth's bright holiday—(That weight looks light.)
otato Poet. (It’s a good ounce in favour of the buyer).
The village bell is ringing in mine ears—
(BILL, there’s a customer in the front shop);—
My footsteps press again the vil green—
em cabbages must go to Number Six).
Stranger. How fresh the verdure of your youth appears;
How thickly memory is planted out
With roots whose seeds were sown in infancy.
(I’ll pay for the potatos). -
Potato Poet. (Thank you, Sir).
If that potato hath a watery eye,
Start not to see in such an eye as mine
The gushing tear; for I have recollections
Which fill the bursting warehouse of my heart.
Bear with me, Sir, I pray thee.
Stranger. - That I will.
But, though I bear with thee, there’s something yet
That I must with myself contented bear—
(1’ll carry these ºft. home myself).
Potato Poet. (I'll send them, if you please).
Stranger. I’d rather not.
Who's born to bear, must bear what’s to be borne. (Rising.)
Potato Poet (rising). I thank you, Sir.
Stranger. ---- At parting, take my hand.
Potato Poet. Most willingly. And, in return, I offer
This hand of mine—a market-hand of radishes.
[The STRANGER earit as the Potato PoET retires into his Ware-
house wrapped in thought.
A Good Omen.
THE first Russian prizes taken are vessels laden with salt: the very
article that we propose to put upon the tail of the eagle.
A MODERN MYSTERY.
ALEm Rolleston, a well-dressed but strange-looking
man, having a huge red beard and bear-skin coat,
was charged with loitering and sleeping in St.
James's Park, and refusing to give any account of
himself—The Defendant had been remanded for a
week, to enable Issrºoron WALKER, of the A Divi-
sion of Police, to ascertain if anything was known
respecting him. It was proved that for some time
past he had obstimately persisted in remaining in
the open park—literally taking up his residence
there; and, as he always appeared attracted towards
the royal carriages when they passed, the Police
had felt it their duty repeatedly to order him off;
but he invariably returned, and at length, being
unable or unwilling to state how he got his living,
or what were his motives for sleeping in the open
air, he was taken into custody.
The Magistrate cautioned him that he was liable
to a term of imprisonment as a rogue and vagabond
for sleeping in the open air, and advised him there-
fore not to repeat the offence, desiring the Police,
at the same time, to apprehend him if he did. For
this once he might be discharged.—Police Report.
Oh, who is this stranger so dark
With beard so suspiciously red,
Who spends all his days in the Park,
And never goes home to a bed ”
His object there's none can divine; .
Though harmless his manner and mien,
Some mischief he sure must design,
For he looks at the coach of the QUEEN.
To prison º lead him º -
Of course they are perfectly right:
His crime—doing nothing by day,
And sleeping al fresco at night.
Of punishment still to be feared,
T. Magistrate, shaking his head,
Has warned the strange man with the beard,
If he does not go home to a bed.
But oh, beak' of conviction beware,
est judges of learning and worth . -
Shall hold on appeal—None can sleep in the air
As long as he lives on the earth.
SCENES AT ST. PAUL’S, KNIGHTSBRIDGE.
FROM a memorial addressed by MR. WESTERTON, the Churchwarden
of St. Paul's, Knightsbridge, to the Bishop or LoNPON, it appears that
the performances of which that church was some time ago the theatre
are still going on to a great extent under the auspices of the HoN. AND
TEv. #º the incumbent; ceremonies observances being
practised, and use being made of ecclesiastical “properties,” in such a
manner as to impart a Romanesque character to the services. It is
due to the Bishop to say that he does express, his . of many
of the ſº monkeyisms, denounced by the churchwarden; but it
is equally due to truth to add that he disapproves of them with evident
reluctance. The subjoined allusion to the cross on the communion
table will exemplify the spirit of his lordship's reply to the memorial:—
“As this cross (which is not large and massive as you describe it, but small and
light) was on the table when the church was consecrated, though not seen by me, a large
offertory dish being on part of it, I am not satisfied that I have authority to direct its
removal without consent of the churchwardens and parishioners except by a formal
decree of the Consistorial Court. I certainly wish it to be removed, and should be
glad if the parishioners would agree to its removal without such authoritative
sanction.”
The Bishop of LoNDoN is said to be a wag, and no doubt he reads
his Punch—which is not the same thing with reading Joe Miller; as is
too generally the case in perusing jocular, publications. ... Were the
right reverend prelate indeed familiar with the class of witticisms
denominated “Qld Joes,” it is not likely that he would have penned
the above parenthesis of apology for the Puseyitical cross—an apology
which is identical with the celebrated plea,"'Tis only a little one.”
The same excuse will cover the introduction of diminutive images,
i. wafers, and infinitesimal beads, to which if there be added a few
indulgences and a little auricular confession, we shall have a totality
which may be regarded as a sort of petty popery. i
Criticism for the Author of Evil.
Though not present at the grand Review in honour of the DUKE
of CAMBRIDGE that lately took place in the Champ de Mars, we
effectually with the United Service in cutting up NICHOLAs.
may observe that we hope the contributors to that Review will join |

PAPER WONDERS.
THAT man is grass is, of course, a solemn truth, solemnly received;
but that nettles should be paper is a bit of news that will startle the
millions, Nevertheless, the Gardener's Chronicle declares that “nettles
and mallows, in particular”... make excellent paper. “The common
stinging-nettle” has a splendid fibre, and in Germany has been made
into first-class paper. At this very hour the world is so prosperous,
so well-to-do and well dressed, that commerce cries in vain for rags to
feed the paper-mills. , And here are millions and millions of reams of
the green material—the much-abused and long-neglected nettle—idly
growing in our very ditches. Will not MR. GLADstone look liberally,
scientifically at this enormous waste of greenness—this dreadfi
sacrifice of vegetable power? The Gardener declares that the fine old
English stinging-nettle possesses, a fibre “scarcely inferior to hemp.”
Hear that, Nicholas; and tremble at the rod of nettles in store for
the chastisement of Russian trade The like cheering authority also
assures us that the Spanish broom (Spartium funceum) makes, first-rate
§ but this scientific fact, we doubt not, has long been known to
panish statesmen; all Spanish bonds having been printed on broom
paper, that * º: be swept out of the Spanish memory as cleanly
as possible. . Be this as it may; let us as Britons rejoice, in the
possession of our never-failing crops of British nettles, ready to be
converted into “first-class paper.” And there is a hopeful moral, a
comforting assurance in this discovery, that at length does justice to
the scorned, abused, neglected, “common stinging-nettle.” A thing

THE MARINER'S COMPASS.
UR contemporary the Times
has, rather unceremoniously,
but to all appearances quite
logically smashed the Ma-
riner's Compass, and pro-
nounced it an unsafe guide
for even the best ships, with
the most experienced crews
and the most able captains.
The following opinion has
been given by an experienced
aquatic authority, CAPTAIN
Diggles, of the #.
dilly, who has been nicknamed
the Admiral of the Whitey-
brown, from the colour of his
countenance:-
“As to the Compass,” says
CAPTAIN Diggles, “why
hitch up my old trowsers and
splice my main braces, if I
ever could see, with my dear
eyes, the use of a compass or
a pair of compasses in the
Navigation of the River.
M. Odds tars and tarpaulins!
# who would stand to look at
a compass with a coal barge
bumping down on your
weather side, and a wherry
under your jee, with a cap-
ful of wind blowing the hat
off your head, and no more
sea-room than enough to
get your boat's head in be-
tween the shore and the
shingles. The only compass
I ever trust to, is the compass
and if I don't make other craft steer according as I calls out to 'em, it's
there's an end on it.”

THE LIVERPOOL CHURCH IN DANGER.
THE following paragraph shows the frightful effect produced on the Church in Liverpool
b § i. of the parishioners to contribute three farthings to the wants of the
tablishment:-
“CHURCH-Rate Refused Is Livºnpool—After a contest of unexampled duration, the parishioners of Liverpool
have refused to vote a church-rate of three farthings in the pound. The poll closed yesterday (Tuesday) with
the following results—the majority against the rate being 537 persons, and 412 votes. The churchwardens state
that in consequence of this decision, 2 clerks, 7 sextons, 2 organists, 10 singers, and 21 bellringers must at once be
discharged from their connection with the parish churches, and that no sacramental bread and wine, and other
expenses—such as inºcººlinº cleaning, &c., can be allowed to four other churches. The result of the
polling was received with loud cheers.'
We used to regard as rather an unmeaning song the old distich commencing
“I owe you five farthings,
Say the Bells of St. Martin's
but we now see a closer connection between farthings and church bells than we ever dreamed
of. When we find that the refusal of three farthings can knock off at one blow twenty-one
bellringers from a provincial town, we can easily understand the influence that a debt of
five farthings º have had on the beils of St. Martin's
We presume the unfortunate bellringers will be without a- from the decision of the
parishioners, who seemed so satisfied with their own work, that they cheered the announcement
which intimated the necessary.discharge of a batch of clerks, organists, singers, and sextons
in addition tº the twenty-one individuals who have hitherto been hangers-on to the parochia
bell-ropes. We may, at all events, congratulate Liverpool on the comparative quiet it will
henceforth enjoy, for the officials who are to be discharged are all, in some way or other,
connected with the production of noise, and are pro tanto disturbers of the public tranquility.
... Some of our readers will be a little shocked at the rather unseemly juxtaposition of certain
items in the latter Fº of the paragraph quoted above, which furnishes a by no means
uncommon instance of a tendency on the part of the Church authorities to mixupwashing-bills
and cleaning expenses with matters of a more sacred character. There is something rather
disagreeable in the idea of being called upon to subscribe for a clean surplice for the
clergyman, as a portion of our contributions to religious purposes; and we would rather
that a reverend pastor should follow the advice of NApoléon, and wash his dirty linen at
home, if he cannot make himself fit to be seen in the pulpit without sending round to
*† the means of º his laundress.
e mendicant habits, of the poorer clergy are indeed becoming so troublesome, that a
day scarcely passes without our receiving an envelope containing a card with a slit
cut in it, for the convenient transfer of any coin from a sixpence to a sovereign, as a
contribution to some hard-up Reverend. As
the Friend of the Clergy are going to have their
usual dinner in a few days, we trust the subject
of clerical washing bills will be taken into con-
sideration, and arrangements made to secure to
every poor parson a surplice, sufficiently clean
to prevent the necessity for such dirty and shabby
appeals as we have alluded to.
SHAVING FOR LADDES.
CERTAIN, quacks are advertising “Roseate
owder,” described as “the most certain and
elegant preparation for the removal of super-
fluous hair on the arms, neck, and face, so
inimical to beauty,” and “Poudre Subtile,”
which “removes that great disfigurement to
beauty, superfluous hair on the face, neck, and
arms, in less than ten minutes, without pain or
º to the skin.” There are just two methods
of removing hair; cutting and burning: and as
powders cannot cut, those abovementioned must
operate by combustion or chemical corrosion,
which amounts to the same thing. How it may
be º to corrode or burn hair, without
producing the same effect on the skin whence it
grows, it is not . to conceive; but if the thing
could be managed, the razor would soon be
entirely superseded. We wonder whether the
“Roseate Powder,” or the “Poudre Subtile”
could be emplo ed, instead of boiling water, or
blazing straw, for the purpose of scalding or
“swealing” a pig.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Monsieur CLIcquor THINKs IT safeR To TAKE SHELTER TILL THE
ShowFR PASSEs over.
THE “GENTLEMEN” OF THE BAR.
The Bar must be a very honourable Kº: because we are
always hearing from the Members of the Bar themselves that the pro-
fession is not only a most honourable profession, but the most honour-
able of professions. It is true that there is often a broad distinction
between profession and practice, which distinction accounts º:
for the fact, that while the Bar is the most honourable of professions
it is not inconsistent with the most degrading practices. barrister
may ally himself with the lowest class of touters for the purpose of
extracting a base fee from a pocket that is filled with the pickings of
the pockets of other people; a barrister may fratermise with..s
attorneys and their pseu o'clerks, and representing, himself before, a
facile †. as “regularly instructed,” may be allowed to swindle
somebody or other out of a fee; a barrister may do this, and more
". this, and may yet remain a Member of the very *honourable
profession.”
We shall be told that the practices to which we allude are peculiar
to the scum and the of the Bar, but that we shall never find
men, holding a recognised rank in the profession, descending to any
practices unworthy of a “barrister or a gentleman.” .
rºAs the Bar declares itself the arbiter of what is becoming to its own
dignity, we must leave the Bar to decide on that part of the question;
but we must take leave to determine according to our own view how
far certain doings º, Bar may be conformable to the conduct of a
gentleman. It may be professional, but it is scarcely gentlemanly to
impute fraud to witnesses, though we are aware that there is plenty of
precedent, among even the leaders of the Bar, for implied and direct
accusations of a still graver character. It seems to be perfectly
“professional,” when defending a murderer, to suggest that the murder
may have been committed by one of the witnesses-a course that was
adopted a very short time ago by an eminent Old Bailey barrister on
circuit—a worthy follower in the school of the advocate of Courvoisier.
It has been urged that it is unfair to judge of the Bar as a profession
by that portion which selects Newgate as the field for its exertions,
but we regret to find that Westminster Hall furnishes instances infº
which some of the most respectable names at the Bar may be found in
connection with º such as a Barrister may not be ashamed to
avºw, but which a gentleman would, we think, repudiate. The
following extract from a law report in the Times affords a by no means
singular specimen of forensic taste in the Superior Courts and among
the higher grades of the profession:-
“In this cross-examination of the plaintiff by Ms. SenſEANT BYLEs, he was asked
whether he had not suggested to the defendant that there should be a robbery at the
Great Globe, as many shillings would come in from persons coming to see the place
where the robbery was.
“Ma. WYLD most indignantly denied this, and added that no one who had not been
the associate of thieves and convicts would have suggested that such a question
should be put.
“The learned Judge told Ma. WYLD he should only give the denial.
“The plaintiff said it was a most offensive question,
“The JUDGE. That may be.
“Upon the question being repeated,
“The foreman of the jury rose, and said he thought it a most improper question;
it was one totally irrelevant to the inquiry. As he understood the case, it was
whether the defendant had deceived the plaintiff and the public, or whether the
plaintiff and defendant had combined together to deceive the public.
“Ma-Senjeant Byles said he must do his duty.
“The JunoR. Yes; but draw it a little mild—a little mild.”
Here we find MR, SERJEANT BYLEs asking a witness whether he had
not proposed to obtain money from, the public upon a false and
fraudulent pretence-a question which, elicited an indignant denial.
The º Judge, feeling no doubt that the question was perfectly
professional, put no check on the tongue of the tº, but rebuked
the witness for his indigmation, and told him “he should only give the
denial.”. The question was admitted by the Judge to be “offensive,”
but the “Rule of Court” seems to be, that rs are privileged
offenders, and that witnesses must be made the objects of such offences
as barristers may choose to commit—there, being no rebuke to the
wrong-doer from the Judge, who is ready with a reprimand instead of
protection for the wronged party.

MR. URQUHART'S MARES NEST.
In an address to the inhabitants of Manchester, according to the
Times, MR. DAVID URQUHART said— -
“The nation is plunging into a war. In ignorance it believes it to be made against
Russia. I know that it is made in concurrence with Russia, and this *:::::::: it is
y
which urges me to make you this proposal. It is with Turkey, and ultima with
France that you will fight, unless your hand be stayed.”
There is or was a “Clergyman of Cambridge University,” who
having cured himself of a nervºus or mental complaint, offered, “from
benevºlence rather than gain,” to cure others. We will not say that
MR.U.R.QUHART would be a º: subject for the benevolence of thi
Cambridge Clergyman; but the reverend gentleman's charity might
usefully bestowed on the meeting which Nº. URquhart ...i. in
convening at the Corn Exchange, to hear him expatiate on the above
propositions. There may perhaps, be some little hope of them. In
e mean time, how true it appears to be that one hāividual like
MR. Unquhart makes many,
Manners for the Million.
Nº anybody the lie, however gross may be the falsehood he
utters. . To him whº says the thing which is not, it will be a sufficient
rebuke to answer, “That’s a Nicholas.”

MILITARY MESS-BEER.
He “CANNON BREWERy” has for
some time existed; but brewing is
now §§ in a corps not con-
nected with the Ordnance. The fol:
lowing paragraph, from the United
Service Gazette, records that advance
in military economy:-
"CoNCENTRATED BEER For THE ARMY.-
The Infantry .#. of Guards are to try
the experiment of brewing their own beer
in their barracks. The process is most sim-
F. and requires only a certain quantity of
ot water to render the concentrated r
palatable drink. Ten non-commissioned
officers are told off to try its effects. They
are allowed to drink as much as they please,
but restricted from taking any other beer, or
spirits. The porter is º: of, but the
ale is not a favourite. This introduction is
most important to the troops now proceeding
to the East.”
Fiat experimentum in corpore vili,
says the proverb; which by the
above account seems, with regard
to the “Concentrated, Beer,” to
have been translated, “Try the º: on a Corporal:” unless the
ten non-commissioned officers told off to test the “effects” of the
liquor include sergeants. Certainly the Infantry. Brigade of Guards
cannot be regarded as a corpus rile, or vile corps, but on the contrary,
must be acknowledged to be a “crack” regiment. We cannot help
questioning the palatable character said to be imparted to the concen-
trated beer by hot water. Hot water at an early º of º; ls
requisite to constitute a mash;, but if added to malt liquor after fer;
mentation seems unlikely to make anything but a mull. The “ effects”
produced on the subjects of the experiment, would, we should fear, be
of an antimonial nature; and what confirms us in this apprehension, is
the statement that those individuals are allowed to drink as much of
the beverage as they please. To be at the same time restricted from
taking any other beer may be a .# but is a hard, condition; for
we apprehend that any other beer woul be preferable to the concen-
trated after dilution. # is not wonderful that the ale is not a favourite;
and most likely it requires *...] liquorish tooth to approve of the
porter. The introduction is no doubt most important to the troops
going to the East: and its consequences indeed may prove extremely
serious.
THE CIVIC FAST.
THERE is but one Lord MAYOR in the United Kingdom who could
have been supposed capable of issuing such a summons as that whereof
the subjoined is a true copy:-
4.
“Youn Worship is desired to be at the Mansion-House on Wednesday next,
the 26th day of April, 1854, at Two of the clock in the Afternoon precisely, to
BREAKFAST, in a Black Suit and your Scarlet Gown, afterwards to proceed from
thence to St. Paul's Cathedral, on foot; being the day appointed by Her Majesty for a
General FAST and Humiliation. * C. W. Hick, Swordbearer.
“N.B. The Lord Mayor will leave the Mansion-House at a Quarter before Three
o'clock, and Divine Service will commence at arºuarter-past Three o'clock precisely.
“Swordbearer's Office, Mansion-House,
“Friday, 21st April, 1854.”
The foregoing composition, but for the Cathedral therein specified
being St. Paul's instead of St. Patrick's, would of course be ascribed
by everybody to the LoRD MAYOR or DUBLIN. His worship, is
requested to come to the Mansion House on the Fast Day to break his
fast, and then to walk to church. Moreover, it, being also the day of
Humiliation, he is directed to put on a Scarlet Gown.
Scarlet, Gown and Lobster Salad are perhaps the Mansion House
equivalents to Sackcloth and Ashes.
How jolly it would be to fast, that is, to break-fast at the Mansion
House every day! How fat a man would get in a Lent of fastin
there! Only it is to be feared that gout would be the result of suc
abstinence; or that the loss of blood and the use of cooling medicine
would be necessary thereafter. -
His Worship may be supposed to have really fasted all the morning
of the 26th, and not to have broken his fast until 2 P.M. But that is
a charitable supposition. The probability we would bet upon is, that
he ate a hearty breakfast of eggs and ham, or bloater and buttered
toast, with tea or coffee at ten or eleven, and broke his fast, of three
or four hours duration, a second time at the Mansion House... For the
municipal refection it will be seen, that three quarters of an hour
were allowed; a time sufficient to enable an Alderman to put a great
deal of pigeon-pie, and various other things, out of sight.
However, there seems much sense in the view propounded by one
of the clergymen who preached on the day, in question-to the effect
that, fasting, in the present era, should be a spiritual instead of a
bodily mortification; and therefore we do not blame the LoRD MAYOR
and Aldermen for satisfying their appetites, even if they appeased
their hunger with cold capon, and their thirst with champagne.
must be recollected that they had to walk all the way from the
Mansion House to St.Paul's, having less, than half an hour to do the
distance in; so that if they had not broken their fast at the former
edifice exhaustion must have occasioned them to break down on their
ourney to, the latter. Indeed they may reply to the charge of fast
reaking, that a walk of that length, within that time, is quite fast
enough for any alderman.
Important to Wounded Seamen.
Though success may attend some of our naval operations, the results
of others will certainly be unfortunate, unless our fleets are well sup;
plied with surgeons, which they are not likely to be until medical
officers in the navy are placed on something like the footing of other
officers and gentlemen.
ADWICE FOR MARTINETS.
MILITARY authorities should consider, whether it would not be
advisable to abate a little of their solicitude, for the tidiness of a regi-
ment, and pay somewhat more attention to its mess.
THE FRUIT OF CLOTHING COLONELs.
A slang name for certain cavalry regiments is, we believe, “The
Light Bobs.” Perhaps LoRD CARDIGAN's Hussars may be termed
“The Bob Cherries.”

LAWYERS IN AUSTRALIA.
... WE have read some sad accounts of the glut of lawyers
in Australia, and we are told of a barrister who has been
obliged to turn . in which capacity he has had several
NWAR, heavy cases entrusted to him. e suppose the bar still
--- stick up for professional etiquette, and when a load is
HUMILlation too heavy for one, the leader no doubt insists on its being
endorsed regularly by being hoisted on to his back with the
rofessional intimation, “With you MR. So, AND So,” who
is “instructed” to lend a hand with the burden. Many
learned gentlemen, who have been accustomed only to con-
sider the weight of evidence, are obliged to make them-
selves acquainted with the weight of furniture, or anything
else they may be employed to conduct through the courts
—- and alleys of Australia.
The only really satisfactory part of the business must
be the “refresher,” which in the shape of porter is no
doubt very acceptable to those who are compelled to make

for the knot, but it is certainly a more profitable employ-

A CONJUROR'S DIAMONDS.
THE Wizard of the North pays a very flattering com-
liment to the intellectual perceptions of the citizens, of

convincing reason; he has “appeared before every monarch
of Europe,” and been duly jewelled by the same. But

ENGLAND’S WAR WIGIL.
By solemn custom in the olden time
The squire deemed worthy to be dubbed a knight
Kept vigillone, from evensong to prime,
ithin the church—all in his armour dight.
And standing reverent, or kneeling low,
For past misdeeds did Heaven's forgiveness pray,
And guidance ask that he might bear him so
As true knight ought—in deed and word alway.
And, when the shadows of the night had waned,
And while the matin mass the priests intone,
He on the altar laid his sword unstained,
As dedicate thenceforth to GoD alone.
So kneels our England e'er she goeth out
A knight—to battle in a godly cause,
Humbling herself—but not as one in doubt,
If God will bless the weapon that she draws.
She layeth down the burden of her sin,
Knowing it great, and hard to be forgiven;
And, for the strife that she must now begin,
Looks up for strength where true strengthis—to Heaven.
And Heaven will hear her prayer and aid her hand,
For it is lifted to defend the weak;
To put down force and falsehood from command,
And Heaven's own vengeance for ill deeds to wreak
Then stand by, selfish scoffer, with thy sneer
Of “Cross and Crescent”—creeds to deeds belong.
The Holy Symbol we then most revere
When we deny its power to sanction wrong!

MOUSTACHES IN THE BANK.
SoMEHow or other, there is in the Gentile world an antagonism be-
tween moustaches and money i oddly enough £ s. d. will have nothingto
do with the least assertion of “tip.” The young men of our generation
have been exhorted to lay down, their razors and to take up with
moustaches: many unsophisticated enthusiasts have answered to the
appeal with somewhat of the vigour of a SAMSON, putting, as it may
be, the hairiest or downiest countenance upon the movement. On this,
the tyranny of bare-faced MAMMON asserts itself in MAMMON's very
highest place—yea, in its golden pulpit. Gallant, young clerks of the
Bank of England were beginning to grow good promissory notes of
moustaches, when MAMMON, looking upon these hirsute shootings, cried
—“Shave, young men: shave, or resign.”. This is a hard, tyrannous
fact. The youths of England, entrusted with the treasures of the
Bank, were ordered by a certain day to present, clean faces or each
a fairly written resignation. They did both: that is, they one and all
exhibited their resignation, by sacrificing the objectionable hair. And
this is called a free country; in which a man is not allowed to keep his
moustaches and his place! It is whispered that the shorn young
gentlemen have drawn up a petition to Parliament in the matter; a
§. to be presented by MUNTz and supported by ColoneL

IT appears that we have, during the last quarter, derived an enormous
and unexpected revenue from tea. It is hoped that the money thus
obtained will go some way towards the expense of the war, and that
by the aid of our Hyson we may defray some of the cost of our
Gunpowder.

ERUDITION UNDER BONNETS.
- ATER PUNCH, - My
attention has been
attracted by some ad-
vertisements, in the
Times, of certain Col-
leges for Ladies-ad-
mirable institutions,
no doubt, if properly
conducted. The list
of studies put forth
as the curriculum pur-
sued at one of these
seats of learning
comprises so many
branches of know-

suitable husbands for them. "That, however, will perhaps be got over
if their erudition include a knowledge of common, things. . They are
instructed, Iperceive, in Algebra, Geometry, and Arithmetic ; in Biblical
Literature; in Botany, in Dancing and Exercises; in Drawing, both of
the figure and landscape, with Perspectiye ; in flocution; in Englis
Grammar, Composition . and Litérature: in French; -
perienced by them in finding
graphy; German; in Harmony and Composition; Histºry, ancient and
modern; Italian; Latin, and aturall’hilosophy; Pianoforte; Singing;
and Spanish.
All this is very well., Nay, Greek might have been included in the
course, and there is no objection that I see to the addition of Hebrew.
But are the Mathematics which the young ladies-Very *:::::::::
simple or mixed?. The latter, I hope. I trust that the Algebra wi
be taught with a view to practical application in calculating the results
of shopping; and that the Geometry, will be subservient in some
way to the cutting out of frocks. I also trust that the Botany will
have a certain reference to dealing with the greengrocers; the Drawing
to the preparation of .." for the table; the Elocution to speaking
out ; of coquetting; the Composition to the admixture of ingre-

Opera, and all fashionable topics, and be accustomed to society. They must be
well practised in the Polka, Waltz, (single, as well as a Deuz Temps), Schottische, and
not be above dancing in a Quadrille, if needed. They must be single, and not exceed
the age of Forty. They must not refuse to dance with an elderly lady occasionally, if
the size of her property is such as to warrant the presumption. The terms offered, in:
cluding a Champagne supper, are of the most liberal description, and may be ascertained
at GUNTER's, St. James's Square, or of the Secretary of the “Disraessed Young
LADIRs' ELEGANT PARTNERs' Association,” at Hanover Square Rooms. Young
Gentlemen presenting themselves must bring with them a white neckcloth, as a
specimen. Not the slightest objection, at present, to Officers in the Militia, but no

trouble himself by applying.

TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES AT ST. PETERSBURG.
THERE is no reason for
doubting the facts alluded
to in the following -
graph from the #.
foreign correspondence:–
“If our accounts from St.
Petersburg are correct, some
of the Russians have made
great pecuniary sacrifices. The
well known Count ANATOLE
DEMidoff, whose revenues are
enormous, is said to have placed
them at the disposal of the
state for the duration of the
war, while BARoN STIEGLITz,
the Court banker, has volun-
tarily contributed 300,000 silver
roubles. A Russian financier
may be an exception to the
general rule, but moneyed men
seldom or never have the
patriotic feeling so strongly
developed as to part with a
sum equivalent to £55,000 or
£60,000 sterling.”
Of course a Russian
financier, is an excep-
tion to the
|
eneral rule.
Financiers of most other
countries engaged in war-
fare, limit their patriotic
- contributions to paying
their war-taxes—with or without grumbling, as the case may be. For the
Sovereigns of other nations, for the most part, carry on their wars by means of
nationaſ taxation; and if our double income-tax is a partial impost, still the con-
fiscation is Parliamentary and Constitutional. But Nicholas is a “gentleman”
who seizes upon material guarantees. That gentleman would assuredly have over-
drawn his account with BARON STIEGLitz by a sum considerably exceeding 300,000
roubles, if the Court Banker had not volunteered that amount as a material
guarantee for honouring a larger cheque on demand. If Mr. Punch were a Russian
subject–supposing the possibility of Punch's existence in Russia-His Majesty
doubtless, would exact a material ntee from Mr. Punch, unless Mr. Punc
prevented him. . He would lay hands on, and approximate the till of Mr. Punch
and his strong box, and the whole of his extensive stock forming the present
publication, together with his few back numbers, and all his other stocks, and
shares, and estate-real and personal—and his stick, and all his sticks; and his
cattle, and his dog Toby, as material guarantees of Mr. Punch's good behaviour.
The only method by which iſz. Punch could prevent the Imperial Gentleman from
thus making a material guarantee of his whole property, would be that of
surrendering the greater portion of it. He would willingly resign £60,000 to
his Emperor, if he possessed £60,001, and think himself lucky that his sovereign
master permitted him to have one other sovereign in the world.
In reference to the tremendous sacrifice above mentioned, it may be observed
that the “God of the Russians” begins to require offerings, as his worshippers
are discovering to their cost. It must be so, if they will worship such a god; the
Russians will be obliged to sacrifice money as well as children, to MoLocH. .
THE COINAGE OF THE BRAIN.
DURING the Easter recess there has been some difficulty in filling the news;
papers; but happily the paragraph-mongers came to the rescue with their usual
alacrity. The most original idea which we have met with, and which stands
out in grand contrast to the early gooseberries, and other common places of the
kitchen garden, is the discovery in a ditch of some hundreds of coins, with
341 ounces of silver, and several hundred battleaxes, all marked with Roman
characters. This has been a most fortunate find for the penny-a-liners, though we
have not heard of anyone else having derived any profit from the digging up of so
much wealth, which will no doubt disappear as soon as the necessity for furnishing

The whole of the articles enumerated are said to have been found in an urn,
which was, it is to be presumed, the depository of some Roman miser's earnings.
How they came to be so long overlooked, and how it is that those who made the
ditch never noticed its contents, nobody attempts to explain, mor is it worth while
to inquire. It is enough for us to feel that we are always protected against the
possible barrenness of our newspapers, by those timely treasures, which are lying

POODLE MEPHISTOPHELES AT THE PRINCESS'S.
No man, like a Frenchman, can trim a poodle. This, we believe,
may be conceded as a national merit. No man, like a Frenchman, can
so quickly teach a poodle so many tricks; to fetch and carry; stand on
three legs; pick letters from a biscuit alphabet; and, in a word, do
all the things that make the cleverest of dogs. The skill of perfect
teaching cannot be denied to the patience and intelligence of French |b
enius; and, assuredly, MONs. CARRf has marvellously vindicated the
llic ability by so, trimming and teaching Goethe's Poodle, alias
Mephistopheles, that his originator would never know him again.
“Seest thou the black dog"—says Faust to Wagner—“ranging through the corn
and stubble?
Faust. Mark him well I For what do you take the brute?
Wagner. For a poodle who, in his way, is puzzling out the track of his master.
Faust. Dost thou mark how, in wide spiral curves, he quests round and ever near us?
and, if I err not, a line of fire follows upon his track.
Wagner. I see nothing but a black poodle.
Such was the conviction of Mons. Michel CARRE; and so, in 1851,
he goes to work, and trims and shapes GoFTHE’s poem of Faust into a
thing for the French stage: and the thing—poodle-like—having had its
run upon all-fours in Paris, may noy be seen under the very moral manage-
ment of MR. CHARLEs KEAN, in Oxford Street. A mere poodle; and—
for a poodle—one of the dullest dogs that ever defeated a teacher. But
that the poodle should have been trimmed by a Frenchman was,
doubtless, its excelling recommendation to a manager who prefers his
plays, even as his gloves, to be of Paris make. They can be so stitched
to fit, and be held so easily in hand!
For what could the startled, confounded m er have done with the
Mephistopheles of Goethe P He would have shaken at its ower; and
haply, have transgressed under it, like a poodle itself scared and fright-
...} by Joy E's thunder and lightning. Now, poodle Mephistopheles, as
trained and taught by Mons. CARRf, was an animal not beyond the
powers of the master of the Princess's revels—a puppy-dog to be led
in a string, or carried under the arm, even as puppy-dogs are tethered
or borne by flunkeys.
“Driven behind the stove"—(raves Faust of the real poodle, Goethe's poodle)—
“it is swelling like an elephant; it fills the whole space; it is about to vanish into
mist. Rise not to the ceiling ! Down at thy master's feet! Thou seest I do not
threaten in vain; I will scorch thee with hºly fire. Wait not for the thrice-glowing
light. Wait not for the strongest of my spells.”
Now here are thunderbolt words, and scathing conjurations, that a
common manager, a merely simple Fºl. for a simple public, can
hardly be expected to confront and live through. And these things
are of Goethe's poodle: but the Frenchman teaches the dog to answer
to a very different sort of order: hence, when the poodle or Mephis-
topheles of the Princess's, enters upon his two legs, he runs in, with no
more of the devil in him than may be expected of the dullest of
footmen, with just enough of speech to be stupid upon any subject, and
on the very shortest notice. Never was poodle cut so bare—shorn so
close that the very skin has been nipped by the scissors, and still shows
the unsightly wounds—never was poor poodle so maltreated as
Goethe's tremendous black dog by the irreverent Frenchman. eWer-
theless, an easy critic has declared in favour of M. CARRíº's dog, as
it appears in the hands, or upon the arms of MR. CHARLEs KFAN, -
saying in justification of the clipping and exposure of the poodle, as
shown at the Princess's—
“One person, if he had now been living, would have decided on the wisdom of the
manager, who having an effective Easter piece in view, selected the low-art fabrica-
tion of M. MichEL CARRA in preference to the high-art creation of the German poet.
The person we mean is-Goethe himself."
Just as it might be said, “one person, when MR. CHARLEs KEAN
shall enter into Elysium, will at least step forward and embrace him
for his acting of SHAKSPERE, with every conceivable and inconceivable
scenic effect, and the person we mean, is—SHAKSPERE himself l’”
Even as GoFTHE might hug and thank MICHELCARRE for his “low:
art fabrication” (his low cutting of the jacket of the poodle), so will
SHAKSPERE embrace MR. CHARLEs KEAN for his fabrication with very
low cuttings of CIBBER's Richard the Third. Wonderful must be the
sources of gratitude in the Fields of the Blest !
The Faust and Marguerite—at the Princess's—shows MR. CHARLES
KEAN to be a born spectacle-maker. As WILLIAM PITT was said to
be a “heaven-descended minister,” so by a liberal stretch of compli-
ment, CHARLEs KEAN–as developed in his last wonder—may be con:
sidered a heaven-descended showman. Or if any of our readers should
think the terms too strong, they have only to reverse them, choosing
upward epithets from the opposite:
. Wonderful is the process by which all the poetry, all the grandeur,
is discharged from GQETHE, the imagination and subtleties of the
Master being supplied by the *...? of the machinist and the colours
of the scene-painter | Everything of life and beauty has been extracted,
and a caput mortuum — that is, CHARLEs KEAN's Mephistopheles—
remains.
And yet MR. KEAN never acted so naturally in all his life.
º down to the part; his perceptions of the P. trotting upon
our legs. He, no doubt, felt the triumph of common-place, and
rejoiced in his element. We have been accustomed to associate
with †† a devilish subtlety; a laughing spirit in the
eye, burning, like burning-glass, MR. KEAN, was more consonant
with his poodle-trimmer; he had no more subtlety in his speech than
the waiter at the Dog Tavern; nothing more scorching in his looks
than might flash from brass buttons. There was boldness, but no
urnlng.
Some of the scenic effects are very beautiful, and worthy of the
Princess's as a gallery of illustration. The vision of Marguerite—
(thanks to Marguerite herself!)—was very lovely; and the procession
to the Cathedral showed that the Manager had been a profound observer
of the condition and demeanour of people going to prayers. The sprink-
ºf of babies was very judicious and a little touching.

moral English º but when the soul of Marguerite in white muslin,

The morality of Marguerite—as painted (in rouge) º M. CARRſ:
—gives us rather Marguerite from the Palais Royal than Margue-
rite from the well. We would advise MR. KEAN to take a view of
the latter, so exquisitely painted by Miss Howitt. It may do him
good, as a royal and moral manager.
As a piece of show and mechanism (wires unseen). Faust and
Marguerite will draw the eyes of the town; especially the eyes that

THE LATEST IMPROVEMENT(*) IN GUARDS CAPS. WHAT
HORRORS ON HORRORS, HEAD.
THERE is a wretch in human form
(Would that his mortal course were run),
Who brooking indignation’s storm,
Has uttered this atrocious pun.
The caitiff who by chance had heard
The Census had been lately taken,
Seemed teeming with some thought absurd,
By which his sides were rudely shaken.
Then on a sudden out he burst
In utterance by laughter choked,
And made of puns the very worst
That ever common sense provoked.
'Twas this, Ha, ha, I understand,
The recent Census doth include
The population of the land,
The gentle, simple, mild, and rude.
But who the reason can explain
Under what singular pretences,
They have included the insane,
ho clearly are not in their Census.
WHAT IS THE SEAT OF WARP
We hear a great deal of the Seat of War, but we
think the expression is scarcely appropriate to the subject.
The nearest approach that we can conceive to a Seat of War
in the literal sense would be a Camp Stool. We sincerely
hope that when our troops arrive at the Seat of War, they
will think less of the Seat of War than of making a gallant
stand. Judging from a recent correspondence in the
Times, we jd be inclined to believe that as far as
the llth Hussars are concerned, the Seat, of War must
be the black leather used in seating their cherry-coloured
pantaloons.

TOUCHING MEMORIALS OF A PUBLIC FUNCTIONARY,
WHEN it was made known to Mr. Punch that Colonel, MABERLY
had ceased to preside over that vast establishment, “from whose
bourne. no money-letter e'er returns,” a gentle sorrow overcame the
great dispenser of mirth to nations. After musing for a while upon
the mutability of mundane things, and the accidents to which human
ſº is exposed, Mr. Punch took from his escritoire a quantity of
ighly interesting documents, some of which had been forwarded to
him by Colonel, MABERLY in reply to private inquiries, whilst others
had been collected by him during his rambles through the country. A
few excerpts from these choice papers, will show the public how
valuable the whole must be, and will perhaps induce somé antiquary
or virtuoso to offer more for them than the miserable twopence per
pound which Mr. Punch's butterman has had the audacity to propose
as the true equivalent for them.
Paper 59.-A, letter, written by Colonel, MABERLY, in reply to a
question from Mr. Punch as to the reason for the nondelivery of a
letter addressed to him at 85, Fleet Street, and containing £500, the
gift of a constant and enthusiastic reader. In concise terms the
Colonel informs Mr. Punch that the “proper officer” has been directed
to make the necessary inquiries. Letter dated 5th April, 1849.
Paper 82 is connected with the first-mentioned document, by a piece
of red tape, and by its subject matter, as it refers to the former
correspondence, facetiously, calls Mr. Punch's case, No. 89,579,685,
and informs him that the “proper officer” has failed to obtain any
reply whatever to the necessary inquiries. This paper, which is dated
19th December, 1852, further recommends Mr. Punch never to send
money through the fost Office, except in registered letters, or by
Money Orders. It is thus endorsed by Mr. Punch:-"Mem. To take
CoLoNEL MABERLY's advice.”
Papers. 89 and 163.-Two envelopes, in which Colonel MABERLY
had kindly enclosed letters, which he had been unable to deliver for
Mr. Punch. A condensed intimation of the urgent necessity which
had compelled CoLoREL MABERLY to deprive himself of the pleasure
of forwarding Mr. _Punch's letters is printed on the flap of each
envelope, thereby affording a striking proof of the immense quantity
of work i. in the Post Office, and of the scarcity of letter.
paper in that establishment.
aper 101,–A. Broad Sheet, addressed to the Postmaster of Pogis-
super-Mare, and informing him, that on and after the lst April, 1854,
the Major Money Order Offices of Chough-cum-Crow Parva, Smithville-
in-the-Marsh, and Upton Brownjonºs, must be treated as Minor Money
Order Offices, and that the Minor Money Order Office of Hurstrobinson
must, from the same date, be º a Major Money Order Office.
No reason is assigned either for the punishment or the reward, but as the
Postmaster of Pogis-super-Mare is ordered to place the Broad. Sheet
in his office window, Mr. Punch is inclined to hope that the disrated
towns have been reduced for their guilty, participation in case No.
89,579,685, and that the happy, Hurstrobinson has been rewarded
for occasionally delivering money letters. -
Paper 144.—In this document Colonel, MABERLY informs Mr. Punch
that LoRD MAIDstoNE has attempted to forward to Fleet Street a
copy of his poem, The Deluge, but that as his Lordship has transgressed
the regulations by making annotations in pencil on the leaves, to
direct Mr. Punch's attention to the fine, passages, the Post Qffice has
been compelled to detain the book, which, however, Mr. Punch can
receive on the payment of seven shillings and sixpence for *.
To this letter º r. Punch has addressed a suitable reply, begging
CoLonEL MABERLY not to trouble himself further about the book, but
to retain it as a mark of his, Mr. Punch's esteem. -
Before Mr. Punch consigns these, beautiful Memorials once more to
the gloom of his escritoire, he would remark, that Colonel, MABERLY
carries with him to his new office the hearty good will of many who
have found him a just and a kind master, May, MR. Row1AND HILL,
who succeeds to his honours, inherit his º also, and come to
be as much regretted at a future time by those over whom he is
appointed to preside.

NEEDLESS BARBARITY.

present civilisation, but with justice itself, that the unoffending soldier
should continue to be subjected to that of the stocks.

*LETTER FROM THE SEAT OF WAR.
PROM our Special Civil CoRRESPONDENT.
Constantinople, April 29th.
HE discretion you kindly
allowed me of selecting
my own head-quarters
for the purpose of ob-
serving the war now
raging, in Turkey, has
decided meon remaining
here, for several reasons.
I need hardly, say that
any consideration of my
own personal safety and
comfort had nothing to
do with the selection,
but I have felt most
deeply that it would be
eminently unjust to you
if I permitted any acci-
dent to prevent the
regular transmission of
my letters; and as, in
the neighbourhood of
conflict one never knows
what may, happen, I
have taken up my abode between two and three hundred miles from the
scene of action. Qf course, I consider that my right to exercise the
same discretion still exists, and should the Russians approach nearer
to the capital, I shall hold myself at liberty to retire ". Trieste, or
even to make Paris the basis of my operations. I hasten to give
you this assurance, so that you may have no apprehensions on your
own account.
You desire me to transmit to you accounts of the progress of the
war, and descriptions of its incidents. I have great pleasure in doing
so. This war, then, begun in consequence of the aggression of Russia
upon the Danubian Principalities, and of course the Sultan sent out his
armies to meet the invader. England and France have promised to
help Turkey, and are landing soldiers for that purpose. So much for
the state of the war. As regards its incidents, great bravery is shown
on both sides, and from what I have read, in history, of the character
of the belligerents, I have no doubt they will sustain the respective
honours of their countries. May a glorious war be speedily followed
by a lasting peace: - -
But it is right that, you should understand that information of this
recise and fº. character is not to be obtained without much self-
evotion and personal sacrifice. I do not complain of this necessity;
but it is only just to mention it. I have taken, apartments at one of
the two decent hotels in this city; and it may be interesting to your
readers to know that I pay twelve francs per diem for my accommoda-
tion. This includes a rusk and coffee before rising; a French break-
fast with various dishes, and wine, at eleven; any refreshment in the
way of lunch; and a table-d'hôte, at six. It also includes my bed.
But alas' for human happiness. This very day a series of misfortunes
has rendered me wretched, and made me incapable of writing to you
with my usual serenity. There is a mosque near my hotel, and the
man who stands in the minaret, and calls the people to prayers, has a
very bad cold, and, in consequence, I was awakened in the morning by
a most dissonant croaking, which is still in my ears. Next, one of the
mosquito curtains of j was torn at the top; and though I do not
know that any of the animals got in and bit me, still the thought of
having been exposed to such a chance does not conduce to equanimity.
The rusk of to-day was burned in the baking, and the coffee was spilt

desired lunch, the corkscrew was mislaid, and I had to go all the way

least a quarter of an hour late, and although I cannot, as a faithful
reporter, find fault with the cuisine, the soup, fish, and entrées being all
unexceptionable, the confectionary was very meagre, and a jelly, which
was near me, was literally opaque, instead of being transparent. Let
me add, that there is no § to my bed-room door, and I am compelled

THE CIRCULATION OF PUNCH.
SoME of our contemporaries are very busy in making comparative
tables of the relative circulation of certain periodicals from data
supplied by the publication of the returns of the Stamp Office. In
some cases there have been quarrels between obscure papers, about
which the public care nothing; but if one journal of small circulation
can º establish the fact that there are other journals with a circula-
tion still smaller, the result seems to be regarded as a triumph. The
following is the style of announcement that has been very prevalent of
late in some of the London and provincial newspapers:–
“IMPORTANT TO ADWERTISERS I
“We feel a proud satisfaction in calling the attention of the Advertising Public to
the exalted position occupied by the Independent, when compared with rival journals.
“Number of Stamps issued within the last Six Months to the following Newspapers
and Periodicals:—
The Pocklington County Independent . . 1,046
N.B. This is exclusive of Six Stamps spoiled in Printing.
The Manx Kitten . . - - . 1,025
The Old Pocklington Watchman 925
The Liberal Pocklingtonian Free Press - 426
The Suburban Post and Hyde Park Herald 114
“It will be seen from this official statement, that the Independent circulates con
siderably more than the average of the Kitten, and upwards often per cent. above the
Old Watchman, leaving the Free Press and the Post and Herald in a decided minority.
When it is remembered that the Independent circulates among all the old county
families, while the Kitten is only admitted to the humblest hearth, and the Watchman
can scarcely be said to be received within the portal of any fashionable abode, we need
scarcely say that the Independent is the best—indeed the only desirable medium-for
Advertisements.”
We have not taken the trouble to go into any calculations, as to the
relative circulation of Punch and other periodicals, for we hate arith-
metic, and indeed, we have no slate if we were even disposed to do a
sum. We therefore leave it to the curious in these matters to ascertain
how many times greater our circulation is than that of the Manx, or
any other literary Cat or Kitten that is desirous of coming up to the
scratch in the struggle for notoriety.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EASE BEFORE ELEGANCE.
PUNCH AMONG THE PAINTERS. No. 1.
To me, “in º: city pent,” May comes not more pleasantly in
the early green of the squares and parks, and the lilac blossom of the
suburban gardens, than in water-colours in Pall Mall, or in oil at
Trafalgar Square. And, next to Nature, what can Mr. Punch have
better than David Cox, or MARKANTHoNYP
Dear old David I feel as if you and I were shaking hands for a
long, long parting. Is it the heavy mist of fears in my eyes, or the
dimness of years in yours, that blurs those Welsh mountains and wild
Western moorlands, the last, I fear, that your glorious old hand-true
to the heart as ever, but now trembling—will create for the pleasure of
all that have ever looked Nature lovingly in the face? Alas! and is
Time drawing the veil between you º the looming hills, and gusty
skies? In brain and heart you see them still-bright and fresh as ever
-perhaps brighter and fresher! But the eye will, grºw glazed, and
the stiffening finger will flag, for all the minº's bidding; and the
inward º and glory will pass faintly and more faintly into shape
and colour, till what used to be noble, free, and generous transcripts of
earth, and sea, and sky, are now hazy and indistinct—landscapes of
Dream-land
All who have ever loved Nature, must love David Cox. How not
love the man who for fifty years has done liege suit and service to I
the solemn purple of far-off hills, the sudden gleam of golden corn-
fields, the stately march or wild glee of summer clouds, the tossing of
ºw-grass on the uplands, or the flush of heather belis along the
moor .
Well, let those who love him take their leave of him; for there hang
his last works in the room of the Old Water-Colour Society, ºf.
in their mellow indistinctness, but honestly beautiful to the end. He
leaves many good men behind, but no equal. There was in him that
intense sense of the solemnity, beauty, and variety of Nature, which
made every drawing of his fresh and gladdening, familiar as his hand
was to all of us, and much as he affected the same º and subjects
year after year. North Wales had his heart. He had absorbed its
colouring and contours into himself.
In one of Mr. Punch's country excursions—and where may not Mr.
Punch set up—that is, set down—his pavilion, and sound his roo-too-it?
—he came, after a successful pitch at Llanrwst, to the bridge at Bettws-
y-Coed (you will please to supply the vowels), and looking round him,
exclaimed to himself, “I know this country!” He did know it—in
DAVID Cox's drawings. For it was to this very spot—as Mr. Punch
found out in a confidential chat among the artists at “The Oak” that
night—the faithful old fellow had resorted year after º: loving the
F. like a mistress, wooing hill and field and river, till they laid their
earts bare to him, and told all they had to tell-every year something
}. and always worth the telling, and whispered to none but old
AVID.
So go, my dear young friends, reverently and tenderly, and give your
farewell and God-speed to David Cox, for he will draw no more. He
will divide the skirts of his weather-stained, wind-rent old mantle
º
among many, for whom the rags and tatters will make whole su
wherein they will array themselves very proudly, and make no sm
figure in May Exhibition-rooms.
MR. NAFTEL will have a large cantle, if he give us many such bits
of grey river-bed, and dank foss-side, as he shows this year.
Let MR. Lee, R.A., look at MR. NAFTEL’s water-rounded, moss-
greened stones, and learn what river-boulders are like, before he
next indulges in his short-handway of symbolizing slate and limestone,
gneiss and granite—at per square yard.
MR. BENNETT, too, deserves a respectable fragment, which, Iamsure,
dear old David would not begrudge him, could he see those bits of
furzy down and fermy woodland, reflections of out-of-door nature in
the compass of a twenty-two inch frame, so true, that to look at one is
like looking out of window on to a gravelly Kentish heath, or a lush
Surrey forest glade. And MR. McKewEN has earned a portion of
the honoured garment by that noble study of Windsor Oaks, though, in
the rest, he yet lacks perfect reverence for that mistress who taught old
David so much-Nature. -
Nor will I dely a lappet to GeoRGE FRIPP, in consideration of his
true service to river-bank and sea-side; and I will give a roll of the
wadding to Corley FIELDING, albeit he takes Nature's hand with his
gloves on, for the greeting, though a dainty and a gingerly one, is
honest and respectful.
But you, bright trickiness of T. M. RicuAnnº-deplorable
dexterity of Rowmotº standafar of not a rag of David's cloak
ſor . until you cast off the pride of the hand, and mortify the lust
of the pencil, and become like little children at the feet of Nature.
I wonder why bishops patronise the Water Colour Societies so
strenuously. I never go to either gallery but I am awestricken by the
apparition of a shovel hat and apron. Vagabond as I am, it makes me
uncomfortable; but I am pleased to see these high spiritual dignitaries
ſº what I can enjoy. Ifancy we must both be the better for it.
I don't remember ever to have metabishop at the Academy Exhibition.
I mention the Episcopate, because there is one, thing I must pro-
test against, and º wish the bishops would back me up in my re-
monstrance. I presume they belong to the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, and I know they do not, now, as a rul
encourage field sports (though I have heard of a prelate who is a º
judge of a horse, and can back, buy, or sell one, with MR. ANDERson's
elegant young man, or MR. ANDERson himself). I refer to the repre-
sentation of the sporting butchery perpetrated in a certain high quarter,
now so painfully prevalent. I cannot pass a print-shop, or lookinto an
exhibition room, }. there I see F.M. The PR—E ALB-T, very often
in company with her GR–s. M-J-Ty, surrounded by heaps of slain
beasts, birds, and fishes. His R-1, H–gh N-ss seems to proceed on
the continental principle of knocking down everything that gets up, for
his “bag” is always of the most miscellaneous description, includin
specimens of the whole game range, from red deer to snipe. ..It "...#
appear to be quite a toss-up, when he goes out to “stalk,” if he may
not bring home a dozen brace of grouse, half-a-score of black game, a
caper-cailzie, a pair of widgeon, and a mountain hare or so. I am glad
there are no wolves or wild boars in this country, as I am certain we
should have them too added to the slain, and I tremble at every new
outbreak in this sort lest I should find his R–L H-GH-ss has bagged
a badger, or—pudet dictu-afox!
Altogether, when I consider what º leads to—when
reckon up crops destroyed, leases, unreformed, hedge-rows kept
standing, farmers injured and irritated, poaching, with its attendant
drunkenness and pauperism, promoted, jails filled, limbs broken in
midnight scuffles, lives, lost in hot fight on the greensward, or in
miserable ignominy on the scaffold, I cannot but regret that one who
has striven so well and worthily for the improvement and culture of
º and neglected, should set such a Nº. example.
, HERM-J–ty (God bless her!), knows Mr. Punch's loyalty at all
times, and just now that loyalty burns with a hotter fire (if pºssible),
than usual. I am sure both She and His R-I, H--GH-ss will take
my hint in good part, and in future turn MR. HAAg's pencil, and SIR
Edwin’s brush to better account.

A SHOCKING KIND OF PUFF.
“MR. PUNCH, -
* A rostMAN's double rap was given at my street dºor, and
immediately my servant brought me a letter, on the back of which was
written the word “Electric Telegraph.” My nearest relations live on
a line of railway, whereby I once received a telegraphic communication,
apprising me of the death-seizure of one of the most near of them.
On taking up the letter endorsed as above, my first impression was
that some other one of them had been taken dangerously, ill, or ha
died suddenly. The consequence was a palpitation in the heart, and a
swimming in the head, and if the palpitation had been a little more
violent, there would have been a death to be telegraphed down that
same railway instead of up, and an undertaker would now be making
final arrangements respecting the writer of this. And as the envelope,
so alarmingly marked, turned out \o contain merely a handbill, ad-
vertising the sale of a lot of haberdashery, the coroner's inquest, which
would have been held on the body of that victim of puffing, might, in
justice, if not in law, have returned a verdict of manslaughter against
Messrs. Towzery, GANG, and Co., for causing the death of your
humble Servant, “A NERVous MAN.
“Suburbs Place, May, 1854.”
“P.S. Since the reception of the above startling notice, another has
been left here of the same sort. The practice of sending about these
dangerous puffs is becoming general. It will be nothing tº me now
that I am used to it; but will very likely kill somebody else.”
An Imperial Settler.
WHEN Nicholas alluded to Turkey as “un homme malade,'...he
meant to say, in wine-merchant's phrase, that ‘...the Porte was a little
sick,” in consequence of its having been so terribly shaken lately; and
that all it wanted was “settling”—kindly inferring that if he was only
allowed, he would very soon go in and settle it.

PITY THE POOR COPYING CLERKS.
Though we have not much respect for a certain class of writers who
are merely copyists, our º extends to those only who put forth
their copied writings under the false pretence of originality. The º
Copying Clerks are guilty of no such fraud, and we deeply sympathise,
therefore, with a gross piece of injustice, of which they have § been
made the victims. There is, as we all know, a zeal for Law Reform,
but there is a tendency in this as in many other matters, to begin the
reform at the wrong end, by cutting down the small pittance of those
who are ill paid, and leaving untouched, or even augmenting the in-
comes of those who are already paid more than sufficiently.
There existed formerly a body of men called Taxing Šutes. who
had long been taxing public patience to a fearful extent, and who had
also been taxing the pockets of the Suitors in Chancery to the amount
of several thousands per annum. In obedience to public opinion, the
intolerable nuisance was abolished in name, thqugh permitted to con-
tinue in fact; for though the officers were released from their duty,
the public º was not relieved from the necessity of paying their
salaries. measure of compensation was º, by which four
individuals have received considerably more than a quarter of a million
of money within the last eight or nine years; and as if the living in-
cubus on the public had not been sufficiently burdensome, the Chancery
Suitors are to be haunted for seven years after the death of the four
lacemen by their respective representatives. These official ghosts are,
owever, bent on no merely spiritual business, but they are to come
with open hands, demanding and carrying away more than ten thousand
a year º eir deadly clutches. -
It is enough to be taxed by living office-holders, but it is almost
unbearable to be called upon by salaried functionaries clamouring from
the grave for posthumous pay, and sweeping off their annual thou-
sands after all their own liabilities are discharged, and even the debt of
nature is satisfied. This mode of effecting a piece of Law Reform
contrasts rather violently with the mode in Whi the poor Copying
Clerks are treated, who are made to count any number of figures
representing pounds as one word, and a sum of £774,022,638 5s. 3d.
as three words, though to write them down would require probably
the ruling of three lines, and certainly very considerable care and
reference to the figures to prevent any mistake in transcribing
em.
This piece of ceonomy at the expense of a class already so ill-paid
that a “Copying Clerk’ is almost synonymous with ‘ half starved
drudge,” has been introduced by Lord St. LEONARDs, who seems to
have forgotten, that a copying machine- if human-requires food,
shelter, and clothing, to keep it in motion. The case of the unfortunate
Copyists has been properly taken up by the Legal Observer and the
Laio Times, but these being class papers, they can produce only a
partial effect; and it has struck forcibly on the bump of benevolence
of Punch that he ought to make known to the world at large, the
wrongs of the º Clerks, and thus invite towards them universal
sympathy. It is but sorry Law Reform which pampers with a very
plethora of compensation, both º and posthumous, the holder of
an overpaid office, continuing his profits to him as it were in the
grave, by the hands of his representatives; and at the same time sends
perhaps º to join him, through starvation, the overworke
Copying Clerk, with or without his ill-fed wife or one or more of his
attenuated children.
As Lord St. LEONARDs shows a kind interest in soldiers' wives
and families, we are sure we have only to bring ſunder his notice the
effects of his order—which was no doubt well-intentioned, but ill-
considered on his part—to cause him to set to work to obtain the
rescinding of a regulation which it is feared will reduce to starvation:
point a body of men who have always been rather too near that very
unenviable position on the social foodometer.
IMPORTANT EXPLANATIONS.
IN Friday’s Debate on the Navy Estimates CAPTAIN ScobelL (who
usually talks sensibly enough) brought up two matters of complaint
One was that in an official despatch, a steamboat, had been twice, re-
ferred to as “he.” and the other was, that, MR. STAFFORD, late
º to the Admiralty, had used the word “it,” when speaking of
a Wessel.
Mr. Punch is requested by SIR JAMES GRAHAM to explain that the
male º was properly applicd to the steamboat in question, that
boat having been a screw, which a female, of course, never is, an
MR. STAFFORD º it may be added that, when he used the word “it,”
he was speaking of a neutral vessel.

THE ABOLITION MANIA.
It is one of the minor evils of a gross abuse, that all sorts of
ludicrous attempts are constantly being made to abolish it. Every-
body admits that the abuse ought to be got rid of, but nobody can
help laughing at the lame and impotent measures that are taken to
bring about the desired conclusion. It has long been a settled thing
that the Ecclesiastical Courts are a nuisance that must be swept away;
but we never can suppress a smile when we pass a certain zinc plate
cm a certain door-post, not very far from our own abode, inscribed
with the magnificent words, Society for the Abolition of the Eccle-
siastical Courts. The “Society” seems to occupy a floor, or the
portion of a floor, and we cannot help contrasting the insignificance of
the rºmises with the grandeur of the conclusion which the Society
alms af.
As there are several other equally ambitious Associations that are
just as, ill-lodged as the one we have named, we would propose that
they all unite their means for the purpose of taking one good house, in
which the various Abolition Societies should have separate apartments
--or, at all events, separate brass plates-assigned to them. There are
Societies for the Abolition of a state Church for Reform of the Law,
ſor getting rid of the Court of Chancery, and a variety of other more
or less useful purposes. Should the house become inconveniently
crowded, it would be easy, by a proper arrangement as to the knocker
and the bells, to keep the Societies distinct from each other.
For example, we would have on the door-post such notices as the
following:—
For the Abolition of the Ecclesiastical Courts, ring the top bell.
For the Anti-State, Church Association, and for getting rid of the
Bishops, give a single knock.
For the Reform of the Peerage, pull the lower bell twice, and walk
down the steps of the area.
For the United Brotherhood and Social Community for the Division
of Everything, knock and ring, and walk right up stairs to the top of
the house, when the door is opened by a check string.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUSEYISM HAVING ITS FLING.
T first, we could not altogether
understand the meaning
of the subjoined para:
graph, which appeared
one day last week in the
Morning Chronicle:–
“St. PAUL's, KNIGHTs-
BRIDGE. – We understand
that the scrutiny of the votes
for the election of a church-
warden, has resulted in a
majority for MR. DAvidson,
and legal steps will be taken
to prevent MR. WESTERTox
from exercising the office.
At an influential meeting of
the parishioners, held on
Saturday, it was unanimously
resolved to spare no expense
in defending the services as
at present conducted at St.
Paul's, from whatever quarter
they may be assailed, and a
defence committee of noble-
men and gentlemen was
formed for that purpose.”
What was intended
by the resolution “to
spare no expense in defending the services,” &c., “from whatever
quarter they may be assailed,” puzzled us entirely, until some light
was thrown upon the subject by a police case which subsequently
appeared in the Times, stating that at
“WEstMINstER.—The Rev. CHARLEs F. Lowder, one of the curates at St. Bar-
nabas Church, Pimlico, described as of St. Barnabas College, appeared to a summons,
charging him with assaulting John Ledwich.”
The case against this reverend gent. was thus stated by the attorney
for the plaintiff:-
“There was in the district of St. Paul and St. Barnabas an election on Easter
Tuesday for the office of Churchwarden. It was not necessary to mention, as important
to the charge with which the magistrate had to deal, the particular character of that
contest, but there were two candidates for the office, the cause of one of whom was
espoused by the defendant, while the complainant was a man employed to carry a
board by a committee seeking to procure the return of the other candidate. The
complainant was carrying his board in Ebury Street on the day in question when he
was astounded at finding himself suddenly attacked by a number of lads throwing eggs
and stones at him. The circumstance became the subject of inquiry by the committee,
when, to their surprise, it was assertained that the eggs were furnished to the persons
throwing them by the defendant, and that they were incited by him to commit the
assault which was the subject of the present charge.” -
Thus one of the expenses not spared in defending the services in
question was the expense of providing eggs, probably rotten, wherewith
to pelt the placard-bearer of the un-Romanesque churchwarden. In
this manner are those services defended when assailed from the quarter
of a man employed by the opposite party to carry a board. Puseyism
carries on its own little war in the j. of SS. PAUL and BARNABAs
by egg-shelling its adversaries, who ought to be thankful that it has
no other means of shelling to bombard them with. But as straws
thrown up show which way the wind blows, so eggs and stones flung
at a man's head from the instigation of a Puseyite curate, indicate the
animus of Tractarianism.
Lest that clergyman should be imagined to have been the victim of
ºration, a few more lines must be extracted from the police
report:—
“After the information received by the committee, the churchwardens waited upon
the defendant, as they could not possibly believe that he had so far forgotten himself,
when he made a direct admission of the act imputed to him, stating that it had been done
in a moment of indiscretion and want of reflection. This admission was followed by a
letter from defendant repeating it, and acknowledging that he had incited the boys

reparation to the person who had carried them.”
So the battle of Puseyism is fought by the choristers or acolytes of
St. BARNABAs under the leadership of their priest. That ecclesiastic,
we are glad to see, apologised and offered to make reparation for the
egg-throwing: so did some lay gentlemen some time ago concerned in
a similar outrage at Epsom. The apology was accepted; evidence
withheld, and reparation was made by the reverend defendant to the
amount of two pounds. . The magistrate was thus happily enabled,
with a good grace, to avoid the scandal of sending him to the House of
Correction: an institution in which Tractarianism will one day involve

We are told (and the conduct of the EMPEROR Nicholas has since
confirmed it) that the “Prince of Darkness was a gentleman.”. We
are indifferent about the Prince, but we should say that “the Picture

A HINT TO MR. MITCHEL.
WE see that the vitriolic MR. MITCHEL has been writing one of his
- - years
of age ; ” whom he insults by addressing to them the following
nonsense :-
“I believe it is safe enough to assume that in the war now imminent, England being
†: * side and Russia at another, all your sympathies, my countrymen, are with
ussia.
The assumption may be safe enough. It may not–MR. MITCHEI.
being where he is—jeopardise MR. MITCHEL’s neck-or nose. But
MR. MitchEL has a reason for his assumption, so that what he pro-
. to assume, he really infers. According to the MITCHELLAN
ogic-
“The sole reason and ground of this is, of course, that Russia is the enemy of
England.”
Therefore are the sympathies of MR. MitchEL's countrymen-thinks
MR. MITCHEL–with Russia—Siberia, of course, notwithstanding.
It is likely that the sympathies of MR. MITchEL himself are really
with Russia. As he approves of the flagellation of slaves, so he may
perhaps admire government by the knout. Did he live under such a
régime he would probably accommodate himself to it in respect of his
speech and writing. The laceration of human flesh . the stripes of
the hangman would probably form in itself a pleasing object of contem-
plation to MR. MitchEL–he being personally º: There is
something in the gratuitous malignity which he has always evinced,
that renders it possible that MITCHEL of the Vitriol-Squirt delights in
gloating over the idea, and would still more keenly enjoy the reality, of
human agony. - -
Perhaps MR. MITCHEL had better take care what he writes. He is
now in a land of liberty; yes: but a land of liberty for public indig-
mation as well as for private malice. He may express rather too muc
sympathy for despots; he may give the American people a little
more atrocious, nonsense, than t †. will stand. Peradventure he will
carry his fanatical hatred to England rather too far in attempting to
i. Irish rows in aid of Russian barbarism. We know what end
the fanaticism of MR. Joseph SMITH led to: and MR. John MitchEL
should consider that he has an office which may be burnt about his ears,
a back that may be scored with a cow-hide, and a skin which may be
tarred and feathered.
PARLIAMENT AND THE PRESS.
A few members of Parliament who seem to have an instinctive
horror of all “intelligence,” have been attempting a crusade against
the press, which in their legislative wisdom, they think, knows a great
deal more than it ought to know, and learns with a quickness which
appears quite awful to those with whom slowness of apprehension
would find sympathy. The other day a notice stood on the pºper of
the Lower House for a question to be put to the Government “as to
the circumstances under which the Times reporter obtained his passage
to Gallipoli.” It would be scarcely more absurd and impertinent to
ask in the House of Commons, for an explanation of “the circum-
stances under which the Bow Street police reporter obtained the means
of riding outside an omnibus from the corner of Catherine Street to
the corner of Bridge Street, Blackfriars.” Some honourable members
appear to be very indignant at the early and accurate intelligence of
the press, and are disposed to argue with great indignation “what right
a newspaper reporter has to go anywhere as i. as anybody else, or
to know anything that has not already reached official ears,” the appre-
hensive qualities of which are not always equal to their longitude.
A recent notion seems to be, that nothing, less than a Lord Qught
to be permitted the facilities of rapid locomotion on board º: taken
up for Government purposes. e recommend the Lords, for their
own dignity, not to press this point too far, lest the aristocratic body
should º, by the necessity that would arise for selecting from
among “their łoś. ” the re reporters of the newspapers.
When a nobleman is wanted there is no doubt he can be had, for it is
only recently that an Earl was quite accessible as a writer of testi-
monials in favour of a quack medicine. We should be sorry to hear
in the House of Lords any allusion to “the noble penny-a-liner on, my
right,”, but if the newspapers should be driven tº dispense with their
unprivileged reporters, we have no doubt that titled correspondents
would soon be in the pay of the newspapers.

DEBATE ON THE EMPEROR'S CUP.
(Specially reported.)
House of CoMMONs. Tuesday, May 2.
THE House was about to adjourn, when - -
LQRD CLAUDE HAMILTON begged leave to call attention to a subject
which had occasioned much pain to himself and other honourable
members. (“Hear!” from MR. CopDEN.) He had read in some of
the newspapers a statement, that it had been determined that the Cup
so munificently presented, as one of the Ascot Race prizes, by the
EMPEROR of Russia, should not be accepted this year. He wished
to ask the Government whether they had any official information on
the subject.
LoRD PALMERston said that he believed the statement alluded to
by the noble lord to be correct; and, would add, that, he quite
approved of the decision of those who had the direction of the matter.
ut he did not think that the noble lord ought to feel uncomfortable.
(Laughter.). He only inferred the noble lord's discomfort from the
curious wriggling gestures with which he addressed the House.
(Renewed laughter.) No slight could be intended to the noble lord's
friend, the Czar; for instead of our having a race for one of his cups
only, a British heet was just then running for his whole service of
plate, and anything else they might find at St. Petersburg. (Loud
cheers and laughter.
MR. BRIGHT said that the noble lord had, as usual, made an effective
use of claptrap, but he (MR. BRIGHT) saw nothing to laugh at. He
was one of those who did not take a violent interest in horse-racing;
but he liked consistency. A foreign potentate, with whom we were
engaged in an unnecessary war—(Hear, hear!)—yes, he understood
that cheer. Well then, a necessary war, a war rendered necessary by
reckless politicians and an incendi ress. Would that suit them?
Well, this potentate was charged with faithlessness. At any rate, he
ad shown faith in this matter; for, * romised a cup, he had
not withdrawn his promise, in spite of the declaration of war, and the
Russian Consul had instructed a celebrated artist to prepare the article
as usual. But they, forsooth, were to sulk like schoolboys, and refuse
a piece of silver worth several hundred pounds, just because we had
foolishly quarrelled with the man who offered it. But it was all of A
pleCe. -
SIR JAMES GRAHAM suggested that on the contrary, it was all of a
war. (Laughter.) But he would venture to remind the hon. member
for Manchester that in the words of SHAKESPEARE-
“To the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.'
The MARQUIs of GRANDY said that this was another scandalous
insult to the EMPEROR of Russia, who was treated most cruelly.
Why, let them argue the matter lº. in the way he (Lord
GRANBY) always tried to do. . What was the object of horse-racing P
Why, to improve our breed of horses; and horses they all knew were
used in war. Well, nevertheless, the Emperor continued to patronise
our races, though they were to improve horses that might be used
against him. Was that the act of an enemy? (Hear, hear!)
LoRD John Russell admitted that the question was one upon
which the House might fairly be called to §: an opinion. He did
not find any reference to horse-racing in Magna Charta; but races
used to be run at York in 1607; and CHARLEs THE SEcond, usually
known as the Merry Monarch, gave a cup of the value of one hundred
guineas. The act for suppressing races with ponies and weak horses
Was d in 1739, after which, plates were i. in several places,
and the breed of horses improved, until brought to perfection in the
case of FLYING CHILDERs, who at Newmarket ran three miles six
furlongs and ninety three yards, in six minutes and forty seconds. The
great LoRD SoMERs had not turned his attention to the subject, and
perhaps as regarded MR. Fox, in connection with horse-racing, the less
said the better. (Hear, hear!) He owned that he thought the House
ought to have more information, on the question, and he should not
oº: to the appointment of a Select Committee. -
R. Cobden said that his only claim to be heard on Racing was that
he was member for the west Riding. (Laughter.) A man had once
been hanged for refusing his liquor, and perhaps we might come to no
od by refusing this cup. (Hear, hear.) As to pretending to feelin
in the matter, that was trash. It was, according to the advocates o
war, lawful to plunder the enemy. Mind, he (MR. CoRDEN) did not
say so, believing that all plunder, except the legitimate gains of trade,
was unlawful, nor was Russia our enemy. But if it were right, surely

and logically to rob the Czar of the price of this cup, say three hundred
guineas or whatever it might be, was clearly a sensible act. Why, if a
soldier cost fifty pounds (as had been stated by the Secretary at War)
by taking this silver you impoverished the Czar by six soldiers, and
some shillings over. (Hear, hear.)
MR. Dishaeli had not intended to speak on this subject, indeed he
was in the habit of never intending to speak on any subject on which
he found himself addressing the House; but he felt that it would be
disrespectful to HER MAJESTY, who was accustomed, in the enjoyment
of her usual gracious and º recreation, to visit Ascot, were one
who had been honoured with office under the Crown not to offer a few
remarks on this occasion. The conduct of HER MAJEsty's Ministers
was as mean, shuffling, and disgraceful as usual. The noble Lord, the
Home Secretary, had, in turf language, cut out the running, but with
something less than his usual happiness, while the Right Honourable
Baronet had been a bad second, and the Noble Lord the Member for
London had been literally nowhere. (Laughter.) The cup was to be
referred to a committee. He thought the committee had º, Con-
sider it in their cups. (Murmurs.) Oh, you don't like that Very well.
Then I am compelled to read—I had not intended to do it—thirteen
or fourteen speeches of the Noble Lord's, delivered in 1819, 1820, and
subsequent years. The Right Honourable Gentleman began to pile
volumes of HANSARD on the table, when, in answer to a piteous look
from the Speaker,
MR, BERNAL,0sºon NE rose to order. There was no question
formally before the House.
The SPEAKER said, he knew that, but had feared that if he stopped
the debate, Hon. Members might think he wanted to get away to
some party. That thought often prevented his cutting short most
unprofitable discussions.
MR. BROTHERTON hoped that the Right Hon. Gentleman would
bave no such delicacy in future. He begged to move the adjournment
of the House.
LoRD CLAUDE HAMILTON protested against the subject being thus
burked. The Emperor was a very kind man, and gave a very nice
cup, and Ascot was a very pleasant place, and on the evening of the
cup day he (Lord CLAUDE HAMILTON), always went to a delightful
dance. |

endeavour to put out

and ELLIots’ entire.
While giving credit to the
Rººf water drinkers
for their hatred of a gross
abuse, we cannot admire the very gross abuse which some of them
shower on those who indulge in the use , f alcohol. We hardly
know which spirit we ought to visit with stermer condemnation, the
intoxicating spirit of the gin shop, or the very, unchristian. Spirit in
which some of the tºti orators pour forth their denunciations of
intemperance. According to the REv. W. LANDELs, every dealer in
any intoxicating drink “is a promoter, supporter, and distributor of
curses and dammation.” In the reverénd gentleman's charitable view
of the case every publican is a fearful sinner, who, to quote the words
are the locusts of society, licensed banditti; ” and,indeed, such scourges
to humanity that the Rev. W. LANDELs is described in the report as
expressing the amiable and ultra pious wish “that GQP in his mercy
S.
We should like to hear a definition of temperance by a clergyman,
who, while preaching up the virtue of temperance, prºphesies speedy
“damnation” to the whole of the beer, and spirit dealers, and
suggests that they will all “go down to hell” in a rather expeditious
Inanner.
The Reverend Gentleman appears to forget that there are man
kinds of intemperance, and not the least disgusting sort is that whic
blurts forth upon others a stream of fierce and fiery trash, which is
poisonous to the reputation over which it is poured, and is, in fact, a
species of moral alcohol or vituperative vitriol, thrown recklessly
about to the damage and destruction of the character of a whole class
of the community. Ardent Spirits are objectionable enough, and neat
brandy, rum, or gin, may be called, literally, an unmixed evil; but we
doubt if any spirit can be much wore than the spirit in which the
REVEREND W. LANDELs has attacked those who are engaged in the
sale or consumption of intoxicating liquors.
CAPITAL EXAMPLE FOR THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
WE understand that Vauxhall Gardens, if ever . en, again, are
to be closed every night at twelve o'clock. Now we think this example
might be followed with great advantage by the House of Commons.
Surely the hour that is considered quite late enough for pleasure, ought
be considered equally late for business. The law that *. to
ham-sandwiches ought to cut with equal keenness against the argu-
ments that rival them in thinness. We make MR. BROTHERTON a
present of our argument, and we hope he will use it with effect in
getting a law passed, that no parliamentary fireworks be let off after
eleven o’clock, and that as the clock strikes twelve, all the ten thousand
additional lamps of oratory be, every one of them, blown out. Any
Member found loitering about the House after midnight, to be locked
up until the housemaid comes in for the Petitions and the other waste-

SPLENDOUR AND ECONOMY.
It is possible to live on any scale of grandeur
§ the expedient of never paying anybody, but
this system cannot be pursued for a long time.
In order to unite magnificence of living with
moderation of expenditure, the best plan is to
pay your tradesmen, when you are obliged, but
never till then, with the exception of settling
a bill voluntarily now and then for the purpose
of maintaining your credit. Otherwise, make
your tradespeople wait as long as you possibly
can: and when a tradesman will wait no longer,
pay him. Pay him at once. Don't let him sue
you, in the County Court or elsewhere,
that will increase your expenses. Pay him, and
immediately employ somebody else, with whom
commence the same method of dealing over
again. In this way it will be possible for you
to live many years at a rate very much exceedin
your income, and to keep up a highly gente
appearance with a little money, if you are rogue
enough to practise such a species of swindling.
Gas-trick Symptoms.
ALI, the gas-lights in the House of lords went
suddenly out during a debate last week, but Loºp
REDEspale, who was speaking, “proceeded with
his address as if nothing had occurred.” Mr.
Punch, on reading the debate of that night (it
consisted of noble notions as to the income-tax) is
rude enough to think that several other speakers
besides Lord REDESDALE talked in the dark.
USEFUL KNOWLEDGE AT OXFORD.
THE Oxford “University Intelligence,” the other day, exhibited a
wonderful advance of intelligence on the part of the University. It
announced that
“The Reader in Experimental Philosophy (Mr. WALKER) will commence a course
of lectures on Franklinic and Voltaic Electricity, at the Clarendon, on Monday,
May 8th, at 1 o'clock.”
The parenthesis in the foregoing statement is not meant to indicate
that * is a hoax. Under the same head we find this further announce-
ment :-
“The Professor of Botany (DR. DAUBENEy) will lecture during this and the suc-
. ºrm on Wegetable Physiology, and on some of the principal natural families
In these plants clearly no deception is intended; they may be under-
stood to mean bond ſide productions of the vegetable kingdom. The
following concludes the list of notices:—
“The Laboratory at the Ashmolean Museum will be open on Monday, May 8th, for
instruction in Chemical Analysis and Experimental Chemistry. º: Laboratory
hours will be from 10 A.M. till 5 P.M. daily, Saturdays excepted. Should a sufficient
class be formed for the purpose, MR. M.AskELYNE purposes to give a course of lectures
on Chemical Analysis, at 2 o'clock on three days of the week.”
Experiments are actually to be tried at Oxford. The University
will not stand upon the old ways any more. At least it will try if the
new are not better in Chemistry. Perhaps MR. MAskELYNE will
succeed in convincing the “Heads of Houses” that there are more
than four elementary substances, and DR. DAUBENEY will manage to
persuade the Hebdomadal Board that there are roots in the earth, and
out of it, of nearly as much consequence as those of the Greek and
Hebrew languages. MR. WALKBR may make them understand that
FRANKLIN was almost as clever a fellow as PROMETHEUs; and let us
hope that the University, under the influence of his Voltaic Electricity,
will prove itself to be something better than a galvanised corpse.

WE, learn from an American paper that DR. HARRIET HUNT has
been lecturing at New York on “Woman as a Physician.” DR,

Wise Men at Blows.
The Proverb expressly says, “De gustibus non est disputandun.”
However, the ventilation of the House of Commons gives a decided
blow to the truth of this proverb, for ever since the House was built,
our architects and chemists and scientific men have been disputing
about nothing else than, “de gustibus; ” and they are even squabbling
now, with the gusts still blowing about each other's ears. Their own
breezes would matter but little, but the poor unfortunate members
come in for all the side-blows.
LA COSAGUAISE.
THE French army has a new song, very popular, at present, amongst
the titis and the toulourous, called “Cear iraz Czar ira !”. Politeness,
due even to an enemy, forbids us mentioning where, it is said, the
Czar will go to.

THEATRICAL RELIGION.
A Billet-Doua from a Young Lady in Belgravia to the LoRD Bishop of LONDON, touching 3
the Puseyite Performances at St. Paul's, Knightsbridge.
“My DEAR DUCK OF A Bishop,
“I Hope you won’t be so cruel as to alter the performances at St. Paul's. I will
never forgive you if you do. They are so delightful, you can’t tell. I can assure you it is
as good as É. to the play: in fact better, for all thé plays are closed on the Sunday-but
here the Church is open all day, and one can go in without paying anything at the doors.
It’s so delightful, you have no idea!
“If you close Ší Fauſs, there isn't a place in London half so amusing where we can go to.
If Yº do, I declare I will call you a monster, that I will.
‘The singing is so delightful. The intoning is so much better than the drawling, sleepy,
good-for-nothing, abominable, hum-drum way in which most clergymen read the prayers. It’s
quite charming. MR. LIDDELL’s voice, too, is the best I ever heard for a clergyman. The
jº. notes are as sweet, as MARIO's—whilst his lower ones remind one not unfavourably
of ForMes in Der Freischütz. He charms you one minute, and frightens you the next.
will tell you, my dear º what is the only thing I can compare his singing to. You have
been in a Montagne Russe, of course?—I mean the Montagnes Russes that used to be exhibited
at Tivoli years i. at Paris, and were so fashionable. Well, MR. LIDDELL’s intonation is
exactly like a celestial Montagne Russe—you keep rising and falling all the while—at one
moment being lifted up to the skies, and the next º: into rude contact with the world.
It's like being in a swing, merely to think of it.
“As for the flowers, if º could be spread all over the church, until it looked like a
Florigultural Show, I should like it all the better. Indeed, if a bouquet could be given to
each lady as at a weddin }. I should not object. Flowers, cannot hurt anybody, and for
my mind I think if Mr. LIDDELL, was in the habit of preaching with a white camellia, or
with a rose japonica, in his button-hole, that his discourse would probably be all the sweeter
for it, and in the absence of real flowers, surely artificial flowers are better than none P
“Then persons complain of the processions: I have no patience with such stupid people.
To my y of thinking, there are not processions half enough. They make certain ceremonies
pretty and effective, which without them would pass unnoticed., I do not mind telling you
in confidence that if a. little dancing was also introduced, the effect would be the
greater. For instance, if a number of young ladies in white muslin were to run before the
gurate, and sprinkle flowers on his pat before ascending into the pulpit, how very charming
it would beſt wouldn't it?
... “As for the bowing and the like, I do not see why because persons are inside a Church
it should prevent them being polite. Is it any excuse for being rude because you are in a
pew - and if I meet my dearest, and best beloved friend LADY ANNA Louisa in the
chancel, or one of the aisles, is that a reason why I should cut her? I am sure, my dear
Bishop, from what I have always heard of your great kindness of heart and sweet urbanity of
manner, that you are too much of a gentleman ever to propose such a monstrous state of

“Therefore, mon cher Bishop, do not take from us our bowings and our processions; do
not attempt to pluck away from our pretty altars one of the handsome vases that at present
decorate it; pray leave us in the undisturbed enjoyment of our flowers, and allow us to sing

are not in the tiniest bit theatrical—on the con-
trary, they are not half theatrical enough. Only
let us perform the service according to our
manner of thinking, and I will engage that there
shall be as great a rush of carriages outside as on
any night when SoPHIE CRUVELLI is singing. If
I had my way, not a seat should be let for less
money than the price of a stall at Drury Lane.
Why not have ivory crosses for St. Paul's in the

WHOLESOME TRUTHS ABOUT UNWHOLESOME
SHAMS.
Hilosophers tell us
that the term “Barley
Sugar” is a corruption
of “sucre brulé,” burnt
sugar, and, if we may
trust the statements of
the Analytical Com-
mission in the Lance:
of the 18th March and
the 15th April, this
opinion is fully borne
PUFFING AND PIETY.
THE following advertisement, cut out of a country paper, has filled
us with a compound mixture, in which disgust and contempt are the
chief ingredients:-
To WESLEYANS AND others.
HOSE Persons who wish to BENEFIT the FUNDS of the BRISTOL
ROAD-CHAPEL and SCHOOLS, and who may need the aid of a Dentist, may
do so by calling upon MR, SELVEY, Sungeon DENT1st, 109, Great Charles Street.

month of May, to give one-half the amount * from any one case that may come
under his notice, or several cases, to the amount of Twenty Pounds. MR. S. strictly

out by modern barley
sugar, the greater por-
tion of which ought to
be burnt with the least
ossible delay. Punch
aving learnt, with
alarm and horror, the
character of the messes
which, under the name
of comfits, he has so
often ". to his
beloved offspring, now
solemnly devotes him-
self to the discomfiture
of all those unprincipled
sugar-bakers, who seem
really to out - Herod
HERod in their hostility
to infants. And first
he would warn his
young friends against
some “thick pieces of sugar confectionery, about two inches long and
three inches thick, and about half an ounce in weight.” They are
termed. “Ginger, Palates,” but, as , they are coloured throughout
of an intense yellow, with a mineral pigment (chromate of lead) in
an absolutely poisonous quantity, it is clear that Palates is a misprint
for “Palettes,” and that the “ingenuous youth of nations” might
with as much propriety devour the contents of a paint-box.
Here also it must be stated, that the lively hue of the ginger lozenge,
which so many of Mr. Punch's friends ascribe to the presence of an
unusual quantity of . is due solely to the before-mentioned
igment. The ginger lozenges of only one vendor, MR. HEARN, of 56,
ottenham Court Road, have been found genuine, and Mr. Punch,
penetrated with the profoundest respect for this eminent man, gra-
ciously appoints him his Sugar Baker, and informs him that Judy also
will look upon him as HEARN.
If those who are warned by Mr. Punch against the lozenges should
turn to the various rocks as they are called, they will only be flying
from Scylla to Charybdis; for the Albert rock, Yellow rock, and others
(which, as they are made of burnt sugar, may be called igneous rocks),
are as dangerous as the Symplegades or the Acroceraunſe, as indi.
estible as horneblende, and more nasty than gneiss. The mothers of
- º may be certain that they will infallibly injure their children,
if they allow them to be thus “rocked in their cradles by the deep”
and designing vendors of poisoned sweets. The various abominations
sold under the names of “Scotch mixture,” “Kiss me now,” “S
buttons,” and “coloured shapes,” (which last are more º:
shapes than any the poet ever dreamed of) differ only in appearance,
but are wonderfully alike in their powers of doing mischief.
. And here Mr. Punch must remark that the Analytical Commissioners
in speaking of the various pigments employed to colour these wretched
preparations, have omitted to point out an analogy between the
articles, and the purchasers. They say, “the simple greens are verdi-
º which contains copper and SchEELE's green, which contains
oth arsenic and copper.” who does not see that these simple greens
are well suited to the other not less simple greens who possess copper
and spend it on such trash?
Nor must it be º that the colour alone is at fault, or that
the mischief is only skin deep. Much of that which appears to be
sugar is flour, or at least something which the millers have called flour,
but into the composition of which alum and bone-dust enter largely.
Pººh could, however, forgive the introduction of that which the
children must eat in the form of bread if they do not get it in their
comfits, but he does not think that gypsum, chalk, plaster of Paris
pipe-clay, potters' clay, and Cornish clay were intended to form part of
our diet. He has heard that lichens can exist and support life com-
fortably on such substances, but he must say that his likings are quite
opposed to the introduction of such articles of food, and he gives the
ers and vendors of this poisonous rubbish notice, that if they offer
to crºm, the three abºve named clays down the throats of his little
friends, he will speedily exterminate them without mercy.
This is certainly a novelty in the puffing business, and appeals through
the hollow tooth, as well as the empty head, to the pocket of real
or affected piety. The advertiser undertakes to give to a religious and
educational object one half of all he can get to the amount of twenty
pounds, by pulling out, plugging up, or otherwise dealing with the
|decayed teeth of all those who like to mix up a little good or imaginary
goºd with their own evils., We cannot say how far the arrangement
will benefit the Chapel and Schools, but it will certainly pay the Wes.
leyan Dentist very well if it gets him all the cases which he evidently
has set his heart upon. -
| We can but hope that the religious dodge will not be encouraged
among advertisers, for if it succeeds in one instance, we shall have all
the quacks in England º a pious flavour to their nostrums and
their testimonials. It is bad enough to see a large number of the
Peerage, and a good per-cen of the Bench of Bishops quoted daily
as high authorities for the painless extraction of corns; but if the pious
element is to become a permanent portion of the daily puff, we fear
that we may be often exposed to much additional nausea.

A CLERICAL LUBBER'S HOLE.
ANOTHER Irish grievance—a truly Irish one—has been ventilated.
Several of the Pope's Brigade, have been pertinaciously repeating a
question to the First Lord of the Admiralty, as to whether the Papist
sailors in the fleet are compelled to attend Protestant worship on
Sundays. SIR JAMEs has, ever so many times, assured the querists
that no such hideous and torturing tyranny is practised, but MR.LUGAs,
on Friday, with the double ingenuity of his Quakeropapistical training,
discovered a new way of putting the matter. He abused SIR JAMEs
GRAHAM for having said that the Roman Catholic sailors had made no
complaint on the subject; and
º; that an Irish priest at Portsmouth had been so frightfully
afflicted at this soul-destroying persecution, that he had threatened to
walk all over Ireland persuading the people not to enlist.
SIR JAMEs once more explained that the rule in the navy is that
service shall be performed, and that every seaman shall be “per-
mitted” to attend—that there is no compulsion, and that if Popish
JACK likes to chew his tobacco below, while Protestant BILL is staring
at the Chaplain on deck, he has a perfect right to do so, and the two
theologians can compare notes afterwards. And the First Lord
repeated that no complaint had been made by officers or men,
seeing that there was nothing to complain of, but that he had received
º: that they had complained by la
remonstrances from a couple of priests, who had not, however, the
impudence, mirabile dictu, to say that they were employed by the
aggrieved parties. So eager are these mischievous priests to manufac.
ture a grievance, that they do not fear to risk such a ridiculous
blunder as this, though it must be exposed as soon as committed. As
for Priest KELLY, who threatened to commit treason, MR. LUCAs ex-
plained that he had not carried his threat into execution. If he had,
averse as everybody is to inflicting severe punishment on a fool
however dangerous—it would have been a case in which Mr. Punc
would have liked to see the extreme penalty commuted for as sound
a flogging as the brawniest boatswain in the maligned service could
y on. Persecute JACK for his religion! Punch's dear eyes! his
lee-scuppers are running over at the thought, and he really insists upon
that being stowed, and upon splicing the mainbrace, to the confusion
of the Brigade.
Unexpected Fairness.
IN the debate on the Oxford Reform Bill, MR. Heywoop moved
that the statutes of the new legislature at Oxford should be framed in
the English language. But the House rejected the proposal, feeling
that it was manifestly unjust to ask of Oxford what Westminster is
utterly unable to achieve.

A Trifle for Otho.
FoR having abetted the villany of the CzAR, the EMPEROR NApoleon
has given KING OTHo a scolding. Should this not have the desired
effect it is to be hoped that the Allied Powers will give his Grecian
SOME FOOL’S CAP FOR THE GUARDS.
We cannot think that the new Cap for the Guards, called the
“Albert Bonnet” can have been really designed by PRINCE ALBERT.
It looks rather as if it had been invented by the EMPEROR of Russia;
for it has the appearance of “a thing devised by the enemy” for, the
purpose of making the men ridiculous. , The Prince Consort has long
since arrived at years of discretion, and put away childish things; his
irons and the other toys with which it is said that he used to play at
hatter's shop. Besides, the Prince is a man of singular taste and
delicacy, and, precluded as he is by his position from sharing in the
dangers of active service, must of course, be content with gracefully
wearing his own uniform, as Field-Marshal, and could never think of
interfering with that of the army, of which he is not permitted to be
more than an ornament. -
The name of ALBERT has been assigned to the bonnet for no better
reason than that for which it has been given to half-boots. Some mere
civilian is responsible for the infliction of this ludicrous head-gear on
the Guards; somebody who knows nothing about military matters at
all, who has heard that there is a regiment called the Coldstream, has
confounded that word with Coldbath, and, making an additional
blunder, invented the cap for the Fusiliers; for this cap is the precise
pattern of a convict’s cap, and fear alone restrains the street boys from
shouting “That’s your ticket of leave!” as the wearers march by.
In fact, it is not fit to be worn on any march but the Rogues' March;
it is not a proper cap for any guard but a blackguard.

“As free as the air we breathe,” has long been a familiar quotation;
but it has only recently become in some degree a fact. §. the
window-tax existed the air we breathed was so far from free that it was
burdened with a heavy impost, and even now there is a great deal of air
breathed that is anything but gratuitous. The House of Commons
ought to be, and is the freest of all possible bodies, but if its members
were to be as free as the air they breathe, and no freer, they would be
under a very heavy impost, for their ventilation has cost them £200,000,
and air at even this #. is not always attainable. There are, in fact,
many instances in which the freedom of air is altogether aprocryphal,
and indeed the booksellers know that a mere puff is sometimes a rather
costly luxury.

PUNCH AMONG THE PAINTERS. NO. 2.
/* = ". late MR. WILKINs's punch-
bowl and pepper-boxes cover
two gathering places for pic-
tures, in one of which the
old masters are met together,
separated only by the breadth
of a corridor from the youn
masters of the day. The floo
just now sets so strong in the
direction of the younger gen-
tlemen, that it is not easy to
work out of it into the slack
water that lies, for the moment,
all but unstirred round the
* of the giants of
old. ut, strong as is the
temptation of fresh colour, fire-
new canvass, and contemporary
criticism eastwards, it is a very
wholesome discipline to resist
it and give an hour's reverent
meditation to RAPHAEL and
FRANCIA, to DEL PIoMBo and
TITIAN, before your pleasant,
easy-going chat with LAND-
SEER, FRITH, WARD, and the
rest of the lads over the way.
Such a visit will be found
wholesome in many ways, but
most of all as it may in some
measure prepare you for appre-
ciating your contemporaries.
There is my excellent and
wealthy, but slightly atra-
bilious friend, BISTRE. You
may hear him any day in his
own gallery (furnished at much
cost of money and experience during BISTRE's lengthened residence
in Italy), ng up the old, and pooh-poohing the new. But to see
Bistrº, in his bitterest glory you must meet him at the Academy
Exhibition, and hear his withering comments on all the crowd admire.
“Crude–raw-no, daylight-no transparency—no juiciness, Modern
Art! Pooh, Sir, there's no such thing!”. There he stands, venting
contempt about the doorway of the West Room, poisoning minds as
people pass it, or, as he conceives, implanting true art doctrine.
e has a valuable coadjutor in Šo a gentleman much hated by the
Academy, upon which he is in the habit of º: onslaughts
in all manner of periodicals, ever since they hung his first picture at
the top of the Octagon Roºm. From that day, forth SouR vowed
vengeance against them, and renounced the active practice of the
brush, for the more lucrative traffic in Old Masters, combining with
this, in his leisure hours, the function of Academy-crusher, Sour
imparts to BISTRE much familiarity with technical terms, and at the
same time sells him not a few pictures-of course, immense bargains.
And now the two are planted arm-in-arm in the doorway of the West
Room, dealing deadly stabs at wretched R.As. ; perfectly in earnest all
the while, for } long feeding of the eye on embrowned canvasses,
they have lost all natural appetite for fresh colour—not to speak of the
effects of a leetle jaundicing of disappointment.
I need not say this is not the temper of eye or mind I wish to
engender by your preliminary visit to the Old Masters. It is rather
that you may meet the BISTREs and Sours on something like equal
terms, being neither sº to the old when you contemplate the
new, nor steeled against the new when you look on the old. I
wish you to feel that Art is a living thing, and that its changes are
matters rather to be taken to heart and studied, than vituperated. In
the old time its themes were the grandest that could occupy human
minds-family distinctions, national, glories, religious beliefs. Its
show-places were palaces, council-halls, churches. Its patrons were
princes, magistrates, prelates, and popes. If it existed for the middle
class, it was in their collective character of a people, or in their indi-
vidual greatness as royal merchants. The populace partook of it as
passengers through the streets, or as worshippers in chapels and
churches. So whenever Art stepped down from her fellowship with
emperors and kings, doges and princes, it was for such grand function
as recording the life of a nation, or the faith of a world. How, with
such work to do, could Art be other than vast in dimensions, elevated
in aims, dignified in subjects, and powerful in execution? All these
; º, perforce, from the facts which surrounded and shaped
e Dalnter.
#. Bistres, if they admit this much, will tell you that, wanting such
- - - Not so. Art cannot

atrons, aims, and purposes, Art is now dead
She has been the cherished minister to the needs of the most civilised,
but she is found at work in the gross life of the lowest savage. She
has drawn light and colour from the sun and sky of Italy, but
can catch a new and shadowy beauty from the grey mists of fióiland.
She can make herself as much at home beside the homely board of a
Dutch or Flemish burgher, as in the marble courts of Venice, or the
frescoed halls of the Vatican. But she suits her dress and conversa-
tion to her guests; can be hail-fellow-well-met with JAN STEEN or
BRAUwer, amorously-courtly with WATTEAU or BouchER; proudl
patrician with TITIAN or WERONESE; picaresquely-picturesque wit
MURILLO ; ecstatically-beautiful with HAEL, or sternly-strong with
MICHAEL ANGELo. It is the same living spirit that stirs under all
these forms; And this same Art it is that, amid great discourage:
ments, and by dint of hard struggles, still lives and works with us and
for us, in this our convenient, expediency-loving, cotton-spinning,
railway-laying, material generation.
There is no wisdom in telling the poor Muse—when, with infinite

encouragingly by the hand, cherishing her and comforting her, and

won her a glory that she still remembers, she has made desperate
attempts from time to time to reanimate the dead forms of the past, to
smuggle herself into our town-halls and churches, and, to her dismay
and almost despair, has found herself pointed at with the finger of
scorn for animpostor and a counterfeit, Driven thence, still clinging to

she found never-failing solace, and ample recognition—out of doors,
under the everlasting sky, among the eternal mountains, amidst the
ever-springing life of the forest and the moor-land—driven from men—

CONSEQUENCES.
THERE is a pleasant little fireside game in France, called the Game
of Consequences, which we believe has lately, in defiance of the
Game Laws, been imported free of duty into this country. As soon as
it becomes popular (which every French º is pretty sure to do in
England), we suppose we shall be looked to as usual for a supply of
jocularities, § the constant reader will, as, usual, palm off as his
own. ... We are therefore tempted to anticipate the national demand by
furnishing the following:
The consequence of getting into an empty omnibus is the having to
wait until it’s filled before you start. -
The consequence of betting with a leg is that you are pretty sure
to put your foot in it. - -
The consequence of *...* haunch of venison sent you is the
having to invite a dozen friends to eat it. . - - -
The consequence of your daughter's wearing thin shoes is the having
a perpetual influenza in the house. -
he consequence of celibacy is the finding no one who cares a button
about you, as is sufficiently shown by the state of your shirts.
The consequence of arbitrating between man and wife is, that you
will satisfy neither, and be disliked by both. -
The consequence of tight lacing is a lengthened doctor's bill and
shortened breathing. - - - - -
The consequence of quarrelling with your wife is, that you will have to
go with her to Swan and EDGAR's the next morning for a peace offering.
The consequence of lending either a book, or an umbrella, or your
name to a i. is the comfortable certainty that the latter one will be
returned, and the former two won’t.
Hard Lines.
TAxATION, CoBDEN, is by war increased;
The side that wins at best but loses least.
But if to greedy tyrants you succumb
You then lose all, my buck, instead of some.

NATIONAL DEFENCES OF RUSSIA.
(From our own Correspondent.)
Esines the infernal machines
which have been sunk in the
Gulf of Finland for the annihila-
tion of the British Fleet, an
enormous galvanic battery has
been constructed by order of
the Emperor, for the same pur-
pose. It consists of several
thousand pairs of plates, each
forty feet square, contained in a
porcelain trough divided into
as many compartments of cor-
responding magnitude. This
formidable voltaic arrangement
is laid down on the north bank
of the Neva, along which it ex-
tends many miles. For its con-
struction the whole resources
of the empire have been taxed,
every copeck that could be ob-
tained having been used to form
the copper plates in combina-
tion with those of zinc. The
cells, where the battery is re-
quired to act, are filled with
nitric acid from an immense
reservoir containing hundreds
of hogsheads of that corrosive
fluid. With one end of the bat-
tery a wire, of about the thick-
ness of a man's leg, is connected,
and on the end of this wire is
fixed amass of charcoal ºf
several tons, and attenuated to a fine point. A similar wire, but longer, insulated, wit
gutta percha, is carried across the river under water, and emerges at the opposite bank,
where its extremity is, in like manner, pointed with charcoal. The charcoal points are so
arranged as to be exactly in a line one with the other. -
The moment the wire last mentioned is brought into connection with the battery, when the
latter is in action, a circuit is formed, and an arc of light, of ...iſ brilliancy, and
glowing with an almost inconceivable intensity of heat, plays between the two points of
charcoal across the river. When it is considered that in the electric fire thus produced by
means of an ordinary battery, platinum melts like wax in the flame of a candle, it is easy to
conceive what would be the fate of any vessel on getting between the charcoal points the
instant the galvanic fluid was turned on. - -
- A man-of-war, having a powder-magazine, would
of course instantly detonate and disappear. If SIR CHARLEs NAprºventures between the
points of these “mighty opposites” he will be a bold man. - ---
PROFEssoR Hocus has also submitted to the Emperor, a plan for destroying the British
Public by poisoning the East, wind, and is to receive a liberal reward if it answers. I am
not in a position to give you the details of this scheme with minute accuracy; but the agent
#. which the wind, is to be impregnated with deleterious, matter consists, I believe,
chiefly of prussic acid, which, as you are aware, is highly volatile. The principal objection tº
this project is the difficulty of limiting the operation of the poisoned wind, so that it, shall
not, in its course, injure Denmark and Sweden: but this, d; course, would vanish should
those States, think proper to side with the Western Powers. It has also been urged that
if the wind should change, the mischief would fall on the Autocrat's own, subjects: but his
º erial Majesty would sufficiently obviate this danger by keeping himself far enough out
of harm's way.
CLERICAL EXCHANGE NO ROBBERY.
“ANYTHING for a change,” seems to have its attractions for some of the clergy, as well
as the laity. Attention was called the other night in the House of Commons to a case
of mutability in clerical affairs, which seems to have been less satisfactory to the parishioners
than to theH.". engaged in the little “transaction.” There is a certain place called
Fyfield, in Hants, where the resident souls are handed over to be “cured ” in a rather
unceremonious manner. Whenever the incumbent is sick of his duty, or, as in one instance,
when the tradesmen are tired of trusting him, he effects an “exchange” with some other
minister who has a fancy for looking after the eternal interests of the Fyfield parishioners.
... We are sorry to find that one of the º of the Fyfield flock has, after seriously fleecin
it, handed it over to somebody else, and gone as Civil Chaplain to Hong Kong, where he j
be at liberty to pursue his sacred duties without having his tranquillity disturbed by the
clamours of distant creditors. He appears to have given a practical lesson of the fleeting
character of worldly wealth, by walking away with some º the parish funds and money
entrusted to him for charitable purposes. Of course, one story §§ is good till another is
told, and the reverend º may have a very good answer to the charge publicly made
ainst him in the House of Commons. As the Bishºp of...WINchesºn has described
§ respectable, and, as far as I am aware, well qualified to perform the duties of
haplaincy,” there may, possibly be some mistake; and we shall be very happy
º
him as
a Colonial
to hear, on competent_authority, that amid the numerous
- “exchanges” of incumbents in
the parish of Fyfield, there has, after all, been “no robbery.”
THE LAND OF GREECE.
(A Lyric of the Manchester School—after the
favourite BYRON Pattern.)
The Land of Greece the Land of Greece!
By BRIGHT and CoPDEN loved and sung,
Wherein, till England broke the peace,
With Manchester wide dealings sprung;
They’d take our yarns and cottons yet,
If but the Czar alone we'd let.
The merchants look to Manchester,
And Manchester to £. s. d.;
And musing there on profits gon
e
if it our trade with Greece tip.
Yet though in bargains close they shave,
I cannot deem the Greek a knave.
A cotton-spinner sat but now -
Where engines clank and steam-pipes fizz
And mules by thousands lay below, ...
And yarn in mountains—all were his.
He counted them at break of day—
And, a week after, there they lay!
Yes—there they lay !
My country
Looking facts fairly in the face.
For what is left the patriot here?
For Turks a curse—for Greeks a tear!
The º. of St. Petersburg -
Is Freedom's best and bravest friend:
There once was talk of “crumpling up.”
The Russias all; that’s at an end.
No, NICHOLAs is good and kind; ..
The Turks, effete, and base and blind.
Trust not for strength to soldiers' ranks;
Paying for them expenses swells:
In English bobs and foreign francs,
The only hope of safety dwells.
Extend your trade, at home, abroad;
Why take to force, when you have fraud?
Set me on land, or on the deep
l don't care which it is, not I–
So I can buy where goods are cheap,
So I can sell where goods are high.
A land of war shall ne'er be mine—
Give me yon roll of cotton-twine.
COBDEN AS A GREEK,
And where art thou,
On the warehouse floor
The spinner's foot is silent now,
The piecer's tramp resounds no more!
And must thy yarns, both coarse and fine,
No more find sale across the brine *
'Tis something, spite of sneer and blame,
To stand up boldly in one's place
And rouse the House to rage and shame,

HARD AS A BOARD.
FIERCE conflict is now raging
between the Guardians of
the Poor, in the various
parishes of England, and
the medical men whom the
said Guardians employ.
The tactics of §. Guar-
dians are simple but effec-
tive. They take advantage
of the overcrowded state of
the medical profession, and
of the desire of its rising
members to obtain some
public appointments which
may give them standing, to
offer the very smallest pos-
sible remuneration for the
services rendered by them.
The medical men, on the
other hand, have no re-
source but to do their duty
to those under their care,
and to appeal, on every fit-
ting occasion, to the Guar-
dians' sense of shame, though, of course, such appeals are about as futile
as an attempt to coerce a #. by whipping him with a play-bill.
Mr. Anthºn, the Medical Officer to the Poor at Deptford º
tººl the following receipt to the Guardians of the Greenwich
alon. --
*Received from the Guardians of the Greenwich Union the paltry sum of £20, for
thirteen weeks extra service as house-to-house visitor, sanitary inspector, and for
medicines supplied to the sick r of Deptford, by which I find my services as a
Professional Man, are valued at the same rate as those of a journeyman mechanic.”
The Greenwich Guardians have been so delighted with MR.ARTHUR's
testimony to their economy, that they have forwarded the document to
the Poor Law Commissioners, in the belief that it will obtain for them
a certificate of good conduct, or perhaps even a medal, formed of
congenial brass. We fear, however, that they will be disappointed, as
the competition is very great.
Punch does not himself know whether to accord the palm to them,
or to the Guardians of those two unions who pay their medical man
a salary of £2 per annum for attendance and medicines;, or to the
Guardians of Todmorden, where the medical officer earned £712s. in
one year, for attendance upon, and medicines supplied to aº
of 11,000 persons; or to the Guardians of the hdale Union, who
appointed a Surgeon to vaccinate under the New Act, but paid him.
under the Old Act, whereby they saved a shilling per case; or to the
Risbridge Board, who, when they were required to name some public
places to which the poor might bring their children, for vaccination,
selected the belfries of the different churches in the district, as ...i
mice cold, damp, and windy apartments, in which the congregate
infants might catch catarrhs and rheums. -
Punch trusts that MR. BAINEs has his eye upon these things, and
means to reward the Guardians according to their deserts, and he
hopes to see the day when these Guardians, like ADDIson's Cato, shall
have, not only their BAINEs, but their Antidotes.
APOPLEXY MADE EASY.
SoME days since Mr. Punch was startled, from the
usually characterises his actions, by the sight of the
advertisement:-
O ALL WHO ARE IN WANT OF A FIT.-The importance of
which requires no elucidation to convince the most sceptical how indispensably
necessary it is to health, comfort, and appearance.”
As Mr. Punch met with this startling proposition in the advertising
columns of the Lancet, he could but look on its author as a homºeopa-
thist, who, thinking that similia similibus curantur, had got it into his
head that a slight attack of apoplexy or paralysis might be indispensably
necessary to the health, comfort, and appearance of those who had
reason to dread either malady. Perhaps { ought Mr. Punch) the man
has found means to avert apoplexy by inoculating people wit indiges-
tion; but the more remarkable feature of his theory is, that a fit is
indispensably necessary to the appearance, a notion quite at variance
with that generally entertained.
The advertisement then continued thus:-
* R.T. Pranam, while willing to avoid the present system of puming, adopts this
means of making known his Self-Acting Indicator of the Human Figure.
Taking this paragraph in connection with that which preceded it, it
was clear that “the present system of puffing,” which R. PIGRAM
Kº: which
ollowing terrific
wished to avoid, must be the short-windedness, and wheezy, stertorous
breathing of persons disposed to apoplexy; and thence it followed that
the “Self-Acting Indicator of the Human Figure” must be, in all
probability, a machine for testing the increased bulk of the patient, or,
perhaps, an elastic collar, so graduated as to show, da day, the
growing thickness of the neck. Having stated his case, #. #. PigBAM
became taciturn, and abruptly wound up his prelection with the fol-
lowing axiom and corollary-
“An invention can only be known by its results. A trial will not only give satis-
faction, but will justify in favouring R. T. Pigham with their recommendations.”
Mr. Punch tried for awhile to discover from whom these recommen-
dations were to be extorted; but, failing in the attempt, began seriously
to meditate the purchase of the * Self-Acting Indicator;” for since his
abandonment of his former migratory life, he has grown somewhat fat
and plethoric. And lo! at this crisis came some one, who told him
that R.T. Pignay was a Tailor. But Punch cannot believe this.

Ho! fetch my helmet hither, and bring me my cuirass,
Though I need no steel breastplate; no morion of brass:
Armed with the panoply of faith, shall I fear mortal man?
Go forth, my hosts, to victory, and I will lead the van
For wherefore should the scoffer, without rebuke, declare
That I have stirred the contest, which to brave I do not dare,
And send my slaves to die for me, but from the conflict skulk,
Content, within my guarded walls, to hide my coward bulk?
Give me my sword, which the profane affirm I dread to wield,
My jackboots, also, and my steed; myself shall take the field.
Against the bands of MAHOMET in person I'll advance,
And charge the English heathen and the infidels of France.
Talk not to me of danger! What, at my army’s head,
Shall I be less secure than on my throne, or in my bed ?
Can any failure or defeat, can life or honour's loss,
Betide the champion orthodox—the warrior of the Cross?
Never to be confounded I have proclaimed my trust
A hypocrite all Europe will account me, as it must,
At bullets or at bayonets if I betray alarm,
As if I thought such things could do my carcase any harm.
I therefore of my forces the foremost man will ride,
And all the shots shall miss me, the swords shall glance aside
So shall I silence all the tongues that now against me wag,
And say that I can do no more than bluster, cant, and brag.
Millions of lives in spending, my courage shall be shown,
No more of others only, for I #: my own.
I'll fight like ALEXANDER and other conquerors old;
Shall NICHOLAs a warrior prove of less heroic mould P
And when º foes are vanquished, as they are sure to be,
The knout I'll wave in triumph o'er all that now are free.
With absolute dominion the world at large I’ll bless,
All Parliaments abolish, and annihilate the Press.
My helmet therefore bring me, and all my warlike gear;
Hold! wait a bit—what ails me? I’m taken very queer.
Those tidings from Odessa have troubled me with qualms,
Here ends my war-song for to-day—we’ll now go back to psalms.
WANTED A HERO.
A FRENch piece is now ºf erformed at the St. James's Theatre,
in which the hero is an * ish actor, who has become the object of
the attachment of a young lady, whom he disgusts by pretending to
get drunk, because her father's pride will not allow him to consent to
the alliance. We have been rather amused by the critics in the daily
papers, who differ as to the actor whose life has furnished the anecdote
bn which the drama is founded. One critic says it is GARRIck, another
alleges that it is KEMBLE ; but whether STEPHEN, John, CHARLEs, or
the late loud-tongued HARRy, of the Cobourg in its most Cobourgy
days, no one can enlighten us. For our own parts, we see no need to
go back so far as Gºrrick, or even KEMBLE, for the hero who won the
ſcart of a young lady in the boxes. We have seen young ladies at the
Victoria 3. smitten by Hicks, and we have been told that
Goversal in the height of his imperial career, had at his feet half the
milliners of Stangate.
The GARRicks and the KEMBLEs are not the only actors who have
won the hearts of the female part of an audience, nor do we think the
tragedians should be allowed the merit of fascination exclusively to
themselves, as if the tender passion could º be inspired by the
passion—anything but tender sometimes—of the serious actor: the
dress goes much further than the acting in these theatrical affairs, of
the heart, and we have seen the walking gentleman, while decorated
with spangles and bedizened with º stars, greeted with sup-
ressed mutterings of “what a duck!” from a female spectator, who
ad evidently fallen deeply in love with him from the moment when he
threw back his cloak and announced his nobility by showing his glass
breast-buckle. We hope the friends of some of our living actors,will
claim for them the interest which belongs to the “professional,” whose
life may have furnished the incident that has given rise to the French
play of “Sullivan.”
The Old Girls they've left Behind them.
Those who wish to do a good turn to the wife of a soldier on foreign
service, cannot do better than give her a mangle. If any of our readers
should have a mother who is about to sell her mangle, we earnestl
entreat him to look out for the respectable wife of some soldier ...}
and let her have it a bargain. Many a poor woman will be able to turn
an honest penny if she has the opportunity of turning a mangle.

JENKINS AT THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR'S
BALL.
THE king never dies, and the sovereign of penny-a-liners belongs to
a line that will never, become extinct. The recent Fancy, Ball at the
l'rench Embassy has brought out JENKINs, in all the colours of his
rainbow livery. He is confessedly
“The Monarch of flunkeys
We crowned him long ago,
With a loud loud laugh,
And a bushel of chaft,
And the cap and bells—hol hol"
If ever there were a pretender to a throne—based on the solid found-
ation of rubbish continually being shot forth—those pretensions are at
once rendered absurd, by the undoubted sovereignty of JENKINs in the
realms and reams he occupies. Over his own peculiar kind of subjects
he is indeed supreme; and over such a subject he had an opportunity
of showing his absolute sway on the day after the Fancy Ball given by
the French Ambassador.
He begins by ...;
a
- the impossibility of mentioning the matter
“in terms of common-
ce narrative and detail”—for “common-
place ’’ is not the sort of place that would suit JENKINs. He tells us
that “throughout the whole of $º. afternoon there was much
excitement in the neighbourhood of Albert Gate,” a passage which
proves that the writer had begun to lurk, early in the day, about the
area railings of the Embassy... While thus occupied he discovered that
‘...the approaching visit of HER MAJESTY formed a fertile theme of
discussion to the quidnuncs of the neighbourhood.” Who may be the
quidnuncs ài. to we cannot tell; but we know there is a pawn-
broker's next door, and a publichouse next door but, one, so that
JENKINs by º: in at the former, and chewing a quid at the latter,
may have been allowed to join in the discussions he speaks about. His
observations were for some time confined to the “outside of the
mansion,” which he seems to have been hanging about from an early
hour; and from ...]". manner, in which he alludes to “the
groups watching anxiously each opening of the great doors,” there is
little doubt that the nose of JENKINs was a prominent feature of the
group, as viewed by the hall-porter from the inside of the premises.
In this position, JENKINs caught a jº. of “the huge bales of cocoa
nut matting and crimson, cloth’’ which were being “borne in by van
loads to decorate the staircase.”
Another external object that seems to have attracted the attention
of JENKINs was a sort of gym.
nastic proceeding on the part
of “two patriotic neighbours
in Knightsbridge Road,” who
“drew a line across if early
in the afternoon from the tops
of their houses, where, the
united flags of England,
France, Turkey and America,
floated triumphantly in the
breeze.” Qne of “the two
patriotic neighbours” was an
adjacent publican, who is pro-
bably not very particular where
he “draws the line” between patriotism and puffery, or what flags float
tºº so that he is enabled to draw a few extra gallons of
er.
rations of the exterior were indeed such as to invite attention”—the
only invitation, he appears to have received. But he was not to be
defeated, and he sº contrives to smuggle his * in under
circumstances which the following passage unmistakably indicates:—
“The preparations in the interior were so admirably managed as to be brought to a
close early in the afternoon, after which all was repose and order throughout the
mansion.'
It is clear that JENKINs had been watching his opportunity to gain an
entrance. “Early in the after-
noon all was repose throughout
the mansion.” JENKINs evi-
dently got in while the hall por:
ter was asleep. Having gained
the hall, where he ought to have
begun to feel himself at home,
JENKINs takes a peep at the
4- º: of the staircase,”
and finding that “all is repose?”
he ventures “opposite the en-
trance to the hall,” where he
finds the “chancellerie of the
embassy now devoted to the uses of a cloak-room.” This is not a
yery considerable deviation from the ordinary use of the apartment
for a collection of cloaks would not be ill-adapted to a chamber devoted
to acts of diplomacy.
JENFINs was evidently an outsider, for he says, “the deco-|h
Creeping carefully to the right, JENKINs discovers.' the Supper-
room, where tables set out with exceeding taste sparkled with rare
fruits and costly viands.” We can imagine the extent to which
JENKINs's mouth must have watered as he crept about amon
“cherries, at a guinea a pound,
and peaches at forty-eight shil-
lings per dozen.” It is fortunate
that the couplet of DEAN Swift
__º “Always pick a peach
ſ -- When it's within your reach,”
|
-- house until after the fete com-
menced, for we find him peeping
through a plate-glass door,” and witnessing a sight that must have
filled him with envy. He in fact gazed upon “a band of musicians
all arrayed in blue surcoats with the arms of the embassy emblazoned
on the front in rich gold em-
broidery — the Count WA-
LEwski having inherited
from Poland this fashion of
jºi. in livery.”
The sight of the embroidery
on the coats, and indeed the
livery altogether, came home
to JENKINs's “business and
bosom” in a very forcible
manner. “It certainly,” says
JENKINs, who is, of course,
familiar with his own figure
in a looking-glass,” “It— -
(the livery)—certainly very greatly enhances the effect.” While gazing
with admiration on the liveried musicians “a refreshing breeze first
reminded the guest that a window had been taken out,” and the
probability is that the absence of the window may have reminded the
intruder of an aperture through which he might expect to have been
pitched had he §. discovered. At all events, he hurries away from
the spot, for he says, “We therefore will visit the drawing-room,
where most of the guests first assembled.” Having once got among
the guests in their fancy dresses,
JENKINs, in his very fanciful
livery, must have felt himself
comparatively safe; and his nar-
rative assumes from this point a
tone of greater confidence.
“Ascending thestaircase,” says
JENKINs, “to the next flight we
enter the tea-rooms. Here the
fresh air and moonlight scenery
of the Park will tempt many a
visitor to stayin lively enjoyment
of his escape from grandeur and
heated luxury to the refreshing quiet and coolness of the charms of
nature.” Fancy JENKINs escaping from grandeur,”-or, in other

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WAR POSTMAN.
oNTENT that our soldiers and
sailors are at their post, the
authorities seem to think
it needless to dispatch any
post to our sailors and
soldiers. The neglect, in
transmitting or delivering
letters and newspapers
from England, to the gal-
lant fellows who are with
Sir CHARLEs NAPIER and
LoRD, RAGLAN is calling
out the most indignant
remonstrances from their
friends at home. One gen-
tleman has adopted the
Nº. }
Sº N º ingenious plan. of at º:
º º inviting attention, to the
º º circumstances, and of com-
&º municating with his son,
§§ by publishing in the Times
- Tº the information he desires
the young officer to re-
ceive. Mr. Punch has been
besieged with applications
to open a portion of his
columns for the same pur-
- pose. He is eager to do
what he can for the comfort of the services, and under certain restric-
tions (the chief of which is that he must be allowed to condense the
epistles as if they were for telegraphic dispatch) he is willing to ensure
communication łº the service and its friends, by inserting in
his journal, every word of, which is read in every part of the world,
the material contents of letters which may be sent to his office. He
forwards the first batch; but in the mean time he begs to express a
hope that MR. Row1AND HILL, so worthily promoted to high
authority in the Post Office, will celebrate his accession to office by
looking into the matter. If Government despatches are so wretchedly
slow that the Press is compelled to furnish the information, there is no
reason for applying the same rule to private despatches.
“Is Anella Atkinsox to HENRY MAcFARLAN (H.M.S. Smasher, Baltic). Has cried
ever since he went away. Has been to three balls, but would not dance at any of
them. All her partners assured her that she was looking ill. Hopes he will be true
to her as she is to him. Should break her heart if anything happened to him, and
begs him to keep down stairs out of the way of the guns. Has had a lovely bracelet
from CAPTAIN W., but takes no pleasure in wearing it, and only puts it on because,
being a cable in gold, it reminds her of Hesay's ship. CAPTAIN. V. has promised to
take her to the Opening of the Crystal Palace; but what does she care for palaces?
If she goes, it will only be that she may have something to tell HENRY in her next.
Was at the Opera on Tuesday (CAPTAIN W. got them a box), but could think of
nothing but the last time she was there with HENRY. States that she encloses a
violet, but if so, it must have dropped out, and was more probably forgotten.”
“Jon Edwand Rattleton to Charles RATTLEros (Gallipoli). Urges him to go
it, and thrust himself bravely forward, regardless of danger, and keep up the honour
of England. Wishes to know, as CHARLss's cousin and heir, whether he can execute
any family business for him.”
“Launa Pendledbop to Honace PENDLennor (Scutari Barracks, Asia). This letter
is from a young wife to her husband, and is chiefly occupied with information re-
garding their child, who is coming on delightfully, and fell out of bed five times on
Monday, but never cried, and takes the greatest notice of everything It states that a
jee-jee (so in original) went past the window on Tuesday or Wednesday, and the infant
immediately clapped his hands. A very favourable opinion of the infant's fineness,
from the family medical adviser, is given. There are also details of the impertinence
of one JANE, who has been sent away, and of the characteristics of a new comer,
Saman, to whom the infant did not take at first, but now does, Kisses are sent
in P.S.”
“Moses Tomit to Frederick St. PELAgrº Montague (Scutari Barracks). Ex-
presses great surprise that Ma. Mostaque should have left England without taking
up some of his exeptencies (so in orig.) and 1.0.U.'s. Especially complains that he
did not complete paying for the silver watch, for which he has as yet paid only £47 and
some discounts. Threatens to outlaw him, “without" he will tell the address of a
CAPTAIN HARLEybuffed, against whom MR. Tobit breathes great wrath. Mentions
in P.S. that he has got some studs, skeleton pattern, which would be just the thing for
Ms. Mostague, and intends to keep them for him. Thinks he has been treated very
shabbily; and swears he never got a farthing back of the original £50 lent last
September, except the principal and a miserable £20 note, and some costs for his
brother the attorney.”
“Many Baown to JAMEs PETERs (Seaman aboard H.M.S. Spankerboom, Black Sea).
Says she reads the papers in the hopes of seeing that her Pergas has performed some
galiant action; but Pleeseman Z, 9789, who is kind enough to come down most
evenings and comfort her and Cook, laughs, and says she may wait long enough, and
that Loan ABERDREx will not allow the Admiral to do much. Thinks if she were
JAMEs she would up and tell the Admiral out, there and then, that he had better not
mind no sneaks. Says the half-sixpence is safe, and Missis is more cantankerous than
ever: but she has a party next week, and MARY means to be ill in the middle of the
preparations, to spite her.”
“SAMUEL FLIMsy to Jacop MANIFord (Reporter, OMER PACHA's Army). Advises
him to cook up something more spicy for his next, or he may get recalled; for the
Editor has hinted that it would be cheaper to fudge up accounts of some startling and
bloody battles, from the correspondence of the Times, Chronicle, &c., than to pay Ma.
Maxifold for his stupid descriptions. Asks him who is to contradict him, let him
say what he likes, and recommends him to “come out a little.’”
“Lord Apprºper:N to Aprimal, DUNDAs (Varna). Begs that he will strike as early
and heavy a blow at Russia as he can, Lord ABEmperºx's only object in life being to
humble the haughty and deceitful tyrant, Nicholas.
“You understand.’”
The postscript is underlined
seven times.
OBSEQUIES MADE EASY.
THE London Necropolis º advertises First and Second Class
Graves, and First, Second, and Third Class Funerals. This sort of
nomenclature suggests the remark that Life is a railway, of which the
terminus is at the Cemetery. However, we are glad to find that the
fares—to follow out the style of hraseology—of the Company are very
moderate, being £2 10s. for the first class, and £1 for the second; the
third not specified. We wish success to this undertaking, which is
the most reasonable that we ever yet heard of, and will, j, prove
the means of saving many a poor family, bereaved of its bread-winner
the waste of much money, in addition to that loss, on a foolish and
useless exhibition of manners and customs, rendered compulsory by
the usage of a sºciety which calls itself civilised, but is, in this respect,
no better than the most barbarous description of natives.
CURIOUS CHINESE PROWERBS.
ON CONTENTMENT.
THE ripest fruit often grows on the roughest wall.
It is the small wheels of the carriage that come in first.
The man who holds the ladder at the bottom is frequently of more
service than he who is stationed at the top of it.
Contentment is to the mind what a frame is to a cucumber–summing
it, and lifting it, even, from a dunghill.
The turtle, though brought in at the area-gate, takes the head of
the table.
Better, be the cat in a philanthropist's family than a mutton pie at
a king's banquet.
The Learned Pig didn't learn its letters in a day.
True merit, like the pearl inside an oyster, is content to remain
quiet until it finds an opening.
The top strawberries are eaten the first.
He whº leaves early gets the best hat.
Pride sleeps in a gilded crown–Contentment in a cotton mightcap.
No! To BE FATHOMED-There are secrets, like springs, that lie too
deep for boring—and a woman's age is one of them.

THE ROW AT THE ROTUNDA.
IN the Town of Dublin, where there’s always bubblin’
The germs of piety and discontent,
All the religious met in force prodigious;
Though some litigious, all with one consent.
A stern objection to the base inspection
Of holy nuns did every heart possess:
A detestation of that legislation
Which no imagination can express.
ARCHBishop CULLEN, who perceived that sullen
Hot animosity stamped certain brows,
Gave us a warning, full of sacred larning,
Politics consarning to beware of rows.
But FATHER MARSHALL, with a tongue impartial,
PRINCE ALBERT's Roy AL HIGHNess did attack,
Remarks for making, Mother Church that shaking,
In coorse was evil spaking behind her back.
On treason's border, he was called to order,
Which civil intimation he obeyed,
And without staying still went on inveighing,
We all hooraying at the spache he made.
When he had ended the uproar extended,
REYNoLDs blackguarded LucAs like a thief,
And back to render the abuse. not tender
Was that defender of our thrue belief.
And then a rumpus quite beyond all compass
Arose us boys for unity between;
Sure such a shindy, 'mong the Sikhs in Indy,
Or when the says were windy, ne'er was seen.
How them deceivers, and them unbelievers,
The heretic Commons, and the haythen l’cers,
Must take delight in all our scratchin', bitin',
And scandalously fightin' by the ears'
Scene of contention too absurd to mention —
And that is why my narrative I prune–
Of Brass Band braying the idea conveying,
The instruments all playing out of tune. .
THE I)EAD LETTERS FOR THE BALTIC.
“A LETTER from home” is a luxury that must, it seems, be paid for
as a luxury by our sailors in the Baltic. Official theory says that the
men shall receive their letters for the postage of one penny; but hard
fact announces that twenty-four times that sum shall be exacted.
We have been made acquainted with the contents of a letter from a
seaman, on board the fleet to his mother at home, to which, as it ma
be applicable to a thousand other cases, we give publicity. It will
serve as a “warning ” to the mothers and sisters of many of the
men on whose courage and fidelity all England, and indeed nearly all
the civilised world, has staked its best interests. A sailor writing from
the Baltic to his mother, at the beginning of the month, tells her that
it is expected they will begin work in good earnest on the 10th of
May, and informs her where, if anything happens to him, she may get
the § that is due to him. But the addition to the letter is the most
touching part of it, and we give it in his own words as nearly as our
memory can carry them:—
“Please don't write any more letters; and tell SARAH (his sister) not to write any
more, as we have to pay two shillings a-piece for them when we get them.”
The reflections suggested by these words we forbear from putting
into type, as every reader will find them in his own heart, if he happens
to have one.
NEW DEAMATIC LICENSE.
WE hear that a new Proscenium is in course of º at the
Princess's Theatre. The playhouse was wont to bear the old sig-
nificant motto–Keluti in Speculum, That is vulgar; now MR. KEAN
has obtained such notoriety for his production of French Hobgoblin
pieces, that his new Proscenium will bear the following appropriate
inscription, approved by the Lord Chamberlain:-
CHARLES KEAN,

GIWING JOSEPII THE GO-BY.
MR. HuME wishes the wills, which are at present admirably kept
at Doctors’ Commons, to be deposited in a safer and more convenient
place. Quite proper. But the veteran reformer should not stoop to
exaggeration. In the debate on the subject, he said–
“With regard to Doctors' Commons, he had himself examined it yesterday, and the
room was so narrow and inconvenient, that it was scarcely possible to pass the fifteen
or sixteen persons who were there engaged in making references.”
This is obviously an inaccurate statement; for what says the
proverb P “Where there’s a will there’s a way.” And therefore
there must have been a Way for MR. HuME to pass the fifteen or
sixteen examiners of Wills. We trust that he will qualify this state-
ment, the rather that, it will give, him another opportunity of
exposing a locality which deserves all that can be said against it.

THERE was a great talk in the debate on the Malt Tax about its
being a “Consumer's Question.” We don't know what this may be,
but we should think that the most general question, and not always
the pleasantest one, which every consumer must go through the form
of putting, was “ Winſ ſºvº. I got to pay?”

THE CZAR'S DIABOLICAL SUGGESTION.
HE last accounts
of Nicholas re-
resent, him, as
ying still-in both
senses of the
phrase. He does
not risk his im-
perial skin, and he
immolates his im-
perial word. The
subjoined epistle to
Osten-SackEN is
a fresh specimen
of the EMPERoR
of Russia’s vera-
city; but to de-
scribe it as simply
false would be
doing an injusticc
either to the pro-
found *; or
astonishing folly,
whereby it must on
the one hand or on
the other have been
dictated. Observe
that it is quoted
minus blasphemy. .
“On the day when the inhabitants of Odessa, united in their orthodox temples, were
celebrating the death of . . . . the allies of the enemies of his . . name attempted
a crime against that city of peace and commerce, against that city where all Europe in
her years of dearth has always found open granaries. The fleets of France and England
bombarded for twelve hours our batteries and the habitations of our peacefultitizens,
as well as the merchant ships in the harbour. But our brave troops, led by you in
person, and penetrated by a profound faithin the supreme Protector of justice, gloriously
repelled the attack of the enemy against the soil which in Apostolic times received
the saintly precursor of the Christian religion in our holy country.
“The heroic firmness and devotion of our troops, inspired by your example, have
been crowned with complete success, the city has been saved from destruction, and the
enemies' fleets have disappeared. As a worthy recompense for so brilliant an action
we grant you the Order of St. Andrew.
“St. Petersburg, April 21 (May 3).”
* >
“Nicholas.”
In this style after his first lesson—not from MR. LEwis, but—from
ADMIRALs †º. and HAMELIN does the Czar write. He says that
the allied fleets bombarded the habitations of the peaceful citizens, and
the merchant ships in the harbour, when it is notorious that they spared
both. He asserts that the enemy was gloriously repelled, whereas the
French and English retired after having silenced the batteries with a
loss of some two or three men killed, and considerably under thirty
wounded between them. And thus, he adds, the city was saved from
destruction, although he had just before said that it had been bom-
barded for twelve hours. A lie so inconsistent we English never
hear told, except in a felon's dock; but Nature asserts herself wonder-
fully: and the same incongruity of falsehood appears in the burglar
who stands in ankle-jacks, and the greater villain who stalks in jacks
of larger dimensions; in BILL SIKEs and in Nick Romanoff.
Probably if Romanoff were to come to be hanged, as, if caught,
the objection, to capital punishment in the abstract is the only reason
*} he should not be, he would, º as some of our desperate
ans do, persist in an impudent denial of his crimes to the very last.
However, the object of these remarks is not to moralize on the
Czar's immorality, but to expose his craft—assuming the foregoing
letter to betray the knave and not the fool. To affirm that our ships
were beaten, to declare that they bombarded the city and the mer-
chantmen, whereas the facts were just the reverse, what object can
these falsehoods have had, but to tempt the two Admirals to put
instantly back to Odessa, and show Nicholas that he is not to brag
and lie with impunity at their expense, by º the city, whence he
says they were repelled, to the ground, and blowing every Russian
vessel to atoms? And then the Emperor might have arraigned us at
the bar of European opinion for the barbarity which he would have
provoked us to commit, and which, doubtless, we might commit to any
extent, on his subjects, for aught he would care, so long as it answered
s purpose.
But ſet not ºur brave sailors, be tempted by the adversary to give
them this handle. The next Russian city they attack, they must feel
themselves strongly instigated to leave not one stone upon another.
But never may Britons suffer the Imperial brute to drag them down to
the level of his own ruffianism. At least, let them direct their fire on
no dwelling-house, unless they have good reason to suspect that it
contains the Czar. -
One more word as to the Imperial style. Its florid character gives
similarity is particularly observable in the allusion to “the soil which
in Apostolic times,” &c. Can it be that Nicholas believes himself to
be the Pope. Does a dash of madness really mingle with the rascality
of the blasphemous old reprobate?
IMPROVEMENTS IN ARMY CLOTHING.. "
IN consequence of the immense success of the cap invented for the
Guards to pull down over the eyes, we understand it is intended–
sacrifiging appearance altogether to comfort—to substitute for the
head-dress aſ present worn by the Line and the Militia, a plain cotton
nightcap. In this regulation, one object which has been had in view
is to conciliate Manchester, and reconcile it in some measure to the
increase of the Army. Many other ridiculous alterations in military
costume are also in contemplation; it being considered that to i.
about absurdly, clothed practises a soldier's courage, so that, the
ºfficer or man who has been accustomed to expose himself in the shell-
jacket, or the Albertbonnet, may be expected to face anything.
RUSSIAN PASS WORD.
A Most unhappy indiscretion,
To use a mºderate expression,
Has Russia's Emperor committed,
His º: to be pitied—
In war, through mere ambition raging,
Unmercifully by º
Goaded like cattle to the slaughter,
They daily shed their blood like water.
The simple creatures make this gory
Libation to their Momarch's ;
Qh! could one ray of reason brighten
Their intellects, their darkness lighten,
To perish thus, º see, is folly
Deplorable, and melancholy :
And quickly would an observation
From mouth to mouth pass through the nation,
Suggestive, though expressed with lenience,
Icholas is an inconvenience.”
“A Money-Making Parson.”
PRINCE ALBERT's denunciation of this animal—the nominal Christian
dove become the acquisitive magpie—has made a great sensation
throughout the Church. The Bishop of LoNinos has expressed a deep
sense of gratefulness for the condition to which it has pleased Providence
to call him. Had he remained a parson, what money he might have
made!, Rising to the purer height of a Bishopric, what money he has
refused to make | The amount is said to be quite unknown.
Gladstone's Presentation Plate.
We have lost the “Emperor's Cup” at Ascot, but we have got
instead an Emperor's Beer Jug,”—for thanks to Nicholas, every
Englishman's Beer-Jug will cost more to have it filled now than it did
formerly. By the by...it would be only a generous thing for the
CHANGELLoR of THE ExchEQUER, in reward for the proper spirit that
was displayed in throwing up the Cup, to present Ascot with an
“EMPERoR's Mug”—the Mug to be made as handsome as national
indignation would allow, and to be paid out of the proceeds of the
additional duty on Malt.
Prejudice in sport made Friendship in Earnest.
We recollect there was a game at school called “French and
En º and this game consisted in two persons taking hold of a rope,
and pulling against one another as hard as ever they could. However,
his game must be, altered now, and a fresh name found for it, con-
sidering that the French and English at present are holding on the
same line of policy, and pulling the same way in the most friendly
Inauller.

THINGS IN THE WATER.
“MR. PUNCH, - - -
“I AM a loyal subject, and shall this very day—the birth-da
of HER MAJESTY-drink her #. health, upstanding, uncovered,
in a bumper of pump-water. Therefore, in the few lines I feel Com-
pelled to put upon paper, you must not believe that I am a low Radical;
quite the reverse, whatever that may be.
“I am, Sir, a teetotaller; and consequently the overseer, of the
morals of my neighbours. if I drink toast an -water, what right has
anybody else to tipple thick, treacly stout P If, in a state of hilarity—
for such moments will arrive—I quaff a bottle of ginger-beer, that very
jocund circumstance should touch the rest of the world with a wide
and deep disgust for BAss's bitter. I wear a, water-lily in my
holiday button-hole, let no man flaunt before the world that bacchanalian
flower denominated sops-in-wine. - - - -
“And this, Sir, logically—for if anything makes a man logical, it is
water—logically brings, me to my argument. Last Saturday, Sir, the
Royal Albert was launched at Woolwich; to which I have no objection
—altogether the contrary. But, Sir, as a patriot and a teetotaller, I
must protest against the heathen custom of christening a ship with
wine—intoxicating wine. Our wooden walls, Sir, are made of oak;
oaks, I need hardly perhaps inform you, grow from acorns. You might
as well water the acorns with gin, as baptize the full-grown oaks with
sherry. The logic of this, Sir, must strike you; or I have taken; the
º to very little purpose. Well, Sir, the QUEEN baptized the ship;
uti give you the shuddering account from the newspapers:–
“‘SIB JAMEs GRAHAM explained to HER MAJESTY the mode of performing the bap-
tismal rite, and the suspended bottle was pointed out to her, with due directions as to
the mode of breaking the same, and of christening the good ship. The bottle was a
small one, of clear crystal, FILLRD with sherby, covered with fine thick Honiton lace,
and having two wreaths of roses, thistles, and shamrocks entwined round it, and attached
near the top and bottom by silver cord, was suspended in its proper position. To the
great delight oil the assembled spectators the QUEEN herself advanced to the bows of
the ship, and MR. WILLIAM M'PHERson Rice, master-shipwright, placed the bottle
into HER MAJEsty's hands, and after two ineffectual attempts, owing to the bottle
falling obliquely on the metal plate against which it was to be dashed, the bottle was
broken by Her MAJEsty, who at the same moment emphatically exclaimed, “God
bless the Royal Albert / "'
“Now, Sir, I am not a superstitious man; on the contrary, whatever
cobwebs of that sort imay have had within me have long ago been
rinsed out, so that pure reason shines through me—wherever I find it
—like the sun through a cucumber frame. I am not superstitious;
but I do ask you, -if we are not to tremble for the destiny of the Royal
Albert sent into the wide waters with a bottle of sherry—(as for, the
size, that’s nothing; it might, be a physic, phial or a magnum, I think
the intemperate call it)—with a bº. of sherry in his figure head
With such an amount of intoxicating fluid there, is it to be expected
that the Royal Albert will-as sailors say—answer his helm ? Is it
even to be h
º that he won’t roll in the trough of the sea? Is it to
be imagined fo -
r a moment that (saving his Royal Highness) he will
behave well? § no means. With that quantity of liquor continually
about him, he'll be always missing stays, and continually falling foul of
everything...That figure-head dº with ...'. continually sleep
upon the middle watch, and—I believe I am right, Sir, in the phrase-
will never have a sharp look-out for anything. As for sailing in the
wind's eye, it’s impossible: for sherry, Sir, sherry is only another word
for blind intoxication. -
“What a moral may be found in that immoral ceremony! Consider,
Sir, the bottle filled with sherry is “covered with fine thick Honiton
lace.” Now, Sir, isn't that a picture of wanton temptation arrayed in
all the filmy beauties of the loom (I believe I’m º to betray the
manly reason P, Is not sherry only another name for DALILAH, and the
thick Honiton lace the bedizenment of the frail one? As for the ‘two
wreaths of roses,’ what are they but the blushes that burn in the nose
of a tippler, while the thorns, like pins into a pincushion, go unfelt into
his heart? As for the ‘silver cord, it's nothing to my mind but, a
piece of hemp-of hººp-ºº: And then, think of the
moral of the whole ceremony! A loving and a faithful wife dashing a
bottle at her beloved husband's figure-head with all the royal children
beholding it. After this, can it ever be expected that the Royal Albert
will take a Russian? No; for he has º taken too much sherry.
My only fear is, that with the wine still in his head he doesn't—and
who's to wonder at it?—run ashore for more º -
." But I have done, Sir MR. BºIFMoTH Pop has the subject for
his next lecture, and will—with all his fire-engine force-improve
upon it... I am delighted to say that the cause of teetotalism is striking
root. We are earnest men, Sir; and some of us in our earnestness,
are, we hope, not to be restrained by a weak, consideration for mere
truth, If we can get hold of any story about anybody in particular,
we have a pretty way of turning the tale inside out; but then, it is
all in the way of temperance, and for the crystal loveliness of water.
or instance. There was a well-known person named CHARLEs LAMB.
He wrote a paper called ‘The Confessions of a Drunkard. Pat, Sir,
we put the whole matter upon the man himself, and called it 'The
Confessions of CHARLEs LAMB.” Not but what this might have been
improved into, ‘The Confessions of the Drunkard, CHARLEs LAMB.’
This may not be mere truth; but intemperance is not to be met by
simple truth: at times, drunkenness must be coaxed.
*The illustrious author of Truth in a Well, in sir Buckets; at 2s. 6d.
per, bucket (the water is so astringent, so binding upon veracity), the
author of that deep, pure serial, is carrying confusion into the ranks of
the tipplers. He reminds me of that beautiful picture of the gallant
fireman, young HIGGINBOTTOM:
“‘Still o'er his head, while fate he braves,
His whizzing water-pipe he waves.'
Not only does he drown a living poet as never rat was drowned, but he
empties his bucket—and all for our glorious cause—upon a new-made
ave. He swamps that bit of earth with the greatest, respect for the

they drink only at the pumps of life, they are therefore guiltless of its

OCEAN TWO-SHILLING POST.
WILL it be believed that the postage of a
letter to the Baltic is 2s. ; that this is the
sum charged for a few lines from home to a
common sailor: that so much has JACK to
pay for a line from his old woman, or his
young woman, or youngsters neither women
nor men as yet? You expect JACK to be
always at his Post; to stick to it, to die at
it if necessary; you require JACK to maintain
all these relations to his Post, and yet you
fix your Post in a ratio of 2s. to him. “Come
two to one” is a defiance hurled at the
enemy in one of DIBDIN's sea-songs; and it
will doubtless be repeated by every one of
NAPIER's naval heroes; but that is no reason
why you should charge two BoB to one JACK.
Moreover, grievous complaints are made that
the Baltic Postman is disgracefully slow,
besides inflicting this tremendous double rap
on the sailor’s pocket. Is it for this that our
income-tax is multiplied by two, and an ad-
ditional copper put on our pewter P_A two
shilling Post is too much for a Post Captain,
to say nothing of a JACK-Tar: and an Ad-
miralty that allows, such extortion to be
practised on British Tars, deserves to be
tarred and feathered.
Shakspeare to the Ladies.
THE Shade of MR. WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE,
late of Stratford-on-Avon, presents his com-

them to a short speech written by him for a

The speech is this:–

IN a Biographical Sketch of a lately deceased

THE SUN AND HIS IMITATORS,
MR. Lowe, of the Highfield Observatory, whose letters
to the Times seem to prove that he possesses the faculty
scribed to some animals of seeing the wind, assures us
that the Sun has lately held a levee, at which five mock
suns, his courtiers, were present. These reflected lights
showed their subserviency, in that, they kept their long
tails, (which we must take to have been their trains) care-
fully turned away from their Lord and Master—a mark of
respect which was the more remarkable as it was shown to
the setting Sun. Doubtless, if the Sun had any spots on
his face, the mock Suns wore patches to be like him, or
induced the rosy-fingered AURORA to rouge their visages
until they equalled his in rubicundity. The Sun is also
said to have sported three rings on this occasion, but as
they very soon vanished, it is clear they were only runaway
rings, and we have very little doubt that the runaway rings
of that evening were matched by the runaway Nox next
morning. ..

cated phraseology—“Cumuli clouds near the phenomenon.

THE SHILLING THAT SIDNEY DID NOT “ BLEED.”
“MR. PUNCH,
“If you please I am a little ‘Blue,”—that is I am a little Blue-coat schoolboy
and
have if you please to complain of Lord Mayor SIDNEY, who owes me a bun and a shilling,
as also to all the other Blues; and I do hope that you will try and get it for me, as six of us
put our halfpennies together every week, and always take you in. So, there's a good fellow,
give a chapa leg.
It wasn't our fault that LoRD MAyon. SIDNEY wasn't elected. I suppose it was thought
better that a real Duke—(isn't he a big one, too?) that wears ared coat and is gone to bleed
for his country, as we say pro patriº mori, would be fitter. As JEM Toggs said—“It was
helmet against tea-pot-laurels against sloe-leaf —and so the Duke got it. But that is no
reason, as I say, that, Lord MAyon. SIDNEY should spit his spite upon us Blues, and not give
us the shilling and the bun, which have always been given, as I heard Monitor CAMDEN say,
from the time, up when Whittington and his Cat was Lord Mayor. Well, I wouldn't be
shabby, I wouldn't, if I was a Lord Mayor. Only a shilling, too, and by rights—(as Isaac
GRESIIAM #º a monitor, and such a
head for arithmetic)—according to the rise of
noney from that time, the shilling ought to
be at least ten pounds—about which there is
some talk among us of §§ Parliament
-at least ten pounds, not but what the shilling
and the bun are all we ask for.
“Please, Mr. Punch, give us a help. And
could you put in a picture of the Lord MAroR
-a, regular cut you know—LoRD SIDNEY
buttoning up his pocket with the shilling
inside of it, and the baker outside not allowed
to bring in the buns, and all the ‘Blues'
about the Mayor—and the Mayor looking
mean, and some of the Blues savage?
“I’m sure you could do this, with more out
of your own head. Do, there’s a good fellow.
Work upon his feelings like fleas, and get the
Shilling and the Bun, for
“Your Constant Readers,
“THE BLUEs.”
“P.S.. If you put this in, we’ll buy two
more copies. I’d almost forgot to say that
some of us are awfully in debt, having—
according to the ancient custom of the school
—spent the ºn; before getting it, which
makes it difficult. owe every copper of my
money, and BILL, RUMMINs has licked me
twice already, and threatens to take out the
whole sum in black eyes. So, dear old Punch,
do pitch into the Mayor.”
- TO THOSE WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.
WITH very pleasurable emotion Punch has
seen a subscription set on foot for our soldiers’
wives and children. Such a cause needed no
eloquence to plead it, and a whole page of the
Times filled with names of subscribers is a
sufficient proof that the appeal has met with a
liberal response. Charitable England has nobly
done her duty, and has become trustee for the
fatherless and widows—as far at least as her
army is concerned.
Nevertheless Punch has still a couple of
questions to ask his readers—he means, of
course, the British nation generally. The first
of these is, Have we no Sailors’ And the
second, Have our Sailors no children?
We are lyrically told, we know, that
“There's a sweet little cherub sits smiling aloft,
To keep watch for the life of poor Jack.’
Nevertheless poor JAck does sometimes lose
his life, evenin fighting against Russians. And
in such case we are not informed by what
cherubic influence his widow and orphans will
be kept from the workhouse. Surely then, with
respect to the subscriptions aforesaid, we ought
to speak with emphasis of the inited Service.
Osten-Sacken Decorated.
The Czar has decorated the General for
his glorious victory at Odessa; a victory
crowned by the destruction of the French an
English fleets, and the capture of their re-
spective crews, now on their way, marching
to the music of their fetters, to Siberia. The
order sent by Nicholas to the conqueror was
the “Order of St. Andrew.” As Nicholas is
said to be fond of a grim joke, why not make it
the “Order of St. Merry Andrew'?”
TRUE TO THE LETTER.
CoNSIDERING the delays that occur insending
out letters to our sailors now on active
service, we cannot help suggesting, as a free
translation of the familiar quotation, Litera
Åcripta Manet—a letter written (for the Baltic)
remains (at the Post Office.)

PUNCH AMONG THE PAINTERS. No. 3.
IN the rooms at last—and recovering from the glare of gilt frames,
and the blaze of scarlet coats and red robes, and the supernatural lights
on ladies' hair, and the dead white and carmine of naked bodies'
Oh for a dewy sward under my feet, green shade and silence about
me, and sweet air to breathe, instead of this blaze of canvasses, this
flush of spring bonnets—this buzz of low voices, and shuffle of many
feet—this villainous atmosphere of carbonic acid gas. What wonder
that my eye turns gratefully to that full-fed stream-bank, where the
water-grasses, and bushy willows, and graceful birches come crowding
down to look at themselves in the still water, leaden with reflection of
the thunder-clouds, from under which the sun gleams out with a
watery eye upon the summer fallows? -
Here is the yery landscape I was praying for; I need not look into
my catalogue to see that it is marked with the name of Anthony.
True, down to the leathern guiters of that lazy old bailiff or keeper,
reclining, careless of rheumatism, by the young man in corduroy, to
whom he has entrusted, his gun, and who, I regret to see, is basely
.."; for a shot at the innocent water-hens. May the dank grass
rtinish them both with aches and cramps, as it, assuredly will, if they
ie there long. The painter has painted nobler landscapes, but never a
truer one, and the aspect of the sky, the character of the vegetation, and
the whole “lay” of the place are faithful transcripts of English nature.
It is true that they lack the slippery conventional dash of MR. LEE,
who writes R.A. after his name, which MR, ANTHONY does not; true
also, that to chasten any pleasure with which the recognition of honest
eyes and minds might reward the painter, the Hanging Committee
have rejected the other pictures he sent-“pour encourager les autres.”
On the same paternal principle, too, it may be that MR. GLAsse's
Desert March has been huº l out of sight over the entrance-door.
But it serves him right. Has MR. ABRAHAM Cooper painted Arabs,
and their tents, and their mares, and their “maidens,”—as I am suré
he calls them—for every exhibition these twenty years, and is he to
be faced out of countenance by a young whipper-snapper, who dares to
put desert ground under his horse's feet, and a desert sun in the sky,
and to fling blue desert shadows over the hot ground—whose Arabs are
“Long, and lean, and brown,
As is the ribbed sea-sand,”
instead of the sleek gentlemen at eighteenpence per hour, with whom
MR, ABRAHAM CoopeK delights, to people the Sahara? At their
peril who dare to attempt, and—still worse—to succeed, in Arab subjects
when MR. ABRAHAM CoopFR is of the Hanging Committee ?
But one word to M.R. GLAsse. Why paint Coeur de Lions and
Saladins, when you might paint Abn Youssoufs and Sidi El Hamets 2
Wherein is a March of Crusaders a more kindly subject for the brush,
than a Caſileh on its way to El Caaba; or a Toorkman horde on chappoić
-pardon my parade of Orientalism; but I have been bitten by

subsists in forms as full of colour, and with the actualities of visible
existence about it, to boot ? I am the more urged to ask this question,
because I fancy that I can see, in the Exhibition of this year, that our
painters are beginning to show an apprehension of this truth—that for
Art to be a living thing amongst us, she must deal with subjects and
themes from life, or at least subjects in which the universal life of
humanity is reflected, though the garb and period be not our own. I
hasten with pleasure to note every symptom of this happy change, and
as the pleasantest and most masterly example, I do not need that dense
ring of appreciating lookers-on—every one a critic—to guide me to
MR. FRITH's picture of Ramsgate Sands.
Shake hands, MR. FRITH. Allow me to introduce you to MR. John
LEECH, a gentleman who has been painting in black and white, year
after year, month, after, month, week after week, graceful, true, and
untruth. Suppose that in the midst of all this.lazy enjoyment of
sunshine and sea air, these lounging ladies and flirting widows, an
vacant old gentlemen, and fussy old ladies, and happy sand-pie-making
children, and their suite of Savoyards, and, mountebanks, and donkey
drivers, you had introduced, say some pallid, sickly darling of a young
mother, brought from the reeking city to the sea-side in the faint hope
of bringing back the blood to the pale cheek, and the fullness to the
thin pulse, with the mother hovering about it, absorbed in her feeble
charge, forgetting all the gaiety, and movement round her, or only
remembering it in the effort to kindle interest and amusement in her
ailing little one. By this or some such incident, you might have
supplied the note of human affection which is wanting to make up every
complete harmony of common life, and by help of this the F. and
enjoyment of your full-grown folks and the lusty gladness of your chil-
dren would have acquired a double value. .
Having done so much, however, I have no right to quarrel with you
for not having done more, nor do I mean what I have said in the way
of disparagement or dissatisfaction. On the contrary, I am thankful
to you, and so is the public. May their delight cheer you on to better
things of the same kind. More skilfully rendered common life cannot
be, but you may find deeper themes in it, and chapters that shall
awaken a profounder and more wholesome mood in those who come
to look ºf to admire. -

We must warn the directors, however, against creeping away by
degrees from their original plan of a “cheap opera.” . Already an extra
shilling has been rather suddenly added to the price of one tier of
boxes, and there are symptoms of a small disposition to ape the
“fashionable arrangements” of the other house which, though all very
well at the Opera, par eacellence, are not likely to improve the prospects
of the cheap establishment. An announcement has been put forth about
enforcing the rules as to evening costume in certain parts of the house

The street into which the windows of our club look is more favoured by the boys than any
other thoroughfare in London: for it provides them with the greatest number of never ending
gratuitous amusements. There is not anything, which those who have money pay to see, that
the boys do not in their own simpler style, see here for nothing, The Polytechnic with its
new inventions in science and mechanics is paralleled by the tin locomotives with the cotton-
wool smoke that run up and down the board; the properties of condensed air are shown in
the Pop-goes-the-Weasel pistols—the º, of metals by the penny º with the
hideous red heads and white rabbits’ fur wº who spring out of the *. and the power of
the lever by the company of frogs who are for ever jerking themselves up by their cobbler's
wax'd tails, from the tea-tray. The Kölner Manner Gesang Perein does not amuse its refined
audiences so much as the Ethiopian Musical Union, with its quartette part of banjo, fiddle,
tambourine, and bones, does the boys: they fraternise as freely with the º ELLA, in the
high shirt collar and drugget trowsers, who conducts from the opposite kerb, as the patricians
do with the real director on the sofas at WILLIS's. -
The boys also find their Zoological Gardens (when somebody else gives a penny) in the
Happy Family. There is nothing so amusing in the Regent's Park, as the raven who cannot
balance himself on his perch because the monkey has tugged all the feathers from his tail.

for nothing. There is a huge §. comes occasionally with a moving series of views in front
that forms at once the boys' Gallery of Illustration and Cyclorama and Promenade Concert.
Their Chiswick Fête is the long, barrow of musk, mighionette, and geraniums that pºsses

saw for money at Christmas in brighter dresses in the Pantomime), accompanied by the two
Scotch boys with the b
Fº: such roars, as Mr.
e º “How hard the wind blows!”
And, lastly, no pyrotechnical display at the Surrey Gardens, or Vauxhall ever came up to
what the boys in our street saw for nothing when the oil-and-colourman's, was burnt down.
Talk of the Panopticon Fountain, with its 97 feet column of water—the great brewery
engine that night sent its jet above 120 ! The boys again had the best of it. -
ut they were never so much in their glory as they were in this street, on the evening
of the Queen's birthday. (May they grow up to men, and still find pleasure in the same
anniversary.) We had a crown, and a V and an R-all in good old-fashioned variegated
lamps; not that flaunting, flaring, flashing, º flitting, flaming, fluctuating, flutterin
affair, that somebody said, on the dingy fronts of the houses, º looked like a diamon
rooch on a dirty man incorduroys—but the device of infancy and Vauxhall, and the Crown
and Anchor ball-room of the days when we went to fairs. The boys lingered about the street
day long, and we could observe from time to time they criticised the arrangement
from the pavement opposite. But the excitement began when the oily man arrived with
the ladder to light up. By that mysterious communication, which acts with some subtle
and unknown influence amongst street children, they began at once to assemble. Our
attention was first called to the fact, by a troop of six or seven, who came out of a cºurt in
marching order, singing a measured chorus of “Ba-bal-loonſ Ba-bal-loon! Ba-bal-loon?”
There was no balloon in the air to evoke the cry, as we had sometimes, seen, on summer
Mondays. But there was, we imagine, a link with a “gala”—(what is a “gala” practically,
ipes; and there is not a “screaming farce” at any theatre that
Punch, when after a severe chastisement on the back of his head
-
beyond an additional gallon of oil in some old
lamps on an older device?)—and this was enough
to excite enthusiasm.
The first boy who came was a sturdy chap
of six. He had no jacket; and his trowsers, the
feet of which began where their normal knees
had originally been, were kept up, in a wonderful
manner, by half a brace. He took possession of
the high kerb-stone against the foot of the lamp-
#. and there he sat. It was his private box.
he “omnibus” party next arrived. They also
occupied the edge of the pavement, with their
feet in the gutter; but they were not com-
fortable. There was a troublesome spirit amongst
them in a comforter, crossed over an ºld feather
º and a º cap, that had been worn
till it was demi-globular in shape, more like a
grey fez without a tassel. . He was, by dint of
superior stren h and the fulcrum of the lamp-
|post, constantly pushing the whole party along
the kerb, as the clown does the bodies of the
º foreign, and constabulary victims in
front of Punch's show. He had learned it from
them. At last, a bigger boy carrying a bird-
cage—who had evidently been expected back
wherever it was, for the last half-hour-pitched
the Glengarry into the road. The owner rose
to get it; the rank closed up, and he was de-
posed. He immediately tried to take possession
of the private box at the lamp-post, and a combat
was the result, which ended in both being nearly
run over by a Hansom, and so dispersed.
An encampment of light infantry was now, set
up, consisting of four street babies and their
nurses, whose united ages might have amounted
to 25. The tenacity of life in these babies was
remarkable. They were pitched about like
school-bolsters prepared for a match; and thrown
over the . like Scotch plaids; and let
fall on the paving-stones; and dragged, up, by
their one arm, andº ill-treated; but
kept up a wonderful hilarity through, it all,
trying to clutch their nurses' noses, and dig out
their eyes, and crowing and laughing, and suffer-
ing from indigestion, and wanting their noses
blown perpetually.
All this time the lighting up went on to the
admiration of the audience: and at last there
was a very good “House.” But the want of
incident in the spectacle soon began to be appa-
rent. The boys got restless, and quarrelsome;
we saw the wisdom of the French Government
in constantly keeping the people amused. They
bothered the babies, and commenced such wantom
and unprovoked attacks upon the weaker powers
as the EMPEROR of Russia might have been
proud of. At last when a star at the corner flared
up all at once, in gas, they gave a cheer and ran

the instability of public favour, which is all very
well tilla brighter starrises, and the old favourite

Perfect Abandonment.
Nicholas complains, in his St. Petersburg
Journal, of certain expressions, being brought
up in judgment against him, which were never
intended seriously at the time, but were simply
thrown off in the freedom of conversation, and
the unguarded familiarity of gentlemanly," aban-
don.” In our opinion, “abandon” is the very
expression best suited to the case, for, as con:
strued by the words and acts of Nicholas, it
means the entire abandonment of “a Gentle-
man,” which is precisely the fault he-poor
injured Saint—is accused of.
GALLANT Souls—The Militia regiments have
evinced so much spirit that to give it employ-
ment they are going to be embodied.

RUSSIAN COOKERY.
NDER this head may be
included three dishes ;
one provided expressly
for the Czar; another
prepared for discussion
amongst Foreign Minis-
ters and Consuls, and a
third done up for the
swallow of the Russian
Fº The dishes al-
uded to are so many ver-
sions of a story: as for
example, that of the bom-
bardment of Odessa. We
subjoin samples of these
concoctions. They are
all addressed to NICHO-
LAs; but—
The First is Private and Confidential.
“SIRE,-With the greatest regret I have the honour to inform your
Majesty that, in revenge for a shot or two fired on a flag of truce, all
the works of this town have been bombarded and utterly destroyed by
the enemy's steamers, with the exception of the commercial mole.
The shipping protected by the mole, and the town itself, were unac-
countably spared; but all the vessels of the Imperial mole were burnt.
The powder magazine has beenblown up; seven hundred men have been
killed, and three times that number wounded. I have the melancholy
satisfaction of assuring your Mº I did all in my power to avert
the º but, the men were shot down at their guns; and, I am
sorry to add, had to be pricked up to them, by the swords of their
officers. I may, however, congratulate your Majesty on the blunder
committed by the enemy in sparing the commercial mole and the city;
which latter was occupied by soldiers, the inhabitants having all fled.
“OSTEN-SACKEN.”
The Second is Diplomatic.
. SIRE,--The allied fleets of France and England have bombarded this
city and its defences, on the groundless pretence of our having fired on
one of their boats carrying a flag of truce. anks to the valour of
Your Majesty's § troops, whose loss. has been small, the
invaders were repelled after inflicting some trifling injury on the impe.
rial works, and a fortunately inconsiderable amount of wanton damage
on Qur peaceful city. . Nothing could equal the courage of the brave
soldiers, except the fortitude of the faithful citizens. These, during
the bombardment, º the churches, imploring protection, for
themselves, and pardon for their enemies, who, schooled by the chas-
tisement which they have received, will, it may be hoped, hesitate in
future to attempt the crime of spreading devastation and slaughter
amid the pacific dwellings of commerce. “OSTEN-SACKEN.”
The Third is Intended for Home Circulation.
“SIRE,-Again, by the favour of St. Nicholas and the blessing of
ST. ALEXANDER Newski, a glorious victory has crowned your
Majesty's arms. -
“The combined French and English fleets, men of war and steamers,
numbering a, thousand sail, have bombarded Qdessa for forty-eight
hours, providentially with no effect but the displacement of a #.

belonged to a Jew, and of a Latin Church.
“Qur loss, amounts to two men killed and five wounded. , Seven
hundred of the enemy's ships have been sunk, and two hundred set on

Thus, in Russian cookery, the dishes served to the Emperor are plain;
those dressed for ambassadors and diplomatic agents are more spicy:
and the richest and most highly seasoned are composed for the common
8. Simple, viands are esteemed a luxury, and nobody but the
zar tastes truth au naturel.
HALF-AND-HALF JUSTICE.
A Police case reported in the papers of the 18th instant seems to :
us to contain far too ; a joke to be lost. We therefore willingly
secure it immortality by insertion in our columns. t
One TIMoTHY Reece, a tailor, but described nevertheless as “a tall
powerful fellow,” was charged with having brutally assaulted his wife,
an elderly woman with grey hair.” The outrage is thus described by
the policeman:-
“The woman was stretched upon the ground, and the man, who was holding her by
the legs, was in the act of throwing her out of the room. "The moment he caught sight
of me he ran back into the room and slammed the door to. I turned the woman over, and
found she was perfectly senseless, hermouth full of blood, and her tongue, which was
quite black, was protruding two inches from her mouth. insid her herº in my lap for
about a quarter of an hour, during which time I bathed her temples continually with
cold water, by which means she at last came round, and the landlord of the house then
carried her to his own room. I then saw that her face was fearfully bruised, her eyes
both confused and swollen, and in the passage I found as much grey hair as I could
hold in my hand. She complained of great pain also in her side, saying that her
lººd severely kicked her, and she expressed her intention to give him into
custody.
On the trial, however, the wife showed (as usual) “an obvious
anxiety to screen the prisoner” and alleged that “she could not re;
collect anything that happened to her, except that she fell down, and
struck her head.”. The prisoner had likewise a convenient forgetful-
ness, and “remembered nothing that occurred, except that his wife
came home, and fell down.” He could not, however, deny the recol-
§§ of having had “a month's imprisonment before for assaulting
is wife.”
Upon this the decision-judgment, in any sense, we cannot call it-
was as follows:–
*MR. D'Eyncourt.—I have no doubt whatever that these injuries upon your wife
have been inflicted by you, but the evidence is not sufficient to justify me ſº:
the law into full force against you, and I therefore sentence you to be committed to the
House of Correction for three months and kept to hard labour.”
The “full force”, of the law in such offences as this is six months.
imprisonment, with hard labour: not too strong a dose in any case, and
especially not in one like the present, where there had been a previous
conviction. But as the outrage was not, in his opinion, fully proved,
MR. D'EYNcourt was unwilling fully to sentence. He therefore split
the difference, and let the prisoner half off. -
This idea of giving half punishments for half-proved offences certainl
appears to us both novel and ingenious. If the precedent be followed,
We º: a plea of “half guilty” will be shortly introduced; and in
cases of murder, where the crime is only half proved, the criminal will
be sentenced to be only half hung for it. “Never do things by halves”
is obviously not one of MR. D'EYNcourt's legal maxims. Still we
should advise him for the future to try and give rather more decided
decisions. For ourselves we have certainly but little taste for that
udicial half-and-half which it seems is now served at the bar of the
orship Street Police Court.
STEADY, CABMAN, STEADY.
It appears, that, the cabowners and cabdrivers of the Metro-
polis, irritated at their cruel persecution by the public, who insist
on cabs being clean, cabmen civil, and fares à la carte, ſhave been
zealously organising a subscription avowedly designed to º the fines
and other expenses to which owners or drivers of cabs may be subjected
by conviction of breach of the law. - -
Very good. But when cabmen conspire, Parliament men must
combine, and MR. FITzRoy will probably be requested to introduce
the following brief Act into the House, and get it passed before the
receSS:
TITLE.
3.n Att to amend an Act made and passed, &c., and commonly
known as the New Cab Act.
PREAMBLE.
... the above Act, Magistrates are empowered to inflict
º, enalties on those who break it. And whereas this won't
o: Be it enacted as follows:
I. Such power shall be abolished.
II. In all cases of convictions under the said Act, the sentence
shall be Incarceration, with or without hard labour. -
III. (Interpretation Čause). This Act shall be interpreted with-
out any nonsense; and if there be a doubt, the prosecutor is
to have the benefit of such doubt.
Possibly this hint may have the effect of stopping an ill-advised
subscription, against which Mr. Punch strongly cautions entlemen
who have the temporary honour of being his coachmen.

PUNCH AT THE PLAY.
“THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE,”
At the Haymarket Theatre, is a positive success. The piece will not
limp, a few nights, but run very many. Very deceptive to the un-
sophisticated in the ways of playhouses are the glories of first nights.
The curtain descends to a thunder of applause: sometimes, it is true,
like the thunder of Festus, it is “buttered thunder.” Cries for the
author, eries deep as human sympathies, and loud as lion's lungs, demand
the appearance of the magician. The wizard who has waved his wand
for the last two or three hours, stirring men as housewives stir gruel,
is called for to be worshipped and stared at. He is demanded, as men
would shout to behold a i.e., phoenix. That gifted creature—
after a decent interval—comes forward! He is only a man after all.
The audience subside somewhat from their adoration upon credit;
almost convinced that the author is human, even like themselves. The
author bows—once, twice, thrice; according to his capacity for
atitude, and retires into chiaroscuro, whither in two or three nights
he is º followed by his piece. This, nine times and three-
quarters out of ten, is the supplement to a first night's triumph. Of
all the primal thunders of applause, there lingers not an º loud
enough to wake a weazel. A few, few nights and the whilom rapturous
author has only memory of the one night to console and strengthen
him. “The author bowed from his box!”. This, at least, is something.
It may, haply, make a line in his epitaph, winding % with “full-
º jiapason,” the strain of posthumous praise—“He bowed from
as boar.
The Knights of the Round Table is from the French; how much, or
how little, we know not. ...But a piece-that piece, we hear, but make
no affidavit to the fact—disembowelled from a French moveſ and called
Les Chevaliers du Lansquenet, was in the May of 1850 fashionable at the
Ambigu-Comique. #. piece has been naturalised by MR. PLANchf,
the hero of a thousand like, graceful conquests. We had rather that
the Knights had been lawful issue of English pen-and-ink; nevertheless,
they take to the climate very kindly. We know there is a sort of
critic who thinks every play on London boards, all the better, if
originally raised in Paris; to him comedy, like claret, can only
grown in French soil. Now we should have thought none the worse
-haply, alittle better—of the Knights (sharpers and swindlers all), had
they been downright English BARRINGTONs, and not CLAUDE DUVALs.
Nevertheless, MR. PLANCHE has made out for them very excellent
letters of naturalisation with befitting emblazonments, as becomes
united Pendragon and Rougedragon.
The plot is capitally tangled and capitally unwound. It is now all
full of knots, and now, one clear thread. The characters are many.
There are the “knights”—sharpers and swindlers. A broken-down
gentleman becomes teacher of the horn and the small sword. . A young ||
country gentleman, hearty and generous. Aheroine—stolen by gipsies
-who is slowly developed through many difficulties into a countess—
and a mantua-maker, simple, though not as starched, as quaker muslin.
Now all these are shaken together; again shaken; again and again, and
at º take their proper places and meet with their exceeding great
but due reward. At the end Captain. Cozens staggers with Tom
Tittler's sword through his body, and Perdita and ; and Poplin
and Tom Tittler are in a way to become man and wife and to live happy
ever after. -
The Haymarket company is not a strong one. Let flattery do its
best or worst, and even flattery could not coolly say as much. Never-
theless, MR. Pinsch; has been fortunate inasmuch as all the parts
have so fallen as to be well fitted. The hero of the drama is truly,
Tom Tittler—the ubiquitous and potent Tom. He drops down a
chimney with the aplomb (we may twitter French on such an occasion)
of a #. sweeper, and by means of rudest poker, disarms the
hang-dog Smith, cunning as he deems himself at fence. Bucks.TONE
was ripe as a ripe peach in Tom; turning just as sunny a face upon all
things. His words, too, came with a flavour of richness that, at times,
had withal a rare delicacy. Take, as a bite of the peach, the scene in
which he declares his love for Perdita, and the manner in which he
digests her refusal. , MR, WANDENHOFF's Captain Cozens is all to
nothing his best effort in the modern drama. ld, subtle, venomous,
he seems as though he lived on snakes; a swindler whose syllables
are drops of poison. Another phase of scoundrei is the Šiº of
CoMPTON. Our contempt of the knave is, a great deal of it, merged
in forced admiration of the constitutional coldness of stomach with
which, he swallows his wine, prepared aſorethought, “with heroic
magnitude of mind,” not to pay for it. He is penniless; but he is
eat in his poverty: he has consumed a most luxurious dinner, and
e dimly smiles with the sense of a successful thief. His stomach is
no other than a place for marine-stores, and he is proud of his last
acquisition. He is a swindler with a great serenity. . W. FARREN
very micely discriminated the character of Sir Kali Bootle. There
was the true country air in the young, man just of age, who had not
been in London “since he was in short coats.” He wants what
ractice will give him, self-control in scenes of pathos and deep feeling:
§: he promises to be a good actor: and we hope, for his own sake and
for the name he bears, in the fulfilment of the promise. Little CLARK
—the cherry-stone comedian, for upon the smallest cherry-stone he will
always cut you something comic, defined, and sharp-had to do very
little as Dick; but, as usual, made his deep, incisive little mark. Miss
Reynorps was pathetic and natural as Perdita ; and MRs. FITzwiLLIAM
by turns blithe, cordial, and tender-hearted, with her varying fortunes.
The drama has been carefully produced. The scenery very good;
the more especially a view of Hampstead (which SIR THOMAS WILsoN
never shall build upon). . In a word, The Knights of the Round Table
have come very seasonably to the Haymarket, and we have little doubt
will play the town out, of a large amount of money; though with this
paradox—the town will be the gainer, whether it stake for gallery, pit,
stalls, or boxes.

TYPOGRAPHY HALF-SEAS OVER
It is stated, by those who have happened to hear a tipsy
person s that intoxication produces a peculiar º
on the voice. Judging from the imitations of this with
which we have been favoured, we should say that the sub-
joined orthographical. curiosity conveys a very accurate
idea of the pronunciation of inebriety.
“The comparison is so obvious that it disposes of the whole question,
and rebuces the disvute ad absurdum. The only proper way of dealing
with the difficulty was to insist, not on privileges and exempions in
favour of a particular religious sect, but on she immediase revocasion of
she whole order of proscripsion. These dissinceions of race and of creed
are precisely she cause afanachy and weakness so Turey which a juss
and solerans Governmens would seek so efface, by placing every class
of she Fº under she prosecsion of she law, common âlike so all;
and, ifºs be realy she insension of she French as well as she English
Governmens so convince she world shas ses power of she ossoman
empire can be mainsained and regenerased, is is inconsissens and
unwise so humble she Ministers of she Sulsan by demands and shreass
which shey cannoseisher resiss or obey wish safesy."
We were aware that intemperance occasions unsteadi.
ness of the hand. But we did not know that it produces
aberrations of that member precisely corresponding to the
slips into which it betrays the tongue. 3. however,
appears to be the case from the above extract, which we
are sorry we cannot regard as an assemblage of mere typo-
º hical errors, fortuitously expressing speech influenced
y liquor. We are afraid we must regard it as the actual
result of excess. It is faithfully copied from the Rothesay
Mail, wherein it occurs in the course of an article
copied, from the Times. It does not appear as an
isºlated passage, presenting itself with that abruptness
which would indicate a sudden attack of insanity, but is
led up to by a gentle gradation of words mis-spelt; thus
suggesting that the compositor, like most people who in
toxicate themselves, exemplified the proverb, Nemo ºpente,
&c.; and did not get so very bad all at once. Spirituous
liquor was probably at his elbow, and it would seem that
the character of composition thence resulting developed
itself in proportion as he got on with his toddy; the term
whereby the Scotch, we believe, denominate whisky and
water; a mixture that, in all probability, constituted
our friend's beverage.

TIGHT I, ACING IN THE ARMY.
HE press occasionally
favours us with an
estimate of the number
of female lives that
are sacrificed to tight
lacing ; but we wish
that somebody would
furnish particulars of
the º arising
from tight lacing in
the army. Effeminacy
is not now a failing
with which our officers
can be charged, but
the military practice
of tightening the waist-
band to a most un-
comfortable degree, is
less adapted to the
stalwart wearer of the
coat of mail than to
the slim occupant of
the p. female.
We hear sad accounts from the seat of war of gaunt guardsmen
fainting under the effects of tight lacing; and though there may be
something interesting in a delicate young creature."going off” into a
sufficient amount of swoon to justify the tender application of smelling-
bottles and Eau de Cologne, there is a melancholy absurdity in the idea
of a brawny Coldstream requiring a sprinkling of iced water on his
mahogany §º. and having his lungs relieved from oppression by
ºpplication of a stout pair of shears to rip up the seams of his
acket.
J Another grievance under which our army is groaning, or, rather
gasping, is the Regulation leather stock or black choker, which takes
Our gallant fellows by the throat in the most violent manner. It may
remind the soldier of the ties of home, to have his neck encircled by
one of those ties, the wearing, of which is the stiffest job, he has to
perform on parade; but though it is desirable that the soldier should
never bend the neck or bow the head to the enemy, it is a pity that
apoplexy or suffocation should be the occasional price of his erect
attitude. If our troops are left to faint under the tightness of their
cravats and jackets, a whole regiment, instead of being able to “sup-
port,” “carry,” or “recover arms,” will be obliged to use their best
º in “supporting,” “carrying,” and “recovering” one
another.
The Doctor's Pen-Wiper.
Doctor RAFFIEs—the papers tell us—was recently arrested in Italy
for having “in his writing-desk a pen-wiper which assumed the sha
and colour of a cockade.” We hardly think this the true cause of the
Doctor's arrest: it no doubt arose, from a philological blunder. The
authorities may have considered the pen-wiper as a venomous, mortal
article; and for this reason: in Italian there is no W: hence, for
Pen-wiper, the sagacious authorities read Pen-Wiper.
ANTIMONY FOR THE RUSSIANs.
THE Correspondent of the Vienna Medical Journal on the left bank
of the Danube states the number of sick in the Russian camp to be
very great. We hope that the Russian forces before long will all have
had a sickening.

OUR CRITIC AMONG THE PAINTERS, No. 4.
“AND so.” (exclaims M'GILF, grasping his maul-stick with an energy
of protest that makes it shiver in his hand), “you would restrict art to
subjects of common and contemporary life! By what right-in virtue
of what principle—do you presume to shut me out from the Past, with
its picturesquer forms, its brighter colours, its freer and more stirring
life, untrammeled by our multifarious laws and conventionalities,
its, wars and processions, and pageants, its passions and its faith?
Why am I to turn from achieved history to history in progress?”
Softly, my dear M'GILP—I lay down the same law for both the
past and the present. I but insist upon it that your pictures shall
reflect life, and record some action, passion, emotion, or affection of
men and women of a kind to awaken some answering thought or whole-
some emotion in my mind. Do this, and I do not care if your subject
be taken from Regent Street or Smithfield, A.D. 1854, or the Palace of
EsAR-HADDON, at Nineveh, B.C. 780, or the Colosseum of NERO,
A.D. 84, or Fontainebleau in the days of FRANCIS THE FIRST, or the
Battle-field of Hastings, at the downfall of our worthy old friend
HAROLD. But inasmuch as minds which can apprehend the actual and
the familiar are more common than imaginations which can call up the
departed and give life to the past, so I believe that for one painter who
can perform the latter achievement, there are five-score that could
attain, at least respectably, to the former. But now, I find the five-
score vainly essaying the work that only the one has thews and sinews
for, and, in all probability, that one employed on the work that the
five-score could not utterly fail in.
Moreover I prefer the present to the past, for the yery reason that,
as its forms and outward garnishings are less tempting and splendi
so the painter, in treating it, is likely to be urged more to inwar
significance and expression—to be led from the coat to the man,
from the tailors' work to the Creator's. And thus his picture must,
I conceive, become nobler and loftier, more worthy of a man to do,
and of men to contemplate. Remember, too, that subjects from con-
temporary life are not necessarily unmeaning or trivial subjects.
These, whether of past or present, are always unfitted for art, º
they be presented with the texture of a TENIERs, or the finish of a
BREUGHEL. Neither are subjects of even the commonest life neces-
sarily vulgar. Take HoGARTH, for example, and see how, by infusing
intention into his action, and expression into his faces and figures, he
dignifies the lowest theme, and gives us pictures which are books.
What I say is this; that, while you painters seek only, or chiefly,
after the pleasing and the picturesque, you are degrading yourselves
wilfully into mere sense-ticklers, and that the likeliest way of lifting
you out of this spreading slough is to bid you look at the world round
about you, and to find what in it affords scope for presentation informs
that will speak to men's thoughts through their eyes... You quote
to me the case of the old painters, how they treated themes that were
not contemporary, but chiefly events from the legends of the saints and
martyrs of old, or the life of him whom the saints worshipped and the
martyrs died confessing. But look how they dealt with their subjects.
Not with an antiquarian parade of the outward semblance of the time
and place where the events befell. No-they worked with the materials
round about them. The Sea of Tiberias was the nearest lake; the
street of Jerusalem a scene in Florence or Ferrara; the men and
women—apostles, or saints, or spectators—the painter's friends and
contemporaries. . And so they got true life into their works, while we,
travelling to Palestine for models, skies, architecture and costume,
bring back something utterly, bare and barren of all life whatever.
º painted the heart of a subject; we paint its shows and seemings.
And because of this, I say again, that I rejoice to see one painter here
and there venturing away from the past into the present.
I do not for all that wish for more of such pictures of the time as
that ancient Associate MR. Hol.IINs, for example, gives me. All I can
say is, that his present is better than his past. But as he puts no more
mind into one than the other, 1 can derive from him only this negative
satisfaction that at least he is not now aping imagination, but honestly
parading his want of it. He is painting what he sees, though what he
sees is not worth hº at all,
But when MR. Hunt gives me such a picture as The Awakened Con-
science, I feel that here is a man who º: some purpose of
art in the world beyond pleasing my eye. I see a courageous determi.
nation to face one of the rifest evils of our time, and to read all of us
youth a terrible lesson. Some tell me he has not succeeded—that his
moral is obscure and his story unintelligible. I can only answer, that for
my part I wish both were more of a riddle to me. I believe the main
reason why this noble work and MR. Hunt's other picture of The Light
of the World have met with comparatively little sympathy is, that
most of us have ceased altogether to look to pictures for any deeper or
stronger meaning than the mind can catch at a look. We have no
notion now-a-days of the painter preaching us, a sermon. What
business has he, whose best purpose, in the ordinary conception, is
to cover a given wall-space agreeably, to be knocking at our hearts
or awakening our consciences?
Knock on, HENRY Holman HUNT, for all that. Tell us more home-
truths. Set us face to face with our great sins again and again. , Still
paint our MAGDALENEs, scared by the still small voice amid their bitter
splendours, mocked in their misery by the careless smiles and gay
voices of their undoors.
Which of us is not the better for that presentation of the woman
waking from the dream of sin, meant not É. the tempters only, but
for the sisters of the tempted and the fallen? y should our
Exhibition lift up no voice to brand abominations against which the
hard stones of our streets cry aloud, night after night? -
Not that Art need dwell with pain, either. She may enshrine the
çommon affections, as in those loving ºf..." of CoPE's, where a
father's fondness has guided the painter's hand. She may pleasantly
whip our social follies and shams, as O'NEIL has done in that picture
of The Jury, where the deaf, and stolid, twelfth man sits, like a rock,
|amid the clamour of his indignant brethren, locked up without meat,
drink, or firing—candlelight excepted—to agree upon their verdict.
Or she may sweeten the simplest little passages of life, as WEBSTER
does in that village child, who shares her breakfast, with the expectant
dogs;, or in those two works of MR. Hook's (worth, acres of his
Venetian º: and Brides, and Banquetings) the Rest by the Way-
|side, and A Few Minutes to wait before Twelve o’Clock. these a
|painter I always thought among the most conventional of a conven-
|tional school, has risen to truth and tenderness by contact with nature
as, he knows it, everyday life, and homely affections. None of these
subjects are unworthy of a painter: for all read some lesson, or awaken
some thought, affection, or emotion, in the spectator. I would mention,
also, a rou º; painted and homely canvas, of Presbyters visiting a
Willage. School in Scotland. The name of the painter, STIRLING, is
unfamiliar to me. The picture is hung in the Architectural Room, and
excites, probably, little attention. But there is the heart of a man in
#: the hand of a painter, not masterly yet, but that will do better
lings.
Nor need our artists stay at home, either. But if they travel, let
them return with realities, and give us not such foreign subjects as
MR. Uwins paints, or MR. ABRAHAM CoopFR, but such as MR.
PHILLIP brings back from the streets of Seville, where existence is
still picturesque. His bright and true Letterjºriter of Seville has
found a buyer in the QUEEN, who, I am ºd to learn, has become
mistress also of FRITH's Ramsgate Sands. I congratulate HER
MAJESTY on both her investments. -
An example of what thought in the painter can do for a simple and
poor subject is to be found in an unpretending little performance (with
a new name—E. DAVIs,) which hangs near the door on the left as you
enter the West Room. It is called Meditation, and represents an old
yillager, with a six days' beard, sitting by a lonely fireside, the light
falling warm on a face gently saddened with old memories. 'You'ma
build many a simple life-story out of that face, but I defy you to loo
at it and not see that the painter had some such story in his mind. The
painting too, has all befitting technical merits to set off the homely
pathos of the old man's gaze; and if any kind friend were to offer me
my choice between this two-foot canvas and some more ambitious
work not very far off, I know which I should choose.
MR. LESLIE, who rarely turns out anything_that has not mind and
meaning in it, has º a Rape of the Lock, very eful and
courtly; but f would rather have that charming face which he has
painted (under the title of The Present) looking in quiet satisfaction at
a locket. I would have said, a miniature, but that I think if it had
been a miniature, there would have been more of a flush on the cheek,
and more sparkle in the eyes. It is very lovely; and, when I recall a
head about the same size, which he exhibited last year, and was
imprudent enough to call Juliet, I am thankful he has not given any
more distinctive name to this most winsome young lady.
DOUBTS ABOUT DRESS. BY AN OLD SOLDIER.
I HAVE known a good many military messes, but I doubt if in their
clothin *uation, some of our colonels have not made the greatest
Iness OI all.
. I doubt if trussing their men in such torturingly tight coats at all
increases their activity in active service.
I doubt if it be possible for men to use their arms, when—thanks to
stocks and cross-belts—they barely find it possible to use their lungs.
. As to the stocks, I doubt, if many would not quite as soon be put
in the pillory. And I much doubt the truth of CóLoNEL MARTINET’s
assertion, that to make a good soldier you must begin by throttling him.
I doubt if j ight Cavalry such heavy accoutrements will
be found to make their charges at all more formidable—except perhaps
In a pecunuary sense.
Our soldiers are generally obedient to orders. Yet when a man is
encased in his “regulation” clothes, 1 doubt if it isn't cruel mockery
to bid him “stand at ease” in them.
Granted it be true that pipeclay makes the man, I doubt if the want
of it would not make the fiappier fellow. In fine, I doubt if it be not
possible to dress a raw recruit without trussing him.

A LETTER FROM ANNA MARIA TO JANE HENRY,
ALL ABOUT THE LAUNCH OF THE PRINCE ALBERTAT WOOLWICh.
“My DEAREST JANE HENRY,
“The weather on Saturday last", was lovely. It wasn't too
warm, nor too cold. The sun shone with its usual good nature—as if
it was only too happy, like the best of us, to come out in its very best
to see our dear #. UEEN-and as for parasols, you might have
looked up to heaven all day without the slightest fear of a freckle.
“We started so early, and Papa was very angry because I wouldn't
eat any breakfast. How is it, dearest, that when you are very happy
you cannot eat? I only know, if it had been my weddin -morning, f
couldn't have taken less. We went along very slowly. The carriages
were treading upon each other's heels all the way down. It was from
iondon to Woolwich a perfect crush-room of vehicles. -
“Every one was so polite, so kind, that we had not much difficulty
in picking our way through the Dockyard. There were so many people,
dear, it would have taken you all your lifetime to have counted them.
Every one, too, looked so smart, that though I had on the beautiful
ress, you know, that made the PARKINsons so mad at our last picnic,
still I felt half shabby, and should like to have gone back again to have
put on something better;-but n'importe /
“You couldn't look anywhere without seeing a flag. They fluttered
about in the air like so many pocket-handkerchiefs that were being
waved out of window on some d procession day when KossuTH, or
PRINCE ALBERT, or some dear handsome fellow is going by. Each ship
was decorated with them, and some of the steamers had so many
colours all over them, that they reminded me of that vulgar MRS.
ELMoRE when she wishes to be very fine on a Sunday, and puts on all
her wardrobe.
f : This Letter was written a full fortnight ago—marked “Immediate"—entrusted to
a private hand (MIss Alice Jones)—and the natural consequence was that it was
never delivered until yesterday.—Ed.
“You have no idea what a monster of a ship the Prince Albert is
It is ever so tall, that in looking up to see the top of it, the bonnet
nearly fell off the º of my head. You know the grand stand at Ascot:
Well, I should say that it was full three times as high as that. Round
it were constructed a number of seats, like the firework-gallery at
Vauxhall, and these seats were crowded as on a grand opera night
with the exception that every one was in morning costume, and
cannot give you a notion of the beautiful effect it had
“Papa wouldn't allow me to stop to admire any of the dresses, so I
aul ºr, I cannot send you a description of those that struck me the
most. We went up more staircases than there are in St. Paul's, and
at last, panting and out of breath, I found myself on board the deck.
Oh dear! the height was something terrible; and when I attempted to
look down I am sure I shouldn’t have recognised my own husband.
You may have some small notion of what it was like when I tell you
the bonnets looked no bigger than bouquets, and as they were all
huddled close together, they presented the appearance of a handsome
Brussels carpet, with a very †. pattern upon it. -
“I was rather º with the ship. It was very different to
what I had expected. It is certainly very large; so large that, if
Papa had not had on a white hat, I must have lost him over and over
again. It would be a beautiful place for a ball, and I wonder it did
not strike some of the officers to turn the deck to that purpose, more
especially as all the things were cleared out of it. I don't know what-
ever the men will do when they want to sit down, because there wasn't
a chair or sofa in the place. Altogether, I must say the ship looked
wretchedly uncomfortable. ... I didn't notice a .." º and there
was such a terrible lack of furniture that it looked as if the previous
tenants had been moving, and had carried away all their goods. If the
ship is to go to sea in its present state, I can only say that I am

extremely glad 1 am not one of the passengers. I must say, also,
I do not admire much the plan upon which it is built. The stair-
cases are extremely narrow, and very difficult to descend without
knocking your head. The windows, too, are such little bits of poky
things i. I defy any one to look out of them, and besides they
look dreadfully shabby without blinds or curtains. One curious
thing which surprised me exceedingly, was that they had only a
balcony at one ...} Why not have a balcony all round? or you would
imagine, if they had a balcony at all, they would have it in front of
the ship, whereas theirs—dear JANE, don't laugh, darling—is right at
the ...} But it was evident all through that they sadly stood in need
of a woman's superior taste to put their place to rights. The men are
sad stupids at these things. And this is most incredible, if I had not
articularly noticed it, they have not a fireplace in the whole ship.
º hatever will the poor creatures do in the winter? It’s terrible to
think of it; but, however, it is just as well perhaps that they have no
fireplaces because, they haven't a single chimney. Did you ever hear
of anything so ridiculous?
“The Prince Albert, I am told, has been built with all the newest
nautical improvements introduced on board, and I suppose the absence
of any ropes and masts is one of them. However, I will not allude
further to this, as I confess I do not understand much about such
matters. A large covering was over the deck when first I went in ;
but, as i noticeſ this glass lid was taken off afterwards when we were
in the middle of the river, I suppose it was only put up as a kind of
awning in the event of its raining, and so far it was very kind of the
dockyard people, very kind.
“We heard the people shouting down below, and the sounds of the
different bands playing God Sare the Queen came to us every now and
then in soft gushes of loyal melody; but as for seeing anything, one
might as well have been locked up in the nursery at home ! The
bulwarks—for that is the stupid name they give the walls on either
side—are so high that one ought to have been on horseback to have
looked over them. We were told the QUEEN had arrived; but bless you!
as for being able to convince ourselves of that interesting fact, it would
have been as easy for you to have seen the whitebait swimming in the
water. I cried out, that it was a shame, and vowed I would leave the
boat, but they stopt me, and said that not a soul was allowed to go on
shore, until she was fairly off. Off, indeed! I had a good mind to leap
off then and there, at once, only I was afraid of hurting myself.
“All of a sudden I heard a fearful hammering, as if a hundred thieves
were trying to break into the . I thought of you, darling JANE,
and regretted that I had not made a will before starting, leaving you
all my jewellery, and letters, (with a request that you would burn
them), as well as my beautiful new glacé silk dress that has not yet
been sent home from MADAME JUPON's. I clung to papa, but instead
of comforting me, he only told me ‘not to be a little silly.” The
knºcking was repeated, and seemed to come from right underneath, the
cellars. It continued for full five minutes, and then there was a dead
calm, more terrible than the noise, and I expected the ship would
explode, and that I should be shot like a rocket right over to |. other
side of the Thames. I Y. off my bracelets, i put them into m
pockets to save them, when my attention was distracted by a man wit
a big voice ºi. to “every one on board to run about the deck.’
This was done, I heard some one say, to shake the vessel—just as if we
had not had shaking enough already! I implored the º: to remain
quiet—not to make a noise, or else we should all go to the bottom
—but they wouldn't, dear, Hthey would go on, tramping round and
round the vessel, singing and Hºl. all the while, as if it was the
finest fun in the world. How I hated them—and what names I called
them quietly to myself
“Tout d'un coup—in less time than it takes to fill a glass of cham-
pagne-cries were raised of “She’s off ' ' I didn’t know where she was
off to--or where we were likely to go to—but at that moment, dear, I felt
as if I would have given all I was worth—even down to dear Julius'
portrait—to have been outside an omnibus—a market-cart—an alli.
gator's back-anywhere but where I was 1. However, the people shouted
—and cheered—and the band played Rule Britannia—and everything
round me seemed so safe and happy, that, instead of going down upon
% knees, I conquered my fears, and, with the quickness of the Post
orn Galop, became as co lected as if I were befºre my looking-glass.
The sensation, dear JANF, was very delightful—though necessarily very
brief. I felt something like the same tingle on that occasion in the
i. i* when I thought the Captain was #. propose to me, and
he didn't. It was a feeling of great, ecstatic, thrilli g, soul-lifting happi-
ness, such as I have experienced sometimes when winning at cards. I
recºllect the last time, when we played at vingt-et-un, and I won four-
and-sirpence at one sweep, that the same warm, exhilarating glow shot
through me, and I regretted that life was not made up entirely of such
pure, unadulterated moments of divine joy. It was heavenly. This
sensation—and I never shall forget it, dear, any more than my first
yalentine—compensated me for all the previous fright; and when
I looked round, I discovered we were, strangely enough, in the middle
of the Thames., Here, another fear alarmed me, for Í didn't know
where they might be taking us to, and I trembled lest I might be
*-
carried off to the Baltic to fight the EMPEROR OF RUSSIA; and I
hadn’t, dear, as much as a pair of scissors with me.
“The scene was very enlivening; at least, what I saw of it, for I do
not mind telling you in confidence, my dear JANE HENRY, that it is the
greatest mistake, if you wish to see i. to go aboard of the vessel
that is launched. As for seeing, you see nothing. You are locked up
in a great big vessel for four or five hours; they will not let you go,
whether you don’t like it or not, and you remain all that time without
anything to eat or drink, unless you are wise enough to take a basket
of provisions with you. Next time, I will take good care to secure
a seat in one of the firework galleries, and I shall be quite content
in being a spectator, instead of a stupid actor in the scene.
“There were not many ladies on board, and it was lucky for them,
as we were not liberated until half-past three o'clock, and then we were
carried ashore in brown-paper boats that I should have been ashamed
to put a kitten in. Only think, dear! I had been on board ever since
eleven o'clock, I had come away without any breakfast—and as there
was no lunch, no refreshment, not even a Captain's biscuit, (J don’t
think they had as much as a Captain on board) to be had, you ma
imagine how hungry I must have been, and with what an appetite
enjoyed iny dinner at the Trafalgar.
“The above is all I saw of the Launch, for in plainspoken melancholy
vérité, I saw nothing. -
“Oh! the Prince Albert is called ‘a screw.” I looked for it on the
deck, and everywhere, but, the only evidence of the screw I could find
was in the absence of the luncheon. Wasn't it mean?”

THE MENDICITY SOCIETY'S FESTIVAL.
| HE Mendicity Society is doing

ºvºy || - day, last week, which reports
the annual meeting of the
Society, held on the Satur-
day previous, whereat it was
shown, that this excellent in-
stitution had relieved a large
amount of distress, and had
effected the punishment of a
great mass of roguery.
It is very uncertain that
you are doing any good by
* giving alms in the street, It
- is very likely you are doing a
great deal of harm. , Bestow
your charity by subscribin
to the Mendicity Society, an
you may be sure not a far-
- thing will be thrown away.
Moreover, when pestered by
the usual importunities, –
“Gentleman, will you be so
kind,” &c. “Give a poor bo
a'apenny—do Sir, please Sir,”
&c. &c.; “Kind gentleman,
pily a poor distressed creature,” &c. &c. &c., you will enjoy, in giving a ticket instead of a
coin, not only the sweet satisfaction of knowing that if the applicant is really necessitous,
you are helping him; but likewise the satisfaction, almost equally sweet, of reflecting that
you are dishing him if he is an impostor. - -
As the detection and punishment of dishonest mendicants constitute not the least important
of the Mendicity, Society's uses, it may be suggested that the success of its efforts in this
direction should be exhibited in some striking manner to public notice. Thus it would
º more particularly to that class of persons whose philanthropy is chiefly interested in
the protection of society from fraud. For this purpose aJ. of a novel and interesting nature
might be held annually. - -
At the anniversary of the Association, which, with the co-operation of Government, shºuld
be celebrated in a conveniently spacious locality, all the rascals, º: and vagabonds, which
it has been the means of bringing to justice throughout the year, s ould be publicly paraded,
with their heads shaved, wearing brilliant prison uniforms, and having the description of their
several forms of imposture pinned on their backs. After which, under a º shed
erected for, the occasion, they should all be set at work on so many treadmills arranged
in a row; thus forming a spectacle somewhat of a nature of a fancy-bazaar, to which the public

The objection may be raised to this scheme that it would destroy any ... of self-respect
that might be remaining in the minds of the prisoners. But in wretches who are capable of
living in laziness by practising on the hearts of the charitable, and thereby doing all they can to
harden them against real misery, every spark of that virtue is extinct. Especially is this the case
with the base and disgusting begging letter-writer, interspersing his abject affectation of pathos
with methodistical cant. The sound whipping of a number of these dirty knaves might almost
form a pleasing feature of the entertainments at the Mendicity Society's Exhibition.

A good band should also attend to perform a selection of music, including, of course, that

VICTORIOUS ROME I
The Inquiry into the Conventual Institutions Bill has been abandoned —thanks to the
allant ºpº. of the Irish Brigade, in combination with Ministers—to the majority of the
ouse of Commons. . No doubt the Bill for regulating the Disposal of Property by Nuns
will either share its fate, or be thrown, out. This is as it should be. The Holy Priesthood
of Rome is letting the British Public know that it means to keep the government of its
institutions to itself, and that it will not allow them to be subject to the law of the land.
But the Roman Catholic Clergy must not stop here. At present every one of them is
amenable to the jurisdiction of the secular courts. Though an Archbishop, , or even a
Cardinal, he might, if charged with a criminal offence, be tried, as if he were a layman and
a heretic, at the Old Bailey. This disgraceful servitude can no longer be endured. The
alieged misdeeds of ecclesiastics of the §. of Rome must be left to be dealt with entirely
by their own tribunals. In short, the Roman Catholic Church must be placed above the
law, as it very soon will be with Mr. GLADSTONE to promote its views on the part of the
Cabinet, and with such a friend in the Liberal Party as MR. BRight.

MR. GRIEVE'S NEW SYSTEM OF WARFARE.
ERSONs who like seeing a
war without being stunned
by the noise, or blinded by
the smoke, can see it to their
great ocular satisfaction at
the Gallery of Illustration in
Regent Street. There they
will find themselves on the
field of battle, winning vic-
tories by the half-dozen: it
is quite a new system of war-
fare, that the most timid
need not object to. A child
§ go into the thick of it
without crying—a lady can
look on smilingly, and not
have recourse once to her
smelling bottle—and wefancy
a member of the Peace So-
ciety, even, could brave the
horrors of a war iike this,
without fainting. It is in
truth, war, rendered not only
perfectly safe, but deliciously
agreeable. , Quakers might
join in it without doing any
violence to their feelings—
and Bishops, having seen it
would be sure to recommend
other Bishops to take their
daughters to the beautiful
scene of innocent slaughter.
There is no occasion to
get out of the way of the
cannon-balls, for there is no
shot that passes beyond the
small one you pay at the
through an entire campaign
doors for admission. By this new system you are enabled to
in half an hour, and when you leave you are no more tired than UNCLE ToBY was after he
had been going through one of his wonderful sieges in the garden. In this way you assist in
bombarding Odessa, and are present, at all the grand engagements of the Turks, whom you
cheer on with your sympathies, and hope they will not leave a single Russian alive to chant a
Te Deum over all the test. In this same easy, comfortable manner you sail with the Allied
Fleet, the French and English ships, big and small, mixing joyously together, like boys in a

eneral for half an hour when he runs no risk of being bayoneted or shot? It is MEssRs.
. and TELBIN, who, by their new pictorial system, have achieved this pleasant harmless
Wonder.
To conclude seriously: Few persons have fought so many battles to please the public as
MR. GRIEVE, and we must say that no one is more deserving than he is of the great victory
he has just achieved with his martial brush at No. 14, Regent Street. It is now the duty
of the pºlic to see that this victory is not altogether a barren one—plenty of honour but
no spoil.
WHICH WAY HAS THE MONEY GONEP
DRURY, LANE THEATRE has been more than once connected with the interests of the
wives, widows and children of the British soldiery. Many years ago, when a late magnificent
lessee was rolling about the stage as #.] in a death-struggle with Richard the Third
-the gallant Harry and the crook-backed tyrant being both of them excessively drunk-
the manager suddenly staggered forward and appeased the rising anger of the audience by
announcing that the “proceeds of the next night’s performance would be devoted to the relief
of the widows and children of the gallant fellows who died at Waterloo.”. Whether the
widows and children profited by the result nobody ever knew, because nobody took the
trouble to inquire. In these days people are rather more inquisitive, and some º are
º: to ask what has become of the proceeds of the Fancy Fair which was held not long
ago under distinguished patronage” at Drury Lane Theatre, for the benefit of the wives
and families of our soldiers in the East. -
e stalls were numerous and well supplied with those previous gimcracks which fetch
almost fabulous prices, from being dealt out by fair and delicate fingers, which are not too
delicate to clutch any amount of money that is offered, or too fair to accept the most extra-
vagant prices for the most trivial articles. Nothing happened to mar the éclat of the whole
proceeding, until impertinent curiosity has commenced . rather pertinaciously, “Which
way did the money go?” The LoRD MAYoR knows nothing, except that the LADY
MAYoREss took at her stall the sum of £52 13s. 4d., which has, no doubt, been handed over
with Prºpe: }..."; but, as the LADY MAYoFEss did not keep “the only booth in, the
Fair,” it follows that, if there was anything really “fair” in the business, there must be a
large sum to be collected from the other ji. rs.
uriosity, seems to grow stronger for want of information, and the appetite of the public
for a promised statement of results has been rather whetted than allayed by an intimation
that “as soon as the accounts are made up they will be handed to the committee for
publication.” We do not see why there should be any difficulty in making up any account
of simple addition, though the delay may be ex-
Slained if any subtraction or long division has
een resorted to. We recommendall the ies
concerned, if they value their own credit, to
furnish without delay the information which has
|been called for, and the absence of which might
warrant the insinuation that the fairness of the
fancy fair has been of an entirely fanciful or
imaginary character.
THE NAPIER COLUMN.
(From the Times, Tuesday, January 11, 1905.)
WE are happy to say, that at last the NAPIER
Column is in course of completion. Yesterda
the fourth bronze, representing the gallant and,
we rejoice to say, still hale old Adimiral, directing
the storming of St. Petersburg in 1854, was fixed
in its place on the pedestal. There is still much
to do before the work can be finished, and those
who are old enough to remember the burst of
enthusiasm which the news of the storming pro-
duced in London, the illuminations, the re-
joicings, and the thanksgivings in St. Paul's,
sometimes wonder that upwards of fifty years
have been allowed to elapse, and yet the
memorial is incomplete. But such is the way
in England, and the venerable BARON NAPIER
(some day, it is whispered, to be raised even to
the dignity of a Wiscount) must not murmur.
Wiscount NElson, the nation's idol, died in
ificent of sea triumphs, in
y reference to our files of
, we find, that in May,
1854, the year of the St. Petersburg victory,
the Trafalgar Column was incomplete. But
BRITANNIA is solvent, and may be allowed long
credit for her debts of gratitude.

THE PUNCH SHELL.
MR. PUNCH has the honour of submitting to
the Ordnance Department the idea of a new
Shell—he means a bomb and not a jacket. This
Shell, instead of being charged with gunpowder,
is to be filled with }. combustibles, con-
sisting of the daily and weekly newspapers; and
also with numbers of Mr. Punch's own periodical,
which those whom Mr. Punch has aggrieved or
exasperated are welcome to say would render the
missile a heavy infliction: to whom Mr. Punch
may reply, that at least it would not be, heavy
enough to break certain persons' heads. Replete
with authentic intelligence and just remarks, our
shell is to be projected frºm an enormous mortar,
and pitched into the middle of a Russian city,
if possible without hurting, the inhabitants.
Bursting with its fall it would scatter its con:
tents in all directions, and by real facts and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TWO MINISTERS
IN ONE.
E hear that the Minis-
ters have at last come
to the conclusion that
even a Secretary of
State cannot fill two
places at once; can-
not, in fact, be at
the same time the
Minister of War and
the Minister of the
Colonies. A cleverer
man than even the
DUKE or NEwcasTLE
might fail in the at-
tempt to have one
foot in the old world,
and the other in the
new, for no man can
be his own antipodes.
It is, however, rather
- hº º:
"T.I…azºrs the way in which the
--~~~~~~~ *º Globe endeavours to
--~~~~-º ~~~~ show that although
it is, expedient to
separate the offices of War and Colonial Minister, there is no one
but the Duke of NEwcastle who is fit for either. We are told that
if we take from his Grace's hands the º: of the war, we
shall find out the difference at once (though by the way we should
not object to a change), while if we were to remove the Duke from
the Colonial office, everything would be in such a mess that we should
§. miss the discretion and tact, which brought about the great
Tonor case. -
According to the Globe, it appears that the Minister entrusted with
the conduct of the War and the Colonies has shown such consummate
statesmanship with regard to both, that it is utterly impossible to spare
the Duke from either of the posts he has occupied. We can only say
that if NewcastLE were to be rather powerfully hauled over the coals,
the bestowal of the sack might not be altogether a matter of so much
difficulty as the bland and benevolent Globe seems to anticipate.
OUR PRIZES TAKEN FROM THE FRENCH.
ALTHOUGH Partant pour la Syrie and Rule Britannia are alternately
played by English and French bands; although the tricolor and the
meteor still fly and flap lovingly together, Mr. Punch is happy to
say that the bellicose spirit of º has not entirely evaporated;
but that certain bold Britons, in defiance of the mamby-pamby ethics of
peace-mongers, continue to regard a portion of the French as their
natural enemies, and therefore take everything as soon as it ventures
to appear. The English º that lie before us ought to be en-
circled with woodcuts of laurels; with the British Lion griping the
Gallic Eagle, and compelling the bird about to be translated into
another sphere, to drop its every quill. We shall, for the pardonable
purpose of gratifying the patriotism of play-goers in general, allude to
a few of our recent victories.
Knights ºf the Round Table (late Les Chevaliers, de Mansquenet),
gallantly taken by ADMIRAL PLANchf. of the White. A well-builtship,
with a clean run from fore to aft. She answers her helm admirably,
and has never yet been known to miss stays.
The Married Un-Married; Faust and Marguerite; captured under
the command of Vice-ADMIRAL CHARLEs Kean of the Blue.
The first is a very cranky craft; but by careful trimming of canvas, so
as to catch the º puffs, has held her way.—The second prize can
scarcely be called sea-worthy; but the rottenness of her timbers has
been hidden by paint, and the whole craft pitched so very strong, and
her hold so º: with brimstone, that condemnation has been
stayed awhile. The sooner however she is broken up, the better for
all aboard of her.
The Marſ' ſear', 'cºptured by the gallant CAPTAIN CHARLEs
Selby, K.C.B. (Knight Commander of Bumboats). She is rather a
heavy sailer; but on the whole a good sea-boat; and answers her helm
very well.
The First Wight, taken by CoMMANDER Wigan; a French egg-boat
that, by means of good seamanship and proper ballasting, now sits as
light as a sea-gull, and now rises like a flying fish.
These are only a few of our prizes from the French; but they still
*ttest the courage of the hardy tar-translator, who will never lay down
his British goose-quill whilst the enemy has a single craft, even though
upon paper.
DRINK AND DULL SUNDAY.
We understand that great, alarm, is felt by certain brewers and
ublicans lest the ºf and intellectual recommendations of the
rystal Palace should generate a conviction that it would conduce to
the welfare of the population, if that place of rational and innocent
recreation were allowed to be open on Sundays.
At Glasgow and other places in Scotland, where there are no
excursion trains or steamers, to take the labouring classes out of the
smoke into the pure air on a Sunday, it is well known that a vast
consumption of beer and grog takes place on that day, which the
majority of the inhabitants celebrate by getting drunk, insomuch that
those who are excluded from the rail and the river, commonly enjo
themselves in the kennel. , Thus the Scotch observance of the Sabbat
conduces greatly to the ºf: of the liquor trade.
This consideration renders the parties above alluded to earnes
anxious that any movement tending to unclose the gates of the Crys
Palace on Sundays should be suppressed, and they will feel y
obliged to any pious persons who will join them in resisting all
suggestions to that end, in a quiet way. They do not want to get up
a noisy agitation on the subject, lest that should have the effect of
occasioning the pot-houses to be shut up on Sunday as well as the
Crystal Palace, which would be worse than merely having their bars
and their parlours thinned by the sober attractions of that edifice.

FINAL PREPARATORY WISIT OF MR. PUNCH TO
THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
(From the Court Circular.)
MR. Punch sº by Mrs. Punch, and attended by Toby, paid
a visit to the Črystal alace on Monday last, in order to make a final
inspection of the building, and, by special command of HER MAJESTY,
to report as to its probable readiness for the reception of the QUEEN
and the nation on Saturday the 10th of June.
Mr. Punch was conducted through the building by SIR JOSEPH
PAxton, to whom with his Highness's usual affability, he was pleased
to .. himself in terms of condescending encouragement, so grace-
fully balanced between cordial recognition and unalloyed approbation
as to produce the happiest effect upon the mind of the auditor.
Mr. Punch then selected the site which it was his intention tº
occupy, during the inauguration, stating to SIR Joseph that he had not
deemed it necessary, although solicited, to take part in the ceremony.
He was the godfather to the edifice, having originally invented and
conferred, upon it the title of the CRYSTAL PALACE; but he should
leave to his friend the Archbishop the entire solemnities of the day,
including an announcement which DR. SUMNER had most kindly under-
taken to make, namely, that at the special instance of the QUEEN,
arrangements would be at once effected for opening the Palace, on
Sundays. This announcement Mr. Punch said would immediately
Hºle the anthem, “When the Poor saw Her, then they blessed
er.
Mr. Punch then accepted from the gentleman in charge of each
department a small memorial of the visit—a cube of mosaic from
Pompeii, a spangle from the Alhambra, and a feather from one of
MR. I.AYARD's bulls, being among the articles. The curator of the
antediluvian reproductions also insisted on Mrs. Punch's taking away
an Ichthyosaurus giganticus, as a trifle for her nursery.
The same evening Mr. Punch made his report to HER MAJESTY. It
was marked by the lucid brevity which characterises all the compositions
of his Highness. We have been favoured with a copy.
“MADAM,
“It will do.” “PUNCH.”
THE SCHOOL OF SOLDIERSHIP.
WHAT makes British soldiers so valiant in fight?
Oh! their lips being shaved and their belts being white,
And their heads being cropped and their stocks being tight,
On these things their courage depends.
The reason for which they in battle prevail,
Is having coatees cut so short at the tail,
And so narrow as by a large measure to fail
Of coverings to answer the ends.
Their charge is resistless; and wherefore 'tis plain.
By taking their epaulettes off in the rain,
And preserving them free from a speck or a stain,
Their courage is kept spotless too.
'Tis quite beyond question undoubted and clear
That men who with pipeclay are forced to besmear
Their trappings and straps º: divested of fear,
y being compelled so to do.
TEETOTALISM AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
A deputation of teetotalers last week took their melancholy way to
the Crystal Palace, to remonstrate with the Directors against the reso-
lution to vend to visitors the abomination of wine and beer. The
deputation moreover expressed a very º against the statue
of Bacchus; which, at the suggestion of MR. STURGE, was decently
covered with a suit of drab, j the god's vine-bound head surmounted
by a broad-brimmed hat...This slight improvement of the antique was
merely adopted to show the purifying and reforming spirit with which
teetotalism would invest the mischievous incitements of Greek art. A
muslin cap (the authenticated property of the late HANNAh MoRE)
has been sent for the acceptance of the VENUS DE MEDICis.
A PRETTY SAFE PROPHEcy.—There is but little doubt, before the
War is over, that the EMPEROR Nicholas will find all his roubles
turned into troubles.

The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell.”—Walter Savage Landor.
IN THE SHELL.
Aye-press it to thine ear, till confusion growing clear,
Thou canst read the mingled voices that fill its womb of war;
Hoarse sounds of fierce commotion, like the distant roar of ocean,
Drowning sobs mixed with hymns as of devilish devotion,
Sabres clashing—houses crashing-
Horses’ hoofs at gallop dashing—
And the thunder of great guns from afar.
And thy pale cheek warms with life at the melody of strife,
And thy firm lip is clenched firmer, and thy knit brow sterner grows—
But hark!—what hush is creeping o'er that mad sound onward
sweeping?
And then upon the silence that burst of bitter weeping!
How it swelleth ! how it knelleth'ſ
How of broken hearts it telleth'
Cursing thee up to Heaven, as it goes!
Hark again to those faint groans !—the fever-stricken moans
Of victims that are fattening the dank Dobrudschaplains;
And mixed with that low moaning chaunt of full-fed priests intoning,
By the side of the Almighty their Autocrat enthroning.
And now, nearing, English cheering,
Blent with French—unwelcome hearing,
And a clank—as it were falling chains.
Hark, still, unwilling ear, as nearer and more near
War's music from the North blends with roaring of the sea. .
Ha! knowest thou that thunder? 'tis thy forts that topple under;,
Broadsides that shake the piles of St. Petersburg asander,
And strange noises, like the voices
Of a people that rejoices
To be conquered into freedom by the free!
Clash of prison doors wide flung; bursts of joy in Polish tongue;
Frantic greetings, as of those who ne'er thought to meet again;
Hearken yet, with chaſing patience, to those hymns of up-risºn nations,
On whose throat thy hand hath pressed like a vice for generations,
And the clamours of the hammers,
And the levers and the rammers,
That are hurling great Dagon to the plain!
MAJESTY OF THE CIVIC SENATE.
How delighted LQRp CAMPBELL, who loves the LoRD Mayor and
the City, will be to find that the civic dignitaries are behaving as such,
º taking a dignified line! Witness what occurred at a recent Court
of Aldermen; whereat, according to the newspapers,
“The Lord Mayon informed the Court that he had received the report of the
Commissioners of Corporation Inquiry from Lond PALMEaston, in which report it
was suggested that the Court of Aldermen should be totally abolished.
“A dramas WIRE moved, without making a single comment upon the contents,
that the document be referred tº the committee or Privileges,
“The motion was carried unanimously.”
In this abstinence of the Aldermen from all remark on their enemies'
proposal, what a sublime expression was there of silent contempt It
is really quite Roman, and may be considered to evince the spirit of
the Capitol rather than that of º There is every reason
to believe that the Committee of Privileges will recommend the
Fathers of the City of London to follow the example which they seem
to be taking from a memorable act of the Corporation of the Eternal
City, and that the Civic fathers will adopt the recommendation. Should
the abolition, of their Worshipful Court be determined upon, the
Aldermen will make a grand effort of passive resistance against the
execution of the decree... Clad in their scarlet robes, and wearing the
insignia of their office, their Worships will assemble in their Hall of
Legislation, and taking each their respective seats, await the approach
of the envoys, appointed to command their dissolution, in solemn
silence. The RIGHT Honour ABLE THE Lord Mayor, also attired in
full costume, and sitting in his chair of state, will preside over these
venerable men. To heighten the solemnity of the scene the images of
the immortal GoG. and, MAGog will be placed upon pedestals at the
back of his Lordship's throne, from above which they will frown down
upon the intruders with indignation and astonishment. Awed by the
impassive countenances, and profound gravity, as well as by the tre-
mendous bulk of the civic magistrates, and overcome by the fumes of
sacrifice ascending from the altars of their turtle-ary deities, it may be
expected that the . will decamp with consternation, and
report the utter impossibility of carrying into effect the mandate for
the extinction of a senate consisting of such reverend persons.
LADIES IN RICH ATTIRE.
NDER the head
of “Fashions for
June,” Le Follet
mentions
* A third robe of
white taffetas, with
large cheques in vari-
ous shades of blue."
Wehave heard of
a ladies having thou-
sands of pounds on
in the shape of
jewels, but now it
seems they have
carried therage for
valuable ornaments
tothenitchofwear-
ing large cheques.
o draws these
cheques we should
like toknow; if the
papa of the wearer he must be very kind: if the husband, a miracle of
generosity. A dress decorated with cheques would be a catching dress
in a ball-room: but anheiress must have few natural charms indeed to
stand in need of such embellishments. By a rich but ordinary widow
they might be worn with propriety and wisdom, if it is wise ºn the
part of such a party to marry; and indeed she might year nºtes as
well as cheques, together with gold and silver coin. But, although
a lady cannot have her pocket picked of the money which is outside
of her dress, we think that, for º she had better put it, in her
pocket than stick it on her skirts. Otherwise, a dress of which the
ornaments were cheques would have this advantage, that no capital
would be sunk in those ornaments; so that although they would
render a costume rich, they would not make it equally extravagant.
A BIT OF A SEE.
An account of the ceremony of inducting the new Bishop of SAIIs.
Bury on Wednesday last week, mentions that among otherformalities
of that proceeding,
“Here Mn. Alroad dug a turf from the field, and delivered it to his Lordship as
seisin of the temporalities of his see.”
Last, Wednesday week was the Derby day, when the turf would
naturally be uppermost in the minds of the generality of people, but if
this was the reason why M.R., ALFoºd presented the Bishop with a
iece of the substance so called, it was º an extravagant act of
lorse-worship. To present a man with a clod of earth before a number
of people must, greatly embarrass the recipient of the gift, as he could
not eat it, might be considered ungracious if he threw it away, an
would hardly be able to put it in his pocket. What is this for? is the
§. that might naturally have been asked by the Right Reverend
relate; and his Lordship, who, perhaps knows something about
singing birds, may have conjectured that the gentleman who gave him
a turf intended it for a lark,

It is sometimes asked, What would be the consequence if ladies
were eligible to sit in Parliament? One result of admitting individuals
of the fair sex to vote in the House of Commons, might be to increase
the practice of pairing.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

RE-DRESS FOR THE ARMY.
WE are ºg. to announce a sudden and decisive fall in the Stocks
of the British Soldier. Our army may now be quoted at its full value
without those dreadful coupons which threatened to cut their heads off,
and in an affair of desperate valour, in which all would be “neck or
nothing,” they will no longer be likely to be reduced to nothing by the
stiffness of their necks, .
We appreciate the desire of the authorities to give the soldiers re-
dress for their grievances, though we suspect that, but for the dressing
that has been administered to themselves, the authorities would have
delayed still longer the step they have at last taken. We do not quite
approve of the mode suggested, for covering the deformities and dis-
comforts of the military head-dress, by turning the bear-skin cap into
a sort of bolster, and putting it into a pillow-case. Such, however, is
§: the plan adopted, for MR. SIDNEY HERBERT informs us, the
soldiers
“Are to be decorated with covers for their helmets and shakos, composed of white
linen, for the protection from the heat.”
We do not see why because we are fighting on the side of Turkey
our soldiers are to be made to resemble “the turbanned Turk; an
we suspect that it would be better to adopt a new hat of lighter
material, than attempt to get rid of the inconveniences of the old,
by adding to its bulk as well as its unsightliness. We shall have
almost as great an objection to our soldiers displaying on their heads
the white dishclout, as we should to their showing the white feather.
A “ROW IN THE BUILDINGS.”
... WE can scarcely regret there having been “no house” on Tuesday
in the Commons if, when a house is made, there is nothing better to be
done than that which took place on Thursday night, when there was a
regular “row in the buildings” devoted to the sittings of Parliament.
LoRD John RUSSELL and MR. DISRAELI went at it “hammer and tongs”
—an expression which we should think must own “ninny-hammer and
tongues”, as its most appropriate origin. The scene, was almost as
discreditable as an affair between “the Slasher” and “the Nobby one’”
for the benefit of “the Spider,” or some other hero of the belt and
boxing gloves. LORD, John's hitting was bold and straightforward,
while Tisſºil proved himself the artful dodger of the ring, and put
in a few of his celebrated “nasty ones” with an effect that was truly
disagreeable, if not very damaging. It is to be regretted that, while
blackguardism has nearly lost its patrons in the prize ring, it should
still, amuse an audience in the House of Commons, and while the
“noble art of self-defence” is at a discount out of doors the “ignoble
arts of personal attack” are at a premium in Parliament.
LINES TO THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY.
My old friend, SIR JAMES GRAHAM,
Eh f--what, always the same?
At your old tricks again—oh, for shame, Sir, for shame!
Will you make me re-roast
You to cinders almost .
For your name being once more mixed up with the Post?
'Tis your work and affair
For the Navy to care;
For the Navy; whereon no expenses we spare.
And yet NATIER's brave crew
. Get their letters when due
Some six weeks; if at all: and of course they blame you?
An epistle, if we
Should direct it “Black Sea,”
In the Baltic, most likely, deliver'd would be.
Now, is this not the case?
And can you have the face
To deny that you’ve grossly neglected your place?

WANEERING; OF AN ENGLISH LADY'S MAID IN RUSSIA.
-Edited by RICHARD COBDEN, Esq., M.P. This Tale of Our Times—in
which the sufferings and persecutions of this estimable female, who, on the Decla-
ration of War between Great Britain and Russia, was magnanimously turned out of
St. Petersburg, to find, with one box only, her way to Berlin, where she arrived in
poor health and questionable spirits—this Moving Story will be Edited for the benefit
of the Victim, by Richand ConDEN, Esq., M.P., who in a recent speech so eloquently
ºwelt upon the General Felicity of English Servants in Russia, and of English
Governesses, and English Ladies'-Maids in Particular.
A SENATE OF PUBLICANS.
THE Colony of Victoria has just agreed to a Constitution, according
to which a seat in the Upper Chamber is accessible to those only who
possess property to the amount of £10,000. It is estimated that
the majority of ten, thousand, pound men in Victoria are Publicans,
and it is Jºãº therefore, that the public.interest may be safe in
their hands. There may be wisdom in constituting a Senate of Pub-
licans, who will, probably be in favour of very moderate measures, and
will be disposed to look rather to the spirit than to the letter of the
laws they enact. - -
Some awkwardness may be anticipated in a Senate of Publicans,
many of whom may have odd associations suggested to them by
allusions to the Bar of the House. We can only hope, that when an
Act of Parliament is on draft in the Upper Chamber, or Up Stairs
Room, care, will be taken to draw,it mild. We may expect that a
Senate of Publicans will occasionally be turned into butts by those

IHE TORD CHANCELLOR'S STANDING ARMY.
HATEVER doubt there .#
have been as to the suffi-
ciency of our military and
naval arrangements, there
can be no question as to
the highly effective state of
the officers and men forming
the standing army under
the command of the LoRD
CHANCELLOR. This power-
ful and indeed almost mur-
derous force, seems to be
kept up evidently On a War
footing. It is to be re-
etted that there is no
onger a Court of Review
for such a Court would find
plenty of º: in reviewing the troops placed under the com-
mand of the Chancellor. His staff numbers no less than three
secretaries, three messengers, three bag-bearers, three court-keepers,
three ushers, two mace-bearers, a tipstaff, a gentleman of the chamber,
: a train-bearer, making an effective body of no less than twenty
Olilcers.
When we reflect upon the immense power represented by this body
of well-disciplined men, we may judge of the effect of an attack made
by them all at once on the pocket of a suitor in equity. . However
formidable may be an ordinary corps of rank and file, we all know that
there is nothing so damaging, and indeed destructive, as coming into
contact with the well-known file of the Court of Chancery. - -
We trust that some arrangement will be made to place this formid-
able force at the disposal of LoRD_RAGLAN ; for if any power can
make the EMPEROR of Russia pay for his temerity, it would be such
an engine as that to which we have alluded. Should the Chancery
corps be ordered on foreign service, there are thousands who would
witness its departure with delight, and would feel that if sent, to the
right-about, the power which has been regarded with so much dread
at home must strike terror into the breast of the foreign enemy.
Another Postponement.
THE Government despatches, and the delivery of the Baltic letters,
have been postponed so long in consequence of the war. It has been
felt that they would only tend to agitate and confuse person's minds, if
made public at the present critical moment. Consequently it has been
.# expedient to defer the publication of the despatches and the
delivery of the letters until the war is completely over.
MUNCHAUSENOFF.
FRANKLIN, according to Household Words, thought that bows and
arrows were good weapons, and ought not to have been abandoned.
Certainly if we would fight the CzAR on equal terms, we should have
recourse to the Long Bow.
Great News for Russia.
PoRTUGAL has declared a perfect neutrality in the Turkish quarrell
Are we to be surprised at this? By no means. For how often, eyen
at the best regulated tables, have we found that Portugal has had
nothing whatever to do with the Port in question.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEWSPAPER AT BREAKFAST.
To M.R. PUNCH.
IR,--I am a resident
in Pimlico. We have
various grievances
ism (which involves
bell-ringing at un-
heard-of hours in the
morning,) bad drain-
age (especially close
to the Palace of our
very Gracious Sove-
reign), abominably
slow omnibuses (the
Royal Blues), and
other afflictions. But
one can endure all
these things if one
can get one's news-
paper at breakfast
time. Sir, that is
what we cannot get
in Pimlico.
… breakfast
hour, Sir, is ten

a visit to Brighton (a
very pleasing watering
place), I breakfast at
nine, and '...".

at that hour. ". Pim-
lico, which is some-
what nearer the pub-
lishing office of that journal, it is impossible to obtain it until eleven
twelve, or any other fancy hour which may suit our news-agents, an
their masters, the Boys.
“When you order a paper to be regularly supplied to you, the news-
#. man smiles, and unblushingly assures you that it shall be at your
oor as the clock strikes the hour you mention. - -
“I have made, Sir, a list of the excuses and allegations which, for
the last fortnight ſº is to say, twelve days, excluding Sundays),
have been tendered to me as explanations, why my Times was not
delivered within an hour—two hours—three hours of its being due.
“Monday. The Boy was not sure about the number of my house;
very stupi —all would be right in future.
“Tuesday. The Boy had got fighting with rival news-boys, and they
had taken away one of his papers, unluckily the one intended for me.
“Wednesday. The Boy had left my paper at No. 10, where the gentle-
man refused to give it up, and is supposed to be a mad party, leastways
he swears awful, his servants say. §hat do I care?) .
“Thursday. The Boy reports that both Houses of Parliament sat so
dreadfully late last night that all the papers are late. (This is an
. story, as the Lords do not sit on W. and the Commons
invariably rise at six on that evening.)
“Friday. The Boy forgot his money, and when he got to the place
in the Strand where the papers are obtained, found he had to come
back, as they give no credit.
“Saturday. The Boy had run away.
4. º The Boy, being a new one, . in place of the
runaway, did not know the streets about our neighbourhood. -
“Tuesday. The Boy had knocked, he was prepared to make affidavit,
eleven times, but could not make my servants hear, so went away in
espalr.
“Wednesday, The Boy had obtained his copies of the Times, but,
putting them down in the shop where they were sold, while he paid,
took up, on leaving, a bundle containing nothing but Supplements so
had to go back.
“Thursday. The Boy thought he had understood from my servant
(who went round in wrath for the journal), that I was going out of town,
and therefore supposed it did not matter about bringing the paper.
“Friday. The Boy reports that the Times machine, which prints the
papers, had broken down, and no papers would be out till the middle of
the day. (I should say that my neighbours tell me this is a very
frequent occurrence, and mowise creditable to a great newspaper
office. dly a day passes, but somebody in our street receives this
intelligence, as a reason why he has not got the Times, while other
peºple have.) -
“Saturday. The Boy came home with a statement that in conse-
quence of the Rooshian war and the rise in beer, the Times would not
be published any more. He demanded his week's money, but, I am
here, such as Pusey- .
informed, received more kicks than halfpence, and indeed had his
º confiscated. -
“But, Sir, how do these twelve excuses, the regular ones in Pim-
lico, atone to me for the discomfort of breakfasting without my

“Permit me respectfully to pour my sorrows into your friendly
bosom, and to sign myself,

HOW TO BRING THE WAR TO A TERMINUS.
THE papers are continually describing some new wonderful engine
of destruction, which is not only to annihilate a whole army at one
coup, but in due time to annihilate war itself. The greatest engine of
destruction that we are acquainted with is a railway-engine, and we are
astonished that the English Government has not laid before the
EMPEROR a most elaborate railway plan, stating that they would only
be too happy, if he would but allow them, to cover the whole of his
mighty Empire with railways, free ºf expense. The outlay would,
necessarily, be tremendous, but the gain would be this:—The Armies,
of course, would be conveyed by these railways, and if care was taken
to appoint well tried, drunken stokers on each line it is very clear that
no country, whatever its resources might be, could possibly stand
up long, against such a terrific system of wholesale slaughter. The
war would probably be brought to an end without a single engagement
having been fought, and we should almost feel inclined to forgive the
great loss of life these railway-engines of destruction had been to our-
selves in the consoling thought that they had been the happy means
{ exterminating an enemy so formidable in point of numbers, as

THE PROBABLE END OF NICHOLAS.
AFTER having, through mere obstimate pride, caused the death, in
most cases agonizing, of many thousands of human beings, and brought
wounds, mutilation, and revolting outrage upon perhaps as many more,
including women and children, it is very likely that Nicholas may not
be torn in pieces by subjects, or executed by captors. Indeed, if he
fell into the hands of the Allies, dethronement, probably, would be the
extremity of retribution which it would be thought possible to inflict
on the great Thief and Murderer, who would then be º: the “unfor-
tunate §. &c. We expect that he would be allowed to retire
to this country; where a palace would be provided for his accom-
modation, which he would occupy alternately with a suite of apartments
at the Clarendon, and at the Star and Garter.
Mollified by misfortune, we should then have our friend. Nicho!.As
doing the amiable. He would visit national schools and infirmaries
express interest in the scholars, and sympathy, with the sufferers, and
put his name down for donations to the institution. He would go
over Chelsea and Greenwich Hospitals, and chat with the veterans.
He would subscribe to soup-kitchens and Bible Societies, and now
and then attend missionary meetines He would take drives about
º
s
Windsor and Richmond; and occasionally pull up to relieve a beggar.
All of which doings would be chronicled in the newspapers under the
headings of “MUNIFIGENCE of Nicholas,” or “BENEvolence of
THE Ex-EMPEROR or Russia,” &c. &c. Nay we may live to read
such a paragraph as the following:—
Nicholas AND THE PEACE Society.—The meeting or the Peace Society, which
took place yesterday, was honoured by the presence of the Ex-EMPERon of Russia, who
occupied a seat on the platform between MR. Cobden and MR. BRIGHT. His Majesty
addressed the meeting in very good English, and described in forcible language the
horrors and folly of war; expressing the pleasure he felt at having become a convert to
peace principles.
Lastly, this wortny would die, not in a perpendicular line, but in a
horizontal position: quietly between the sheets of a bed, of which we
should be requested to draw the curtains around “fallen greatness,”
and forget all about the burnings, the manglings, the murders and un-
speakable atrocities. The | of the tortured myriads would have
been long ago hushed; the Te Deum that mingled with, them would
have died away, and we should be invited to join in the destroyer and

A War Minister Wanted.
. It is at length decided that we are to have a War Minister; a
distinct functionary, whose whole mind shall be rolled up in the con-
templation of cannon-balls; whose, every silent thought shall be mute

inister, whose big, belligerent manner shall at once announce him to
the beholder, as-BRITANNIA's Minister at War. Two or three
different persons have been named for, the post: they have, more or
less, their merits: but one name has hitherto been most shamefully
passed over, and that name is—John BRIGHT.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
JENKINS AT A FASHIONABLE WEDDING.
HERE is a season for whitebait, a season
for, oysters, a season for “baked-taturs,”
and there is a season for JENKINs, who is
coming out with a richness of flavour that
will justify our serving him up from time
to time to our readers as an occasional dish
or entrée. We propose to dress him in his
own sauce, and garnish him in his own
artificial flowers. We shall not give the
ublic too much of him, for JENKINs re-
ieved by JENKINs, would be as bad as
calf's head replaced by calf's head.
The marriage of the EARL of DURHAM
and the LADY BEATRICE HAMILTON, fur-
nished a theme recently for the genius of
JENKINs, who sets out by announcing that
“The event which unites the noble houses of
LAMBton and HAMILTON creates ties of relationship
between a number of our most ancient and distin-
guished families.”
We like the majestic mode in which father JENKINs, taking at once
the º and parental characters of º adopts as “ours”, a
number of the most ancient and distinguished families. These families
appear to be raised to an elevation even more than Royal, by the
recognition bestowed on them by JENKINs, who says– -
“It has been our lot to be present at the performance of the hymeneal ceremony,
when the bride and bridegroom represented the very highest families next to Royalty,
and when even Royalty itself attended to do honour to the occasion ; but in no instance
whatever, within our recollection, has the general body of visitors included so large a
portion of the elite of society.”
There was, in fact, such a crush of aristocracy,
“That many noble individuals who, under ordinary circumstances, would have been
accommodated near the altar, had to take their chance in those parts of the sacred
building appropriated to free seats, &c.” |
- - .
We were not aware that, “under ordinary circumstances,” the aris.
tocracy were drawn up into a position near the altar, which we thought
was usually appropriated to the charity children, though we can under.
stand the sympathy J.ENKINs must feel with those who “ had to
take their chance in the free-seats,” a chance to which—after carrying
the Prayer Books to the door of a pew—he must have been often
subjected.
It is clear that JENKINs did not immediately force his way into the
church, for we find him as usual, hanging about the railings, or
occupying, perhaps, one of his ordinary, posts—a lamp-post in the
vicinity. “At cleven o'clock,” he says, “the company began to arrive,”
and for three-quarters of an hour a long succession of carriages were
“setting down.” It is extremely probable that, during these three:
quarters of an hour JENKINs himself experienced “a setting down”
more than once from the police, whose duty it was to keep off the
pressure of impertinent curiosity from the guests at the wedding,
“Some little difficulty,” adds JENKINs, “occurred in marshalling and
disposing of the equipages,” a difficulty which must have made JENKINs
burn to display his abilities in calling up and ordering off the various
vehicles. The narrative proceeds to inform us that
“The bridegroom, accompanied by his ‘best man,’ arrived in an ordinary brougham.
His lordship was not recognised by the public outside, and entered the church
unnoticed."
How is this, JENKINs f There has been an unpardonable omission on
your part, for if you recognised, “his lordship,” a timely shout from
yourself of “Hollo, boys, hollo!” would have at once been responded
to, and your remark on the bridegroom, having “entered the church
unnoticed” would not have been justified. - -
JENKINs and the crowd soon found something with which they
were familiar, for
“The well-known HAMilton crimson liveries were immediately recognised, and the
occupants of the carriages were respectfully greeted by the crowd."
These carriages we are told “consisted of three coaches belonging to
the MARQUIs of ABERcoRN’s private establishment.” We were not
aware that the Marquis had any public establishment of coaches, and
though we have heard of some peers being job-masters on a very #:
scale, we do not believe that in this instance the imputation which the
awkwardness of JENKINs clumsily *:::::: is at all justified.
After describing the contents of the first two carriages, and giving
ºpertinently the age of one of the bridesmaids, JENKINs tells
uls Una
“The last carriage of all contained the infant LADY MAUDE HAMILTON, completing
the interesting, and perhaps unexampled group of six sister bridesmaids.”
Does JENKINs mean to tell us that “the infant” was alone in the
coach P for if such was the case, it is to be regretted that the Chan-
cellor, who has er ºfficio the care of infants, did not appoint somebody
to represent “the infant” on this interesting occasion.
Next follows a burst of admiration in which all the footman declares
itself. The passage ought to be written on plush, in gold lace letters,
with a margin of livery lace, punctuated with aiguilettes for commas,
a couple of livery buttons for a colon, and a cockade for a period. It
runs thus:
“As the coaches decked in the gorgeous paraphernalia—heraldic and emblematic–
which symbolise the honours of “our old nobility, dashed up to the vestibule, the
effect was really grand, and forcibly illustrated the difference between substantial
º”. and the gingerbread glitter sometimes got up for purposes of mere
display.
We should like to know what other “purpose” than “mere display”
was to be served on this occasion, and how the “gorgeous parapher-
malia, heraldic and emblematic,” emblazoned on the paneſs P the
coaches, the harness of the horses, and the liveries of the footmen,
differed from the ordinary quality of “gingerbread glitter” which
JENKINs, for a moment forgetting his shoulderinot, seems to look
down upon.
JENKINs is much struck by the tableau that now presents itself.
“Immediately behind the parents of the bride were the bridesmaids standing in
order According to their ages and stations, and forming a charmingly picturesque
group.
We have heard of a set of “jugs in sizes;” but a set of bridesmaids
“in sizes,” is a novelty that is more appropriate to ordinary earthen-
ware, than to the very aristocratic clay here alluded to. The occasion
appears to have given rise to an effect not unlike a tableau rivant, or a
group at MADAME Tussaud's. We are told by JENKINs that—
“The friends who stood around had, by some involuntary and fortuitous arrange-
ment of their places, so disposed and grouped themselves, as Enconsciously to form a
highly artistic tableau.”
How are we to know that the grouping was the effect of chance;
and may we not presume that a wedding of so much distinction had
had the benefit of a dress rehearsal, with a view to that perfection of the
mise en scène which seems to have been accomplished P. We decline to
follow JENKINs in his personalities, but we must ask—though we know
we shall ask in vain—for an explanation of the following paragraph:
“The features of the venerable Countess of HAddington, crowned with the
reverend honours of age, contrasted touchingly with those of the brilliant beauty of
the younger ladies present."
We cannot exactly see how age can be said to crown features with
“honours,” though .. we know, plays sad “tricks” with the features
of all of us. It is bad enough of jºins to force himself into the his
and staircases of the fashionable world, but it is really unpardonable of
him to ransack the bridal trousseau for the purpose of publishing a list
of the presents given to the bride on her marriage. How the porters
iº him to rummage among the luggage of the newly wedded pair
is quite unaccountable, and the extent of his curiosity may be inferred
from his announcement that “a bracelet inlaid with hair was the
present of the younger members of the bride's family.” The lady's
maid certainly deserved to lose her place for having given Jenkiss
access to her lady's jewel-box. The present, however, that seems to
have possessed i. highest interest for JENKINs, was one to which he
himself had probably been a contributor. It consisted of “an envelope
case and blotting book,” which had been purchased by a subscription
from the wages of all the domestics in Lord ABERcoRN’s establish-
ment; and their young “Missus ” cannot make a better use of it
than to blot out the recollection of the account given by her too
obsequious domestic of her recent marriage.

THE OPENING OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
HE 10th of June, 1854, is
destined to become a red-
letter day in forthcoming
almanacks, and to super-
sede such important and
mysterious . . announce-
ments as Blaise, St. Cºp.
Leonard, or Enurchus in
all future calendars. The
Opening of the Crystal
Palace will be better
worth chronicling than
Rich. Bishop Chich., of
whom mention is made
in our diaries, where the
word Rich prefixed to
Bishop reads remarkably
like surplusage.
Everything smiled on
the morning of the 10th
of June, in honour of the
opening of the Crystal
Palace. The sun smiled
on the chimney-pots; the
oliceman smiled on his
at; even the cabman
smiled on his fare, and
the vendors of spurious
“Guide Books” on the
road to the Palace smiled
in their (shirt) sleeves at
their customers.
The visit of Mr. Punch had evidently been the subject of, much
anxious consideration by the authorities on the line, of road, and
Policeman A1, had drawn himself up—to his utmost height, to look
in at the window of the cab which formed part of our escort.
On arriving at the Central Transept, we at º our cards
(of admission) into the hands appointed to deal with them, and we
immediately “cut in” with our partners. On gaining the interior, we
were shown, with great politeness, the seat reserved for us; but
nobody knew the way to get to it. As it seemed to be fortified by im-
passable barriers, guarded by crowds of officials, each of whom was, no
doubt, in his way a “great gun,” we looked at the taking of our seat
as a piece of business almost as difficult as the taking of Cronstadt,
and accordingly after a little reconnoitring we sat down, as nearly
opposite the royal dais as possible. There we had an opportunity of
ºf the Farnese HERCULEs, who seemed to be contemplating
with calm superiority, the failure of the police in the truly, Herculean
task of keeping back the crowds, every individual of which seemed to
have some special reason for going into some special place, which had
been specially reserved for some other person. In vain was M.R.
SNooks assured that he was occupying the spot intended for the
ARcubishop of CANTERBURY, for MR. S.Nooks had come resolved
to “have his see,” while SMITH was, with difficulty, persuaded to
resign the place of the Prime Minister, into which the physical force
of the masses had, for a moment, carried him. Jones found himself
suddenly occupying the position of the Prussian Minister, and *:::
he was recalled most emphatically by several yoices, it was not till the
police escorted him back to the barrier, that he consented to fill a less
obtrusive station.
The orchestra presented a magnificent blaze of white waistcoats,
producing such a brilliant effect that the dazzled eye sought relief in the
fur collars of the aldermen's gowns, or in the hair of their heads, or any
other object of a soft and sombre nature. Wonderful as was the effect
of the harmony of a thousand voices, there was something so novel in
the harmony of a thousand waistcoats that, for some time, the
spectators seemed wrapped in the bosoms of the orchestra. With the
arrival of HER MAJESTY, whose punctuality is enough to shame half
the clocks in London, and put even the bell of St. Paul's on its metal,
the business of the day commenced.
The presentation of the various Handbooks to the QUEEN, was
chiefly interesting to the assembled multitude for the opportunity it
gave of criticising the various degrees of dexterity with which learned
and scientific gentlemen can go backwards down a flight of steps-a
feat which requires a PROFEssoR. Risley, who perhaps, from this
circumstance calls his gymnastic tricks a “drawing-room” entertain-
ment, rather than a PROFEssor, FoRBEs or a PRofessor Owen. Men
whose lives have been devoted to forward movements, are not well
calculated to take backward steps; and it is no discredit to them that
they failed in a movement of a retrogressive character.
The books and addresses having been transferred to LoRD PALMER-
ston, who never seems to feel that his hands can be too full, the royal
VOL. xxWI.
B B
party paraded the building, and we were glad to see that the QUEEN
took the opportunity of aiming a tremendous blow at the infinitesimal
bonnet mania, for HER MAJEsty wears a real and a sensible bonnet,
while many of her subjects wear a crown—and nothing but a crown-
as a substitute. Of all the º folly and fashion have taken, none
in our recollection has equalled the jº. bonnet-shape.
After the departure of the royal party, the barriers were removed,
but such was the crowd, that even Punch found it difficult to circulate.
The Refreshment Rooms soon became a counter-attraction to the
numerous Courts; but as we sipped some very bitter bad table-beer
price sixpence per glass, we wondered where were the “cheap and
substantial viands” the directors, had advertised. No, doubt every
defect will be remedied, and the thousand, attractions already on the
spot, will be multiplied a thousand times; but even at present there is
enough to see to repay the cost of a hundred visits. e advise the
whole world to get presented at all the Courts in the Crystal Palace,
where every Court that is worthy of the honour, is ably and faithfully
represented.
COMMISSIONER PHILLIPS AND EMPEROR NAPOLEON.
It is all right, at last, with Louis, NApoleon; , The English
alliance has, no doubt, done much for him. nevertheless something
was wanting to fix his destiny. . That something the Emperor has just
conquered, in the admiration of MR. CoMMIssionER Phil Lips, who in
a review of “Napoleon the Third,” speaks of his proclamations, as
“redolent of the spirit [of what spirit did they smell?] of the first
NAPOLEoN, replete with all his fire, and breathing all his eloquence!”
It is said that Louis NAPoleoN is so much touched by the disinter-
ested tribute, that he has sent to MR. PHILLIPs a wig-box, with the
royal portrait painted at the bottom. Moreover, every day the Bar of
the Insolvent Court expect to see their Commissioner enter decorated
with the geranium riband of the Legion of Honour.
A Swim in a Sump.
“A Poor DREssMAKER,” in a letter to the Times, complains that
º!" bathe close to the Serpentine Bridge, over which she has to
walk of a morning. , Her annoyance might be remedied by looking
hard into the sky, or bringing her bonnet forwards in defiance of the
reigning fashion, so that its sides might serve the purpose of “blinkers.”
But this would not lessen the indelicacy of bathing in the Serpentine
near the Bridge, or anywhere else in that piece of fluid that passes for
water: Do the bathers know what it is into which they plunge? If they
did, they would soon renounce all indulgence in a bath which, if dirt-
cheap, is proportionately nasty, and which, though it may not be costly,
ls undeniably sump-tuous.

THE GOVERNMENT POSTAGE-DAMPER.
WE see advertised several “Postage-Dampers,” each
flººf loudly its own particular merit. However, we
think the Government is fairly entitled to the credit of
having invented the largest and most wonderful machine
of this kind, and we appeal to the arrangements for con-
veying letters to the East and the Baltic as satisfactory
roofs that we are not bestowing upon, the authorities at
§ Martin's-le-Grand any praise that has not been most
honourably earned. Could, in fact, any process be more
“damping” than the one they have adopted? They receive
a letter, keep it for some six weeks, and then charge the
poor soldier to whom it is addressed some two or three
shillings for it! This “Postage-Damper” is only capable,
it seems to us, of one improvement, and we have no doubt
that the Government will very quickly availitself of it. The
improvement we allude to is to enforce the Fº: of all
letters to the Seat of War, and to keep them until the
brave soldiers return; that is to say, not to send their
letters at all. Surely if news is worth three shilli
when only six weeks old, it must be much more valuable
when it has acquired the good old age of a twelvemonth or
two. Therefore we would recommend that each letter,
before it is redeemed, should be charged according to the
longevity of the intelligence it contains. Weimagine that
this system, if yº º would prove a most
efficient “damper” to all letters and aii letter-writing.

Idreadful Condition of Scotland.
THE Scotch are in such dreadful want of another Scotch-

THE PALMERSTONIAN SYSTEM OF PENMANSHIP.
IN his justly celebrated character of judicious bottleholder, LoRD
ALMERStoN comes forward with an #!. and advice touching
the employment of its contents. He will have all the Press with him:
for every Editor is too well acquainted with the misery inflicted by
illegible MS. There is, as the noble Lord remarks, a great, want of
proper teaching in the art of writing, and without having lived so long
in the world as to be obliged to wear spectacles or mount a double
eyeglass, we cordially concur in his Lordship's opinion as to what is
proper and improper in that art:-
“The great bulk of the middle and lower orders write hands too small and indistinct,
and do not form their letters; or they sometimes form them by alternate broad and
fine strokes, which make the word difficult to read. The handwriting which was
generally practised in the early and middle part of the last century was far better than
that now in common use, and Load PALMERsron would suggest that it would be very
desirable that the attention of schoolmasters should be directed to this subject, and
that their pupils should rather be taught to imitate broad printing than fine copper-
plate engraving."
...We may say that fine writing is as great amistake in letters as it is in
literature—the chief use, whether of language or characters, is to get
understood. It is a duty to write intelli ; to both the intellect and
the ‘. There are some who, for the § of them, cannot perform
this duty in either of its branches—unfortunate persons!—but he who
wilfully neglects it, or transgresses it, is a rogue, or at best little better
than a rogue; that is, a humbug. There is a suspicious look about
flourishes with the pen; and florid phraseology has a corresponding
expression. By either is indicated a design .. off at least, and in
all show-off there is something of the nature of imposition. Not to go
so far as to argue that a man's moral character may be judged of by his
handwriting, it may be affirmed that a letter well and plainly written is
a letter of recommendation to the writer; raises a presumption at least
in favour of his honesty.
It is to be hoped that LoRD PALMERSTON will publish some copy:
books with all the old texts; “Familiarity doth breed Contempt,” and
the other plagues of our boyhood : newly written, in defiance and
contempt of that effete superstition of light upstrokes and heavy down-
strokes. And we also wish he would open a school in Downing Street
wherein to furnish instruction in penmanship on the Palmerstonian
system. This establishment should be provided with a shop window,
wherein the noble lord shouldFº the testimonials of persons whose
handwriting has been bettered by his, instructions. ese would be
precisely the converse of those which the public is now familiar with,
which exhibit, as the effect of so many weeks’ tuition under MR. So
and So, a uniform dead level of mechanical copy, differing from the
“scrawl,” which they are exhibited as improvements on, chiefly by
having had the stamp of their individuality effaced. In general also
they are much less legible at any distance than the original pothooks;
and therefore altogether considerably worse than these. Accordingly
the testimonials in LoRD, PALMERSTON's window, should consist of
º between handwriting deteriorated and handwriting developed.
s thus:-
1. “This is a specimen of my handwriting after having been spoilt
in six lessons by a common writing master!” and 2. “This is my
natural handwriting restored and amended by one hour's practice in the
system of the Home SECRETARY.”
LoRD PALMERSTON has always enjoyed some º for ability
in Government, and whatever, some people º hink of tha
t, they
cannot refuse him credit for judgment in ruling the public copy-book.
Hospitality in High Quarters.
We are afraid the rumour that DR, WAAGEN is to be fetched from
Germany, and made director of the National Gallery, is too good to be
true, . At the British Museum, for example, we have so very few places
filled by Germans, Italians, and other foreigners, that it would be quite
a refreshing novelty to see some little patronage extended to alien
ability, instead of being exclusively lavished on native talent

OUR CRITIC AMONG THE PAINTERS. No. 5.
It is a great pleasure to find one's own wits jumping with a brother
critic's, sometimes; for there are followers of the craft, whom if I
found of the same mind with myself upon a work of art, I should
conclude I must be wrong. But it is a bore when the other gentleman's
judgment happens to be the first printed, as was the case in the Spectator
of Sunday week, where I found the same pictures which I had
selected for special mention in my last notice, praised to a tune almost
identical with my own. All I can say is, that my notice was in the
printer's hands, though not the public's, before ibe Spectator's, and
that it is a case of coincidence and not copying.
I am proud, I confess, to find my eye and mind taking the same
track as the Spectator's, but I mention the fact less out of pride, or to
deprecate the º of plagiarism, than that my readers may assign
what value they think Piłł. to either of our opinions from its coinci-
dence with the other, "If RhADAMANThus in Punch is infallible, then
MINos in the Spectator must be right; or if MINos be right, RhADA-
MANTHUs can’t be wrong.
Thus, my lord and lady public, W. are quite safe in pinning your
faith on the two of us together. hat you are to do when we differ, I
am at a loss to advise; and I find we do differ on one picture: Ms.
SoLQMON's Second Class. MINos calls it “sentimental”—using the
word by way of disparagement. I, confess that neither from the
picture nor the word can I gather what MINos objects to. It seems
to me, for my part, that the subject is a well-chosen one. A widowed
mother, with her daughter, is accompanying her boy—on his way to
embark for his first voyage. The train has nearly reached its destina-
tion; and from the window of the second-class carriage you see the
masts of the shipping, among which is the craft on board of which our
cabin-boy is entered. The i.Fi. ony of parting has begun to
work in the widow's face; the full tide of grief is setting in the sister's
eyes, and the boy tries hard to gulp down his tears, from shame of a
jolly tar in the same carriage in company with his “old woman,” to
whom parting has grown so common, that she faces it like a stoic,
though she can understand the mother's sorrow still.
This story is intelligibly told. The expression of the heads seems to
me feelingly, faithfully, and not obtrusively rendered. I wish MINos
would tell me exactly what he means by “sentimental,” when he uses
it as a term of contempt, or at least, dispraise. I presume he employs
the word as equivalent to “mawkish,” and if so, Ivow I can see nothing
mawkish in either subject or treatment. The subject is one that
concerns motherly, sisterly, and filial love; and the workings of these
various affections are all shown without weakness or over forcing i

must own that to my mind it excels everything the painter of it has
hitherto produced. Its companion picture, the First Class, pleases me
less. I admit that the old gentleman sleeping in the sunlight, is
capital, but the young lady looks to me affected, and the “gent.” I
fearlessly assert and will maintain to be an arrant spooney. But,
setting aside this difference in our verdicts—MINos and myself are
of one mind—as to the pictures chosen for chief praise. The truth is,
I believe that we both seek for the same things in a picture, and that
there are so few pictures in the Exhibition in which these things have
been principally aimed at, that no two men looking for them can miss
them. What these things are, I must leave you to gather from all I
have written or may write upon the subject of the year's pictures.
Among the painters who this year have º: new strength by
touching their mother earth, I ought to have enumerated. FRANK
Sto.NE, who in the Old Old Story (which he has been telling, in every
variety of costume this many many a year), has got quite a revived
and fresh character by using his brush to paint men and women in
picturesque, real chasses, at #. instead of models in masquerade-
suits out of Wardour Street.
.There is, one work left for notice which aims higher, both in the
º of the subject and the scale of its presentation, than any I have
yet alluded to—I mean MR. E. M. WARD's Picture of Argyle's Last
Sleep. Except his Marie Antoinette in the Temple, MR, WARD has done
nothing so good as this. To be sure, there are still his unpleasant
technical mannerisms, blackness in shadows, flickering lights, untrue
in themselves, and cutting up his masses in a way very destructive of
dignity, and even effect to my eye; the conscience-stricken Lord of
Council is unnecessarii bilious, and too tremendously remorseful even
for such agony as is indicated in the story quoted in the catalogue;
the turnkey-characteristic and national as his face is-does not come
out from the door in substantial flesh and blood. But, after all, ARGYLE
sleeping his calm sleep, is the crowning piece of the work, and that
personage is nobly and feelingly represented. The likeness is true, as it
ought to be in a work meant for a page of the Painted History of England,
that is to cover the walls of the K. Houses of Parliament. The ex-
pression in head and limbs tells unmistakably of a mind at ease,
anticipating restful death in deep and dreamless sleep. The acces-
sories—watch, Bible, heather-sprig, and paper with last thoughts—
are well chosen, and placed to help the sentiment and point the story.
Had all the picture equalled the left hand part of it, very few English
pictures of its class would have been so good—still fewer better." As
it is, with the defects (for such, they appear to me) which I have men-
tioned, I feel glad and proud that this work is destined to be hung
in a place befitting historical pictures. What need to talk of Stan-

the catalogue or on the walls, at once and, as it were, instinctively?—
to point out merits that everyone recognises? For the same reason I
will say nothing of MR. GRANT's simple and manly portrait of LoRD
John, or of his massive head of T. B. MACAULAY.
I have intentionally forborne to speak of MR. MAGLISE's picture.
I respect the thought and courage, visible all through it, the painter's
mastery of hand in details of drawing, and his honest and conscientious
elaboration. But the work leaves me unmoved, unaffected, unim-
ressed. I neither feel the horror of the slaughter, nor the grim
irony, of the bridal. Any raptures, I might throw myself into over it
would certainly be insincere; any disparagement I might give way to
would deserve to be called impertinent. Who can fail to see that the
strength of no common man has been put forth on that vast canvas?
Before I venture to judge it I should wish to see it hung in some vast
Gothic hall, where, in rivalry with painted glass and bright tapestry, it
would, I believe, have an #. and significance which here, amid the
crowded and garish commonplace of the Academy walls, it is not to ;
its discredit to be wanting in.
And now, when I have mentioned a dreamy and fanciful head, by
ARMITAGE, called The Lotus Eater; CREswick's Landscapes—in the
old style of subject and effect—and some charming º: by less
known hands, especially two still Welsh river bits of MR. DEARLE's ;
a little glade in a Kentish wood, by a new man, Rose, and an admi-
rable Wiew { Toulon, with a she ving beach and a ragged seaside
track, by a Toulonnais, CourDoNAN, in which the arid ashy-coloured
hills in the distance are given with a terrible truth, and which, with the
wonted courtesy of the Academy hangers, as the work of a foreigner,
has been put down close to the floor, LI have really exhausted all in the
Exhibition that has leſt such an impression on my mind as to render a
catalogue unnecessary. No, I had forgotten a masterly portrait of Dr.
Blakistan, by a painter unknown to me ing the same name—un-
pretending, small, but marvellously finished, rich in colour, appropriate
in details, and unmistakable in characterization. Look for that portrait,
my lord and lady public; it will repay the trouble, though the search
may be a long one—and, when you have gone down on your knees to
it (which you must º tell me what you think of it.
Let me also applaud the cocks and hens of MR. Huggins; they are
almost miniatures of the poultry yard. Neither HoNDIUs nor Hon.DE-
KoeTER ever planted King Chanticleer more royally on his legs nor
É. him a more knowing wag of the wattles over treasure-trove of
arleycorn or grub. And it is something to see even cocks and hens

UGGINs shows in his little pictures. I

“EEN IN THEIR ASHES LIVE THEIR WONTED FIRES.”
Gover Non HUBBARD of the Bank of England has made a noble
stand upon the churchyards of London. He gallantly sets his back
against a tombstone, and defies the sacrilegious rabble who would inter-
fere with the gold-mines (belonging to the Church) in every city church-
yard. Nevertheless, we fear the church-yards are doomed; and, what
is worse, the bishops and archdeacons and deans who have proposed to
themselves the last long solace of º in city churchyard—their
long, sweet sleep soothed by the wheels of omnibus—will haply be
compelled to lie under grass-green velvet quilt gemmed with silver
alsles.
In this dilemma, Punch has a#. sal to make. What if the Bank
cellars were so enlarged as to afford commodious lying for a select few
of the Church; of dignitaries, like the Bishop of London for instance
and ARCHDEACQN HALE, who all their lives have been lovely in their
gold, and in their deaths would not be separated from it P
There would be a fine moral in such a cemetery. Here bars of
gold; and here a dead Bishop ! The Bank cellars are, of course, by
the precious metal they contain, already consecrated.
A Figure Head Saint.
A CELEBRATED image of St. Nicholas—a great miracle-maker—has |:
been placed at the prow of the GRAND DUKE Constantine's ship.
The Saint is warranted to stop every cannon-ball of an enemy; catching
the ball in his teeth, and duly swallowing it; the miracle to be duly
swallowed again by the people of Holy Russia.
GREAT REDUCTION of Stock—Since the abolition of the º
stock, we think we can congratulate England upon possessing, at all
events, one laughing-stock the less.
TEETOTAL TRUTH !
& ALLANTLY faithful to their
tragic threat, half-a-dozen
teetotallers met together last
week at Exeter , to de-
nounce the contemplated ini-
uity of the Crystal Palace
mpany, who propose to
vend wine and malt to the
Sydenham pilgrims. The
meeting was not very nume-
=="rous, but particularly noisy.
Much dirty water was
- º we say, especially
- dirty; inasmuch as, these
temperance apostles think it
all sufficient to morals if
they abstain from alcoholic
- potations. They may misre:
present, they may cant and
slander, if they drink no wine. They may deal in hypocrisy, if they
shun spirits: they may maul the dead, if they avoid the beer-cask. It
matters not how dirty be their speech if their water-bottles contain
only the purelymph. They may wound like wasps, if they only eschew
the bees-wing. - - -
The EARL of HARRINGTON (it is something to catch a live earl in
water; a celebrity only second to the second coming hippopotamus
presided over the minnows; and made a very significant speech; quite
characteristic of the veracity and temperance that ordinarily distinguish
these hydrocephalous Ciceros. He said—the good, veracious Earl!—
he said:—
“The Directors were not allowed to make a gin-shop of the Palace, but yet they had
made it a large beer-shop. (cheers.) In conclusion he stigmatised the act of the Diº
rectors as obtaining mºmey under false pretences, because the people had subscribed
under the belief that the charter would be carried out. (Cheers.)"
Is there not such a i as evil speaking under assumed beneyo-
lence; is there not slandering under false pretences of Christian
charity? We ask it; is there not, O Exeter Hall ! And Exeter Hall
does not echo “ Not /* -
Another Speaker informed the meeting that they had had an inter-
º of Trade, from whom they
view with the President of the Boar -
ſº that the Home Office ºl. astute PALMERSTON | Genuine
ater of crawling humbug, or humbug rampant!) “saw no reason fºr
opposing the introduction of wine and beer, but that they would
exclude spirits!”
Another Qrator much wondered that “the ARchbishop of CANTER-
BURY should consecrate a beer-shop.” Possibly this innocent gentle-
man had never heard, or if so, had wholly forgotten the fact of ONE
who “consecrated” a wedding-feast with wine miraculous!
However, the QUEEN is to be next assaulted § these water-spouts.
Who knows that HER MAJESTY did not herself take a glass of wine to
the success of the Crystal Palace, even as, a few days since, she cracked
a bottle to the good #. of the Royal Albert. We trust, that HER
MAJESTY will be duly protected from the impertinence of these Tem:
perance Apostles. Mr. Punch always desires to respect the liberty of
the subject; nevertheless, it would not throw him, into a very violent
passion if the Temperance deputation, in lieu of being conducted to
the QUEEN, were one and all duly introduced to the Palace pump.
y'all means, let DR. LATHAM make models of these water-men-
these bipeds with fins—for the Ethnological Department. On second
thoughts, we would prefer for the Crystal Palace a live teetotal Earl.
A glass jar might be #. big enough to hold him; a jar to be covered
with a copy of the Crystal Charter—as with parchment you cover a
leech-bottle—that allows the sale of beer and wine. We are not so
inhuman as to wish to cork our Earl; though assuredly there were at
Exeter Hall a few water-bottle men who, for the peace of society,
ought to be laid down for good and all, and never drawn.
A Dreadful Attack.
Accorping, to the last, accounts, Nicholas is very ill. It is a
nervous disorder, we are told. Nothing more likely, and when NAPIER
begins his work in good earnest, we should’nt be in the least surprised
if His Imperial Majesty was ſaid up with a very serious attack of
BAL-Tic Douloureur.
GLIMMERINGS OF Military Intelligence.
TAILORs were always famous for “doing a bit of stiff.”. It is, a
curious coincidence that military stocks and clothing colonels should
have been simultaneously abolished.

ROWA. LYCEUM THE-
- ATRE-MR. CHARLES MA-
E THEWS, in announcing the RE-
OPENING of this THEATRE, can-
not resist the opportunity it affords
him of expressing publicly the at
pride and pleasure experienced by
Mrs. Mathews and himself from the
unexampled loyalty and friendship of
every member of the company, who,
together with the workmen and ser-
wants of the establishment, have shown
faith in the management as unequivocal as it is gratifying, having firmly held
together for a period of five weeks, in spite of the temptations ºffered 9ſ intº:
diate engagements elsewhere, and have patiently waited the chance of his being able
to resume his position. Ma. Mathews, while thus thanking them for their confidence
and goodwill, ventures to hope that this steady adherence of those who have for years
been associated with him, and who, while most intimately acquainted with his Son:
duct and habits, have stood by him through sorrow and loss, will prove, the best
guarantee that the many reports which have found credence from time tº time with
the public have not been founded in truth, and that the unscrupulous disregard of
every principle of honour and probity so frequently and so falsely attributed to him
will appear wholly at variance with the continued cordiality and friendship of all
those who have longest known him.
“Unexampled loyalty l’ Let us begin with loyalty. Well, it is a
gratifying, an ennobling truth that warms the heart like wine, to know
that of aſ the follies, faults, and weaknesses that beset poor fallible
human nature, the actor—in that one conservative virtue, loyalſy—is
an entire and perfect chrysolite. As well, with mere human teeth, try
to bite a fracture in the Koh-i-Noor, as º to flaw the loyalty of your
true actor. Bray him in a mortar, and he would not crack. Assail
him with money-bags, and he will never split. No.: his hand, has
signed his faith to his monarch manager, and you might lay that hand
upon a gridiron and grill it like unto a mutton chop, but that hand
remains faithful to its first ink. There may be no treasury, but the
heart is full; so perish lucre and long live loyalty ---
How beautiful, too, to contemplate the loyal actor proudly smili
(with a little bit of contempt puckering the corners of the plastic .
—smiling we say at the vain and worthless temptations of another
monarch, desirous at º increase of fortune, to corrupt and carry
away, it may be, the loyal Light Comedian—the loyal Heavy Old Man
—the loyal Walking entleman—or even the loyal General Utility.
In vain. The loyal actor laughs—laughs contemptuously—at the bribe
of double º: º paid, and—his stomach may be empty—but,
as we say, his heart is full, and defying the tempter, he proudly strikes
|. ºut. and like a łung down shilling, it rings with precious
Oyalty.
Sweet then is adversity to a manager, for it teaches him the virtues
of those who in their loyalty love and honour him: at human
parcels of unknown spices may be in a playhouse, until the º of
the monarch impresario, shall have pinched and pinched them, and so
brought out their fragrancel, NAPOLEON would never have known all
the fidelity of MontholoN, had NAPOLEON never known St. Helena.
How could Manager STRUTT even guess at the loyalty of a DAGGER-
wood, if STRUTT never known the street of Basinghall!
What an example does the playhouse present to the real brick-and-
mortar-hearted world without! Let all the ORLEANs family take private
boxes, and therefrom contemplate the undying loyalty of Lyceum
actors in comparison with the fleeting fidelity of French politicians,
Could the shifting, twisting, facile TALLEYRAND even for a moment
confront the loyal blaze in the eye of a FRANK MATTHEws?. One
moment, perhaps; and the next, the Frenchman would be a small heap
of very white ashes.
. But there is good reason for this abounding, this everlasting loyalty
in the breasts of Fº towards their manager. A scoffing, careless
world may not know the sort of affecting tenures by which certain
actors hold their places and engage their loyalty. For instance,
the Duke of WELLINGTON holds Strathfieldsaye § tenure of giving in
a yearly flag at Windsor. In like manner, the low Comedian holds his
place by laying, every season, on the dressing-table of his manager, a
new hare's foot. The Old Man pays his fealty in three burnt corks;
and the Walking Gentleman in half-an-ounce of carmine.
A VISION OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
THERE are things more frail than visions, there are falser words than
dreams
Bring, unchallenged, wildly mingling strangest with most common
themes;
But I know not, as each Master laid his gift before the throne,
If I thought the thought of myriads, or my fancy strayed alone.
Marching came a swarth procession, mustering from the banks of -
Nile,
Abject-eyed believers, marshalled by stern priests with eyes of guile.
And with mystic types and symbols were their garments studded o'er,
And the awful veil of Isis was the banner that they bore.
Following trod a prouder army, striding on with martial tread,
From a City, lost for ages, that hath yielded up her dead.
And a grim and giant Monster stalking fiercely in the van,
'Twas a winged Beast—more dreadful that it wore the face of man.
Next a graceful throng went by me, from a classic region fair,
Chiselled features, flowing garments, laurel wreaths in golden hair;
And a God and Goddess led them, glorious types of War and Peace,
NEPTUNE and MINERVA ever watching o'er their well loved Greece.
From their seven-hilled home eternal, then the haughty Swordsmen
Came,
Lictor's fasces, gory axe-head, and the she-wolf's glance of flame,
And four ever famous Letters borne on high in that array,
Told a world that Rome was present—proudly bade the world obey.
Whose luxurious pomp succeeds them, who in smiling throng advance,
Glistening in that flowery raiment, tripping as to feast and dance P
So they glistened, so they revelled, so was struck the sparkling lyre,
On the day Pompeii perished, shrieking in yon mountain's fire.
Some come mourning, come as those whose brightest day hath shone
and fled.
Are they from Byzantium’s rampart, where a hero-king lies dead—
From the noblest fane that glows beneath an oriental sky—
Raised to Christian Wisdom—bearing now the symbol of a Lie.
Came the Church in purple glory and a wealth of gems and gold,
Steel clad knights in soldier-splendour, banners of emblazoned fold,
Armourer, berald, jester, hawker, planet-reader, squire and page,
Chivalry's thrice gorgeous chapter from her proudest Middle Age.
Art’s procession followed, calmly, lofty as their port should be,
Who had dashed down feudal shackles, and proclaimed that Art is free.
Gazing on their deeds of beauty, who but scorns the bigot prate,
That assails their noble mission with a Goth's fantastic hate?
What a glorious train came after, every lofty face a Fame,
All whose Thought our age inherits, or our age itself shall claim.
Those whose names, in self-made light, are burning still on honour's
scrolls,
Those to whom the world is debtor—shall be debtor while it rolls.
But what thunder wave of music comes in grandeur surging out P
Never yet ascended Homage in a nobler, mightier shout,
Fancy's visions instant scatter-sense itself is growing dim.
As all space seems tiding over with that rushing, whelming hymn.
There are things more frail than visions, there are falser words than
dreams
Bring, unchallenged, wildly mingling strangest with most common
themes;
And I know not, as each Master laid his gift before the Throne,
If I thought the thought of myriads, or my fancy strayed alone.

making two hundred pounds which, it seems, may be achieved by any
scoundrel who threatens anybody else with a prosecution for felony.
Such at least would be the inference from a dictum of one of our
ablest judges, MR. B.A.Ron PARKE, who, if he has been truly reported,
observed from the bench, that “he considered there were a great many
persons who would have given a far larger amount [than £200] rather
than have had a prosecution against them.” In another place the
learned judge is reported to have said, “his own opinion was that there
were few persons who would not have given a larger sum rather than
run the risk of having their character ruined.”
If this estimate of the moral courage of society is a correct one, if it
be true that many men, are such abject cowards that they would
rather pay a larger sum than £200, than run the risk of having their
character ruined, it is quite clear that there are many men who, if they
happen to have £300 and a character, are worthy the attention of the
numerous scoundrels, professional and mock professional, as well as
lay, who infest society. .
For our own parts we, with º respect, beg to dissent in toto from
the judicial opinion, as imputed by the reports to MR. BARox PARKE,
and, notwithstanding all the uncertainly of the results of law pro-
ceedings, both criminal and civil, we hope there are very few men
indeed who would pay two hundred farthings, or indeed respond in
any way, except through the police, should they be threatened in the
manner which the learned Judge seems to think would have such a
painful effect on their nerves as to act powerfully on their pockets.
If MR. BARox PARKE has been mis-reported—which we trust he
may have been—he owes it to society to set himself right, for to a
timid man, menaced by some of the pests with which the world
abounds, it will be but poor consolation to remember that a Judge on the
bench is said to have observed, “There are few persons who would not
have given a larger sum [than £200] rather than run the risk of having
their character ruined.”
A SEVERE WISITATION.
Most people are aware that a bishop's triennial progress throughout
|. diocese is called the bishop's visitation: but few know how well it
deserves that name. The readers of the Daily News, however, are
|awake to the fact that it is indeed a regular visitation, as it costs the
unfortunate clergy, on whom it is inflicted, a fee. From the same
journal it may be learned that the visitation fee is demanded, t h
the visitation may not be held. This our contemporary proves by the
uotation of a circular lately addressed to the clergy of the diocese of
ath and Wells, demanding the usual fee of them for the bishop, and
at the same time signifying that their attendance at the “ensuing
visitation”—which was not to ensue—would be dispensed with. Thus
the visitation, although not held, was endured. But this is not all:
for the Bishop of Bath AND WELLs died before his visitation fell due
to his clergy, or their visitation fees to him: notwithstanding which
the visitation fees are still demanded of them: the claimant being the
Archbishop. Thus it may be said that the essential part of the
visitation has been preserved; namely, the Charge: but there is gross
impropriety in this argument, for it involves a joke, and indeed a
practical joke, and a very heavy joke, at the expense of the poor
parsons.

THE LAMENT OF COLONEL MARTINET, K.C.B.
(Late Clothing Colonel of the gallant Onety-Oneth.)
AH me! the tailor’s goose is flown
That laid the Colonel's golden eggs'
The little perquisites are gone
That kept poor Colonels on their legs'
No more shall gallant veterans wield
The scissors nimbly as the sword:
And charge not boldier foes on field,
Than friends upon the clothing-board.
To please vile Punch and viler Times
ERBERT my hard-won hopes has baffled!
SIDNEYs have bled for smaller crimes,
(See Lord John Russell) on the scaffold
What good’s to come of this great boon?
If one may judge by every omen,
The soldier's to be made a spoon,
But one that ne'er will stir our foemen.
They’ve lowered the guardsman's bearskin shako;
pped on his h ere well the war 'gan,
A forage-cap, like that which Jacko
Wears, while congéing on an organ.
They’ve given the soldier leave to wear
(As though his strength lay in his locks)
Unlimited amounts of hair—
And—worse than all—abolished Stocks!
How long will civil funds keep up,
en military stocks are low
Can slovens smartly “shoulder hup!”
Or guns, without stocks, floor the foe?
The neck it squeezed; it swelled the eyes;
True—but “heads up” it kept the clown—
The colonel’s choler needs must rise
To see the private's collar down!
To guard your guards and line from sun,
ith pillow-case you swathe the head—
Soldier fear sun' Son of a gum"
Put the man bodily to bed!
Give him a night-shirt—do—at once—
Expense of uniforms 'twill save;
Let his beard grow like MR. MUNTz,
And only colonels closely shave.
Don't flog him when he misbehaves;
Don't shoot him if on post found napping;
Teach him that time was made for slaves;
Unpipeclayed leave his low black strapping.
When thus the soldier you require
All day long but to stand at ease,
let me to private life retire
And fools be colonels, if they please
THE EX-CLOTHING COLONEL TO HIS SWORD.
My Sword! how bright and lovely thine unsullied blade *g ears,
Now that I wave thee only, and have ceased to wield the Shears!
Ay, now, faith, I can brandish thee with pride, my battle blade.
Since, all resigned to Glory, I’ve no more to do with Trade.
How bounds my gallant charger, and neighs to join the fight
Seeing thee º and sparkle as thqu glancest in the light!
If I a Goose were flourishing, not thus my steed would neigh,
Although I were a Tailor proud as ever pranced away.
Into the rolling Danube my Thimble will I pitch,
And fling my Needle after it, no more to do a stitch;
My only List, the Army List, from this time forth shall be
Nor º I cut out anything, except, my Sword, with thee!
A Washy Composer.
THE musical critic in the Times compares the music of M. ADoIPHE
ADAM to “the rinsings of M. AUBER's bottles.” The illustration is
much to our taste, and the idea may be variously º For
example, it may be said that the singing of an imitation, JENNY LIND
is but the sediment of the Swedish nightingale’s “Jug; ” or that the
musical compositions of one of the mock classical school, are but the
ashes of our friend BAch's 'Bacco pipe. As a climax to this style of
illustration, we would compare the polkas and other airs of an imitation
JULLIEN to the º odours of the Great Maestro's pocket-
handkerchief.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI.
LORD PALMERSTON ON PENMANSHIP.
ord PALMERston, “touched
to fine issues” in allthings,
has just put forth certain
canons of penmanship.
He complains that—
“The great bulk of the middle
and lower orders write hands
too small and indistinct and do
not form their letters; or they
sometimes form them by alter-
nate broad and fine strokes,
which make the words difficult
to read.”
His Lordship finally
suggests that pupilsshould
be taught rather to imitate
broad printing than fine
copper-plate engraving.
In fact, rather to write
broadsides than bank-
notes.
Lord PALMERStoN,
however, gives private
lessons on style: and Mr.
Punch has been favoured—(he will not say by whom)-with specimens from the
hand of the EARL of ABERDEEN, before and after tuition, by the accomplished
Home SECRETARY. We select two:—
My Style before I took a Lesson. - -
“I think the CzAR or All the Russias is a perfect gentleman. I believe in
Nicholas as the great legitimate beadle of Europe; a man who combines the
biggest cocked hat with the noblest sense of order. A man of truth; indeed, a
perfect gentleman is Nicholas.
My Style after one Lesson. -
“I believe the CzAR to be a compound of hypocrite and bully: a swaggering
mass of raw despotism. As was said of Sylla, he is a mass o mud and blood.
Very necessary is it for the future repose of the world that we make sharp and
short work with the world's peacebreaker. “ABERDEEN.”
And this, it will be seen, after only one lesson. What a pity PALMERSTON
---
“ABERDEEN.”
CHAMBER PRACTICE.
MADAME Tussaud has “a Chamber of Horrors,” into
which none are admitted but the greatest delinquents,
on whose countenances there is set—in wax—the seal of
iniquity. We doubt, however, whether MADAME TUSSAUD's
Chamber of Horrors can show anything much more horrible
than may be found in the Judges' Chambers near Chancery
Lane, when frequented by some of those sham attorneys and
their pretended clerks, to whose doings the laxity of Chamber
Practice too often fixes the seal of judicial authority.
Not long ago a suspected criminal, who had been refused
bail at a Police Court, escaped the hands of justice through
the mode of doing business at the j udges' Chambers,
where a little perjury, a little personation, and the appear-
ance of one or two sham attorneys or their pretende
clerks, served to satisfy the “Judge at Chambers,” who
ordered the release of an alleged culprit, who has of course
kept out of the way of trial.
omplaints have often been made of the want of dignity
and decorum in the doings at the Judges' Chambers, where
crowds of harpies, are permitted to congregate, but we
can scarcely wonder at the scandal having reached its
present height, when the title of an attorney may be assumed
without a challenge, and in some cases even costs may
be awarded to thc harpies, and “no questions asked” by
the Judge or his underlings. “How are we to know,”
cries the judicial authority or his deputy, when a scamp
is found to have defeated justice, and put honest persons
to trouble and expense through the negligence practised
at the Judges' Chambers. How are we to know indeed?
—if we don’t give ourselves the least trouble to inquire.
The Force of Contrast.
WE have a shrewd suspicion that the poor meek-minded
creatures who go in for “peace at any price,” are afflicted
with dreadfully unruly wives. We suspect that it is their
having so much War at home that makes them anxious
to see Peace at all events abroad.

MR. PUNCH AT THE FRENCH PLAY.
(Written for last week's insertion, at midnight.)
I AM fresh from that consummate piece of truth in action, La
Joie futt Peur. Oh that our English actors could find such pieces !
Oh that such pieces, if we had them, could find such actors!, I have
sat to-night and wept, amongst a weeping house, and it was all for the
affection of a mother for her son, of a son for his mother, of a sister
for her brother, of an old servant for the family he had grown grey in.
The love passage of the story—as we narrow the word—is nothing.
Nobody cares, a fig for Mathilde and Octave. Better acting of both
parts might do something even for them perhaps; but, as it is, and
under any circumstances, the real moving interest, of the act is con-
centrated entirely upon the domestic affections, in which there is
intensity, but not what we call passion.
It seems, on our stage, as if we knew of no love but that of lovers.
We ride that one wretched passion to death on the slightest pro-
vocation. The rich treasure of tenderness that lies under our hearth-
stones is all but unworked. See, how much it yields in this one short
act of deep pathos, varying emotion, breathless interest. And with all
the call upon our cambric there is not a mawkish word or a single
clap-trap from beginning to end. Perhaps none but a woman could
have written the piece. That mother's hand, which comes in at
the door to receive the breviary from the son so long mourned as
dead, who, not daring to reveal himself, presses on the book the
kiss he yearns to fasten on the wasted fingers, could only have
been conceived by a woman. And what man could have imagined
that sweet little Blanche in her sudden burst from constrained
sorrow to natural joy, so beautifully impersonated by MADEMOISELLE
LUTHER P - -
I write warmly, because I feel warmly. In such pieces the stage is
put to its best use, as a quickener and stirrer of the affections, without
any aid from criminal intrigues, exceptional passions, startling alter:
nations, or terrible incidents. But how infinitely more powerful
than all these is that unyielding hold on the heart strings from first to
last! And then the acting! Whom ought I, to praise first, or
loudest? REGNIER, with his bald head, bowed shoulders, and straggling
old legs, loving, conceited, hasty, fond. How true in every movement
- - —7
and intonation . How perſect in the filling up of his by-play, every
bit of it belonging to the man and the scene, occupying him through-
out, yet apparently unconscious, and only felt in its result of perfect
and unforced truth.
Here was no drawing up for points, no driving of sentiments down
the audience's throats with the s edgehammers of accentuation, no exit
speeches—all was graduated, mellow as an old picture, or as nature
herself. The old man moved before us modest, gentlemanlike, yet
every inch a servant; something you could not help at once loving and
respecting, whether you laughed at him or cried with him. THow
terrible he was in that burst of emotion, when the lost one comes
back, and he lunges forward, with the boast of self-possession stayed
on his lips, into Adrien's arms, a helpless old bag of clothes! How
K. in that anile storm of sudden sobbing, wrung from him by
MADEMOISELLE LUTHER’s pretty tender coaxing! How humourous
in his conceit of his own force and foresight! how irresistible in his
insuppressible outbursts of joy, while Adrien's safety is yet his sole
Secret
Nor should MADAME ALLAN stand a step lowcr than REGNIER, for
her perfect rendering of a still more difficult part, through two-thirds
of which she has but to exhibit various shades of hopeless grief, and
for the rest, the struggle of despair with a hope that is almost
more terrible than despair. And fººt shall I say of dear,
innocent, golden-haired, joyous little LUTHER P They tell terrible
stories of the French stage; but I will stake my life that is a ;
irl. Why have we ºis in the remotest degree approaching
ADEMoiselLE LUTHER upon our stage P Why is that combination
of innocence, archness, wilfulness, and lovingness, utterly, unknown to
our répertoire? Why is woman's joyousness with us almost always
marred by coarseness? Why are our hoydens always Miss PRUEs,
more or less P Why is the combination of actors in this piece a thing to
drive English stage-writers wild with despairing envy of their French
brethren? Must this always be so? Are we for ever destined to see
our few real artists, our Charles MATHEwses, our WIGANs, our
WEBSTERs, our KEELEYs, scattered few and far between like comets,
instead of clustering—as ALLAN, REGNIER, LUTHER, cluster in this
little act—into a constellation? Shall we never have an ensemble
on a British stage It behoves our authors and our actors to stir
themselves for a reply.

~ Y DEAR SIR
“Though your
periodical is jocular in
its nature and title, and
occasionally trifling in its
details, I am told that a
good deal of truth lurks
in its satire; indeed that
much more of the com-
modity is to be found in
your columns than in the
broadsides of your gigantic
contemporaries, who ro-
fess to supply only authen-
tic information.
I am not myself a
man of the least humour:
I do not make jokes nor
value them, nor under-
stand them for the most
part: so yours may be
very good, though I for
my ſº cannot compre-
hend what sets your read-
ers a-laughing. The same
is the case with tunes.
The other day at the re-
view at Scutari I mistook

of . brother poets I
am told
(I am considered
one of the first in the wº labour under a similar obtuseness of ear.

of my communications from the seat of War; 1st, Because the Press though often misled

do in the Journal des Débats or the Allgemeine Zeitung: 2nd, because I know you exercise
a great influence in Europe; and have seen personally the three Emperors, my friend the
King of NAPLEs, and His Holiness THE Pope, and CARDINAL ANTONELLI frantic at your
satire: 3rd, because, strange to say, you appear to have engaged no correspondent: and
4th, because I am the best correspondent in the world. - - -

thought of putting pen to paper myself. I met this young man at Malta, and Gallipoli
afterwards; gave him every information in my power, and supplied him with many of the
facts, which I need not say he ludicrously distorted and exaggerated in his journal. He was
put out of an English ship of war §§ says, at his own desire) on board of a Greek schooner,
the Hagid Alethea, off ëi. and would have been murdered by the crew and the master (a
F. and a very old friend of mine), for the sake of his portmanteaus, which appeared to
e pretty well plenished, had I not happened to be drinking in the cabin with my friend the
piratical skipper. At my entreaties *{ threats (for I had to produce my revolvers), the
young man was saved; and I landed him at Gallipoli stairs, with his bag, and baggage
without receiving from him even the present of a single cigar. Yor, as I see by his printe
letters, has he made the least subsequent mention of his preserver; it will be well for him
for the future not to come into the neighbourhood of the 14th Bashi-Bozouks, or their Colonel.

you to the world; and thus my indignation at the ingratitude of a newspaper writer, is possibly
the cause of enlightening and instructing all Europe. -
“Hitherto, all Europe has been wofully misled. Any one, for instance, who will take the
trouble to tot up the number of dead Russians who are slaughtered in every newspaper
bulletin that we get from the seat of war in the East, will find that they drop off at the rate of
two or three thousand a day, and that a quarter of a million of them by this time must, have
one to visit Hades. My good friend, Mr. Punch, these murderous histories are all bosh!
Jewspaper correspondents, I fully agree with my noble friends LoRD, SMOTHEREM, and
LoRD Both EREM, in the House of Peers, are not to be relied upon, and Qught to be put down.
As for the Turks, they are notorious long-bow pullers. My poor friends the Russians, with
and against whom I have served a good deal in the Caucasus, are greater liars than the
unbelievers. What the nation wants is TRUTH. Truth pure, Truth unadulterated, Truth
gushing from the original tap, such as perhaps no other man in Europe but myself is in a
condition to supply. - -
“I choose to sign myself WERAx, though that of course is not my family name, which
is the noblest in the three kingdoms; but have such a regard for truth in all things, that
even of this little deviation from it I think fit to warn the reader. ...I never told a lie in my

familiarity so far as to insist on my calling the

refused to do; but the young princes and prin-

constables together in Eaton Place, on the 10th of April, '48. As for

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ST. BARNABAS FUND DINNER.
MR. PUNCH has rather an objection, like that of MRs. ADAMs, to
quoting Scripture. Nevertheless Mr. Punch will take the liberty of
citing the following words:
“Blessed are they which are persecuted for religion's sake: for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven.”
They form, according to the Morning Post, an inscription, placed
above a portrait which was suspended the other day in the school-room
...”to the Church and College of St. Barnabas, Pimlico. That
work of art represented the REv. MR. BENNETT, the late vicar; and it
was exhibited at the anniversary festival of the dedication of the
church. Other embellishments harmonizing in an aesthetical point of
view with MR. BENNETT's likeness, appear to have adorned what may
not ºperly be termed the scene. Our fashionable contemporary
says that—
“The rooms were tastefully decorated with representations of the cross, wreaths of
laurel, and other evergreens, vases of flowers, banners, and coloured scrolls, containing
texts from Scripture and appropriate inscriptions.”
Bare walls would have been suitable to a plain text, and if the latter
was cooked it was right that the former should be dressed. Certainly the
portrait was in good keeping with its accessories, and so were they
with it, and with each other. Hung about, too, with so much laurel
and other evergreens, the place must have been quite a green-room : =
and this was as it should be, if you consider the nature of the esta-
blishment.
There is said to exist an apocryphal epistle of St. BARNABAs; per- =
haps the beatitude of those who are persecuted “for religion's sake,”
is declared in that. But if so, the St. BARNABAs who composed the
Epistle was probably St. BARNABAs, Pimlico.
The Post goes on to state, that the health of the Hon. AND REv.
MR. LIDDELL, having being proposed by ColoneL FULRE GREville,
M.P., M.R. Liddell, made a speech to returnthanks: in which he said,
“We are charged with doing a most dreadful thing. What do you think—we are
all charged with Popery! º: Why, if there is one thing more than another
which can stem the encroachments of Popery, it is the establishment of such churches
as this—of St. Barnabas—where the spirit of the Church of England is brought out.”
Brought out?—yes, so completely out as to leave none in; is that
the Reverend Gentleman's meaning?—No doubt, if one, thing more
than another can stem the º of Cognac, it is the manufac.
ture of British brandy so much like it, that the common palate can
hardly distinguish between the two. A taste for brandy is fostered,
however, and people ultimately come to want the foreign article.
Experience appears to have shown that the case of brandy is pretty
much the same with that of MR. LIDDELL’s “spirit” of the .
of England.
The Bulwark gives a wood-cut, representing the interior of
“St. Paul's, Knightsbridge, from a sketch, taken May 1, 1854.” In
this engraving a Clergyman is represented as making a bow and a
genuflexion to the altar, which has a couple of lighted candlesticks
upon it, and a cross between them peeping over the rim of a plate.
wo other Clergymen are kneeling at the altar-side; each of these
has another standing behind him; in the front, R., so to speak, there
are two more ecclesiastics, with paten and chalice” whilst a man in a
black gown with a long pole stands L. Now. St. Paul's is under the
same management as St. Barnabas's, and one is as much like the other
as Drury Lane is like Covent Garden. -
Whilst, however, the tapers of the Barnabites are alluded to, their
candle, in another sense, should not be kept out of sight... Mr. Punch
has great pleasure in further transcribing the statement that, at this
festival of theirs,
*Tables were spread for upwards of 200 of the poorer members of the Congregation.”
This indicates a means of proselytism and a method of contro-
versy that might be adopted by all denominations, one against the
other, to the great edification of the world at large, and the con-
siderable diminution of the #. rates. It is suggested, therefore,
that moderate Churchmen, Evangelicals, and Dissenters of every
class, should set to at spreading tables for the conversion of the
poorer members of society, and that the regular Papists should contend
with the º in the same manner; of them thus endeavouring
to turn the tables upon each other.
Larcenists and Felonists.
In the debate on the prison estimates, LoRD PALMERston is
reported to have stated that
“Upon the admission of convicts, they declare the religion to which they belong.”
About the religion of a convict we should think there must generally
be . doubt, although it would be impossible to question his
conviction.

TOASTS AND SENTIMENTS FOR RUSSIA-TAXED
BEER.
UNCH thinks that as Beer has risen in
rice in consequence of the war with
ussia, it may be as well to provide a
few Toasts and Sentiments, by means
of which the popular indignation ma
have an opportunity of venting itself.
Accordingly, we beg to present every
patriotic beer-drinker with his choice
of the following Toasts to flavour his
beer with :
Here’s to the emptiest of all sacks,
the Cossack—and as no empty sack
can stand, may we soon witness the
fall of the Cossack.
The Russian EAGLE 1–May we
shortly see it “All alive oh!” at the
Zoological Gardens!
Here’s to the Sublime Porte; and
also to its English and French butlers
that prevented Nicholas making a
MAGNUM BONUM of it.
Russian TALLow—The first candle
that was held to the Devil must have
been made out of it.
The Worst IMPERIAL MEASURE.-
The halfpenny extra on every pot.
However, may it be the means of
very quickly sending old Nicholas
there!
Here’s to the Russian nobility, and may the crazy old vessel soon
be dashed to pieces on its own Serf:
The Best Draught to cool, THE EMPERoR’s WARLIKE FEVER.
—A NAPIERient Draught. - -
Here’s to that fine old game-cock Turkey, and may it never be in
want of a Drumstick as long as England and France have it in their
power to give it one ! - -
Here’s to Russia, the bullying giant, with a body of brass, and feet
of clay. May the former be knocked up into English and French
door-knockers, and the latter be made into bricks to build the
EMPERoR a tomb that he may be handsomely buried in, and we will
not mind throwing in the Bier.
PENANCE IN BELGRAVIA.
MR. WesTERTON has been returned Churchwarden for St. Paul's
Knightsbridge, to the confusion and agony of several distinguishe
countesses and other ladies of the fashionable church; all of whom
intend to mark their sorrow by some sort of penance and mourning.
The Countess of SMALLBEERsBURY has taken a vow to go without
eggs until next Paschal; and on Saturday last all the spaniels of
Belgravia appeared in leading strings of black riband.

The Two Extremes of Fashion.
FoEMERLY, when ladies went out, they used to have their bonnets
on; but that is no longer the case, for their bonnets are now not on,
but half off. The reason generally assigned by our female acquaintance
why bonnets are thus worn, is, because they are. There is, however,
a somewhat more logical one to be given than this; namely the length
of the dress. Condemned by theº of Fashion to screen their feet
and angles from admiration, the ladies # themselves by showing
as much as possible of the head. -

A FLUNKEY GOVERNMENT IN SPAIN.
IN #. our Ministers wear what is called the Windsor Uniform,
which although a quiet compromise between the dress of a penny post-
man and that of a parish beadle, is nevertheless more dashing than
dignified. In Spain, however, the Queen has degraded the Cabinet
into an establishment of Flunkeys by a process which will be explained
by the following paragraph :-
*The Madrid Gazette of the 20th ult. contains the following royal decree:—"Ex-
cellency: Considering the necessity for the Ministers of the Crown in active service,
to carry always a distinctive sign of the superior authority they exercise, and the tall
walking cane being, according to the laws and cus'oms of Spain, the emblem of all
authority. Her Majesty, the Queen (whom may God preserve!) has. after hearing her
Council of Ministers, deigned to order that the {{...}. of the Crown in active service
shall always carry, when in uniform or plain clothes, a tall cane with the head and
tassel in gold. By order of the Queen, I communicate this to your Excellency for your
uidance. May God keep you many years! Count DE SAN Luis. Madrid, 34th May.
o the Minister of ... "
It seems, then, that the “tall Wºlf cane,” which in England is
the emblem of all beadledom, and of all the loftier regions of footman:
ship, is, “according to the laws and customs of Spain, the emblem of
ALL AUTHORITY.” A Spanish minister of the Crown is therefore
ordered, when on active service, either in uniform or in plain clothes—
both in and out of livery—to walk about with an instrument similar to
that which has long swayed the destinies of our arcades, and been the
terror of London boyhood in the hands of the despot of Lowther or
the autocrat of Burlington.
We may easily imagine the spirit of a ministry which is ready to
assume the badge of footmanship at the bidding of the Queen, and we
can have no doubt that the whole of the Spanish government would
rush into plush, or put powder or any other trash into their heads, and
even carry a nº continually, in the hand, at the bidding of their
royal mistress. e find some difficulty in imagining the full extent of
the absurdity of this decree, for we cannot fancy LoRn John strutting
about with “a tall cane with the head and tassel in gold,” as the
emblem of his office. Our gold and silver sticks are ridiculous enough,
as the wretched props of a worn-out system of a degrading school of
ceremony which is nearly extinct, but a whole ministry walking about
with long footman's canes, presents a picture of melancholy tomfoolery
which in almost any other country but Spain would tumble over by
the extent of its own inanity.
NOT EASILY SEEN THROUGH.
SoMEBony is advertising glasses of such power, that they
would render objects visible at a distance of two miles.
Considering that there are some objects which it is an
object with many of us to avoid, we cannot regard as
an unmixed good an instrument which enables us to see
at a distance of two miles that which we would gladly
overlook if it were near to us. As a medium for cut-
ting.an unpleasant acquaintance, or warning a debtor of a
creditor's approach, a glass which can pick an individual
out at a . of two miles can hardly fail to be ac-
ceptable. - - - - -
Our own experience of a glass of this kind is not very
satisfactory, for after trying one the other day, we came
to the conclusion, that though we might possibly discern
with it an article two miles off, to see clearly by its
aid an object at two hundred yards' distance was quite
impossible.

CATALOGUE
or
A CURIOUS COLLECTION IN THE STONE PALACE
AT WESTMINSTER.
MEssIEURs PUFF’EM AND QUIz’EM present their respects
To the Curious Public, and beg to annex
An account of the specimens, brought from all parts
Of the kingdom, of objects in science and arts,
At the Palace at Westminster, open to view,
By ticket, each night in the week, except two.
They flatter themselves that the Public will find
No Collection elsewhere of a similar kind. -
P. and Q. must confess—and take leave to premise,
That the building is not yet of very great size.
A HALL and two CHAMBERs are all that are ready,
With A’Court, and a PortAL, not massive, but steady :
Not so with two WANEs, for, why they can’t say,+
Each obstinate WANE points a different way.
But now for the list:—P. and Q. have long kept on
The science of Landscape a sharp eye, like REPTON.
They acknowledge they cannot yet §: the Chinese,
And, perhaps, they are somewhat deficient in trees...
ś OAKEs they have got, and a Wood, rather thin ;
But they hope very soon to º many more in.
Though no “braes,” they have BANKEs, and a BRooke, though
no fountain; -
A HILL they’ve secured; they’ve no place for a mountain,
Nor room for a sea; if they had, they've a BEACH ;
Then they’ve WELLs, and pure wº within easy reach.
In higher Zoology and in the low,
P. and § have some very rare species to show.
To begin with the last;-the flesh-feeders, though many,
Do not eat each other, like cats of Kilkenny.
A few are ferocious, but most are quite tame
And will stand on two legs, when called by their name.
There’s a Buçk, never dangerous, though he's punk,
And a Hogg, but his tusk (if he had one) is shed.
For the chase, there’s a Roebuck, with two kinds of Fox.
Of birds, they’ve a Coote, and a MARTIN, and CoCKs.
Of fish, the collection at present is thin:
There's a RochE; of another there is but a PHINN.
Qf the great mammal, man, they've some whimsical samples;
They mention a few, just § way of examples.
There's Foley at full length—no JAQUEs could doubt him,
Yet with none of the motley or zany about him.
Qne is SwiFT, though his motions be ever so slow;
Another ranks high, though he's known to be Lowe.
One, constantly MooDY, is cheerful and hearty;
Ånd one a good HAYTER, the man for a party.
Although most have their tempers well under command,
Yet the HASTIE are double the number of BLAND ;
And, strangest of all, there are two-and they’ve wives,
Will continue quite Young and a Čhip all their lives.
That “the best are the fewest’” old sages advise;
So there’s only one GooDMAN, and only one Wise:
And a Wyse has º in, -but not one that will hurt you;
Yet it grieves P. and Q. that they have not a virtue.
Of mineral science they’ve little to say:
There’s fine Limerick Goold under true London CLAY.
In the artisan line, the collection’s abundant;
In SMITHs of all kinds it may perhaps be redundant.
There’s a GARDNER, a FULLER, a TYLER, a TAYLOR,
º last two could serve as Soldier and Sailor),
CARTER, a PottER, a BUTLER tip-top,
And two SADLEIRs, Lone lately gave up a good shop.
A HoRsMAN there is, but he don't teach the horse.
As they’ve CoLEs, why a CoLLIER they must have, of course.
The fabrics of art which the Public may see,
Include MANGLEs and MILLs, a Locke (but no key),
A. CofFIN, one PATTEN, two BALLs and a BELL,
With a BAGGE that protects all farm-produce quite well.
Of colours, the list into duplicates runs:—
They've two BRowNs and two GREENES, two GREYs and two DUNNEs,
Which sometimes change hues, though they don't fade away:
A GREY in the night may be º the next day.
Should refreshments be needed, they can, in a trice.
Serve up, ready dressed, a good CURRIE and Rice.
Malt liquor is scarce:—it’s a fact there’s no blinking,
Though they’ve (H)ALE, pretty old, it is not fit for drinking.
But they’ve always in store, if you wish to be merry,
Two Bötts (neither empty), and excellent PERRy,
With LEMON and PEEL, to give it a zest,
And FELLowes who would not look grave at a jest.
No music by law is allowed in the place,
But a chorus, for that they’ve a very deep BASs.
S.P.. No gratuities paid at the door:
And observe that it opens precisely at four.
SPIRITS WANTED FOR THE NAVY.
. EveRYBODY admits that much of the naval success of England
in former days has been due to, our naval songs, which used to ignite
the º of our tars with the sacred flame of poetry.... We have
therefore to recommend to the Admiralty that, in addition to the
advertisements now being issued for a supply of Baltic Pipe Staves,
some announcements should be §. forth for a º of Patriotic
Staves, which may be piped at the Baltic with the best effect on the
spirits of our seamen. #. juice in bottles is an excellent thing,
no doubt, for the bodily health of the fleet, but a quantity of poetic
measures—brimming over with the flow of soul—would, we are sure,
be found conducive to bringing our hearts of oak into healthy action.
As Government, departments can seldom do anything without a
precedent, or, in other words, are so destitute of bold originality, that
they always want something to copy, we have much pleasure in
furnishing the following specimen of an advertisement:-
ONTRACT FOR THE SUPPLY OF PATRIOTIC SPIRITS FOR
THE NAVY. — The Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High
Admiral, do hereby give notice, that they are now ready to treat with such Poets and
Song-Writers as may be willing to contract for supplying and delivering into HER
MAJesty's Printing-Office, 500 Lines of Patriotic Staves fit for immediate use in the
Black Sea and the Baltic. Samples of the sort of article required may be seen in any
edition of the songs of DiBDIN. Every stave must be at least sixteen feet long, of
approved poetic measure. Every stave must contain a fair amount of genuine spirit,
which must be capable of extension, by amalgamation with the air, to which every
stave must be expressly adapted.
Tenders need not be sealed; but they must show marks of something
beyond the ordinary stamp. There should be no useless words, and if
any figures are introduced, they must be of an intelligible character.
Tar and Tartar.
ADMIRAL PLUMRIDGE has destroyed 18,000 casks of Russian tar at

PLEBEIAN AND PATRICLAN PUFFING.
MR. PUNCH has recently been invited to direct his attention to the
#. advances which have been made in the Literature of mercantile
u
nº.
He i.e. not allude to the devices of aristocratic tradesmen at the
West End, who insert paragraphs in the Post and Herald, in the form
of editorial observations, beginning with reflections on the destinies of
Europe, and concluding with the consoling, assurance that, though
thrones may totter, and dynasties fade away, the emporium of MEssRs.
TAG, RAG, AND SHoddy still displays its unrivalled assortment of, &c.
Nor does he refer to the swindling circulars which scamps, who
allege that they have an enormous and splendid stock to dispose of at a
great sacrifice, contrive to deliver at our houses, at hours when the heads
of the families are sure to be absent, and the ladies (who were never
intended by nature to resist “bargains”) are likely to be deluded into
* of rubbish, and to be bullied or cheated, and probably
oth.
Nor does he advert to the fabrications of music publishers, who puff
their songs with extracts from fabulous journals; nor to the “ º:
of the provincial press” cited by booksellers in favour of intolerable
novels; nor to the miraculous cures effected by the newly discovered
Aromatic Oil of Tadpoles upon the persons of afflicted aristocrats; nor
to the hundred and one quackeries of the kind which address themselves
to the wealthier members of the genus asinus.
Mr. Punch has been requested to look at humbler, expedients, to
obtain notice, and to remark now the example of the patrician puffer has
wrought with his plebeian brother. A great mass of compositions of
this kind has been handed in to Mr. Punch, and he has pleasure in
submitting afew specimens, which, if they have not the insinuating tone
of JENKINs (whose leisure hours, when Kºi... can spare him,
are devoted to the service of the tradesmen of Marchionesses) have
a rough, careless dash and flavour of their own.
The first is poetical, and is embellished by a large and highly coloured
engraving of two ladies, who follow the invaluable profession of a cook.
But there are cooks and cooks. One of these indies is magnificently
attired in a brilliant yellow gown, red bonnet, and green shawl, an
carries a gorgeous reticule and a yariegated parasol. The other is in
humbler garb–and is indeed shabby...The former is attended by a
joyous little boy, who, with his lady friend, form the “merry throng”
alluded to in the verses.
A CONVERSATIon.
Shabby Lady. Where are you going, you merry throng?
Fine Lady. To the Marine Store S º so come along.
S. L. But what to do if I may make bold?
F. L. To turn Rubbish into Silver and Gold.
S. L. Indeed, I should like to go as well;
But really I have nothing to sell.
F. L. Nonsense. I thought like you, ELIZA,
But now I’ve grown a good deal wiser.
Last Sunday I looked dreadful shabby,
My gownd was torn, and my bonnet was flabby,
And as for my shoes, the sight was piteous,
They were a deal more holy than righteous.
S. L. And how did you get such a fine turn-out,
Wºº fit to go to Victorſ.A's rout!
F.I. By taking all sorts of odds and ends,
To a man who deals with myself and friends.
Nothing comes wrong, spoons, candles, or keys,
Coals, penknives, scissors, just what you please.
Soap, brushes, handkerchiefs, please to bring,
Qr once in a way, a brooch or a ring.
The hundred things that Missuses miss,
But nobody never knows where they is.
Bring any or all to JonATHAN SLUM
He asks no questions, and pays like fun.
S. L. You're right, Ma'am, right as ever can be,
You're attir'd in splendour, and why not me?
To-night with a bundle of things I’ll come,
And so hurrah for JonATHAN SLUM
The above and similar invitations may perhaps account for a few
phenomena of disappearances which occasionally puzzle our matrons.
Mr. Punch proceeds to the next specimen, which is from the same
school, but addressed to the weaknesses of the stronger sex. It is illus-
trated with a picture in two compartments. In one of them a very
showily dressed young lady is looking greatly disgusted at the advances
; a ragged, dirty suitor, and in the character of DINAH, addresses
lin.
WILLIKINS AND HIS IDINAH.
“Now really, MR. WILLIKINs, I can’t †. Yermission,
For you to come courting in that horridcon tion,

And not at all fit to talk to a lady. -

And get yourself dressed like a regular Beau
This uncompromising advice is, we are to understand, followed by
MR. WILLIRINs, for in the companion engraving he is represented in
magnificent costume, very loud trowsers, a gorgeous waistcoat, and a
bright blue coat, and he has a swagger, strongly contrasting with his
previous hang-dog appearance. He addresses the lady:
“I took your advice, my dearest DINAH,
And I think you’ll own. I’m a good deal finer.
What a splendid assortment does Slopwork keep,
What spicy clothes, and how precious cheap !
The charmed lady responds:
“Oh, really, dear WILLIRINs, how truly kind,
To keep my humble advice in mind,
ndeed you look remarkable smart,
And have quite enchanted your DINAH's heart;
Therefore let all young bachelors go

Here Mr. Punch will pause for the present, but he has still, a large
collection, proving to JENKINs and his aristocratic friends that one
touch of puffing makes the whole set kin.
A Safe Speculation.
SINCE that stupendous work, the Crystal Palace at Sydenham has
been executed by a private company, the idea maturally presents itself
that the same agency that has reared such a º of peace might be
employed for the purpose of effecting, as speedily and as thoroughly,
a triumph of war. An association might be got up which should con-
tract with Government, for a certain sum, to put down the EMPERQR
of Russia; and if this project were adopted there can be little doubt
that the thing would be done; the Russians driven back; peace firmly
established; and Nicholas abolished, in a very much shorter time than
any one of these objects is likely to be accomplished by the present, or
any other, Cabinet.
Ill-Treatment of Mr. Ursquirt.
At a recent meeting called by MR. David, URsquºt, the ungrate-
ful folks gave three cheers for Turkey, and shut their ears to the
Goose!. The excuse for this omission is, that there was never so big a
goose with so little of the Sage in him!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE SCHELMSMUSEUM.
HE project now on foot for
G ===6 the formation of a Trade
Museum has found favour
with Mr. Punch, who is
anxious to commend it
heartily to the notice of the
“nation of shopkeepers.”
To such a nation a Trade
Museum would at any time
be i...ºf amusing, and
instructive, but as the pre-
valence of fraud and impo-
sition in every branch of
trade, shows that we are fast
returning to those good old
times when the occupation
of a trader was very properly
termed his “mystery” or
his “craft.” Punch hastens
to put forth, the Prospectus
of another Museum or Exposition (as the French would call it) of all
the “Mysteries of London.” A suitable building will be erected at no
expense whatever, on the plan which has answered so well in many of
our newly built, suburbs. The purchase money of the site will be
borrowed, and when the title deeds have been obtained the site will be
mortgaged. . With the money thus procured the building materials
will be purchased, and when the building is complete it also will be
mortgaged., The newly acquired funds may be º to the purpose
of paying the builder, but as at the same time they may not. Punch
leaves the public to conjecture what is most likely to become of them:
The Schelmsmuseum (to borrow a word from those dear Germans) will
illustrate all, the frauds and adulterations of ancient and modern
tradesmen, display the rapid strides which our generation has made,
and serve at once as a stimulus to the ingenuity of our children, and as
a starting point from which their progress may hereafter be measured.
Thus, on entering the vestibule of the building, the spectators will
look with interest on the statue of the founder of the art; the first man
who “sanded the sugar,” or, as the inscription on the statue says,
Qui miscuit utile dulci... And they will naturally be led to reflect upon
the wonderful genius of his disciples, who have so far improved upon
the practice of their master as to adulterate, the sand also. The
enthusiast in the cause on jºi in the vestibule a beautiful series
of preparations, such as coffee adulterated with chicory, wherein was
mingled bread-crust, in the composition of which alum, partly made up
of bone dust, had been used, *triumphantly infer that adulteration
is carried on ad infinitum, and is therefore honest, as the purchaser of
an article composed of an infinite series of articles must get all that he
intends to buy. The directors of the Schelmsmuseum will take great
pains to º the raw material in immediate connexion with the
manufactured article, though, for obvious reasons, the process of
manufacture must be left to the imagination of the beholders. Thus
one case will contain fine specimens of the felis communis of LINNAEUs,
and the canis domesticus of BUFFON, together with a mutton pie and a
pound of pork sausages.
A jar of new Hybla honey will appropriately accompany a hive of
bees, but it will be left to the last named industrious creatures to say
§ they can be induced to unbuzzum) why they put so much sugar at
purpence per pound, into their honey, and whether the alteration of
the sugar duties will make any difference to them. Also if any one
happens to, understand the language of orange-flowers, he may learn
from them how it is that carrots ...; turnips grow on the orange trees
which the makers of marmalade cultivate.
Unable to specify the numberless attractive objects by which the
triumphant progress of fraud and adulteration will be illustrated
Punch passes on to other arrangements. The directors had intende
to engage several brass bands, but on reflecting, that to be in harmony
with the rest of the exhibition, the musicians must only utter false
notes, they thought it better to dispense with music altogether than to
run a risk of wearying the public by too rigid an adherence to first
principles. -
Several interpreters will be required to explain to the visitors the
Greek and Latin names of the articles exhibited. And as the CHAN.
CELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER has abandoned his scheme for the im-
rovement of the Civil Service, it is to be hoped that the authorities at
ing's College will devote to the training of such interpreters the depart-
ment which they had intended for candidates for admission into
Government Offices. Furthermore, following the line of some other
speculators, who seek to gain public favour by occasionally patronising
a public charity, the Directors intend to devote the profits of one day
in every week—to wit, Sunday, when the Exhibition will be closed—to
the use of the unfortunate. And Punch is authorised to state that
the first beneficiares will be two millers, one of whom has so injured
his health by inhaling the alum which he grinds up with the flour, that
he has been compelled to relinquish his business; while the other has,
in like manner, so impregnated his system with bone-dust, as to have
brought on, ossification of the heart—a circumstance which induces
Punch to alter an old adage thus—“What is bone in the bread will
not out of the flesh.”
NEW CHAIRS AT OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE.
ONE clause is wanting to the University Reform Bill, which the
Government, should immediately supply. #. should be made
for the creation of a new Professorship at Oxford and Cambridge. The
very numerous cases of young clergymen, and other inexperienced
youths who are continually coming before the public, in the Law
Reports as victims of bill stealers in connextion with bill discounters,
generally Semitic, have established a necessity for this. That branch
of learning wherein a Professorship is needed, is the knowledge of the
world; knowingness; or, in the vernacular, gumption. At present
greater ignorance prevails at the Universities on this subject than on
natural history and philosophy, or even the laws of health, and the
structure and functions of the human frame. Prodigal after prodigal,
arson after parson, figures in the Insolvent, Bankruptcy, or Nisi
rius Court; one as like the other as two peas of equal greenness.
The lay gull is almost always young; experience amongst jockeys,
and gamblers, and money-lenders, and horsemongers, and worse
people, soon makes the º of secular fools worldly wise. But
the clerical pigeon is not seldom a mature, if not an old bird. He has
left College with a profound knowledge, perhaps, of the dead º ;
but the Hebrew therein included does not in the least render him
competent to negotiate with the posterity of JAcoB. He was never
conversant with the society of billiard-rooms, and stables, and betting
stands. His acquaintance, with men has been confined, to his pa.
rishioners; and probably he never in his life met with a greater
scoundrel than some clown who was convicted of º
And then he won’t read his Times; or, perhaps, poor fellow, with
a curacy of £80 a year, and nothing more to subsist on, he can’t afford
a newspaper. At last, picking one up by chance, his eye lights on an
advertisement offering accommodation; and, old bird as aforesaid
though he may be, he is caught by the chaff.
A Professorship of Knowſedge of the World would afford the means
of forearming by forewarning young men against the swindlers above
alluded to, and others. This instruction the Professor could convey
in a course of lectures of a familiar mature, illustrated by scenic,
and perhaps dramatic accessories. For example, the stages of a
transaction on the part of a spendthrift with a usurer *::::::::
to be a wine-merchants, might be exhibited in the form of a modern
“Mystery,” or “Morality”—though “Immorality” would perhaps be
the more appropriate term—the Professor explaining the business in
the capacity of Chorus. This union of the mediaeval with the classical,
would be congenial to both Universities—but especially. Qxford. . .
At either seat of learning how much information highly requisite,
blended with amusement equally desirable, might be supplied in an
adequate lecture on the subject of ºf a Flatl an operation about
which many scholars, as well as dunces, know so little as even to be
ignorant of the great frequency with which the hooking is connected
with a hook-nose. -
Should º be º: too idiomatic, an expression, the Pro-
fessor, might be styled the Professor of Vigilance, and in conformity
with that title, his costume might be distinguished by the species of cap
termed a wide-awake. His teaching would send University students
into the world with their eyes open. It would be a cheap substitute
for those lessons which have now generally to be bought at an exorbitant
price. It would greatly diminish the number of ordained yokels and
reverend greenhorns, to the great advantage of the Church, and to the
detriment only of the disreputable portion of the Synagogue. It would
É. Bachelors and Masters of Arts from disgracing their degrees
allowing themselves to be outwitted by those who are proficient in
the single art of roguery.
Otho Extinguished.
THAT masty little rushlight called OTHQ has been very properly put
out. It would splutter, it would splash its Greece about, it would
make itself troublesome and offensive; and France and England have
done a very sensible thing in clapping an extinguisher on the insig-
nificant but vexatious luminary.
Where is the Russian Flag?
THE flagless condition of the Russian fortresses—where no bit of
bunting waves—may, we trust, be taken as the prophetic condition of
the EMPEROR Nicholas; who, the war continuing, will in g
time not have a rag to cover him.

WASHING DAY IN THE
BALTIC.
SoME of the officers in the Baltic
have been writing home to their mam;
mas, for the means of washing and
ironing their own linen, as well as for
ample instructions how to “get up”
a it. Qne gallant youth entreats
that full directions may be ãº. him

out it, as its absence prevents him
from showing a bold—shirt-front to

It is to be regretted that the
thoughts of our naval officers should
be absorbed in the washing-tub at
such a critical moment, and there is
reason to fear that they will have too
many irons in the fire, if they are found
ironing their own collars, when they
ought to be mangling the breast-works
of the enemy. A lieutenant with his
hands in the suds can scarcely be pre-
pared for a sudden emergency, and we
would therefore recommend a nayal
hero to learn to “rough it” with his
linen as well as with everything else
while on active service.

THE SATURDAY EARLY CLOSING MOVEMENT.
THOUGH we have done much to economise labour, we have done as
yet little towards economising the labourer. We sometimes forget
that though worn-out machinery may be re-placed, the wear and tear
of the human machine may lead to mischief beyond the power of
remedy. Men should not be “used up,” as if flesh and blood were
mere clay and water, or as if the human frame, like the knitting or any
other mechanical frame, was to be regarded simply as the means of
doing, the largest possible, amount of work in the shortest, possible
period. If a man is to be treated as so much mere material, we are
apt to lose sight of the fact that his composition includes the imma-
terial, which by the way, some employers have been in the habit of
looking at in its first and lowest sense, regarding it as so thoroughly
immaterial, as to be not worth noticing. A clerk or an assistant has
been considered merely as a medium for making money, and the person
cmployed may have been intellectually a lump of lead, so that the em-
ployer could “turn all his lead to gold,” by keeping him from morning
till night at the desk or the counter.
Something has happily been done towards the shortening of the
hours of business .# the copying lawyers’ clerk, who formerly was
ept so continually face to face with
plexion did he come at last,” is now able to reach his suburban home
soon enough to enjoy an hour in that medley of infantine screams,
jingling tea-cups, and º complaints, which constitute what is
ed “the bosom of his family.” The “assistant” may now escape
an hour or two earlier from the atmosphere of gas, and may seek some
more wholesome enlightenment.
The Early Closing Movement has been followed by a rather general
motion, which we have much pleasure in seconding, for a half-holiday on
turday. Now that the Crystal Palace has opened, it is evident that
places of mere business must be occasionally shut if the industrious
classes are to benefit by an institution which will do more for popular
education, than anything that the world has yet been able to boast of
The People's Palace will become a misnomerifthe people are so confined
in workshops, warehouses, counting-houses, and offices, that none but
the comparatively idle can visit what is expressly designed for the
appreciation of the industrious. We cordially join in the demand for
a half-holiday once at least in the week, and we hope to see the time
when there may be a still greater curtailment of the hours devoted to
mere money-making P". Almost every day introduces us to
some new mode of transferring, to mere matter the work re-
quiring merely material force, and setting mind at liberty for the
Fº that “to that com-
º: of congenial objects.
e popular mind is beginnin
to know its own capacity, and,
with a natural abhorrence to a
vacuum, it seeks that which
can satisfy its yearnings.
An almost inexhaustible
store of food for the mind is
rovided at the Crystal
alace. The banquet will
have been proffered almost
in vain if the industrious
classes, who are the best
adapted to profit by it, are to
be continually kept away by
“other engagements.” En-
terprise and genius have pro-
vided a palace and a park for
the people, who will be
doomed to the fate of TAN-
TALUs if they are to be
confined to places of business,
within an easy, but to them
impassable, distance from the
Courts, Terraces, Fountains,
and Gardens of Sydenham.
A half-holiday on Saturday
is a most reasonable claim,
and if it is conceded, we
shall have to call upon the
Directors of the Crystal
Palace to choose some other
day in the week for those -
who like to enjoy, the luxury one or our contanurons at Sybashaw, and
of paying five shillings. How HE MANAGED THE GUIDE Books.

UNIMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.
ONE is often puzzled to conceive
who it is that goes to the trouble
and expense of inserting such
advertisements as we occasionally
meet with in the newspapers.
For some time the public were
being repeatedly informed, that
“THERE Is No Door MAT,” an
intimation that must have cost
several pounds to the person whº
so pertinaciously put it forward
during a rather protracted period.
Our eye has just lighted on an
announcement of a fact, which is
of such frequent occurrence, that
we should hardly have thought
it could have been worth, the
while of any one to publish it,
much less to pay for its insertion in the advertising columns of a
newspaper. e announcement to which we allude consists of the
simple words—
STOPPED–A GENTLEMAN'S GOLD WATCH.
If we knew the gentleman, we would advise him, if his watch is
stopped, to try the effect of winding it up, a remedy which is often
found effectual if the gentieman has advertised the fact of his watch
being stopped, in the hope that some kind, friend may give him a hint
ow to proceed, his object will be gained by the recommendation we
have just addressed to him. Nevertheless, should the winding ..
prove ineffectual, we would further advise the gentleman, whose watc
is stopped, to take it to some respectable watchmaker's.
IMPORTANT FROM THE SEAT OF WAR 1
LETTERS FROM THE EAST BY OUR OWN BASHI-BOZOUK.
“Camp under Redout Kale,
“MY DEAR SIR, “13th Shiboob, 1271.
“The sudden departure of my Tatar yesterday, prevented me
from making a statement which would have been as well at the com-
mencement of my correspondence, and explaining at full my reasons for
}. the Turkish army, and the peculiar means of information which
possess now I am here. O'Looney, my second in command, is also
here (the honest fellow, late an officer in the Nizam's service, is snoring
on his sheepskins within a º: of yards of me), but what means of
information does he possess? He can judge the best taps in the various
taverns of Scutari and Pera, is a connoisseur in horseflesh, and a great
consumer of raki; but he knows no more about the war than my two
black slaves which the SULTANAVALIDE gave me when I took leave of
her three weeks since at Constantinople.
“To resume my, Petersburg narrative then, and the causes of my

I have always been on terms of the most friendly and affectionate
intercourse. The Imperial treatment of me, and the scoundrell
behaviour of a certain lieutenant of police-behaviour of which
have reason to think the highest personages in the Russian, empire
were not ignorant, are the causes why I transferred my services, my
great strategetical knowledge, and my exterminating projectiles #
which the War and the world will hear terrific news ere long) to His
HighNess ABDUL.MEpween. I do not conceal that my sympathies
are not with these Turks. They mustere long be swept out of Europe.
Why should there not be an Emperor in Byzantium as well as in
Petersburg P Say he were a Russian prince. Why not? The Romanoff
of Turkey and the Romanoff of Russia would presently and infallibly
quarrel, as the French and Spanish Boughoss did... I am not particu.

coup; but his conduct towards myself, the traitorous behaviour of his
subordinates, the indignities offered to a person of royal lineage— h
thirteen dozen with the knout, administered at midnight in my rooms
at the Hôtel d'Angleterre, and a treacherous banishment into Siberia
afterwards; conduct such as this, I say, was enough to put any man
in a rage, and to justify the defiance which hereby, and in the face of
all Europe, Ihurl at the Autocrat of Russia.
“Knowing that England had set a price on my head after that
wretched affair of Ballingarry, which but for SMITH OBRIEN's foolish
quarrel about the succession to the throne with me, might have had a
very different issue,” and that my return home was impossible, the

enmity) might be inconvenient.
EMPEROR had made me advantageous proposals for entering into his
service-proposals which I do not scruple to say I had entertained.
The Grand Cross of the Russian St.George might have figured advan-
tageously on a bosom which beats with only a chivalrous enmity against
the Cappadocian warrior, who is England’s patron. The rank of
Generaſ and Marshal (on old Paskºwitch's retirement) might
gratify an honest ambition, and the title of Mulliganoff-Innisfailsky,
of which the patent was actually made out, might be worn without
shame, º one whose loftier claims and regal rights have been reft from
him by the evil chance of war.
“But when war was declared between the EMPEROR and the three
kingdoms, there was one of them, as I told his Majesty, against which
I never would fight. Unaccustomed for the last thirty years to contra-
diction from any quarter, you never saw a man in a greater rage than

who happened to be in the room, was absolutely humiliating. The en-

part, have always preferred to face a thousandguns in º than the
tears of a loving woman. Every gentleman will understand the agonies
I felt in my battle with one who had been so victorious over my
eart.
“My †: with his Majesty and my rejection of his proposals took
place on the very day, I think it was the 18th of January last, when
that poor deputation of Quakers, as you remember, had their final
interview with the despotic ruler over sixty millions of men. That the
EMPEROR is a master of dissimulation is clear, not only from certain
documents which have come to light subsequently, but from his beha-
viour towards those honest broad-brimmed gentlemen whom he most
imperially bamboozled., They and, I lodged at the same hotel, the
Hôtel d’Angleterre, on the Nepomuk Platz; and with one of the junior
members of the peaceful party, an agreeable lively fellow, youn
DoBKINs, of Godmanchester, I became rather intimate. I introduce
him to the Guards' barracks, took him about the town to the public
places, and presented him in some of the most fashionable houses,
where “le beau quakre,” as he was called, was a considerable favourite.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Out of his ridiculous costume, which he only wore on parade, he was
an exceedingly handsome young fellow, not a little, like myself, as the
dear MATILDA insisted, though I am some nine inches broader between
the shoulders, and twelve inches less in the waist than my young
broad-brimmed acquaintance.
“We F. several merry evenings, and had rather a pleasant
table d'hôte at the Hôtel d'Angleterre, where, however, there was
one guest who, for private reasons, as well as for his own disgusting
behaviour, was especially odious to me; this was no other than the
notorious Count TUFFSKIN, who is known at every gambling house in
Europe, who is at present commandant at Tamboff, and had come to
the capital to solicit promotion; and what is more, to dispute with me
the hand of the lovely MATILDA SchouzoFF. He slept in the apart-
ment, No. 7, contiguous to my rooms, No. 8, on the second floor:
many a time have 1 heard the fellow snoring, whilst I myself was
j my chamber (haply turning verses in honour of MATILDA), and
onged to go in, and strangle my rival. MATILDA's mother was on my
side, whilst her father, from old family connection, inclined towards
TUFFSKIN.
“His ExcELLENCY PRINCE SchouzoFF is President of the secret
Correctional Police of St. Petersburg, an institution which everybody
knows and fears in that capital, and nobody talks about. As F.
broken with the Romanoff Court, there is no reason why I should keep
the secret or hesitate to divulge the scandal. Some years sinee in your
own paper I remember there was a jocular account of a Russian, dig-
nitary in London being awakened in his apartments at LoNG's or
MIvan T's, or it may have been GRILLION’s, but the hotel does not matter,
by four drummers of the Preobajenski regiment, who entered his room
disguised as waiters, and then and there gave him three dozen each,
taking his receipt for the same. . Every word of that narrative is true;
there's scarcely a man in Petersburg but for some offence to the Court
he has had a visit from the Secret Correctional Police. What was the
meaning at the commencement of the present season of CHAMBERLAIN
X. keeping his bed, and PRINCE Y's lumbago? This discipline is so
Common, º decisive, that nobody dare speak of it above his
breath, and it is dreadful to think how many of this proud nobility have
had a taste of the rattan.
“I have spoken before of this degrading F. having been
conferred upon me—upon me the descendant o i. the inheritor and
representative of centuries of honour! not actually, for had I received a
blow, the Chief of the House of Romanorr or that of M. would
now be no more; but in intent the insult remains to be terribly avenged,
though the degrading knout descended upon the shoulders of another.
“The thing was the talk of Petersburg, as Petersburg talks—under
its breath—and what really happened was º this. Count TUFF.
sKIN, like too many of the Russian nobility, indulges in the habit of
frequent inebriation, and on the night after that painful morning and
interview in which I had resigned the EMPEROR's service, TUFFSKIN,
myself, one or two of the younger Quakers, and a few more habitués of
the hotel, partook of a farewell supper. ft was Wednesday, and our
Quaker friends were to go on Friday, [and gave us the last evening
which was free. -
“During the supper I received a little mote—blessings be on the
hand!—which I read, kissed, and put in my pocket, not heeding the
vulgar jokes of TUFFskIN, and despising his low satire.
“He had already drank several bottles of Clicquot. I now pressed
him with brandy; the wretch drank until he was perfectly intoxicated,
when I took him, reeling and senseless, and conducted him to bed.
“I put him into my room, No. 7 | has a beautiful prospect over
the § four bridges, the Naval Arsenal, the Pauloff Palace, and
the Neuskoi Prospekt). The house is dear, but perhaps the best in
Petersburg.) I put TUFFSKIN into my room, No. 7, and into my bed:
and I went into his room, No. 8.
“At two o'clock in the morning, when the house was hushed, I heard
the tramp of men on the corridor; it was the secret Correctional Police.
“At five minutes past two, No. 9, YoUNG Dobkins, the Quaker before
mentioned, put his head out of his bed chamber door, but was thrust
back by a sentinel posted there, and told to mind his own business.
. . . . He had heard piercing shrieks proceeding from No. 7.
“They were administering the knowt to TUFFSKIN, mistaking him for
your “BASHI-Bozouk.”
Echo answers “Police."
THE Opera season—perhaps on account of the heat that prevails, or
ought to prevail, at the time of year-is usually marked by some
eccentricities of a more or less painful character. Perhaps the most
distressing result that has yet ensued may be seen in the two following
questions which have recently been put to us:-
1. 5 * scene of MozART's Seraglio laid in Serra-Lion (Sierra

JUDICIAL BUTTER,
WE like a loyal judge, but we do not like to see a Chief Justice
turning himself into a butter-boat for the purpose of pouring out a
º of melted butter over the Royal family. In the Queen's
ench, the other day, there was a thorough inundation of what may be
familiarly termed “sweet sauce”—for we may be allowed to apply the
term “sauce” to that which savoured somewhat of impertinence. An
action had been brought with reference to some property belonging to
the Duchy of Cornwall, and the Attorney-General said, very properly,
that "the desire of those acting for the PRINCE of WALEs was to
prevent any noxious trade being carried on there.”. There had, it
seems...been a bone-boiling business carried on, and the desire to get
rid of it was, no doubt, laudable; but we think it hardly justified the
following flood of melted butter from the mouth of LoRD CAMPBELL:—
“If one could suppose,” said his Lordship, “that HIs Roy AL HIGHNEss THE PRINCE
of WALEs knew the premises it would do the greatest honour to his youthful mind
that he should use his influence to put a stop to these nuisances.”
The PRINCE OF WALEs is a very amiably disposed little fellow, and
will, in due time, do all that is expected of him, we dare say; but it
requires a considerable stretch of the imagination to fancy him
wandering about the, wharves on the Lambeth side of the Thames, in
the hope of “nosing” out a nuisance. It is not to be expected that his
Royal Highness should be permitted to ramble amid the mud of the
metropolitan marsh, with a view to * a bone to pick with a bone-
boiler, who may happen to be one of the tenants of the Duchy of
Cornwall. The Attorney-General, evidently feeling the absurdity of
the supposition that the action could reflect “the greatest honour on
the youthful mind of the PRINCE of WALEs,” at once gave the merit
where it was due, and stated that, “his Royal father, PRINCE ALBERT,
was aware of the state of that neighbourhood, and was most anxious
that no noxious trade should be carried on upon these premises.”
This hint was enough for LoRD CAMPRELI, whose º of melted
butter was by no means exhausted, and he immediately proceeded to
butter PRINCE ALBERT in the following fashion:—
“His Lordship said it did HIs Royal Highwass Pance Alsenr the highest honour
that he should take an interest in such things; it was most praiseworthy and laudable,
and must be very gratifying to all persons.'
We all know that the judicial bench is, in these days, quite in-
corruptible; but adulation is ill suited to its dignity. LORD CAMPBELL
no doubt meant to be very complimentary; but, if we were a royal
personage, we should deem ourselves yery little flattered by its being
; nº to take especial notice of our having done a simple
act 01 duty.
PROWERBS IMPROVED.
INSTEAD of “as clear as mud,” say, “as clear as the Thames.”
Instead of “as like as chalk is to cheese,” say rather “as like as
London milk is to cheese.”
Don't say “as thick as thieves,” but “lawyers.”
In the same way, throw in “two aldermen,” when you wish to say
“two swallows do not make a summer.” .
Similarly, if you wish “to provide for a rainy day,” you can allude to
that aquatic period much more elegantly, by saying “when Vauxhall
opens.
Likewise, in lieu of saying, “When you are at Rome you must do|h
as they do at Rome,” the same thing will be better expressed by
§. in Oxford; viz., “When you are at Oxford, do as they do at
ford”—which is every inch as good as going to Rome.
Talking of Rome, and the long time it took to build, you can improve
the same expression by mildly suggesting that “The Houses of Parlia-
ment were not built in a day.”
We will end with a small batch of “Improved Proverbs,” as being
better adapted to the superior intelligence of the present day.
Let every Punster stick to his Last.
Ill news travels } an Electric º:
You mustn't teach the Morning Herald to suck eggs.

A MINISTERIAL WARMING-PAN.
VERYBODY has heard of a certain
“Manager STRUTT,” who was once
famed in song; but the STRUTT of
the present day seems likely to
obtain celebrity for his manageable
qualities rather than for his manage-
ment. , Warming-pans are rather
out of fashion in every-day life, but
such an article appears still to be
useful as part of the furniture of
Downing Street. MR. STRUTT has
been, evidently selected by his late
amiable and excellent colleagues,
for the task of keeping warm a
place that some one else is destined
to occupy. The great merit of this
gentleman as a Ministerial Warming-
pan consists in his excessive .
ness, and equality of temper, which
prevents the probability that those who meddle with him will burn
their fingers. The good-natured and ousted STRUTT will henceforth
find himself free to devote himself to any kind of, amusement, and, if
he §. to those “Sports and Pastimes” with which the name
of STRUTT has long been honourably identified. Never was there a
more accommodating colleague, for no treatment “puts him out”—not
even the getting rid of him.
THE BISHOP OF LONDON'S FLOCK IN THE CITY.
WE should like to know who dares to say that the Church in the
City, is without a flock, when anybody who walks or rides in an
omnibus to St. Paul’s may see a regular flock º: on the stunted
grass that scarcely affords a decent covering to the graves in the church-
yard. It is true that the flock does not seem to profit much by what
they pick up at the Cathedral, and the sheep of the Bishop of London's
fold appear to be in need of some, immediate pastoral aid to improve
their pasture. Besides the unpleasantness, attending the idea of
rearing multon on the crop grown from the decaying remains of mor-
tality, we find something disagreable in the notion that perhaps the
sheep are taken into the churchyard to graze with the same sordid
motive that actuates those who . horses in to bait or stand at livery.
We must confess that the sheep in St. Paul's Churchyard resemble
those skeleton animals that flit through the air in Der Freischütz to the
dismal chorus of “Uhui!” and if a set of mischievous boys at midnight
were to raise the melancholy cry of “Uhui!” through the palings of
St. Paul's, the spectral appearance of the sheep in the churchyard, under
the solemn shadow of the dome, would almost realise the horrors of the
incantation scene as represented in the D Lane Qpera. -
| Imagination would easily conjure up a chorus of charity children,
|with a wild hunt of skeleton curates, and a compound of other horrors,
to which the sheep, “lazily mumbling the bones of the dead,” furnish á
foreground of melancholy aspect. We earnestly entreat the Bishop
or LoNDON, the DEAN of St. PAUI's, or any canon who may be in
authority, to put an end at once to the beggarly contract with the
butcher, by which a few half-starved sheep, are suffered to disfigure
fººd ground by their hungry munchings of the graveyard
erbage.
MALARIA IN WESTMINSTER HALL.
THE papers tell us that a few days ago while the Court of Queen's
Bench was engaged in hearing a special argument, so great a stench,
apparently coming from the drains, arose in the building that
“MR. JUsTICE Cole RIDGE said, out of regard for the health of all present, the
business must be at once adjourned, and the Court was adjourned accordingly.”
Surely something ought to be done to prevent Westminster. Hall
from “savouring” so very much of “the realty” as to “stink in the
nostrils” of all present. e cannot understand how there can be any
difficulty about thorough drainage, but if the task is arduous, why not
retain two or three barristers, who from the effect they*::::::: on the
pockets of their clients, must be considered capable of draining any-
thing. MR. JUSTICE Coreange is one of our best and ablest judges,
but with all his experience at the Old Bailey, where he is accustomed to
that which smells rank and offensive, he could not tolerate the effluvium
that arose in Westminster Hall. We presume the “special argument”
that was in progress, had nothing to do with the stench, though we
should be able to judge more accurately on this point if we knew the
name of the Counsel engaged on the occasion, for some barristers, we
regret to say, are excessively foul-mouthed. We recommend the
Judges to order that the Courts be provided with disinfecting fluid,
which may be useful in cases of defective drainage, or after the speech
of one of those learned gentlemen who are notorious for their disagree.
able airs, and for bringing the profession of the law into very bad odour.
