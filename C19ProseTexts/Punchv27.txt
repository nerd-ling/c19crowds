his own room, 85, Fleet Street, complacently turned over the leaves, the faces, alive and glancing; and
smiling, and bobbing heads, and mouths curving, and eye-brows lifting, a thousand faces, thousands of
features, vital, animated MR. PUNCH reverently closed the book; that he might consider the binding.
For MR. PUNch’s Twenty-Seventh Volume was to be placed for all time on a shelf of polished British oak
in the Royal Library of France; an offering to the alliance that in the year of manful daring, was consecrated
by the mingled blood of both nations.
The book—we have said it—was significantly bound. On one cover was emblazoned the lions of
England in heraldic field; on the other the honey-bees of sunny France Strength and sweetness were
here together; even as the honey in the lion of Samson.
And thus were England and France bound together, with nothing but good fellowship, and give-
and-take jest and good humour—written and symbolised in the leaves of PUNch—between them. And as

iy - PREFACE.
MR. PUNCH sat in his easy chair—(it was never easier, for his Almanack was done, and like
summer swallows, had flown away in tens and tens of thousands, twittering promises of sunshine, and
fruits, and flowers)—sat, and pondered the when and the how MR. PUNch, with his encyclopaedic brow
in his hand sat and—slept. Forty winks—only forty winks
MR. Punch crosses the Channel; halcyons on the wave, and laughing mermaids lifting up their
pocket-mirrors that therein MR. PUNch might behold his glorious face |
MR. Punch lands at Boulogne; his Volume under his arm. A very storm of silver sounds blown
from silver trumpets greets his landing. Fishwomen, with coal-black, fiery eyes, and faces fresh as sea-
breezes, rush with one accord; catch him in their arms, and carry him to the railway,+French ladies
from windows and balconies raining on him roses.
The train is off-and at the Paris station Mr. Punch is met by the MAYor of PARIs and all the
municipal authorities. The Mayor, having paid his first compliments, asked where was Lord Moon, his
cher confrère and contemporain * MR. PUNCH, with the candour that has ever glorified his character,
observes that he had come to bask in the Sum of Austerlitz, and cared not to remember the Moon of
Portsoken. “C'est fort bien,” said the MAYor of PARIs; and MR. PUNCH ascended a triumphal car
drawn by eight white horses to the Hotel de Ville.
There never was such a banquet—and, perhaps, Mr. PUNCH was never so eloquent. At the proper
time he rose, and presenting his Volume (through the MAYok of PARIs) to the People of France,
begged to be allowed to hope that the affections, feelings, and interests of the two countries might
continue for ever bound together, even as the leaves of Punch were bound and enclasped by the arms
of Britain and Gaul.
On this, there was a salvo of cannon that—put an end to MR. PUNch’s forty winks. Never-
theless he resolved to go straightway to Paris that his dream might become a verity.
LoRD CLARENDoN having heard of MR. PUNch’s determination begged that he would charge himself
with the blue riband for GENERAL CANRob ERT, the same riband that bound him and his brother hero,
RAGLAN ; symbolizing the mutual wishes of England and France that so, for all time, they might be
tied up in glory and in friendship. -

TUFFSKIN flayed alive, and myself burning with indignation at an
insult which, though it had fallen on Count TUFFSKIN’s shoulders, had
been intended for me. MATILDA SchouzoFF–beautiful, beloved, faithless
MATILDA-had rescued me from that peril: she had got an inkling, on the
previous evening from the Police Minister, her father, of the fate that
was destined for me.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
matists that it was best for me to make no noise about the business,
and to walk the streets as if nothing had happened.
“That afternoon, about two o'clock, I was standing before JACOB's
the printseller's shop, talking and joking with young ALEXIS MIRO-
LADow Ax; who should pass us in his brown Droschki, in which the
etiquette is never to recognise him, but the EMPEROR himself I
happened to be cracking with laughter at one of ALEXIS's stories (a
very * one about my friend Count CANCRIM) when his Majesty

p “A man who had been flayed alive at two o'clock in the morning
shaking his sides with laughter on the Alexander Platz, at two in the
afternoon—here was a strange occurrence The EMPEROR looked at me
as if I had been a ghost: i. turned quite livid when he saw me. I
appeared to take no notice, laughed and chatted on with ALEXIS, and
pretended to be looking at the brass statue of ST. GREGORIUS NAZIAN-
ZENUs, which stands in the Place.
“Gallant men never kiss and tell, so I leave such to imagine the
rapturous meeting which took place that evening in the blue saloon of
the Winter Palace between me and my lovely rescuer—the pressure of
the hand, which, though but momentary, causes the frame to thrill
with happiness—the rapid flºº. of the eye, more eloquent than a
thousand speeches. Oh! MATILDA 1 Can it be that you have for-
gotten me so soon, and for a Qu--; but I am advancing matters—
no woman could be fonder or truer than MATILDA was then.
“It was, I have said, a Thursday evening, the night of the Empress’s
weekly reception, Our Quaker friends, had come to take leave; th
were to depart indeed before it was light the next morning, and
recollect MATILDA asking me why young MR. DoDKINs was not present,
whom I had introduced to her family, from which he had received great
and constant attention. The young Quaker is a man of enormous
wealth, and I recollect MATILDA and myself counting up, in roubles,
the amount of the income which he receives in pounds sterling for his
share of the business.
“I laughed. I supposed DoDKINs wanted to keep his moustaches,
did not care to ſace his uncle, old JED EDIAH. DoDKINs, who with
some of the old members of the deputation, lived with an old friend, a
serious tallow merchant on the English Quay.
“I went into the Imperial presence with the rest, and made my bow
to their Majesties. The dear Empress, I thought, turned away her
head from me with a very mournful expression, whereas the Autocrat
looked as black as thunder. I did not mind his black looks; made my
obeisance, and retired presently into the Yº. and silver drawing-room,
where FALcoxNET’s silver bust of the EMPREss CATHERINE stands,
and where the Maids-of-Honour commonly sit and have tea; it is ex-
ceedingly good at St. Petersburg, as everybody knows, and I drank
º Or #. and twenty cuffs whilst chattering with these charming
Iris.
“Presently I saw MATILDA coming, with a look of great anxiety in
her face; she beckoned me to speak to her, and I followed her into the
embrasure of the window, in which the CUPID and PsychE stands
looking out on the Tolstoi Square. -
“‘Oh, my MULLIGANovitch,” she said, “my Njni, my Moujik, my
Caviare, my M-, my beautiful, my brave, my best beloved, I have:
dreadful news for you? -
“‘Speak, cushla ma chree na boclish,” says, l, (the Celtic, and the
Sclavonic dialects are very similar), seizing her lovely hand, and pressing
it to my beating waistcoat; “speak, light of my eyes, and tell me what
is the matter.” - - -
“‘You asked for passports for Prussia this morning at the Police
Office, and they were promised to you.’ -
… . They were, adored creature; will you fly with me?’
“‘Oh MULLIGANOVITCH, (such a heavenly expression of the eyes
here) you will never be allowed to depart to Prussia: to-morrow at ten
o'clock, somebody who tells me everything—get away you jealous
creature, and don't be jealous of him, or doubt your poor little MATILDA,
—informs me that you will be seized and sent to Siberia: you are con-
sidered as a naturalized Russian subject. The EMPEROR laughed for a
moment when he heard of poor Count TUFFskIN being mistaken for
you. Oh, dear, dear MULliga Novitch, I could not sleep all night for
thinking of what might befal you; but after his laugh, ſe grew more
angry than ever, and had it not been for the Empress going on her
knees to him this very evening, the horrid operation would have been
performed on you.’ -
“I ground my teeth, crunching between them the execration which
otherwise had issued from my lips. To be sent to Siberia—the
thought was madness!
“‘Ladies are not allowed to go there,” sobbed out MATILDA,
divining the causes of my emotion: “they will separate me from my
MULLIGANovitch ; they will marry me to that horrid tipsy TUFFSKI : *
“I don’t know what I ..",
and joy had not MATILDA’s mamma called her at this very juncture, and
left me to contemplate my fate, and (to quote the beautiful words of
GENERAL Wolfe), bitterly think of the morrow.

TEMPERANCE IN TRUTH,
“THE mixture of a lie ever pleaseth,” says LoRD BAcon; un-
fortunately for himself, a sad authority for the truthfulness of th
saying. he Scotch are a nation of philosophers. There is in
Edinburgh many a philosopher, who, like DIOGENES, would live in a
tub—if the tub were made a whiskey-cask inside, with “water-cask” in
large letters painted externally. It must be confessed that teetotallers
are, at times, terribly ºf in water; especially in that particular
water drawn from the well of truth. Truth’s bucket is as hateful to
their nostrils as though it reeked with the penal fires, of Islay or
|Glenlivat. But, like DIOGENES, they are philosophers, and can lie very
comfortably in every sort of cask.
The folks of Glasgow, it seems, rejoice in a new local act—may it
remain national with them as the national thistle!—that forbids the
furnishing not only of drink, but of meat, to any man, woman, or child,
hungering for a tavern dinner, unless the man, woman, or child, afore.
said, are indwellers of the hostelry, sleeping there !
What is the consequence, as related in the Times, by an authenticated
correspondent Two men are starving for a dinner. They enter a
tayern; are resolutely denied the meal; but at length obtain it, by
taking beds for the night! They are permitted the use of knife and
fork under the fiction, that they are to wear nightcaps | . They are
allowed to have a fowl for dinner, on the lie that they take with it,
goose-feathers. Such are the beds of Justice in Scotland at this hour;
most truly of Justice, for here she must sleep in them; sleep the sleep
of whiskey—the sleep of temperance, temperate of truth !
Doctor LATHAM, in his Handbook to the Courts of Natural History
for the Crystal Palace, gives specimens of certain savages, who thrust
pieces of wood through the lobes of their ears; and cause the most
unnatural projection of the under lip, as offerings to their sense of the
beautiful. "Are there no unsophisticated folks who, in the same way,
sacrifice to their sense of truth?, who project the lip with a Phari.
saical lie; and to prove that they do not take the toddy-ladle to their
own mouths, insist upon thrusting it through the lobes of their neigh-
bours' ears? We wish Doctor LATHAM would add a specimen or
two from the natives of Caledonia.
THE WRITING-MASTER AT THE HOME-OFFICE.
LoRD PAIMERSTON in addition to the many matters he has on his
own hands, has been directing his energies to the hands written by
those who are under him. It is perfectly natural that the bottle-holder
should object to such “fists” as he has occasionally met with in his
correspondence at the Home Office. He has accordingly dealt out a
few raps on the knuckles, the effect of which will, we trust, be satis-
factory. The next thing for his Lordship to do will be to issue
appropriate copies to the various departments of the Government.
We can imagine a few of those sentences for copy-books, which in
lººd position of moralist and minister, would most probably occur
to him :—
Eril communications corrupt good Lord John Manners.
If Sibthorp's bliss, ’tis folly to be other-icise.
It’s a long political life that has no furning.
Government waste makes National want.
The Duke of Decanters.
WHEN the KING of Portugal, and his brother, the DUKE of
OPorto, partook of the meat-breakfast, genteclly called dºjeviner a la
fourchette, at the Mansion House the other day, there were, as we are
| informed, some curious wines on the table. To the DUKE of OpoRTo
the most curious of these wines appeared, we believe, a purple sort of
wine, if it can be called wine, nearly as strong as brandy; and we have
good reason for stating, that the Duke's astonishment was excessive
when his Royal Highness was told that this liquor was the produce of
his own dukedom. We trust that the DUKE of OpoRTO's visit to the
Mansion House will be followed by results advantageous to the Port
of London, and consequently to that of England.
An Evil Liver.
THEY say that Nicho!. As is labouring under a liver affection—the
only sort of affection of which his nature is capable. It appears, there-
fore, that the Czar is troubled with bile; and there can be no doubt
that he complains bitterly of Gaul.

REST.
AGAINST MR. HuME’s mo-
tion for a resolution
that the moral and in-
tellectual improvement
of the working classes
would be promoted by
the opening of collec-
tions of natural history
and objects of art, as
well as gin-shops, after
morning service on a
Sunday, there seems
only one thing to be
º which is, that
Sunday ought to be
observed literally as a
day of rest; so that the
is working classes during
the intervals between
the services ought to
go to sleep. As sleep
at will, however, is
not procurable without
the aid of some nar-
cotic drug, or influence,
MR. Hume's opponents
should suggest some
- scheme for supplying
the public with cheap opium, or for establishing district mesmerizers. For # the
population cannot go to Church, and all would certainly not be sent to slee
there, and though many might, yet very few sermons would have such an º
drowsy effect as to plunge the hearers in slumber for all the rest of the day.
A DAY - OF ABSOLUTE
“A MISSIONARY CHURCH.”
MR. HENLEY conscientiously objected to the clause that, in the
University Bill, allows academical honours to stiff-necked Dissenters. As they
would not swear and subscribe to articles, wherefore should they have glorifying
letters affixed to their names? These literal honours ought to remain the exclu-
sive reward of the members of the Established Church as a very trifling com-
º for the unceasing care and interest bestowed by that Church upon all
uman souls; the more especially on those errant, vagabond souls that were
wont to remain unclaimed, going here and there, and nowhere, altogether
heedless of the sheep-bell tinkling to the Church flock. MR HENLEY objected
to the clause, and the hon. (and revolutionary) gentleman who proposed it must
recollect that—
“It was the duty of our Established Church to look after those who would not look after them-
selves. The Established Church was a Missionary Church to a large portion of the people. He
moved as an amendment, that the clause be read a second time that day six months.”
Oxford
But the clause—the door-opening clause-was, to the consternation of
MR. HENLEY, and his fellow-labourers in the cause of the Established Church,
º and the Missionary Church mightily wronged and scandalised thereby.
e Established Church was a Missionary Church to a large portion, of the
people. This affecting fact explains to us the constant practice of so many bishops
and archdeacons, and prebends and deans, whom we continually meet in alleys
and ys—and always where the poor and ignorant swarm the thickest—in a
sort of lowly Fº their º: tempted and drawn to the abodes of
squalor and of vice. Note we know why the Bishop gr LoNDoN himself is so
uently met with, in Spitalfields, in Lambeth—on Mutton Hill–in, infidel
St. Giles's. He is the model Missionary of a Missionary Church; and he con-
demns and eschews, all the Church dramas as produced, regardless of expense
at St. Barnabas and St. Paul's, tº: all his heart and all his
soul to look after those of the straying flock, who “will not look after themselves.”
lgravia is safe in the piety of her own estimation, but Tothill-fields is running
to weeds, choked by cockle and darmel. May Fair smells her Church flowers,
and sniffs the odour of piety, from Roman roses; but Rag Fair has not a single
leaf of the Herb of Grace wherewith to scent and sweeten the foul earthiness of
her fallen nature; and therefore it is to Rag Fair and not to May Fair—to the
Place of Tatters, and not to the Feast of Roses, that, our. BioMFIELD-sweety-
smelling syllables!—takes his missionary way, and with silver voice to the
careless, scattered flºck. - -
The Established Church is, then, the real Missionary Church. Here and there a
Dissenter or two may Nº. and redeem a black or copper-skinned barbarian-
rejoicing in the treasure o º and Patagonian proselyte—but it is the Bishop
of Loxton, and such as he, who, wanderingforth in the savage places of the British
metropolis, callin and secure the wandering sheep whose footsteps would otherwise
print their way to perdition!

LORD ABERDEEN'S EXPLANATION.
It’s very hard, and so it is,
o be misrepresented
By a set of low press-writers,
Ill-informed and discontented.
So here I am upon my legs
To offer explanation,
(Though of what there is to be explained
Ipause for information.)
Thiſ say I’m Russian-minded–
The charge is quite ridiculous;
'Tis five and twenty years ago
Since I pitched info Nicholas;
Took the liberty to Nessel Rode
Those same harsh truths to state, my Lords,
Which I checked LoRDLYNDHurst, t'othernight,
For advancing in debate, my Lords.
If I now say Russia strives not
For extension of dominion,
You'll find in my despatch, my Lords,
The opposite opinion.
In twenty-nine I was in fact
Courageously asserting out
The verythings low writers now
Areignorantly blurting out.
'Tis true Isaid, the other night,
feared not fuss encroar ment;
But you’ll find my words, in twenty-nine,
Another view to broach meant;
I doubt if loºp CLANRICARDE,
In his present most rash line, my Lords,
E'er unmasked Russ double-dealing
More than I-in twenty-nine, my Lords.
Yanshall see the germ of treachery
Pointed out in that despatch, my Lords,
Which your LAYARDs and your LyxpHURsts
Say the Czarnow tries to hatch, my Lords.
And if my words in fifty-four,
To my words in twenty-nine, my Lords,
Are found to be as black to white,
Why that’s no fault of mine, my Lords.
To political necessities
Opinions must i. o'er, my Lords;
And the state of things in twenty-nine;
Was not that in fifty-four, my Lords.
Then I abused the Russians,
But from fi º forbore with them;
Now I defend the Russians,
But then we are at war with them.
But you need not be alarmed, my Lords,
Lest this should check our action;
If I’ve deprecated war, my Lords,
(As I own with satisfaction,)
If my speeches in the house have worn
The tone of Russian pleadings,
In the Cabinet I’ve always urged
The most vigorous proceedings.
For my effort it has always been
To exert my ingenuity
In keeping up 'twixt words and acts
A wholesome incongruity. -
Large words and great deeds too, is waste
At which my Scotch heart bleeds, my Lords,
So pray allow me to sing small,
While England does great deeds, my Lords,
The Bashful Muscovite.
THERE is a great deal of truthin what Loºp ABERDEEN
says. We ought not to be too hard upon the EMPERoR
Nicholas. People have hastily accused him of unscru-
whereas, by evacuating the Principali
himself as quite a retiring character
Should ABERDEEN HAVE A STATUE *-Certainly he
should—the “statu quo ante.”

THE PREVISION OF PUNCH.
MR. PUNCH has never been mesmerised, and rendered cataleptic, or
a somnambulist. It is impossible to throw into a state of sleep one so
constitutionally wide-awake. In short, the clairvoyance of Mr. Punch
is natural lucidity. The faculty of clear-sight is nevertheless possessed
by Mr. Punch, in a much higher degree than what would suffice to
enable him to perceive, through his office wall, what might be going on
in the adjoining establishment. Recent accounts from Russia represent
the EMPEROR of that country as being afflicted with a bad leg, a
“mind diseased,” and a pertinacious liver complaint., Everybody, who
knows anything of. ºś will infer that the bad leg and the
disordered intellect in all probability depend on the diseased liver. Did
not Mr. Punch, before the war, when hostilities, were only imminent,
declare his conviction that their outbreak would be the eruption of
the Czar's internal evils: that the insane course which NICHOLAs, was
#. was the consequence of a mental affection, arising from abilious
isorder? Did he not even suggest blue pill? The few locks which
adorn the head of Mr. Punch are now in the state of the quills of the
“fretful porcupine.” He is, like PROFEssoR KATTERFELTo with his
hair on end, wondering at his own, wonders. But what is the use of
wondering at the high truths of medical philosophy? . It were better to
apply them; and save, with a few grains of merc pill, an immense
quantity of human blood.
The Game of Russia.
STRATEGY is generally considered to resemble Chess; but the retro-
de movement of the Russians across the Pruth looks rather like
ack-Gammon.
Q. WHY is the drum in an orchestra like the Government?
A. Because it is beaten almost every night.
ALL THE FUN OF THE FIELD.
IN the course of a recent tour through a rural, district, a corres-
ondent informs us, that he met with as many as three jokes. These
facetia, were all, included in one field, namely, a wheat field, and they
consisted, each, in two bundles of cornstalks twisted into ropes, and
tied across a narrow path i.", the crop, by which ingenious ar-
rangement an rson walking that way in the twilight would be
tripped up, and the result would be a bit of fun-no less, perhaps, than
the fracture of his legs, or nose, or skull. Being a stolid kind of person,
our correspondent destroyed these jokes with his walking-stick. He
could not concur with the rustic mind in considering breaking a limb
to be cracking a joke, and did not reflect that by hindering somebody
or other from getting crippled, he spoiled sport.
MURDER FROM THE FRENCH.
WE trust that our French visitors will be taken to the Princess's
Theatre, in order to observe the great reverence with which murder

LAW AND LINDLEY MURRAY.
T is generally, thought that the
recedent set by one of our most
#ji nglish Judges, in
not only giving judgment, upon
the merits of a case tried before
him, but in deciding upon the
right pronunciation of a word
used in the pleadings, has given
great satisfaction. A series of
cases has since been heard, in
which various offenders against
the laws of language have been
amerced in divers penalties. The
following is a report of Satur-
day’s sittings:–
COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH. -
(Sittings in Banco.)
LoRD CAMPBELL, at three
o'clock, said that the paper having
now been gone through, he an
his brothers were ready to take any cases of bad language.
Several Barristers immediately left the Court. It was observed that
some of them were gentlemen who had obtained notoriety by abusing
unfortunate coroners and other magistrates of limited powers of
committal.
THE QUEEN v. Lord JoHN RUSSELL.
The defendant was charged with habitually offending, against HER
MAJESTY's English, by making a noise sounding like “obleege,” when
he was supposed to intend to say “oblige.”
The defendant pleaded guilty, but urged that a hundred years †
#. pronunciation was the fashionable one. It was derived from the
renon.
LoRD CAMPBELL said, that in the case of John KEMBLE v. the
PRINCE REGENT the dictum had been, “It would become your Royal
mouth better to say “oblige.” The rule was clear. Had the defendant
anything further to say? - -
The defendant said that he had once visited the Lyceum Theatre
% *} lºud MR. FRANK MATTHEws say, in a burlesque called
zz Lioda- -
“With any advice about the siege,
The Field-Marshal therefore cannot obleege.”
LORD CAMPBELL said that this proved that the defendant had been
warmed. The object of burlesque—and he was bound to say that such
object was usually attained—was to ridicule what was absurd, by push:
ing absurdity to the extreme. The Court did not desire to be hard
upon the defendant. Would he undertake not to repeat the offence #
The defendant said that he would endeavour to conform to the
customs of the day; but he believed that in Magna Charta-
He was here somewhat hastily removed from the Court.
THE QUEEN v. RICHARD COBDEN.
The defendant was charged with laying a false emphasis upon the
third syllable in the word inimical, which he pronounced inimical.
The defendant said that he had not intended to give offence, and that
he º heard the same pronunciation from the Treasury Bench last
week.
LoRD CAMPBELL said that the Treasury had better go to its “Tyronis
Thesaurus.” (Laughter, in which nobody joined.) The pronunciation
was pedantic—why did not the defendant say severity and urbanity?
The defendant was discharged with a caution.
THE QUEEN v. THIRTEEN CABMEN.
The defendants were charged with having said they were going to
drive to the Adelphi Theâter.
The police gave evidence that this abominable pronunciation was of
common occurrence, and gave great annoyance to the aristocratic
classes on their way to the opera. - - - -
The defendants said that it was the ordinary pronunciation of the
ing and lower orders.
LoRD CAMPBELL said that it was intolerable, and sentenced the
whole of the defendants to be civil to their fares for an entire month.
The defendants were removed, one of them remarking that the sen-
tence would be the death of him.
THE QUEEN v. THE HON. ALFRED LAZYTONGS.
The defendant was charged with having used continuous bad lan-
guage through a whole afternoon, at the Conservative Club. He was
| accurate, and the vehicle for good sense or true wit.
proved to have said that the rain was a baw, that MADEMOISELLE
LUTHER was a charming creechaw, that LoRD DERby had come out
strong about Canadaw, and that his, defendant’s, tigaw was a deuced
sharp little fellaw. - -
Several old members of the club pressed for a severe punishment, as
they said that the offence was so common as to render the place quite
unbearable. The *i. went lounging about in their all-round
collars, gobbling out the most ridiculous sounds, and fancying they
were talking.
The defendant hoped that the Court would think it didn’t mattaw
what a parcel of red-faced old pumps thought on the subject.
LoRD CAMPBELL, said that...extraneous matter had been imported
into the case on both sides. The Court had no jurisdiction over collars
or red faces. But the defendant stood self-convicted. What had he
to say : -
The defendant said that a gentleman liked to speak differently from
vulgarians, and as the latter º the QUEEN’s English upon all
. it was the duty of a loyal subject to make as much of it as
possible.
LoRD CAMPBELL said that the defence was plausible, but would not
. The proper way for a gentleman to render his language different
from that of vulgarians was to take care that it was º: º
As the de-
fendant seemed desirous to do what was right, he would accept his
own bail for his reappearance that day month, conditionally on his
reading Punch for one hour every day, during the intermediate time.
The defendant gladly gave the undertaking, and was discharged.
- 4. ºmnus cases presented little of principle and ºis of
Interest.
WEEPING BIRCH.
WIsITANTs to Westminster Abbey have of late been greatly alarmed
and excited by supernatural movements exhibited by the monument of
DR. Busby, considerably more striking than any which are made b
the miraculous Madonnas of Italy. The image of the deceased school-
º: is from time to time observed to shake its head in disapproval,
and to knit its eyebrows and frown with awful severity. These
extraordinary phenomena first appeared the other morning, when a
revolutionary leading article came out in the Daily News, suggesting
the abolition of flogging in public schools. The marble heart of any
i. of the old school would of course be violently moved at the
idea of being deprived of that gratification which it derives from the
exercise of the rod. To indemnify old scholastic gentlemen for the
loss of the delight which some of them seem to take in whipping
children, they might be permitted to officiate as assistant executioners;
to do the flogging in the prisons: and in order to provide them with
sufficient work, a law should be made punishing the maltreatment of
women with flagellation. There may be some doubt whether the whip
is a proper instrument wherewith to teach tender youth humane letters,
but it is unquestionably one very suitable for unteaching a ruffian his
inhuman cruelty.
THE AWAKENED CONSCIENCE.
MR. BROTHERTON has, we are happy to see, been doing his duty
lately, and endeavouring to bring the preposterous sittings of the
House to an earlier close than usual. He has divided the Commons
several times after midnight on the question of adjournment, and
though he has not generally carried his motion, he has so far broken in
upon the proceedings of the night, that the rest has been fragmentary,
and the adjournment has been hastened. We had been inclined to
reprove, if not to rebuke our BROTHERTON, for the facility with which
he had been yielding to the oppression of the Government behind which
he sits. That shake of the hat at the Speaker, and that deprecating
half-smile, which said that it was really too bad to go on at that hour,
were all very well, but when MR. FITzRoy turned round with a good
natured fierceness, and motioned MR. BROTHERTON to sit down, or
MR. GLADSTONE looked up with wild amazement, and obviously said,
“My goodness, here’s a man wanting to go to bed!” MR. BRO-
THERTON had no business to be quelled, and to resume his seat. He
should remember that his legislative mission is to send the other
members home to their amiable wives; and if he allows himself to be
put down, the ladies have no helper left. The man who would refuse
to drive members into the lobby to relieve virtuous females in solitude
and distress is unworthy the name of a BROTHERTON.
The MUSCOWITE ROMANCER.,
ONE would think that the Russian journal, the Invalide Russe, was
so called by reason of its statements being continually invalidated.
THE MoDERN PARNAssus.-Since the promotion of the originator
of the Penny Postage, St. Martin's-le-Grand may be called the English
Parnassus, for is it not the abode now of England's HILL of Letters?

PUNCH'S HANDBOOKS TO THE CRYSTAL
PALACE.
pete with the high autho-
rities who are entitled to
carry half the alphabet at
the end of their names,
and who are men of letters
by virtue of a long row of
consonants as well as by
other attributes, we pur-
pose furnishing a series
of hand-and-glove books
to the Crystal Palace.
Without any further
º: we shall at once
, dash up the stairs of the
Refreshment Room, leave
the Paris Chocolate Com:
pany on our right, thread
the mazes of marble
tables, and darting through
the Screen of the Kings
and Queens of England,
we shall find ourselves in
THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL HISTORY.
This forms naturally enough the first object of our investigation; and
re to treat of Ethnology—a word “which every schoolboy ||
we pre
knows,” but which nevertheless everybody thinks it necessary to te
everybody else is derived from two Greek words, and signifies the
science of races. Some people would interpret the “Science of
Races” as “the art of winning the Ascot Cup” or “Making a Book
for the Derby.” Almost every word ending in “logy,” is a scientific
word; and perhaps the many disputes arising out of the various
“logies” may have given rise to the term “loggerheads,” a state at
which the learned are apt to arrive in the course of those bickerings
which a love of truth and a dislike to each other will sometimes
generate. - - - -
Ethnology means the science not of races in general; for if it did, it
would be peculiar, rather to the Turf than to our common clay; but
it is the science of the human race in particular.
In the Crystal Palace it has not been thought necessary to make a
collection of the specimens of European objects, for there will always
be found among the visitors themselves a collection of living curiosities
ITHouT intending to com- chimneys.
of the various ºl. of Europe. Of these a moving cosmorama will
be constantly kept up, and a little comparative anatomy may be quietly
studied, by reviewing the bearded fop side by side with the Chimpanzee
in his primitive jº. Several of the specimens of Ethnology in
the Crystal Palace are to be found within the Arctic Circle, though
there are some equally extraordinary objects within our own circle, if
we are disposed to study them.
In the general arrangement of the department of Natural History,
an attempt has been made to group together the botany and zoology of
each locality, a plan which may be familiarly illustrated by placing
under a glass shade, a costermonger, a donkey, and a thistle. this
interesting group we should have ethnology represented by the man,
zoology would rear its head in the donkey, and botany would present
some of its finest points in the thistle. -
Among the foremost objects is a group of East Indians belonging to
India. Proper, and (judging from their costume, which is not so
moustache movement has taken among them, for they seem to wear
on the upper lip an arrangement
similar to that of the Ramoneur with
which modern civilisation sweeps her
We now turn to Borneo, but we
are not sorry to turn away again from
a tribe whose fashions are not by any
means of an engaging character. The
favourite dress seems to be nothing but
a head-dress, which consists generally
of a bandeau of human teeth, and some.
times a hat, similar in shape to those
worn, by very young ladies at the sea-
side, but trimmed with such strings of
molars and incisors as to suggest the
idea that the parties must be proud of
their extraction from the heads of
families., The Dyaks of Borneo are
said to be #3 into one hundred
various tribes, but it cannot be said
that “ variety is charming ” in the
case of any one of them. They are fond of accumulating skulls,
which they hand, down from father to son; but as these heads are
collected by hundreds, it is difficult to say under what particular
head we should class this strange pro-
pensity. To such an extent is it
carried, that a youth, cannot ma
till he has presented his bride wit
somebody else's skull; and unless he
has cut off another person’s head, he
is not allowed to become the head of
a family.
Qne of the most ordinary weapons
of the people of Borneo is a blow-
pipe, which is capable of inflicting
a fearful blow, and by means of
poisoned arrows establishing a rather
nº wound with remarkable nicety.
e next arrive at New Guinea, a
name of which nobody knows the
origin, and we may therefore hazard
the conjecture that the people of
New Guinea are always seeking for
change, and calling for a new Sove-
reign. Their fashions are easily de-
scribed, for their costume consists
of hair dressed a la Thillon, with a
necklace of fur, and a waistband of
matting. . The ladies of New Guinea carry, the decolleté principle
even further than our own, who seem nevertheless to have borrowed
the practice of wearing nothing on their necks, from some of the tribes
we have been noticing. The arrangement of the hair is one of the chief
º: of life, a point in which some of our drawing-room belles
resemble the barbarian coquettes of the Archipelago. The “double
skirt” has its origin in the double petticoat of leaves worn round the
waist by the women of New Guinea, who dye their hair with ochre, and
perform other tricks which are not uncommon among the fairer portion
of our highly civilised metropolis.
We must not pass coldly over the Arctic Regions, of which the Great
Bear seems to be the star. This animal, or rather his skin, was brought
home by. CAPTAIN INGLEFIELD, who, it is believed, embraced the
§§ when the Bear was preparing to embrace the gallant
aptain himself. Among the North American Indians we recognise an
shockingly scanty as it probably is in India Im-proper), the epithet article in trowsers, which would certainly be labelled as “the fashion”
“proper,” is not altogether unmerited. The complexion of some of in any cheap clothing mart of the present day: the trowsers are of the
these Indians is as black as Indian ink. Nearly every face has the brºadest stripe, and are worn by a Red Indian, who is obliging some
same stamp, and the process of stamping seems to have been carried of his friends in blue whiskers and yellow eyebrows with an accompani-
gut with considerable violence, causing the countenances to become so
flat that no one could call them handsome without being disposed to
flatter. In India there is a system of caste, which means that the son
walks in his father's shoes—if the father happens to have any. If
the father is a blacksmith the son is a blacksmith, and indeed all the
SMITHs are of necessity black, except perhaps a few of the Browns
for brunette is one of the colours that the hand of Nature has rubbed
into the faces of the East Indians. -
The Malays are given to the habit of tattooing, and they sometimes
proceed to such rivalry in the art that one will do his utmost to beat
the tattoo upon the other. -
Among the incidentals of the Malays may be noticed certain dental
operations, such as dyeing the teeth, and filing them down to the gums,
for few can wait patiently till they are sufficiently old files themselves
for their teeth to wear down to the desired level.
Leaving the East Indians we will now take a glance at the people
of Sumatra, who are chiefly remarkable for the form which the
ment to a war dance in which they are engaged.
...Passing, a few cases of birds, most of them remarkable for their
bills, which have been presented to the directors of the Crystal Palace,
and accepted without hesitation, we arrive at a party of South Americans
engaged in a fierce encounter with sticks. It is the ugly custom of
these very ugly customers to introduce a block of wood into the under
lip, and thus to illustrate their faces with a woodcut of the rudest
character. Their object is to tear out the illustrations and destroy the
blocks, which are set in these very low types of humanity.
Among another group of South Americans may be perceived a rather
gentlemanly looking person in the completest, and probably the
cheapest suit of stripes that ever came under our notice. The material
is nothing but blue paint, so that the entire costume could have cost
little more than the labour employed in fitting on what may be termed
an entire suit of Nature's blouses. The objects in this department are so
numerous that it is impossible to £º them more than a passing glance;
so congratulating the bonnet-monkey on the opportunity afforded him

by the ladies of the present day, to bring the bonnet into contempt,
and with a nod of recognition to the Ounce, a creature which has
become so rare, that many when told of its existence will not believe
the am-ounce-ment, we take our leave of the Natural History Collection
of the Crystal Palace.
CHARACTERISTICS OF IRISH MEMBERS.
THE Select Committee º: by Mr. Punch to investigate the
character of Irish Members, have presented him with their report on
that interesting subject, which is as follows:–
Your Committee are of opinion that the Irish Members of Parliament
considered as a body, constitute the most important and influential
section of the House of Commons, not by reason of the weight they are
able to throw into the scale of nearly balanced º: but on account
of the great moral effect of their support, when afforded either to
measures or men.
It appears to your Committee that pure and disinterested patriotism
is the primary and leading characteristic of the representatives of
Ireland. They are j, remarkable for a lofty superiority to
motives of ambition and personal †. and their indiffe-
rence to personal objects prevents, them from ever exhibiting those
mean, jealousies whereof the degrading spectacle is so often presented
by other parties.
The quality for which, in the next place, your Committee consider
the Irish element in the House of Čommons to be conspicuous is an
aptitude for practical legislation, and this, together with the amenity
and good temper which they are almost as eminent for, occasions their
presence in the House to be a great furtherance to its business, where-
unto they never offer vexatious obstructions, and which they never
interrupt by frivolous and unnecessary disputes.
The utilitarian spirit, however, by which the Irish members are
animated is combined, according to the sentiments of your Committee
with broad and liberal views, which are enunciated with a wonderful
correctness of logic at once fluent and concise.
Lastly, your Committee take leave to notice, as a consideration of
importance in the constitution of an assembly on which depends the
maintenance of our civil and religious liberties, the striking solicitude
manifested by the majority of the Irish members for the welfare and
prosperity of the Protestant institutions of the kingdom.
The only exception, that can be taken against the Irish members
your Committee conceive to be more than countervailed by the political
independence which they derive from the circumstance forming the
ground of it. It is that perhaps, altogether, they have rather too much
property.
THE WILD-OAT-SOWING MACHINE.
AN American genius, inspired by the Sewing-Machine, has invented
a wonderful apparatus to enable young men to sow their wild oats.
It is a most ingenious piece of mechanism, being equally adapted to
the pocket of the Government clerk'and the cheque-book of the million-
naire. It has been calculated that not only will there be a material
saying of time by this new process, but that also a much greater expen-
diture of money will be gained by it. It is so simple in its operation
that any young man who can write may play with it with the greatest
ease. An experiment was tried upon a wealthy minor, who all the
innocent ways of a child, and it was found that, long before he had
become of age, he had not only not a single wild oat left in his possessio
but that he had already reaped the consequences of all those he .
sown. The result is—and the inventor points to it with no little pride—
that the Young man has not as many pence now as he had thousands
before. The great merit of the invention lies decidedly in its simplicity.
It requires not the slightest practice, but is acquired j. nogreater study,
no greater outlay, than a few minutes' patience. Moreover, it is so ad-
mirably contrived that any one, who is in the least clever in operations
that require the free º of the hand, becomes perfect after one trial,
and is in a state to teach others. We will endeavour to describe thé
principal characteristics of this new “WILD-OAT-Sowing MACHINE.”
It is simply a hand machine. At one end of it are arranged a
number of slips of paper, and the usual facilities for writing. The slips
somewhat resemble in their shape the ordinary bill, or promissory note,
that is used in daily matters of commerce. As the operator affixes his
signature to the paper, he presses on a spring which forces down a stamp
that gives his slip a legal value. This stamp yaries from two shillings
up to thirty. As soon as this is done, the bill is snatched up by some
unseen H.; and commences a series of runs, which are hidden from
view. How it runs, and where it runs to, or how it has the power of
running at all, are so many mysteries that our ingenious inventor has
not thought fit to explain... It is only sufficient to state that after a
certain period of running, that is sometimes over in three months, and
sometimes extends to nine,—the operator is expected to be at the other
end of the machine to meet his little piece of paper. Should he fail,
however, in meeting it, to such perfection is the machinery of this ex-
traordinary instrument brought that the piece of paper will actually run
after him, no matter where he may be, and nothing but actual payment
in full will stop it. We must state that at the time of parting with the
autograph document, some money is handed over to the person who
has just been putting his signature to it. This sum is sometimes half
the amount specified in the paper, sometimes, only one quarter, and
sometimes nothing at all. It entirely depends upon the market to
which the young man takes his wild oats to sell. Sometimes he is
paid only in wine, beer, blacking, or boot-jacks. The machine is
extremely simple to look at, being put in motion generally by a screw,
that works it and keeps it running. This screw is regulated by one or
two Jews, who are always too happy to explain the principle (or, at
least, what little there is, for it is mostly devoid of any principle what-
evº) of the action.,, . - - - -
We º the following very flattering testimonial of the admirable
efficacy of this new machine:—
“Sin,-I first became acquainted with the secret of your wonderful Wild-Oat-
Sowing Machine whilst on a visit to FLEECE's, in Roulette Street, Liecester Square.
I instantly tried it. Nothing could have been so efficacious. By working it two or
three times, I was enabled to visit the different places of amusement about town. I
next tried the betting shops. This was not sufficient, and I made a trial of the gam-
bling and cigar shops about St. James's Street. I went to Baden-Baden—kept racers—
lent my money indiscriminately to all my friends—published several books of poems—
took a theatre—in short, committed every imaginable folly that a young man can be
guilty of. The consequence is that, thanks to your excellent contrivance, which always
put money at my command as often and oftener than I wanted it, I am now in the
Bench, having spent a small fortune of £12,000 a year in less than nineteen months.
I also owe £500 to my fishmonger, and a few hundreds to my washerwoman, and can
safely lay my hand upon my pocket, and say I haven't a farthing in the world; but at
the same time I can boldly affirm I haven't a Wild Oat left, having effectually sown
every one of them. If it hadn't been for your admirable “Sowing Machine,' I doubt
if I could have done this.
“(Signed)
Other testimonials may be had, on application at the Insolvent Court,
and the “Wild-Oat-Sowing Machine” be seen any day in
ALFREd KEIGHTE FLEIGHER.”

CITY OF LONDON CEMENT.
NEw species of cement,
which it is hoped may
prove durable, has been
discovered in the City
of London. We are at
liberty to mention its
principal ingredients,
which are derived from
both the animal and
vegetablekingdoms, and
from, in short, the well-
known, materials of the
civic banquets. That
turtle is of a glutinous
nature is generally un-
derstood; and in com-
mon parlance it is said
to stick to the ribs :
whence it will be readily
inferred that the new
cement contains a considerable proportion of that delicious reptile.
The cement, however, is not adapted for ordinary build urposes,
although it may be used, largely in freemasonry; nor is it of the nature
of marine glue, notwithstanding that it will be offered to the two
principal marine powers. It will be prepared by the LORD, MAYOR
and Aldermen for the purpose of securing and consolidating the union
between this country º: with which view it will be employed
in lining the interior of certain distinguished French citizens, to be
invited to a grand national entertainment of which it will form the
staple. This cement for joining France and England might be ve
much improved if Government would allow the addition to it of Fren
wines admitted at a reduced duty.
The Czar's Creditor.
THE º: say that NICHOLAs is trying to raise a loam of seven
millions on the Amsterdam Bourse. ...That sum will not suffice to get
him out of his difficulties. Even if it should enable him to liquidate
the expenses of his war, there will still be the devil to pay.
THE HEIGHT OF TOTAL ABSTINENCE.
THE Teetotallers want to exclude the bottle from the Crystal Palace.
We wonder they don't carry their fanaticism so far as to endeavour to
deprive it of the glass.

THE MORAL OF WOODEN CANNON-BALLS.
The humane governor of Sveaborg—that man ought to be enrolled
as one of the Vice-Presidents qf the Peace Society—has been
imprisoned for life by the inclemency of the wicked Czar, and only for
having substituted wooden balls for iron cannon balls, putting in fact
the cost of the real shot in his pocket, and painting the fictitious shot
very black, that they might, to the vulgar, unsophisticated eye, pass for
mortal missiles. e say again that this man ought to meet with some
expression of sympathy from the peace-mongers. What, now, if
MEssRs. STURGE and PEASE should—in memory of their late visit to
St. Petersburg—solicit of the EMPEROR pººl. to convey to
Siberia a pigeon-pie, to the captive governor P A simple pigeon-pie, in
testimony and symbolical of his practical peacefulness that turned the
adamantheart of mortal shot to painted touchwood? Why should not
the * of cotton-balls make some testimony to peaceful balls of
Woo
In some way, however, our own Premier has acknowledged the
wisdom of the unfortunate governor of Sveaborg—but with much
better luck. MR. LAYARD considers the stores of the EARL of
ABERDEEN; and exclaims “wooden cannon-balls!” More : con-
vinced of the woodenness of our governor and º Premier, MR.
LAYARD gives notice of impeachment, declaring self ready and able
to prove their naked, ligneous substance. -
§: is the resource of the EARL OF ABERDEEN ? Why, he takes a
hint from the hapless governor of Sveaborg, and immediately sets about
painting his wooden shot. Not, indeed, merely painting, but deeply
dyeing the missiles, to prove himself in warlike earnestness against
Nicholas the arch-destroyer. “Wooden cannon-balls, you call 'em!”
cries the Premier. And thereupon, he rummages up his very famous
letter to Count NESSELRoDE on the Treaty of Adrianople, and with
the black, mortal ink in which that tremendous missive was written,
he dyes and stains his wooden shot and—to the critical eye and acute
judgment of a most .# and sagacious public—ABERDEEN's
wooden cannon-shot, painted with ink of five-and-twenty years ago—

against them as you may, shall still return an iron sound. Never did ||
ink so well disguise falsehood with an outside of truth. - -
But these Sveaborg timber-shot are evidently destined to beget inspi-
rations. MR. MILNER GIBSON is doubtless touched by wood, and gives
utterance accordingly. Manchester with a heart—bleeding like any
cotton-pod—begs to know why the pitch and tar of Uleaborg should be
ruthlessly destroyed. There is property—sacred property (and still the
sympathetic cotton weeps gouts of *. !) to the amount of £400,000
given to the devouring element! MR. MILNER GIBsoN–still thinking
of the wooden shot—strikes his forehead, and of SIR JAMEs GRAHAM
demands an explanation -
SIR JAMEs, with some remembrance—foolishly, weakly piteous,
perhaps—of the red-hot iron, poured into the stranded Tiger—asks,
what particular indulgence should be shown to the enemy we have to
deal with ?”
(MR, MINER,Gmson exclaims confidentially to his waistcoat—
“Four hundred thousand pounds of property l’’)
SIR JAMEs—untouched by the sacredness of the appeal—ruthlessly
continues:
“We had it in our power to destroy the city of Odessa, and we spared it. We
attacked the batteries of Odessa only, for which we were subjected to something like
censure, and I must confess that I begin to partake of that feeling myself. (Cheers.)
How did the enemy act towards a British ship which accidentally ran ashore in a fog
near this very port of Odessa? An immense multitude of soldiers, with batteries and
red-hot shot, were brought down, and the stranded vessel was fired upon. I cannot see
that any peculiar forbearance is necessary towards this enemy. (Great cheering).”
MR. MILNER GIBsoN could not, and did not, deny all this; never-
theless he thought with sympathetic admiration of the clemency, the
philanthropy of the Governor of Sveaborg who, for his own ends,
substituted timber for iron. And the sympathy of the peacemongers,
even in his captivity, must comfort the Governor of Sveaborg, who
cannot want . for wooden balls, so long as the heads and, we
may add, the hearts of such men of peace be with him.

IMPORTANT FROM THE SEAT OF WAR I
LETTERS FROM THE EAST BY OUR OWN BASEII-BOZOUK.
“On board H.T.M.'s Ship the Mahmoudjee Kebobjee, off Sebastopol,
“July 5th, 1854.
= MY DEAR SIR,
- “I RETURNED to the
Hôtel d’Angleterre, immersed in
disagreeable thought, for it is
never pleasant to look on friends
for the last time, more especially
if you are going away from a plea-
sant place on a confoundedly
disagreeable journey, as a trip in
a chain-gang to Siberia un-
doubtedly is, most especially of
all, if you are about to part #.
a being so beautiful, beloved, and
devoted as I then thought
MATILDA SchoUzoFF. Beautiful!
Yes! devoted 2 phoo! beloved P
ha, ha!—But I am advancing
matters.
“We had our usual company
to supper, excepting of course
TUFFSKIN, who, for very good
reasons, did not show, and drank
many a friendly bumper to our
Quaker friends, whose last night
it was, and whose luggage lay
piled in the Hotel corridors, ready
to be carried off to the steamer
before dawn. , Young Dobkins
was particularly melancholy. He
has beautiful blue eyes, and a
figure and an expression, as I
have previously stated, singularly
like my own. The young fellow’s
eyes, I remarked, began to fill
with tears, and he spoke with profound emotion of the kindness which
he had received from inhabitants of St. Petersburg, contrasting the
splendour and elegance of the society there, with the humdrum routine
of Godmanchester, Bristol, and other cities whither his lot had led
him, as a Quaker, a manufacturer, and a man.
“I know the world pretty well, and when a young fellow begins to
blush, and shake, and sigh, and tremble in his voice, and hang down
his head, and rub his eyes with his fist, I feel tolerably certain what is
the matter. “Hullo, my friend BROADBRIM, says I, ‘there’s a woman
in the case isee that in a jiffey.’
“BRQADBRIM gave a heave of his chest, a squeeze to my hand, and
demurely pleaded guilty to the soft impeachment; a woman,there was,
as beautiful! oh, as be-eu-eu-ti-ful as an angel, he gurgled out, con.
gealing his emotion and a part of his comely young countenance (con-
found it!) in a frothing beaker of champagne—a woman, the loveliest
being in St. Petersburg, from whom he did not know how he should
tear himself away.
“The loveliest being in St. Petersburg! thought I; no, no, my fine
lad, that young person is disposed of elsewhere,” naturally presumin
that the young fellow had lost his heart to, some girl of the English
factory, some hide and tallow merchant's, daughter, in his own shop-
keeping, slop-selling, square-toed walk of life.
“I have a feeling heart, and having been touched by love and frantic
with passion, many many scores of times in my life, can feel another's
woe under those painful and delicate circumstances. I consoled honest
Dobkins, therefore; I clapped him on the back; returned squeeze for
squeeze of his hand, and j his lady love in innumerable bumpers
of cham e, for which—poor satisfaction—I now console myself by
thinking that the young rascal was left to pay.
“As we were talking, Dobkins's servant brought him a note, which
he seized eagerly, read with glittering eyes and flushing cheeks, over
which he murmured a hundred gasps and exclamations, and was about
to kiss, had not my presence deterred him.
“‘Kiss away, my boy,” said I; ‘I have osculated reams of note
paper in my time, and know full well whom that pretty little packet
comes from.”
; : Do thee?’ says he, blushing up to the temples.
“‘Of course I do,” I answered with a laugh. Dost thou think, O
bashful BRoadBRIM that the " —— I protest I had here very nearly
written down my name and title—‘that WERAx has never been in love
with a pretty girl.” - -
. “‘Chief,” says he-for Chief I am, though my tribe is well nigh ex-
tinct, and my Chieftainship a mockery—‘Chief,” says he, “dost thee
know that this letter concerns thee; a great danger menaces thee—
exile, chains; and in a low whisper, so that the waiter should not hear,
who was cutting the string of the sixth bottle—‘Siberia /*
“‘Does the whole town know it?’ cried I, ‘double-distilled donkey
that I was—is my disgrace the talk even of the hemp and tallow
merchants of the city?” .
“‘My letter,’ says DoRKINs, slowly, and with much agitation—the
artful young hypocrite, I should like to wring his neck—'my letter is
from one who is a very good friend to thee, who fears the dreadfulfate
that awaits thee in the eternal snow'—the canting young humbug—
‘who points out the only way to avert thy evil fortune—the way to
freedom, the way to escape from thy tyrant, perhaps to revenge thyself
on him at some future day.”
“‘Ha! boy,' I exclaimed, strongly moved by the young crocodile's
words, for as I never told falsehood myself I am slow to suspect it
in another; ‘so thou knowest the fate that menaces me, and hast found
out means to avert it; speak, my friend; whatever a man of courage
may do I am ready to attempt, in order to escape from a tyrant, and
One dy to avenge my wrong.’
“‘Easy, my good friend ſº cries this young squaretoes, this arch sly-
boots, “we Quakers are of the peaceful sort; here is no question about
revenge, but about escape, and that immediately. Thee knowest that the
f. of Petersburg are shut against thee, and that thee may as well
ope to escape from the Autocrat as from death, when the day comes.
A way, however, there is, and but one, by which thee can put thyself
out of reach of the claws of this Russian Eagle; and though I shall
risk myself not a little, nevertheless for thy, sake, and for the sake of
those who are interested in thy welfare, I will abide the peril, so I may
set thee free. Our steamer, the John Bright, sails from the Potemkin

“The young villain rushed up into his room, and put on my uniform,
which fitted him to a nicety, and I painte a pair of moustaches
with one of the burnt champagne corks, of which a half-dozen were
lying on the table: you would really have thought it was myself as you
looked at him. Ah! Fatal resemblance Ah! Sorrow that throws
its bleak shade alike o'er my life and my woes!

the Peace Deputation were aware that I, and not their young companion,

crumbling battlements of Cronstadt, and hurl into mid air the ships and
arsenals of Sebastopol. Ifear other counsels than mine may be followed.
“St. ARNAUD and I had a dispute long ago, when he was in a very
different situation in life. With the English commanders I cannot com-
municate, owing to my peculiar position, and the Ballingarry affair.
It was that unlucky business likewise which prevented my friend, the
EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH, from giving me a command over troops
which were to act in conjunction with the forces of the English QUEEN.
He offered me Algeria, but I preferred active service against Romanoff,
and the Colonel of Bashi-Bozouks has already put a shot or two into
the proud wings of the Russian Eagle.
“If anything was wanting to sharpen the edge of my hatred against
him, against Russia, against men and women, against Quakers espe-
cially, it was a paragraph which my kind friend, the EMPERQR
NAPoleoN, showed to me one afternoon, as we were sitting in the
Pavillon Marsan, talking over Russia and the war. I was translating
for him—and I think I have said that I * the language perfectly
—some of the lying bulletins out of the Petersburg gazettes, in
which his Majesty and his British allies are abused in a most vulgar
manner, when glancing down a column of fashionable intelligence, I
came to the following paragraph:—
“‘CoxvrBs1ox of AN ENGLISH. QUAKER to THE ORTHodox FAITH.—A young
Quaker nobleman, of the highest birth, whose family has devoted itself for some time
past to commercial pursuits, whereby he has realised an immense fortune, has quitted
the lamentable errors and benighted faith under which most of his countrymen labour,
and has professed himself a convert to the only true and orthodox religion. It is
M. Dobkinski's intention to establish himself in our capital, and his Majesty has
iously awarded him the order of St. Andrew of the second class, the rank of
5. and the permission to marry MATILDA, daughter of Police President Pance
Schouzoff."
“‘MICK, my goodfellow, said his Majesty, the EMPEROR NApoleon,
‘you look alittle pale:” and no wonder; I did look a little pale, though I
did not inform my Imperial interlocutor of the causes of my disquiet,
but you and the public now may understand in part, for my adventures
are not nearly over, why it is that I am a “BASHI-Bozouk.”
THE RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN IN DIFFICULTIES.

Wherewithal to enjoy my amusement of killing,
My loan over º is utterly scouted,
And my ports are blockaded, and forces are routed,
And it seems very likely that I shall be knouted.

I can borrow, to pay for ball, powder, and rifle;’
Very soon I shall have not a shot in the locker,
And the duns are beginning to bang at my knocker,
So I soon must be done up, according to Cocker.
Fast back from the Pruth mythrashed Cossacks are prancing,
I'm obliged to retreat, none the needful advancing,
And nation against me is banding with nation,
And I see nought before me but initiºn,
Because I cannot obtain accommodation.
SYMPATHY.—Sorrow, shared by two persons, becomes much lighter
—like a PALMER's candle with two wicks.
oLD CAMBRIDGE owls.
THE University Intelligence of the Times mentions a learned question
as having been propounded, but not answered, at the Cambridge
Archæological Society, à-propos of an antiquarian paper concerning
rebuses;” whence we learn that the sages constituting that erudite
|body are not fully informed de rebus omnibus, whatever amount of
|knowledge they may possess concerning quibusdam aliis. We read
that
“At the close of this paper, Mr. WestMacott asked if any one could explain the
meaning of a small gold frog attached to the left ear of a statue of one of the ancient
family of the Polrys, in Suffolk. Professor Henslow said, in that part of the
country young frogs were called ‘polley-wiggles,' and so it might have reference to
the name, but no one could throw any light on this fact.”
Much PROFEssoR HENslow and the Cambridge antiquaries must
know about archaeology, or etymology either | Polley-wiggle is a
i. of porwigle, which means, according to DR. Johnson, a
tad ole or young frog, not yet fully shaped. That is to say, a por-
wigle or polley-wiggle is, an undeveloped or undergraduate frog, a
|batrachian not yet arrived at the dignity of a little frog. How the
leadenest pump in any learned assembly could have boggled at a riddle
so very plain as the connexion of the frog with the “ancient family of
the Polleys” must pass all common understanding. It is almost an
insult to the intelligent, may to the ordinarily stupid reader, to say
more; but as some of the Cambridge DRYASDusts may happen to
stumble on these lines, the liberty may perhaps be pardoned of an
allusion to the well-known song—
“A frog he would a-wooing go,”
together with its burden of world-wide celebrity:-
“Roley Poley, gammon and spinach,
Heighol says ANToxy Rowley.”
Here is the very name of Poley, with relation to the frog, pure
and simple, without being modified and mollified into Polley; and
|although in juxtaposition with gammon and spinach, a great deal more
remote from those symbols of fallacy than that diminutive. The statue
of the old Poley, perhaps, was that of the original Roley Poley, and
the little gold frog attached to its left ear was clearly intended for that
precocious reptile who was determined to seek a conjugal partner—
“Whether his mother would let him or no,”
in defiance of maternal authority: and here the question naturally
arises whether the circumstance that the Archaeologists of Cambridge
are out—and how far they are out—is sufficiently well known to their
Alma Mater.
PAWS OFF MY HAT.
“The Hon. Member (MR. Apsley PELLATT), whose gesticulation is unique, hap-
pened to be standing immediately behind MR. Locke King, and, during the physical
enforcement of the voluntary principle, he continued to dash his fists into the crown of
that Hon. Member's hat, and otherwise spread such terror around, that a large space
of the bench below him was deserted, CAPTAIN Scobell, a naval hero, covering the
retreat.”—Morning Herald's Report of the Debate, June 21st.
MR. APSLEY PEL-LATT, MR. APSLEY PEL-LATT,
You must show more regard for a gentleman's hat;
You may pitch into Bishops, Priests, Church, and all that,
But you’ve no right to batter another man's hat.
Yourgestures may be to the purpose most pat,
But the pat should not fall on agentleman's hat.
Thrust your hands in your pockets, or keep them quite flat,
And then you won’t damage another man's hat.
If you do it again, you may get tit for tat;
So keep your paws off, MR. Apsley PEL-LATT.
LIMITED LIABILITY.
Messrs. BRIEFLEss and DUNUP are in favour of a bill for the above
º urpose. They state that they should like the liability to
be as limited as possible; in fact, if the liability could, in all cases, be
limited to, nothing, they should like it all the better. Some such
measure, they are of opinion, is urgently necessary, as it would have
the effect, not only of removing many of the fetters that at present
shackle commercial enterprise, but also of bringing the purchaser and
the vendor in a closer and more friendly relationship together. More:
over, they modestly represent that it, would relieve them of a deal of
trouble and painful annoyance, as nothing can be more distressing to
their feelings, or at times more embarrassing, than to have to send away
claims which, however just the liability of them may be, they find they
have it not in their power, from a total inadequacy of means, satis-
factorily to discharge. They conclude by declaring that they are
decidedly in favour of a thorough new system of debt without any
|liability at all.

LUM LEY'S M I D NIGHT REVIEW.
(To the air of NAPOLEON's ditto.)
At midnight’s dreary hour is heard an awful sound
From the empty Opera orchestra, through the cobwebb'd boxes round:
A Ghost-Band tunes with fleshless hands shades of fiddles pass'd away,
And the spectre conductor's “rat-a-tat'’ bids the overture to play:
Oh strange the thrill that from empty stalls to lone parterre there
comes;–
It stirs, it wakes the dead artistes from their posthumous dressing-
rooms :
Lo! Prime Donne that charmed the ears of our fathers long ago—
GRASSINI, PASTA, MALIBRAN–through the coulisses stageward flow,
Bassi profondi, who won applause at GEORGE THE Fourth’s fat hands;
Tenori, whose descendants . on CHAMBERs's estate demands:
Flooding the vacant Opera-house their phantom voices go,
As the ghost-conductor waves his airy baton to and fro;
And the spectre-band around him the signal beat obeys, -
And * salle is peopled with ghosts full-dressed in fashions of other
ays.
AMENITIES OF CLONMEL GAOL.
In reference to the brutal Irish rascal, who º the other day,
the savage outrage of.dragging away a young lady—possessed of
property—from her family, and against her inclination, by the help of a.
gang of ruffians, but who was defeated, well thrashed, and lodged in
Clonmel gaol, the Tipperary Free Press sympathetically says:–
“Under the direction of the local inspector, the Rev. JAMEs Morrow, every care has
been taken to provide for the comfort of the unfortunate gentleman. He is iocated in
the room occupied by Mr. SMITH O'BRIEN, when a State prisoner in Clonmel, in the
immediate vicinity of the hospital, where he will receive every attention that his con-
dition, requires. His portmanteau, being first opened in the presence of the governor,
was directed to be given him, and MR. Srbahan, it is known, will do all in his power
towards rendering his confinement as little irksome as possible, pending an application
for bail, to the Court of Queen's Bench.”
What a comfortable prison that of Clonmel must be. How much
Sooner would one be sent there than anywhere else, if one were a thief.
If such consideration as that above described is extended to a prisoner
committed for stealing a lady, how much indulgence must be shown to
one incarcerated for stealing a horse —particularly if having got
kicked in the attempt. Wouldn’t he receive “every attention that his
condition required P’ Would not “every care be taken to provide for
the comfort of the unfortunate gentleman | * Wouldn't MR. STRAHAN
“do all § hi. power towards rendering his confinement as little irksome
as possible !”
orcible abduction would seem as popular in Tipperary as highway
robbery accompanied by violence was in Middlesex a century ago, and
it must, indeed be considered to exceed the exploits of TuRPIN in
turpitude.
Sold for a Song.
Though MR. LIDDELL would not allow his Curates to sing the
Church Service, he has not been able to prevent them from lecturing
him to a very pretty tune. After what has occurred, it is probable
that if there is any chanting at St. Paul's, Knightsbridge, the Incum-
bent himself will sing very small.
Inshort book-muslim shrouds the bony coryphées appear,
And fleshless hands in ghosts of gloves ghosts of lorgnons uprear;
And at the midnight hour, MR.LUMLEY, the Ex-Lessee,
Comes slow and sad into his box, by aid of his master-key;
Gravely he sits him down, and the curtain draws aside,
And gazes on the phantom resurrection of his pride;
The empty space illuming blue the ghostly gas-light falls
As the Ex-Lessee sweeps round the house from pit to gallery stalls!
He sees it graced by duke and lord—his old patrons still are true:
JENNY LIND crushes crowd again upon his tranced view.
Singers and dancers round him for engagements eager draw,
And to journalists and scene shifters once more his word is law;
And two magic words he murmurs—that in £s, d. combine– .
“LIND” º: watchword—and again, “WAGNER” the counter-sign
Thus at midnight in the Opera House, an opera house no more,
Wanders an Ex-Lessee, who finds law and life a bore
LORD PALMERSTON'S PARTIES.
It has been the fashion of late years to say that the old distinctions
of party have disappeared; and to wonder how the QUEEN’s government
could be carried on without a Ministry professing one set of principles,
andan Qpposition maintaining another. Political antagonism is, hºwever,
founded in nature, and LoRD PALMERSTON has found a new denomi-
nation for the rival sects, on either side, which, under some name or
another, must always exist. The noble Lord, in the debate on the
Board of Health grant, is reported to have said:-
“Now, in every town there were two parties, well known by two designations cor-
responding to Whig and Tory, and dividing the town almost as completely. One was
the “clean' party, and the other the 'dirty' party. (Laughter.) Each was a well
known faction, and neither felt any diffidence in expressing its views. A man would
say, ‘I am the dirty party; I like dirt, and I don't choose to pay for being clean.'
(A laugh.)”
PALMERSTON is right; and political, as well as evening parties, will
go on just as before, under new titles only, with a corresponding modi-
fication of watchwords, cries, and cant. The motto of one side will be
Soap and Water, and that of the other Slush. The clean party will
shout Pearlash for Ever! and their dirty adversaries will, exclaim, No
Soda! By the former, the principles of the laundress will be advocated,
whilst the latter will denounce these as ablutionary doctrines. Oxygen
will be the demand of the friends of cleanliness; sulphuretted hydrogen
the requisition of the disciples of dirt: and as the clean politicians will
march beneath the mop and scrubbing-brush, so the dirty will rally
round the cesspool and the cinder-heap.
The Foreign Office in Danger.
THE EARL of MALMESBURY has expressed his fear in the Lords
“lest some day the Foreign Office might come down and bury some
members of HER MAJESTY's Government in its ruins.”. We know not
what changes are in store for us; but should a certain Earl be in office
at the time, it will be all the worse for him; for assuredly nobody will
be in a hurry to dig him out.

HEARTSEASE FOR THE CZAR.
OUR Scotch friends are great growers of pansies, and
have just achieved some triumphant exhibitions. “Lord
Palmerston” has flowered remarkably well; being almost
all that a pansy ought to be. But “Omar Pasha” has
come out especially brilliant; carrying away the prize as
being “of excellent substance and colour, and good in
*Nº.
ow this Omar Pasha pansy affords an excellent oppor-
tunity for our floral friends of Caledonia to mark their
sense of the merits of Nicholas; marking it in a manner
that should carry a sweet and bitter moral with it. Let
them subscribe a halfpenny each, and have the Omar
Pasha flower nicely executed in gold and enamel, and send
it, to the EMPEROR OF Russia to wear, as a breast-pin.
The present should be accompanied with the few pithy
words—especially pithy since Kalafat and Oltenitza—of
SHAKSPEARE—“Omar Pasha pansy, That’s for thoughts.”
“Hide and Seek.”
MR. WILKIE Collins has just published a new novel,
called “Hide and Seek.” However, we merely allude to
it, as it reminds us that “Hide and Seek” happens to
be the game that at present is being played in the Baltic
and the Black Sea. With the Russians, it is “Hide; ”
with the French and English, it is “Seek.” But the game
must soon be played out, and then we hope that we shall
be found (and it only depends on our finding the Russians)
to be on the winning side.
Parliamentary Economy.
THE reason why the House of Commons has rejected
so many measures this Session, lies on the surface. Having
the expenses of the war to meet, it is unwilling to render
itself liable for any other bills.

IT HE road to Pompeii
lies ... beyond the
Arctic Regions—
of the Crystal Pa-
lace—if we enter
from the south,
and is not very far
from Birmingham
and Sheffield, if
we happen to be
coming from the
north.
Pompeii, was a
watering place—a
species of Margate
—for the Romans,
and, as well as
Herculaneum,was
situated at the
foot of Wesuvius.
Herculaneum be-
ing the nearer,
may be said to
- - -- - have occupied the
in-step, while Pompeii, situated at a more distant point, may be con-
sidered to have stood on the mountain's great toe. It would not seem
creditable to the wisdom of the ancients to have built a watering place
immediately under such an extensive fireplace as Vesuvius; but #.
suspected an eruption, and even STRAbo, who knew the rocks were
igneous, fancied that the fire must be—what he in fact was—quite out.
d º: in the year 79, Herculaneum and Pompeii were both
estroyed.
We will not enter into the distressing details of this calamity; for
word-painting might fail as dismally as scene-painting, which, in the
opera of Masaniello, represents an eruption of a canvas Vesuvius,
casting up its imaginary º from a crater, consisting of a saucepan of
red-fire shaken by the hand of the property man, at the back of the
stage. The catastrophe, had its “own reporter” in the person of
PLINY THE YoUNGER, who, in true reporter-like fashion, gives a ve
circumstantial account of the death of his uncle, though at a safe
distance from the spot where it occurred. .
The excavations which have brought Pompeii to light were the result
of a thirst for water rather than a thirst for information, since it is to
the sinking of a well that we are indebted for the discovery of the
buried city. For some time the work was carried on by a French
º who literally played with the marbles that were exhumed, for
e had them pulverised for the purpose of making stucco-a process
for which he himself deserves to be smashed. At length, the workmen
ment R. a stop to further excavations, and, as might be expected from
the . Neapolitan Government, nothing was done for thirty years.
At length, however, the work was resumed; bit by bit, the city has
been laid open; industry has found its fruits in the shape of wal:
nuts, almonds, and chesnuts, which may be said to have rewarded
labour with its desert. Wine has been discovered, which having been
eighteen hundred years in bottle, presents nothing, but a fine. old
crust, and a loaf, with the baker's name on it, has been found in a
similar condition. Eggs have been met with, looking as if they had
been newly laid where they were found, and a play-bill of the §:
announcing the performances of the troop of AMPLIATUs—probably
the Cooke or BATTY of the period—has been traced on the walls,
which thus bear testimony to the excellence of the bill-sticking of the
first century. - --
One of the houses that have been discovered at Pompeii used to be
called the House of the Tragic Poet, which, owing probably to the
modern notion that poets never, occupy houses, but always live in
lodgings, is now called the Homeric House, and the tragic poet is thus
turned unceremoniously, out of House and Home...Our respect for
literature induces us still to call it the Home of the Poet, and the idea
is favoured by an inscription at the entrance of “Cave Canem,” or
happening to come on some perfect statues, the Neapolitan Govern-

ouse, but on closer investigation of these chests, they seem to have
been emblems of the emptiness of riches, for nothing has been found in
any one of them. SIR BULwer Lytton, in his “Last Days of
Pompeii,” has made an amiable effort to elevate the “tragic poet’” by
describing his house and its appurtenances in language that its size and
pretensions scarcely seem to deserve. He says, “on one side of the
atrium a small staircase admitted to the apartments for the slaves on
the second floor.” If for “slaves” we were to read “lodgers,” we
fear, we should be nearer the truth, for when we remember that the
landlord was a poet, “the slaves” dwindle down in our imagination
i. solitary “slavey,” or maid-of-all-work for the whole establish-
ment.
Let us now enter the Pompeian Court, where we are told we shall
find ourselves at once “with TACITUs and the two PLINys,” but on
looking round we see a bricklayer and two labourers, while instead of
having “the roar of the amphitheatre still in our ears,” we catch the
distinct clatter of the knives and forks of the refreshment-room. This
reminds us that the Pompeian Court at the Crystal Palace was ori-
inally intended for purposes of refreshment, and dinners were to have
een served in the best modern style under the ancient peri-style. The
house is supposed to be detached, forming what is called an insula or
island, and, with the poet’s house still in our eye, we can imagine that
his being frequently surrounded with hot water may have caused the
application of the term “island” to his place of residence. There are
no windows near the ground, but there is over the door a “grating”
through which “the poet” or any other lessee might have delivered
occasionally a º: reply to an over-importunate visitor.
The front part of the entrance is called the Westibulum or Westibule,
which is an evident derivation from the word Westis, and would seem to
show that visitors were in the habit of leaving their Wests, or cloaks in
the passage at a Pompeian as at a London residence. At the end of
the passage is a screened door, and the threshold is further #.
by the representation of a ferocious dog, copied from that which kept
guard at the house of the poet, who was anxious perhaps to show that
there was a dog who could get a piece out as well as his master, if
occasion should require, . Just within the Westibulum, or passage is the
Prothyrum or Ostium, which corresponds to the Hall in which a “party”
is sometimes asked to take a seat, while the servant goes on with a
message, leaving the “party” to make a clearance of the hats and
great coats, if his visit should have been a mere cloak for his dishonest
intentions.
We next enter the Atrium, a Court or Common Hall, which was
open to all visitors, but which is in the Pompeian Court of the Crystal
alace, rather too fº at the top, too #. at the doors, and too open
at the windows. ... The basin in the middle of the Atrium was called the
Impluvium, and its use was to collect the rain, which was admitted by
a hole at the top called the Compluvium. This ought to have been the
same size as the reservoir below, but as the artists did not require any
water, and wanted additional light, they sacrificed correctness to effect
by making the Compluvium so large, that the Impluvium or cistern
must be in a state of constant overflow.
We will now walk into the bed-rooms or Cubicula, of which there are
three in the Pompeian House, which was probably ted to the
residence of a “small genteel family,” for the width of the best bed-
room is only six feet, nine inches. An attempt is made to give an
*. of space by bright paintings on a black surface, an expedient
rather calculated to mislead the occupant, for if he ventured on an
extra stretch out on the strength of the paintings, he might be un-
pleasantly reminded of the strength of the brick walls. In the third
;
|: inum was generally used
bed-room is an interesting º of a poet and an actor, the former
...; with his legs crossed in the attitude of a tailor, as if he were a
mere literary botcher, who has probably been patching up for the actor
a very bad part. . The Ala, or wing, is a small apartment or recess
in which luxury might have fixed a butler's pantry, but where necessity
would probably have crammed a turn-up bed. #. Ala is said to have
been used for the transaction of business, but the smallness of the wing
would seem to have fitted it for none but flying visits.
Opposite the door of entrance we pass into the Tablinum which con-
tains the “family archives,” but as the “family archives” were often
as apocryphal in those days, as the “family plate” is in our own, the
sed as a drawing-room for the spoons, and
ther members of the family. * *
We here catch a glimpse of the Peristylum, in the centre of which
was a square garden; but not wishing to take a turn in the square we
shall at once enter the Triclinium, or dining-room, the walls of which
are adorned with pictures of figs of a º figure, and dates of the
period. The guests did not sit at table, but were accustomed to lie on
their breasts to help themselves—an awkward position in which they
must have occasionally looked as if they could not help themselves,
articularly if they happened to have imbibed too much wine at the
anquet. The ſº before dinner always took off their shoes, and it
would be as well if the practice were observed in some of our modern
clubs, where “gentlemen are *-often in vain—“requested not to put
their feet upon the sofas.” A Roman dinner of the first quality included
peacocks au naturel, and other delicacies, of which grasshoppers were
perhaps the lightest; but it is a curious fact that the course of soman
centuries has not made much alteration in the three courses whic
formed the usual meal of the ancients. The wine was rathersweet and
fruity, but much depended on its age;
the bottles were marked with the names
of the Consuls who were in office at the
time the wine was made. Thus the liquor
got the name of a person, and it was cus-
tomary to call for an amphora of Cesar,
or a sip of SCIPIo, as we in modern days
order our bottle of GoRDON's Sherry, or
CLIQUOT's Champagne. -
Before quitting the Pompeian Court,
we would direct attention to the paintings
on the walls, in which the ideas are not
nearly so bright as the colours. In one
place a yellow-haired VENUs is seen fish-
ing with such success as to have secured
a most respectable herring, and there are
several paintings in which CUPID is repre-
AMPHORAE
sented as on “sale or hire,” in various positions. We may with WITRU-
VIUS condemn the taste of making figures stalk out of the stems of
flowers, and placing, buildings on candelabra, as if a house could stand
on such a light foundation as a candlestick; but we cannot quit the
i. without making up our minds to call again, and again, at the
ompeian House of the Crystal Palace.

BAR, BAR BLACK SHEEP.
It is an old trick of barristers of a certain class to abuse
each other's clients and bully each other's witnesses, but
they have recently º to ..". and abuse each other
- in a style worthy of the worst º of the Old Bailey.
It is not likely that the public will call in question the

mutually formed; nor will any sensible person think of
asserting. that each barrister not deserved all the
vituperation that his learned brother has spit out upon
him. We must, however, protest against the outrage of
public decency, which has been committed in selectin
the occasion of an inquest on a deceased, child, for one o
these vulgar exhibitions of forensic squabbling. We cannot
be surprised at the impatience of the jury at a scene
which was becoming every moment more disreputable
between the members of the Bar, who really ought to
settle their differences through the medium of Bell’s Life
in London, rather than through the abuse of opportunities.

ANECDOTES OF PAINTING.
SIR. GoDFREY KNELLER (the anecdote has been hidden
from HoRAcE WALPoLE)—SIR GoDFREY was once upon a
time painting—the subject has escaped us–from a human
.. a humble villager.
“You knows the QUEEN ?” says CHAwBAcon to SIR
GoDFREY.
SIR GoDFREY bowed.
“There's nowt she won't do for you, eh?” .
SIR GoDFREY smiled and bowed again.
“Well, then, just have the kindness to ax HERMAJESTY-

A “ SUMMER, FLOWER ‘’
PLEAS.
MR. SERJEANT BYLEs, conducted a very delicate case last week; a
case very illustrative of the tenderness and . instinctively paid
by moral John Bull, to the immorality of noble lords. MR. BYLES
was for the fair defendant, whom—as MR. Epwin JAMEs averred—he
designated, “a summer flower.”, ChIEF JUSTICE: JERyIs did not
recollect whether Brother ByLEs had so designated the fair, wronged
one, but—having seen her in the witness-box—thought that, with
better justice, she might be called “ a full-blown flower.” And so, on
evidence, it appeared: a very full-blown flower; full-blown as any
Dahlia or DALILAH. -
We opine that counsel, resolved in such cases upon flowers, would
have a more pathetic effect .."#. were they to sing part of their
appeal. There is an admirable ditty for the occasion in the Reggars'
pera; and, considering the matter, it is to us an especial wonder that
CHARLEs PHILLIPs, who left the Bar with such an illustrious reputa-
tion for the care and cure of trampled flowers and broken hearts
never sang the lines; the more so, as it is well known he is endowe
with a deep, melodious voice. Let us suppose the action is for breach
of promise, or for a worse wrong. Imagine the effect of a SIMS REEVEs
%W. without a cold, and in gown and wig), trolling forth the lines
Ot UAY:-
IN THE COMMON
“Virgins are like the fair flow'r in its lustre
Which in the garden enamels the ground:
Near it the bees in play flutter and cluster,
And gaudy butterflies frolic around.
But when once plucked, 'tis no longer alluring,
To Covent Garden 'tis sent (as yet sweet),
There fades and shrinks and grows past all enduring,
Rots, reeks, and dies, and is trod under feet."
This would surely introduce a variety into bar practice, the while it
must materially assist the cause and increase the damages pleaded and
sung for. -
The fair flower, in the case in question, failed to obtain that sym-
athy which twelve true-born Britons generally vouchsafe from a jury-
§: to that time-hallowed object, a female in distress. But the homage
due to the naughtiness of the great was duly paid at the usual cost of
;...". of the vulgar small. A worthy chronometer-maker—being the
father of a foolish son attracted by the “summer flower”—had his
name published in court, to be afterwards sent throughout the world in
the morning papers; whereas another admirer of the summer flower,
being a nobleman, was not nominated; “his name did not transpire;”
his letter to the flower, readin court, being merely read as the epistle of a
noble lord, whilst the name of the ignoble chronometer-maker “is told
to all the hills.” Is the Red Book such a place of refuge for the naughty?
And because a worthy citizen and mathematician Yeeps a shop, and
has a foolish son, shall, his name be gibbeted? And lords, too, to sin
—lords, who are the born monitors and models of plebeian men
What says DANIEL DEFoE on this solemn theme?—“If my own
watch s false, it deceives me and none else; but if the town clock
goes false, it deceives the whole parish.” If the watch of the chrono-
meter-maker's son goes false, it deceives him and none else; but if the
clock of the House of Peers goes false, it deceives—only the simpletons |
who unerringly trust to it. Nevertheless, why should Justice expose
the son of the chronometer-maker, and at the same time hide, in the
folds of her ample gown, a noble lord?
A Sledge-Hammer Argument.
QNE WILLIAM EGLIN was arraigned before the Middlesex Assistant-
Judge for having broken prison, by means of a sledge-hammer left in
his way, “the handle next his hand.” The Assistant-Judge wanted to
know how a man could be condemned for so doing. Were #. himself in
prison, and a sledge-hammer lying in his way, he doubted not he should
do the same thing. Bravo, Assistant-Judge! It would sometimes be
none the worse for justice in the abstract, if the Judge upon the Bench
would—just for a minute or so—taking thought of human nature and
human circumstances, put himself at the bar, and so pass sentence
accordingly.

PSALMODY FOR THE CZAR.
THERE is too much reason to fear that the EMPERoR of Russia is

since the opening of the campaign A pontoon bridge with 500 men

for the Czar! and he has not the gratitude to order a single Te Deum. /
Surely Nicholas is Yºkº away from grace. Where be now
our quotations from the Vulgate; where be your texts from the

seem rather advisable, cannot the Autocrat afford a stave of that sort
If Te Deum is not exactly the sort of thing, why not sing Miserere?
Is it, indeed, too much to suggest that his Imperial. Majesty might as
well at once go down upon his knees in an entirely different spirit, and
chaunt Peccarif
SONG OF THE DEVNA CAMP.
Ame.—“And all to astonish the Browns.”
THE fast English ensign was sent to the fight
Against the tyrannical Czar, , . -
So he sought for a dress not too hideous to sight,
And convenient to wear in the war.
He studied in what he could be most at ease,
When one of his friends about town
Said, “Of course, my good fellow, you’ll dress as youplease,
But, by George, you’ll astonish old BRowN !
“To old regulations you know he’s a slave,
And, if you would spare him a shock
Every hair of your face you will carefully shave,
And appear in a tight-fitting stock.
You may think in hot climates with this to dispense,
But such thoughts are received with a frown;
If your dress were according to good common sense,
You would really astonish old BRowN.”
The fast English ensign this good advice spurned;
The comforts of costume he knew;
Aware that in Turkey the sun and wind burned,
A beard and moustaches he grew;
A handkerchief loosely he tied his neck round,
His shirt collar nicely turned down;
Round his forage cap next a white turban he bound,
And all to astonish old BROWN.
But when he appeared in the eyes of the chief
Whose orders he ventured to brave,
The rage of SIR GEORGE quite exceeded belief,
As he roared out, “Go home, Sir, and shave
A true English soldier in comfort be dressed!
Such new-fangled rigs I’ll put down,
The heads of the army, I hope, Sir, know best
What clothes it should wear,” said SIR BROWN.
FLEAS AND BOOKWORMS AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM.
PUBLIc attention has been directed by the Times to the incommo-
dious condition of the Library, and the unserviceable state of the
Catalogue, of the British Museum. Both appear to be in a sad mess,
and the former, in addition, swarms with fleas, which have no business.
here; for surely the entomological and literary departments should be
kept separate. From all these evils, and particularly from those last
named, the readiest way to free the British Museum would be a liberal
augmentation of the number of foreigners, especially Italians and
- ans, included among the officers of that truly national Institution.
Mk. PANizzi, if he had but an adequate number of his countrymen in
authority under him, º go on devoting his energies to the prose-
ºution of publishers for failing to send copies of their books to the
Museum, and might thus continue adding to the lumber which some of
his assistants would sort, whilst others were engaged in banishing the
vermin, and imparting some degree of cleanliness to the place.
Downing Street News.
We cannot think that Government has prevented newspaper corres-
pondents from accompanying the British forces. If this report were
true, it would evidence an attempt to render the British Public depen-
dent, for the news of the War, on the Invalide Russe, and the Journal
de St. Petersbourg. Surely “dear ABERDEEN” is not so Russian in
his sympathies as all this!
Sermons for Stones.
Foºtherejection of the proposal to transfer the City churches to the
suburbs, there is only one thing to be said, which is that as, accordin
to the proverb, walls have ears, the clergy who officiate in those sacre
edifices will not be entirely in want of an auditory.
So the fast English ensign retired with a sigh
His tailor and barber to see,
And they made him, according to rule, such a guy
As the true English soldier should be ;
With face in a blister and neck in a vice
He’s marching away to renown, , , .
Very wretched, no doubt, but all right in the eyes
Of his martinet leader, SIR BRowN.
But smooth shaven faces and tight-fitting stocks
Have both in their turn had their day,
And now that they’re scouted by Punch, and the vor
Populi, even Browns must obey.
Should his spirit, some short fifty years hence or less,
To our planet look up or look down,
Such changes he’ll see in our brave soldiers' dress
As will truly astonish old BRowN
NO NOTHING IN SCOTLAND ON A SUNDAY.
In Scotland, it seems from cases recently published, you can
not get a dinner on a Sunday. You may starve for what the hotel-
keepers care, before they will give you anything to eat. , Yes, there is
one mouthful of a chance for you—if you take a bed, they will throw
a dinner in. The saying formerly was “No Song, No Sup r”—it
must be altered now, to meet Scotch consciences at least, to “ §. BED,
No DINNER.” But why not improve upon the absurdity, and make
the poor hungry travellers go to bed at once, and eat their dinners
between the sheets? It would be just as tyrannical, and, besides,
would throw a solemnity instead of a table-cloth, over the ceremony.
Or, again, why not insist upon their turning waiters, on the plea that you
are only allowed to give the servants of your establishment any meals
on that day?...It would befine puritanical fun to see gentlemen whisk-
ing about with napkins under their arms, handing toothpicks to the
customers, before they were allowed to swallow a basin of Scotch broth
themselves. As it is, it stands thus:– “Take a bed, and you may eat
—don't sleep in the house, and you may starve, even in sight of the
larder.” Surely, benevolence like this is born (as they say) on the
wrong side of the blanket !
THE EMPIRE OF FOLLY.
It may well be a matter of astonishment that the EMPEROR OF
Russia does not abdicate, for since he has lost his head he can find
little use for his crown.

THAT fashionable journal, the Morning Advertiser, º to be
emulous of the fame of another fashionable journal, of which our
revered friend JENKINs is the inspiring genius. . The Tizer, as in
playful fondness it is called by its patrons, is plunging into dissipation,
º sporting about at West End parties, in a way quite incompatible
with its decorous licensed victualling character. e meet it at a
réunion at LADY GLAMIS’s, glancing jauntily round the aristocratic
grace of JENKINs, that “among the visitors we noticed a brilliant
circle of the corps diplomatique.” As affectionate young matrons say,
the way that child takes notice is extraordinary... But the aspiring
licensed victualler seeks still higher scenes. One of the younger sons
of the DUKE of NEwcasTLE has just joined his vessel, the Dauntless,
and the JENKINs of the Beer-barrels is present when the young noble-
man “takes leave of his Illustrious Young Personal Friend, the Heir-
Apparent.” The farewell, according to our licensed scribe, is “affec-
tionate.” . Now we really must remonstrate against our worthy and
honest friends, the withers, sanctioning this kind of thing. They are
men of practical sense, and know perfectly well that the reporter
who “noticed” the diplomatists, and the other, one who reported the
affectionate farewell, had just as much chance of being invited to LADY
GLAMI's's and to Buckingham Palace, as the two #. little boys
who should come up to the bar of a publichouse and offer lucifers for

of their age. We should like to see his notion of the “farewell” in
question. -
It would jº run thus:—
H. R. H. the P. of W. In parting with you, my dear LoRD CHARLEs,
permit me to say, that while (I admit), envying the duty confided to
you, of serving our common country, and regretting the temporary
separation which alienates me from a valued friend, I cannot but con- |
atulate you upon the prospects of witnessing, under the gallant
º: an addition to the glory of our arms.
Lord C. P. C. Cordially reciprocating those sentiments, your Royal
Highness, so far as the difference in our positions permits me to do,
I would reply, that next to the happiness of serving the nation over
which your º H.’s family preside, is the pleasurable anticipation that
your R. H. may hear that one whom you have condescended to honour
with your friendship has not proved himself altogether unworthy of
the distinction. -
H.R.H. the P. of W. I do not doubt it, my dear, LoRD, CHARLEs,
and I will now invite you to dedicate a glass of our best wine to your
own prosperous career, and to the glory of the British arms.
Lord C. P. C. Most joyfully will I avail myself of your R. H.’s
gracious invitation, and will venture to add, that in combating for the
flag of my country, I shall never º that it bears the arms of a
family whose heir has honoured me with his regards.
H. R. H. the P. of W. This way then, my dear LoRD CHARLEs.
This, no doubt, would be more in conformity with MR. J.ENKINS DE
BEER's ideas of aristocratic manners, than our version, of the inter-
yiew. We must express our hope that the witlers will put a stop to
his vagaries, and insist upon his drawing it a good deal milder.

IMPORTANT FROM THE SEAT OF WAR I
JOURNAL OF THE SIEGE OF SILISTRIA. BY OUR OWN BASHI-BOZOUK.
“Scutari. Tuesday.
“MY DEAR SIR,
“IN order not to be
recognised by the 33rd boys,
whom I knew intimately at
Dundalk § hereby present my
best regards to CoLonEL BLAKE
and the officers of that regi-
ment, who have the best mess
of any regiment in HER
BRITANNIC MAJESTY's service),
and to keep out of the way of
unpleasant rencontres with
GENERAL LORD R–GL–N,
GENERAL H. R. H. THE DUKE
of C–MBR-DGE, and other
acquaintances of happier years,
I º taken the precaution
since my arrival here of dyein
my face, beard, and hands, an
...; a plaister over my nose
and right eye. I use BURGEss's
: walnut ketchup for my face and
hands in preference to India
= soy, which I employed at first:
but for which the flies and
wasps, which abound in this
country, have a great liking.
“Yesterday, as I was having
- an audience of the Sultan’s
mother, the dear SULTANAVALIDEH, a whacking big hornet, attracted by the confounded soy
settled close on my nose, stung me, and occasioned atrocious agonies. Of course I had
to grin, as if nothing was the matter, and continue the conversation, which was most
interesting. When the Sultana left us I could bear the pain no longer, but rubbed my nose,
and tore off the plaister which covered that and my eye.
“It was so swollen that the gallant and excellent English Pr—nce, who made one at our
consultation, very likely could not recognise me. At any rate, he did not. A dancing
dervish (a most holy man, and great favourite of the Sultana's), fetched some leaves out of the
garden, and, having chewed them, fomented my feature, which speedily resumed its own classic
shape. Mem.--To inquire what the plant is, and send some to dear friends at home; where
a {..., of spirit may often get a swelled eye still, praised be luck!—at elections, fairs, an
So Iorºn.
“The splendid proposals which her Highness made to me (in private) on the part of her
imperial son, of course, are out of the question. e young PRINCEss NIJoonA (for those
who like that style of beauty) is lovely certainly. She is but sixteen, and must weigh as many
stone. ... Her eyebrows meet. Her complexion is very fair (though I must say I think she is
painted). Her teeth are not good, owing to the quantity of sweetmeats they take. , When I
go to see the SULTANAVALIDEH famiãlf choked with the lumps of sugar-candy which I am
obliged to swallow whenever I say anything witty, and that, of course, is at every other
observation. It seems NIJoonA remarked me as 1 was riding in the Valley of the Sweet
Waters (her's then must have been the hand which held out the three rhododendrons and
the polyanthus from behind the pink and silver curtains of that emerald-green aroba'), and
was pleased with my personal appearance. NIJoonA thou art not the first, by long chalks,
who has been charmed by this figure! - -
.“Wishing to soothe every lady's disappointment as much as possible -when a hint was
given me in a certain august quarter—I told one of the few falsehoods which I have uttered
in my life, and said I was married in my own country. And the upshot of this silly fib was
to show how useless it is to lie. - - -
“The young lady's imperialº: did not seem to consider my previous marriage
an objection. “All that we shall require is that NIJoonA shall be the first wife; and if the
second makes any objection, my dear Colonel, the Sultana-Mother said, in her arch way,

palaces built for me at Jerusalem, Damascus, and Beyroot-these, I confess, were handsome
offers, not to be attributed so much to my merit, no doubt, as to theſº. which young
NIJooNA had conceived for me: who is, as is well known, her imperial father's favourite, to
whom his Highness can refuse nothing. - -
“The poor thing actually tried to fascinate me by her simple accomplishments, and sang
me one or two songs to her guitar. Asking me if I was also a musician, I took up the
little instrument and sang, ‘Who fears to speak of Ninety-Eight?” (out of my friend
DUFFY's paper,) in a way which brought tears into the eyes of the Pr—nc—ss—s. No wonder
they were affected as the poor Exile sang !
* “But marriage and turning Turk was quite another paire de bottes. When NIJoonA went
weeping out of the room, led away by her maids, and her grandmother put the question to
me point-blank, I was about to answer, point-blank, No!, but a look from my friend, the
dancing dervish, put me on my guard. ... “Madam,” said, I, , ‘I must ask your R-y—l
ºrmission to have some conversation with my reverend friend here regarding the two
aiths, and if he can convince me—then, indeed!” She is a very warm partisan of her creed;
she gave me a couple of little tracts, “The Washerwoman of Therapia, and ‘The Boatman o
the Bosphorus,” which, she said, had converted
a great number of Poles and Hungarians, and left
me after my promising to study these works.’
“‘Unless you intend to come round, MUILI:
Goon,’ said my friend, the dervish, “you had
better put some distance between you and the
rincess. She is a fiery little creature, and will
ve you strangled or poisoned as sure as your
name is what it is.”
“So it seems there is to be no rest for me
-not in Dublin, not in London, not in Peters-
burg, not in Constantinople!, Finding that the
coach was going to Warna that afternoon (and
most uncomfortable conveyances those Turkish
stage-coaches are), I took a place for myself and
my servant in it, with letters to the Governor of
Silistria. And, by the time the clock of the
Mosque of Saint Sophia struck thirteen, (the
hour at which the Sultana-Mother had appointed
me) the next day, I had left Varna, and was on
horseback on the road to Silistria.
“You now understand why my death was an-
nounced, on the very first day of the siege of
this place; a piece of news which put poor
NIJoonA into a dreadful fury; she was so en-
raged to think I had escaped her vengeance. I
do not envy NobBI PASHA, whom she
married since by order of her imperial father.
NoBBI is a quiet man, and she leads him and his
family the deuce's own life.
“The Governor of Silistria welcomed me with
that distinction which I am accustomed to re-
ceive from brave men. Having been just obliged
to hang the colonel of a regiment of , most
refractory Bashi-Bozouks, the Pasha was pleased
to offer me the vacant command, which I ac-

Punch’s HANDBOOKS TO THE CRYSTAL
PALACE.
THE EGYPTIAN COURT.
IMAGINING that we have asked a policeman the nearestway to t,
and that he has civilly told us, to “take the first on the left,” we shall
find ourselves at the end of an avenue of Lions, which would not under
ordinary circumstances be an agreeable promenade; but fancying our:
selves on an equality with any of the Lions of the place we are induced
to enter. We find ourselves opposite to the entrance of a Temple, and
having a sort of matural aversion to the Temple—from legal associations
with which the Lions' mouths, and their formidable amount of jaw,
may have some subtle connection-we pause to examine the exterior.
The unintelligible hieroglyphics that surmount the tian Temple in
the Crystal Palace help to carry us to the Temple in Fleet Street, for
there is a close analogy between the jargon of law and the language of
mystery. We learn, however, that certain strange figures, of which
the least inscrutable are a pair of sugar tongs, a curtain ring, a short
German pipe, and the blade of a knife, are the names of HER MAJESTY
AND PRINCE ALBERT. It is fortunate for the QUEEN..that she has
not to make the sign manual in Egyptian characters, for if she did, she
would be compelled to copy the Royal
pipes over every official document re-
uiring her signature. Qn the frieze we
find a horse-shoe, a billiard ball, a quantity
of strange birds, all #. going
either to hang himself or jump out of
window, and a few other equally brilliant
designs, which we find signify altogether

this palace with a thousand colours, a
thousand decorations, a thousand statues
thousand birds and beasts, a thousand
tanks, and a thousand vases.” Thus lan-
guage is evidently borrowed from an
old declaration in an action for an
assault, in which the defendant was
usually alleged to have given “a thou-
sand blows with a thousand arms, on a thousand eyes, a thousand
noses, and a thousand mouths, whereby the plaintiff had sustained a
thousandpounds damages.” The same inscription is repeated in other
places with the addition of a figure like a chimney

façade have their capitals adorned with palm and

sents life (though it would seem to be limited to a

which is said to stand for purity, though to us it

On entering the door, we see on the wall a representation of the
triumph of RAMEses the THIRD, who, seated in his chariot, looks on at
his scribes counting the number of hands cut from the slain, while the few
bearers in attendance aid him to look coolly on at the shocking spectacle.
On the other side is a battle scene, in which a chief and a charioteer
are both falling by the hand of the king, who, if he has not two strings
to his bow, seems to have at all events two
victims to his arrow. Passing onward we take
a glance at the eight gigantic figures of
RAMEses holding the crook and flail, which
are emblematical of his power to punish and
º cherish and to thrash his people. The
gures in the Egyptian Court are mºre ciphers
compared with the originals; but, though the
directors would not have objected to the highest
figure in point of expense, they were compelled
|by the space at their disposal to depart from
facts, by the diminution of their figures.
One of the most beautiful objects in the
Egyptian Court is a representation—in rather
reduced circumstances—of the famous Temple
of KARNAc at Thebes. This temple was com-
menced by Osiris THE FIRST, and was finished
by some subsequent RAMEses, who put his
name to the work,+though the idea was not
his own—a practice which is still prevalent.
We must not overlook the Temple of ABoo
SIMBEL, though it was overlooked for many
centuries until Burckhardt recognised a row
of heads in the sand, which had running
from the hour glass of Time ages over
them. He fancied that where heads had been
found, temples might be discovered. BELZonſ
and others having cleared away the sand, made -
their way into this wondrous monument in Nubia, which, but for their
researches, might as well have been in Nabibus. RAMEses himself
is, in the original, sixty-one feet high, while the SUN at his side, to
whom he is offering a statue of Truth, is only twenty feet high, and
we cannot help feeling that the offer ºf a statue of Truth comes
with but an ill grace from a figure embodying in its exaggerated size
a most enormous falsehood.
The model in the Crystal Palace is only one tenth of the size of the
original, but the two figures in what is called the Sydendam transept
are full-length copies, and are so capacious that a public house might
started, called the Rameses Head, in the occiput of either one of them.
On the left hand is the Philoe Portico, among the prominent features
of which are the faces of an ape, a hawk, a man, and a jackal. Figures
of this description in wax or porcelain were often placed with a mummy,
and there are cases in which a mon-
key and an ass are found on each
side of a man, who is thus represented
as something between an ape and a
donkey.
Passing through a doorway, we
come to the Inner Egyptian Court,
where we find a º bearer,
walking with his left leg first, which
is the peculiarity of every Egyptian
statue, and would seem to show a
superstition of the Egyptians, that in
placing the left leg first, they were
putting their best leg foremost.
Proceeding through the Court of
Amumothph, which is of the real size,
we come to the façade of the outer
Egyptian Court, which is adorned
§º: more or less interesting
figures: one of them represents NILUs
bringing her productions on a sort
of tray, for the Egyptians always
draw the Nile as a young woman acting
in the capacity of a waitress, or going
round with the tray at a tea-party.
The image of
Truth is frequently introduced as an object
of Egyptian art, and when we look at the false
representations of nature with which Egypt
| abounds, we cannot be surprised that Truth
appears as an image, or, in other words, as an
imaginary character.
Re-entering the Inner Court, we come to
a portico, the capitals of , whose columns
are adorned with a capital imitation of the
lotus. Above them is the head of an Egyptian
|WENUs, whose ears are those of a cow, and are fairspecimens of carving.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
On quitting Egypt by the entrance towards the Greek Court, we
may observe some interesting subjects on the façade, and among
others, is the initiation of the King into the sacred mysteries, by
pouring over him in rapid succession the contents of several vessels.
Having attended the reader through the Egyptian Court, we will
request him to take an imaginary turn with us to Egypt itself, whose
gigantic monuments are the oldest and largest in the world, so that
modern art has never outgrown the ancient, although growing out of
it. The two pyramids were built by two kings, CHEoPs and Nechoso,
who had such an idea of their own greatness that they thought nothing
less than the pyramid would be large enough for them to be buried in.

THE Down FALL OF DownTNG STREET.
The friends of the Ministers have reason to be alarmed at the shakey
condition of the Foreign Office, which seems to threaten the downfall
of at least one department of the Government... It seems that the
Foreign Secretary cannot give a party without having the building
propped up—a fact which we hear without surprise, for if “the party
consists of the old Whig party, a great amount of propping up must be
required. It seems that a dinner cannot be given, because there is no
kitchen; and indeed if there were a kitchen, it is probable there would
be so many. Whig cooks on the look-out for employment, that they
would spoil the broth among them. If the Foreign Secretary cannot
give a dinner cooked at home, we suppose he must have it sent in from
some neighbouring tavern, to which an order for “six beefs,” and so
many breads and vegetables, according to the number of the guests, will
have been previously forwarded. If, however, the Foreign Secretary
| cannot always offer to those who drop in upon him, the luxury of
| “...hot jºints.” it may be convenient at times to give them the “cold

that was not altogether agreeable. The incident probably happene

done while upheld by such a pillar of strength as PALMERston.

With a temerity which was not to have been expected after their
defeat at Odessa, the French and English ships maintained their
position, and awaited the conflict, which, however, they did not venture
to-initiate.
...A summons to surrender having been received by the enemy in
silence, the Gromonassetz fired a ninety-eight pounder, which carried
away the mainmast of the British flagship. A similar ball discharged
º: Wladimir sent two French vessels of 100 and 150 guns to the
OLLOlm.
The enemy then opened a fire upon us, which may be described as
terrific, on account of its noise, but which did comparatively little
damage, although it lasted for full six hours. Our loss amounted to
two or three killed, and about twenty scratched and otherwise slightly
wounded; inclusive of some officers. The bowsprit of the Wadimir
was grazed by a round shot, and the topsail of the Gromonassetz was
torn by the explosion of a shell.
On the part of the enemy the loss must have been very severe.
Besides the French vessels sunk by the Wiadimir, an English line-of-
battle ship was blown up by a red-hot ball, sent right through her
powder magazine by the Gromonassetz. Another shot from the same
vessel constituted a miracle of gunnery, taking º: intended,
under water, and carrying away the propeller of an English screw-
steamer. Most of the other ships of the enemy were dismasted, and
several lost their rudders. -
The unequal contest continued during the greater part of the day,
when the hostile squadron, as much as remained of it, took to flight, as
fast as its disabled condition permitted. Our two gallant little
steamers immediately gave chase, and had nearly overtaken their
opponents, whom they would certainly have captured, but that the
combined fleets, bearing up to the rescue, presented an array of force
so overwhelming that our brave commanders, with due regard to
prudence, felt that they would hardly be justified in engaging it. They

His Imperial Majesty has issued commands for a Te Deum to be sung

ennobled the two Captains of the ºf steamers, BRAGANoFF
and GAMMONowski, conferring on them also the rank of Admirals. Ali
the officers have been proportionably advanced; the seamen have been
raised to the rank of lieutenants; and all the cabin-boys and powder-
monkeys promoted to be midshipmen.
A Difficult Calling.
It may be all very well to say that the office of a tax-gatherer needs
no great ability for the fulfilment of its duties, but there is no employ-
ment which requires such constant application.

much of the stick, it is no wonder that he should take the first oppor-
tunity of cutting it.

A RETIREMENT FOR LORD JOHN RUSSELL.
THE Journal des Débats, in an article on the recent failures of the
English Government, alludes to Lond join Russein. having drowned
his own offspring—his Reform Bill—in a river of his own tears, and
concludes by saying, that there will be no resource for him but Chelsea
or Greenwich. The Débats being the best informed French paper on
English affairs, we may form some idea of the extent of knowledge that
exists in France on matters of the kind, when the highest authority in
the Parisian &. expects LoRD JoHN RUSSELL to end his official
career as a Chelsea pensioner or a Greenwich “collegian.” Fanc
LoRD John in a blue coat and cocked-hat, walking about Greenwic

nation to his political life, which the Journal des Débats seriously
anticipates for LORD John RussBLL, when pointing to Chelsea or
Greenwich as the only alternative that is left to him.
We should like our Parisian contemporary to tell us what is to
become of LoRD ABERDEEN, for whom a Lodge at one of the Park
Gates—with the privilege of selling curds and whey—would perhaps
seem an appropriate retirement in the eyes of one who can see nothing
better than Greenwich Hospital as an asylum for LORD JoHN RUSSELL.

RASCAL WORSHIP.
THERE is a species of cant whereby Mr. Punch has of late been
frequently disgusted, and which he hopes will not, after this warning,
be repeated, to the excitement of nausea on the part of all humanly
organized stomachs. An honest execration of the EMPEROR of Russia
is met with the remark that he is an amiable creature in private life, or
even that he is personally a fine noble fellow. This, not only of the
Monarch who has caused a much greater sum of human suffering than
NERO, if not than all the worst of the CAESARs together, but of the
gentleman who flogs women and forfeits his word! It is not fine to
talk this sort of cant, as those who are addicted to it appear to think;
it does not show any superiority to vulgar feeling, but on the contrary,
a very remarkable sympathy with the class “Snob.” Scarcely a com-
mon murderer is P. in the dock who is not reported as having a
mild expression of countenance, or comes to be hanged without having
numerous instances of benevolence and amiability recorded of him.

SPORTING IN THE SOUTH,
wadded with a moral .*. of the early murderer's ‘.
says the Examiner, “that the propriety of shooting an abolition

HE Richmond Eraminer,

named WARD, is
acquitted for assas-

the matter as only
an opening of what

This is, certainly,

A JUDICIAL LEAP IN THE DARK.
. SERJEANT ADAMS has been sometimes ealled “singular”
in his mode of administering justice, but when we examine
the acts of his deputy, MR. WITHAM, we are enabled to
acquit both of singularity by saying there is decidedly “a
pair, of them.” The other day MR. With AM got hold
of the string so often harped upon by SERJEANT ADAMs,
and the . Deputy...twanged away, at it, in a style of
slap-dashiness quite worthy. of his principal. ...ADAMs
objects to summary jurisdiction, and so does WITHAM,
and so, in fact, do we, if summary jurisdiction is to
consist in entrusting to one man the power of passin
such sentences as are often passed at Clerkenwell an
Middlesex.
Among other cases, tried before the Deputy Assistant-
Judge was one of prison-breaking, of which the accused
was found guilty, when MR. WITHAM, in passing sentence,
declared “he should have done the same thing himself.”
that, “he did not see what the man was to be punished
for,” and that “justice would be satisfied by sentencing
him to twelve months’ hard labour.”
It is rather difficult to get at the rationale of all this;
but it would be a perfectly legitimate logical deduction to
say, that MR. WITHAM, in his own opinion, deserves twelve
months' imprisonment. Against such an authority we
should be sorry to appeal, and therefore, when he says that
he would do as the prisoner has done, we, remembering
that the will is the essence of the deed, and presuming
MR. WITHAM to have been just in inflicting twelve
months' imprisonment for an act which he himself would
have committed, can only conclude that he feels himself
entitled to a year's hard labour. It is true he remarked
that, “he did not see what the prisoner was to be punished
for,” but as Justice is said to be blind, a sentence in the
dark is perhaps excusable.

MUSIC FOR MARS.
THE Scutari Special Correspondent of the Morning Post describes a
military mass which was performed the other day, in the open air by
our French allies at Adrianople. To judge from the following passage
in his account of the mass, it certainly does appear to have been a very
military service indeed:–
“At the elevation of the Host a salvo of five guns was fired, and three colours, sur-
mounted by the Imperial eagle, were dipped, and all the troops presented arms with
bended knees. At this moment the coup d'ail was truly imposing. When the mass
was ended, the “Domine salvum ſac Imperatorem Napoleonem' was chanted, and a gun
announced the end of the ceremony.”
The boom of ordnance does seem a rather odd accompaniment to the
Canon of the Mass. “Gloria in Excelsis, &c. Et in terrá paz” gene-
rally comes next. In a military mass, accompanied with artillery, the
word “Pax” is perhaps ex i. into Paixhans. Or, peradventure, it
is sung very small, and probably drowned by the report of a howitzer,
so that the passage in the Roman liturgy alluded to would be heard as
“Et in terrá”—bang! The Ite Missa est, too, would be appropriately
followed by an explosion in lieu of a benediction. The clash of swords,
moreover, might mingle with the roar of great guns; so that the mass-
music would be regular -music.
These are the reflections which ... to the mind of a
Cockney and a Protestant on perusing the above statement: the author
of which, however, appends to his narrative a comment conceived in a
sublimer spirit; observing that
“It is very gratifying to find that the God of Forces is set before Mahommedans by
the allied armies as the Giver of all victory.”
This may be very gratifying to the Russians; but to whom besides
can it afford any reasonable gratification?...To represent the “God of
Forces” to the Turks as the deity of the allied armies, can only confirm
them in the persuasion that we are idolatrous giaours. Certainly, the
celebration of divine worship by means of cannon is calculated to im-
press them with a notion that we do adore that deity; and perhaps at
this moment they are convinced that Christians venerate the offspring
of JUNO. For further information concerning the “God of Forces”
than what may be found in LEMPRIERE's Classical Dictionary, the corre-
spondent of the Post should resort to a Sunday School, or invite the
visit of a Scripture reader.
Count Pahlen in Parliament.
WE hope, for his own sake, that Count PAHLEN is too wise to return
to Russia. After the {. bestowed upon him by the House of
Lords, he would inevitably be packed off to Siberia.
DIRTY MONEY.
In the Daily News, a MR. LESLIE’s sense of propriety is duly out-
raged by a daily practice:
“A numerous class of men and women who chiefly travel by omnibuses, defile their
lips and even mouths, by holding money between their teeth."
This is intolerable; and marks either the ignorance, or the unseemli-
ness of the offenders. MR. LESLIE pathetically asks—“Can these
persons be aware of the quintessence of filth worked by dirty fingers
into the rims of coins and on their uneven surface, putting aside the
fear of contagion, &c.?”. This ought to be thought of. Considering
too the dirty means by which, in vale of tears, money is sometimes
obtained, the coin, held even in the mouth, is doubly dangerous. Never-
theless, we fear MR. LESLIE preaches to an adder-deaf generation. How
can money be ſoul? Money has no odour, said the Roman emperor.
Pecunia non olet. All money—however obtained—is clean, is the
belief of avery numerous class of persons who do not ride in omnibuses,
but in vehicles of family exclusiveness. Money, like fermenting wine,
cleanses and purges itself of all original foulness; otherwise, could it be
thought, that the most worshipful members of society would continually
have money between their lips—money even in their mouths?
Were it known that money was liable to harbour dirt and infection
would it be necessary to warn stock-jobbing Christians of the peril to
be encountered in the Russian loan P. Nevertheless the benevolence of
a paternal French government has, on its part and the part of England,
warned all French and English subjects against the dirty money offered
with dirty interest by the EMPEROR NIGHoLAs—“Every British sub-
ject”—runs the notification—“subscribing to a loan intended for a
power at war with Great Britain will be guilty of high treason, as
affording aid to the enemies of the QUEEN.” This warning is enough
to spoil the taste of Russian money in the mouth, even of BEN ISRAEL,
making, what before was sweet as the manna of the wilderness, as
foul and defiling as Russian tallow, or lard of Russian wild-boar.
The Glass without the Wine.
WE do not believe the following statement of the Builder.
“A TEMPERANCE “PALACE.'—An arrangement is on foot amongst the friends of
Temperance, offended by the sale of wine, &c., at Sydenham, to purchase the Surrey
Zoological Gardens, and to erect a large building of glass. We have not yet the pre-
cise particulars before us, but understand that it is proposed to raise £100,000 by 100,000
£1 shares, and that the gardens have been provisionally purchased for £25,000."
It is incredible that the teetotallers should make an arrangement for
collecting their disciples, under glass at the Surrey Zoological Gardens,
because this would be, clearly, inviting and encouraging them to make
beasts of themselves.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MATERNAL SOLICITUDE,
Anzious Parent. “Oh, MY DEAR CHARLEs
SPIRITUAL WORKHOUSE GRUEL.
THE subjoined advertisement appears to indicate that the principle
of regaling the inmates of workhouses on a coarser kind and a smaller
quantity of food, is extended to their spiritual dietary:—
YMINGTON UNION.—CHAPLAIN.—The Board of Guardians of
the Lymington Union will, on the 17th July next, APPOINT a CHAPLAIN of
the Workhouse. Salary £50. Duties, a day service, with a sermon every Sunday,
and on Good Friday and Christmas-day, weekly visits to the sick, and generally the
duties of the office as defined by Article 211 of the General Order of the Poor Law
Commissioners of the 24th July, 1847. Applications, with testimonials, to be addressed
to the Board of Guardians, under cover to the Clerk, on or before the 15th July.
Lymington, June 26, 1854. JOSEPH ROBINS, Clerk.
The manna thus provided for paupers at £50 a year by the Poor Law
Commissioners will, those gentlemen perhaps expect, prove deficient
both in quality and amount. The allowance must, at least, be scanty,
considering the number of mouths to be fed; with but one pastor!
Fifty pounds a year salary to a Chaplain may possibly be meant for
a sort of out-door relief to a necessitous clergyman, sufficient just to
keep him, and enable him to go about in a threadbare coat, out at
elbows in fixing so shabby in allowance, the Poor-Law Commis-
sioners must, of course, contemplate a corresponding recipient. They
know, themselves, what a handsome stipend is; enjoying £1500 per
annum apiece.
It would be wrong, however, to impute to the Commissioners a
meaner motive than that which may, in reality, have actuated them.
Perhaps they considered that the Gospel could be preached to the poor
most effectually by the poor; and that a hungry congregation would
give peculiar attention to the discourses of a preacher exhorting them
on an empty stomach.
If a stipend of nineteen shillings a week is all that a Union can afford
for the services of a Workhouse Chaplain, and if it is not thought ab-
stractedly desirable that he should be a starveling and a ragamuffin, it
is to be wished that the poverty of the apostolic man could qualified
by the . which tempered the *. of the Apostles. He
should be allowed to work with his own hands; to add the mending of
shoes to the cure of souls; and to do gardening, carpentry, or any other
odd jobs of an honest nature. Or if, as would be the case of the
reverend gentleman, who should undertake the Lymington Union,
unable to eke out a living by such means for want of time, he ought to
be suffered to go into partnership with a tradesman; or his wife should
be º to set up a chandler's shop, or take in washing, or conduct
a mangle.

| FIRST COUSIN TO CHOLERA.
DR. Robert LEE has written a book, in which
he describes a rate of mortality, more than
20,000 a year above the natural average, as
having prevailed on the confines of Circassia
during the last 28 years, amounting, in round
numbers, to 600,000 deaths. From the same
cause an unknown but enormous loss of life has,
according to DR. LEE, occurred also in Persia
and Poland; besides 300,000 persons swept off in
Turkey during 1828-9; of these 50,000, however,
having been destroyed by the concurrence of the
ordinary plague. To the above victims, the
Doctor adds 30,000 and upwards, fallen in the
Principalities since their occupation: the whole
of these unfortunate, wretches having been
subjects of Russia; and an incalculable number
of Circassians, Persians, Poles, and Turks
having shared their fate. It might be supposed
that DR. LEE is describing the raw of the
Small-pox, Typhus, or Cholera: this is not so;
he is only recounting the murders of the Czar.
It is said, by the way, that the Cholera has
broken out in Cronstadt. Perhaps this is only
a figurative mode of stating that NICHOLAs, in
person, to encourage his troops, has made his
appearance in the garrison.
Eastern Occupation.
THE Anglo-French forces in the East are
called an army of occupation; but whatever
their occupation may be, they seem to be doing
very little. Indeed it may be questioned whether
MR. Joseph MILLER would not be justified in
describing the English troops as doing nothing,
and the French as helping them.
THE BURIAL OF THE SESSION'S BUSINESS.
Not an Act was lºs. came to a vote,

Not e'en SIRTHORP discharged a random shot
At the style in which business was hurried.
We hurried Su ply through at dead of the night,
To account War's necessities turning;
Of HUME and of WILLIAMs making light,
And the candle at both ends burning.
PAM's New Police Bill was laid to rest, -

Election abuses we should have supprest,
But we left them much as we found 'em.
Civil Service schemes we’ve put snugly to bed
(Though TREveLYAN's a troublesome fºllow);
Young Öffenders to deal with, we were to 'ye essayed,
But they’re left till next Session, to mellow.
Largely we puffed, when the Session began,
Our intentions—how deeply we laid 'em ;
But, somehow or other, the House took each plan
And arrangement we'd made, and unmade 'em.
By August the Session's task will be done;
We shall have an excuse for retiring;
And then we may look to see business begun
With more action, and less aspiring.

Scene.—The top of the Boulogne Column.
TIME.-After the Review of Wednesday, July 12th, 1854.
The Emperor (who has been watching the troops depart by the Calais
road). So, my good friend, they are gone. And now let our adored
Nicholas look out. Between the Anglo-French fleet and those brave
fellows, St. Petersburg will be a pleasant locality.
The Protector. Will your Majesty permit me to say one word?
The Emperor. My dear Lord Punch, you can never offend me except
by your silence.
The Protector. The word then, your Mºº which I would offer in
reply to your observation, is simply this. BAH!
The Emperor. You are incapable of incivility, my Lord, and you have
a meaning, for which I will trouble you. -
The Protector. I admire the soldiers we have just inspected, your
Majesty. , I admire your Majesty's fleet in the Baltic. Ineed not say
that I admire our own. all my admiration fails to discern any
particular danger to the EMPEROR OF Russia. Nor, permit me to say
so, does your Majesty discern it.
The Emperor (after a pause and in a low voice). You are a wonderful
Inan.
The Protector (modestly). I am so, your Majesty. '
The Emperor. I believe that you have fathomed a thought which I
had deemed unfathomable.
The fretº. If my instinct is indiscreet, your Majesty, I can only
regret it.
The Emperor. There is no cause for regret. On the contrary, I
rejoice that there is one mind in Europe to which I can freely open my
own. Punch! I am very weary of this humbug war.
The Protector. Your Majesty has properly characterized it.
The Emperor. We are playing another act of the farce. The stage
direction is “Enter several thousand French soldiers, headed by
GENERAL BARAGUAY D'HILLIERs. They parade round the stage,
and march off at upper entrance left, where is a finger-post marked,
To the Baltic Gº".”
The Protector. And for all the good they will do, they may as well
change their dresses behind yonder trees, and return to their vineyards
and cornfields.
The Emperor. True. Oh that we could convert this sham war into a
real one. " Oh for one hour of him whose title you bear.
The Protector. Does your Majesty allude to a certain Chancellor of
the University of Oxford, best known as OLIVER Cromwell.
Russi *peror. Hm Were he England, I being France, where were
ussia i
The Protector. Slightly crumpled, I humbly conceive, your Majesty.
For the jest's sake, imagine me man, Sire, and speak your mind.
The Emperor. We should need little speaking, then, my friend. A
strong man armed keepeth his house, but take two strong men armed
(call them OLIVER and Louis), and every man's house would be theirs
to keep. Answer for him, Punch.
The Protector (sternly). Of a verity, KING of FRANCE, there is man's
work to do, and that right early. Art ready to put in thy sickle?
The Emperor (admiringly.) Good—good. Waiting, OLIVER, It is
England who has been slack, or rather her Government, and its head,
my LoRD ABERDEEN.
The Protector (with a grin smile). Aye. It may have been so. But
I have gone something suddenly to work. Marry, I have swept
cleanly. ABERDEEN, will hinder no longer. The Government is
now certain able scribes who take my orders, and woe to him that
slacketh. Moreover, I have sent two words to DUNDAs, touching
yon Sebastopolis. He had best obey them. |
Emperor. Might I guess—they are “Take it.”
The Protector. Thou hast it. Again, I have sent the Lord PAL-
MERston, to Vienna, to deliver a m e in which, his jaunty soul
delighteth. He will lose no syllable on the road. He is gone to tell
ERANCIs Joseph, that if there be a live Russian in Bucharest º

to expel the Muscovites with the aid of such Hungarians as he can Nicholas has ordered a levy en masse throughout Poland. Each

be Hº: By which route hast thou sent these soldiers to day?
The Emperor. By Calais. -
The Protector. How ! ... Is there no iron road to Konigsberg P
The Emperor. That is in Prussia.
The Protector. Nay, friend, we have some smattering of geography.
England had as good schools in 1599 as in 1854. We º: Some
remembrance, too. of the Rhine, and of certain ancient boundaries of
France. Dost think the muddle-witted sciolist, KING CLIcquot,
would like to see the map of Europe reconstructed after thy fashion?
The Emperor. What is that German song—“The French shall never
have the Rhine?”
The Protector. A song that may need re-setting, if thy troops are not
forwarded and helped on their way—followed, too, (for I know French-
men will not be preceded) by a Prussian army 80,000 strong. Marry,
there will be no mistake, for I have sent LAYARD, the bull-hunter, t
signify as much. -
The Emperor. But the diplomatic negotiations that are going on-
The Protector. Seems to me that they will scarce continue, as I have
recalled all my ambassadors, and as I take in no foreign letters.
Enough of life and of lives has been lied away by such follies. My
Ultimatum has gone to Devna.
The Emperor. In Turkey my orders should be first heard. My army
is the larger, my general the higher in rank.
The Protector (craftily). It may be that I have not forgotten that, but
have bidden RAGLAN and CAMBRIDGE go forth, instantly, as pioneers,
and clear the way for the Marshal of France—if he will give them time.
The Emperor. He will not. In an hour orders shall depart that the
united armies advance upon the enemy. What of Odessa?
The Protector. Nicholas was so pleased with the little that was done
before, that I have given him a theme for another Te Deum. Six ships
were detached from the squadron, and re-visited the place. Odessa ſuit.

'The Protector. I detest profane and rash swearing; yet it seemed
not altogether amiss to remind NAPIER of a vow he made on leavin

have no fleet in the Baltic. Verily, a work is appointed, and a fiery

shrink back from it, until it be utterly accomplished.

KING JUNIPER'S SUNDAY.
KING JUNIPER reigns in his Gin Palace on a Sunday. The Church
closed, KING JUNIPER opens his palace door, and takes down his
palace shutters: MR; HUME’s motion in the House of Commons is
to *: to the Muses the like privileges enjoyed by the alcoholic despot.
Shall the Goat-in-Boots serve out quarterns, half-quarterns of gin; and
shall Painting sit with bolted doors in her National Gallery; Shall

said when, shudderingly, they appealed to the conservators of ancient
. small thing. He only asks of the Government fair
play between public-houses and places of public instruction: he would
merely place the keepers of objects of fine arts and belles lettres on a
level with waiters and tapsters. . If Bulls, Red and Black and White,
be open after church-hours, why should not MR, LAYARD's bulls be
made public P Bulls, not to be taken with beer and tobacco This is
Mk. HUME's question, and the question is variously replied to.
MR. Edward BAINEs has written a letter—long and clear as stream
of pump-water—on the intention of throwing open the Crystal Palace
to its own proprietors on Sundays. Every man's house is his castle, is
the British boast, whether the castle be of flint or of flint-glass. But
MR, BAINEs apprehends in this movement only “the thin end of the
wedge.” Let proprietary enter on a Sunday, and very shortly public
would follow. And what then? Why then, declares MR. BAINEs,
would commence a rivalry between the Church and the Crystal Palace.
He says, “I apprehend it does not admit of the slightest doubt, that
the more pleasure-places you open, the more pleasure-takers there will
be.” Nevertheless, political economy that, with grave looks, dogmatises
upon dºmand regulating supply, might object to the absolute verity of
this. “Use the palace legitimately,” says MR. BAINEs, “and the
most influential persons will”—do what?—“load it with their com-
mendations !” Let SIR Joseph PAXTON take a long, sweet sleep with
that thought; his sleep made delicious by dreams of influential persons
loading his structure—(it will bear them; being built for all sorts of
descending blessings)—with commendations. The roof stood up under
the snows of last winter, and will doubtless support any load cf praise!
But, should the Palace be opened after Church hours, what will be
the inevitable result P Why, our “influential persons will regard its
crystal attractions as the fascinations of the woman who has every
charm but virtue.” The Crystal Palace will, in fact, be only another

at this conviction, M.R. BAINEs must believe the structure doomed;
after a short time, a Crystal Babylon given up to owls and satyrs. In-
fluential people refusing their shillings, in due time the whole structure
will come down with a crash, and who will pick up the pieces?
MR. Edward BAINEs is a Lord of Leeds; one of the Barons of
Broadcloth, who—let the truth be said—are at times a little more
domineering and exclusive than real peers. The Lords of the Ledger
are, now and then, prone to be quite as imperious at least as the Lords
of the Red Book. K. who are these influential persons, in whose
favour or disfavour the Crystal Palace must stand or fall? Is it the
DUKE OF DEVILsDUst? The MARQUIs of Shoddy ? EARL SPINDLEs?
BARon Cottontwist P. All peers with letters patent, the letters being

own Crystal Palace, price one shilling? Really, we think the people
need not be pawed by patronage. The people can see, and judge, and
act for themselves. }. uence may, in its neglected importance, put on
its nightcap and go to sleep; the people can take care of themselves.

another great invading potentate, will have to beat a retreat with
stained laurels.” "... blackened from the ink-horn of the influen-
tial MR. Epward BAINEs; but the ink is of the most harmless sort;
there is in it neither gall nor vinegar to fix its blackness: it will wash

Lord of Leeds, we are to look upon SIR Joseph PAXTQN as only
another sort of PAxtoxoffsky leading a horde of Cossacks against
the morality, and piety of England, the aforesaid Cossacks remaining
for a while disguised in an overcoat of plaster of Paris; and—to the
unsophisticated eyes of the Bench of Bishops—standing as the APOLLO
Brivedere, the Indian Bacchus, ANTINous, and so forth.
In the meanwhile, the gates of the Crystal Palace are closed the
whole of the Sabbath; and in the meanwhile the Marquis of Granby's
Head is open after church hours; and the pewter is crowned with a
crown of froth, and pungently strong the odour of shag in the bowers
of the CIRCE Tea-Gardens.

I accompany the MS. with drawings, which you will please to have
copied by proper persons at home. The one I have hastily dashed off
on this Jº represents myself just now with a little incident that
happened. I give you my honour. I was so tired after twenty-three
| hours in the saddle, or in the trenches, that I did not care to remove
the shell, but let it blaze away at its leisure. It only killed nineteen

pointed the non-commissioned officers to the vacant posts: reserving
the place of Major for my faithful friend, G : * *. Some dis-
turbance may i. take place on account of the appointments, the
Pasha in command of the town naturally liking to have the patronage.
If he breaks all these ill-looking scoundrels, I shall not be a whit put
out of temper. My temper, when I am pleased, is often very fine.
“Inspected the defunct Bimbashi's quarters, and selected out of
his stock such things as suited me. The late villain appears to have
had an ºte for plunder: I have the less remorse in having sup-
pressed him. I found in his rooms thirteen very handsome suits of
clothes, of different but handsome patterns. Selected for every day
wear a pink pelisse, yellow trowsers, and a shawl round my fez: for
Sundays a light blue Cashmere ditto ditto, Shulwars striped white and
| crimson, pea-green morocco boots with silver spurs; and another
equally elegant dress for change—the rest. I distributed among my men.
| Besides the clothes I found, among the villain's effects—
“A desk, marked MR. J. T. Jones, containing £2000 of circular
notes of CouTTs, payable to John Thomas Jones, Esq., with

am sorry to say, have been taken by some one, and were cashed

some innocent family of this yataghan, thinking it was, gold,
the villain was grievously disappointed, for I, could only get
500 piastres for the knife when I sold it at Adrianople.

A GOVERNMENT COUP DE THéâTRE.
_2 PARAGRAPH in the Moniteur
informs us that it has been
determined to make the
French opera a Government
affair,and to add the manage-
ment of a large Theatre to
the other duties of the Minis-
ter of the Interior. Such an
arrangement, would not be
popular in England; but if
it were, we have no doubt
that our present Home Se-
cretary, LoRD PALMERstoN,
would make himself as much
at home in the wings of the
opera as he is in the recesses
= of Downing Street. A life
5 passed behind the scenes of
politics, would find no great
difficulty behind the scenes
of a theatre, and casting the

task of casting the parts in
the drama of Government.
In selecting his instruments a Minister, like a º: selecting his
orchestra, will find many wishing to play first fiddle, who are scarcely
fit to beat a drum, and many who, though they might be useful if they
would act in concert, are so fond of harping on one string, as to be
rejudicial to the harmony that is desired. It would occasionally
}. to some rather absurd questions in the House of Commons, if the
Opera should be made a department of the Government. The following
are a few specimens of the kind of inquiries to which the Operatic
Minister would probably be subjected:—
The HoNour ABLE AUGUSTU's Spooney, seeing the RIGHT, HoN.
SECRETARY FOR THE Hoxſe. DEPARTMENT in his place, would ask
whether there was any truth in the rumour that the indisposition of a
popular tenor, who did not sing on the Ascot Cup day, though adver-
tised to do so, was in any way connected with the race in question, and
whether he, the Home SECRETARY, would have any objection to lay
for fear of alarming the timid little fluttering affectionate creature —

good-naturedly into the enemy's column for my umbrella; it was the

himself very officious in front. -

on the table of the House any correspondence that might have passed
between the popular tenor in question and the Government.
CAPTAIN BALDERDASH would ask whether the military engaged in
fighting on the side of Austria in William Tell, would not be better
employed at the seat of war, and whether they ought not to be imme-
diately ordered out on active service.
The HoNour ABLE ARTHUR TwopeNNY would not wish to embarrass
the Government, but he would merely ask the HomE SECRETARY
whether some arrangement could not be made as to the bones of ad-
mission to the Opera, so that the bones of the aristocracy might not be
unpleasantly mingled with the bones of the general public, and indeed
whether they could not be admitted at separate entrances.
. Such are a few of the questions which might be asked, and as the
time of the House is already sufficiently occupied about unimportant
matters, we should be sorry to see the number increased by adding the
management of the Opera to the duties of the Government.
CIRCUIT GAMBOLS.
(From our Legal Reporter.)
“Several members of the Bar went to Bridport to play a Cricket Match to-day.”
Western Circuit Report, Times, July 19th.
I entered an appearance, and I gazed with sage abstraction,
At the joinder of the issue—at each flannel chose en action :
I heard a writ of summons, and I saw a wicket fall,
As a proof ºf actual ouster in ejectment by a ball:
As with twisters or with rippers, each in turn was then nonsuit,
Each granted to himself a rule his notches to compute:
As the cricketing coparceners to the scorers’ tent did stroll,
But few there found an entry of satisfaction on the roll:
When a writ of execution fierce was sued out—'mid his pain,
The fielder only heard the plea of son assault demesne;
One in trover shapes his action for the ball, where long grass lingers,
While another makes an effort for a Capias, with his fingers:
At last a Stet Processus is granted to the play,
And a long account is stated of the tent costs of the day.

TEMPERANCE TRIP TO BERLIN.
UR legislature has enacted, or
was to have enacted, or is in
course of enacting, a law to
prevent any such expeditions
for the future as that made
by the Quaker peacemakers to
St. Petersburg. No statute,
however, can prevent British
subjects from visiting any
foreign sovereign, into whose
presence they may think
proper to intrude, on an
errand not ostensibly political.
Now there is a subject,
which, though not of a po-
litical nature, relates seriously
to politics, and on which some
of her MAJESTY's subjects
might communicate with the
KING OF PRussia, to the
great advantage not only of
England, but also of all
Europe, in the present state
of affairs.
Certain of the QUEEN's
lieges have of late strenuously
exerted themselves to prevent
the sale of intoxicating liquors
at the Crystal Palace.
thesewell-meaning individuals
could prevent the consump-
tion of such fluids, in the Palace of SANs Souq1, they wºuld achieve a victory
which would probably lead to a very º termination of the war.
Among the many fearful effects of drunkenness, some of the, most frequent
and well known are irresolution, vacillation, want of firmness, indecision,of cha-
racter. The mind of the sot loses its equilibrium, wavers, oscillates, and shakes
similarly with his hand. - - - - -
That decent reserve, and respectful reticence which this periodical always
observes in making any allusion to the frailties of illustrious personages, would
be inconsistent with any remarks more explicit than the above on the very delicate
subject which they distantly relate to. But if the teetotallers would, send, a
deputation to Berlin, to see FREDERICK WILLIAM, and point Qut to him, the
deplorable consequences attendant on excess of champagne, and induce his Majesty
to take the pledge, there can be no doubt that the result would be an attitude,
on his part of steadiness in opposition to the schemes of Russia, much more
consistent with his royal dignity than his present course of tottering backwards
and forwards. And if the friends of temperance were to undertake this enterprise,
they would, since the war is a great hindrance to trade, be minding their own busi-
ness, which is what they are not doing by trying to interfere with the arrangements
for public refreshment at Sydenham.
A WANE AMBITION.
... WE have all heard of a tempest in a tea-pot, but something very like a tempºst
in a chimney-pot has recently occurred, and has fluttered in the leaves of the London
Gazette for a brief period. We read the other day in that much-quoted but rather
dull periodical, the important announcement, that the QUEEN, has, graciously
permitted a certain Lord John or Tom or HARRY and his brother “to use the
name of WANE in addition to that of TEMPEST.” We congratulate the TEMPEST; ºn
having obtained a sort of object for their energies, masmuch as a Vane, is likely
to afford as much play to a Tempest as a weathercock would to a whirlwind.

A PLEASANT CABMAN.
How pleasing 'tis to hear a Cabman tell
A tale, in speech of coarse redundance pruned,
Not only talking decently, but well,
His tongue to mild forbearing accents tuned,
At Worship Street as lately it beſel:
The nicest exquisite that ever swooned
Being o'erpower'd by strong expressions, might
Have listened to John Williºs with delight.
John WILLIAMs is the owner of a cab
Or cabs, for subdolous acumen famed,
And gift of what is sometimes called the gab,
“Cabmen's Attorney-General” thence nicknamed;
At .."º: and Crushers he’s a dab;
Though MR. WILLIAMs would be quite ashamed
That terms, gentility so far beneath,
Should ever leap the palings of his teeth.
Summoned he was by P. C. STANDEN, G.,
Badgeless upon the Shoreditch rank for plying,
*ºthe º: º:
is catalogue of fares, the sight denying;
Albeit with a form of courtesy, yın
The Cab Act contumaciously defying.
Upon which charge, with striking grace of diction,
He blandly deprecated his conviction.
Thus, or to this effect, he spoke—“Now I
Am summoned here for two distinct offences;
Permit me º to reply
To either charge; I care not which commences,
The officer may choose; I quite rely
On what I think a good ground of defence is
Against them both ; first I am charged with not
Producing badge, whereas no badge I’ve got.
“I am the owner of the carriage merely, . .
That I’m the driver there’s no proof to show;
Cabowners to have badges no law, clearly,
ºr. least of no such law I know.
That of one charge disposes, pretty nearly,
I think; the second is, that I, when so
Required, did not produce the book of fares.
Now that I answer thus: the Act declares
“Distinctly that the driver shall be bound,
Not the proprietor, upon desire
His book to show, demanded on the ground,
Either of hiring, or intent to hire
His vehicle; but its provisions found, -
The right that book's Fº to require
Upon no other terms. I must, with deference,
Unto the Act request your worship's reference.
“Then will you see 'tis so. Now I, the express
Interrogation to the constable,
Put, as himself will readily confess,
Did he intend to hire the vehicle?
Distinctly he did not, to that address
He answered; therefore, with assurance full,
To you, Sir, do i, most º
Submit the Act was not infringed by me.”
With charmed attention, MR. HAMMILL heard
The Cabman's plea, so pleasant and polite;
And after having to the Act referred,
Pronounced the mild defendant in the right;
Who left the Court without a vulgar word,
(Nor did he wink his eye, nor. take a sight,”
But only shook his head and smiled) surrounded
By friends who scarce contained their glee unbounded.

Hemp to its best Use.
THose who think that it is better, to teach people not
to commit, crime than to hang them for committing
it, will probably find encouragement in a fact, of which
paper-manufacturers have been reminded by the present
scarcity of rags, namely, that whatever material can be
used for the making of rope, can be used for the making of
paper.

PEOPLE who travel by railroad cannot have failed to observe, at
various stations, formidable notices of this kind:—
“CAUTION.
“John Stubbs was, on the 11th May last, fined Forty Shillings, for writing with his
ring on a window of a railway carriage, that the train was “disgusting slow.’”
* CAUTION.
“HENRY WABstraw and Michael SQUoTT were, on the 9th June, committed to
Lampton goal for a fortnight, for riding in second-class Carriages with third class
tickets, and offering to fight the station master for the difference.”
* CAUTION.
“HABAkkuk Bowling was, on the 13th of Feburary, sentenced to imprisonment for
having insisted upon smoking in one of this company's carriages."
Now we have nothing to say against this mode of gibbeting offenders.
MR. STUBBs and the other frightful criminals were, of course, punished
for the sake of example, and the more publicity that can be given to an
example, the more efficacious it is likely to be. So we are content
that they be thus hung in railway chains. But there is such a thing as
fair play...There is a saying in the Latin Delectus, “The traveller is not
always killed by the thief, but sometimes the thief by the traveller.”
We might adapt this, and remark that the traveller does not always
injure the iſº but sometimes, the railway-man injures the
traveller. ... We may venture to say this, because juries and judges have
said so before us. And therefore we should deem it quite fair, not only
in MessRs. STUBBs, WABSTRAw, SQUoTT, or Bowling, but in any other
railway traveller, to hold out, in his turn, warning and caution to the
railway Company and officials. How station masters or Directors who
might happen to be on the line, would stare to see affixed to all the
hats of the passengers inscriptions to this effect:—
* CAUTION.
“This Railway Company was sentenced by the Court of Queen's Bench on the 3rd
June last, to pay PhINEAs ANDEnson the sum of one hundred pounds, for damages to
his person, caused by the Company's stinginess in not keeping a sufficient number of
officials to provide against accidents.”
“CAUTION.
“On the 5th January, 1854, a Director of the Indirect Sonth Northern and West
Easterly Junction Railway Company was sent to gaol for three months for man-
slaughter, occasioned by an engiue breaking down from neglect.”
* CAUTION.
“At this moment the Railway Company on whose line we are travelling is, by
compulsion of law, paying an annuity of £50, to the family of SAMUEL Stitch, tailor,
who was destroyed by an accident caused by the avarice of the shareholders, the
negligence of the Directors, and the wanton carelessness of the officials.”
We recommend the Office that Assures Travellers against Accidents
to insist upon every assurer wearing upon his hat one of these notices
during a journey. It might tend to diminish the chance of his having
a claim against that office.
CHASTISEMENT IN THE ARMY.
ALTHOUGH we should like to see the Cat disused, we do not desire
that flogging should be altogether abolished in the army." in some
regiments it appears that the junior officers are in the habit of bullying
their comrades after the manner practised by blackguard boys at a
public school. Conducting themselves like juvenile blackguards we
would have them punished as such blackguards are wont to be. Let
them be chastised, more puerorum.r D9 away with the Cat, indeed, in
the Army, but institute the Rod, and keep it in pickle for young lieu-
tenants who are in the habit of beating, and pinching, and “pulling
about” their brother officers.
The Czar's Rubbish.
FROM Jassy a Correspondent of the Morning Post thus writes:–
“The number of the wounded (Russians) on the day of the 7th only, may be imagined
from the fact, that 450 carts laden with them have arrived here.”
Pleasant news for NICHOLAs this, one might think. But what are
four hundred and fifty cart-loads of his wounded soldiers to the CzAR;
Of course he looks upon his whole army as composed of rubbish that
may be carted anywhere—and shot.

PUNCH's HANDBooks TO THE CRYSTAL
PALACE.
THE MEDIAEWAL COURT.
7) cussion, and in-
deed the middle
age of art seems
to be almost as
middle age,
nature, which is,
the female sex, a
subject of much
mystery. There
is much dispute
as to the point at
which mediaeval
art commenced;
but we most of us
know it when we
see it, just as we
can tell a middle-aged woman when we see her, however she may try
to baffle us by an argument as to the point at which the middle age
begins. The Pointed style has been termed the key-note, to the
mediaeval in art, and perhaps the Pointed style, as indicated by the
sharpness of the nose, and other features, that have lost the round-
ness of youth, may be considered characteristic of the middle age in
nature. A mediaeval window has the smoothness, of its arch inter-
rupted by a point, and the middle-aged eyebrow is drawn up into what
is termed a peaked shape, which takes from the eye its arch look.
There is a further analogy between the mediaeval in art and in nature,
both of which resort in middle age to an amount of ornament, which is
equally unknown to the early period of the one and the youth of the
other. With advancing, age ornament becomes more profuse and
elaborate till the º object is almost lost sight of in the gaudy
adornments with which it is overlaid.
Much learning has been bestowed on the origin of the Pointed style,
but we fear that our own º: would be .# *...* but pointed,
if we were to dwell any longer on this rather profitless argument.
MR. Ruskin, throwing overboard all fanciful theories, attributes the
Pointed style to the necessity for throwing off the smow and the rain,
and thus, by reference to the wet, he manages to get rid of a dry
discussion.
Instead of entering any further into the dispute, we will enter into
the Court itself, which, coming from the railway, is on the right hand,
or eastern side of the building. The exterior of the Mediaeval Court
is decorated with statues from Germany, as well as from Wells and
other |. of England. There is the tomb of LoNGUESPER, our old
friend LoNgsword, from Salisbury; and
enemy HENRY THE THIRD from Westminster. The lion has gone from
his feet—a remarkable coincidence with the fact, that the British Lion
would not consent to be trampled on by a sovereign, who made more
than one vain attempt to tre
monument of Bishop PoER, or Poor, in three-quarter relief, which
will suggest to the frivolous mind the question, whether any Bishop
NZºZ R Sºzsºč
sº
-ºš
could have been Poor, and whether anything in the shape of relief;
ought not to be considered superfluous.
Further on is the monument of PHILIPPA, Queen of Edward THE
THIRD, whose crown was for some time in pawn to meet the necessities
of her husband. This needy sovereign wouldFº have #. change
for himself, and spent the proceeds, if he could have managed the affair,
for he pawned his kinsman, the EARL of DERBY, who, if he had met
with . to back him, might have remained for ever, on the shelf as
a melancholy pledge of friendship. Passing by the tombs of some few
others, who, by virtue of their rank and wealth, were buried in Ca-
thedrals, but who #. just as well have been buried in oblivion, we
enter what is called the English Mediaeval Court.
As we go in at the centre we pass under a doorway from Tintern
Abbey, adorned with statues from Wells and Westminster, and find
ãº in a cloister from Gainsborough, in Yorkshire, a combination
which, though pleasing to the eye of taste, is rather embarrassing to the
mind of the geographer. Opposite to us as we enter is the Great Door
from Rochester Cathedral, with all its original colouring and gilding,
which were once very elaborate, but they have been ... the
fingers of Time, who has robbed it of its richness, and on whose hands
all the gilt remains. On the left of the inside of the Cloister is the
door of PRINgE ARTHUR's chapel from Worcester, having at the sides
rise to much dis-
much wrapped in
obscurity as the
IIl
especially among
lying next to him is our old
down English liberty. On the left is a
two crowned kings, whose heads, the Official Guidebooks, tell us, are
“exceedingly well executed ;” but the heads must have been exceed-
ingly well restored, if the execution, was really performed. There are
numerous other objects of interest, but our Handbook would become
a mere Catalogue if we were, to note down separately the lots of
attractive articles with which the Mediaeval Court abounds.
EDIAEVAL, a Wºrd| The early Gothi -
; resiſ,” - ly Gothic sculptors went to nature for their ornaments, and
i. 3. mº were particularly i. in the delineation of the ivy leaf; but the
-> » c
Renaissance, taking French leave with the ivy, completely deprived it
of its fidelity. Among the lesser statues may be noticed a small one,
known, or rather guessed at, as the “Boy Bishop” from the Cathedral
of Salisbury. When the antiquarians have stumbled over a statue,
they are not long in finding a story to match it, and they do not leave
a stone unturned, to †: to any stone that may turn up a legendary
interest. We are told in reference to the alleged “Boy Bishop” that
it was an ancient custom to elect from the children, of the choir, or
singing boys, a “regular Bishop,” who, it is said, did all the Bishop's
work; but it does not appear that he took any of the Bishop's salary.
Some authorities are inclined to believe that the statue of the “Boy
Bishop” represents a regular prelate, and when we remember that
there have been bishops who have been very small men, we are disposed
to concur in the suggestion.
The walls of the Mediaeval Court present, an interesting series of
specimens of the sculptural art, and we find among them more than
one sovereign whom we now see chiselled out of stone, after having
been in his own day chiselled out of his kingdom.
A copy of the celebrated monument of EdwarD THE BLACK PRINCE
from Canterbury Cathedral, occupies a good position in the Mediaev
Court, where may be seen the well known figure of the Prince, with his
head resting on the outside, instead of occupying the inside of his
helmet. It may be as well to observe, that the title of Black
Prince is not proved to have been derived from the armour, of his
Royal Highness having been kept constantly blackleaded, like the
bars of an ordinary º but the name is supposed by some to
have arisen from the black shadows his presence threw on the hopes of
É. French, who always called him the “Noir” after the battle of
ressy.
The last monument we shall notice is that of WILLIAM OF WYKE-
HAM, whose name has been immortalised in connection with the College
of Winchester, and whose association with the Hospital of St. Cross
seems to promise him a second lease of immortality through the medium
of an endless suit in Chancery.
The German Mediaeval Court has many exquisite specimens of art,
and there is near the entrance on the left hand a piece of sculpture,
attributed to KRAFFT, who has shown much artistic cunning. The
figures are distinguished chiefly by the feeling for nature, exhibited in
their hands, and it must be admitted that the artist who has shown in
#. hands a feeling for nature, seems to have got it at the end of his
gers.
The French Mediaeval Court contains many exquisite specimens of
workmanship from France, among which may be noticed a copy o
some magnificent iron-work, from the south door of the Cathedral of
Notre Dame, at Paris. Opinion has been divided on the question,
whether the gates are cast in a mould, or wrought with the hammer;
and even to this day the disputants are, hammering away at the point,
with a violence worthy of the forge, and a windy wordiness suggestive
of the bellows.
The Italian School is also represented in the Mediaeval Court,
through the medium of some works by NINo. and GiovaNN, PISANo,
the latter of whom is the sculptor of a statue in the centre. The figure
is said to be Justice because it holds a pair of scales, but if the sug-

In one of the figures beneath Art may, we are told, be recognised by
a pair of compasses, and Charity by a pair of babies, though there

We cannot quit the Mediaeval Court without expressing our admi-
ration of its beauties, though we cannot go with MR. Ruskin in his
proposed expedition “through the streets of London, pulling down
those brackets and friezes and large names” over the shops of the
tradesmen, in order to supply “each with a plain shop casement with
small frames in it, that people would not think of breaking in order to
be sent to prison.” Our love for the Gothic would be tempered by
our fear of the police, and we should in smashing the largest windows,
put ourselves literally to the greatest panes, with no other attainable
end than the station house. We cannot go the length of those who
object to all decoration except the Gothic, and who insist on the non-
concealment of “hinges, bolts, and nails,” as if something besides the
door is supposed to hang on the hinge, and as if the only way to hit
the right nail on the head is to leave the head visible.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

“DOGS AND MONKEYS 1 »
IN the present dearth of histrionic talent, it is very refreshing to find
not one actor only, but a whole company whom one can praise, without
doing violence to one's feelings as a man and one's principles as a
theatrical critic. It is at, all times very hard work to find out the
merits of MR. CHARLEs KEAN, to abstain from saying uncivil things
of MR. G. W. BROOKE, or to kº down a protest against the blatant
emphasis of MR. ANDERSON. The “heavy lightness” of some of our
most elaborate comedy “gents,” is only less oppressive than the
“serious vanity” of most of our performers in the leading business.
It is melancholy to have no relief from the rags and tatters of the last
French vaudeville, cruelly overdone into English at the Lyceum, better
than three acts of stale horror from the Boulevard du Temple, dished
up afresh with additional pepper, at the Princess's. In short, where-
ever I go, I find all French, but the acting.
I am sorry to say that even M. Dfs[RAIs's admirable troupe of dogs
and monkeys at Cremorne is “from the French.” But as the actors
don’t talk, and confine themselves to a number of “rapid acts,” instead
of one slow play, this is the less felt.
M. DíSIRAIS's troupe is what would be called at Astley's a double
company-one quadruped, the other quadrumanous. Among , the
former there are no less than three low-comedy poodles, whose
stray nut, what actor can resist a bit of fat, or an opportunity of “gag?”
If he does occasionally bolt off the stage and conceal himself in the
flies, he is much more easily caught than MR. SIMs REEves; and,
besides, he never skulks under shelter of a medical certificate, or
insults the public under pretence of making an apology.
I had the pleasure, after the performance, of an introduction to the
company. I found them affablé and good-tempered, and quite free
from that craving for strong flattery which I have generally remarked
among bipeds of the same profession. M. DESIRAIs describes them as
easy to manage—on the whole—but, with them, as with their human
brothers and sisters, firmness is necessary. . If you give way to them
at all they become insubordinate. His rule is never to feed them till
after their performance—but then they are not liable to half salaries or
“no treasury.”
Immediately after acting and #1. they are consigned to small
boxes and shut up in the dark till wanted again. I could not help
wishing that some actors and actresses of my acquaintance could be
subjected to a similar seclusion when not acting.
M. DESIRAIs, like other managers, finds the ladies most difcult to
deal with-and when they do bite, he remarks that they do it with a
peculiar viciousness. He is now training a couple of novices to the
erformance of “la Perche,” and had even attempted to break-in a
arge black monkey and his two young ones to a drawing-room enter-
tainment à la RISLEY. But the parental instincts of the animal revolted
at the idea of making footballs of his own flesh and blood—thus
grotesque º distances FLEXMORE; and a light comedy spaniel,
whose grace and lightness might be usefully studied by our actors in
the same line, while the heavy-business is efficiently supported by a
black retriever, whose gravity reminded me of DippeAR. The monkey-
performers are rather, gymnastic, than, dramatic, artists. But the
‘Star-riders,” and “Cherokee Chiefs,” and . “British Tars,” and
“Bounding Brothers,” and “Italian Brothers,” and “German
Brothers,” and “Olympian Brothers,” and the “Sylphs of the
Circle,” and “Gems of the Arena,” and “Dashing Ecuyères,” of “the
Turkish Pavilion” (or, in º, the male and female horse-
riders in the Cremorne Circus) are quite outstripped by their monkey
rivals in M. DEsſRAIs's employment.
In the first place, the scene of the performance of the latter is
wilder and more exciting. Instead of the everlasting ring, spread with
sawdust, it represents a rocky pass in Kaffreland; and we are re-
minded of the bow-legged Bushman, or the wild Zulu, while witnesing
the rapid act of the Courier of St. Petersburg (with a tail protrudin
in an agony of nervousness) on two poodles, or the characteristic per.
formance of a simious EATON STONE, on the barebacked pointer of:
the Prairies.
In the next place, there is no clown in M. DESIRAIs's Company.
Now, much as we respect the institution of clown to the ring in the
abstract, we are compelled to pronounce your Original Shakespearian
g
showing the inferiority of the monkey to the man, in whom such preju-
i. º: never been found to stand in the way of the amusement of
the public.
Now that the EARL of WICKLow's dog-cart bill is likely to throw
so many industrious animals out of employment, why should not
British philanthropy secure them a subsistence in the theatrical pro-
fession? Let the friends of the dog combine, buy up the lease of
the Opera House from MR. LUMLEy, engage M. DESIRAIs as their
acting manager, and get up a Canine Company—or Dog Dramatic
Establishment.
Jesters, and your Grotesques of the Circle, generally, insufferable bores ºf:
and nuisances. The good old clown has been replaced by a being full of
stupid forwardness and gross vulgarity, but with none of that delightful :
imbecility and incurable want of respect for the Master of the Ring,
which belongs to the ideal clown—the clown of our childhood—the ||
Panurge in motley of Pantagruel in a laced jacket and enamelled
boots, whose mild, wisdom he imposes upon, and, whose whip-lash
he evades, so wonderfully—that emblem of shrewd wit, under the
mask of, folly, mocking pretentiousness in high places, and always
sº best of it.
M. Dr.SIRAIs's monkey-riders stick to their work, and , clearly
don’t care a dump for the audience. There is no grinning bow, no
conceited attitudinising on the part of the gentlemen monkeys—no
ogling and posture-making at the audience on the part of the ladies.
The ring is clearly a serious business with them. Not that nature, does
not occasionally, peep out, as when the Courier of St Petersburg,
forgetting that he is a courier, suddenly feels that he is a monkey,
and instead of bowing to the public at the end of his performance
springs up the side scenes and gibbers and shows his teeth, an
climbs, like the youth in IQNGFELLow’s “Excelsior,” higher and
higher still, till }. singes his tail in the gas-border—a warning to
the ambitigus. As for M. DESIRAIS's IATON, STONE, we decidedly
prefer him to the original. He gives himself no wild Indian airs,
indulges in no humbug about his adventures in the prairies, but is
the aid of a strong pummel on and off an animal, with a back made
tenacious by a coat of rosin. But a small black monkey, with a
face like a reduced elderly refugee, is the ADMIRABLE CRIchton
of the troupe, all accomplished both in arts and arms. He plays the
cymbals, executes a solo on the violin, is, not above performing such
menial offices as sweeping the floor, goes through the manual exercise,
and concludes by loading and firing his musket in a state of abject
terror, which makes the perfection of his drilling more remarkable.
The animal has ...; pursued knowledge under the greatest
difficulties, and has the most, indistinct ideas of the meaning of his
various feats, and the general purport of the whole proceedings of
which he forms a feature. But how many artists do you and I know
who are just as ignorant? How few do we know who are half as
diligent or as unpretending? If he is now and then distracted by a

MR. BRIGHT’s own yiews upon these subjects being pretty well known,

the boldest thing that has been done during, the whole campaign.

IMPORTANT FROM THE SEAT OF WAR I
JOURNAL OF THE SIEGE OF SILISTRIA. BY OUR OWN
- BASHI-BOZOUK.
“Fort of Arab Talia, June 25.
“DEAR SIR,-Some jealous scoundrels,
(I suspect the envious malignity
of a couple of English Officers, who
are making themselves very
officious here) have been complain-
ing of the plundering ºr.
of my Bashi-Bozouks. In an angry
interview with H.E.MUss APAshA
tion with scorn, and challenged
both the English Officers for the
honour of our corps.-N.B. The
Turks do not understand the prac-
tice of civilised European gentle-
men: and MUssa PASHA said
“Suppose Captain B. shoots you,
will that prove you did not take
the Jew Merchant's silver soup-
ladle and diamonds?–Go and
shoot as many Russians as you
Fº MULLIGOON FERIK! but
étus hear ofnomore plundering.’
Jt is in vain to expect in half-
educated men, the refinement
and delicate feelings of gentlemen with a long line of ancestry.
The enemy made three attacks this evening on Arab Tabia. As I
brought in a prisoner, though very much mutilated, MAJOR GENERAL
Count Swigg AMoFF who led the last attack, HIs Excell ENCY MUssa
Fish, was pleased to compliment me, said he would sendºm name to
the Commander-in-Chief for decoration, and look over the affair of the
Jew, who was making a deuce of a disturbayce. - - -
“The affair last night was very, hot, My arm, this morning is
black and blue from lifting iron. The Russians had actually entered
the redoubt and cut down our artillerymen at their guns, when the
Bashi-Bozouks luckily arriving gave a different turn to affairs. We
may expect, a great attack in a day, or two. My prisoner, says that
MARSHAL PASKIEwitsch was in such a rage, as to kick the Major-
General at the head of the column. -
“27. Three tremendous attacks upon Arab Tabia took place to-
night. The first, under the command of GENERAL Count SIUTz of
the Alexander Regiment, was very nearly doing for us...They came on
in spite of the fire of our guns, their drums beating, their officers in
the front waving their hats and cursing and swearing in the most
frightful manner. The Russians actually clambered through the
embrasures and over the guns. Count SLUTz, a very stout man, in
jack boots, was rammed up in an embrasure against a Paixhan gun,
and there i confess'ſ prodded him. After his death the survivors of
the attacking column fell back in much disorder.
at 10:35 by the late Count’s repeater. -
“At 11:22, P.M., the gallant foe returned in still greater force; they
did not fire a shot until they were close upon us, and I heard a yoice
calling out—‘Three hundred thousand silver roubles and the Order of
SAINT ANNE, second class, for the man who brings in, MulligANoFF
dead or alive! I thought I knew the voice. ‘Ha, my boy! I roare
out from the bastion. Hº TUFFSKIN, my boy! How did you like
the bastinado at the Hôtel d'Europe?’, Indeed it was poor TUFFSKIN,
who had arrived only that morning at the army. He will never suffer
the cat-of-nine-tails more. It was the fortune of war, and now he is
no more I can do justice to a gallant enemy. I gave his earrings to
little Rhododactylos, on º return to my quarters after -
. “THE THIRD ATTACK, which was the most severe of all. By this
time ammunition had been luckily brought to us in the fort, and as the
enemy came up we received him with a fire so murderous, that 452
men were killed, and 2706 wounded, by the first discharge. We gave
them a second by the time they were up to our guns, and then rushing
out on the disordered column, my gallant. Bashi-Bozouks drove the
storming party back three miles through their own entrenchments and
into the 1)anube, where, such was their impetuosity, many of my
fellows were actually drowned with the Russians. I had marked and
seized an old officer who had been making himself particularly con-
spicuous, and having broken my sword was pummeling him most
severely with the handle about the face and ribs, when he cried out in
very good French, “Tenez, MULLIGANOFF! Je me rends. Je suis le
MARéchal PRINCE PASKik’..... but I heard no more, for a shot
entered my shoulder and down I dropped. Provoking.

I took my share of the chivalric meal; and then had the conical ball
extracted, which had given me much annoyance. Prisoners who came
in this day, the 28th, announced that PRINCE PAsKIEwiTsch had
received some severe contusions the night before, and that PRInce
GoRTSCHAKQFF had resumed the command of the siege.
“30. Had some fever from my wound. The fire of the enemy was
so hot that no less than twenty-nine cannon balls and four shells fell
into my room, which burst there, and filled the place with smoke. I
could not move, as the surgeon had forbidden me to stir, even taking
away my pantaloons, so as to prevent the possibility of my quitting my
apartment. In the intervals of the firing my charming RHoDoDACTYLos
was so attentive and kind to the poor wounded Bashi-Bozouk, that my
heart melted towards, the dear girl. I offered her my hand, on
condition, of course, that she would separate from the Greek schism,
and the blushing young creature gave me her own rosy fingers in
ply.
“July 1. The siege is raised. The Russians are in full retreat, my
Bashi-Bozouks after them. I am so weak that I cannot move from my
bed. Cowards and detractors have been blackening my character to
SAMMI PASHA, who has now the command of Silistria, and I am a
prisoner. I who saved Silistria! -
“2., RhopopACTylos was allowed to come in to me with a little
calves’ foot jelly, which she had been making. I told the dear girl
where I had secreted my #. viz. in a hole under the pumpkin
bed in the garden of the house where poor old PolypHLOESB2Eos dis-
covered me investing, some of my F. on the 23rd. I was in the
hole, spade in hand, digging, and thereby saved my life; for a round
shot took off Poly PHLºsBoeos's head just over me; and the poor man
thus paid for his curiosity. -

Bayswater, will return the BIBLE and PRAYRR Book left in the cab, he shall be well
rewarded.
The question which occurs to most of us, on reading the above, is
whether any existing Cabman would know a Bible and a Prayer Book
if he saw them, as the chances would be much against his ever having
Perhaps, however, the effect of the fore-
going advertisement has been to elicit a circumstance which may form
the basis of an affecting story. Possibly the volumes have been returned
by a Cabman who never returned any property that he found in his
vehicle before; but who, accidentally opening them, and perusing a
rtion of their contents, was thereby induced to abandon the error of
is ways; eschew gin and beer in excess, and extortion, insolence and
bad language altogether, becoming civil, honest, and sober.
WHAT IS BRIBERY P
HoNounaBLE Members seem to be in a state of much uncertainty as
to what is or is not bribery, under the new Bill, and some curious
cases have been put, which are certainly rather puzzling. MR. BANKEs
thinks it ought not to be considered bribery to “refresh”, a voter, and
the honourable member evidently thinks that the franchise might be
safely “wetted” with an occasional pot of beer, lest the voter should
neglect a merely dry privilege. Considering that the freedom of elec-
tion has often been swamped in stout, ale, porter, and other compounds
we think the legislature should be cautious in putting the Beer barre
—or rather the tap—into the hands of Candidates. Many an M.P.
who has been º: to represent a borough, has in fact represented
so many hogsheads of *...i. and there are some, who, instead of
entering the House as members for such and such a place, should have
taken their seats for so many pints of double X.

IMPROVEMENT IN IRISH AFFAIRS.
“WBoo!—WILL ANY JINTLEMAN BE so ENGAGIN. As To THREAD ON
-
THE TAIL or ME REGISTRERED PALLYTorº”
SEVEN CASES FOR THE POLICE.
THE knaves who º to read the stars for the fools are, it seems;
not extinct, although a good many of them have involuntarily exchanged
their mock observations of the revolutions of the planets for real
acquaintance with those of the treadmill. Mr. Punch has been favoured
with an assortment of cards and other invitations of some of the scamps,
and he perceives, with º that the police are not so vigorously
ºin extirpating the breed as they might be. No fewer than
seven of such documents lie—in every sense—before him.
One impudent vagabond, who calls himself an Astral Professor,
excels in English composition. His ºffiche runs thus:-
“The Stars do teach as well as shine.
“NATIvities CALCULATED AND Honary Questions Answened, whereby persons
are warned of impending danger or encouraged to pursuits which promise success
relating to Love, Marriage, Business or Pleasure, Sickness or Health, &c. &c., solved
by Astronomical Calculations on the true principles of the venerable science of Astro-
logy. Terms, for Nativities, 5s. according to length, &c. Horary Questions, from 1s.
Planets Transits, showing their operating influences for the current year, 58.
“Diseases cured by Herbs, under the influence of the Planets which rule them, being
the safest remedy, as minerals, &c. have taken away millions of our fellow-creatures!!!
Advice and Mode of Diet, 2s. 6d.”
It is hardly probable that º who is idiot enough to think of
consulting the Professor, is likely to read Punch, and therefore the
latter merely exhibits these evidences of folly for the compassionate
smile of those possessed of common sense. Else it might not be amiss
to insist upon attention being paid to the Professor's wretched gib-
berish. e professes to answer questions “whereby persons are
warned”—warned by their own questions. And his clients are
encouraged to “pursuits which promise success relating to sickness.”
Surely one of these must be the pursuit of an emetic, an article which
perhaps the quack sells, in addition to his “herbs, under the influence
of the planets which rule them.” We should like to know something
about this vegetable astronomy, and how the fellow found out that
Mercury and Venus have no better business than the minding kitchen-
gardens. There is one herb, however, which we should very much like
to administer to the Professor himself—the herb our old friend
RABELAIs calls Pantagruelion. Not, we need hardly say, in the digni-
fied form of a halter, but in nine doses, simultaneously administered every
morning for a week, at the “fortunate hour” when the planet Mastrix,
or the Flogger, enters the House of Correction, in conjunction with
Felis, or the Cat.
Another impostor heads his card “Astrology,” and in some dirty
den, whose obscurity requires a whole string of directions, (No. 3,
Stench Street, Foul Street, Muck Lane, Whitechapel),
“Answers all Questions relative to the Affairs of Human Life, as Marriages, Sea
Voyages, long or short Journeys, lost or hidden Treasure, &c. Nativities Cast.
Letters Post-paid.”
A third spells so charmingly that his card must be reproduced lite.
ratin, name and address excepted:—
“Phonogostic Astronomy.—MR. * * * * Continues with great success to answer
Questions upon Buisness, or any other undertakings of importance.—N.B. Bread Guard
Manufacturer.”
. The “pronºgostic” astronomer has so much to do that he has no
time to mind his spelling. His “bread guard” was beyond our
comprehension, but, luckily, ºf him with the next quack, we got
a clue to the mystery. Here is the fourth:-
“W. *, *, * * Bookseller and Stationer, Dealer in Almamacks, Astrological
Books, and Ephemeris, Questions answered on Life or Health, Removais, marriages,
absent Friends, Business, Legacies, and any kind of chance speculation whatsoever.
Nativities calculated, &c. Braid Guard manufacturer. Umbrellas made and repaired.
Terms moderate. Letters must contain a Stamp.”
This gentleman not only reads the skies, but makes machines for
protecting you ainst their influences. We fancy the great astronomer
ing his rounds, Hany new planets to consult Hany old um-
ſellas to mend ?” ...And it seems that “braid guard” is the article in
which the pronogostic and the umbrella-man also deal—we believe it is
the material of which ..". are made, articles which anybody
venturing into the astrological den is very likely to need.
Next comes a more pretentious party. He dates from the city over
whose Cathedral the ancient Nichoias is said not to look with a
cheerful countenance, though the sight of the wretched folly, whose
existence is implied in such an advertisement, might comfort the First
Whig. ... He—we mean the quack—has the presumption to start with a
º motto from honest ELIHU, Burhitt, for the which we
should like nothing better than to see that honest blacksmith take him
lm. º for a couple of minutes—probably he will when we tell him to
what he is made sponsor.
“Mn...". * * * Mathematical Projector of Zodiacal Planispheres, and Professor
of Genethliacal, Horary, Mundane, and Medical Astrology, may be consulted on all
important subjects referring to human destiny. All questions are scientifically
answered, according to the position and configuration of the planetary orbs, on Life,
Health, Lºve, Marriage, Pecuniary affairs, Sickness, and the probable duration of

portant advice on Removals and Emigration, so essentially required in all adventures

beneficial pursuits in life they may be qualified to follow, if destined to arrive at
maturity... • * can also state the periods when the body will be predisposed to sick-
mess, accidents, &c. In order to insure positive remarks on Nativities, it is necessary
to forward a notice of the correct time and place of birth.
“" " " , being the only Professor in the Midland Counties who holds a Diploma
from the British Scientific Association, and whose experience in the Celestial science
over forty years, amateurs and others may with confidence rely upon obtaining genuine
instructions, and important revelations.”
For impudence and nonsense this precious announcement beats most
things of the kind. However, we will leave the gentleman to the
enraged blacksmith, assurin the friend, that if stalwart, ELIHU does
see these lines, a period when an Astrologer's “body will be predis-
posed to an accident,” will not be * off. -
No. 6 on our list is more humble. He only goes in for
“Prognostic Astaonomy, and begs to inform his Friends and the Public in general,
he still continues to give advice to those Ladies and Gentlemen who may favour him
with their time of Birth. Nativities calculated on Mathematical Principles—
N.B. Please to observe the Name on the door.”
He is as polite as a hungry dodger, should be—favour him with
your time of birth, and please observe the name on the door. He is
º worth notice. But we have reserved the climax as a bonne
|*. Here is a production of real note. It purports to be a pre-
diction of the fortune of a young lady of exalted rank, whose illustrious
position exposes her to the impertinence of such creatures as those
who issue, the following handbill. They date, from St. Luke's, so
are probably on a visit to some of their dupes. The lady is one of the
|Princesses, of whom a firm of impostors cackles thus:-
“At the given time of the Royal Native's birth, the sign Pisces arose, giving the
benevolent Planet Venus as her ruling star. We consider her nativity as fortunate,
and she will live in great esteem, and be much respected in society. The Moon in
Scorpio makes her cheerful, agreeable, pleasant, just, and kind; of good temper and
disposition, fond of music, painting, poetry, singing, dancing, reading, also gives a
partiality for changes and witnessing many strange and curious scenes, generally a
favorite and much admired by Gentlemen. In all kinds of pleasures, love affairs
parties, &c., the Royal Native will find her own sex to be her enemies, and they wili
deceive her often. She will travel and see many different places, have many removals
and changes of residence. Of marriage, her husband will be above the middle stature,
good looking, of fair complexion, dark hair, a sharp, acute, and active man, of a
pleasant, jocular, and flexible disposition, a free and generous spirit, and in general
very much respected and beloved. We judge the Royal Princess will marry about the
age of 22 years and 4 months.”
And for rubbish and vulgarity of this kind, persons are actually
found to pay. This is the sort of trash, by vending which RAPHAEis
and ZADKIELs, and URIELs, and other angelic gentlemen (who would
º consider a street pickpocket a dishonest, man) get their
iving. Comment upon such delirious jargon would be almost as
absurd as the thing itself. . . - - - - -
Truly, º have something to learn, even in this age of enlighten-
ment, and if Evangelicals and Tractarians were not so very º
battering one another in riding-houses upon questions of chants ºn
shirts, we would ask them to consider whether education be not a
thing for, which there is still some little room. However, we must
wait until it is settled whether “Amen” should be said or sung.

SUNDAY FOR THE SUPERIOR CLASSES.
~~ - E attended a Meeting yes-
7 terday held at the Cat and
\ºf Fiddle, the large tap of
which public house was
densely crowded by per-
sons chiefly of the lower
orders. The object of this
concourse was, to recipro-
cate the kind attention
and solicitude of the su-
perior classes in endea-
vouring to enforce the
observance of the Sunday
on the ºº::
public houses, and barring
the doors of all places of
amusementandrecreation.
Numerous speeches were
made by working men, ex-
pressive of the great obli-
gation under they
felt themselves to those
who, not content with sel-
fishly minding their own
religious business, were
so kind as to devote their
principal attention to that
of others. It was unani-
mously agreed that such
- disinterestedness ought to
~~< be met in a corresponding
spirit; and a resolution
was adopted for the presentation of a petition to Parliament demanding the closure
of all clubhouses on Sunday, and the exclusion, to be carried into effect by the
º: of the mobility and gentry from their own parks and gardens, on the day
of rest.
The petition further required the prohibition of hot dinners on that festival, and
also of all other superfluous dressing; namely, the excessive decoration of the
person, in which the better orders, so called, are too prone to indulge. Much stress
was laid on the painful fact that carriages, belonging to the aristocracy, were to
be seen on Sunday standing at church doors, in the charge of domestics,
bedizened in ostentatious liveries, and having their hair plastered and powdered;
operations involving an amount of work wholly unnecessary. All present appeared
to feel that one good turn deserves another; and that the grand principle to be
observed, in spiritual as well as in temporal matters, is to consult the good of
our neighbour rather than our own. The facility º, this method of prac-
tising piety was particularly insisted on. The utmost harmony of sentiment
pervaded the assembly, and it appeared to be actuated by the best possible spirit.
AN ARISTOCRATIC AWALANCHE. .
THE Morning Post gave the other, day a fearful account of the falling of an
avalanche (in shape of a pane of glass from a skylight) at the “reception” of
the MARCHIONEss of WESTMINSTER. This result of the negligence of the glazier
seems to have caused as much consternation as a casualty from a glacier, among
the assembled visitors, none of whom, however, were smothered by the débris,
though MR. Augustus LUMLEY was unfortunately under the skylight when the
pane tumbled. The affairspread such dismay among the aristocratic group, whose
nerves appear to have been frightfully shattered by the breaking of the window,
that, “SIR MICHAEL SHAw STEwART and other gentlemen, weutin instant search
of medical assistance!” The doctors' night-bells in the neighbourhood seem to
have been rung by SIR Michael and his frightened followers with such effect,
that “several surgeons” were soon on the spot, and MR. LUMLEy's face º
been instantly placed in “several” professional hands, was found to have sustaine
a scratch, or to use the technical lan e of the Post, an “injury of a superficial
nature.” We are rather surprised at the non-issue of a series of bulletins to allay the
anxiety of that part of the public which maybe supposed to take an interest in MR.
LuMºy’s countenance. Something like the following might have been satisfactory.
1 o’Clock A.M.–The scratch has been measured; it exceeds one inch in length.
. 2 º’Clock-A consultation has taken place among the “several” surgeons, who
jointly and severally recommend court-plaister. - -
5 Minutes past 2–Court-plaister has been applied, and gave its adhesion with
great rapidity.
* Pasſ. 2.-MR. LUMLEY has passed a quiet half-hour, and is better.
3.0'Clock-The “several” surgeons have had another consultation, and propose
to “exhibit” gold-beater's sº the state of the scratch be satisfactory.
* Past 3-The patient has just submitted to the operation of removing the court-
plaister, which was performed by one of the surgeons in the presence of the
“several” others, so promptly called in by SIR Michael Shaw STEwART and
the other gentlemen who ran for assistance.
4 o’Clock-The epidermis has united under the gold-beater's skin, and the
patient being pronounced convalescent by the “several”
surgeons, who have held another consultation, no further
bulletin will be issued.
BETWEEN BULL AND BEAR.
A BRACE of vultures,--black and foul both—
On a guide-post I saw perching:
Now back to back, now cheek by #. both,
To right and left alternate lurching.
Two names that guide-post's arms display SO
That every one who runs may read 'em :
As one to Slavery shows the way, so
The other points the road to Freedom,
Never from more unpleasant weather
Shifty and sly for shelter cowering,
sº two º birds* ºt. -
gainst a sky more ering.
Why spread you not your pinions,
º the gathering storm bursts o'er you?
Why halt you betwixt two opinions,
ith roads opposed so plain before you?”
They shake their hideous h and answer
-- In a croaking High-Dutch chorus, -
How, as a He man,
Ask us to move, with *iºc ore us?
Just look each branching road there,
And of our doubt you'll see the cause, Sir.
In those two rampant brutes bestowed there, ...
Bristling with horns, and teeth, and claws, Sir.”
And then I looked and saw the reason,
Why these 'cute vultures kept their perches:
In spite of the inclement season
And their uneasy mutual lurches;
Barring the road to Freedom, tumbled
sº º º: Ursa .!
opping the path to Slavery, grum
*ś Bull-that tough old stager!
Then, quoth the Vultures, “Fain on Freedom
We'd turn our backs, and hold with Bruin:
But if the Bull should toss and bleed him,
To side with him might be our ruin.
But if from Slavery-pice versä–
We turn and trust the Bull's alliance,
Should Taurus be upset by Ursa,
Where should webe, if once we fly hence?
“So, clearly, 'tis our safest plan, Sir,
W le each in turn his proffer urges,
To sit as long as eer we can, Sir
'...At this point where the road diverges.
We think the Bull is fool enough, Sir,
To stay, till we have made our minds up;
For though the animal looks gruff, Sir—
Without a fight what odds he winds up?
“For our own º our wish is strong, Sir,
To see poor Bruin get the better:
As carrion-provider, long, Sir
Each of us owns himself his debtor.
But as, if either floor the other,
We vultures º shall suffer,
Our game is still war's fire to smother,
And act between them as a buffer.
--
“Only you go away and leave us
To hum the Bull a little longer;
Say what we like, he’ll still believe us,
And every hour the Bear gets stronger.
While the Bull stays on our excuses-
Of course we speak him very fair, Sir—
Histime and fighting pluck he loses,
In point of fact forgets the Bear, Sir.
“º the Bull won't be a mover
Till in his boat we vultures pull, Sir-
Our game is still to tide things over—
To act with Bear, and talk with Bull, Sir.
But if the Bull will fight—and flies off
From Protocol and Ultimatum,
At worst 'tis but to fling disguise off,
And help our friend the Bear to bait him 1".

THE following announcement, according to a contem-

“To all official documents published in the Principalities in which the
name of the EMPERon Nicholas occurs, the words Protector of the

Our own correspondent informs us that Nicholas has

secution of my mighty scheme of universal empire, I have
thought proper to begin by taking you under my protection,
that protection which Ipurpose extending to all the nations
of the earth. -
I shall protect you from the evils arising from excess of
food, by sending soldiers among you to destroy those crops
with which your ground is encumbered, and whereof the
harvest imposes so heavy a task upon you.
My armies shall, protect your souls from the tyranny
exercised by Avarice over most persons who have great
possessions, by relieving, you of most of your money and
goods, and nearly º; you possess. They shall pro-
tect your bodies from cold by the conflagrations which
they will kindle in retreating (that is feigning to retreat)

AS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL 1
. YES, MR. LAING—as clear and unwrinkled, quite—your open, spark-
ling account of the ledger condition of the Crystal Palace, as made
and delivered to Crystal Shareholders in particular, and to the
world in general. The GRESHAM Grasshopper might have been heard
by the fine, monetary ear, to give a blithe chirp at debtor and creditor
account; and the spirit of CRQAKER—a spirit that, it is its function,
pervades all things for a time—been heard to squeak like a rat in a trap
at the manifest, declared prosperity of the Crystal Glory that, like unto
º soap-bubble, was, to shine awhile, and then, bubble-like,
reak and vanish. Nevertheless, CRoAKER is a serviceable agent,
though a spirit “least erect.” Öld as the hills, and in defiance of a
thousand rebuffs, CRoAKER is still as active and vigorous, as when he
took an invisible place in the Ark, and declared the world's vessel in no
way seaworthy; but—the thing had been so hastily built; the wood
was so green, and the pitch of the most crude and irretentive quality
--but that world's ship must founder, go irrevocably to the bottom.
She was too long in the back, too narrow in the beam, and go she must
It proved otherwise. And then CRoAKER—what was the spirit's
name in the days before the Deluge we know not, but our haphazard
rendering of it is CRoAKER the º; the Ark, with the
creeping things, groaned at the miry earth; foretelling the utter
annihilation of corn-seed, vine-stocks, lentils. The whole world was a
world of mud; and—hapless race of man!—there was nought left for the
kind, but to stick in it. Nevertheless, CRoAKER, in due season, ate
best wheaten bread, drank delicious wine, and comforted his still-
dº; stomach with mess of savoury pottage.
And from the flood downwards, CRoAKER has been, among men
chuckling at unborn disaster, and rubbing his thin, dry hands at calamity
that never comes! In that year of human presumption, 1851, was not
CROAKER ever present in Hyde Park, hugging himself, as the Crystal
Palace rose-hugging himself with the thought of its certain destruc.
tion? The wind would enter the Palace, a very high, tall, wind would
some day enter that huge mountain of brittleness, and—like the effect
of a hurricane entering an umbrella—like an umbrella, it would be
turned, inside out!. CRQAKER's thin blood warmed, and his sharp
pointed ears were pricked with the future music of the warning crash i
Crystal Palace? Wait for the first high wind, and you will have a
Crystal Chaos. - -
º: was very provoking—but who, in the name of novelty, could have
foreseen it? §. Crystal Innovation did not tumble in—neither was
it blown, out; but, its purpose accomplished, was soberly taken to
pieces, bit by bit, and there it is, or nearly all of it, shining and glisten-
ing the Crystal Crown of Sydenham Hill. . Nevertheless, the thing
j not do. It is too far from the resort of civilised men..., London
will never undertake such a long, tedious, time-consuming º:
Had it been built up again on Battersea flat, there might have been
just a forlorn hope of its success. But Sydenham Hill!. As well pitch
the building on Salisbury Plain. This time, CRoAKER is really com-
forted. There was a chance for the folly of 1851—but what can be
hoped for the Insanity of 1854? Nevertheless, SIR Joseph Paxton
is not only at large; but is to be seen everywhere going about—and
sometimes in half-a-dozen places at once—without a keeper.
d now, MR. LAING delivers his. Crystal-clear account of the
directors’ stewardship; and CROAKER bites his thumb, disgusted and
disappointed People—but then they are all insane-by tens and
twenties of thousands, betake themselves to the Crystal Palace; and
what is more, going once, they must go twice; going twice, they are
compelled to go three times; going thrice, it becomes in them a fixed,
determined idea to go as often as life and its duties will permit them.
A mad world, my masters—cries CROAKER, whom here we leave—
“Mad world, and Crystal Bedlam!” , .
MR. LAING, having disposed of his bright array of figures—for the
accounts were clear as the fabric whereof they were the numeral
representatives—did not attempt to disguise from the perilled share-
i. the fact of an alarming opposition. The Crystal Palace of
Sydenham was to be opposed by a Crystal Bear-Garden at Walworth !
e teetotallers, all wormwood at the thoughts of the bitter beer on
tap in the Crystal Palace, had resolved to purchase-nay, had purchased
the Surrey Zoological Gardens, and were determined to let loose the
lions on the bacchanals of Sydenham! Alligators were already on their
passage to strengthen the crocodile interest, and a live mermaid
secured, who would, of course, appear without her customary glass.
There is moreover an aban * rum-addicted mandril, at the
Gardens at the present hour—it is said, much given to alcoholic fasci-

It might be supposed that the teetotallers ought to content them.
selves with these manifestations of their own purity, without insisting
upon ºf cold water upon everybody and everywhere else. But
it is not so. The Crystal Company—such was the terrible accusation—
had broken faith with a distinguished waterman, inasmuch as they
vended sundry abominations known as port, sherry, bottled stout, and
bitter beer to the unguarded Briton.
MR. LAING, with unblushing impenitence, confessed to the fact.
He was even lost, hardened enough to declare that, after hours' work-
ing in the Palace, his forlorn soul had yearned for a glass of the
strength of malt, flavoured with the bitterness of hops. Without
enigma—he meant bitter beer. He, moreover, confessed to what might
be called broken faith; but which he considered amended determina-
tion. On reflection, it been thought better that men, under the
Crystal roof, should temperately refresh themselves, all mutually sus:
taining one another even by their own self-respect of the decencies of
life, there and then in their own, Crystal Palace,—-than that, turned
away hungering and athirst, they should be absorbed in the holes and
corners of surrounding public houses. Is it not better that Robinson
—in the full light of his own Palace, with humanising elevating objects
all around—should there and them quaff even his bottle of stout, better
than that he should enter the hole and corner parlour of the Devil-in-a-
Bush, and there obscurely drink and smoke, and smoke and drink? In
the Crystal Palace, Robinson's soul delights with beauty; in the pot-
*::::: the said soul may haply drop and wallow in the sawdust of a
spittoon. -
Nevertheless, an earnest, good man-hight CHARLEs GILPIN-cried
aloud for teetotalism, frankly and fervently denouncing the heathenism
of LAING, declared and shown in a glass of bitter beer. “Water
Water!” was the cry of the teetotaller. -
And then arose SIR. Joseph PAxton. (“And Joseph was a goodly
person and well-favoured.”) And SIR. Joseph, ºniº his mouth, even
as the mouth of the Thames, promised, water. Yes; most ha py

THE CHEMISTRY OF COMMON DOMESTIC LIFE.
! (By a Strong-Minded Woman—with a strong Chemical Turn.)
THE subjects to be treated in this interesting series—and into which
will be thrown the experience of a long married life—will be:–
: No. 1.-The AIR we breathe, and why our dear children (bless them!)
always require a change of it at a certain period of the year.
2.—The Cold MEAT we eat, and why it generally produces ill
humour when there is no pudding after it.
3.—The Joints we cook at home, and the Joints that are cooked
for us in a lodging-house, and how the latter invariably lose
so much more in the cooking.
4.-The PANCAKEs we fry and the wonderful PUDDINGs we
contrive, whenever there is a doubt, whether there will be
sufficient for dinner.
. 5.-The Pot-Luck that our husbands will ist in bringing
their friends home to partake of, and the various STEws
and BROILs that always come out of it.
6.—The LUNchEoNs we enjoy when alone, and the DINNERs
we cannot touch when there is company.
7.--The SHERRY we drink ourselves, and the MARSALA we give
our friends at an evening party.
83–The Sweets we give our children, and the BITTERs we
receive from our husbands for so doing, on the absurd plea
that it makes the poor little dears ill.
9–The Soil we cultivate in our conservatories and out in our
balconies, and the . FlowRRs (hyacinths particularly) we
rear on our mantelpiece.
. 10–The Beverages we infuse, after an oyster supper, and the

ALL UP WITH ENGLAND.
(From the Journal de St. Petersbourg.)
INCERELY do we congratulate
N. Qur readers on the extreme
) distress and misery in which
A the English are involved by
tº reason of the impious war
which they have dared to
N. Wage against our august
| Lord and Master, Nicho-
IAs. We have the happi-
ºf ness to assure the subjects
| of His IMPERIAL MAJesty
that those wicked islanders
are in a state of absolute
starvation. . The price of
bread has increased to a
sum which places it beyond
the means of all classes but
the most opulent of the
nobility: and the scarcity
of all other provisions is
equally severe. Mutton-
chops are a sovereign
apiece, and thirty pounds
are demanded for a joint
of meat by the few butchers
who manage to keep their shops open. There is not a cat to be seen;
and everything would be eaten up by rats and mice if there were any:
thing for the mice and rats to eat; and if those vermin had not all
perished of famine, as many as have not been caught, and applied to
the same purpose as the cats. The dogs also have disappeared from
the streets, and even from the kennels of the º: thus foxes
can no longer be hunted for food, and there is not a basin of soup
to be had, or a sausage.
Owing to the imposition of the Malt, Tax, the MARQUIs, or West-
MINSTER and BARON ROTHSCHILD are the º persons in the country
besides the Queen and PRINCE ALBERT, who can afford beer: and
consequently all the cab-drivers and coalwhippers are in a state border-
ing on revolt. Whitebait and minnows are sixpence, each: whilst
aldermen, who this time last year were rolling in wealth, may now be
seen fighting in the City gutters for a bone. The few hides imported
have been entirely devoured; so that boots and shoes are not pro-
curable, and the population is going barefoot; The same statement
applies to tallow: insomuch that the nobility's balls are illuminated by
rushlights, and soda and potash being equally deficient, there is now
a terrible meaning in the popular inquiry, “How are you off for soap?”
Such is the want of hemp, that CALCRAFT, the executioner, is reduced
to the employment of hay-ropes, and the dearth of paper is so extreme
that not only can the boys fly no kites, but accommodation bills cannot
any longer § drawn, for lack of material. Nay, it has been found
impossible, for the same reason, to carry into effect the issue of bank;
notes, by which it was in contemplation to establish an artificial
currency: for paper in England is now more valuable than gold. It is
obvious that the expenses of this unhallowed contest cannot be sus-
tained much longer by the British infidels: in the meantime we .
reflect on the gratifying circumstance that they are subsisting on offal,

SLAUGHTER of THE BRITISH TRoops.”
A LADY'S CONSCIENCE AND A JUDGE'S DUTY.
At the Exeter Assizes a lady, acting on conscientious scruples,
refused to be sworn. The judge, MR. Justice WightMAN, hearing
that the lady objected to an oath under the impression that all oaths
are forbidden by a text of Scripture, referred her to the “Sheriff's
Chaplain,” who it seems is º: to “explain texts of Scripture,” a
process which sometimes ends in rendering obscure that which at first
appeared perfectly plain. The lady left the court to have an interview
with the professional remover of conscientious scruples, who had been
recommended by the judge, as a person calculated to overturn, by a
few minutes' conversation, the conviction of perhaps many years, and
to change into an easy oath-taker, an individual who had on º
refused to “swear at all.” The expected lubrication of the lady’s con-
science was however not accomplished, and the professional explainer
of texts did not succeed in that rapid overthrow of those objections to
an oath, of which he had been expected to make the very shortest
wºrk. The lady returned into court as firm as ever in her conscientious
refusal to be sworn; and the judge, telling her that “she would have
all the inconvenience but none of the merit of a martyr,” that “he
could not say he sympathised with her,” committed her to prison for
the remainder of the assizes, in the discharge of what he called his
“painful duty.”. If his Lordship had no sympathy we are at a loss to
know how his duty could have been painful to him, for unless he felt
H. for the object of his sentence, we do not see how he could have
een pained by anything but the mere labour-such as it was—of
uttering so many words. Both parties perhaps fulfilled their duty, but
in looking at the respective merits of the judge and the lady, there is
no difficulty in deciding which had the lº. duty to perform. We
think the judge might have spared his irrelevant observations, and he
might certainly have omitted his gratuitous declaration of want of
sympathy—a quality he had not been asked to manifest, though his
repudiation of it will do him as much harm in the opinion of thousands,
as the firmness under implied insult and real suffering will reflect
credit on the lady, whom his Lordship politely committed to the hands
of the jailer. - -
It is strange that it did not occur to the judge that if it was his duty
to act in obedience to the law of the land, it was a fortiori the duty of
the lady to pay obedience to that higher authority, under whose direc-
tion she was conscientiously acting. If this fact struck his mind, he
might have refrained from those sneers at the expense of her scruples,
with which he accompanied the sentence of imprisonment he thought
proper to enforce. -
#. whole transaction, as affording a fresh instance of the way in
which the law of the land and the moral law are brought into collision,
by the present system of oath-taking in judicial proceedings, may have
an effect that will prevent a repetition of such scenes as the one in
which the pledge acted—perhaps the principal, but certainly not the
highest—part.
SCOTTISH LIONS AT THREE PENCE.
(From the Caledonian Advertiser.)
The Season for Summer Excursions is now at hand, and doubtless |
the steps of numerous tourists, whether in search of health or recreation,
or both, will take the direction of the Land o' Cakes. Among the
many attractions which are
THE GLORY AND THE BOAST OF CALEDONIA,
not the least interesting is offered by
DRYBURGH ABBEY,
which, in addition to the historical associations connected with its
venerable, ruins, derives a peculiar charm from the circumstance of
being hallowed by enclosing within its precincts the cherished tomb
which contains all that was earthly of the far-famed
Wizard of the North.
It is unnecessary to state that by that title is intended, not our wonder-
working countryman, MR. ANDERson, who, we are happy to state, is
alive and well, but the magic minstrel, whose enchanting strains and
romances have won for himself and his country a world-wide eelebrity,
the talented author of “Waverley,”
SIR WALTER SCOTT.
As an object worthy the attention of the tourist, Dryburgh Abbey
has this peculiar advantage, that, considered in the light of a burial
place, and therefore as a locality suggestive of grave and solemn
meditations and trains of thought, it is one of those few scenes of a
recreative nature which are eligible for a Sunday visit, affording, as
it does, -
- “SERMONS IN STONES.”
-
on the transitory nature of even the most gifted existence, and other
subjects fraught with melancholy instruction.
For admission to the Abbey, including, the sight of SIR WALTER's
tomb, the enterprising lessee has reduced his demand to the small sum of
- Three Pence for Adults; Children Half Price.
No erra charge is made for the privilege of dropping a tear over departed
genus.
The Lessee of Dryburgh Abbey confidently trusts that the liberality
with which, whilst practically excluding the vulgar masses, he has thus
thrown almost open to the better orders a scene of so humanizing and
softening a tendency, especially to the young, as is presented by those
time-honoured and consecrated premises, will be met by the genteer
portion of the public in a corresponding spirit; and that there
“breathes not the man with soulso dead” as to refuse to the memory of
Scotl AND’s GREATEST AUTHOR,
a tribute so extremely reasonable as Six Bawbees.
TREATING PRUSSIA DIPLOMATICALLY.
. THE KING of PRussia, wishing to assist his imperial brother-in-law
in his difficulties, sent him an affectionate letter, in which he begged of
him not to have any reserve with him, but candidly to submit to him.
his case, and he wºuld promise faithfully, and without disguise to give
him his unbiassed opinion upon its merits. The EMPEROR, deeply
touched with this noble proof of friendship, sent his “dearly beloved
brother,” the case as he thought it exactly stood. It was carefully
gone through, and when the King had thoroughly made himself master
of its contents, he forwarded to St. Petersburg a report, in which he
said “he had scarcely made up his mind yet—it was certainly a most
difficult question—but as far as he had gone, he must say his opinion
was decidedly favourable—still it º to him that the case at
present was incomplete—so he would much rather not say anything
until he had seen the whole of it.” The fact is, the case submitted to the
Prussian Monarch was no other than a case of CLIcquot Champagne.
Rescue of Hampstead Heath.
WE are much obliged to the House of Commons for having thrown
out the Finchley Road Estate Bill. Thank Heaven we have a House
of Commons!. The Lords, with parks of their own to enjoy themselves
in, had no difficulty in passing an Act tending to deprive the public of
a playground....The Lower House has shown more sympathy with the
people, and will, we trust, make a stand against the further enclosure
of inds which are the Pººl. property: for, being Commons, they
must feel the force of the question. How would they like to be
enclosed themselves?

The United Happy Family—
Defying competition' ]
Composed of discordant creatures
In colour, and species, and age too,
Complexion, habits, and features, ,
And all in the same too !
Walk up! Walk up!
The Patriarch of the collection
Is this cuming old Scotch cat, here,
He has hardish strife for a quiet life,
What with owl and monkey and rathere.
But he stands aggrawation with meekness—
Though the º his temper tries, Sir;
Ob–serve the animal's sleekness,
And his habit of shutting his eyes, Sir,
Walk up; Waikuji
Next observe the performing monkey—
He’s a bad un—he is—to keep under;
He pulls the owls' tails, and the cat he assails—
ow the old boy stands it, I wonder.
PAM’s the monkey's name—up to all sorts o' game,
He keeps the whole cage in 'ot water;
But the coppers he draws and gets great applause,
And that’s what we looks arter.
Walk up ! Walk up!
Here's a pair of owls—werry wise-looking fowls,
Rayther given the young birds to cuffin’—
Much looked up to by all the family,
But that monkey—as don’t respect muffin.
One’s a Woburn bird—he's great, I’ve heard,
In constitutional histories:
Tº other’s Qxford-bred—and big as his head
May be, it’s chock-full of Church mysteries.
Walk up ! Walk up !
There's that mag-pie, but he’s a bad bargain, d'ye see,
I was told he was sich a talker:
But since here he come, the bird’s been dumb-
What they said of his jaw’s all Walker!
He was cotched, I’ve heard, in Adm'ralty yard;
But it’s time his neck was wrung, Sir:
For Iax, what’s the use, for fun or abuse,
Of a mag-pie without a tongue, Sir?
Walk up ! Walk up !
Here's a Netherby terrier—a wonderful worrier
Of vermin, I've heard, he used to be;
But now lives cheek by jowl with the cat and the owl,
And parted they can’t be induced to be.
That there teasin’ the cat’s the Australian rat,
Observe his white skin and pink peepers;
He’s a rum un to bite, and he’s day and night
At the owls, which they’re 'eavy sleepers.
Walk up! Walk up !
That there cockatoo, red-crested and blue
Was brought all the way from Argyle, Šir:
And alongside the same, is a cock, real game—
The Newcastle ginger-pile, Sir.
That Grey starling's been ailing, we thought he was failing,
But again, as before, his tongue pegs away;
We’ve a Cuckoo from Clarendon—aint he just an arrant un!
That’s him hiding between the cat’s legs away—
Walk up ! Walk up!
And there if the straw on one side you’ll draw,
Is the Southwark guinea-pig dozing:
Though smart when awake, his sleep’s hard to break,
And he's gin rally found reposing.
Another I put in the cage—such a strut
As he had, when he warn't a-snoring !
But the fam’ly one day found him so in the way,
He got shoved through a hole in the flooring.
Walk up! walk up !
So if pleased you have been with the sight that you’ve seen—
Recommend the Exhibition.
I’m sure you must own such a show was ne'er shown
At the same low charge for admission.
Birds and Beasts with each other live, as brother with brother,
Of encroachment or strife none complain e'er:
We’ve no rumpus—nor row—
[A tremendous caterwauling, barking, screaming, scuffling,
shrieking, and general outbreak of agonised and angry
animal noises heard within.
(Aside.) Hullow, what’s up now P
There’s the fam’ly a fightin’ again there !
[Erit Mr. Punch to settle the difficulty.
A WORD WITH MR. BALNES.
R. BAINEs.-In a letter
published as an ad- |.
vertisement in the
Times, , , you. . are
pleased to object to
the Crystal Palace
Company... opening
their Institution to
themselves on Sun-
day, and to people
going for recreation
to Kew Gardens on
the same *:
Now, therefore,
without intending to
affront you in the
least, I might ask,
who are you?
I believe the truth
is, MR. BAINEs, that
you, who set up to
teach us what we are
to do on Sunday, do
not yourself even go
to Church. Unless
I am much mistaken you are a Dissenter of some species, and attend
an Ebenezer, or Enon, or Little Bethel, or such like meeting-house.
Very well. Enjoy your dissent with all my heart. Dissent from me
toto calo, if you †. to carry your dissidence so far. But let us have
reciprocity. Spend your whole Sunday in Ebenezer if you will, but
allow me so far to differ from you as to F. part of mine, at least, in
Kew Gardens, or the Crystal Palace, if I please. - - - -
I respect EBENEzER. The word, I know, has a mystic signification.
It means, to me, freedom of conscience. But the time was when you,
Mr. B., would have been fined for attending that tabernacle instead of
ur parish church; nay, perhaps your ears would have ultimately
een cropped for your nonconformity., And certainly to sanction, by
the advocacy of sectarian prohibitions, the principle whereon, you would
have been subjected to that operation, is to exhibit a length of those
appendages . presents a strong case for **:
*. a Protestant and a Dissenter, myself. I dissent from the
Council of Trent, and I protest *. the supremacy of FERRETTI,
otherwise Pio Nono, Pope of me. Much more do I dissent
from your opinions in regard to Sunday, and protest that there
is no authority in them to control my actions... I say that you
neither have nor ought to have any spiritual jurisdiction in these
dominions. I also say that neither you nor any other of the
Sabbatarians can bring me one text out of the Book, which, we all
agree to be guided º: to prove that I am under any obligation
to keep Sunday as the Jews were ordered to keep Saturday, or forbid-
ding me to walk in gardens, or stroll about in a conservatory, or
inspect statues, or any other objects that are not vicious or impure.
further say that you and the rest of you have been thus challenged
over and over again, and will not answer the challenge; that you
ignore the argument which you are unable to refute; blink the truth
on which we stand against you; and persist in preaching your sermons
on a text that is not. - -
Do you really believe that the average mind–I will not say of a
mechanic or artisan—but of a master tailor or butcher, or grocer-of
the mass, in short, of the middle classes—is capable of really occupying
itself with spiritual meditations during all the hours of Sunday inter-
vening between the services, besides being attentive to these ? If not,
what %. the man better do than seek some innocent amusement? Go
to bed and to sleep, or sit twiddling his thumbs, or smoke a pipe, and
fuddle himself with spirit and water? That is the only spirituality,
Mr. BAINEs, that will be promoted by the tyranny of your
Sabbatarians; believe 3.3853C#.

-- THE MUSIC OF THE POLITICAL
SPHERES. -
SOMETHING LIKE SPORT.
Jolly Angler. “Hooray, Tom I've got on E—AND My word ' DIDN'T HE PULL "
On the proposition of SIR FitzRoy KELLY, a
clause has been inserted in the Bribery Bill to
prevent the employment of bands of music at
elections. This arrangement will be rather hard
on all the trumpets, trombones, and other “brazen
engines whose rude throats” have been hitherto
employed in ºf a sort of nominal har-
mony at a contested election. Wethink that all
the Green Baize Bands in the kingdom are entitled
to ask for compensation for the loss they will
sustain by this rather harsh enactment. A band
was a most useful appendage at a contested elec-
tion, for even the most short-winded of brazen
instruments was preferable to the long-winded
|and equally brazen of those who are in the habit
Él of making themselves the instruments of rival
candidates. A bad polka is always better than
a bad speech, and we would rather hear even
MENDELssohn murdered on the ophicleide than
LINDLEY MURRAY murdered on the hustings.
As the Bribery Bill is intended to prevent can-
didates from paying, as they have formerly done,
to a pretty tune, it is perhaps thought that
by doing away with bands, a stop will be put
to the practice of paying to any tune whatever. I
The Czar's Want of Scimitary.
The EMPEROR of Russia has shown the
cloven foot. It is greatly to be wished that he
would lead his own troops into action, as in that
case there would be some hope that he would
likewise show the cloven head. -
THE BELGRAVIAN MUSIC-MANIA. .
IN Belgravia there is, and has been for, some time, raging a frenzy
analogous in character to the remarkable mania resulting from the
bite of the tarantula spider. . It consists in a rabid propensity to sing,
as uncontrollable as the itch for dancing, wherewith the Neapolitans
are irritated by the venom of that insect.
This species of delirium, which is of a contagious nature, and also
somewhat corresponds with that of the “ Flagellants” of ecclesiastical
history, first manifested itself among the sect called Puseyites or
Tractarians, who abound in the district. It is said to have broken out
simultaneously in the Churches of St. Paul and St. Barnabas, which
are frequented principally by those enthusiasts, who, abandoning, under
its influence, the usage of rational persons, took to chanting their
prayers instead of saying them, and have now arrived at such a pitch
of absurdity, as not only to sing, but against all sober and sensible
advice, to persist in singing the Litany. It is not to be expected that
the disorder will stop here: indeed there can be little doubt that the
St. Paul's and St. Barnabas' congregations will very soon, if not next
i. insist on having the Sermon sung, instead of being preached
to them.
Demeaning themselves with so much extravagance in Church, it will
correctly be surmised that these music-mad people proceed to still
greater excesses in social intercourse..., They are reported to, sing
responses to inquiries about their health, which they also put to
one another in singing, and to converse concerning the weather and
the war in recitative. Their table-talk is likewise all carried on in
music; so that their dinner parties, and other réunions, as the fashion-
able phrase runs, are so many harmonic meetings: and very wonderful
it, is, to see the higher phases of society thus, approximate to those
which are presented at Cider-cellars and Coal-holes. They make love in
song, as characters do at the Opera; they debate likewise in tune,:
º their differences with their neighbours have created much
discord in their parish. Their commands addressed, to their footmen
and other servants are all melodious, and they literally sing out when
they want their coachmen to stop.
If ever Belgravia should obtain a 'member to represent it in the
Commons, and a Puseyite, should be returned by the Constituents,
there is no doubt that the honourable gentleman will have a voice in
the House which he will exert in arias and bravuras. At a Public
Meeting recently held for the purpose of securing a choral litany, the
Belgravians are understood to have sung those observations which in
general constitute a plain speech.
A RUSSIAN PROBLEM SOLVED.
N common, we suppose, with
most civilised beings, we
have long been puzzled to
understand why the Rus-
sians, perhaps more than
any other nation, have such
animordinate tastefortallow
—we mean not as an article
of light but of diet. From
our earliest cradlehood the
º: of a Russian has
een drawn in oils upon our
mentalcanvas: and we have
pictured him to ourselves
as a hairy individual, holding
tº with one hand a bunch of
candles to his lips, like the
boy with the grapes in Mu- |
RILLo's picture, while his
other hand rests upon a can
of lamp oil, wherewith to
wash down the tallowy tit-
bits. We have also heard
recounted wild legends by
our fathers of how, when
the Russian fleet once º
at Spithead (as we rather think it possible it may again, shortly, wit
the Black Eagle flying beneath the British Ensign), the streets of
Portsmouth were nightly put in darkness by unenlightened Russians,
who sucked out the lamps as fast as they were lit. In fact we have
always been led to believe that however strong an attachment the
Russian may profess for his country, he is still continually betraying a
*
preference for Greece, -
here is proverbially no accounting for tastes, and there has been
until lately no accounting for this. Time, however, and the Invalide
Russe have together helped to solve the mystery. From the official
reports which that, veracious print has published concerning the
bombardment of Qdessa, and other so-claimed Russian victories, it
seems to us quite clear that every Russian subject finds it necessary to
his existence to keep his throat well greased, in order to prevent his
being choked by the enormous lies which his Governåſent is constantly
obliging him to swallow.

i. POLITICAL FASHIONS IN SPAIN.
The QUEEN of SPAIN promises, in her recent
proclamation, “a new era of true liberty, morality,
and justice.” There can be no doubt that if
“liberty, morality, and justice” are really in-
troduced into the Government of Spain, they
will be amongst the greatest “novelties of the
season.” We should recommend the inscrip-
tion of the words Magasin des Nouveautés over
all the Government offices. We shall be curious
to see the new patterns of morality that are to
proceed from º palace of Madrid, where the
modes have hitherto been such as would
any decent millimer's establishment.
m the way of Liberty we may expect some
rather curious devices, and we are very much
afraid that the material will be of too flimsy a
description for the wear and tear to which it will
be liable. It is something new indeed to see
Madrid setting the fashions to Paris, but if
anything in the way of Liberty is to come, into
vogue, the Spanish capital will be decidedly in
advance of the i. metropolis. We fear,
however, that poor Liberty will soon have her
figure spoiled, and her free respiration impeded
by the tight lacing which is too much in fashion
with some of the Continental Governments.

FINE, ART IN POETS’ CORNER.
WESTMINstER Abbey is often spoken of as a fine building, and very
properly so, whether you consider the word fine as a substantive or an
adjective. The Dean and Chapter who preside over that venerable
pile possess the power of º a fine for the erection of any statue
or other monument within its walls, so that the Abbey may be described
as a fine-edifice, containing fine-statues. This P. they are said to be
at present exercising, by demanding the sum of 200 guineas for the per-
mission to erect the monument of CAMPBELL in Poets' Corner. The
monument is stated to have been completed several years, and to be
imprisoned in the artist's studio, or elsewhere, only because the fine is
not paid. If, as is also alleged, the DEAN and Čºpter of Westmin.
sTER have already had a fine, and a heavy one, out of the Poet's grave
they might consider whether the fine-feeling which they have evince
towards departed genius should not give place to a finer.
It seems to be the object of these fine fellows to make hay infine
weather, and certainly such weather may not be permitted to last. That
BUCKLAND and MILMAN are fine names we all know, but how fine they
are was known to comparatively not many. A general dislike is felt for
ecclesiastical finery, but that is nothing to the odium which the
authorities of Westminster Abbey will incur by their style of “coming
it fine.” Not to put too fine a point on it, we would recommend them
to confine, their exactions, lest the fine thing they make out of West-
minster Abbey should be confined for them, within a small compass,
one of these fine mornings.

TIPPERARY ROASTING PIG.
THE little pigs of some town, blest with ex-
traordinary prosperity, are described in an irish
anecdote as running about the streets roasted
and smoking hot, º the public at large to
come and eat them. When MR. CARDEN was
acquitted, the other day, on his second trial for
attempted abduction, the ladies are said to have
cheered him and waved their handkerchiefs.
Perhaps this was, because of their persuasion
of his innocence; but if it was owing to a belief
in his guilt, the sympathy manifested by these
ladies is a hint that may be worth taking if there
is among them a handsome heiress, or an heiress
worth anything handsome. In that case, also,
there can be no doubt, that the town of voluntary

ladies of Tipperary are those little pigs.

Her M. My lords, I have been reading the speech which you were so
good as to prepare for me at the opening of the present session, because
it appears to me that the address at its close should refer to the hopes
and promises with which we set out...Does not that seem reasonable?
Lord J. R. Without venturing to discuss the reasonableness of such
a course, your M-Y, I would observe that it is not precisely exacted
by the Constitution, and inasmuch as there are occasions when such
references might be productive of unhappy cavil, we can be guided by
the exigency of the moment.

Lord J. R. tº: That won’t do. There is our Declaration

Lord J. R. Except that we have done the Bishop of NEw ZEALAND

new mode of national bookkeeping.
Her M. I do not see how the mode of stating an account can alter
the account itself. We must pass over this... I mentioned that the
year before we had not had a good harvest. This year, providentially,
the harvest will be a rich one.
Lord J. R. It will sadly offend the friends of the farmers to be told
that they have nothing to grumble at, but I think we should risk that.
Her M. I said that trade was prosperous. - -
Lord J. R. The war impedes commercial enterprise by causing hesi-
tation and uncertainty, but things are not very bad—yet. If the war
were yigorously pushed towards a speedy termination, we should
scarcely feel the mischief. -
Lord A. I protest against mixing matters which have nothing to do
with one another.
Her M. I referred to University Reform.
Lord A. (looking triumphantly at his colleague). Your M-Y’s late
Ministers have passed a very good bill on this subject. My noble friend
was beaten about twenty times during the debates, and the bill was
remodelled by the enemy. Would it be constitutional, LoRD J-N
R—L, for HER M-Y’s Government to compliment HER M-Y’s
Opposition ?
Her M. I said that bills would be submitted to Parliament for trans-
ferring from the Ecclesiastical to the Civil Courts the cognizancé of
testamentary and matrimonial causes. In other words, we promised
reform in the law of Wills, and of Divorce.
Lord J. R. Excuse me, your M-Y. We said that bills should be
submitted. They were. We promised to do nothing more, and have
kept our promise. Both bills have been withdrawn.
Her M. We promised a reform in the Civil Service system. .
Lord J. R. I fear we must ask your M-Y to promise it again, and
next year we will see about it.
Her M. We promised to reform the law of Pauper Settlement. .
d: J. R. The country squires did not like our bill, so we with-
ew it.
Her M. I said that measures would be submitted for the amendment
of the laws relating to the representation of the Commons in Parliament.
Lord J. R. “Infandum, Regina, jubes renovare dolorem.” (Bursts
into tears, to the great grief of H. 7. H. Pi—ss.)
Her M. My lord, you fulfilled your pledge. Let the disgrace lie with
those who hindered your doing more, and specially, with Manchester,
which, rather than see reforms achieved otherwise than at its own dic-
tation, rejected them. The Free-Traders, false to their º:

“There's no complaint of you, my little man.”
Then I º ised a Bill against Bribery. -
Lord J. R. We have done something, but this bill also has been
remodelled by the Tories, and its best parts are cut out.

CRUEL TREATMENT OF A RESPECTABLE PERSON.
To Mr. Punch.
cº SIR, -
“THERE is much said about the humanity displayed nowadays
in war. Enemies are treated with the most friendly consideration, and
. armies proceed to the cutting of one another's throats, and
the blowing out of one another's brains, with the most exquisite
politeness.
“How comes it, that in our catalogue of things deserving of con:
sideration in war-time, we have not, included “respectable persons?”
* Respectable persons,’ as the name implies, are eminently persons to
be treated with respect. This holds of all respectable persons; but
how much more does it apply where º: persons are also
officialsº I have read, with equal pain, and surprise, in the Times of
August 1st, in a letter from Baro Sound, how—
“‘CAPTAIN Sullivan, being on shore to day, has captured a very RespecTABLE
PERson IN A GREEN coat, with BRAss Buttons. He says that he is the SHERIFF
of the Panish, and a Consul.'
“In other accounts of the same incident I find this respected person
variously described as "a policeman,’ ‘a general ºfficer,’ ‘a beadle,” “a
dignitary of the church,' and “a high-baili º
“Conceive the feelings of a British beadle, who having gone down to
Ramsgate for the benefit of sea-air, should find his walk to Pegwell
Bay suddenly cut short by the appearance of a boat's crew of Russian
privateersmen, and jºi. hat, official coat, staff and all-car-
ried off to St. Petersburg, and exhibited to the jeers of a brutal popu-
lace, ever glad to insult dignity in distress—perhaps to the taunts
of the Russian little boys—a class at all times difficult to impress with
awe. Nay, the stern and solitary policeman of Herne Bay, or the
gallant though stout_artilleryman, who constitutes the garrison, of
Brighton, is not safe, from this moment, if reprisals should be attempted
by the enemy. Realty, to read the paragraph, one would think
“respectable persons’ were a kind of birds, to be bagged at pleasure—
and green coats with brass buttons, a plumage to be described by the
naturalist. This respectable individual probably imagined that his
green coat and brass buttons rendered his person sacred. Perhaps he
was digesting a sober meal-perhaps protecting a peaceful population,
like the policeman of Herne Bay, or the Brighton artilleryman to whom
I have referred. -

HOW TO BEAT THE RUSSIANS.
“Warna, Aug. 10.
tº HE following spirited address
to the British Army servin
in the East has been issue
om Head Quarters:—
“Soldiers 1—In the con-
flict which you are about to
sustain with the forces of
the greatest military power
of Europe in point of num-
bers, your QUEEN and
country trust you will never
: desert your colours, by
3 wearing any that are con-
trary to regulation.
º “Whether in the face of
3 the enemy, or encamped
3 side by side with your allies,
our officers will never un-
utton their shell jackets,
and allow them to fly open
showing underneath a re
flannel shirt. The bosom
of the British Officer, his
jacket buttoned bravely over
it up to the chin, will never
betray the shirt to friend or
foe. He will set his men the example of wearing a white collar and a
black stock. He will avoid all plaids that are not strictly regimental,
and leave checks to be experienced by the Russians. He will never
put on a turban over his forage cap under the hottest fire of the sun;
and having been commanded to draw the sword, he will know how to
wear it.
“In facing the enemy you will show that face which has always been
shown by the British soldier. That is, you will display as much of it
as possible; you will, with the regulated exceptions, remove all hair
from your upper lips, and shaye your chins. - -
“You #. on your uniforms with that care and attention which
will enable you successfully to resist the heaviest odds and the most
vigorous charge, as well as to prove more than a match for the most
crafty stratagems of your antagonists. -
“You will pipeclay your belts and epaulettes with that perseverance
which has always distinguished English troops in the field; and you
will strap yourselves in the manner that becomes tight lads;, so that
while you strike terror into the hostile ranks, it may not at the same
time happen that they cannot be otherwise than struck by your general
.."of what is proper.

LEGAL DESTITUTION.
SINCE Taverns and Coffee-Houses in the City write up “No Fees
given to the Waiters,” MEssRs. BRIEFLESs and DUNUP declare that,
considering the little practice there is at the Bar, a somewhat similar
placard might, in better truth be hung up over all the Law Courts,

THE DOG-DAYS AT THE BLUECOAT SCHOOL.
THE late hot weather has been peculiarly trying to the dogs and the
Bluecoat Boys of the City of London, but though precautions against
hydrophobia were adopted, no measures were taken to prevent the boys
from going mad. This remark is addressed to the Governors of Christ's
Hospital, who will require no apology for mentioning the scholars of
their institution along with dogs. Are not those scholars objects of
charity, and, as such, entitled to no more consideration than so many
whelps ? However, it cannot be denied that they deserve, as much.
Now, dogs have been emancipated from the servitude of the coster-
monger, and must no ". be employed in drawing trucks. . Certainly
it does not follow that Bluecoat Boys should be released from their
tasks. No; but Greek and Latin are diaphoretic work at any time, as
a city alderman might ascertain if he would try the declension of Musa,
or endeavour to master 6, #, rb. If he attempted such exertion on a
moderately warm day, his worship would certainly find it necessary to
take off his gown. Can it therefore be right that a poor lad should be
compelled to fag at SALLUST, VIRGIL, LIvy, CICERO, XENOPHON,
THUCYDIDEs, How ER, AEscHYLUs, and EURIPIDEs, in a frying atmo.
i. and under a weight of woollen clothes? This is really treatin
the boy worse than a dog, and those who subject the former to ...;
treatment in hot weather had better muzzle him like the latter, for the
recipient of charity under such conditions might naturally be expected
to bite the hand that feeds it.
“Is the costume of EDward THE SIXTH a fit dress for the school-
boys of 1854?” demands “M.D.” in a letter to the Times on this
subject; and he correctly describes that costume as consisting of a
heavy blue woollen robe, yellow petticoat of the same material, cap
also woollen, of the size of a pen-wiper, yellow worsted stockings and
shoes. In answer to D.'s inquiry, it may be said that of all the
above-named articles of apparel, there are none that are fit for the
schoolboys of 1854, except perhaps the last in the list. Perhaps except
these, for the case may be that it is no longer customary for the scholars
of Christ's Hospital to scramble for their shoes thrown together in a
heap after having been cleaned, and perhaps they have thus ceased to
be misfitted with shoes and to get lamed in consequence.
The cap, indeed, of the Bluecoat Boy can be worn, but only in the
ocket; so that the head has no clothing at all. The uncovered head
ºi. humility, which, the Governors of the Hospital may, think
desirable, but they cannot be of opinion that it is also a good thing to
expose a boy to a coup de soleil.
Surely the climate of the country must have changed; for a dress
which may have suited the days of Edward THE SIXTH, is not adapted
to the days—at least the dog-days—of Victoria. The First. The only
argument that can be urged in behalf of it—and mark how canine asso-
ciations cling about the theme—is derived from what is likewise said to
constitute the beauty of a bull-dog, its ugliness. It makes the wearer
look extremely ridiculous, and it therefore keeps the children of the
higher classes out of the school. The same object might, as M. D.
justly observes, be ºned by the substitution of a costume equally absurd
but more comfortable. It might also be secured by the simple method
of the Governors faithfully discharging their trust. -
But if Charity must have its Objects—that is to say its Frights—
the Aldermen and their colleagues might clothe the boys in colours as
preposterous as those of the LoRD MAYoR's coach, and yet in caps,
jackets, and trowsers of ordinary make: such as a boy might play
about in. The material might be motley if they chose, but would not
something simply mean and common suffice? would not fustian and
corduroy answer every purpose? ... Some sort of charity-dress may be
considered requisite for charity children: but the Bluecoat School id:
is decidedly the dress of a much too “melting Charity.”
Our Account with Russia.
We don’t know what to say about paying debts to Russia. Honour
among thieves is an acknowledged maxim; but the recognition of
social obligations towards them depends upon circumstances. The
property of a convicted felon is forfeit to the Crown. Government
would not pay dividends to JACK SHEPPARD under sentence; and why,
it may be asked, should we stand upon more ceremony with the Burglar
and Outlaw of Europe? All we can say is that we owe Nicholas a
hiding, and ought to try our utmost to pay him that.
DUSTING. The WRONG JACKET.
THERE is a great fuss about the costume of the army. We only
wish our commanders would attend a trifle less to the dressing of the
English, and trouble themselves a little more about giving the Russians
a good dressing.
OUR CyNICAL CONTRIBUTOR sends us this:-There is a Blue
Beard's Chamber in every man's heart, of which he does not like to
trust the keys to any one, not even to his own wife.—(Rubbish. ED.)

GENERAL SIR GEORGE BROWN DETERMINES TO
- INSPECT SEBASTOPOL.
-
PUNCH'S HANDBOOKS TO THE CRYSTAL
PALACE.
THE GREEK COURT.
Thought MR. Owen Jones has thought it necessary to offer an
Apology (price sixpence) for colouring the Greek Court, we shall offer
no apology whatever for painting the Greek Court in our own peculiar
colours. Without pausing to consider whether MINERyA should be
treated to a pair of blue º or whether the hair of VENUsshould
be dyed, we shall dash awa black and white, combining all the
vigour of the six-pound brush with the delicacy, of the finest pencil,
made of the silkiest hair of the sleekest and best groomed camel.
Greece, as anybody knows, is next door to Egypt, and within, we were
f. to say, a stone's throw, but we feel that those who enter glass
ones should not be throwing stones as a mode of measurement. .
The Greek Court is approached by a façade, having three Grecian
doorways of the Grecian Doric Order. The visitor is, or may be,
arrested at the principal entrance by what to the inexperienced eye
would appear to be some rather strange characters; but the learned
will recognise these characters as constituting a º from
HERoborus. The unlearned will at once enter the Court without
going through the passage, which, if it is unfortunately above their
comprehension, is luckily so much above their heads that they can pass
immediately under it. - - - -
There is over each of the three entrances an inscription of the merest
common-place, and they are so far appropriate to a doorway, which is a
very common place to have an inscription over it.
ving nearly lost ourselves in admiration of the façade, we find
ourselves rapidly in the Central Greek Court, which represents an agora
or market-place. The names around are those of poets, philosophers,
and artists, but considering the place is a market, the most appropriate
names would have been those of butchers, greengrocers, and fish;
mongers. The list begins with Honºr, who may perhaps headmitted
into a market by virtue of the accuracy of his measures. Hippoch ATES
the father of physic (a, most disgusting relationship by the way, which
must have prevented the father from meeting his physical progeny with
a pleasant face), may have been introduced as the first man who made
abusiness of medicine, and who may have realised the commercial idea
of “a drug in the market.” "While Hoº has arrived on his Pegasus,
Anchºnfedes may be said to have come down to posterity on his cele-
brated Screw, and his name is by no means ill-suited to a market-place,
where he might have had a stall, not only for his screw but for those
celebrated burning-glasses which were the result of his own deep
reflection.
The Paintings on the wall of the Greek Court would seem to be
rdly suited to a market, though the subject of the Judgment of Paris
— —
is perhaps admissible, where the golden pippin may be offered for sale,
and, the fall ºf Trºy may be allowed to pass, under the somewhat
strained idea that Troy weight might be kept in view by the heaviness
of the catastrophe. A third painting represents the Infernal Regions,
in which the tormented are seen listening to the playing of ORPHEUs,
who must be playing dreadfully out of tune to account for the horror
depicted in the countenances of the listenºrs, . The subject of the
fourth painting is Phidias erhiliſing his Model ºf Minerra, or in other
words acting as a showman of his own productions. it has been
thought a happy idea to place this picture at the supposed entrance of
the workshop of Phip. As, as if the ancient sculptor had hoisted a sign,
which should be equivalent to a cry of “Walk up” essed to the
people in the market place.
W. now enter the Atrium, which contains a model of the West End
of the Parthenon. The building of the Parthenon is said to have eost
one thousand talents, though its highest value is represented in the
single talent of the architect. The Temple was built in honour of
MINERVA, who was supposed to live in the cella, where her statue
was deposited.
The whole of the ornaments of the building are supposed to repre-
sent scenes in the life of MINEnva, the mistress of the mansion, who,
with all her ancient wisdom, seems not to have risen above the modern
º # filling her own abode with pictures of herself and of her own
exololts.
|. Parthenon was in a comparatively perfect state until 1687, when
the Venetians besieged Athens, and threw in a shell which destroyed
nearly all but the shell of the building. The Parthenon was on the top of
the Acropolis, and occupied what Dr. Woºdsworth called the “fliest
site in Europe;” a distinction that has been sometimes claimed for
Trafalgar Square, where an almost unlimited sight of money has been
employed in rendering the finest site in Europe remarkable for its ex-
treme unsightliness. The frieze forms a striking portion of the building,
and ºn attempt has been made to give warmth to the frieze by painting
it. is proceeding has been the subject of much discussion, it being
argued on one side that the frieze cannot be too cold in order to be
correct; and it being contended on the other side, that those who would
paint the frieze have a colourable excuse for coming to that conclusion.
The result is that the advocates of the paint-pot have prevailed
though many artists allege that the colour should not have been applie
till #. subject had been thoroughly canvassed. It would be a tedious
task to trace the progress of sculpture from the primitive efforts of the
wood-cutter, who hacked the human form into a shape resembling the
doll of our own days, until the skill of the sculptor reached the
culminating point in the genius and chisel of PHIDIAs. This great
artist literally played with the marbles that came into his hand, and he
died in the middle of a game, for he did not live to complete his colossal
statue of MINERVA, which was so lofty that it must have taken half the
sculptor's time to travel from the top to the toe, or even to find his way
|''. the bridge of the nose, iſ he happened to be making for the
Temple.
APPEARANCE OF THE POLICE.
Writing in reference to the Police, asks a Correspondent of the
| Times:– -
“Would it not be advisable to give them a short frock in lieu of the absurd swallow-
tail, which has neither appearance nor comfort, and by that means afford men who are
exposed to all weathers, at all hours, some protection to their loins, stomachs, and
hips, as well as adding grace and manliness to their appearance, neither of which
the present coat does?”
It is no doubt very desirable that the Police should be clad in gar-
ments which would afford sufficient protection to their loins, stomachs,
and hips, but there is a serious objection to dressing them in any
manner calculated to add grace and manliness to their appearance.
|Most householders will be of opinion that the personal appearance of
the Police is quite graceful and manly enough as it is; and that it
would be very much the reverse of an advantage to families to make
any addition whºſever to those attractions which Poligºmen, attired in
º present uniforms, present to cooks and housemaids at our area-
rallings.

Faint and fainter came the tittering,
And the rustling and the twittering
Of caged lady-birds behind;
Faint the Speaker’s “Order! order!”
As, too loud, a Member snored, or
Cried “Hear!”—not to hear inclined.
All things swam and danced around me,
Till the chains of slumber bound me,
And in Dream-land I was blest—
(Far from Parliament'ry pothering,
And the gallery gaslight's smothering)–
Where sub-editors lave bothering,
And reporthers are at rest.
And I pondthered, and I pondthered,
As through Dream-land on I wandthered—
Wandthered without pause or check;
Till, looking up, of walking weary,
I found me in a desert dreary,
Strewn with rubbish and with wreck.

SERVANT AND BAGGAGE OF THE
BRITISH OFFICER IN THE EAST.
[From an authentic Sketch in the possession of Mr. Punch.
REAL STEAM ENGINEERS.
We have good reason for announcing that a very great extension of
the powers of steam will shortly be made on the North-Western
way. In a letter addressed to the public through the medium of
the Times, “AN ENGINEMAN’’ makes the statement following:—
“Under the present system of working the engines, it can be proved that men are
fast asleep on their engines while on the road, and in charge of a train consisting of
between fifty and sixty waggons. As a proof of the foregoing statement, I have only
to add, that one engineman came on duty on Friday, the 28th of July last, at seven
o'clock in the evening; he was piloting till half-past two in the morning; he was then
sent from Rugby to Rockingham and back, a distance of fifty-four miles. He was
then sent to London and back, a distance of 163 miles, thereby commencing duty at
7 P.M. on Friday, and finishing at 1 A.M. on Sunday, making the total number of
hours on duty thirty; out of which he had not time to obtain the least refreshment,
except as he was riding upon his engine."
The signatures of four individuals, who give their names, are
appended to the above document, on which therefore reliance may
W. be placed. If enginemen are overworked on the North-
Western Railway to the extent described by the writer, of course they
must go to sleep, supposing their frames to be constituted of ordinary
flesh and blood. It is almost unnecessary to remark that a map of
ſorty winks on the part of an engineman might involve the whole of
the passengers in an interminable slumber. But if dividends demand
economy, and economy necessitates the employment of one man to do
the work of six, the only thing to be done for º: safety is to get a
man with a frame that will stand the fatigue. He must, in short, have
an iron constitution; and therefore the I)irectors of the North.
Western will consult both their duty and, their interest in providing
themselves with Enginemen who may truly be described as Iron men.
Accordingly their Enginemen for the future will be men made of Iron;
their limbs, their joints, their brains, in so far as they require brains for
the performance of their duties, being all composed of that metal.
Hearts they will have no need for, or these might be formed of the
same material, as some may imagine that those of the Directors who
will employ them are...They will be men of wheels and cogs, oſhinges
and screws; more particularly men of screws, we may say, considering
who will be their masters. Their bodies, thus consisting of an iron
mechanism, will be animated by steam; they will, in fact, be engines
constructed to direct other engines: and that this is impossible who
shall say, knowing that an automaton has been made to play chess *. In
them will be realised the idea of Steam finginemen—a motion which
has never yet been carried out. ... The North Western Company will
find in them the . servants it wants, servants who will need no
sleep. To eat, indeed, they will require somewhat: but will want only
a little coal and water, which being placed within their reach, perhaps
they will be enabled by the ingenuity of their contriver to help them-
selves, and be their own stokers. They will never turn out for any
increase of wages, or strike, except in case of a reduction of the allow-
ance of oil that will be requisite to keep them going, and even then
will create no disturbance, nor murmur or grumble, but only run a
little rusty. It will be impossible that they should ever get tipsy; as,
though they may smoke, they will drink nothing but water; or that
they should be guilty of carelessness or negligence; and if they should
ever exhibit a fatal want of foresight, a verdict of manslaughter will be
returnable against their employers. -

Call a Spade a Spade.
With a warmth of indignation which is exactly suitable to this hot
weather, the Times calls especial attention to the fact of a Russian
frigate having eluded the blockading squadron off Sebastopol, and
carried off some prizes from almost underneath the British Admiral’s
nose. We are not in the habit of employing personalities, but we have
certainly a prejudice in favour of calling things by their right names;
and if such a slip as this should occur again, we shall be strongly
tempted, when we speak of ADMIRAL DUNDAs in future, to call him not
Admiral of the Fleet, but of the Slow.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A RATIONAL CONCLUSION.
F anything were wanting to account
for the insane actions of the present
Government, and to confirm our own
too just suspicions of the lamentable
cause, the deficiency is now supplied by
the following public announcement in
the Times of the 2nd instant:
“DR. Forters WINslow had an interview with
Lond ABERDEEx yesterday.”
fºnt on the mournful intelli-
gence"Conveyed by this short paragraph
would be superfluous, and we can o
congratulate our readers that the ne-
cessary step, however late, has at last
been taken. It is at least some conso-
lation tº know that, if the indisposition
of the Premier is not to relieve us en-
tirely from his counsels, he is being
attended, by so eminent a man as Dr.
WINslow; and most sincerely do we
wish him success in restoring sanity to
the Cabinet, but we fear it is a %.
case, having been so long
TRIcks of THE ELECTRICS.
IN a capital article on the Electric Telegraph, the Quarterly Review
expresses a decided opinion, in which Mr. Punch as decidedly concurs,
that the instrument has yet to come into géneral use, and that the
existing system is a non-conductor to the wires. -
As far as Mr. Punch can see, the chief object:of the officials entrusted
with the telegraphs is to discourage the transmission of messages. The
plan is to make as much fuss as possible, and to insist upon the obser-
vance of details with the same pedantic precision as if a request to
your wife at Brighton to secure a bed for SMITH, who is coming down
with you, was to be registered amid the archives of the nation. Then
the niggardly, petty-tradesman-like way in which an extra word is made
the excuse, for an extra demand of money, gives a meanness to the
whole affair. Add, that the prices are already far too high, and
that, generally speaking, the manners of the electric shopmen impress
you with their conviction that they are really doing you a great favour
in selling you a pint of electric fluid, though, really the barman who
pulls at his ivory handle and draws you his fluid (when you refresh
.# between the acts of Norma) is just as much entitled to give
imself airs of importance. - -
MR. BRowN meets MR. Jon Es, salutes him by the title of old fellow,
and also characterises him as a pretty fellow. Jones demands the
meaning of the ironical compliment. BROWN, with Anglo-Saxon frank-
ness, explains that both he and MRs. BRowN are perfectly savage with
MR. Jones for never coming near them. Jon Es, desirous to abate
their fury, asks when they will be at home and give a fellow a knife and
fork. BROWN says there is no time like the present—he is at Dartford
in Kent, with MRs. B. If Jones will go down with him by the 5:30
train, they will give him dinner, a cigar, and a bed, and they can come
up together in the morning. Jones assents, and goes off in a
to pack his carpet bag, BROWN remarking that he will let the missis
know. For Mits. BRowN, though the kindest, smilingest, little thing
in the world, has a matronly liking for knowing when an addition is to
be made to her dinner-table, and Mr. Punch would not give twopence
for any wife who has not, or for any husband who does not—if he
can—gratify that liking.
Plungeth MR. BRowN through the swinging gin-palace doors of the
electric fluid shop, and going up to one of the pawnbrokerly boxes, tears iſ
down a form, and writes:--
Loving ToDDLUMS,-OLD CHARLEY Jones Is coming Down witH ME
To DINE AND SLEEP. SALMON, IF You CAN. IcE.—You RAFFEC-
TIONATE DODDLEKINs.
“There,” says MR, BRow N, “send that to Dartford. How much Pº
The shopman takes the paper without a word, and reads it over. M.R.
BRowN suddenly recollects that the familiar epithets of his note were
not exactly intended to be reviewed by an uninterested clerk, and he
feels rather absurd.
“Put in your name and address, and the name and address of the
person to whom the message is to be sent.”
MR. BRow N, obeys the command, and writes “Joseph BRow N, 13,
Lauristina Willas, Clapton.”
“That won't do,” dictates the other. “Put figures in words. Can't
you read the directions P”
“Blessed nonsense !” mutters MR. BROwn; but he writes “thir.
Hansom
teen,” and his wife's address at Dartford. The young gentleman
behind the counter begins to count the words.
“Seven shillings.”
“Seven shillings!” echoes MR. BRowN, remembering that this sum
would pay for the salmon and the ice, and leave something in hand.
“How do you make that out? I thought you charged half-a-crown a
message; and that is eighteenpence too much.”
“Half-a-crown for twenty words,” explains the clerk.
“Oh!—Ah!—Well, give us hold. §. I have only made twenty;
two., Let's knock out 'old'—he isn't old, for that matter. And we'll
knock out “if you can ;’ she won’t get it if she can’t, that's certain.
re now, there are only eighteen words.”
*Eighteenſ” echoes the clerk. “There are thirty-two.”
...What, do you charge for the address;"
*Can't go without an address, can it?”
“Well, no; but it's precious shabby. But
wantºny address-my wife's is all that's needful.
“The rule is that you give both.”
*But the addresses make thirteen words out of the twenty.”
-: make fifteen.” And he counts the words to MR. BRowN.
“Why, you are counting the printed words “To’ and “From. They
don't gº into the message; they are only directions to yourselves, in-
serted for your own convenience.”
ge º: are our rules, Sir. You need not send the message unless
you like.”
“I am aware of that, young man,” says MR. BROWN, who has...an
º distaste for being bullied at a bureau. “But I do like,
and I shall cut it down to twenty words.”
:Cut away,” says the clerk, walking off.
“Five words. Well, I am bless'd ſ” says BRowN, but we’ll do it.
Out with loving ToDDLUMs, she knows } know she's loving. Out
with old, as I said. ... Out with CHARLEy, she knows which Jongs I’d

never think of ice. Stop, I have it. Out with her affectionate

there’s your half-crown.

“JoNEs To DINNER. SALMON, ICE.”
“Fifteen the address, that makes twenty. Four and Sixpence.” . .
“What—after all the cuttings? What the deuce do you mean?”
says BRowN, waxing wrath.
... Porterage, a shilling.”
“Why, it's only five minutes walk from the railway. And you
ought to deliver the message you undertake to deliver.”.
“That is the charge.”
“And what’s the other shilling?”
“Why, you see, our line does not run into that one exactly, so the
other line make a charge at the break.”
“By Jove,” says MR. BRow N, furiously crumpling up his manuscript
“sooner than submit to your extortion, Jones shall take his chance o
potluck.”. And he strides through the gin-palace doors in a rage.
It must be satisfactory to a º nt mind to be informed that
dear, little MRs. BRowN was not at all put out, but having been
watching with a telescope for the stoppage of the train at Dartford,
made out MR. JoNES, and long before he and BR.own came up, she
had secured the last piece of salmon which GRHse the fishmonger had
got, and also sixpennyworth of ice, and was ready with her smiles as
they turned the corner. But no thanks to the Electric Telegraph,

THE PERPETUAL YOUTH OF THE WOMEN OF ENGLAND.
IT appears from the Census, that the people of Great Britain are the
youngest people in the world. We are not surprised at this result, and
indeed we only wonder that there is any woman in England above the
age of thirty, which we are convinced would have been impossible, had
the ladies been left to make their own returns... We have had a striking
proof of the numerical strength of the Young England party, to which
it seems that nearly the whole of the fair sex belongs. There is such a
tendency to youth in our female population that we find them ranging
themselves under the different heads of “children,” “girls,” “infants,”
“maidens,” and “young women,” as, if juvenility were a luxury to
be enjoyed under as many different denominations as possible. "We
verily believe that if the women had their own way, they would never
adopt the epithet “old,” should they even live ſº be a hundred, and
that they would class themselves in the category of “second childhood.”
rather than admit their arrival at the stage of anility. Such is the
female horror of the vale of years, that a woman would sooner declare
herself to be in her dot-age, than to have reached that “certain age”
which any figure above thirty is supposed to indicate. ,

A WOICE FROM STOKE POGIS.
STORE PoGIs has long been a name familiar to our ears, but we
should as soon have expected to hear of any one having extracted a
int of Peº sºup from a paving stone as of any one having victimised
Stoke Pogis by a misappropriation of the funds of its charities. We
always regarded the Stoke Pogians as a § and simpleº rich in
not but their parish pump, their public pound, and their private
yirtues. It seems, however, that sº. Pog's possesses a charity
known as foºd Hºspinus's Hospital, Higº for the reception] an
maintenange of three poor men and three poor women. Of course the
charity had a Master, who was of course a clergyman, who ought to have
read prayers in the chapel, but who, on receiving a rather disagreeable
visit the other º from Mr. Inspector SKIRRow, admitted that for
some years he had read prayers in his own dining-room. This led to
an inquiry, what had become of the chapel, when
“The Master stated, in answer to questio
service had not been performed in the chapel for many years back was because it was
| totally unfit for church service; but he admitted that during that time he has used the
chapel as a private apartment for the convenience of his family.
“The Inspector inquired to what particular use the chapel had been applied.
“The Master said that it had been carpeted and furnished for the use of his
fºnd children, and that he had also kept in it barrels of beer, sacks of beans
ran &c.
The chapel seems to have been devoted to the good things of this
liſe rather than to any preparation for the next, and the Reverend
*::: appears to have used it for stowing away together his beer, his
children, i beans, and his governess. -
A perusal of the statutes at the inquiry before the Inspector must
have somewhat confounded the Reverend Master, who was bound by
the 20th statute to have presented a pair of shoes and 6s. 8d, once a
year to the visitors; but “those gentlemen then present,” says the
report, “declared that they had never received either during their term
of office, so that the charity was in large arrears to them on that head.”
We recommend the Reverend Master to contract iº with
some cheap shºe shop for a large supply of highlows, to enable him at
once to put this part of the awkward affair on a somewhat better
footing. From such arduous duties as he had to perform, which con-
sisted of reading prayers in his own dining-room, the Master was glad to
escape for six weeks in each year, during, which,” said the Commis:
sioner, “the Master let the house for four guineas a week, and did not
º a locum tenens.” We have heard a great deal of the abuse
of charities, but it was reserved for Stoke Pogis to supply an instance
of a Reverend, Master having converted a public hospital into a
private lodging-house.
The number of inmates had been reduced from six to four, whose
magnificent “maintenance” consisted of “seven half-quarterms o
|brºad and one and a hiſ of flour every fourteen days for the whole.”
|The vegetables, they had the glorious privilege of cultivating in the
garden “at their own expense,” and they were allowed a sfiling a
week each for meat, which at the present price, would give them about
nine ounces on Sunday, none on Monday and Tuesday, nine ounces on
Wednesday, and none on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. The poor
creatures were called in and examined, when, as might have been ex-
pected from the possession of spirits broken by semi-starvation, “they
had no cause of complaint, except the deficiency of meat”—or in other
g words they had no fault to find with their maintenance except that they
were half-famished.
It is to be hoped that the “visit” which has been paid to LoRD
HASTINGS's Hospital at Stoke Pogis will not prove a mere formal visit,
but that there will be no ceremony whatever in causing the restitution
of the funds of the institution to their legitimate objects.
“Get thee to a Nunnery,” &c. &c.
. THE Queen of Spain wishes that, “a thick veil be thrown over the
dissensions of the present struggle.”... We think it would be all the
better for Spain, and that it would be the quickest way of putting an

New Military Forces.
º NEws from St. Petersburg tells us that two
§ battalions of skaters have been formed at Cron-
stadt. When winter comes, they are to act upon
the ice. We have also heard that a sclf-taught
engineer of Aberdeen has submitted to our im-
petuous Premier the model of a gun capable of
being loaded with snow-balls, to act against the
skaters aforesaid. Further intelligence states
that the KING or PRussia, to show his sympathy
with his royal brother-in-law, and to act in con;
cert, as occasion may serve, with the Imperial
Cronstadt Skaters, has originated and drilled a
new Prussian force, to be called the Royal Berlin
Backsliders.
AN IMPROVEMENT ON EARLY CLOSING.
THE late closing of shops has been found to lead to the early close
of the existence of shopmen. Humanity has therefore demanded that
the shutters should be put up betimes, in order that the eyelids may
not be sealed prematurely, and that the ſº should be turned off at a
reasonable hour to prevent an untimely extinction of the vital spark.
Humanity has had one of these demands partially º: with; but
not the other. The shutters are pretty generally up about eight, but
the gas is not out till nine or ten. These observations are especially
..". drapery establishments; where counters have to be
cleared, windows undressed, and dummies, in many instances, put to
bed; the young men and apprentices doing the work of the nurse, and
being detained by that i. an hour or two after shop has been
t
shut.
We gather these facts from an “Appeal on behalf of the young Men
of Scarborough,” which those young men have published, and we are
happy to find that they have ºffi. to say for themselves. What
they have to say, in addition to the facts above-mentioned, is, that if
purchasers would, if possible, never “shop after an hour before closin
time,” this forbearance would allow them time for putting the shop j
accounts to rights, and for-taking needful recreation thereafter. So
that, if shops close at eight, and you want a et-handkerchief, go
and buy it at or before seven—if you can. If your pocket has been
picked, and you have a cold, that is another matter. On such an
mergency, the shopman will serve you gladly. “In those cases,” the
“Appeal” assures us, “no want of poliº attention, on the part of the
young men, would be experienced.” We do not doubt that. We do
not question that there would be an excess of polite attention. We are
even sure that the young men who sold the handkerchief would have
the superfluous politeness to say, “Any other, article to-night?” We
object to that question. It ought never to be capable of being put.
“Any other article to-day?” there is no objection to, except that it is
surplusage—and a query which bores. But to-night? No other article
to-night that will stand over till to-morrow; no article of any sort but
the article in the evening paper' . We know our old friend MRs.
HARRIs will quite agree with us in this sentiment; and we are sure we
feel, equally with that estimable lady, the force of the following
passage of the “Appeal:”-
“We might appeal to the religious, on the ground that these young persons rarely,
for a large portion of the year, have the opportunity of attending any religious week-
day service. To the moral, on the impossibility of the feelings being rightly cultivated
where there is so little opportunity for social intercourse, and where the whole of
youthful energy is expended in the service of Mammon; and to the friends of Educa-
tion, because the intellectual faculties cannot be improved when both mind and body
are exhausted with the long hours and fatigues of the day."
The foregoing passage suggests an admirable expedient for keeping
young men out of pleasure grounds and E. on a Sunday, to those
who consider that a desirable object. By abstinence from late shopping
you will give them time for recreation on working days, and in sº far
prevent them from . the Sabbath by excursions, or perhaps,
by what must be considered almost as bad, by drunkenness.

Stout Party (loq.). “DEAR 1 DEAR 1 DEAR 1 WHERE cAN THAT
STUPID Dog Have got Toº"
BEHIND THE SHUTTERs.
“My dear, these peas have no flavour.”
“Not a bit, my love.”
“You might as well eat bran, my dear.”
“Just as well; but—no matter—I’ll give it em. It’s very pro-
voking, my love, but—set your mind at rest—I’ll give it ’em as they
it is a pity they
never had it.”
Green peas are a sweet thing; like green youth;
should ever be spoiled., Our esteemed friend, MR. Dewi Ar (no Inaul
as a Christian was prouder of the beauty of his pew in the Church of St.
Oil-cum-Honey than Dewi AP)—our esteemed friend, we say, was par-
ticularly fond of green peas, and in the course of a tolerably long and
to himself extremely useful life, he had so educated his palate—and what
it had cost for its education not he himself could telſ—that with the
first green pea he could pretty well tell the hour when it was plucked;
whether at sunrise or sun-down; the precise time, too, when the pea
was shelled, whether a certain number of hours before dinner; or
whether, a few timely minutes before they were dropt into the #
Now, as the Sunday—it was a beautiful Sunday late in June—on which
MR. Dewi AP condemned the peas as being of no better flavour than
bran, he had been much comforted by a sermon under the roof of Oil-
cum-Honey, preached by the REveREND. Joshua, STICKLEBAck in
denunciation of Sunday bakings. A shoulder of mutton dripping upon
the under kidneys was a fearful type of what the consumers thereof in
this world might-upon his authority—take it upon themselves to
expect, upon the coals. MR, DEwardropt a five-shilling-piece in the
plate that day; and MRs. Dewi AP, observed to more than one friend
in the church-porch that they had been edified by a most sweet, dis-
course. When the Government wanted a bishop—she spoke in a
whisper—she only hoped that the Government would take its staff, and
make a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Oil-cum-Honey. -
The next day, MRs. Dºwlap's brougham stopped, with almost ominous
emphasis, at the door of Portles, flourishing fruiterer and ngrocer;
for the Dewlaps dwelt in the beautiful suburban vil of Tomtitfield.
Nevertheless, the shop of Portles might have fairly held up its head
even in Covent Garden; it was so rosy with fruit; and so fresh, so
cool with the freshest and coolest of vegetables. -
MRs. Dewlap, having nothing to do, would always overwork herself
by causing herself to be driven to her own tradesfolk. She only dealt
with people of unimpeachable character—in so far as that could be for
their station,--but how was she to know who was who, unless she
rsonally bent the whole powers of her intellect to the inquiry P.
ence, MRs. DEwAP drew up at the door of Portles.
In one moment Pottles was at the door of the brougham.
“MR. Porties, those peas you sent in yesterday”—
“Yes, my lady?”—
“They were like bullets. You’ll not contradict it, bullets.”
“Quite fresh, my lady. Picked on Saturday morning, and shelled
the very last thing over night.”
“Shelled over night!” exclaimed MRs. Dewlap, astounded by the
intelligence. “And do you think, MR. Portles, that you can dare to
hope to continue to serve me with shelled over night?”
Shouldn’t do it, of course, my ” said Pottles, who began to
ady,
feel all his guilt coming upon him, ºiling from the avenging brow of
*:::: DEwlap-" shouldn’t do it of course, except on a Saturday
night.”
“And wherefore on a Saturday night?” asked the lady. -
s .. my lady, because you know we don’t keep open any time of
a Sunday.”
"I should suppose not; or do you suppose I would lay out a penny
with an infidel? But if you do close on a Sunday, and have to supply
me with peas, can't you, at the last minute, shell them behind the
shutters?”
Portºs was weak—Porties was money-making—Potties, was
afraid of losing his custom. He had already been threatened with a
rival. What was to be done?
We cannot answer—that is, not for the very truth. But it is said
that never again did MR. or MRs. Dewlap º of insipid Sunday
peas. They asked no questions. Portues' Sabbath, shutters were, as
ever, closed; but who can tell what things were shelled behind the
shutters?
Next Parliament, MR. Dewi.AP intends to be returned for the
Borough of Coseysoul; if only, as he has been heard to declare, to lift
his voice against the unhallowed Bill of Joseph HUME—of the infidel
who would open the British Museum and the National Gallery after
the hours of church.
Perhaps, however, MR. DEwlap may be brought to a compromise:
he may vºte for the measure, with the amendment, that what is to be
seen may be exhibited—behind the shutters.
THE GALLANT FORTY-SIXTH.
HuRRAH for British bravery, for gallantry and worth!
Three cheers for English officers and gentlemen by birth!
The honour of the army is not an idle boast;
Fill high the pewter-pot—fill high—the Forty-sixth we toast.
What noble deeds of chivalry the Forty-sixth have dome!
How gallantly ten officers ºf . one!
What brilliant feats of daring honour to him who led
The six or eight who went to pull one ensign out of bed.
What valour and what bravery the Forty-sixth displayed,
When on each other's bedroom doors a grand attack they made;
When officers and gentlemen came to decisive blows,
Banging each other gallantly about the eyes and nose.
What bold and skilful º the Forty-sixth ºwed
. How cleverly the enemy was harassed and annoyed!
What splendid engineering! what tactics can compare,
With throwing all the bed-clothes into the barrack-square :
The boldness of the Forty-sixth ! how gloriously rash!
What recklessness of character—what recklessness of cash!
How heedlessly the officers a sacrifice can make
Of fame and money—turning both into a gambler's stake.
'Tis true that England is at war, but who can with her cope
When to the Forty-sixth she points-part of her pride and hope?
No wonder that the world in arms she boastingly defies,
While she upon her “officers and gentlemen” relies.
Let’s own that with the Forty-sixth no other can compare;
That in the British army its qualities are rare;
Upon itself alone, ’tis right, its character should fix;
Let’s strike from out the Army List the number Forty-sir.
Physic for the Enemy.
A Contemporary lately stated that the Government has been en-
din trying antimonial balls. It is necessary to observe that the
fº. in question were cannon-balls; otherwise it might be surmised
that the War Office authorities must have made themselves ill. The
advantage of these balls consists in breaking when they strike their
mark, and flying to pieces: thus flinging in all directions lumps of
metal, which, being antimony, are of course calculated to give all within
the sphere of their destructiveness a regular sickener.
AN INvARIABLE RULE-Let the wittiest thing be said in society,
there i; sure to be some fool present, who, “for the life of him, cannot
see it.”

GRAND FANCY FAIR,
FOR THE BENEFIT OF DESTITUTE BARRISTERS AND
CLERKS.
BARRISTERS'
HE Bar of England having
been for months past in
a state of the greatest
destitution, a few gene-
rous individuals have
succeeded in getting up
a Fancy Fair for the
relief of those Barristers
and Barristers' Clerks
who happen to be re-
duced to the last ex-
tremity of briefdom.
The Proprietors of
Her Majesty's Theatre
presented the Committee
with the free use of the
Theatre.
Yesterday this Grand
Fancy Fair took place.
Never did the beautiful
building look to so much
advantage | The large
chandelier was deco-
rated with handsome
bunches of red tape,
from which hung playfully huge clusters of legal seals. The effect at
a distance was excessively grand. --- - - -
At the back of the stage was observed a most ºlºgant illumination.
It consisted simply of three large letters, “L.A. W.”. Many a legal
bosom throbbed with feelings of honest pride on beholding those three
significant letters, shining, as they were, in jets of the most brilliant
gas, and entwined, as they always have been, in their associations
sº º; other fetters, not less potent or glittering in their eyes—
. s. d.’
In honour of the occasion, the playbills were printed on the backs of
old deeds and writs. This touching compliment seemed to affect
sensibly some of the oldest veterans of the Bar. One aged junior was
carried out in tears.
The Band of the Hanwell Lunatic Asylum was in attendance, and
pººl some of their most favourite tunes.
t the door were stationed two venerable QUEEN's Counsel, who
had formerly enjoyed the largest practice, but who were now reduced
to such a pitiable state that they were compelled for their living, to
write for the Magazines. Their wigs, round which was wreathed a
strip of black crape, were pulled over their eyes, and in their hands
they held blue bags, which were turned upside down, with their mouths
gaping hungrily open, as though apparently they were seeking whom
they could devour. fºehind these two veterans stood their two Clerks
thin and mouldy-looking, holding up their fee-books, which presented
as melancholy a blank as their countenances. From the books were
suspended large placards of brief paper, on which was written, in a
fine law.copyist's hand, the plaintive announcement of “, WE ARE
STARVING.'
Over the portico was a transparency of Lond ELDON. The worthy
Chancellor was represented before the celebrated Turnstile in Holborn,
pondering on which side he should go through.
The front of the boxes was hung with the handsome material from
which the silk gowns of Counsel are generally made. This material
was of the very finest texture. . The refreshment-rooms were decorated
with the common stuff that juniors delight in, but this was fluted most
elegantly, or arranged with great taste into fanciful festoons. The
cushions were all covered with serge of a warm legal buff, somewhat
similar to the colour of the usual bilious binding of ſaw books.
The general effect of the theatre was quiet, but imposing.
The principal stalls were held by dignitaries, whose names have
always been dear to the legal heart: MR. John Doe, opposite to whom
we noticed MR. RICHARD Roe, attended on this occasion at great
personal inconvenience to themselyes. They appeared in good health,
and many were the regrets heard that, they had retired so early from a
rofession they had so long adorned with their valuable presence.
hey sold a number of articles, and the rivalry between the two gen-
tlemen, as to which of the two should obtain the greater number of
victims, was excessively keen and amusing.
Moss. RoRERT MAGAIRE ſº the French, Bar) came purposely all
the way from Paris. His stall was excessively patronised. His porte-
monnaies, which were no sooner full than, by a coup de main, they were
empty again, had an enormous sale. A Lease, too, that wouldn't hold
water, amused the spectators exceedingly; and a good-natured Farmer
who was persuaded to become the temporary holder of one, caus
considerable amusement, in which the Lord Chancellor who was present
with his mace, joined most heartily -
A couple of stalls were held by the former managers of two Italian
Opera #. Their contributions to the day's receipts must have
been far from contemptible. They waged a fierce war all the time
about a trumpery bird (supposed to be a Prussian º kept
flying backwards and forwards from one to the other, and which neither
of them could catch. The burden of this bird's song was “England is
only to be valued for its money,” and it was a burden that seemed to
weigh excessively heavy upon the recoilection of many a poor broken-
down barrister present. - -
A picturesque model of a House in Chaneery excited a great deal of
admiration, and some pretty reduced copies of the same, with the
windows smashed exactly after nature, found ready purchasers... .
It was the subject of general remark, that at this legal Fancy Fair, as
at all others, “no change was given.” A bank note once, parted
with, no matter what its amount, was immediately appropriated to the
benefit of the fund, and the owner, as though he had been entering on a
Chancery Suit, never saw any of his property back again.
The proceedings terminated with t and playing the well-known
air of the “Rogue's March,” (during which, all the Lawyers present
uncovered) and the popular tune of "That's the teay, the money goes.”
The latter was the signal for every one to button up his pockets, and
to hurry away as fast as possible. -
The attendance was extremely select and respectable. MESSRs.
BRIEFLEss and DUNUP walked through the hall in the course of the
day. No Sheriff's Officers were admitted.
The day's receipts must have been enormous. Moss. Rob.' MACAIRE
alone took upwards of £200. It is to be regretted, however, that it is
always a matter of the greatest difficulty to get any accounts from that
honourable gentleman, #. difficulties on this occasion have been
rather increased than lessened. In the meantime, the Committee de-
clare that what little money they took was bad, and in fact, they
maintain that they are out of pocket by the whole affair. But this
statement is stoutly disputed, and there is a strong hope that the
entire matter will be thrown into Chancery. . In this latter...event,
the claims of the charity will not be exactly defeated, as the litigation
of the case, should it once find its way into Chancery, will fortunately
provide employment for several years to come tº several of our
most distinguished, but at present half-starving members of the Bar.
P.S. MEssRs. BRIEFLEss and DUNUP have just received retainers
in behalf of the Destitute Barristers and their unfortunate Clerks.
The Charity is in Chancery! The infamous robbers of the Destitute
will not be allowed to keep all the spoil to themselves.
AN ELEVATED COURT CIRCULAR.
(From our Prussian Gobemouche.)
His MAJESTY awoke this morning with his usual lº,
After an ineffectual attempt at shaving, in which his Majesty severely
gut himself (owing, it was said, to the bluntness of the razor) his
Majesty was at once attended to the breakfast-room, where, however,
he, as usual, found he had no appetite. . By the advice of his physician
a bottle of soda-water was immediately administered, and the King
i. afterwards took his prescribed walking exercise upon the
Trace.
By lunch time his Majesty was sufficiently recovered to enjoy his
usual two bottles of champagne, after which he found himself in a con-
dition to attend to business. Some important state matters, being
summarily disposed of, the King's attention was directed to the Eastern
question, which, with some facetiousness, he remarked he really
could’nt answer. It being afterwards announced that the French an
English ambassadors had urgently solicited an audience, his Majesty
was graciously pleased to observe that they might call again to-morrow.
Immediately his Ministers retired, the King held a private inter-
view with his butler, with whom he remained closeted for upwards of
an hour. There is no reason to believe that the conference was other-
wise than of an agreeable nature, although his Majesty appeared a
little flushed and excited after it.
There was no addition to the royal dinner to-day, with the exception
of a few extra bottles of champagne, of which his Majesty partook with
jºurned freedom, and was carried to bed somewhat earlier than
usual,
Antidote to Clicquot.
WE understand that MR. SAINSBURY, the eminent manufacturer of
soda-water, has received a large order for that article from Berlin. In
connection with this intelligence, it is reported that an eminent German
chemist and physician has been presented by the KING of PRussia with
a handsome gold medal, in acknowledgment of a memoir which the Pro:
fessor had the honour of submitting to his Majesty on the subject of
ammonia, particularly considered as a remcdial agent in relation to the
effects of inebriety.

A CASE OF REAL DISTRESS.
By a letter which may doubtless be accepted as a letter of
credit, it would really seem that the Seat of War just now
night be more correctly described as the Seat of Hunger, so
far at least as the British Army is concerned. The General
iu, chief command there appears to be a GENERAL Fast, and
whenever, a vacancy, occurs in anybody, here seems to be no
one appointed to fill it. Dating from “the Camp at Mona-
stir,” the Special Correspondent of the Daily News observes:
“It may sound strange, and perhaps appear incredible to people at home,
bnt still it is a fact that the troops out here in Bulgaria are half starving.
Whatever provision may have been made for the food of the troops, I believe
there is not a single man, not a general officer, in the Camp at Mºnastir,
who will dare to assert that the rations served out to the men are sufficient
for their maintenance. * * * The men have grown so thin that their
muscles are in an alarming state of softness. I felt the arms and legs of
many, and those not men who were on the Sick List, and I was quite
-tartled by their leanness, and the unhealthy relaxed condition of their
muscles."
We surely cannot expect much service of a man if we
deny him acquaintance with the dinner service, and although
our soldiers are in general obedient to command, it is surely
quite preposterous to bid them “stand at ease” upon an
|º stomach. The nature of the military man of course
| abhors a vacuum as much as that of any other; and although
| you may restrict him to “regulation stint” of food, you cannot
guarantee him “regulation stint” of appetite. if the present
almost Total, Abstinence System, be adhered to, we shall find |
our ranks thinned by famishin before they come to fighting,
and our artists will be sending home sketches of the emaciated
English, lying in the pose of the London Street Professional,
.# chalking “I am ::ff. on the Warna pavement.
Seriously, though, something must be done to alter this
“empty state” of things, or in speaking of our forces we
shall be reduced eventually to call them our weaknesses.
THE TURKISH MUSEUM.
(By one who has not seen it.)
We made sure that this Museum had a political meaning hidden
inside it, and that it would be full of political subjects that of late have
been a great deal talked about, but which none of us have seen.
However, we will describe the building as we expected to have
found it:—
Case I. “I’Homme Malade.”—In this case is shown a. full-length
view of the present SULTAN, in a very prostrate condition lying helpless
on the Ottoman. A Russian doctor, not unlike the EMPEROR NICHOLAS,
is in attendance upon him, about to apply some yery severe remedies
for his restoration. Whilst engaged in bleeding him at the extremities,
his hand is also raised against the SULTAN, as if in the act of levellin
a blow upon his crown. Two figures, attired in English and Frenc
| military costume, are rushing in at the back, with the intention, appa-
rently, of averting the blow.
Case II. “The Emperor's Ultimatums.”—This is not a very inter-
csting compartment, consisting merely of heavy bundles of paper,
each one being marked “Ultimatum.” There must be several hundreds
of these Ultimatums, and they fill a space somewhat larger than the
Queen's box at the Italian Opera.
CASE III. “The Battles %. Allies.”—There is nothing in this case
as yet; a donkey race with English officers, and that is all.
Case IV. The Seat of War.—This Seat is an Ottoman, that ap-
parently has been very much put upon. An English and French
General are extended at full length upon the Seat fast asleep.
| CASE W. The Protector of the Holy Places.—A tall military-looking
figure, with long moustaches and spurs, entering a mosque, and carry-
ing off the plate under the cloak of Religion. The cloaked figure
bcars an ugly resemblance to the Czar of all the Russias.
Case WI. A Jar of Caciare.—Captured by the English at Odessa.
Case VII. Sebastopol Taken—in French Chalks by LIEUTENANT
O'REILLY.
Case VIII. A Copy of the QUEEN's Speech—in which the English
Government is congratulated by HER MAJESTY upon Silistria having
been so gallantly defended—by the Turks.
CASE IX. The Panorama of the Danube—particularly those memorable
spots at which the Allies rendered such valuable service to the Turks
in their engagements against the Russians. -
Charact ER of THE WAR.—We read long accounts of the Fury
doing wonders in the Sound. The whole expedition to the Baltic
might be aptly described as “Sound and Fury, signifying nothing.”
WOL xxvii.
SINGULAR UNITY IN THE RUSSIAN ARMY."
UR astonishment is always at
at the small number of “killed ”
in the Russian Returns. In many
instances, they have been literally
“next to nothing,” as the saying
is, for they have actually not ex-
ceeded one. The factis, Nicholas
wished by so low a figure to con-
vey, a high notion of the courage
of his army; and though, it was
true, several thousands had per-
ished, still he was confident that,
inspired by the “orthodox faith,”
they had all fought and died
with the heroism of one man.
That was the reason he would
never allow the Deaths to exceed
that number. “Where there was but one heart and one soul,” he
lº frequently say, “there could not possibly be more than one
y.”
A New Cloak.
A New military garment has been registered under the name of the
“Court-MARTIAL Cloak.” The object of this new martial cloak is
to screen superior officers, and to save them on all occasions from
| public exposure. . It has been tried in one or two regiments, and
as been found to cover Majors. and Captains with the greatest
lease and comfort, but, if applied to the shoulders. of a poor
Lieutenant, it shrunk iniº , and did not afford him the least
protection. N.B. One trial (at Windsor, or elsewhere) will prove
the fact.
The Proofs of Popery.
AN advertisement states that
“The First PRoofs of CARDINAL WIsrwax are now ready for delivery."
We should like to see them. We have carefully weighed CARDINAL
| Whº's arguments, but we never discovered anything like proof
in them.
HOULD THIS CATCH THE EYE OF A POLICEMAN, it is to
tell him that I am going out of town, and that during my absence, which will be
for six weeks or thereabouts, my cook and all my servants will be upon Board Wages,
so that what he eats will be at their expense, and not at mine.

He ate his victuals and drank his beer in Rich-
mond Park, by the side of a cool and rippling
brook, which sufficed to allay the thirst of his
Companion, who is a teetotaller,-as, indeed, all
but drunken dogs are. His bread and cheese
were somewhat dry, to be sure; his ale had
become flat, and considerably warmer than was
desirable; but hunger is a good sauce, and thirst
is not particular. He therefore drained his keg
by means of his pocket-horn; and every time he
emptied that little vessel he drank the health of
the People, and enlightenment to legislators who
discourage the recreation which is necessary to
it, by depriving us of needful accommodation on
our Sunday excursions.
THE RICKETY CABINET.
Shaky and shatter'd 'twas,
Worm-holed and batter'd 'twas,
Never a trustworthy panel or slab in it;
All sorts of wood it had,
Ne'er a leg good it had,
Oh! 'twas the fustiest, mustiest Cabinet,_
The craziest, shatter’dest,
Ramshacklest, batter’dest,
Warnishedst, slackest-pegg'd,
Tarnishedst, blackest-legg’d,
Closest-patch'd, crossest-hatch'd Cabinet !
All had a pull at it;
John BRIGHT went skull at it;
If you meet an Exeter, Dizzy each knot-hole and crack tried to nabin it:
Hall-looking friend at Cremorne, it is always “the first time that he has ever been there.”
A man's ruin is never the result of his own folly—it is sure to be the fault, or treachery, of
some one else.
The man who neglects himself is sure in time to be neglected by others. -
In fashionable society nothing promotes conversation so much as “a little music.”
Ladies who “newer eat suppers,” generally eat the most.
OUR EXCURSIONIST ON SUNDAY.
THE proverb that Necessity is the mother of Invention, was illustrated last Sunday by
the devices adopted by the £º to provide themselves with that needful refresh-
ment, which, under the agreeable New Beer |.. they are prevented from obtaining at an inn,
not only at unreasonable, but at reasonable hours. Hampers, baskets, barrels, and all manner
of vessels capable of º: liquor, from stone bottles to black jacks, were piled on all
the railway platforms and crammed into the carriages; the out-of-town omnibuses and
steamers carried similar cargoes: and all the gigs, buggies, dog-carts, taxed carts, and other
humble vehicles on the various suburban roads, were laden with the same description of
luggage; of which sundry articles were even to be seen strapped upon the top of the neat
brougham, or occupying a space in the handsome carriage. The road and the river, in short,
presented such an appearance that it might have been supposed that races were going on
everywhere, and that the holiday-folks were engaged in the observance of a general Derby.
The subject of this article is in the habit of going for a long walk on Sundays—after one
o'clock. This practice is requisite for his bodily health: for his occupation is sedentary,
whilst his appetite is keen, and his corpulence, bui for taking strong exercise once a week,
would be excessive. -
He usually extends his walk about Richmond, because in that circuit he passes a
number of quiet old, houses; and still, shady avenues lie in his way, and other places and
objects breathing a spirit of repose that tends to allay the irritation of mind under which,
from the contemplation of affairs in general, and especially, his own, he generally labours.
About the middle of his journey he usually gets tired; hungry and thirsty always. Among
the old houses, above mentioned there are some of a public mature. At these he has been
in the habit of obtaining rest and refreshment—the latter including a limited quantity of
beer. But now their hospitable portals are closed against him on Sunday, and perhaps
very soon will be shut on every other day, if gentlemen, who can go to clubs as well as to
church, being blest with affluence, and therefore belonging to the better classes, continue to
legislate, in their present spirit, for himself and the rest of the worse—that is, the worse-off.
The privation which has been thus imposed upon him has exasperated him in the highest
degree; for nothing enrages him more than injustice and tyranny, particularly when practised
upon himself.
He is a person whose constant and earnest, but, unfortunately, ineffectual desire is to make
provision for the future. It was, however, in his power on Sunday last to secure bread and
cheese for lunch. He put a moderate loaf of the former and a suitable slice of the latter
into a wallet, slung to a shot-belt which he girded himself withal in the usual fashion. On
the previous day he had procured a small cask, such as reapers take into the fields: had
sent this to “the Jolly Gardeners,” and got it filled with strong ale. He strapped this cask
to his back, put a horn in his pocket, and, thus accoutred, sallied forth for his customary walk,
armed with his trusty cudgel, attended by his faithful dog, followed by a train of admiring
youth, and greeted by the smiles of everybody that he met,_except a few ugly and unwhole-
some lookingfellows in black suits and white stocks, who scowled on him.
Now a leg dropp'd away,
Now one was ſopp'd away,+
Till the wonder was how it continued a Cabinet.
The weakest, yet longest-lived,
Slackest, yet strongest-lived;
Making resistance most,
Lacking persistence most,
Never-die, ever-die Cabinet !
Winds whistled through its boards,
º: warp'd askew its boards,-
There was dry-rot, and mildew, and fungus and
scab in it;
Many tongues swore at it,
Many hands tore at it,
Allown'd 'twas shameful to keep such a Cabinet,
So wormy and moth-eaten,
Sluttish and sloth-eaten,
Strange and unshapenly,
Twopenny-halfpenn’ly,
Vamp'd-up and cramp'd-up a Cabinet !
None had a doubt of it,
Foul things crept out of it,'
Bred there like moths in a folded-up tabinet;
From the work to the wood in it,
Scarce º was good in it.
So every one said—yet it served for a Cabinet !
All sighing and squeaking still,
Groaning and creaking still,
Threatening to fall to bits,
Yet shaking all to bits,
Who measured their strength gainst this Cabinet.
Sure its upholsterer
Was a rare bolsterer—
Used to Wardour Street work, and a regular dab
lirit,
Who, 'gainst wind and weather,
Still made hang together
Such a set of materials in shape of a Cabinet;
But ours are King Log days;
Else, spite of the dog-days,
And the length of the session
And war-times’ depression—
Surely some one could turn out a decenter Cabinet.
NoHLE SACRIFICE.-We know a benevolent
old lady, who, ever since she has been told of
the great scarcity of paper, has discontinued
wearing curlpapers'

of a year's imprisonment; and on its being medically certified to the
authorities that the Warmint exhibited tokens of incipient dyspepsia,
which might be aggravated by diet he did not like, he was set at liberty,
after enduring a portion only of his sentence. His numerous friends
and admirers determined to receive him on his extrusion from gaol, and
to escort him in triumph to his lodgings, Nine-Eyed-Cat Lane, Garbage
Gardens, Whitechapel End. -
At least an hour before ColoneL CHESTERTON could make up his
mind to part with his interesting guest, two cabs and a cart drew u
before the prison, and about a dozen of the culprit's friends alighted.
We did not, observe any Member of Parliament among them. They
disposed of the tedious interval by smoking short pipes, occasionally
refreshing themselves with liquids which they had providently brought
with them, and otherwise beguiling the time with playful gibes at
passers-by, and with sportive announcements, through the little grating
of the door, that breakfast was a waitin and the muffins a gittin cold.
At length MR. STAGGERs was shoved out, and was received with a wild
hooray from his enthusiastic friends. He looked exceedingly well, and
even clean; but he seemed by no means in a good temper, stared at
the surrounding objects rather vacantly, and then intimated that his
audience had better stow all nonsense, and cut it. MR. STAGGERs was
promptly thrust into a cab, into which five companions followed him,
and their united consolations, and those of a bottle of the Ancient
Thomas Vintage, which was speedily produced, restored the Warmint
to something of his habitual placidity. The bewildered cabman, under
a storm of emphatic exhortations from each window, drove frantically
to Whitechapel, dashingly followed by the cart. MR. STAGGERs and
his friends partook, largely, of a substantial breakfast (furnished by
MR. Aitchbox.E, of the Harp and Warmingpan, with all his accus-
tomed liberality and taste), and the utmost cordiality and good feeling
—relieved from sentimentality by a couple of fights—were the order
of the morning.
Breakfast being over, and beer introduced, -
MR. JAMEs CRowbAR desired to say a few words; and the company
promptly requested that they might be very few. He said that their
friend STAGGERs had got out of quod, and how and why was nobody's
business. There he sat, and there was his good health, and confusion
to all Peelers. -
MR. StAGGERs did not appear to see any reason for taking further
notice of their remarks than by a grunt of satisfaction with the con-
cluding sentiment. But in answer to the general call, he rose and said
he was much obliged, and that if anybody thought that locking him up
and talking spooney to him was likely to alter him, anybody was not a
wise party. (It is possible that our reporter, who was disadvantageously
seated on a spike of the area railings, may have done inadequate justice
to the force of MR. STAGGERs's ...'. He added that he had cer.
tainly been led into an error, which he hoped his friends would pardon.
An extra touch on the head would have rendered his prosecutrix unable
to say much about him; but he admitted that he had been weak. We
was all asses at times, but such a mistake should not occur again. He
drank all their jolly good healths, and wished that they would be off,
for he was uncommon sleepy. - -
On this hint the party, and a band of Anglo-Ethiopians who had
been performing various tunes before the house, in honour of the
occasion, received a good many more kicks than halfpence from the
dispersing guests. MR. STAGGERs intends, at the earliest vacancy, to
offer himself as one of the Churchwardens of Whitechapel.

The Fate of Umbrellas.
WHEN a person is carrying a cotton umbrella, it is, curiously enough,
never his own property—he “has just borrowed it from a friend.” If
our own experience did not tell us a very different story, it would seem
as if it fell to the fate of only cotton umbrellas to be borrowed / .
ducive: and it must in truth be owned, that by his present course the
KING OF PRUssíA runs the risk of losing his crown—in England he
certainly would run the chance of being fined one. In sober serious-
ness, then, we would advise His Majesty to take the pledge at once, for
we cannot but regard his now frequent elevation as the height of im.
prudence.
Uniform of the Forty-Sixth.
SoME mistake appears to exist about the Guards—a name applied by
many people to troops not so calling themselves. Among these may be
included the gallant 46th. This now famous corps does not profess to be
a regiment of the Guards, but certainly ranks as such in popular
estimation... If not disbanded, it will probably obtain the appellation of
the Royal 46th Guards (Jet).
AN ILLUMINATED CHURCH.
THE Puseyites have quite a Cossack’s love for tallow-candles, and
one of the reasons why they use so many of them in their churches
—decorating the altar and other places with candles of all sizes—may
be, that they hope by so doing to bring the Protestant religion into a
state of what is popularly called “sixes and sevens.”
WHERE BAD SONS ARE SENT TO.
For MERLY the Scamp of the Family used to be sent into the Navy;
but we should say the system of family transportation was altered now,
for, judging from recent Court Martials, all the Scamps must have been
sent into i. Army.

WITH halyard and rattlin the wild wind is battling,
The canvass is flapping from yard and from boom;
The hail and the sleet on the sky-lights are brattling,
In the teeth of the gale comes the thunder-cloud's gloom:
On our course as we’re bounding, the breakers are sounding,
The water is shoaling beneath the ship's keel;
Ten to one we may touch on the reef we are roundin
What matter? “Don’t speak to the man at the wheel !”
The rising and falling of the wind mocks the bawling
Of the hoarse master's call, through the trumpet conveyed:—
For basins and brandy the passengers calling—

Her bows wildly yawing—and ma †.".
Now to starboard, now larboard, haphazard we reel:
To the fatal lee-shore near and nearer we’re drawing—

The chaos that reigns both above and below,
But ne'er fash your thumbs: soon the strait will get broader,

THE WOMEN AND THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.
THE Electric Telegraph Company has organised a band of female
Clerks to work the Electric Telegraph. It is a happy idea to turn the
gentler, sex to account by employing, the ladies in a task which will
give full, scope to their love of rapid talking. We have known and
(unhappily) heard tongues that can É. at a tremendous rate, but to
talk as quick as lightning is a luxury that the women have not yet been
able to . and we doubt not that there will be a rush of gratuitous
Clerks, when, it is generally known that females may have the oppor-
tunity of talking by Electric Telegraph. We may expect a at
increase of speed from the new arrangement; for if a man can talk at
the rate of a thousand miles a minute, it is impossible to say what will
| be the .# attained by a woman, who can always run on far beyond
the speed of the most rapid male orator.

Of a fine old

With a fine old

While now and then a candlestick at somebody there goes:
Mid those fine young English officers all of the modern time.
When off to bed they seem to go they on each other call,
And burst into each other's rooms, and raise a midnight brawl;
Pull'd from his couch a subaltern upon the floor may sprawl,
And out of window goes his bed, sheets, blankets, quilt, and all;
Thrown by these fine young officers all of the modern time.
But fun so fast must have an end, and words may get so high,
That blows will follow, and may leave a mark upon the eye;
Which e'en the Colonel cannot pass wholly unnoticed by...
And a Court Martial must be held, and people will say Fie!”

For such extremely blackguard pranks they never could have played,
If anything like gentlemen they’d been by nature made :

A WORD FOR MR, WALKER.
“Sic vos non vobis mellificatis apes.”—MR. VIRGIL.
A CoRREspondent of the Daily News complains that MR. WALKER,
the famous author of “Gatherings from Graveyards,” has been left out
in the arrangement of the new Board of Health. As the existence of
any Board of Health at all is probably owing to the researches and
publications of MR. WALKER, this omission is certainly rather like that
of the PRINCE of DENMARK in the performance of Hamlet.
It is true that at the head of the Board we have a very proper man;
a man of eminent scientific, as well as administrative ability. For SIR
BENJAMIN HALL is something more than a shrewd, and active, and
intelligent reformer. He is a man of science, too. Of course, he is.
Sanitary Reform requires a knowledge of the laws of health and disease;
of the relations of the human organisation to surrounding circumstances,
and of their agencies upon it: physiology, nosology, chemistry; in all
which matters, doubtless SIR BENJAMIN HALL is well versed. The
President of the Board of Health must, at least, know as much about
the subject of his administration as the President of the Board of
Control knows about India. , Still, two heads are better than one, and
perhaps the sanitary knowledge of SIR BENJAMIN, HALL is not quite
so perfect as to be incapable of being augmented by any suggestion
which he might possibly derive from MR. WALKER.
nations which not only prevails in the learned
|Army and Navy, and has now been adopted in the Civil Service, the
It is, of course, quite right that, the chief of the Board of Health
should not be a Physician. The medical faculty is not the faculty of
common sense. Therapeutics have nothing to do with hygienics, and
the Art of Cure is a different thing from the Science of Prevention.
You would not consult the parish Doctor as to the means of keeping
well; on that subject you would rather ask the advice of the district
Surveyor. Still, MR. WALKER is a man who knows as much about
sanitary matters as anybody in London—perhaps not even excepting
that eminent man of science, SIR BENJAMIN HALL. He is a gentleman
whose public services are vast and unacknowledged, and there is every
reason why he should be a member of the Board of Health, except that
he is a Surgeon, and is therefore voted ineligible for “office” by the
gentlemen of red tape. . It is not wonderful, to be sure, that a prejudice
Against the medical profession should be entertained by political quacks.
Nevertheless, it is carrying this prejudice rather too far to exclude
MR. WALKER from the constitution of a Sanitary Board. He is a
surgeon—but he is a very able one. Is there no room at the festive
Board of Health for MR. WALKER:
SITUATIONS FOR “SOCIETY.”
At a highly genteel meeting, numerously attended, and including
many distinguished members of the aristocracy, which was held yes-
terday at JENKINs's Rooms, to consider the steps which it will be
incumbent on society to take in consequence of the system of exami-
rofessions, but in the
following resolutions were put and carried :-
Moved by ALGERNoN SPRIGGE, and seconded by Jessam IE
PHIPPS, Esqrs.,
That the examinations which it is now necessary to undergo in order
to enter any profession, or to obtain any office or situation regarded as
suitable to a gentleman, constitute a serious obstacle to the acquisition
of that employment which the junior and other less opulent members
of society are unfortunately under the necessity of procuring.
Moved by the DUKE of DUNSINANE, and seconded by the
MARQUIs of GoTHAM,
That the intellectual exertion, required to enable a candidate for
office, military or civil, to pass the least difficult ordeal to which he
| could be subjected, is much too severe to be endured by the majority
of young gentlemen moving in society who have been educated to fill
an employment suitable to their position.
Moved by SIR CHARLEs DAWDLE, and seconded by the HoN.
MR. LoLLINGTON,
That the occupations which have heretofore been considered gen-
tlemanly by Society, must now, on account of the study exacted by
them, be regarded as laborious.
Moved by Wiscount SIMPER, and seconded by DUDLEY
SMIRKE, Esq.,
That the anxiety attendant on the intellectual application involved
in preparing for examinations is productive of an uneasy and careworn
look, and sometimes of a tendency to frown and stoop, and other
ungainly peculiarities, in place of that serenity of aspect and elegance
of deportment which have hitherto characterised the majority of those
who constitute Society, and are denominated the Superior Classes.
Moved by Lord DRAwley, and seconded by CAPTAIN Lisp,
That in the opinion of this Meeting it has become necessary for
Society to reconsider its estimate of the dignity of avocations and
employments, in order to the maintenance and preservation of the
principle which ranks as the most honourable those which demand the
least industry. And Society, is accordingly recommended by this
Meeting to stamp with the seal of gentility He situations of shopman,
and clerk in a mercantile or lawyer's office: and to brand with the
stigma of snobbishness and vulgarity all places at the Treasury and
Somerset-House.
Moved by EARL PLUSHINGTON, and seconded by MR. BUCKLEs,
That this. Meeting esteems the situation of an official Secretary as
decidedly inferior in dignity to that of a valet-de-chambre.
The Lads of the Forty-Sixth.
OF all the Corps in HER MAJESTY's Service, the 46th is that which
may, with the greatest propriety, be called an infantry regiment, as the
pranks which its junior officers are accustomed to play upon each other,
are of a description so puerile. But we hope the 46th is not the
Nursery of the British Army.
NAPIER NAPPING IT.
WE have often been puzzled to find out why NAPIER is so familiarly
spoken of as “OLD CHARLEY.” We think we have at last discovered
the appropriateness of the sobriquet, for the Old Charleys had a shocking
character for going to sleep on their posts.
A STORY WITHOUT FOUNDATION.
THE GARRET story is the Fº story; but if we add to GARRET
another T, we must regard the story as a base story—as base as any
story can be that has no basis.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HIGH PRICE OF PAPER.
We must confess we are astonished beyond description, either in
prose or poetry, at the high price of paper being still maintained. e
should have thought that the numberless despatches and interminable
autograph letters, which have been flying backwards and forwards
between St. Petersburg and Berlin, and the endless diplomatic notes
that have been exchanged between Austria and those States, would have
lowered the value of waste paper so considerably as to have lessened
the value of paper at least one half. There can have been no want of
materials for making paper, when we think of the extensive corres-
pondence that has been going on for months in relation to this still-un-
answered “Eastern Question.” What has become of all this cor-
respondence? As for its value, it cannot be of the slightest worth to
any one, excepting to buttermen and trunk-makers, and it is high time
that the notes and letters, being completely such dead letters, were
sold. What has become, also, of all the EMPERoR of Russia’s “Ulti-
matums?” In *Wi. alone, they would be a small fortune to
the holder of them, Whoever is the lucky H. should come
forward and throw them into the scales of public competition.
PUNCH'S HANDBOOKS TO THE CRYSTAL
PALACE.
THE GREEK COURT (Continued.)
THE principal objects of interest in the Greek Court are the pieces of
sculpture, some of which are so well known and have been so frequently
described, that we might as well attempt to get blood out of the stone
of which they are composed, as to extract º from them.
First on the list is VENUs WICTRIx, from the Louvre, representing
that rather coarse creature, familiarly known as a fine woman. Such a
VENUs would conquer rather by her muscle than by her beauty, and
though the latter might, vulgarly speaking, strike one all of a heap,
the former might knock one over in a still more decisive manner.
No. 4 is the celebrated Quoit-thrower, or Discobclos, of which there
are many copies. The figure is in the rather difficult position of
throwing the quoit, which the sculptor has caught rather happily.
No.5 is a Warrior from the Louvre, who is generally known in England
as the Fighting Gladiator, and who has probably been seen by many of our
readers in the person of some suburban Signor, who “does the statues.”
º
d

at a minor theatre in a suit of white fleshings, a wig of wool, and a
countenance thickly embedded in chalk—a style of getting-up which
is supposed to qualify the worn-out Harlequin for the embodiment of
or any of the “classical heroes of antiquity.”
No. 16 brings us to Laocoon and his Sons, from the Vatican. A
group which has come down to the very humblest on the heads of half
the Italian image boys, who offer us “Signon, MILtone” for eighteen
pence, or will throw in “SIGNoS Shaksperi” for an extra shilling, if
we will take the pair of them. Laocoon was the son of PRLAM, who
attempted to keep out of Troy the wooden horse by setting up a pike,
but he had no sooner raised his lance than he found himself encircled,
with his two sons, by a brace of serpents in one of the most affecting
instances of a family tie that has ever been witnessed. This magnificent
lººk of art is too noble to be idly touched by the fingers of innovation,
and we therefore can hardly excuse the officiousness which has lent a
hand to the elder son, who had lost one of his arms—the right—and
helped him to a set of new tips for his toes, out of pity to the
extremities which he had been reduced to.
| No. 25 is a copy of the JAsox in the Louvre, which has been
usually called “CINCINNATus tying on his Sandal,” as if CINcis NATus
had been rather slovenly about the feet, or was in the habit of slippin
out of his own shoes, instead of adhering to the walk of life to º:
he was accustomed. The mistake has, no doubt, arisen from the pro-
pinquity of the ploughshare, which was the only share of the gifts of
fortune that CINCINNATUs wished to appropriate.
No. 30 brings us to SoMNUs, who almost sends us to sleep when
we look at him. So drowsy is the
aspect of the figure that we are almost
º to pay the highest tribute
to the sculptor's talent by shutting
our eyes to it.
No. 34 is the sleeping ENDYMIox
in relief, from the Capitol at Rome,
a figure in which repose and grace
are so blended as to present in this
alto-relief one of the finest specimens
of out-door relief that can be afforded
by the artistic union already men-
tioned.
No. 51 represents THALIA, who has
been much misrepresented by the
modern writers of comedy. She is
seen at the Crystal Palace with a
mask in one hand and a roll in the
other—the roll probably containing.
some of that fancy bred in her brain,
though the mask does not present any
very agreeable features.
No. 65 is a diminutive philosopher from Munich, who from the
smallness of his size, was probably one of those philosophers who are
not destined to make a very great figure. The head does not belong
to the body, but this is natural enough, formany a philosopher has lost
his head, which, under such circumstances, is of no use to any one-not
even to the owner.
Nos. 69 and 71 are horses' heads, the former being peculiar for
the arrangement of its mane, and the latter for the absence of its eyes,
which leave us in the dark as to its origin. If we might indulge in
speculation without the aid of the eyes, we would hazard the conjecture
i. the head, is that of some blind horse of the dark ages, which may
have worked in some cart employed in the removal of the dust of
antiquity.
No. 78 will be easily recognised as “CUPID and PsycIIE;” avery
familiar subject, though this is the only specimen in which the figures
are without the wings which usually mark their flightiness. The Cupid
is a very “old love,” and has undergone a good deal of restoration
about the nose and chin-the points upon which age is likely to tell,—
and has also been supplied with a new
foot, which many an old Cupid who is a
martyr to the gout would be glad to be
provided with.
In No. 79 we have another THALLA,
from the Louvre, with her head very
much worn by the action of the atmos-
here. One would suppose that the
use had been accustomed to exhibit in
booths and shows in the open air, which
may have subjected her to such an
amount of fair wear and tear as to have
seriously affected her head, and deprived
her of that genuine mirth which in these
days she fails to manifest.
No. 119 furnishes us with some por-
tions of the bas-relief of TRAJAN's cele-
brated column at Rome, with which no
column of the Times can compete in interest. It is a record of the
deeds of the Emperor whose name it bears, and it is very creditable to
Apolloponus, its author, to have condensed so much history into a
single column.
At No. 178 B, we come to the renowned marbles, which have given a
sort of monumental fame to the name of Éiºns. This fortunate noble-
man came over to England with a magnificent collection of marbles in
1801, but it was not till 1816 that the British nation, after a consider-
able amount of funking, was induced to knuckle down to the extent of
£35,000, which was the sum paid for the purchase of these treasures.
The Annual Register (Vol. 58) contains the report of a Select Com-
mittee of the House of Commons which sat upon those marbles for a
considerable time, and did justice to the labours with which Loko

right to turn an honest º - - -
The Government of that day, like the Government of almost every
other day, refused to contribute anything to the advancement of art as
a national object—a matter in which Governments seldom interfere,
except to be alternately penny wise and pound foolish. LoRD ELGIN
was therefore left to prosecute his task at his own cost, anti to save
these marbles from the Turks, who were in the habit of amusing them-
selves by taking shots at the figures, which would probably have ended
in macadamising, the streets of Athens, if they had not been pre-
#. to pave the way to a new and improved standard of taste in
and.
lese marbles tell their own story so well, that we shall not insult
the sculptor PHIDTAs by pointing to the procession on the frieze, and
j: “ those figures are men on horseback,” or “that article is
intended for a helmet,”—a style of description which is justified by
nothing but the failure of the artist to express his own meaning.
. No. 187 represents NIOBE, whose boast, like that of a witness
in a police court, was to be “the mother of a large family.” This
reiteration of the rather doubtful merit of extensive maternity, rendered
NIOBE such a nuisance, that one day when bursting out in her favourite
character of the “mother of fourteen children,” she insulted LATONA,
who happened to come in her way, by throwing in the face of the latter
the whole of their aggregate families. LATONA's irritation induced her
to complain to her own offspring, APOLLO and DIANA, who at once
abated the NIoBE nuisance by destroying the NIOBE children, . One
only was spared, a daughter, named CHLoRIS, who is represented in the
Crystal Palace as attending on NIOBE herself, who having been º
all fire and fury, became all water and slop, for she took to perpetua
tears, and after having been nearly all her life a roaring termagant, she
ended her days as a crying evil. The group has been assigned to
PRAXITELEs, though in some parts the critics pretend to trace an
inferior chisel.
No. 198, will be easily recognised as the renowned VENUS DE
MEDICIs, of which the original may be seen at Florence. This statue
has been more written on perhaps than any statue in the world, though
after all that has been .. it tells its own story best in a few lines, of
beauty. The moderns have had a hand—indeed two hands—in this
work of art, for the arms are both of them “restorations.”
Without descending from the pedestal of the writer to the rostrum
of the auctioneer, it would be impossible to enumerate all the objects of
interest in the Greek Court of the Crystal Palace. In a mere Catalogue
they number 217 Lots, scarcely one of which can be said to fall under
the common lot, for genius has given, to nearly every one, a sort of
immortality. Were we to attempt to do justice to each and all of the
numerous objects that claim our admiration, we should be compelled to
anticipate a very important addition to the Greek Court, for we should
be occupied till the arrival of the Greek Kalends.

cession was ready to start, it was found that Russell Square, capacious as it is, would not hold it, and large bodies
of persons had to move down the adjoining streets in order to give the leaders an opportunity of making a dignified
exit. Every description of vehicle which could be begged or borrowed was brought into requisition to convey
the enthusiastic votaries of Bacchus, and the procession was made of omnibuses, cabs, clarences, broughams,
... gigs, &c., headed by bands of music, the vigour of which must have taken the aristocratic residents of Russell
Square and its neighbourhood not a little by surprise.”
This must have been a slight nuisance—particularly to any inhabitant of the vicinity troubled
with a headache...Those who ought to know what that suffering is might have been more
considerate. Besides, how could they tell that they were not disturbing somebody’s last
moments, or the first moments of somebody else—and the repose of somebody else's mamma P
“Shortly after 11 o'clock the procession made a start, amid the deafening cheers of the persons who composed
it, some hundreds of whom were children, designated the “Band of Hops,' who are bound by a solemn league
and covenant never to drink water themselves, and to discourage the practice in others.”
As if children were capable of being bound—except by their sponsors—to any league or
covenant whatever; whether solemn or absurd: whether to drink water or brandy. Such
children must be very precocious; but an unhealthy precocity is one of the results of gin:
and children who vow to discourage any practice on the part of others, but that of doing
mischief or of eating trash, must have been previously seduced into an extreme state of liquor.
"MR. Hough, the well known Bacchanalian singer, whose sudden and remarkable transition from teetotalism
to habitual inebriety is well known, headed the procession which moved along Tottenham Court Road, Oxford
Street, Regent Street, Pall-Mall, Whitehall, Pariiament Street, over Westminster Bridge, down the York Road
to Blackfriars Road, and thence through Walworth to the Surrey Gardens, where a grand fête took place.”
What an intolerable obstruction in the streets they must have created!
"On entering the Gardens, there was a gathering by the Band of Hops, when each member was presented by
Ma. Hough with his “Address to the Young? Afterwards there was a meeting on the lawn, at which Ma. Hough,
| made respecting his change of habits.
MR. Gormond, and other gentlemen spoke on the subject
of drinking. Later in the day there were salutes of
cannon, and musical performances by various professionals.
In the evening there was a display of fireworks, and other
representations for which the Surrey Gardens are so re-
markable. The whole of the proceedings, which were
very well managed, were under the direction of the London
Bacchanalian League.”
Here were rare orgies | Here was a jolly row !
A mob choking the thoroughfares, parading the
streets with bands of music, shouting, bellowing,
vociferating, for no reason whatever, and utter-
ing “deafening cheers” to the annoyance, if
not injury, of everybody except the aurists, and
Messrs. Solomons—what are we to think of
such a concourse but that it was a most tipsy
rabble? What is such outrageous conduct as
this indicative of but of being half-seas-over,

the worse as to be literally roaring drunk. We
naturally ask what these roysterers had been
having, and what they had been giving the un-
happy infants whom they encouraged to imitate
their own noisy and riotous behaviour * -
But we are going too fast—like the people
whose extravagances are above related. There
are a few corrections to be made in the foregoing
quotations from the Times. For “Bacchamalian’”
read “Temperance,” and carry out the same
principle of emendation to the end. Substitute
‘Band of Hope” for “Band of Hops,” and alter
“Bacchanalian singer” into “Temperance ora-
tor,” call the gentleman alluded to Gough,
instead of Hough, and reverse the statement
With
such exceptions as these, however, we have
faithfully transcribed our contemporary's report
of the “Great Temperance Demonstration.”
The uproar, the obstruction, the wild excitement,
the tumultuous disorderly behaviour on which
we have commented, are facts. Only they were
not, at least they professedly, were not, the
results of intoxicating drink. They were meant
for manifestations of total abstinence; on beh
of which system they afford just this argument,
that the great mass of teetotallers can make
as great fools of themselves on water as other
people can be made by alcoholic fluids, and
get, as tipsy on tea, or on, nothing, as ordinary
individuals can on wine and grog. Thus a tee-
totaller might be considered to be a person
who abstains from fermented liquors because
he can be sufficiently drunk without them.

INFINITELY BETTER THAN THE RIDICULous old CoATEE | | "
|MEMORANDUM FOR YOUNG OFFICERS.
| It is particularly recommended that every Officer who
º a regiment shall have an independent income besides
his pay, sufficient not only to live upon, but to support a
life of that fast description that becomes an officer and a
gentleman.
In cases where it may not be possible to comply with this
recommendation, the young officer is advised to incur debt
rather than odium, for the latter is calculated to bring him
into disgrace, but the former will extend his credit.
Officers should make it their invariable rule to do every-
thing...like a gentleman; and this particularly applies to
ºf money. Prudence is not a quality the cultivation
of which is desirable on the part of those whose profession
|it is to risk their lives... It invariably exposes who act
on its principles to obloquy and contempt, because by
abstinence from gratifications in which others indulge,
officers set their comrades a disagreeable example.
An officer who does not spend the whole º his income
will be naturally required to lend the remainder. Every
ºfficer of experience well knows that money lent, should
be regarded as money lost. The probability is that the
officer, who borrows will, however honourable may be his
intention, be unable to repay what he has borrowed, for
the same reason as that for which he borrowed it in the
first instance. Officers therefore had better spend all they
have, so that they may not have anything left to lend, or
to get stigmatized as mean and shabby for not lending.
Thus they will at least secure their money's worth in
pleasure, besides acquiring the name of fine fellows. It
may even be expedient that they should notoriously exceed
their means, to preclude all troublesome applications on
the part of their comrades: and every officer should
remember that it is his duty, on any emergency, to sacrifice
his tailor.
By carefully attending to the above suggestions, and
acting otherwise in their spirit, the young officer ma

THE ROMANCE OF THE SECOND COLUMN.
Accorning to the dismal inuendoes darkly shadowed forth in the
second column of the Times, everybody seems to be abandoning every-
body else, and the column in question ought to be regarded as a species
of monumental column, sacred to the memory of those dear departed
who seem to be continually running away from their wives and families.
One day last week there was a fearful catalogue of absconded husbands
and miscellaneous runaways.
The following appeal is rather deficient in that romantic interest which
usually pervades the second column of the Times; and indeed it will be
difficult for the most morbidly melancholy imagination to invest the
advertisement with much ideality:—
A W. (if this should be seen) is earnestly requested to COMMUNICATE
• immediately with J. H. M., late of R-fus C—ttage, at Golden Cross Hotel,
Charing Cross.
The only really mysterious part of this advertisement is the omission

say that we are not proud, and shall be happy to make his acquaint-
ance. It is natural enough that he should “know not what is revealed,”
for “the spirit of kindness” is not particularly knowing.
A key to the next advertisement on our list would be very acceptable.
O A. W. CIN. O.-ALL's WELL ; a lovely Baby. Advise, on

and is not the “old address” of “CIN" a locality to which no respect-
able person would think of making an application?

LATEST FROM PRUSSIA.
(From our own Detective.)
EcENTLY the war has given
great employment to the
Gobemouches, and one of its
heaviest taxes, perhaps, has
been the tax which they have
laid upon our patience by
the absurd reports they
have contrived to circulate.
Stories without end have
been raised upon the flim-
siest foundation, and as pro-
lific writers of fiction, “our
own Correspondents” may
be almost said to have
rivalled MR. JAMEs the
Novelist, or ALEXANDRE
DUMAs. The news they tell
us in the newspapers of

to turn out nonsense in
those of to-morrow, and
scarcely any of their letters
can be regarded wholly as
letters of credit.

upon to swallow, it was the other morning stated, “on the most reliable authority”
(an authority which we usually have found the most liable), that the KING, of
PRussia had at length “given a º proof of his adhesion to the English.”
t
Being of course extremely suspicious of this “fact,” we considered it our duty
as Reviser-General of the Press to dispatch at once, a Special Hoax-Detective
to the Court of that (frequently) elevated Monarch, with instructions to sift out
the truth of the matter through the sieve of his experience. Thanks to the Post
Office his despatch has been characterised by the very reverse of that quality,
but the explanation we have been so long in receiving we will in brief communicate.
It appears then that his Majesty has lately, in his mºre sober moments, been trying
to cultivate an acquaintance with our language, and his “adhesion to the English.”
is, therefore, only a politer phrase to express his recent sticking to the study of
that tongue. The “proof” which was spoken of is discovered to have been merely
the printer’s “proof” of some lines which his Majesty did lately by way of an
exercise, and which, although printed “for private circulation only,” we do not
scruple in the least to make as fully public as a place in Punch is certain to
ensure:-

And friendly states claim our assistance,

CRITICISM ALL HOT.
No person expresses himself with more real strength than Mr. Punch, and
| although he is not absurd enough to expect that the writings of anybody else should
exhibit that exquisite mixture of intensity and elegange which renders his teaching
at once the instruction and the delight of mankind, he is never displeased, in a
superficial age, to see energetic sentiments, put forth. But there is a limit to all
things, and he cannot but think that the editor of the Shropshire newspaper, out
of which Mr. Punch extracts the following declaration, is inclined to infuse almost
too much fire into his diction. The writer in question is complaining that a certain
Ms. HAy’s Musical Entertainments were not sufficiently patronised in Shrewsbury.
Whether Hay did not make himself when the sun shone, or whether those
who took the LIND-fever are proof against all other complaints, including the
Hay fever, we are not aware, but MR. HAY was not successful, and thus the
delinquents are castigated:—
“The prond Salopians must bevery poor, or very shabby, to hold back under these circumstances,
-- there is an absence of all-spirit-in-Shropshire, except where-eating and drinking are concerned.
The mind appears to be quite a secondary consideration, and the belly the all-absorbing object of the
affections. These are plain words, but not one whit the less true. Were we Min. HAY, we would see
the town of Shrewsbury, and the county, d-, before we would toil, and sustain loss, for such an
illiberal-minded set.”
Now, we are not, of course, so well informed as the Salopian journalist, as
to what kind of remonstrance is most effective with readers in º proximity
of the Wrekin, but brief sojourns in the county of Salop have left upon our
minds the impression that somewhat more gracious words, might be appropriately
used upon such an occasion. The proud Salopians seemed to us to be, generally
speaking, affable, courteous to strangers, and as intelligent
as provincials are likely to be; and really, even though one
of their own body chastises them with scorpions after this
fashion, we feel inclined to protest against such merci-
less treatment. The punishment º certainly exceeds
the offence, which we take to he the staying away from
some concert. Now our friend the indignant “Man from
Shropshire” may take it from us, that any entertainment ||
which the public does not patronise is not worth the
patronage of the public. The business of the contriver of
an entertainment is to entertain, and people know quite
well whether they are likely to be entertained or not,
And so, if we are not taking too great a liberty, we would
respectfully hint that the Shropshire critic would better
serve MR. Hay, by pointing out to him the most likely
mode to please the Shrewsburians, than by suggesting
to him to obtain a previous sight which we trust is not
in store for him. }. is just possible that the character
of provincial journalism might be improved by a little
more general adoption of the amenities cultivated by the
metropolitan press. Imagine the Times, or the Chronicle,
some morning, making such a recommendation as the
above to an unlucky ºnficiare at the Hanover Square
Rooms. And are not provincials our fellow-creatures, and
entitled to be treated with as much humanity as we demand
for ourselves? Echo answers in the affirmative, and we beg
to transmit her answer for the consideration of our Shrop-
shire contemporary.
A PLEA FOR THE PEWTER.
SoME folks have a skin that’s marvellous thin,
And BAREBONEs they revere:
And it’s sinful they say to moisten one's clay.
With a drop of Sunday beer.
For my part I ain’t so severe,
And at this hot time of the year,
On my Sundays out, I can’t do without
My modest allowance of beer.
Some folks, it’s true, prefer to look blue
When a joke or a laugh they hear;
Their house of callis Exeter Hall,
And their tipple is tea, not beer.
Now I’m no teetotallere,
Though a temperance course I’d steer,
And down I’ll cough Mr. Orator Gough,
Whenever he talks against beer.
Some folks at their feasts will make themselves beasts,
And home zig-zag will steer:
Bands of Hopelet them follow, and pledges swallow,
And Orator Gough go hear;
But as I can enjoy good cheer,
And yet keep my noddle clear,
I can't understand why you thrust your hand
Betwixt me and my Sunday beer.
All the week at my work Istand like a Turk
From beginning to end of the year;
And on Sundays I rest, and put on my best,
And at church I always appear.
But the parson I go to hear
Don't feel called to interfere
With my afternoon walk, and tea-garden talk
With a friend or two over our beer.
Heaven gave malt and hops, as well as slops,
And to me it’s perfectly clear, -
As the rich have their wine, so the poor, when they dine
Were meant to enjoy their beer.
The Wine Rhenish folks may cheer,
And Hollands is jº for Mynheer:
And the Briton bold shall never be told
There’s sin in a drop of good beer!
For my part I think both in meat and drink,
'Tis abuse, not use, we should fear;
Enjoying of each what’s within our reach,
With thankfulness sincere.
So as I don’t mean to come near
Your cordials and compounds queer;
Live and let live, pray; and go your own way,
But don't come between me and my beer.

THE MOUSTACHE MOVEMENT.
MASTER SMITH, AS HE APPEARED TRYING TO FORCE HIS MOUSTACHES FOR THE BROWNS PARTY.
THE CAPTURE OF BOMARSUND.
From the Invalide Russe.
BQMARSUND is a pig-sty, which, by order of the EMPEROR, whose
provident care extends over the meanest of his subjects, was fortified
with a forty-eight pounder. Foreseeing that the combined French and
English fleets would carry out the tactics they have all along pursued,
§ endeavouring to destroy this little piece of private property, the
ommander of the troops at Cronstadt sent a force of ten men, under
the command of CoRPoRAL KICKEMOFF, to defend it from invasion.
The approach of the Allied Fleets speedily demonstrated the wisdom
of these measures of precaution. As soon as they came within range,
the Corporal opened fire upon them, and quickly sank several of their
largest vessels with his single or many hours KICKEMOFF
and his gallant soldiers sustained an º combat with the French
and English under a tremendous but ill-directed shower of shot and
shells. One of the latter at last set, fire to the thatch of the fortress;
and under the cover of their guns the enemy succeeded in effecting a
landing, not however, without the loss of several hundred men who
were shot, by three riflemen of KICKEMOFF's force. As the fort, had
no outworks, its only intrenchment, lying in the hog-trough, our little
troop was ultimately overpowered by superior numbers, and made an
honourable surrender, with the loss of one, man, killed, and two
wounded, including the brave KICKEMOFF, who lost his little finger. As
the savage Britons were loading him with chains, the gallant captive
ºliſed, “Oh England, England, I hardly expected this from
you !
.The loss to the EMPEROR's service of the brave KICKEMOFF and
his intrepid band is ill ºf...; for by the destruction of nine of
the enemy's ships; but his Imperial, Majesty consoles himself with the
reflection that he has a hundred million subjects in Russia as good as
they, and has ordered a Te Deum to be sung on account of the damage
they inflicted on the enemy. The ten ships lost by the Anglo-French
were first class men-of-war, all of them having the peculiarity of being
rigged with sails of buckram.
WHO SHALL IDECIDE WHEN DOCTORS DISAGREE?
. It is really nauseating to witness the quantity of doctor's stuff...that
is allowed to run down the columns of the newspapers. It will be
necessary at last to proceed against the public press as a public
nuisance if we have much more of the “foul and offensive matter”
circulating under our noses every day at our breakfast tables to an
extent highly dangerous to the health, the patience, and the nerves of
the reading community. If the doctors who write to the papers would
agree in their prescriptions for cholera, the public might feel grateful
for the trouble taken, but when one medical man’s “infallible
medicine” is another medical man’s “deadly poison,” and the specific
of to-day is denounced as the fatal drug of to-morrow, we are puzzled
and alarmed at the risk we run in following the doctors’ contradictory
directions. The conclusion at which we have arrived is, that however
valuable the recommendation to, “let well alone,” it is still more
desirable to," let ill alone,” if a sick man is subject to be poisoned by
one or more of the numerous concoctions suggested in the newspapers
by the medical practitioner. According to Monday's paper, such and
such a dose is a sure safeguard against cholera, until 'uesdays rint
denounces the same mixture as death to all who take it. “I have
tried so and so with success,” says M.R.C.S., and “it stands to reason
so, and so must prove fatal in a few hours,” rejoins an “M.D. of
thirty years' standing.” When doctors disagree their want of unanimity
is indeed most wonderful.
Jolly Companions Every One.
A SUBSCRIPTION has been set on foot to pay the expenses of LIEUT.
PERRY's defence against his recent persecution. One of his friends
oes a little further than the rest, and says, “I would purchase for him
is company.” We doubt whether, LIEUT. PERRY, would consent to
this arrangement, for after reading the account of the insults and in-
tfusions to which he has been exposed, we have come to the conclusion
that he cannot have found either his room or his company very
agreeable.

SOME VERY PETTY SESSIONS.
oME of the Sessions held in the country
are generally termed Petty, and after
§. the annexed extract from a
that the Sessions sometimes fully de-
serve their name for Pettiness.
“AN Expensive TURNIP.—Sha Rp PRACTICE.-
Thomas Pye, a respectable young man, in the
employ of MR. SAMUEL Cohbert, Blacksmith, of
Park Street, Wellington, was charged (before
the Rev. H. BURtoN alone) with stealing a
turnip, of the value of one halfpenny, the pro-
perty of St. J. C. CHARL'ron, Esq. Defendant
was taking a walk on the footpath through the
field, with others, on Sunday evening last,
when he pulled up the turnip in question. He
was observed by John Lloyd, shepherd to
MR. CHARLtoN, and for this grave offence, de-
fendant was taken into custody and locked up
the same evening. The turnip being grubby
he threw it down again, without eating it.
Defendant expressed his contrition for the
offence. The Rev. M.R. Burton, after lecturing
the prisoner upon the serious character of the offence, and the consequent disgrace
on his employer, fined him 10s. with 3s. expenses, and a halfpenny the value of the
turnip, making a tºtal of 13s. 0}d. MR. Charlton stated that he had lost a great
number of turnips, and was determined to make an example of the first he caught.
The . was paid. During the hearing of this case MR. CHARLTon withdrew from
the bench.'
In the first place the offence—such as it was—may be termed petty
enough, though the reverend istrate, putting on the magisterial
magnifying glasses, was able to descant on its enormity. §. the
enlarged sympathies of respectability, the reverend lecturer felt less
for the culprit himself, who had to endure the punishment due to the
fl. act, than for the respectable employer, who was doomed to suffer
the disgrace of having in his employment a wretch that could pull up a
grubby turnip, and throw it down again. We commenced by saying
that the whole affair was truly petty, but we must be allowed to with:
draw the expression as far as the ; is concerned, for the amount
of the fines when compared with the offence, may be considered as the
very revºe of pettiness.

RUSSIA, the GRAND DUKE CoNstANTINE, and Dr. Thomas Cott-
MAN, seated. At the elbow of each, on a malachite table, sherry
cobbler. Cotry AN smoking a cigar with his heels elevated on the
back of a chair.
Emp. Yes, Doctor, in this world there are two forms
Of Government, and but two possible,
Your own, and ours. . You, an enlightened people,
Are capable of self-rule; each of you
A Sovereign is whose subjects are himself.
Cottm. And Niggers.
Emp. Yes; and Niggers. But our Russians,
Unripe for institutions such as yours,
As yet do need a master.
Cottm. I expect
There just this difference is 'tween you and we,
Yourn is white Niggers, Emperor, ourn is black.
You owns more slaves than we do.
Emp. Even so.
Cottm. And you and we are near about as like,
As cowhide is to knout.
Emp. And both combined—
Cottm. Will flog creation—
Grand D. And the Britishers.
Cottin. Grand Duke, you’re right. I tell you what, Grand Duke,
You talk exactly like a reg’lar Yankee,
Though in your silks you stand but five feet five,
You’d pass for one on Broadway—that’s a fact;
Now, Emperor, hand us a cigar. -
mp. Try these. (Passes cigar case.)
They’re Cubas; and although the question may
Appear superfluous—Do you smoke *
Cottm. Wal, yes,
Emperor, I rather speculate I do.
mp. Well, Doctor, now's your time to take your Cuba;
You shall do so; and I, in the meanwhile,
Will help myself to Turkey.

This physic for Papa and CoNst ANTINE *
The B. his own medicine takes, I see;
So I suppose it must be rather mice.
Cottm. Taste it, Grand Duchess.
[Offers his glass and straw.
Grand Duch. Oh how very good | [Returns
Cottm. I’ll keep that straw. I’ll never part with it :
BARNUM would give me something for the straw
Which the Grand Duchess sucked her cobbler through,
But he shan’t have it.

I will not stay and let you make me vain,
Farewell, you flattering doctor.

Cottm. Wal, good bye, Emperor, and goodbye, Grand Duke;
Your message I will take to GENERAL PIERCE.

Will lick them cussed Britishers, I hope,
Into a tarmal and immortal smash,

A REVIEWER REVIEWED.
THE Quarterly Review, in an article on the Drama, which seems to
have been written from some room in the neighbourhood of Wych
Street, commanding a view of nothing but the Olympic, says that
“with less than a cubit added to his stature MR. Robson would be the
first Shakesperian actor of his day.”. We do not quite agree, with
the Quarterly critic, who measures genius by the foot rule, and believes
that an actor may stamp himself as first-rate by the aid of high heels to
his boots. If MR. Robson requires nothing to make him a first-rate
Shakesperian performer, but a cubit, added to his stature, he had
better apply to CUBITT, the builder, who would obligingly build up his
fame by providing him with a pair of stilts. For ourselves, we are no
admirers of the stilted style which the Quarterly reviewer appears to
patronise, and we are quite satisfied to take MR. Robson as he is
without the “magnificent addition,” as the showman would call it, of
a few inches to his stature.

BRACKISH THOUGHTS.
By our Man on the Shingles (waiting in wrath for a
Bathing-Machine).
THAT snob who keeps me waiting so long, while he is
dressing after his bath, should not be judged harshly. He
is probably some counterjumper, who is usually obliged to
dress in five minutes. Perhaps, too, the machine is more
ºlious than such a wretched lodging as he can afford
O Illre.
Those women have left the water three quarters of an
hour, and are still in their machine. They are romping.
How vulgarly they laugh. Doubtless, too, they are dowdies,
and after bungling over their toilette for an age, will come
forth, blowzed and looking as if their lady's maid had been
a pitchfork; I hope they will, and thus revenge me for
being kept here.
The ass who swims worst is always the one who bawls in
the water, waddles about, splashes idiotically, and keeps
his betters out of the machine. A gentleman plunges in,
takes his swim in silence, and dresses rapidly.
Women are all cheats. Those women have cheated me
out of my turn, and the woman who keeps the machine
pretends to think it is all right. I º for her sake, that
the season will be short; and very cold.
Those ugly women who went in last would make more
haste, but they think the two pretty girls near me are
waiting, and so in sheer spite they are doing their hair here
instead of going home like ladies, and doing it in their bed
rooms. I hope they will catch colds.
How that child shrieks in fear of the sea! But I bear
the mother slapping it, and thrusting it in. And yet, they
say women are tender-hearted. I would see the little beast
at Jericho before I would expose myself to hear such noises.
There it screeches again. ... People have no right to annoy
others by causing such yells—if they must torture the brat,
why don’t they have a tub at home. -
[Here the Bathing mistress beckons him.
I don’t think it is my turn, (aside) but I’ll have it.
And as I have been kept so long, I see no reason for
treating others better, and so— -
[Enters the machine, learing his successors to think
similar thoughts for the next half hour.
LOOK OUT FOR YOUR LIBERTY.
SAID JoHN BULL's man of measures, or Tailor, to John,
“Sir, your sleeves are too short—let me put these cuffs on.”
.Cuffs?” quoth, John, “yes, they seem just like handcuffs to me,
For instead of a button they’re closed with a key:
Well; they’re not locked together—my hands are still free.”
To John BUIL said his Tailor, another fine day,
Sir, your ancles want bracing—they’re like to give way. .
§ now, let me advise you these Gaiters to wear.
Said John BULL, “Gaiters, eh? Pair of ſetters I swear,
But they’ve no bolts or shackles—and so I don't care.”
J9HN, BUIL danced in his fetters and dined in his cuffs,
Meeting all observations thereon with rebuffs,
Such as-“Don’t talk to me about being confined
I am full and am lazy, I’ve danced and I’ve dined,
Let me now go to sleep—for a nap I’m inclined.”
J9HN BULL slept, and was plunged in a slumber most sweet,
Whilst his Tailor the gaiters and cuffs did complete;
John BULL woke hand and foot irretrievably bound,
And unable to stir, being chained to the ground,
While his cries for release with stern laughter were drowned.
Sunday Bills are the handcuffs with which we begin,
On º: of preventing the evils of gin ;
To keep sots from their swill we are liquorless made,
And we suffer the Government thus to invade
Both our freedom of action and freedom of trade.
And the fetters are trammels, which soon will, unless
We look out very sharp, be imposed on the Press.
The first step its liberty destined to cramp
May be taken by some Jesuitical scamp -
With a little more rigour by pressing the Stamp.
For the Press may be º chained by degrees.
The rat has already his tusks at the cheese.
At St. Martin's Hall, lately, was heard such a rat,
All so stealthily, covertly, nibbling at that,
Underneath the broad brim of a Cardinal's hat.
To be earnest in any way—care to bestow,
Save on stomach and skin may be dreadfully slow.
'Twould be slower if we like our neighbours behaved,
With their lips all unshorn—of their liberties shayed—
And became, like the nations around us, enslaved.
OFFICERS WITNESS DRILL, OR FORTY-SIXTH EXERCISE.
THIs drill is practised in a room, which, in military phraseology, is
called the Mess Room, but to which, perhaps, with greater propriety,
might be applied the collegiate term of Combination Room. The
fellows, that is to say the officers of the regiment, having met therein,
ostensibly for the purpose of auditing the mess accounts, but really

vauxhALL IN THE sulks.
HE proprietor of Vauxhall has
shut up his gardens in a huff,
extinguished every one of his
twenty-five thousand additional
lamps, turned out his hermit
to grass, put away all the
cocked hats of the band, stowed
away Cronstadt into the shed
at the back of the Waterloo
Ground, finished the ham that
used to make the celebrated
Vauxhall slices, dismissed the
Sigmor who makes fearful as
cents amid showers of fire-
works by night,andisemployed
at the gas works by day—in
fact from Vauxhall Gardens
“The lights are fled,
The waiters dead,
And all the band departed.”
The reason for this abrupt
closing of the establishment in
a hot week of fine weather, is
set forth in a letter that ap-
peared in the Times of Monday
the 21st of August. It seems
that the proprietor in his ex-
treme eagerness to meet the
wishes and suit the tastes of
- an enlightened British public
—more than usually enlightened during the season by twenty-five thousand additional lamps-
had secured the Italian Brothers, who had bound themselves by the ties of a stringent
engagement to bind themselves to the car of a certain balloon by the stringent ties of certain
bandages fastened to their feet, by which they were to hang suspended in the air with their
heads downwards. These sons of the south had it seems made a profession and a practice
of this upside down or topsy-turvy proceeding, and they had frequently delighted a generous
British public with this imminent risk of their lives, and by permitting their existence to
hang upon a thread at a surprising altitude. It is true that there have been a few deaths
from experiments in ballooning, but this fact, it must be admitted, so far from depriving
the affair of the features of a public amusement, had tended rather to heighten the zest with
which the display was looked for by an enlightened English assembly. The police, however,
having other duties besides those of encouraging a refined taste for what certainly may be
called in one sense the highest style of art, and remembering that several deaths had
: occurred for the amusement of the British public by ballooning experiments, felt called on
to step in and interdict what we may be justified in calling this “brilliant display of assman-
ship.” The proprietor of the gardens became so indignant at this interference with an
earnest desire to “cater for the public amusement,” that he in a fit of the sulks has cut
short his season, and written a letter of indignant remonstrance to the Times newspaper.
The Italian Brothers are so shocked by the denial of their right to risk their lives, that they
have appealed to the Secretary of State, and if there were any Itálian nationality, we might
possibly be involved in a war with Italy. These remarkable specimens of suspended ani-
mation had it seems recently purchased a balloon for the more complete enjoyment of the
luxury of hanging by their ºl. to the bottom of the car, and their disgust is extreme at
finding that the words of the poet—
“I, surely, in a country that is free,
May kill myself if it so pleases me,”
are but the idle dreams of therhapsodist, and not the calm declaration of a right admitted by
the British Government. We must however be content to dispense with our evenings at
Vauxhall, for the rest of the season, and the london public must learn to bear as it best
can the deprivation of not being allowed the risk of a brace of brothers tumbling down from
a height of some thousands of feet into the middle of some public thoroughfare. Perhaps
the brothers may in their calmer moments reflect that however anxious they may be to
run the risk of pitching on their own skulls, there may be other skulls—not quite so thick
—underneath the balloon, which are not so eager to be pitched upon.
THE SUNDAY TRAVELLERS’ CLUB.
| To temper, the New Beer Bill to Sunday excursionists, it is proposed to establish an
adequate number of Travellers' Clubs; since clubs are exempt from the restrictions of that
enactment, and it allows beer to be served to travellers.
Each Club will consist of from four to six persons who, however, will have power to add
anybody, who chooses to be added, to their number. They will besides, individually, possess
the privilege of introducing a friend, or as many friends as they please, whether gentlemen or
ladies, into the Club, to enjoy a temporary participation, for an indefinite period, in the
advantages of its membership, which will include the use of any of the Club apartments, and
§. . to be supplied with any species of refreshment provided by the Club, at the usual
up prices.
. A member of the Club will be in constant attendance in the Hall, or where there is no Hall,
in the Passage, to admit visitors. The ceremony of admission will be simply that of putting
the visitor's name and address, under the denomination of Traveller, without any particular
§. to authenticity, down on a slate, which
will be suspended for that purpose against the wall.
Buildings to serve for Club Houses have been
already erected, comprising the various premises
hitherto called and known by the name and sign
of the Crown, the King's Arms, the Goose and
Gridiron, the Cat and Fiddle, and other the like
appellations.
The Club will consist of the Landlord, the
Boots, the Head Waiter, and the Ostler of the
establishment: to whom will be added other
waiters, the Štable boy, and the Landlady and
Chambermaid if necessary. The terms of sub-
scription will be One Farthing per Annum : no
entrance Fee. Visitors will not be called upon for
any subscription whatever. A smoking room will
offer its attractions in every room in the house
except the apartments reserved for private parties.
Should any legaldifficulty be thrown in the way
of the above arrangements, the Club will consti-
tute itself a regular Club, by appointing a Com-
mittee, consisting of the Boots and the Ostler,
with the Landlord for Chairman, who will be re-
sponsible for all the Club's liabilities. Anybody
will be eligible to become a member at a moment’s
notice, by being º for by the already exist-
ing members, and the requisite facilities for
prompt election will be afforded by two or more
of them attending without blackballs, at the Club
entrance. The Club will be kept open during
such hours as the convenience of the Public may
require; and to preclude the possibility of any
mistake, the words “ALL TRAVELLERs' CLUB?’
will be painted in large letters over the door.
A BALTIC BROADSIDE.

PUNCH'S OWN RAILWAY.
This snug little suburban, line occasionally
makes a mild demand on public attention, by a
sort of popgun-like proceeding known as the
issuing of its .." report, which is usually
º with a very little smoke, and some.
what ſess fire. Everything is on the smallest

| garden roller, which is kept for the purpose of
rolling the gravel walks the side of those
| cabbage beds which form the vegetable wealth
of the Company. The property of the railway is
understood to have somewhat increased; but
there has been a loss of one engine and two
buffers-the former being the moral, engine
which the Company once possessed in the sup-
port, of a now apathetic press; and the latter
consisting of two old buffers who have got better
places, after having been for some years in the
service of the line as gardeners.
The balance at the bankers' has been aug-
mented by a few pounds, and the goods traffic is
nearly eight ounces more this year than it was
last—an increase which, considering the level of
former times, may be considered feverish. Of
coals there is a scuttle more in the Company’s
cellars than there was in 1853; and the Directors
purpose that this surplus shall not be disturbed,
but that it shall be added to the “rest,” and
carried over to the credit—the very great credit
—of the Company. -
The engineer of the line has inspected, the
boilers, and reports that “the concern is not yet
out of hot water, nor likely to be for some time
to come:” nor have the law proceedings been
brought to a termination. Thanks were voted

SANCTIFIED SLANDER UPON PUNCH.
A writer, who appears to be an adept in the pseudosophy of Cant,
has been perpetrating an article, whence the following is an extract,
in the English Journal of Education:—
“There are two very clear dangers to which boys are liable to be exposed on a
Sunday. The first is the very palpable and glaring one of temptation to forget that it
is a holy day as well as a holiday. It is very sad and grievous to think of the shock
that a young boy's moral system must receive when he emerges from the too tightly
laced apron-strings of a religious home into the atmosphere which hails the day on
which our Lord overmastered Death with the broadsheet of Bell's Life, Punch, the
| loose morals of Reynolds, and other worse than worthless literature.”
The Journal that admitted the foregoing remarks may call itself the
English Journal of Education, but, as far at least as they go, it is, in
the strongest sense, un-English. The unhappy Scribe, and Pharisee,
who penned those illiterate and absurd"observations, represents a boy
as emerging from apron-strings, as if apron-strings were the ocean, or a
river, or pond, or other receptacle containing fluid in which it was
ssible for the youth to have been plunged. We should like to see
im emerge, himself, from the sink of folly and impertience, at the
bottom of which he now flounders. In the meantime he may con-
tribute to the public amusement by explaining how a home, religious
or profane, can wear an apron, and how the strings of any apron,
whether worn by a home or a housemaid, or even a bishop, can be laced,
unless by being adorned with lace. Also by stating the composition
of that atmosphere which is capable of hailing a day otherwise than by
hailing for twenty-four hours, and which must consist of other and
very different elements than oxygen and nitrogen, with an admixture of
aqueous vapour and carbonic acid. Further, given an atmosphere that
can hail a day, without a hailstorm, by showing how the atmosphere
desecrates the day by hailing it with Punch ; a work which shocks no
moral system but a weak one, and, like electricity, shocks only to in-
vigorate that.
So far from containing aught calculated to shock the moral system of
a boy, these º: are characterised by a scrupulous reverence for
childhood, as this person, who abuses them, would know if he had ever
read them. One would think that the “atmosphere” which he is in
the habit of breathing is one of very strong tobacco-smoke and fumes
of beer, whereof the effect has been to muddle his understanding and
confuse his style. A man must be in a very extreme state of pipes
and ale to commit such a wretched attempt at a pun as that involved
in the antithesis of holy day and holiday—a pun betraying a peculiar
disregard of DR. Johnson. If the punster is not capable of picking
a pocket, he is evidently quite capable of robbing others of their
good name.
We will not “shock” the feelings of our readers by more than
alluding to the equivocal construction consequent on the misplacement
of the preposition “with ” in the concluding sentence of the paragraph
above quoted. We advise the professor of education to educate himself
before he puts any more of his discourses into print, and should recom-
mend him, for the present, to deliver them only from his pulpit, which
we would suggest might consist of a cinder-heap in a low reighbour-
hood, if the man were fit to preach anywhere.

A FINALE TO AN OPERA.
HAT the annexed finale
may be understood, it
will be necessary that
the following explana-
tory argument should
attention.
The action of the
# Drury Lane, and opens
with a grand
tre having just been
* taken by a bold and
tº enterprising chief, at
§ the head of a very gal:
º lant band, who had
consented to become
instrumental—and vo-
their leader, the popu-
lace are seen rushing
forward with eager
curiosity, and they re-
cognise in Caradori-
the heroine—an Italian
lady, whose talents had
- - already excited admira-
tion and interest. Everything proceeds merrily for some time, and large masses of
people are seen advancing with contributions of gold and silver, till a slight
murmur of discontent arises in consequence of a mysteriºus demand from the
director—a dark figure in the back-ground—of an increase of twelvepence a head
from a certain section of the contributors. This throws a gloom over the scene,
which is scarcely dispelled by the appearance of Parési, a yºung Italian tenor,
who is destined to become the hero of what is to follow. We have omitted to
allude to the part taken by a German of imposing aspect, and considerable power,
who, under the well known name of Formes, had entered on the scene, and by the
influence of his voice and character—or characters, for he could assume several
—had partly reconciled the people to pay the increased tax which the director
—the dark figure in the back-ground—had imposed.
The Second Act opens rather cheerlessly in a sort of desert with a large ther-
mometer standing at 80 in the shade, and a number of liveried box-keepers openin
the doors of vacant boxes for the admission of what little air may be waſte
through every gaping aperture. A burning heat gives languor to the whole band,
and throws a damp—in the shape of perspiration—on the countenanges of all
concerned. The Second Act soon comes to a close, the curtain itself dropping
from mere exhaustion.
The Third Act opens in a Jew Attorney’s Office, with a sort of March;
diabolique, which conducts to the scene of the Judges' Chambers, where a concerted
piece ensues, introducing the taking of the oath and the issuing of the writ; con-
*inding with a Chorus of Tipstaves, who proceed to the abodes of Caradori
and Faces. In the next Sºme we find the heroine and the hero locked—not
in each other's arms—but in the Maison d’éponge, or Sponging House, to which
they have been consigned, by certain machinations, in which a regular machinist
ls iº. to have taken part. After some rather mysterious action in what is
called a carpenter's scene, the stage represents the Police Court at Bow Street,
and the finale begins. Enrico, a Podesta, is seated on the Bench ºf Justice, sur-
rounded by his officers, and at the Bar stands Il Falegname, who had taken the
oathin the previous scene. In the foreground are two lawyers, both bearing the
name of Luigi, but belonging to different houses; one representing the much-
º: Casa Luigi Piazza d’Eli, near the celebrated"Giardino dº Hattone,
and the other being Luigi della Piazza d'Oro, or Golden Square.
The Finale commences with a striking piece of Recitative by Luigi della Casa,
who informs Enrico, the Podesta, that Caradori, the heroine, has been placed
in captivity on the oath of Il Falegname, who swore that she was about to depart
for Germany in Il Falegnane's debt. The following is the text of a portion of this
grand Recitative:- *
'Twas at dread midnight's sad and awful hour
She fell within the Sheriff's deadly power
The victim of an oath—which had averre
She owed a debt of which she’d never heard.

CORONERS AND RAILWAY COMPANIES. .
(Specially Reported.)
AN investigation into the causes of the last accident (but eleven) |
which took place on the Grand Indirect East and West Junction Rail-
way, was held before MR. CoroneR CRINGE and a select jury, at the
Buffalo's Arms, Wapshot, on Tuesday last. It will be remembered
that upon the occasion in question an express train ran into an excur-
sion train, and that four carriage-fulls of passengers were either
destroyed or mutilated. The interests of the sufferers or their
executors were represented by M.R. Pounce, a solicitor; while MR.
BLUSTER, Q.C., and MR. SNARL, of the common-law bar, attended on
the part of the railway company. The public was unrepresented, the
law officers of the Crown having special retainers in private cases,
which made their attendance, for which the country pays them only a
general retainer, impossible upon the present occasion.
The CoRoNER opened the proceedings by addressing the jury. He
must begin by stating that the conduct of the Grand Indirect East and
West Junction Railway Company did them the highest credit. They
were disposed to court the very fullest investigation, and, although it
might not be strictly within his judicial knowledge, he must add that
the first-class carriages on the line were most comfortable, and the
station-masters were among the most genteel and polite young men he
had ever seen. That, however, did not exactly bear upon the present
inquiry, which was, how this unlucky accident had occurred to vary
the usual regularity and safety of the excellent and admirable line in
question.
MR. BLUsTER begged to remind the Coroner that he, MR. B., and
not the CoRoNER, was the advocate of the Company.
The CoRoNER was aware of that, and was quite sure that the usual
sound discretion exercised by the Company had dictated their choice
of counsel. -
The first witness, HENRY BATTER, was called. . He said that on
Tuesday last he was a passenger by the excursion train from Diddleton.
At 6:30 they passed the Hangmansleigh Station, and were going at a
wretched pace—
The Coron ER cautioned the witness not to use injurious expressions.
The train might be going more slowly than the witness liked, but
surely a noble Company like that of the Grand Indirect knew better
than the witness what pace to keep.
The Witness, in continuation, said that they were going not more than
thirteen miles an hour.
The CoRoNER said that this showed the prudence and caution of
the Company. As it was, the pace was faster than that of the best
stage coach of former days. How much had the witness paid P
WITNEss.-Thirteen-and-sixpence.
The CoRoNER (with indignation).-What! To come ninety miles!
And with such generous liberality on the part of the Company, the
witHess had the baseness to complain of the pace | He thought, after
such a display of character, it would be for the jury to consider what
weight to attach to the witness's evidence.
e Witness said that he paid what was asked, and believed that
by law the Company undertook to convey him speedily and safely. He
certainly did not accept the contract on the understanding that he was
to take the chances of a smash,
The CoRONER **'. him into custody for speaking so
flippantly of a great public body, and expressed a conviction that the
* would be as much disgusted as he was.
AURA MoULD was then called. She deposed to the fact that she
had been travelling by the excursion train, and as they came crawling
up to the Hangmansleigh Station—
The CoRoNER.—Don’t say crawling, woman. Beetles crawl. As
the train was proceeding at a comparatively slow pace—well ?
Witness adhered to the word crawling, and despite all the remon-
strances of the Coroner, who entreated her to consider what a splendid
institution the railway was, and how much the public were indebted to
the spirited and wealthy gentlemen who managed it, she would use no
other word. The Coroner was obliged, therefore, to record his protest,
and to take her evidence, that while the excursion train was lagging
three quarters of an hour late, the express ran into it, and caused
terrible damage.
Seventeen other witnesses deposed to the same fact, and despite the
Coroner's cautions, inveighed bitterly against the mismanagement of
the railway.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 95
The signal man of the Hangmansleigh Station gave evidence that he
was underpaid and overworked, and admitted that he was too tired and
too sleepy to make the danger signal. He had no doubt that, had it
been made, the express train would have stopped.
The CoRoNER, after reading him a severe lecture upon his ingratitude
in speaking in that brutal manner of the Company which gave him
bread, directed that he should be t-ken into custody.
Several witnesses, conversant with railway matters, desired to be
examined, but the CoRoNER said that he did not see what good they
could do. The last witness had shown how the accident occurred.
The Jury said that the evidence was insufficient. The signal man
was in fault, but why was the train so late 2
The CoRoNER was sorry to see that the vulgar prejudice against
railway management extended to that box. They ought to be above
tlemen had anything to º:
MR. PCUNGE said that the Railway Company had been proved guilty
of two unpardonable offences, and he hoped that the verdict of the jury
would convince them that no Railway Directors, any more than any
other tradesmen, could be allowed to cheat their customers. They
offered good and swift conveyance, for money; they sold bad and slow
fºunce and when compensation was demanded, they began to
ull.W. |
The CoRoNER, who had several times interrupted the solicitor, now
ordered him out of Court. |
The hired representatives of the company said that they had intended
to speak, but were quite content to leave the advocacy of their clients
in the hands of the judge. - - - |
The CoRoNER summed up. Railways were a glorious invention,
and this line was one of the best specimens we possessed. It scarcely
ever killed anybody. Why, the population of Great Britain at the
census of 1851 was 20,936,468 persons; and how few of those the
Grand Indirect East and West Junction had destroyed The number
was a trifle, compared to that of those who travelled, or might, if they
liked, travel on the line. Moreover he was quite sure that the directors
were most sorry when any casualty occurred. Most of the witnesses
had given their evidence in a very unbecoming manner, and therefore
it was valueless. On the whole, therefore, he thought—of course the
jury would judge for themselves—that the company were quite free
from blame in the matter.
The Jury, without retiring, returned a verdict of “Manslaughter º
against the i)irectors of the Company, adding a strong expression of
disgust at the system they had sanctioned. -
The CoRoNER said that they must be mad. He should record no
such cruel and oppressive verdict.
The Jury insisting, he was compelled to yield, but appended a written
apology to the Company for being the unwilling agent in insulting them
so shamefully.
MR. Bºstºk was quite sure that the Company were aware of the
CoRoNER's feelings. The inquiry then terminated.

DEAR GEORGE, this white jug, mixed with ADAM's mild ale,
(That’s the stingo for toasting your NAN of the Wale)
Holds what once was GoBBLE, a greedy old soul
Who mopped up the turtle-soup, bowl after bowl,
In †† 'twas also his wont to excel,
And at all civic dinners he’d feed till he fell.
It chanced as in Guildhall he gorged by degrees,
Eating all sorts of messes, as rich as you please,
At the custards and pastry whilst pegging away,
And with brandied brown sherry well soaking his clay,
His steam-valves of life on a sudden were shut,
And he went, blowing up like an engine—all but.
In ground intramural when long he had lain,
Resolved into salts, earths, and gases again,
Ammonialeaked into a well near him dug,
And so part of old GobbLE got into this jug ;
Now held in solution by ADAM’s mild ale,

Theatrical Note and Query.

G †-There is a little book recently published, called “The Buxton
uide.”
Query-Now, what Buxton? Is this not, pray, an indirect method of
announcing the i. Dancers, for we know of no other Guide just at
present that is taking all the people to Buckston E *
such nonsense. He would close the inquiry, unless the learned gen. this dangerous substance in any localit

MAINE MODEL LAw.
THE frequent occurrence of accidents from fire-arms at this season of
the year suggests the question whether it would not be possible, at the
cost of a little self-denial to a portion of the public, to prevent these
deplorable casualties altogether. •
The means by which this desirable purpose might, there is every
reason to believe, be fully accomplished, would be the prohibition of the
manufacture and sale of gunpowder for any purposes but those of
Government.
It is true that we are not as yet in possession of any statistical facts
tending to show that abridgement of the facilities for the purchase of
- has been attended by a pro-
portionate decrease of the deaths, mutilations, and other bodily injuries
arising from its incautious use on an average during a given period in
that locality. Official and other returns, however, have clearly estab-
lished that a decided diminution of cases of drunkenness on Sundays
has attended the partial restrictions, which have been imposed on
hastily to a conclusion to infer that, if no such drinks were allowed to
be sold at all, the result would be a very general, if not a total, ces-
sation of inebriety. If this inference be allowed, it must also be
admitted that the analogous measure of putting a stop to the trade in
an explosive compound would at least greatly limit the frequency of
explosions. -
The Maine" Liquor Law is said to answer well; and many ons
are of opinion that a similar law would answer equally well here.
|Unquestionably. So would a Gunpowder Law; a law forbidding all
dealings in Gunpowder. Let us have such a law then; the sooner the
better. Why not put that “villanous saltpetre” under a ban as well
as that pernicious alcohol? How many an existence has been em-
bittered for life; how many a family has been bereaved of its only sup-
ort;, how many wives, sisters, children, have had to mourn the
rightful and fatal consequences which legislation, by intercepting their
cause, might have rendered impossible!
What valid reason can be assigned for the practice of shooting?. It
is notorious that partridges, pheasants, hares, nay woodcocks, and snipe,
may be easily procured, for the purposes of the table, by catching them
in nets and snares, or simply knocking them on the head as they lie.
As to the plea that the sport affords healthful exercise, surely the same
amount and kind of exercise might be taken by walking through
heath, turnips, and stubble, or over ploughed fields, with a large stick
instead of a gun. The mere exhilaration attendant on the act of
striking, down a bird on the wing, or a quadruped running, doubtless
will be cheerfully resigned when it is considered how great a preservation
of human life and limb will be the reward of the sacrifice.
As the principle gains ground of legislating to prevent the misuse or
the abuse of a thing by interdicting its use, it will perhaps come to be
considered whether we had not better abolish penknives, because they
sometimes cut fingers, and are no longer necessary now that we have
steel pens. The moustache movement also will be rendered imperative
on the part of every man, since it is possible to get on well enough
without shaving, but that, operation cannot be performed without
razors, and everybody will be precluded from obtaining those instru-
ments because some persons, if they got them, would commit suicide
with them. Laws will ultimately be passed for depriving us of the
ability to gratify any inclination which can be sº improperly—in
which case ji we any longer be men to thrash the Russians, or
even to render the sort of service which we are now rendering to
the Turks?

WE hope Miss FREDRIKA, BREMER will abandon her design of
getting up a Ladies' Peace Society. An association composed of such
elements might exert a most dangerous influence. Suppose Miss
BREMER could succeed in inducing the generality of the young ladies
of England to form a confederacy devoted to the prevention of war.
Imagine one of its rules to be that every member should take a pledge,
or enter into a solemn engagement, never to accept an invitation to
dance at an evening party with an officer. The consequence would be
that we should want chiefs to lead our troops to battle. Thus de-
prived of national defences, we should fall an easy prey to Russia, or
any other invader. -

lory? This is no object to the ſº of Englishmen; moreover
the chance of winning it is too slight to operate, in any considerable
degree, as an incentive. Gain? Now that clothing colonels are
abolished, an officer has no opportunity of thriving, and if he has only
his pay to depend upon, he is poorly off indeed. short, to any indi-
vidual of common sense, and ordinary ideas, there is no temptation to
accept, a commission, much less to purchase one, except the preference
§ the fair sex to military men over civilians. But for the pre-
ilection evinced by the female taste for a man in a red coat, hardly
anybody but a clown would put on a garment of that colour, unless for
the chase, or in the capacity of general postman. If Miss BREMER
could contrive to persuade British Beauty to refuse its hand in the
thé dansant and the soirée to British valour, we should very soon be
hard up for Ensigns and Lieutenants, next for Captains and Majors, in
no long time for Colonels, and should ultimately be destitute . every
single General and Field Marshal.

of filtered water that they will have nothing to do with Vesuvius, or
Etna, or Hecla, or any other disreputable mountain that is known
ºr. by the violent eruptions that take place on its brow, and the
earful explosions that issue at times from its flaming mouth—for such
exhibitions would only be colouring a wrong moral, for we are well aware
they are but the aggregate result of repeated drops of the “crater.”

! A LovER or Avon's Swan wishes to know whether we
TO CORRESPONDENTS.
JABosh.-In reply to your inquiries as to the period of
the siege of Troy, the weight of the Elephant that was
shot in Exeter Change, the amount of the imports and
exports in 1703, and other interesting historical queries,
we must refer wou to one of our Sunday contemporaries,
who, in his Notices to Correspondents, is steadily
reprinting (we trust under MR. Moxon's sanction)
HAYDN’s “Dictionary of Dates.”
A FIANC#E.—We think that he had a right to look
sulky, and had we been in his place, and you had said
so to us, we should have refused to stay to supper,
unless you had asked us very prettily indeed. |
AMAx's OpEnE inquires whether “music" be really “the |
food of love"—we do not know, but it always inspires
us with the love of food, as our correspondent shall
see if he will invite us to oysters after a Huguenots
night.
A Dounter.—The Hebrew word means, in its primitive
signification, a carpet-bag, and is so used by the Tal-
mudists. But by gradual deduction, it has now come
to mean Spanish liquorice, and you can interpret it in
whichever sense is least inconvenient to your feelings.
The Bishop of London and the Puseyites take the first
meaning, and therefore travel with portmanteaus only.
The Independents and the Irvingites take the second,
and, when they have coughs, will eat only horehound
and alicampane. But, after all, what does anything
mean? Words, if spoken, are but air, and what is
the air? Oxygen, nitrogen, and a little carbonic acid
gas. Will you be slave to a chemist's bottle?
Jocula R.—We must decline “dressing up" your “funny
anecdote" about the old bachelor who was so averse to
making a declaration, that when he became a bankrupt
he would not declare a dividend. We receive tons of
such “jokes" every week, to the great advancement
of our credit at the cheesemonger's.
PHILIDoR Juvenis.-The white king may not castle at
chess, the black only having that privilege, by the new
rule of the Paris club. While the white knight is on
a black square, a pawn must not take him, and the
same rule applies with the black knight on a white
square. At the Palace, and in the highest circles, it is
not etiquette for a bishop to give check to the queen,
but this rule is not of universal adoption.
Miss Angelica S. N. puts a difficult question. Her
elder sister is engaged, but ANGELICA, on calm reflec-
tion, thinks that the young man would suit her better
than the present object of his affections. She is solely
guided by a view to her sister's happiness, and wishes
to know how to break off the proposed match, and
secure the gentleman for herself, without causing any
unpleasantness in the family.—We will think over it—
meantime, as ANGELICA is invited to spend a month in
Paris, by all means let her go.
V. L. P.'s obliging offer to give us some “smart satirical
shows-up” of the “would-be genteel people” among
the lawyers and tradesfolk of his.town (in Montgomery-
shire) is declined without thanks.
A. WHITE LILY-Indeed, Miss, we shall not tell you
where the best rouge is to be bought. But we will
tell you where it is to be got for nothing, and that
is in Kensington Gardens, from 8 to 10 A.M., but you
must go every morning, walk briskly, and think over
passages in your Punch.
GRAccHUs wishes to serve his country in some way which
will bring him into notoriety, but he has conscientious
him make his way into Russia, penetrate to St. Peters- |
burg, and paste the last twenty of our large cuts along
objections to fighting. We respect his ambition and
his scruples, and will endeavour to meet both. Let
the front of the Palace on the Neva, with explanations
in the Russian language. We undertake to give, from
the St. Petersburg Gazette, a faithful account of his
execution.
WILLIAM CRANKY inquires whether, as we are at war,
the Postmaster General is obliged to read all the
letters that are put into the post-offices before he allows
them to be forwarded.—Such is the rule, but there is,
we regret to say, an aristocratic evasion of it.
CANNING reads only the sealed letters, MR. Rowland
Hill peruses all with adhesive envelopes, while the
wafered ones are examined by MR. Tilly. Copies of
all letters are made, and Lord PALMERstox keeps
them under his seat in the House of Commons, in order
to be ready to answer questions about them. The
number is about 360 millions a year.
A Young WIFE has got into a scrape through taking the
advice of a female pretended friend, who is now dis-
covered to be deceitful, and who persuaded her to run in
debt at a millimer's, unknown to her husband, who
has always been very kind. The millimer presses for
money. The friend advises her being kept quiet out
of the next cheque for housekeeping, and offers to
manage the casting-up the bills.-We advise the wife
to tell her husband what she has told us, and to add
that we command him not to be angry with her, and
we also advise that “not at home” be the answer for
the future whenever the “friend" calls.
HoRATIus (Southend) inquires whether there is any
companion work to the Whole Duty of Man, entitled
the Whole Duty of Woman. We are not aware of it,
but the latter might be described in a single word—
Buttons.
Lohn
can tell him the name of the sailor's wife who had
chesnuts in her cap, and ate them in such an unlady-
like manner. We have written to SIR JAMEs GRAHAM,
the First Lord of the Admiralty, and he has made MR.
tº ERNAL Osborne search the records of the Navy for
us. The woman's husband was Master of the Tiger,
and he went to Aleppo, in the year 972, that of DUN-
cAN's murder. He was much distressed on the voyage
for want of sleep. His name was Thox. As Jon Es, and
his wife's Christian name, as appears by her signature
to the receipt for his pay, was SARAH.
MATILDA is in service, and complains that because one of
the daughters of the house is named MatildA, the
mistress insists on the domestic being called ANNE.
A young attorney's clerk, who lodges in the attics,
says she can bring an action against the lady for
taking away her good name.—We recommend a com-
promise: let our fair correspondent withdraw her
MATILDA, and the lady her ANNE, and let the daughter
and the clerk be joint referees and settle on a third
name for her—say ARABELLA, or SAL.
LoRD FREDERIC B– is informed that we do not settle
sporting queries, but that we believe the length of the
course on which the Derby is run, is eighteen miles
and a half, and that no competing horse must be over
fifteen years of age. When it is said a horse “loses a
plate,” it means that he has not won the cup, vase, or
whatever the prize piece of plate may be. A handicap
is so called from its being easy to put on and take off.
A STUNNER sends us some sketches which he calls
“suggestions for sea-side shirts." We have an objec-
tion, ourselves, to wearing pictorial linen, but, for the
benefit of enterprising manufacturers, we will mention
that our correspondent desires the Brighton shirt to
bear a large view of the Pavilion; the Margate gar-
ment a neat representation of the old jetty with the
new one crawling over it; while the article for use at
Herne Bay is to shºw a pier about three miles long,
with a single plethoric policeman at the end of the
vista. The effect would certainly be very snobbish,
but not more so than the horses, foul anchors, dancers,
sculls, and cricket tools, still admired by gents.
A PROUD YouNG Moth ER is informed that Mr. Punch
never stands godfather to any darling whatever, no
matter how angelic and unparalleled. The Royal
children are the exception to this rule, and are so, be-
cause in standing sponsor at the Palace, he is simply
discharging one of his functions as an institution of the
country.
Sophia's handwriting is about the worst we ever saw, not
even excepting that of our own contributors. We do
not profess to judge characters from autographs, but
since Sophi A insists, we should say that she was cross,
idle, selfwilled, and uninformed, had red hair, wore
her dresses badly made, slapped her little brothers and
sisters, and came down to breakfast with her red hair
in curl papers. To her inquiry whether we think she
would make a happy wife, we reply that we don't know,
but we think she would decidedly make an unhappy
husband.
PART1crps CRIMINIs helped to steal a sausage-roll from a
pastrycook's shop in the year 1827, when he, P. C., was
a little boy. He has been haunted by remorse ever
since, and desires us to suggest some penance for his
crime. We submit that with his present advanced
views of what is nasty, he had better steal another, and
eat it.
INDEPATIgAntle.—It is not ungrammatical to say “him
and me see them as they was a coming,” but it is more
elegant to frame the sentence differently, and we doubt
the accuracy of your assertion that the phrase as above
is to be found in MR. MacAULAY's History of England.
Joculus Esurrens.—We believe there is such a book,
but its more proper title would have been “Jokes I
Ought to have put a Pen Through.”
A Miser ABLE WIFR had better have signed herself “A
justly punished Offender.” She deserves to lose her
husband's affection if she gives him such dinners as
she describes. He allows her plenty of housekeeping
money, and yet she is weak and criminal enough to
expect that he will come home to mutton chops, alter-
nated by steaks. The plea that she lives in a large
house, and that the servants have quite enough to do
withou their time being taken up in "finlkin' cooking"
(as the coarse-minded woman puts it.) is almost worse
than the offence. We hope that her husband will con-
tinue to accept every invitation he receives, besides
dining at his club when not asked elsewhere, until the
woman buys a cookery book and condescends to mind
the business to which she bound herself at the altar.
NABob.-We are not sure that we quite understand the
legal question as you state it. Is it thus? Your
grandfather, having no right to a house,devised it to his
uncle-in-law, in trust for the direct heirs of his cousin,
with remainder over to the collateral representatives
of his father, who died without issue. So far all is
clear. But levying the fine and suing out the super-
negit would not have barred the outstanding term, and
given the certificate in bankruptcy the force of an
escheat in tail male, unless you or your father, had
ejected the rightful owner, and caused his tenants to
attorn. The fact that you tried to do this, and were
kicked out of the house, is not a material fact in the
case. Consult a notary public.
CoLoREL Sibthorp.–The joke about a pear (pair) being
two pears has been made before.
A Bro INNER had better leave off while he is safe. He
asks us a poetical conundrum founded upon an Irish
Melody: “Why is a retired doctor like hearts that once
beat high for praise? Because he feels the pulse Lo
more.”
Jesulticus DRAMATICU's says that he is convinced that
the Stage is a mischievous institution, and that to
encourage it with money would be wrong. But he
thinks there can be no harm in going to the theatre
with an order, and therefore asks us to forward him
one. If he will come to the corner of Bride Court, on
Monday morning next, at ten o'clock, he can wait there
until we send the order out to him, unless the police
remove him.
DENTIFRice.—We believe that diamond dust makes very
good tooth-powder. Any respectable jeweller will give
you a pint or so on your applying civilly, or you may
get it from the Keeper of the Crown Jewels, at the
Tower, for a small fee. Saturating the powder with
cod liver oil (pale), makes the friction more pleasant.
A.S.S. writes on behalf of himself and some friends who
have had a dispute as to the ceremony of presentation
at Court.—It is simple. After rising from your knee,
you stand out in the circle, and PRINCE Albest (whose
good taste is celebrated) notices any portion of the
dress of the presented party, lady or gentleman, which
he sees pleases HER MAJEsty. H. R. H. inquires
where it was bonght. It is etiquette to be prepared
with cards of all the tradesmen who have furnished
your attire, and you hand in the proper one to the Mis-
tress of the Robes, mentioning the price. Then you
pass on. The cards not used are the perquisite of the
Bishop of London.
Two LITTLE PERIwinkles.—Not ladylike, but not de-
serving the harsh censure and chastisement you
describe. On another occasion, when you see a young
respectable nobleman walking past your window, and
you desire to make his acquaintance, throw something
more graceful than a coal at him to attract his atten-
tion. Your mamma and papa may be too exacting, but
remember your duty, and if you make faces in reply to
their strictures, never do so while the servant is in the
room. It is small matters that make the lady.
J. FlamARK (Penzance).-You are perfectly right in say-
ing that the bolting of anyone out prevents his bolting
in—that the purchasing on tick is frequently tic doulou-
reux—that there is nothing so touchy as touch-paper—
and that Nicholas makes his nobles "bleed" to pro-
vide the “sinews" of war, and the observations do
honour to your head and heart. Could you oblige us
again 2
ADELINE.-You must return either his affection or his
presents, but we cannot advise you as to which you
should do, unlèss we know what the latter are worth.
Do not be in a hurry. A marriage licence costs two
pounds fifteen, a divorce a thousand pounds. Draw
your own inference.
WILLIAM Sawerncle.—With practice and study we
have no doubt that you will become the first poet of the
day. But you have not yet attained that distinction,
although your verses are very sweet and pretty. The
following—all we have room for-breathe a natural
spirit of chastened affectionateness:
“Bid me quaff the cup of p(o)ison,
Bid me seek the deadly Upas,
But I still must keep my ey-s on
You, my radiant fair, when you pass!
Burl me from the height of Snowdon,
Dash me from Plinlymmon's brow,
Still I’ll bellow as I go down,
That I love you then as now.”
MARY MARIA MARGARET-Despair of being married?
Don't be such a little silly. Thirty-seven last Decem-
ber, and no offers. What of that 2 Perhaps you may
may have thirty-seven offers before next December.
What are you like? Send us your picture, and par-
ticulars as to the amount of your fortune. We'll
take care of you. Bless you. Not be married l Bosh!
Bah Bo!
QUEstionER º Buddhists are a sect of
Oriental religionists who offer the buds of roses, and
other flowers, as sacrifices. The Anabaptists are so
called from their founder, ANNA BAPTER, who died
1729. The Paedobaptists, take their name from pedes
(Lat.) “feet,” because they stamp with their feet during
service time. We never heard of the other sect you
mention, the Humguffins, but no doubt truth and error
are mingled in their teaching.
Othen CoMMUNICATIons Received.—X. V.Y. (we should
think he was, “rather").-Mod Est JANE (hit him

A MOCK JENKINS AT THE PALACE.
JENKINs is weak enough—even though his be sometimes an “amiable
weakness” and means no harm—but a mock JENKINs is in literature
what mockery would be to mock-turtle in the world of soups, or imi-
tation Walker in the region of sham champagnes. We regret to
perceive that there are several imitation JENKINSEs, whom we can only
compare to a species of mocking bird flitting about the columns of
the newspaper press. They are seen perching sometimes on the window:
sills of the palace, and sometimes on the area railings of the houses of
the nobility, and after picking up what they can they hop off to the
offices of some of the ºjº fashionable journals. This feathered
tribe will often indulge in such hoaxes as would entitle them to rank
as “humming-birds,” and we are disposed to believe that the qualities
of the “humming-bird” are displayed in a recent account of some
alleged festivities at Osborne on PRINCE ALBERT's birthday.
We are told, that on the occasion spoken of, there were “jumping in
sacks, wheeling barrows blindfolded,” and other fooleries, to which the
name of “Rural old English Sports”, is usually given. “ Among the
rest” we are told there were several candidates for a prize, “who
had their hands fastened behind them, and the task was to bring forth,
from tubs of meal, money thrown, therein, with their mouths.” The
report adds, that “as they raised their heads covered with flour, their
ludicrous appearance created roars of laughter.” Now, as the regular
Court Newsman says nothing of all this, and as the great original
JENKINs is silent on the subject, we must regard the whole affair
as a weak invention of the Mock JENKINs, who has lately got. posses-
sion of the penny-a-liner’s “flimsy.” . We cannot believe that “jumping
in sacks,” the fun of which consists in the probability that the jumpers
may fall and receive some personal damage, can have been provided as
“adainty dish to set before the QUEEN” on PRINCE ALBERT's birthday,
nor do we think that. HER MAJESTY would have looked on with de-
light at the disgusting exhibition of a number of degraded beings
trying to lick up filthy lucre by the still more filthy process of digging
their tongues into sacks of flour.
We have no doubt there are always about the court a sufficient
number of mealy-mouthed people, without adding to the quantity by
the nasty process of plunging a variety of mouths into a sack of meal
in the very presence of the Sovereign and her family. We can only
say that if such “sports” were really provided on the occasion, the
aster of the Revels seems to be as much behind the taste of the age
as he is, no doubt, behind that of the Royal lady whose ..".
hoped to propitiate.
NEW NAMES FOR THE NAVY.
With considerable pleasure we see from the Times that—
“The greatest activity prevails in our dockyards. Several line-of-battle ships have
lately been laid down, and are already in an advanced stage of forwardness.”
When these ships are launched, we º: it will be the duty of the
Government to officiate as godfather, and as we are decidedly of those
who think there’s something in a name, notwithstanding SHAKspere's
purely nominal objection, we would *:::: that the style of naval
nomenclature in use hitherto should be discarded as being now com-
pletely out of date and inappropriate. It is proverbially advised that
we should “call a spade a spade,” and such bellicose titles as the
Bulldog, the Terrible, the Wengeance, or the Fury, sound to us imposing
only in the sense of make-pretence. The peaceful war policy of our
º Government would, we think, be indicated far more correctly
y such names as the Lamb, the Reluctant, the Forbearance, the Harm-
less, and our ships would thus no longer be sailing under false titles, as
seems to be the case, especially in the Black Sea, just at present.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE EMPEROR NICHOLAS.
(As PAINTED BY DR. Cottmax.)
His simple pure-
minded man has
i. most shame-
fully libelled. From
a º intercourse
with his Imperial
Majesty—from hav-
ing eaten, smoked,
and played at
scratch-cradle with
him for many a year
—I am fortunately
enabled to give some
interesting particu-
lars of his life, which
have never before
been published. . .
To give a motion
of his extreme sim-
plicity, I will endea-
vour to sketch the
programme of his
occupations for one
day, and really his
habits ..". so little,
that the description
of one day may fairly
do duty for all.
The EMPEROR
rises at six-nºver
a minute later—
he takes but one
cup of cocoa for
his breakfast, and
he boils it himself
with a “Bachelor's
kettle.” . If it is raining, he makes up his accounts of the previous day,
but if it is fine, he goes into the garden, and pulls the garden roller
about for an hour. At a quarter past eight he rings the bell for the
servants, never disturbing them before that time. His moustache
generally takes him till nine. His mornings are mostly passed in
his dressing-room. He sees that his razors are in good trim, gives his
diamond boxes a rub or two, or else looks over his shirts and collars,
for the EMPERoR mends all his own linen. After that he waters his
flowers, of which he is passionately fond, or amuses himself by whistling
“the Russian Hymn” to a Fº bullfinch that he has educated him-
self. His private room, in fact, is crowded with objects of natural
history. It is a small menagerie. . There is scarcely a square inch of
space that is not occupied by a glass globe, or a cage, or a kennel of
some sort. It is, difficult to pick your way across the room without
treading on a rabbit, or a squirrel, or a guinea pig, or knocking down a
canary cage with your hat. Parrots threaten to É. you on all sides—
little puppies j kittens crawl up your legs at every step...The
EMPEROR will pass hours among these favourites, playing with them,
feeding them out of his own hand, scratching their “pretty polls,” or
teaching them some curious trick. In this way he has brought up a
pet spider that answers to its name—he has taught a French poodle to
strike a lucifer, light a pipe, put it into its mouth, and begin smoking
it—and still more wonderful, he has succeeded in training an byster,
(an English native) that follows him all over the house.
These amusements occupy the EMPEROR till luncheon, which is just
as simple as his other .. A small cup of tapioca with a dash of
sherry in it, or else a small slice of toast and caviare, washed down with
a glass of goat's milk. He then receives his ministers, and if a death-
warrant is brought to him to sign, he is intensely happy. It is imme-
diately torn up into a thousand pieces! he will listen to no more
business that day—but, without a hat, will rush into the garden and fly
kites, or play at coach and horses with his grandchildren. His heart
is so full that it must vent, itself in play—and he will jump over a
gardener's back as he is bending down—he will throw an officer's cap
up in a tree that he may have #. scampish delight of climbing up after
it—he will send the ball springing through a large window of beautiful
#. simply that he may enjoy the surprise of the servants and
ne ladies, who instantly rush out to inquire who is the author of the
guilty fracture. It is most charming to observe the EMPEROR on such
joyful occasions—you would imagine he was some simple country gen-
tleman, and not the Czar of all the Russias.
Then for three hours of uninterrupted application follow despatches,
and letters, proclamations, and ukases. The pay of some favoured regi-
ment is increased—some poor political prisoner, exiled to Siberia quite
unknown to the EMPEROR, is liberated—some young Russian nobleman
has his passport honoured with the signature of the EMPEROR, thus
receiving the Imperial permission to travel out of Russia. Nicholas
writes every one of his letters—and like a wise sovereign will insist upon
his signature always proceeding from his own pen.
These matters of state occupy his mind till dinner, which indeed is
very quickly discussed. As the EMPEROR is a vegetarian—(and a
vegetarian not so much from choice as from principle, as he objects to
taking the life of a single living being)—the table is not occupied by
large joints of meat, nor the time taken up in consuming them. A fried
potato, a stewed pea or two, a boiled cauliflower, a mouthful of roasted
onion, with perhaps a small plate of cherry pie, and a custard to follow,
complete his repast; which his Majesty will enjoy better than the
grandest dirner you could give him at the Astor Hotel. He will rise
joyfully from the Imperial mahogany, and, with the smack of an epicure,
exclaim, “I have dined to day—like a Prince!” -
His favourite beverage is orangeade; but with his cheese, he will
indulge occasionally by taking a glass of ginger-beer. -
In the evening he plays a round game, but never for money... Some-
times he will read out a fairy or nursery tale to the ladies, as they are
assembled round the table, busy with their needles. . His great enjoy-
ment is to make tea. Cribbage, too, is another of his amusements,
and, if he wins two or three games, his merriment knows no bounds.
One of his favourite pursuits is to stick pictures and engravings in an
album. At ten his gruel is brought in with lighted candles, and
many seconds do not elapse before he walks up to bed carrying one in
l
The acquirements of the EMPEROR are very considerable. . He can
build a house of cards at least six stories high before they begin to fall,
and he is very clever, also, in inventing riddles. When no one is nigh,
he has been known to try them on the servants, and has often
interrupted a Cabinet Council to ask.NESSELRope some, laughable
conundrum that has just struck him. His voice is beautifully clear and
soft, and he employs it to great advantage in singing hymns. He is,
however, not above singing a comic song, occasionally, and he does it
with such rare humour, that the chamberlains, always laugh; ...His
ability in cutting out likenesses in black paper is the marvel of all those
who have witnessed it. -
Such are the tastes and habits of the great man, who has been so dis-
gracefully vilified by all Europe, but by England especially!. It will be
America's proud glory (through me) to vindicate the character of this
ºted Hero ! All Honour to Nicholas !—The New York Hatchet-
trotter.

The Astronomical March of Intellect.
MR. PEPPER, the able and indefatigable Managing Director of the
Polytechnic, is giving a series of interesting lectures on the Precession
of the Equinoxes. We understand that the manager of a minor
theatre has written to know at what expense this procession might be
introduced into a Grand Eastern Spectacle. The Manager supposing
that the Great Bear and the Little Bear will be introduced in the pro-
cession, proposes that these interesting characters should be repre-
sented by living animals. He has also undertaken to get the composer
of the establishment to “arrange”, some entirely new music to the
procession, to be played by the Band of Orion—if the members of that
famous orchestra should be open to an engagement.

FoRGIVE AND FoRGET-This maxim is admirable when applied to
others, and to others alone should it be applied, for it will never do for
you (unless you’re an Officer) to Forgive and Forget yourself.

MR. BRIEFLESS AND THE COUNCIL ON LEGAL
EDUCATION.
WE, are authorised to, state that in consequence of the recom-
mendation of the Council of Legal Education respecting the public
examination of law, students, MR. BRIEFLEss is ready to take pupils
and give them his best consideration in return for the best hº
consideration they may be prepared to offer. His plan will be very
comprehensive,..,and embrace, all the subjects recommended by the
Council. He will commence with RAPIN, and will particularly elucidate
those chapters relating to the law of rapine and robbery. The law of
Real Property will be richly illustrated with specimens of the thing
itself, and a theatrical property man has been engaged to make all, the
properties as real as possible. The “liability of purchasers” will be
familiarly shown by MR. BRIEFLEss himself, who will give the student
the run of his papers, and allow him the perusal of the innumerable
dunning letters to which purchasers—who don't pay for what they
purchase—are incessantly liable. The theory of “verbal contracts”
will be exemplified in a pleasant way by ordering a dinner at the
Rainbow, where the contract, though verbally made,will hold good
and the student in return for this valuable illustration will be calle
upon to pay merely the cost of the dinner. The important science of
the “natural obligations,” arising from ownership, will be shown by
the aid of several pawn tickets, on which the owner is “naturally
obliged”, to pay the interest.—N.B. The pupil will be expected to
furnish the funds for this highly useful practical lesson. As a sequel
to the “liability of purchasers,” a few examples will be given of the
“liability of vendors,” who are very liable to lose their money if they
happen to give credit.
- common law the student will have an opportunity of watch-
ing, from experience, the effect of every step from the service
of the writ of summons, at MR. BRIEFLEss's own outer-door, by
pushing it through the letter-box, to the final adjudication. The
above sketch, though incomplete, will it is believed, enable those
young gentlemen who are entering on the study of the law, to
calculate on the advantages they will gain by being the pupils of
MR. BRIEFLEss.

Very Close Husbandry.
It was stated last week in the papers that many farmers
had given their labourers notice of a reduction of wages,
in consequence of the bountiful harvest. Is this the way
to show gratitude for such a blessing? Those grinding
agriculturists, who are capable of reducing the wages of
their labourers for such a reason, deserve to be reduced
themselves, so as ultimately to be set to work at macada-
|mizing the roads in the capacity of reduced farmers.

WHAT IS A TRAVELLER 2
We know a jovial old gentleman, who has
answered this question Nº. cleverly:-He
knocks at the door of an hotel, or public-
house, and demands admission on the plea of his
being a traveller. Upon his being questioned or
detained, he produces one of MuRRAY's Hand.
books. This is as good as an “Open Sesame” at
once, for how can agentleman's word be doubted
that he is a bond fide traveller, when he has a
crimson Guide to Switzerland, or Sweden, or
Turkey in his hand? The Gentleman we are
alluding to always makes a point of carrying
one of these useful “Handbooks” with him
when he travels on a Sunday-even if his travels
do not exceed a sixpenny cab-fare from his own
door. He says he does not know an instance
of its having failed to open the door once. In
fact, for ourselves, we have always heard that
a MURRAy’s Handbook was universally looked
upon as an undeniable pºor of an English
Traveller all over the world.

select than otherwise—with crowned heads, is, that kings and emperors do not speak in blank
verse, though they do not talk in the slang of excessive familiarity; there is, however, a
considerable margin in styles of address between the “old cock” of modern farce, and the
“sire” of ancient tragedy. We believe that the royal personages lately assembled at Boulogne
met and talked like gentlemen, without either the courtier-like fooleries of Noodle and
DooDLE on the one hand, or the utter unceremoniousness of Box and Cox on the other.

Can none of our
illustrated contemporaries give us an idea of the costume adopted
in America by the female medical profession?, That of the physician
of the old school, tastefully adapted, would be becoming...The hair
might be powdered, and gathered at the poll in a queue. Where the
dress sets off behind, the place of the little rapier might be supplied
by a Cupid's dart, in an elegant case or quiver, stuck diagonally
across the prominence. The gold-headed cane could be matched
by the gold handled parasol. It would be necessary that the costume
should be of the Bloomer species, in order that the idea of it might be
carried out by shorts (elongated to a suitable extent) of black velvet,
with their accompaniments and continuations of silk stockings of the
same colour, and gold or silver buckles. -
Perhaps, after all, there is no great absurdity in the notion of female
physicians. All physicians, except those who practise gratuitously, may
be designated by the word female spelt with another e, and there are
not a few of whom that is all that can be said. If the head of a woman
is not calculated for the formation of a diagnosis, she can at least shake
it, in a difficult case, as effectually as a man can; and, having a softer
and more musical voice than the masculine, she is bettºr. ualified than
most men are for that large part of medical practice which consists in
whispering comfort to invalids. -
The Ladies’ Collele in London does not, we believe, grant medical
degrees; but there appears to be no reason why it should mot, if it
chooses, confer on its students the distinctions of Spinster and Dcctress
of Medicine. Nor is there any law, that we know of, to prevent a lady
from serving an apprenticeship to a general practitioner, attending lec-
tures, walking the hospitals, drinking beer, and smoking cigars if she
likes, and passing an examination at Apothecaries' Hall or the College
of Surgeons. It is quite possible that in a short time Savile Row may
exhibit a succession of brass plates, engraven with the names of medigal
lades who have brass enough to place them on their doors.
GIVE US THE PAPER.—WHO’S DIWORCEDP
We have received a file of papers from California, and we learn that
the go-ahead population of that region have caused a new feature to be
introduced into their newspapers. In the announcements of Births,
Marriages, and Deaths, the §. ifornians imitate our own press, except
that they frequently give the weight of the new baby, that they eschew 'i
the humbug which supposes that one parson cannot unite a lady and
gentleman without “assistance,” and that they occasionally launch out
into franker and more specific laudations of a deceased party than is
usual here—indicating, if he were a tradesman, what article he was
celebrated for selling in perſection and cheap, and not hesitating to re-
cord that he was a “witty chap and a crack shot.” But they haye
added a fourth estate to the list, and between the Marriages and the
last announcements they insert Divorces. . And as divorce is cheap and
easy in America, the papers are seldom without some notification of the
kind, and of the reasons for the step which has been taken.
Shall we ever come to this in England? Will divorce ever cease to
be the exclusive right of the rich man? And shall we ever read any-
thing of this kind in the first column of the Times *-
DIVORCES.

Mr. Punch sincerely hopes never to read anything of the kind. But
who knows?
SPIRITUAL PERFORMANCES.
We are informed by the Spiritual Telegraph, a new American paper,
that acts as a kind of Telegraph between the Present and the Past,
delivering messages from the other world at so much a line, that—
“The latest reports speak of a new drama dictated by the Spirit of SHAREsprARE,
and superior to any of his former works. It has been read to the manager of the
Broadway. Theatre, and is now about to be brought out as one of the greatest
curiosities.”
. Here is Novelty, that promises to be an effectual cure for the Decline
in which our Drama is said to be in Could not our managers, our
BUCKSTONEs, our SMItas, our CHARLEs KEANs, and CoNQuests—
engage the same “Spirit” to write them a few dramas?–dramas that
should be superior to J/acbeth, or the Midsummer Night’s Dream, or any
of the same 5. is!'s former works; though by the hy, if they were
only as good, we should be perfectly content. We foresee but one
difficulty to this very original plan—and that is the scarcity of Shak-
spearean actors. If our managers engaged the Spirit of SHAKSPEARE
to write them a tragedy, they would also have to engage the Spirits of
other actors to act it, for we are sure we have but very few performers
of the present day who could do justice to it. However, this double
plan would only enhance the attraction, and we can imagine the
excitement produced by an announcement iike the following:—
On Monday next will Positively be Produced
A NEW FIVE-ACT PLAY,
CALLED
NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE ;
WRITTEN by the SPIRIT of the celebrated WILLIAM SHARSPEARE
And in which the Spirits of Messrs. Edmund Kean, John Kemble,
Charles Kemble, Bannister. Oxberry, Incledon, Abbott, Egerton,
Warde, Mrs. Siddons, Miss O'Neil, Mrs. Billington, &c. &c. will
perform.
Assisted by various other Spirits of Minor reputation.
The Scenery by the Spirits of Vandyke, Hogarth, and Sir Joshua
Reynolds; and the Dresses and Decora ions by the Spirits of Brnºn-
mel, David, Gros, and Stultz; all of whom have been engaged at an
enormous expense. The Incidental Dances will be presided over by
the Spirit of Westris (the acknowledged “Dieu de la Danse.")
tº” A subordinate part will be plaved by the Spirit of the
“IMMoRTAL BARd.” himself, who has kindly consented (through a
talented Spirit-Medium') to return to the Stage on this occasion only.
*...* N.B. No increase in the prices.
The above would be something like a Bill!—a Bill that would be
instantly honoured by thousands “at sight,” even if it were only
“second sight.” We have but one fear that there would not be a Spirit
Vault in the kingdom large enough to contain the thousands who would
rush to hear the Spirited performances. We have, also, another fear,
that this new scheme (which would not be in the least sacrilegious) of
calling “Spirits from the vasty deep,” and getting them to answer to
the “call” (by the way, who would be the Spiritual Call-boy to this
modern theatre des Bezua. Esprits?) is far too Spiritual ever to be
carried out.
BLAck-BALL PRACTICE.-A man was never black-balled at a Club
yet, but it turned out afterwards that somehow “his name had been
put up without his consent.”
DEFINITION, a la TALL&YRAND.—Ingratitude is only a painful feeling
of consciousness that there are no more favours to be received from
the same person.

THE CZAR’S TREMENDOUS SACRIFICE.
lN reference to the four conditions for the restoration of peace,
tendered by Austria to the Czar, we are informed by Submarine and
European Telegraph that—
“The EMPERoR Nicholas would rather sacrifice his last soldier than accept such
propositions."
As self-constituted Head of the Russo-Greek Church, Nicholas is
Pontiff as well as Czar. In the character of High Priest he offers
sacrifices, in that of Autocrat he provides victims. The Russian Gen-
tleman is quite a patriarchal sort of personage, combining, in himself,
the capacities of Priest, King, and Shepherd. The mutton, however,
which he devotes to his gods, is a two-legged species, and may perhaps
have some little voice in the question of its own immºlation. It is well
that he has published his intention of sacrificing his last soldier rather
than his pride. His slaves will now have some leisure to consider how
they like, and whether or not they can help, being sacrificed by their
master to MoLoch.
EXCUSE FOR HORSE GUARDS.
E must not be too hard upon
the gallant officers, of whom the
late Court - Martial on LIEU-
TENANT PERRY was constituted ;
we should not too severely con-
demn the GENERALCOMMANDING-
IN-ChIEF for recommending the
confirmation of the judgment of
that tribunal. Such a verdict,
such a sentence, on the part of
a civil judge and a common jury,
would certainly have been simply
airccious. But it is º:
to expect the judgment of Solo-
Mon from judges not endowed
with SQLOMON's advantages; and
when their learning and abilities
bear no proportion whatever to
those of Solomon, it is only reason-
able to be satisfied with a corres-
* ponding amount of justice and
wisdom in their decision. The
“Memorandum,” entitled “In-
structions for Officers on first
| - joining a Regiment or Depot,”
contains much—very much—in addition to the spirit of pure morality
which it breathes, that will palliate the iniquity of the award in question.
For instance, take the very first paragraph; in which it is stated that
the GengRAL CoMMANDING-IN-Chief had apprehended that certain
“inconsiderate officers”
"Might bring their regiments into disrepute unless, in their social conduct towards
each other at their mess-table and in their barrack-rooms, their behaviour should be
regulated by a higher standard of what is due to the honourable position in which they
stand as holders of commissions in HER MAJEsty s Army.”
...Regulated, that means, by a higher standard of moral and gentleman-
like feeling. If the author of the above-quoted clumsy piece of circum-
locution hesitated to express his meaning in plain terms, he should of
course have said “estimate,” not “standard.” “Standard of what is
due !” What corporal's grammar you would call this, if you did not

Here is a similar specimen of composition:—
“The case originated in a disgraceful scene of deep gambling in a barrack room
at Windsor, between Lieutenant GR-ER and Lieutenant Priºry, terminating in a
violent assault, in the course of which the most disgusting language was applied by
LIEUTENANT GREER to LIEUTENANT PERRY.” |
In the course of the assault, or in the course of the “scene of deep
gambling?”. Why “scene,” when there were no spectators? “Affair”
is the word that would have been used by any decent clerk.
One more example will perhaps be just tolerable:—

There were England's beacons blazing, like red eyes, throug the night.
And he knew those ships were waiting, if his dared put to sea;
And he knew those fires were lighted by men who still were free.
And though his soldiers, ships, and guns were as twenty unto one,
He knew what Englishmen could do—what Englishmen had done.
Like an unquiet tiger, that chafes, and champs, and cries
Before a couchant lion, that stirs not where he lies,
So chaſed fierce France upon the cliff which looks on Boulogne town-
So still-so stern—lay England, upon the Kentish down.
1840.
I wonder what his thoughts were—that shabby, silent man-
As thirty-six years later to shore a pinnace ran
Bearing a homeless penniless adventurer, with his train,
A draggled pinioned Eagle, and some cases of champagne.
Was it trusting to the magic of his great uncle's name,
That on a desperate yenture thus recklessly he came *
Or deemed he, like that uncle, he was following a star,
That beckoned him still forwards, on a road no force could bar 2
Had he well read the people, when thus he came unto
Their sympathy with hardihood, their love of l'imprévu ;
Deem'd he the attendant eagle would guarantee the Jove?
Or was 't trust in five-franc pieces—like to his with whom he strove
Did he foresee the downfall of that throne that seemed so sure?
Deem'd he that desperate evils would hail a desperate cure?
Was it Debt, or was it Destiny that drove him on his way
To the maddest act that madman did ever yet essay?
How lured he on the scanty band that made his cause their own?
Saw he or they the shadow of Revolution thrown
From the dim Future forwards?—saw he the prison-cell
Opening upon the palace f His thoughts—what man can tell?
Enough that to this shore he came—landed and fought and failed:
Nor in that madman's enterprise—nor ever after-quailed;

A pleaderſor his forfeit life—a prisoner—but still
iſent and stern and saturnine, and of an iron will.
We cite the first NAPOLEoN, when a banned and banished man,
With his handful of old grenadiers he sprang to shore at Cannes,
As one who threw a desperate throw, and thereby won a throne—
What was he unto his nephew-in that landing at Boulogne?
1854.
I wonder what his thoughts were—that sad-eyed, silent man,
As alongside Boulogne's jetty England's royal steamer ran;
While with a King beside him, that adventurer was seen
Greeting, as Emperor of France, the Consort of our Queen?
The people press about him, with cheers and prayers and vows;
The court, the camp, the church, its best, its bravest, holiest brings;
There stands the madman of Boulogne–a Kaiser among kings!
What memories are sweeping through that impassive brain?
Thinks he of that first landing—of his out-at-elbows train?
Of the oath—or of the ballot—or of June's red barricades?
Or thinks he of December's yet bloodier fusillades?
Or turns he from the past—with its bead-roll of dark deeds,-
Its desperate encounters with yet more desperate needs,
To the present with its trials, its triumphs, and its tasks,
Oris’t of the veiled future, her secret that he asks?
Is he thinking how what shall be may wipe out what has been?
How the blood stains may be hid from sight under the laurels green?
How long Prestige of Power may into silence awe
The still small voice of NEMEsis, the claims of Right and Law?
Why question thus? Heavensends the scourge; but in that guidinghand,
What chastens still to blessing turns. So doth this man's command.
Own we in him an instrument, through sin, and pain, and blood,
That worketh still, as all things work together, unto good.
*Tis due to him that France's flag floats side by side with ours,
*Tis due to him that France's hosts are leagued with England's powers;
Thankful tor this, 'twere out of place too curiously to scan,
Through the good deeds of the monarch, the ill deeds of the man.
“YOU JUST LET THAT TUB ALONE.”
THE Witlers must not blame us. We always told them that their
Organ played flat-flat as yesterday-drawn beer—and now they are
#. it out for themselves. They have held a large meeting to
proclaim their discovery that the Morning Advertiser is unworthy of
them. Cremorne, and Hampton Court, and the Coalhole all open fire
upon the unlucky Tub, which rolls helplessly about like a buoysmitten
by cannon-balls.
“The victuallers must in justice to themselves encourage other
papers,” says one victualler. “It rested with the trade, if not to give up
the organ, to get rid of the present organ-blowers,” says another.
A third speaker announces that “the Morning Advertiser is barely
tolerated in many houses. As a literary production it is far behind
the age; in point of intellect, it is a disgrace to the trade, and far in-
ſerior to the articles in the Family Herald and other penny publi-
cations.” A fourth complains that PRINCE ALBERT is abused by the
poor Tub, and that “SIR WILLIAM MoLEsworth had been held up to
the public as a demon of darkness in its pages.” A fifth is “cbliged
by rules to take in the paper, but hopes to get rid of it; ” while a sixth
goes savagely at our unlucky friend JENKINs On The Beer Barrel:—“It
was the management that was reducing the Morning Advertiser to its
present wretched, canting, drivelling condition. Why, they actually
offered a genºleman five shillings per week for undertaking to supply
the fashionable news of the paper, but afterwards consented to make it
three half-crowns!”
We deeply sympathise with our contemporary, who is thus assaulted
on all points, and who is declared to understand neither the interests
of his clients the witlers, nor the politics and fashion for which he
sacrifices them. We hardly know what advice to give him. He has
abused the Roman Catholics with every injurious epithet in the language,
thundering at them in a way to turn sour all the beer of all his patrons,
and yet he cannot give satisfaction. He has even published Random
Records of the most wonderful and adventurous tour that perhaps was
ever accomplished since Hogarth and his friends went to Gravesend,
but the startling narrative, brilliant sketching, and deep philosophy of
the work failed to tell. He has printed and praised the jerks and
spasms of that convulsive vituperator the “Englishman Out of Bedlam,”
t people, touching their foreheads, said with Miss Flite, “A little
M. you know.” He has lauded MR. Urquhart, and even proclaimed
The ships around are gay with flags, the streets are green with boughs;|Z.
LoRD DUDLEY STUART's fitness for office. He has committed ludicrous
typographical errors, and, that everybody might notice them, has
apologised for them next day. What more, we ask in all earnestness
of pleading for an oppressed contemporary, can a poor party do who
wishes to make a journal famous? %. will not see the Tub ill-
treated; we fought for PERRy, and certainly shall not “forget the
humbler creature, Small Beer.” We will trouble the witlers to let
that Tub alone. .
SLEEWES AND SAUCE.
THE most stupid and ugly
fashions always last the
longest. How many years
the long dresses have swept
the streets! For the last
twelve months bonnets have
been flying off the head
and so, probably, they will
continue for twelve more.
º; However, the bonnets are
% º ridiculous. As to
long dresses, there is some-
thing to be said for them.
They are convenient to aged
ladies. They enable them
ſ/ to enjoy, without attracting
remark, the comfort of list
slippers and laced stockings
4 and rollers for their poor
3 old ankles. They render it
* possible for young ladies to
wear bluchers high-
lows, thereby avoiding
% damp feet, and to save
* washing, by making one
pair of stockings last a
week. So they will doubt-
less continue to be worn whilst the laws of Fashion are dictated by
a splayfooted beauty, or a lady troubled with bunions.
But this kind of apology cannot be made for hanging sleeves. They
are not only absurd but inconvenient. They are always getting in the
way, and the sauce, and the butter-boat. Your wife cannot help you
to a potato across the table but she upsets her glass, and breaks it with
her gling sleeve. It may be said that your wife has no business to
help potatoes—that there ought to be footmen in attendance for that
purpose. Certainly : or else, she should not wear the sleeves. ...But
ladies must, of course, follow the height of fashion, whether suitable to
their circumstances or not. Could not the leaders of fashion, then, in
pity to the less opulent classes, devise and sanction a kind of sleeves
adapted to life in a cottage—whether near a wood or elsewhere—to be
called cottage sleeves, and to he worn by the genteel cottager-classes
without prejudice to their gentility?
Putting too fine a Point upon it.
AMong the improvements to be adopted in the costume of the British
soldier, we hear that those who wear helmets are to have a spike on
the top of them. This spike, which has often been a subject of amusing
contemplation to us on the head of the Prussian sentinel, has often
perplexed us as to the use to which it could be put, and we think the
ritish soldier will be puzzled what to do with it; for he cannot make
it an instrument of attack unless he does what he is not at all in the
habit of doing, and hows his head to the enemy. Perhaps indeed he
may sometimes, go full butt at a foe; but really we can ascertain no
|value in the spike, unless it be—as some fiend of mischief whispers in
our ear—to make the British soldiers con-spike-uous!
A British Flora for Russia.
THE paperstellus that the Victoria Regia has commenced flowering
in a hot-house at St. Petersburg. The fact is rather curious under
present circumstances, for we should scarcely have expected to find our
|Royal Victoria in St. Petersburg, where every house, and a fºrtiori a
hot-house, would probably be too hot to hold her. We hope, however,
to see Victoria, or at least the flower of her army, in full blow at
Sebastopol before the season is over.
Is It So?—The greatest rake, it is said, makes the best husband-on
the principle, we suppose, that the greatest drunkard makes the best
temperance-lecturer.

GOOD NEWS FOR COCKNEY TRAVELLERS.
We are happy to learn that the repeated complaints of the Cockney
tourists, who so feelingly depict, in letters to the Times, the dangers
and hardships, of travelling, are likely, to receive attention. , The
suggestion of the gentleman who desired that iron railings might be
carried up Helvellyn and placed along the side of the precipices, in order
are already in course of construction. The caves of Elephanta will be
ventilated, and commodious seats fixed reund them in the course of the
season. In the present ticklish state of transatlantic politics, we are
rejoiced to add that PRESIDENT PIERCE has signified to our representa-
tive, that he means,to have gauze screens placed all along the American
side of Niagara, to keep the spray of the cataract from splashing. On
the whole, therefore, we hope speedily to be able to assure the coward-
liest and feeblest Cockney, that he may see the world intolerable safety
and comfort.
to save him the expense of a conductor, and the requirement of the
other old woman who demanded a Bath chair in which she might be
wheeled up the mountain, have attracted the notice of the authorities,
and arrangements are being made, both at home and abroad, in the
spirit of those requisitions. The ascent of Snowdon will now be
easy, the road having been paved with flagstones, and comfortable
benches having been placed at every twenty-fifth yard. In the more
steep parts, cranes, have been fixed, by which, for a trifling fee, in pro-
portion to his weight, the traveller can be lifted from height to height
without trouble. Similar precautions have been taken with Ben Nevis,
and a capital restaurant, with all the English, French, and Scotch papers,
has been erected on its summit, and an electric telegraph from thence
to the nearest hotel will insure a traveller any luxury beyond what is
mentioned in the carte. The whole of the water in the Cumberland
lakes has been warmed, in order to º them to the wants of the class
who chiefly complain, and who naturally miss, in travelling, the tepid
baths in which they disport when their employers have allowed them to
shut up shop. Arthur's Seat has had cushions fitted to it, and Mac-
gillicuddy's Reeks have been expressly interdicted from smoking.
A similar system has been pursued on the continent. Mont Blanc
has been carpeted as high, as the Grands Mulets, MR. ALBERT SMITH
having been requested to bring out with him, to Chamouni, carpets of
the same pattern as those of the tapis in the Council-Room at Osborne,
where he recently gave his entertainment, and he is also to make
another ascent, for the purpose of indicating the best place for lamp-
posts, the government having determined to light Mont_Blanc with
gas, to the very top. We are glad to hear that the new Vice Roy, of
Gypt is equally alive to the advantages of making travellers comfortable,
and that he has caused an awning to be erected from SHEPHERD's
Hotel, at Cairo, across the desert, to the base of the Great Pyramid
at Gizeh, and all the sand is to be wetted with otto of roses, by the
Arabs, three times a day. The Governor-General of India, #.
DALHousIE, has sanctioned a plan for a railway from Calcutta to the
summits of the Himalayas, and the Dhawalaghiri and Jewahir stations

It is an honour and pleasure
to possess amongst us a
Prince so illustrious—to
find him busy for our wel-
fare, and devising kind
schemes for our good.
h Knowing how excellent
many of the customs are of
the foreign cities in which
it has been your good for-
tune to be bred, you na-
turally wish to benefit your
province of England and
your archdiocess of West-
minster, with importations
from abroad; and as my
wife comes home with a

son with a pair of mous-
– taches from Germany,
== }. Eminence, brings an

- º of an Inquisition from Spain. Often as I pass that modest
house in that modest Golden Square I think, with a respectful wonder, that the greatest man
of all the Empire lives within. Principibus praestat et regibus, &c. I will not continue the
§. But so the fact is. You are the equal of the QUEEN herself, what my friend
ULLIGAN calls, the “Shuparior” of Princes. Poor DR. SUMNER, is not fit to kiss your
honour's shoestrings, or DR. WHATELY to hold your red hat. Say that the Lord CHANCEL-
Lor, His Roy AL Highness Filip Mansix. Prince ALBERT, and your Eminent Lordship
were to visit my humble abode, I should be obliged to give you the pas before H. R. H. the
FIELD MARSHAL–upon my word I should—you would have to lead Mrs. Punch into dinner:
the other illustrious guest, of course, would be appropriated by my mother-in-law; and as for
the Chancellor, his Lordship and I would be obliged to walk in the dining-room arm-in-arm.
We should not be expected to kneel I suppose? I could hardly get my old knee-bones

the Watican and a little
down so low; not but that this very winter at
Rome I saw scores of folks doing so, and kissing
your Eminent Lordship's hand as if it were a
young beauty's.
What a fine thing it is to think that a man of
this Prodigious Rank (for such yours is) should
be an Englishman after all, and care for us, our
laws and our people ! In the late little affair of
BoyLE v. WISEMAN you came into Court like
any other. Briton; and after writing a libel
against this poor Boyle who vexed you (holy
Job was vexed with 'em too) how affably you
took advantage of the law which nonsuited him.
It is the greatest compliment which has been
| to our Courts, since PRINCE HENRY's be--
haviour in that notorious affair with Chief
Justice GAscoyne. A Cardinal by the Divine
pity, a Prince of Rome, you came into an
English Court to take your chance there: you
stood by the laws of your country: that is to
say, you did not exactly stand–you bolted as the
law gave you full permission to do—I can fancy
the confusion of poor BoyLE losing you when he
thought he had got you; and the calm good-
humour of your Eminence's face, seeming to say,
“Don’t you wish you may ?”
. The law business, although noble and edifying,
is not however that which occasions these brief
and respectful remarks. It is on your Eminent
§ appearance as an educator of all
England that the Nation ought to be congratu-
lated. It’s kind of you. %. very thing we
like is the Roman system. What we want is a
good Index Expurgatorius; a parental board of
Inquisition to look over the books for our people :
and prevent, them from being poisoned by bad
literature. Most pestilent lies are told by fellows
who write books: most wicked doctrines pro-
mulgated: and it is uncommonly good-natured
in a man occupied as your Eminence is, in the
affairs of your own church: rows and squabbles

with refractory priests; affairs of your newly-created province: regu-
lations of suffragans and minor clergy; writing articles for the Dublin
Review; and reports to that august foreign Court and Sovereign, greatest
of all Courts, Sovereign of all Sovereigns, of which, and under whom you
are yourself a most distinguished and ornamental Prince and Dignitary-
I say it is exceedingly kind of one so illustrious and so busy to think
about us outside Britons at all, and offer to ...} us in our emergency.
I had readin my favourite Journal, The Record, a brief report of “CAR-
DINAL WISEMAN's Lecture on the Home Education of the Poor,” but
waited until, Sunday and my still greater favourite, the Tablet, arrived,
with the authentic report of the Lecture. Here is, the journal before
me which speaks out like a man for its own part, and saying, “We have
often thought that even to a limited º point of view the
Index of Prohibited Books, of all other Catholic Institutions the one
scorned and hated by Protestants, is one that commends itself most highly
tº the calm piew of Reason.” Here is the Tablet and the report of the
Cardinal's Lectures. May I venture to make a respectful tonsure in
the columns — -
“His Eminence confined himself chiefly to the general topic of the want of a suitable
popular literature, reserving for his next lecture the consideration of the mºdes by
which it might be supplied. It seems most important, said His Eminence, that the
public, especially those interested in the education of the people, should know what is
at present the literature which awaits the rural population on leaving school. In
France this has been done, and it may be useful to know the results of the inquiry.
For several hundred years the population of France was supplied with a cheap lite-
rature by the well-known system of Colportage, by means of which some eight or nine
millions of small volumes and pamphlets were circulated amongst the people. But in
1852 a decree was issued by the Minister of the Police appointing a commission to ex-
amine all books sold by licensed hawkers, who were in future not to be allowed to
circulate any without the Government Stamp of approbation. This very interesting
report of the Commission has this year been published, from which it appears that of
the books that had been examined three-fourths had been condemned. . . . . if I
were in a position of political influence (said His Eminence) I should most strongly urge
upon the legislature the importance of appointing a Committee of Inquiry into this matter."
Of course you would. You would do as they do at Rome. We have
read about expugnandos, comburendos, expurgandos, and the old pro-
cesses; which commend themselves, as our friend the Table: says,
“most highly to the calm view of reason.” And if you were in a
position of political influence, we know, dear Eminence, that you would
keep your promise. -
But you see you are not in a position of political influence. We don't
want to go down on our knees, as they do at Rome. To kiss your
hand is not to us the source of the slightest comfort. Gentlemen who
choose to do so are welcome; but it appears from the Census church
returns that you and your followers are but as two hundred thousand,
to the ten millions of the unroman English. CHADBAND has as large
a flock as you have; who, had he his will, would no doubt smash
the windows of your mass-houses, break your images, and bonnet your
Eminence onW. big hat. We give hospitality to CHADBAND and
Wise MAN. hy not to other religionists?” Our exemplary ally, who
has stopped the Colporteurs, has stopped Punch too in his dominions.
Can it §: that if your Eminence were in a position of political influence
you would go so far? Heaven help us!, I fear yes. e should have
a certain shop in St. Bride's shut up if that “political influence” could
but be managed; and “calm reason” could but get its own way. You
would no more let us in than in Rome, where you have political influence,
| you let the Thirty-nine Articles pass the Porta del Popolo! Fancy
your Eminence's faith and practice restored among us, and we should
see, not only FRANcis Moore, Physician, against whose poor old alma-
macs you are wrath, but Charles JAMEs (now JAMEs of London), and
| Mr. Punch walking out of the city, and across the fines patriae, like

Considering that your religion is not ours, but exists here on, tole;
ration; that your journals take their fill, in abusing our Church and
political establishments (I have heard of DR. New MAN in the pulpit
making admirable fun of the former); that you are free to publish your
tracts, apologues, homilies, and sell them where and at what price you
please, is it not a little premature in your eminent Lordship to
quarrel with other folks for doing exactly what you do? Were you in
a station of “political influence” I do not say, of course you would
gag every man of us according to the Roman mode; but meanwhile,
why should we have a censorship for our press? on account of the
hostility to our received institutions of any writer or Fº of writers
living among us? Upon my honour and conscience I do not believe
there is any party in England so opposed to our views of right, morals,
politics, as the party of which you are the head. And you are let to
speak, to sneer, insinuate, deny, assert exactly what you please. Say a
Iormonite Gospel is an absurd and monstrous dupery in my eyes: so
I believe is a winking statue. But the man who advocates either is
welcome to publish his belief in this country, where the mischief is met
not by persecution, but by, free discussion, and where Joe SMITH's
jº. (decently attired) have as good a right to a sea-baptism as
DR. NEwMAN to wear a hair-shirt or FATHER IGNATIUs to shave his
head. How did you win those two gentlemen over to your side f By
free discussion. How is the conversion of all England to come about,
and the day when we shall all be down on our marrowbones in the
street when your Eminence walks it? By more free discussion, more
books, more preaching, more pamphlets, more cuts at the Established
Church, and what not. We can't have that commission of inquiry as
yet in F. own particular interest; otherwise your shop would be shut
as well as other peoples', and your preachers would be as mum as the
MADIAI. In our field the wholesome literature and the bad, the tares
and the wheat, must grow up together, and, saving your Eminent
presence, that is very likely the reason why some of the rubbish,
stamped with the tiara and cross keys, and guaranteed with a “permissu
Superiorum,”, is allowed to pass current in the country....Mischievous
works forsooth pernicious literature! degraded superstitious!, absurd

PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE UNDER DIFFICULTIES.
THE Morning Post, describing a recent fire, in Sackville Street, says
“The conflagration was caused by a candlestick setting fire to the fur-
niture while reading in bed.” }: cannot quite, make out, from this
statement, whether it was the candlestick or the furniture that was
reading in bed, but in either case great imprudence was manifested.
If the candlestick was the offender, it ought to have known better,
having had so much experience of fire, but for the furniture to be
reading in bed was most unpardonable. , What was the particular
article of furniture that was thus unseasonably devoting itself to litera-
ture we are not told. Perhaps it was the Sofa, studying its own history
in Cowper's Task; or the ği Arm-chair, reading its praises by Miss
Cook; or it might have been an earnest-minded dining table desirous
to turn over other leaves than its own. But be the culprit what it may
we hope the example will not be followed, as we are sure it is as ainful
to the Morning Post to describe such things as to us to read of them.
THE TYRANNY OF FURNITURE.
It is a folly to suppose, when a man amasses a quantity of furniture,
that it belongs to him. On the contrary, it is he who belongs to his fur-
niture /. He is bound hand and foot by it—he is tied by the leg to his
own mahogany' He cannot move anywhere without dragging his fur-
niture alter him—he cannot go abroad without pleviously finding a
home for his furniture; he cannot be absent,for any time without first
taking every precaution that his furniture will be properly-provided for
in his absence. If he prºjects any little trip, the thought that always
stops him at the door, is, “Whatever shall I do with my furniture?”.
Many aman who boasts of his freedom is the secret slave of his furni-
ture. No man can call himself perfectly free who, whatever he does,
or wherever he goes, has always to carry in his mind so many chairs
and tables |
Conscience Money for Intenperance.
THE CHANCELLOR of the ExchequER has to acknowledge the
receipt of 5s. from “D.D., for amount of penalty due by reason of
excess in port”. Also of £91, 5s, from “BIBo, money owing to
Government for the state in which he has gºne to bed every night for
the last year.” Likewise of 15s. from “THREE Jolly Postpoys
Drinking at THE CARLTON, for fine incurred after dinner at their
Club on Sunday.”

THE LIFE-GUARDS AT BOULOGNE.
- -
AFTER THE FATIGUES OF THE REVIEW, A GALLANT FELLOW. Is SHOWN HIS BED.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PRINCE ALBERT AND THE BRITISH
CONSULATE AT BOULOGNE.
WE are authorised to state—or in other
words we are , justified in stating — that
PRINCE ALBERT, as he passed from the Port
of Boulogne along the Rue de Boston, must
have felt extreme mortification at the sight
of the old tin pot .."; over which the British
Consulate hangs out for the purpose of selling
passports. The whole concern is derogato
to the dignity of the British throne, of whic
the crazy old chair in the one pair back is the
temporary representative. The rather, irri-
table individual who rushes out from an inner
room when the bell rings, to confer aid and
protection on the part of Sa Majesté Britan-
nique, was of course not presentable as the
representative of the English Government in
Boulogne, on the arrival of PRINCE ALBERT.
Had. His Royal Highness, been desirous
of visiting the consular establishment on the
Port, he might have hauled himself up the
dark and narrow stairs by a rope which
loosely does the duty of banisters. By
pushing º a door, he would have rung a
bell, which might probably have brought an
old woman or a young child into his illustrious.
presence.
It may perhaps be convenient; that the
Consulate should have a passport shop in the
lower town, and that the public should be
spared the trouble of going to the distance at
which the Consul resides, but surely, con-
sidering the profit on the passports, a more
decent boutique might be engaged than a
lodging over the tin pot establishment.
How the World is Ruled !
(By an old Schoolmaster.)
THE World, to my eyes, is divided into two
classes—those whose province it is to dictate
to others, and those (the more numerous class)
who are bound to receive their dictation. . It
would do a great deal of good, if the two
classes could occasionally c º places, so
that those who dictate, might know that it
is not always so agreeable to be dictated to.
UPON THEM-cHARGE |
THE Forty-Sixth will, it is said, immediately
leave for the East. We are rather surprised
to hear that the Commander-in-Chief has
altered the proper destination of this regi-
ment, which it was supposed would be im-
mediately sent to Coventry.
A VILLAGE HAMPDEN IN THE CHURCH.
A WILLAGE, or at least a º HAMPDEN is not always doomed to
neglect, and it is probable that he will be more than appreciated if he
happens to be the son of a Bishop. The following paragraph, extracted
from the Times of one day last week, will quite justify our statement:—
“RApid Ecclesiastical ProMotion.—The Rev. Edward'RRNN HAMPDEN, a son of
the Bishop of HERRFoad, has made rapid progress in Church preferment in the course
of the present year. Early in the year the incumbency of Breinton, in the diocess of
Hereford, became vacant, and the Bishop conferred it upon his son. He had held this
living but a few weeks, when Canon Musgrave, Rectºr of Eaton Bishops, was preferred
to a living in Yorkshire. The rectory of Eaton Bishops, being worth about £500
a year, and in the gift of the Bishop of HEREFord, was conferred upon MR. HAMPDEN.
He had not long been installed into the rectory of Eaton Bishops, when the death of
the DEAN of St. As ApH rendered vacant, among many other benefices, the rectory of
Cradley, worth £1,000 a year. This, being one of the Bishop's livings, was conferred
upon MR. Hampden, and he has been duly collated to it by his father. The Reverend
gentleman has thus been preferred to three benefices in the course of a few months.”
The “fortunate youth” mentioned in the above extract seems to
have risen with a celerity and success that entitle him to be considered
as a sort of ecclesiastical aeronaut, and his ascent may be regarded as a
piece of church ballooning that throws into the shade by its excessive
boldness, the comparatively commonplace exhibitions of aerostation at
Cremorne and Vauxhall Gardens. The Reverend gentleman, starting
from rather low ground, suddenly shoots up to the parsonage of Brein- |
ton, and ascending rapidly, he reaches the adjacent heights of the
rectory of Eaton Bishops. Here he scarcely pauses, but continuing
his upward career, he touches the rectory of Cradley (worth £1,000 |
per annum), having thus reached within a very brief space of time !
three different º: of elevation, all within the diocese of his excellent
father, the good Bishop of HEREFORD, . . - -
It will be admitted that there is nothing in the annals of ordinary
ballooning that beats this achievement in audacity, and we think the
lessee of Vauxhall may now complain with reason, that while, he was
not permitted to º money by sending up the Italian Brothers
hanging by their heels, and risking two lives, the ecclesiastical aeronauts
have been suffered to experimentalise on three livings... We presume
the reverend gentleman has not been overloaded with ballast, nor could
he have much occasion for grapnels—as there has been really nothing
for him to grapple with. The name of HAMPDKN is illustrious, and
“the cause for which HAMPDEN fell in the field” is never spoken of
without respect by Englishmen, but “the cause for which HAMPDEN
rose in the Church” will, we fear, give rise to a feeling of a very
different character. -

perusing my letter to
our Eminence in the

good Mr. Punch, what
expressions are these to

body of Christians, and
to their chief in this
country ! What is - the
use of hard words? What
call have you to be put-

quarrel I mean) not much
better carried on without
your interference?”

common occasions, can there be any earthly use in using such naughty words as
superstition, absurdity, folly, &c. to any body of brother Englishmen.
. Your Eminence does not use a hard word–you are, as mild as milk—you would
just like to have a little censorship over us, for the sake of the poor benighted
peasantry and mechanics in these islands—just to see that lies are not told to them,
and they are kept out of harm's way. Were you in a situation of political influence
you would strongly urge the importance of an inquiry—that’s all. What on earth

also got a grimoire, and a wonder-book, that seems to us unbelievers no better than

would have of us is a trifle compared to that demanded by your Doctors. Read

Master Punch reads—
“Mythical representations, at least in their better form, may be considered facts, or narratives
untrue, but like the truth . . . The same remark may be made upon certain narratives of martyrdom
or of the details of such narratives, or of certain alleged miracles, or heroic acts or speeches, all of

Now is a doctrine like that absurd or not mischievous or not? Would you
have country village-folks instructed in history after this fashion, your reverences
CARDINAL WISEMAN and
9d Sir, I “
|
King. Arthur and Jack, the Giant Killer in their place in
English history. Read me my favourite little bit about
SAINT GERMANUs, my dear, from the Lives of the English
Saints. Master Punch reads—
“While SAINT GERMANUs was in this country (449), the Saxons made
one of their annual inroads into Britain. SAINT GERMANus (an old
soldier), upon information that the combined armies of the Saxons and
Picts were approaching, at once resolved on putting himself at the head
of the British forces. Having led the troops into a narrow defile he gave
orders to them what to do. When the Saxons drew near with all the
confidence of men secure of victory, the holy Bishop pronounced, three
successive times, the word ALLELUIA, which was immediately taken
up by the whole British army and chaunted in chorus. The sound was
repeated and reverberated by the echo from the mountains, and with
such violence that the rocks and even the very heavens themselves
seemed to tremble. The barbarians supposing so loud a shout must
issue from an immense body of men, threw down their arms, and ran
away in all directions.”
Now, I can beat this with a hundred extracts out of the
Golden ſº. (which is in the book-case yonder), but I
will trouble your Eminence to match it out of FRANCIs
Moore. Suppose the country restored to the faith of our
Fathers, suppose an army under Nicholas of Westminster
advantageously posted º Oxford Street; Holborn in
possession of the enemy; and an army of Greek schismatics
under NICHOLAs of Petersburg, and his son, with a bat-
tery of guns before the marble arch. NICHOLAs (the Czar)
is about to open his fire. Nicholas the Cardinal orders
three yolleys of Alleluia along his whole line, and away
goes, the Calmuck horse, foot, and dragoons, leaving
standards, muskets, lances, knouts, &c., behind iſ.”
Would you, on your conscience as an Englishman, and
supposing you were in an influential military position,”
handle the British army in that way? Is that story not in
your books? Do you believe in it or any part of it. Ought
it to have occurred—Did SAINT GERMANUs so defeat the
Picts and Danes potentially? Pooh!
Now, my dear child, read me that bit about my darling
Saint, ŠAINT Gunpig.
“SAINT GUNDLE was a king in Glamorganshire about 500; his wife
was GLAdusA, one of the ten daughters of KING BRAchan. One night a
supernatural voice broke in on the slumbers of GUNDLE and GLADUSA,
and said, “The King of Heaven hath called me hither. . . . . . I will
show you the straight path which you must keep, unto the inheritance
of God–Lift up your minds, and for what is perishable, slight not your
souls. On the river's bank is a rising ground; and where a white
steed is grazing there is thy habitation.'
“The king arose in the morning: he gave up his sovereignty to his
son CADoc; he left his house, he proceeded to the hill, and found the
animal described. There he built a church, and there he began an
abstinent and saintly life; his dress a hair cloth, his drink water, his
bread of barley mixed with wood-ashes. He rose at miduight and
plunged into cold water, and by day he laboured for his livelihood."—St.
Gundleus, 7.
There’s a king in Glamorganshire for you! “The King of
Hearen”, sent a messenger to him to leave his wife, live on
a rising hill, dress in hair-cloth, mix wood ashes with his
barley-bread, and jump into cold water at midnight! In
another charming passage, in the life of sweet SAINT EBBA,
we are told regarding SAINT CUTHBERT that-
“It is well known that SAINT CUThbear carried the jealousy of inter-
course with women, characteristic of all Saints, to a very extraordinary
pitch . . . . Yet such was the reputation of EBBA's sanctity and
the spiritual wisdom of her discourse, that SAINT Bede informs us that
when she, sent messengers to the man of God, he went and stopped
several days in conversation with her, going out of the gates at night-
fall, and spending the hours of darkness in prayer, either up to his neck
in the water, or in the chilly air."—St. Ebba, 114.
And we may be sure the Chronicler, speaks, in terms,
poetic and respectful, of “the hair shirts and the iron
; : and the secret spikes, corroding the flesh, and the
ong weals of the heavy discipline, and the craving thirst
and the stone pillow and the cold vigil,” which these goo
souls applied to one another, and would recommend to
2nt, the proper way in which the faithful should posterit

words, as hard I own they are, are they too hard?, But I
think with all this in your calendar, your Eminence is harder

WHAT IS THE • NEXT ARTICLE p
OR, THE PLAGUE OF THE SHOP.
IN some remarks which we lately had occasion to make on the
subject of Early Closing, we º a habit, common among shop-
men, particularly those of linendrapers, of attacking the purchaser of
any commodity with the question—“Any other article to-day, Sir?”
If a mild answer is returned in the negative, the query is followed up
with suggestions of “other articles;” so that a man cannot enter a
shop to get a pair of gloves without the fear of being bored by a series
of importunities. In case the customer is a lady, the annoyance thus
given has generally the effect of driving her to purchase a quantity of
goods that she has no occasion for—and the trick succeeds.
But the consequence of this practice is, that nomam will go into a
linendraper's shop if he can help it, or trust his wife or daughter shop-
|ping, except in case of absolute necessity. It is therefore for the trade
to consider whether they do not lose more than they in the lon f
haberdashers wish to be truly polite, they will relinquish their system
of forcing sales by practising on the delicate feelings of ladies. A lady
cannot utter those brief exclamations by which an individual of the
sterner sex is permitted to stop the mouths of the troublesome.
Over-eagerness to sell frequently defeats its own end. We have often
bolted from a book-stallin disgust because we were disturbed in turn-
ing over the volumes by the proprietor darting out uponus and pestering
us with the enumeration of works which he seemed to think we were
locking for; instead of quietly placing his catalogue within our reach.
|Only the other day, a boot salesman prevented us from further con-
sidering a contemplated investment of capitalina pair of “men’s strong
walking,” by making a dead set of this kind at us with, “Now then,
team we serve you with, Sir?—prime Oxonians—best Bluchers
-superior Alberts,” &c. Of course any man of refined feelings who is
thus, interrupted in reconnoitring the assortment of a stall or a shop
window, instantly vanishes. He has not made up his mind to buy; it
is possible that he may not buy, and he feels that in entering into a
negotiation which will perhaps turn out abortive, he may excite hopes
destined never to be realized, and trifle with the feelings of his fellow.

Should the foregoing remarks not occasion the instantiabatement of
the plague and nuisance against which they are directed, its victims

vacate the chair with a precipitancy which
led the assembly to believe that the attack
on Bºulogne had already commenced.
== A deputation of Bri nursemaids had
been appointed to wait on the Emperor to
ask him to spare the children, and in several
- places *Hºº were suspended from
the windows as flags of truce. The English, coal-merchant threw
himself at the feet of the Emperor, and begged that if it should be
thought necessary to sack the city, his, Majesty would not sack the
coals. All idea of opposition to the advance of the Emperor was
abandoned, but the British consular passport office seemed to be fortified
by a tremendous weight of metal, in the shape of the tin pots and
saucepans in the window of the shop below. This, however,
merely by way of demonstration, for there was no intention on the p
of the consular authority to offer any opposition to the plans of
Emperor. The whole city, in fact, seemed prepared to place itself in
the hands of the invaders, and ºthere was scarcely an apartment that
might not have been taken by the first who approached.
The hotels and pastrycooks, expecting to be besieged, laid in an extra
supply of provisions for the besiegers, so that the surrender was
complete.
PUNCH AGAINST MAWWORM.
THE Sabbatarians pretend to retort upon Mr. Punch the charge of
wishing to take away ine Sunday of the people. Their morning journ
represents him as having “required” that “a poor cab-driver, after
toiling through, six days in the week, should be obliged to rise on
Sunday, like all the other days in the week, to clean his cab and his
horse, and to place himself on the stand, ready to convey Mr. Punch to
the Riº Railway.”
Mr. Punch begs to say that he “requires” that no cah driver,
whether poor or prosperous, should be “obliged” to do anything of
the kind. He extends this disavowal to the case of the “hundreds of
railway servants” whom he is supposed by the same journal to have
“calculated on finding at Waterloo station,” of the vehicles which it
alleges that he “demanded to find at the local station,” and the
taverns which it avers he “expected” would be open for him all day.
and all night.
All that Mr. Punch “requires” and “demands” is that iſ he wants
a cab, a railway trip, or tavern accommodation on a Sunday, nobody, if
lº". shall be forbidden to supply his wants. Punch would be the
as
º in the world to wish to compel a Sabbatarian cabman,
a stoke
r, an engine-driver, a waiter, a chambermaid, or any body else,
to labour upon his account on their day of rest. Far be from him the
idea of forcing conscientious publicans of Sabbatarian principles to
keep their houses open on that day. Mr. Punch respects the sincere
conviction of everybody—even that of a convict. It is notorious that
Mr. Punch would no more scruple to eat a salmon-cutlet than a mutton-
chop on Friday. Yet if MR. Lucas were to resign his papal trum-
petership, and to set up the Wiseman's Hat Hotel, Tavern, and House
ºf Call for Jesuits, Mr. Punch would, with all his might, defend
MR. Lucas from being bound to provide animal food in general on a
day when he might think it his duty to let none of his guests have any
but fish. Mr. Punch only asks that those who choose shall be permitted
to do him reasonable service on Sundays. He holds that io be reason-
able service which is necessary to his enjoyment of healthfºlrecreation.
Surely he has as great a right to hire a cabinan, if he can get one, to
take him to the station, as a Duke has to be driven out by variegated
retainers, or a Bishop to be conveyed to Church by a mazarine
domestic.
Let Sunday be a day of rest—but rest is not inaction. Cricket is
rest to a journeyman tailor. To rest one set of muscles most effectually
we must move others. Overworked faculties are best relaxed by em-
ploying other faculties. The eye that is fatigued with brick-walls
should rest on green fields. But the rest—the salutary and effectual
rest—of the generality necessitates the labour of some. Suffer those to

ticular star does not shine. No more is heard of him, and the doors do
not even open. We congratulate those who escaped. But what sort
of actors are those who rely upon huge posting-bills to do for them
what is achieved for real artists by public recognition? We do not
remember ever seeing MR. Robson’s name in larger letters than those
of the ordinary affiche; yet that performer did, night after night;
crowd a London theatre. But MR. SUILivan, content to be slighted.”

We believe that unlucky box book-keepers have learned, by this time:
that, generally speaking, the larger the letters the smaller the “let,”
though we imagine that the converse of the proposition was not
proved true in MR. St. LLIVAN's case.

“NOW, CHARLEY! HERE’S THAT PRETTY ROUND HAT AGAIN–WE WILL HAVE A LOOK AT HER THIS TIME.”
MUCH AD0 ABOUT DIPLOMATIC NOTHING,
THE KING of PRussia has earned a name for himself, and so has
the EMPEROR of AUSTRIA, by the line of behaviour which they have
pursued towards the CzAR. #. names which they have respectively
earned are Dogberry and Werges. As Peace Officers of Europe, they call
upon NICHOLAs to submit to certain conditions. NICHOLAs laug s at
them ; and they determine to-let him alone. They charge themselves,
as Dogberry did his watch, to “comprehend” a “yagrom.” man; to
wit, the CzAR. . Unfortunately, “a will not stand,” and accordingly
as Dogberry advises in such case, º "take no note of him.” Instead
of that, as further recommended by the same authority, they “presently
call the rest of the watch” (the Bund) “together,” and in their hearts,
doubtless, “thank God” they “are rid of a knave.”
The parallel seems perfect. The only difficulty is to settle which
shall be Dogberry and which Werges. Dogberry, to be sure, when called
an ass, answers, “Dost thou not suspect my years?” but then he re-
presents his colleague as “an old man, Sir,” adding, “and his wits
are not so blunt, as, GoD help, I would desire they were:” whence it
appears that Werges is the elder fool. Both, to be sure, are dotards;
but a young actor often plays old men: and on the stage of Europe
FRANÇis Joseph, at present, personates feebleness and imbecility to
the life. To him, therefore, we must assign the character of Dogberry;
and “suspecting his years” less than those of FREDERICK WILLIAM,
allot to the Prussian monarch that of Werges.
Dogberry describes himself as “a fellow that hath had losses.”

by degrees” until it is “beautifully less” than enough for a moderate
man's breakfast. In consequence of this state of things an attorney of
our acquaintance, who . to treat himself to one of the above-men-

DONALD IN THE EAST.
OUR northern friends will be delighted to hear that the Highlanders
have achieved a great triumph in Turkey. In an extract from a letter
from the Black Sea, published by the Morning Post, it is related of
those gallant Scots, that *
“When they were reviewed before the Sultan he seemed quite confounded with
their strange appearance, but when, to complete it, they suddenly struck up the bag-
pipes, he quite lost all his gravity, and burst out in the most violent fits of laughing in
spite of himself, for it is contrary to all notions of Turkish etiquette to laugh, much
more to do so in public.”
Glory to the Gaël! They have conquered the gravity of a Turk, and
will doubtless achieve as easy a victory over any number of Russians.
The same letter states that the Turks “follow them about the streets,
and seem both amazed and delighted with their strange dress.” It
may be expected that they will astonish the forces of Russia even more
effectually, though less eably, than they have astonished the natives
of º: and that the former will run away from them faster than the
latter follow them. This happy result will probably be much expedited
by their favouring their enemies with some of that music with which
they obliged the Sultan. In aid of a charge of bayonets, the best
imaginable means to disconcert an enemy must be a concert of bag-
pipes.
An Honest Clergyman.
THE newspapers say that the REv. MR., late ARCHDEAcon, WILBER-
FoRCE, having arrived at certain conclusions at variance with the articles
of the Church of England, has placed the resignation of his preferments
in the hands of his #. Such being the fact it is to be hoped that so
eminent an act of honour and honesty will prove a beneficial example
in that truly bumble station—that station of the deepest theoretical
humility—which this good man occupies.
A SIGN of THE TIMEs.-Such is the mercantile spirit, and at the
same time the intellectual poverty of the present day, that a number of
gentlemen in the city have put their heads together to see whether they
cannot get up amongst them a Joint Stock Association of IDEAs.

rude enough just now to stop the Bishop of Oxford, in a very good
to ask his lordship whether he knew that QUEEN ANNE was dead. But
Saponaceous SAMUEL is very good-natured—to me at least—and
took it well enough.
“There are no politics now, of course. But I happen to know that
there has been a good deal of uncomfortableness in the Cabinet, and
there will be a split before long. LoRD JoHN is now most eager for a
ºpeerage, but the PRINCE Consort (and perhaps a higher personage)
ºthinks that a peerage ought not to be conceded to him before the PRINCE
of WALEs comes of age, and the proper allowance is obtained from
Parliament. Lord PALMERStoN, who is very much attached to Lord
John Russell, offered to pledge himself to get this done in the most
liberal manner, if the latter were ennobled at once, and the affair was
“deemed so nearly arranged, that Lord John Russell, and his lad

very distinguished lady, filling a high office at court, assured me, in

“Talking of pictures, I heard a capital story of SIR Edwin L. the

“The marriage between a young Marquis in your county, and a fair
charmer whose ancestral seat is not a hundred miles from Birmingham,

that MR. GLADstone and MR. DISRAELI are in continual and jocular
correspondence on the financial measures for Easter, and that they even
met at the Lord Warden Hotel, Dover, and had a jolly evening, under
|pretext of discussing a tax on fish. Mr. DISRAELI is writing a new
novel, called Bolingbroke, some of which he read to MR. GLADSTONE on
that occasion, and the latter helped him to some Latin mottoes for his
chapters. Yet these two men will, in February next, assailore another
with all the skill and ferocity of gladiators. Such is life!. Besides the
tax I have hinted at, I am told, by the SECRETARY-At-WAR, that we
are to have an impost on shirts, on balloons, and on second editions of
books. Playbills are to bear a penny stamp, and oysters, other than
natives, will be taxed two pence a dozen. The newspaper stamp will
be taken off, but an ad calorem duty will be imposed on the articles
contributed to journals. If writings are to be taxed in p rtion to
their value, I doubt whether you will be able to afford to keep your
present London Correspondent, from whom no more at present.”

The World's Estimate.
Estmates generally have one half-knocked off when they come to
be revised, and it is mostly the same with moral as with commercial
estimates. No one is taken at his own estimate; so if you wish to be
considered clever, you must pretend to be twice as clever as you are,
and then the world will give you credit for one half of it.

HOW TO GET A CONNECTION.
Shopman (to Ancient Party). “Yes Miss–THANK You Miss–Is THERE ANY origh
ARTICLE Miss?–CAN we send IT For You Miss?”
[Old Lady thinks it such a nice shop, and such well-behaved young men.
CORNISH WRESTLERS WITH FAMINE.
May the effects of the late abundant harvest be felt to
the Land's End; may they at least be felt at Helstone,
Cornwall! At that place there exist institutions, the printed
dietary of which is now under our nose: and we may say
that it suggests but little of the fragrance of osmazome, or
the savoury principle of animal food. It allows the in-
mates of those institutions, men and women, just three
ounces of cooked meat a-piece once a week. The estab-
lishments in question might hence be supposed to be
monasteries conducted upon almost purely vegetarian
principles: and when we add, on the authority of the docu-
ment already mentioned, that the weekly cost of each
individual resident in them, for food, clothing, and neces-
saries, per head, is one shilling and tempence, it will be
inferred that fasting, evenin respect of split , is practised
with rigour, and luxury in apparel mortified almost to the
length of nudity. However, these abodes of privation are
British Protestant workhouses: and certainly there is less
reason for us, to laugh at the friars, for macerating them-
selves, than there is for them to laugh at us for macerating
the aged and infirm poor.
Put a Poor Law Commissioner for one week under the
regimen and discipline of the Helstone Workhouses, and
how much would he lose in weight at the end of it? . It is
a pity this experiment is not tried, for the Commissioners
of the Poor Law have sanctioned the above arrangements,
| and might as well learn, by º the effect of them
- on the human frame. This would, anyhow, be doing some-
thing for their money, namely, for an ample yearly salary,
which they receive for the not very laborious, nor perhaps
- to them disagreeable, employment of paring down the
| comforts of those who are unable to earn any wages at all.
They would then be in a position to commiserate the
Helstone º if not to help them. For perhaps these
are Paupers of Paupers; the whole district poverty stricken:
and those inhabitants of it who can maintain themselves
subsisting chiefly on potatoes. In that case, let us hope
that the harvest will at least give them all bread enough,
if it will not afford those who are in the workhouses another
weekly toothful of meat.

BELLA, HORRIDA BELLA
... WE perceive that at the recent meeting of the Archaeological Societ
in Wiltshire, “the REveREND MR. Lukes read a paper on Bells.
We have seen no report of this amusing_production, but we can fancy
! the rich º: the subject must have afforded. We can imagine the
Reverend Gentleman commencing with a º: into the diving bell,
then seizing the street door bell, and sudden y running off to #. the
dustman's bell for a few moments in hand. We can conceive his taking
a passing hold of the º bell, and then darting off abruptly in the
direction of the muffin bell with which he might hold a sort of sportive
dalliance. . His next step would probably be in the direction of the
bell-fry, where he would wind up with a hearty pull at the bell-ropes,
and leave us with the subject still ringing in our ears. We understand
the whole company consented to act as clappers, for the paper was
received with much applause.

in the order in which we have given them. We hate to use strong ex-
pressions, but we are inclined to fear that the second advertiser is a Brute.
GREY PARROT LOST-Flew away from a villa in St. John's Wood,
on Tuesday afternoon, a lovely Grey Parrot. Is full of playfulness, and though
its articulation is indistinct, it will scream and screech in the most enthusiastic manner
for hours together. Any one who has found it is earnestly prayed to treat the dear
thing kindly, and not to resent its biting, and, on bringing it tº its disconsolate mistress,
the reward of Three Guineas shall be thankfully paid. Address MRs. DE Popperts,
Acroceraunia Cottage, St. John's Wood.
REY PARROT LOST.—Flew away from a villa in St. John's Wood,
on Tuesday afternoon, a Grey Parrot. May be known by its viciousness, its not
speaking a word, and its habit of screeching in the most abominable manner, without
any reason whatever. Any one who has found it, and will bring it—stuffed—to the
undermentioned address, shall receive Four Guineas, and thanks. Address MR. Dr
Poppetts, Acroceraunia Cottage, St. John's Wood.
THE FLOWERS OF THE ARMY.
oME Regiments,
we believe, are
called, par ercel-
lence, “the Flower
of the Army:”
and we certainly
can see no reason
: this floral
style of nomen-
clature should
not be applied to
our troops more
particularly: thus
we cannot see
why the younger
branches of the
service should not
in future assume
the title of the
Greens; while all
the more than
ordinarily dissi-
pated regiments
might with equal
H. be talked of as the Seeds. In allusion to their trowsers, the
ussars should henceforth rank as the Pinks (of perfection); and the
red-coated Light Infantry, who are accoutred so heavily that they can
barely walk, might, in playful irony be called the Scarlet Runners;
whilst the popular “ Guards” sº be described as the Dandy Lions.
Qn the same principle (or want of it) the oblivious 46th should hence-
forth, in this military “Language of Flowers” be lucus-à-nonically
known as the Forget-Me-Nots.

-MARTIAL JUSTICE FOR THE MILLION.
E understand that the fol-
lowing important obser-
vations were addressed by
Major Short of the 146th
Buffs to a select civil and
military Circle :-
... “I tell you what, Sir.
The result of that PERRY's
trialis a deuced good thing.
I don’t care whether the
sentence was right or
wrong; it has been con-
firmed: and there's an end
of it. The good thingis, it
has shown we may do what
ºwe think-proper,” [by
“we,” the gallant Major
is supposed to have meant
the British Army as repre-
sented by its ruling spirits]
*and set public opinion at
defiance. "It has shown,
Sir, that we need not care
a dash for that dashed
Press. The merits-of-the
case were not the question.
The question was, whether
the officers of a Court Martial and a Commander-in-Chief would allow
ºthemselves to be dictated to by a set of newspaper men; a parcel of
dashed fellows, a set of rascals and vagabonds, by Jove, Sir, who get
their living by their wits. Perhaps PERRY was an ill-used lad...I dare
say he was. By Jove, Sir, so much the better. The dashed public will
ºnow know that we are not to be controlled by clamour, even if there is
ground for it. This is the case, Sir:-The members of the Court Martial
say to one another, “This is a bad business. But we’ve begun it, and
by Joye we must go through with it. Between ourselves, we’ve made a
mistake; but we musn't be intimidated into owning we’re in the wrong.
That will never do.’ So they deliver their sentence, and when if comes
before Lord HARDINGE, he says the same thing. By Jove,’ he says,
‘these fellows have been in an awkward position. But there was only
one course for them to take, and they took it, and I must support them
in that course, by Jove.’ So his Lordship goes to the Quºx and
advises HER MAJESTY to confirm the sentence. HER MAJESTY
objects, the Commasper-In-CHIEF says—with all the proper and
necessary respect—"Ma'am, by Jove, you must.” So the sentence is
confirmed, and the fellow is sent about his business. By Jove, I think
it's a pity he was allowed to sell his commission. The example, to the
ress I mean, and the Public would have been better if he had been
cashiered outright. Now, Sir, another thing. The success that
authority has been asserted with in this affair shows that wenight have
a deuced deal better Government than we have at present. Any fellow
that is troublesome, don't stand on ceremony with him-don't be
particular about forms of trial+get a jury that will find him guilty
without boggling; and then tie him up and well lick him: or hang him
on the next tree. "There would be a great outcry, perhaps, and hulla-
balloo, but what would that signify?, Qrifit did, you might soon stop
it by shooting half-a-dozen of those dashed Editors, or stringing them
up over their own office doors. Show public opinion that you’ve got
force on your side, and are determined to use it, and by Jove, Sir, public
opinion will knock under. Look around you, Sir, and see what has
been dore in foreign countries. The same thing might be done here;
and a deuced goodthing too. You’ve crammed this Court Martial down
their throats, Sir: so much for a beginning. As to the treatment of
PERRy, just or unjust, there's an end of the matter.”
These remarks, listened to attentively throughout, weregreeted at the
conclusion with approving laughter, and cries of “Bravo Major!”
though a doubt was whispered among some of the civilians, whether
the gallant officer was not, and would not be till after the meeting of
Parliament, a little too hasty in saying that the matter had ended.

Then wherefore should I interfere,
While Russian exports, thank blockade,
Can only find an outlet here?
Excavation Arrºn meaning Mr. Patwork's pengurru, Book:
-“Save us from being either your friend or your enemy; but
especially the former.”
WHAT ON EARTH HAS HE DONE
THE following paragraph from one of the daily papers has rather
startled us. It is headed DR. PEITHMAN!
“DR. PEITHMAs, whose intrusion into the Chapel of Buckingham Palace was reported
in the journals a few weeks since, was sent to *... after examination before the
Police Magistrate. By the active interference of MR. Pºnceval, son of the late Prime
Minister, and the Rev. Dr. Enterron, principal of Hanwell College, aided by the good
feeling of some of the Middlesex Magistrates, he has been liberated; but only upon
the condition of his leaving the country. This he did on Saturday week with Mr.
Peaceval, who will accompany him to Germany.”
Several of what the authorities might callyery impertinent questions
crowd upon us after reading this paragraph:-First, What has DR,
PEITH MAN done? Secondly, Why send him to a lunatic asylum ? and
Thirdly, If it was proper to send him there, why take him out again?
Fourthly, If it was proper to release him Nº. him by orderi
him out of the country? Fifthly, Why has R. Perceval, ºi
himself with DR: Peitman? But we might go on asking questions
º etermity on this very questionable paragraph, which discloses no
other offence on the part of the Doctor than his having attended divine
service uninvited in the chapel of Buckingham Palace.
FRIENDLY ADVICE.
To the EMPERoR or ALL THE Russias, greeting, Punch would say
That for cruel and despotic Czarsfull long has set the day:
The world with years has wiser grown, and now will tolerate
No government but that which in its laws is moderate.
That tyranny is suicidal history will show:
A nation's vengeance, once aroused, is sure, however slow ;
From furthest age the darkest page in clearest proofs is strong
That the monarchy called absolute is absolutely wrong.
'Tis true that many an instance the good old times afford
Of nations trampled underfoot, and Might o'er Right the lord;
Yet many a proof of nation’s wrath might even then have shown
That power bought with others’ blood is paid for with its own.
Small pains to tell how NERo fell, of crueltyrants worst,
Qr how they slew, CALigula, by every Roman cursed;
Or how the vile DomitiaN, who profaned the name of lord,
Yet found his mock divinity no shield against the sword.
Nor were it hard to bring the proof a little nearer home,
For tyrants fall in Russia, e'en as tyrants fell in Rome;
Bear witness, PAUL, beneath whose thrall a nation suffered long,
Yet proved at length a nation’s strength could expiate its wrong.
Then Nicholas, be warned in time, learn prudence from the past,
Beisure the worm, long undertrodden, yet will turn at last;
Though one may rule o'er many, and believe their spirit gone,
Yet, in the end, the many prove too many for the one.
THE CHARACTER OF DANDO, THE GREATOYSTER
EATER:-AN ELEGANT*ExTRAct.
*This greatman died unknown, his greatness almost unacknowledged. And yet he
was a genius in his line, if everthere was one.-He-discovered an opening, where no
one else did. The world to him was literally an oyster, and he opened it with his sword
in the shape of a clasp-knife. He devoured oysters as easily as other men breathed.
His fame filled England-as-his-exploits-filled the newspapers. Not a pºlice office
where he was not as well-known as the magistrate.-He was a Casan, before whose
conquering sword thousands and thousands of natives fell; and will it be believed, it
was the fashion to despise, to sneer at this bivalvian conqueror, because it was his proud
custom not to pay for the natives that everyday he sacrificed to his insatiable-hunger
and ambition? This mighty Hansraal-for he was as mighty as Hannºnan, cutting
himself a path through Fame with a vinegar bottle-was subjected to every contumely:
He was cuffed, collared, locked up, imprisoned, fined, sent to the treadmill! And all
because he would not pay for the paltry-bread-and-butter he had consumed! How
many persons, I should like to know, are in the habit of paying for their pats and
loaves—their quarterns, and pounds of Dorset?--Is it not well-known that, in this
miserable-ºnation of shopkeepers, there are hundreds of noblemen who owe hundreds
ot-pounds to their bakers, and hundreds more to their buttermongers? How many
men are there in this haughty England that are not in the debt of their fishmonger, if
not for oysters, at all events for salmon, for red-mullet, turbot, prawns, or whitebait.
Oysters were a want, a craving, a fated necessity of Daxpo's nature. It is wrong to
say he did an injury to the shops where he loved most to eat them. Granted—that he
did not pay for the many dozens hereould comfortably stow away at one-sitting—still
was the fame of his having been to that shop to be considered nothing? Was his
patronage nothing? was not the name of Dando more than sufficient compensation for
any paltry little bill that might be brought up against him? In any other country
but England, where shopkeepers make the laws, and where characters are nailed to the
counter as relentlessly as bad shillings, DANDo would have been made a great man.
But the day will come when a monument will be erected to his memory higher than
any grotto, and the very oyster-shells that in his lifetime he threw carelessly away
will be collected carefully together for the purpose of raising it. Then, when full
justice is rendered to the injured character of the Great Dawoo, will this poºr eulogy
of mine shine, like the votive offering of a tallow-candle, brightly inside it!”-from
a private copy of “Parmone's Friends and Acquaintances."

a horrible smell proceeded from the justice-
ODOUR.
A Few days ago, the LoRD MAYoR created
a fearful sensation by walking on to the Bench
in the Mansion, House, and declaring that such
room as to render it impossible for the LADY
MAYokess to º a dance in the ball-room
above, without the fear of suffering from the
vapours. In consequence of the excessively
disagreeable smell proceeding from the adminis-
tration of justice down stairs, nobody can tolerate
the atmosphere of the room above; and the
LoRD MAYoſt has therefore decided on turning
his tribunal into a closed court, trapping it, as
MR. Nichols recommends we should trap our
drains.
We can only regret that this measure should
be necessary, for we think justice should not be
administered with closed skylights any more than
with closed doors. . If there is no other object in
view than to enable the LADY MAYoress to
dance in comfort in the ball-room above, we
would suggest that her ladyship's dancing days
must be pretty well over—at least for the present
season—as we hear of no balls at the Mansion
House; and we cannot suppose that the Queen
of the City is so infatuated with the amusement,
that she remains in London, executing an oc-
casional passeul, while all the rest of the world
is out of town. -

As the Tiger is the only prize the Russians

natural perhaps that they should try to make

COMMON SENSE IN REGIMENTALS.
THANKs to the war, common sense has lately had unusual influence with our military
authorities, and “ease before elegance” is to be henceforth the order of the day. In their
race for glory, our soldiers will no longer be so heavily weighted, and their arms in future
will be rather more reasonably proportioned to their legs. Troops on active service will
have a better chance allowed them of displaying their activity, and the feat of “standing
at ease” in their regimentals will cease to be viewed as an impossible attainment. Time
and the Times have happily exploded the old martinet theory, that to make a useful soldier
ſou must begin by .* strangling him; nor will our men, in order to look smart on parade,
any more prevented by tight §: from being “smart” on service.
But while reforming our soldiers’ clothing, the authorities, it appears, have not exactly acted
upon Hamlet's principle, and “reformed it altogether.” A recent paragraph informs us that—
“Sealed patterns of new uniforms have been received at the Horse Guards, and are now under consideration. In
all of them, we understand, there is very considerable alteration as to cut; but as far as we can learn there will be
little, if any, change in point of colour.”
We suppose it is from mere force of habit that the British army so persists in sticking
to its colours, else we should fancy there are not many in the service but would be
glad to have the brickdust shaken from their coats. In trowsers, too, we are not our-
selves particular to a shade, but we cannot think that exactly a becoming one, which makes
I’m
the, bearer look as though he literally had been
walking into cherry tart. Such pantaloons we
think, are only fit for a pantomime, and must
elsewhere be regarded as breaches of good sense.
For soldiers who have sometimes to lie in
ambuscade, any clothing is absurd which tends
to make them conspicuous; and we cannot help
thinking that our military authorities would be
puzzled to . adduce a colourable pretext for
putting their men in such a coloured dress as
only renders them the better mark for the ridicule
of their friends, and the rifles of their enemies.
A PRE-SCIENTIFIC PEER.
. Poor LORD DERby appeared, at the Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science at Liver-
pool, and there—before the wise ones of the
earth-amented his ignorance with a fund
of humour. He had been born in dark times,
before the lights of science had dawned. He
|presented himself as a specimen of nobleman
º and was received as a remarkable
|addition to the large stock already on hand.
|PROFEssoR Owen pointed out to the com-
|pany the peculiar characteristics presented in
the noble Earl; and called upon his audience
to mark, and reflect upon the development of
the moral qualities that, when put forth under a
coronet, may exert an extraordinary fascination
upon mankind in general; when, in fact, without
the coronet, the influence of the animal might
even to the most sagacious of men, have remaine
altogether unacknowledged. The learned Pro-
fessor next called the attention of the assembly
to the pouch, or pocket, of the specimen before
him; observing that, if time permitted, he could
show the extraordinary powers of the specimen,
latent in their . and existing in aurife-
rous secretions, that, with such organisations,
must continue to have a most noble influence
upon all surrounding bodies. The Professor was
continuing these profound speculations, when
the noble specimen of a pre-scientific age, broke
from his hands; and struck up a comic song.
We have only room for the last stanza; whic
was sung in jig time, the members of the Asso-
ciation all joining in chorus:
“Here stands with head of coroneted earth,
An Earl to quartz and mastodons unknown;
A golden spoon did feed him at his birth—
And Whig and Tory marked him for their own.”
The noble Earl made such an impression upon
the audience in general, that more than one of
the Liverpool council was heard to remark that
“after all, the real, condescending, hearty igno-
rance of a true nobleman was worth all the
bothering knowledge of a bundle of professors.”
A very melancholy opinion for the º to
reflect on! But then, how very brilliant igno-
rance must be when it is embedded in fifty
thousand a-year !
INCREASE OF ALDERMEN.
In describing the livery of MR. AIDERMAN
MuggeRIDGE, one of the Sheriffs elect, the
Morning Post says:
“Pendant from the left shoulder, from a chastely-executed
shoulder-badge, is a plaited egleattaire, the badge represent-
ing, in exquisite embroidery work, the arms of the worthy
| alderman, with the motto—' Dat Deus incrementum.'"
As a text looks rather out of place on , a
shoulder-badge, would it not be as well to make
a slight alteration in this motto, which would
secularise it, and at the same time render it more
appropriate; namely, by the change of a single
word; thus: “Dat testado incrementum,”—“The
turtle gives the increase?” We are not acquainted
with the dimensions of MR. MUGGERIDGE ; but
surely his motto would derive, from the substi-
tution proposed, a peculiar fitness for the livery
of an Alderman.

THE PRINCEss LIEven has returned to her old quarters
in Brussels, having sojourned awhile in certain of the
Rhenish provinces, where, it is understood, she has proved
of the greatest assistance and consolation to the KING OF
PRUssia. “The women are the best judges, after all,” says
SIR FRETFUL; and there can be no doubt that women
make the best war ministers. No coats like petticoats.
The KING of PRussia is a philosopher, and therefore open,
as a housebreaker, to conviction. Thus counselled by the
PRINCEss LIEVEN, Prussia's Monarch has presented to the
world that inflexible countenance for doing nothing that
for nothing will, to alſ posterity, make him especially re-
markable. His Alº has been right royally grateful;
and, in a confidential letter, written in zebra’s milk, has
presented PRINCEss LIEvºN with the Colonelcy of the
Prussian Blues. For obvious reasons, the PRINCEss will
not appear at the head of her regiment until the conclusion
of the present.unhappy war. In the meantime she will live
near Brussels. A charming country house has been taken
for her, with an extensive garden attached. It is said that
the PRINCEss intends to give her best energies to the culti-
vation of Brussels sprouts, with a view to acclimating that
very green and marrowy vegetable in Russia.

the hand-writing. It is SIR CHARLEs NAPIER's, and it was sent home
from, the Baltic in a red envelope, by the Colombo transport, now at
Woolwich. As soon as it appeared, i. AbeBDEEN drove off in a
rage to Printing-House Square, and demanded that every word of it

“HER MAJESTY sent over an autograph letter by PRINCE ALBERT to
Louis NAPOLEoN, with which the latter was much pleased. I did not
see it, but I have reason to think that I am pretty well aware of the

they were simply to say that HER MAJESTY had no hesitation in

| But now comes a statement in the Pope’s “Encyclical Letter,
wherefrom we are quoting, which is really unkind.

“And this is even especially to be lamented, that among so many evils and misfor-
tunes, which can never be º, deplored, the children of darkness, who are wiser
in their generation than the children of light, struggle more and more every day with
all kinds of diabolical frauds, artifices, and efforts, to wage a most bitter war against
the Catholic Church and its salutary doctrine, to pull down and destroy the authority
of all legitimate power, to corrupt and deprave the minds and intellect of all, to propa-
gate on all sides the deadly poison of indifferentism and incredulity, to confuse all rights,
Divine and human, to stir up dissensions, discords, and the commotions of impious re-
bellion, to encourage all kinds of depravity, and the most cruel crimes, and to leave
nothing untried, so that, if it were possible, our most holy religion might be obliterated
from the midst of us, and human society overturned from its foundation.”
Now this, we repeat, is unkind. Not unkind to us. No. We have
laughed at winking statues and we have repudiated CARDINAL Wise-
MAN: let the Pope, therefore, call us impious, and apply to us all the
opprobrious epithets that he thinks in his conscience and charity that
we deserve. Not to us, not to QUEEN VICTORA, do we charge his
Holiness with unkindness; not to the British Public and its Sovereign,
but to the French and their Emperor. Are not flouis Napoleon and
his subjects in the same scrape as we are; chasised with the same

The papal invective, however, makes no exceptions. Clergymen of the
Pope's persuasion generally sprinkle their holy water judiciously, by
means of a delicate species of besom, but Pius appears to scatter his
aspersions with a mop, which he trundles in such a violent indiscriminate
manner as to fling his slops into the face of everybody.
A GLUT OF GREAT TRAGEDIANS.
__ Though the Shakspearean
º market is at a low
ebb in town, it
appears to be well
supplied, if not
absolutely over-
stocked, in the
}. Though
nqon has scarce-
ly an actor that
may be called a
tragic performer,
the country seems
to be overflowing
with “eminent tra.
gedians.” It is true
that we should re-
main in blissful
ignorance of the ex-
istence of most of
these “great crea-
tures,” if it were
not for their own
advertisements in
the Times, whose
columns teem daily with the self-assertions of histrionic genius. It is
rather tantalising to the London lover of the high drama to find that
the representatives of the high heroic school of acting can get no nearer
to the metropolis than some little Pedlington or...other, where they
are, however, “open to further engagements.” We had only just re-
covered from the perusal of the recent advertisements of the “eminent
DILLON" and the “renowned Pitt,” when an entirely new star shines
forth with the startling announcement that
“MR. BUTLER WERTworth is about to return to the stage. He will perform at the
Theatre Royal, Whitehaven, in the characters of, &c. &c., to the 20th of October, after
which he will be open to further engagements.”
Now we have nothing to say against the merits of any or all of these
gentlemen, who may be wandering GARRicks as far as we know, but as
we never saw any one of them, while of some we actually never heard,
we are somewhat surprised at their coming suddenly down upon us as
“eminent tragedians.” If those gentlemen who favour us from time
to time with advertisements of their “eminence” and their “great-
mess,” will only persuade the London managers to exhibit those much-
wanted qualities on the London stage, we shall be among the first to
hail their advent as a new era in theatrical history.
ROMANCE AND REALITY OF THE WIWANDIERE.
The Cockney tourists at Boulogne have been much disappointed at
the sight of the real vivandière, who is more like an old gentleman in
blue petticoats and red trousers than those smart young ladies who
figure on the . of quadrilles, and polkas in the music shops.
The principal vivandière at the French camp looks as if she had seen,
not only some twenty summers, but at least forty autumns, and, to
judge by her frosty hair, an equal number of winters. Instead of re-
sembling La Figlia, the old lady in question is more like La Madre del
Reggimento. JENNY LIND has created such a belle idéale of the Pican-
dière, that our sentimentality receives a a frightful smash, when the real
object makes her appearance, with a face full of wrinkles, highlows
full of nails, and a mouth full of French slang of the least recherché
character.

portion of the hind legs of a horse (reasonably considered by one of our
most eminent antiquaries to be Pegasus), may be foun ". feet
below the old Excise Office. And should such a discovery be made, we
may predicate with certainty that “that indefatigable virtuoso Mr.
Roach SMITH" will hasten to secure the treasure for the civic museum;
but will find, on arriving at the spot, that the discoverer, an honest
navigator of the name of Sykes, after in vain endeavouring to sell the
priceless relic for eighteenpence, has, in extreme disgust, chopped it up
with his pickaxe. -
“Now barrows yawn, and cairns give up their” torques, or other
conventional contents. Now, too, the º: possessor of the house in
Aldgate, beneath which stands an Early English chapel, makes the
seventy-eighth annual discovery of that recondite fact. For the seventy-
eighth time it is communicated to the daily papers; and once more an
accurate drawing of the chapel, taken (on the spot) from the Gentle-
man's Magazine of December, 1772, appears in an illustrated journal.
This year, however, our archaeological penny-a-liners have gone
further afield, and, in company with CAPTAIN NewENHAND, “our Ad-
miralty agent,” have discovered the “ruins of that Alexandrian Library
which was burnt by the CALIPH QMAR,” They are confident of the
fact, because the Captain discovered the “remains of a building,” and
“masses of double columns;” which, to be sure, must have been the
columns of the Memphis Gazette, or Thebes Intelligencer. They go on to
say: “An immense block of blue granite was . dug out, weighing
several tons, and covered with, º.; Coptic letters. The Captain
was unable to obtain a tracing of these letters.”
It was at once evident to Mr. Punch that a mass, of the described
colour and density, could only be vitrified Blue-books; and he im-
mediately applied to SAID PASHA for permission to make that transcript
which the Captain had been unable to effect, and it is unnecessary to
say that the SAID PASHA readily gave the said permission to the said
Punch. At present the eminent scholars whom Mr. Punch has em-
loyed have only been able to translate a portion of a “Report from the
ommissioners appointed to convey the god APIs from Nubia” (where
tº: had purchased him) “to Memphis.”
e appears to have been of the short-horned breed, and it is ve
interesting to know that he had been brought up “on 12,000lb. of oil-
cake, 10 tons of turnips, and 40 fodder of hay,” and that ere he reached
the place of exhibition he travelled eight hundred miles on ſoot (during
which journey, the commissioners whopped him unmercifully), and two
hundred and thirty in a car decorated with flowers, and drawn by relays
of fellahs—i.e. of any fellers whom the commissioners could press into
the service.
Doings in the Hop Markets.
AN immense deal of business has been done lately at the new Hop
Markets, or cheap dancing shops, of which there are several in every
quarter of the town. These hop markets are chiefly frequented by the
#. who have not yet done growing, and who are still quite green.
e produce is considerable, and indeed there are inlow neighbourhoods
some Hop Markets where pockets are at all times being picked by
those who may be said to have their hand in, whenever an opportunity
OCCurs.

THE partial power that to the female race
Is charged to apportion gifts of form and grace,
With liberal hand moulds beauty's curves in
one,
And to another gives as good as none:
But woman still for nature proves a match,
And grace by her denied, from art will snatch.
Hence, i. ELIZA, grew thy farthingales;
Hence, later ANNA, swelled thy hoops' wide

To this we must refer the use of stays; "
Nor less the bustle of more modern days.
Artful device whose imitative pad
Into good figures roundeth off the bad—
Whether of simple sawdust thou art seen,
Or tak'st the guise of costlier crinoline—
How oft to thee the female form doth owe
A grace rotund, a line of ampler flow,
Than flesh and blood thought fit to clothe it
with below !
There dwelt in Liverpool a worthy dame,
Who had a friend—JAMES TAYLOR was his
name. -
He dealt in glass, and drove a thriving trade,
And still saved up the profits that he made,
Till when a daughter blest his marriage bed,
The father in the savings-bank was le
In his child's name a small sum to invest,
From which he drew the legal interest.
Years went and came ; JAMEs TAYLOR came
- and went ;
Paid in, and drew, his modest three per cent,
Till, by the time his child reach'd girlhood’s
bounds,
The sum had ris’n to two-and-twenty pounds.
Our cautious legislature—well 'tis known—
Round savings-banks a guardian fence has
thrown:
'Tis easy to pay into them, no doubt,
Though anything but easy to draw out.
And so JAMES TAYLOR found; for on a day
He wanted twenty pounds a bill to pay,
And, short of cash, unto the bank applied;
Failing some form of law, he was denied'

So let me use the pseudonym of Jon Es);
“TAYLOR,” said MRs. Jones, “as I’m a friend,

of MR. CHARLEs KEAN, which is excessively unpleasant when it is not
exact, and is still more so when it is:
ºntº UK'ſberras it has also been the habit for several months past, of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A QUEER GUIDE TO GOVERNMENT SITUATIONS.
It has been dimly evident to the British Public for some months
ast, that the “Civil Servants of the Crown,” (with which mouth-
ãº title Government clerks eke out their scanty emoluments,) have
acquired an “organ” of their own—an organ, too, with a trumpet stop
of such peculiar power as to tempt the performers to a frequent use of
it. Of this organ, however, the British public would probably not be
cognisant were it not that certain hebdomadal paragraphs, purporting
to contain the latest intelligence of vacancies and appointments in
Government offices, are rather greedily appropriated by its con-
temporaries.
From these paragraphs the public may learn how T. PERcy Jones,
Deputy Assistant Tidewaiter, has at length been overtaken by “that
tide in the affairs of men” for which he has so long been waiting, and
which has now taken him on the flood and borne him on to be an
Assistant Tidewaiter. Thence we learn too (under the head of Customs)
that there are as many “classes of clerks for general business in
London,” as there were circles in DANTE's Inferno—and we may trace
the progress, painful and slow, of many BRow Ns and GREENs towards
the giddy heights of first class and £300 per annum.
It is not generally known, and Mr. Punch rather prides himself upon
the discovery, that the hebdomadai announcements of vacant appoint-
ments are concocted by contumacious “Civil Servants,” who well
know what trouble will thence ensue to the chiefs of their several
departments. . But though not generally known, this will be generally
understood, when it is stated that on the last intimation that there was
a vacancy for a third class probationary clerk in the Subsorting depart-
ment of the General Post Office, no less than 394 country curates
(whose united families comprised 4855 persons), 478 widows (whose
united incomes amounted to £8567 13s. 4d.), and 832 lieutenants in
the Navy (who had served in the aggregate 4296 years, and had seen
13,676 juniors go over them), wrote urgently to entreat LoRD CANNING
to bestow the appointment “on one ". would never give him reason
to repent of the kindness he had shown to a distressed,”’ &c. &c. Some
idea of the labours of his Lordship's private secretary may be gleaned
from the fact that he was *. for three months, eight days, and
nine hours, in reading these applications, and that he wrote 1714 polite
notes setting forth that,
“Unfortunately the appointment had been filled up six days before the notice of the
vacancy had appeared in the public prints, and that indeed, as a rule, such valuable
appointments were not given away to the Public, but were reserved exclusively for
the eldest sons of such meritorious Civil servants as had been more than 50 years in
their respective posts."
Now Mr. Punch, who has designs of his own upon the Civil service
peruses these weekly announcements with the greatest attention, an
very much surprised was he to read a few days since the following
startling notice:
“The appointment of Postmaster of Bath is vacant, caused by the death of MR.
MusgBAve; 4400 per annum, vice SMITH, in the gift of the Postmaster General.”
As far as the word “Musgrave” the sentence was sufficiently clear,
but after that word, the master of sentences himself could not fathom
its mystery. Does slavery then exist in England? Has the Post-
master General a serf named SMITH, whom he can devise at pleasure
like any other chattel? Who of all the SMITHs? But, No! that way
madness lay. Mr. Punch could not pº that inquiry. Still, how-
ever, there were the tempting words “f 100 per annum vice SMITH, in
the gift of the Postmaster General.” Of course if he were free to
choose, Mr. Punch would take £400 per annum vice SMITH, but how
the Postmaster General could be so mad as to retain SMITH vice £400
r
#. assed a sleepless night, and on the morrow in his extreme wrath
with the paragraph, which had so perplexed him, he reverted to the
words “caused by the death of MR. Musgrave,” and exclaimed:
“I'd give the lands of Deloraine
Dark MusgBAvs were alive again.”

THE WAR IN PARIS.
* ONSIDERING that the allies have not
hitherto been very active at the
Theatre of War, the French troops
have been tolerably busy at the
Theatres of Paris, and a consider-
able force is occupied three or four
times a week in resisting the Siege
of Silistria at the Hippodrome. The
whole proceeding is what might be
called in the despatches a “brilliant
affair,” and we have no doubt that
if the managers of the Cirque had
been entrusted with the management
of the whole campaign, the Rus-
sians would now be licking the dust
of Cronstadt as completely as they
are now licking the sand of the
arena outside the barrier of Paris.
The French are so essentially a
theatrical people that they require
a stage manager for their movements
in the field, as well as for their manoeuvres behind the footlights. If
MoNs. RoquePLAN had been sent out to the East with a sufficient staff
of maitres de ballet, and directors of the mise en scène, we should by
this time have seen the curtain ready to drop on a brilliant tableau
in which Russia would have been represente
% the spurs of the Gallic Game Cock and the claws of the
1On.
The Siege of Silistria is got up at the Hippodrome with such splendour
and effect that we doubt if the real thing could have been half so good
as the imitation; and it is quite certain that we have nothing in the
British army that can compare with the Scotch regiment of little men
with long black beards, which strikes terror into the Russians at the
Hippodrome.
In order to give as much reality as possible to the siege, the troops
are commanded by real French officers, who do not think it beneath
their dignity to take part in the “scenes in the circle,”, under the
guidance of some Parisian WIDDIcom B. We understand that several
gallant soldiers of high rank take part in the mimic Siege of Silistria–
an arrangement which could not be copied among ourselves, for we
can hardly imagine LoRD RAGLAN galloping backwards and forwards
on Astley's stage, or H. R. H. the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE dashing up a
platform on his richly caparisoned steed, and inviting six mounted
supernumeraries to follow him through the upper entrance O. P. side
to death or victory.
We think our French neighbours are a little premature in converting
Silistria already into a stage spectacle; and although the events now
passing will hereafter be read in those great pages of history—the
Astley's playbills—we think the War with Russia is not yet quite ripe
for the pen of the dramatist or the riding whip of WIDDIconi B, t
undying one.

CARDINAL WIRTUES IN A HAT.
IN an 'account recently of the death of CARDINAL MAI, we are told .
that “the Cardinalowed his hat to the high position which he had acquired
in the learned world.” º: at a Cardinal is almost as con-
spicuous for his red legs as his head-dress, we do not see why any
articular reference should be made to his hat, and why are we not
informed to what he owes his stockings? We object to all affectations
in phraseology, and we therefore enter our protest against the expres-
sion above quoted. If poor old BRIEFLEss were to die, we should be
greatly irritated if his biographer were to tell us that “he owed his wig
to the Benchers who called him to the Bar,” or that “he owed his
gown to the liberality of his robe-maker, who had never received—or
sued him for—a farthing of the money.” The fact is that CARDINAL
MAI did not owe his hat, or the price of his hat, to anybody but his
hatter. His elevation to the rank of Cardinal may have been owing to
his “position in the learned world,” but to confound his hat with his
rank is to allow the former to get a-head of the latter in a manner we
cannot approve.

“THE HAPPY PAIR THEN STARTED For THE CoNTINENT, via Folkestone,

(Lines for an Inscription on a Tablet.)
LET us go back; renounce the senses quite:
And altogether cease to place reliance
On reason, save as guided by the light
Of faith: let us abjure all human science,
And set all facts, but Rome, at mere defiance.
The earth stands still; it is the sun that moves;
Astronomy is only a delusion;
We therefore will not credit what it proves,
For both the premises, and the conclusion,
Are forged by demons, for our souls' confusion.
The powers of steam and electricity,
So-called, are diabolic emanations;
And all the curious arts of chemistry
Are, in effect, so many incantations,
Of sorcery the modern applications.
The stars are lamps suspended from the sky,
To light this world, placed there for that alone;
A solid is the blue expanse on high,
Tlat is this earth which we exist upon,
Antipodes beneath us there are none.
None, but the Prince of Darkness, and his crew,
Newton and GALILEo who include,
PRIESTLEY, and Wollaston, and DAvy too,
Who will be joined by all the wicked brood
Of your philosophers, that men delude.
Let us go back; consistent let us be:
All their discoveries outright deny
As magic frauds: and what we plainly See,
Flatly maintain to be an utter lie:
And—when we’re able—all gainsayers fry.

THE BROOKE TESTIMONIAL.
A CIRCU signed “John FUNKs,” or some such name, has been
forwarded to it."Punch it is dated from New Street, Birmingham,
and it “earnestly solicits” the recipient’s “subscription and influence,
made payable by cross check or otherwise,” to a fund for the purpose
of presenting “the above Eminent Actor with an appropriate memento
of the high sense entertained for him as a Man and an Actor.”
To a printed circular, Mr. Punch begs to answer in print, as
follows:– -
1st. That he does not know how to make his influence payable by
cross check or otherwise. - -
2ndly. That he has a general contempt for the whole Testimonial
system, and a special contempt for the system of canvassing in order to

THE Orangemen of Down have requested MR, DISRAELI to be their

the part of Moses. MR. DisrAELI has returned a very benign answer,
but it is plain from his response, that he is not at present prepared to
double the character of Moses, seeing there is just now such uncertainty
about the Prophets.
LEFT-OFF CLOTHES FOR AUSTRALIA 1 :
VERY day advertisements may be seen
in the papers, commencing with the
words at the head of this article.
Australia would seem to be in want
of a sort of Rag Fair, at which worn-
out wearing apparel may be obtain-
able. This is perhaps on account of
the new Constitution, which proposes
to adopt an aristocracy, and some
other of our old habits. The adver-
tisements to which we allude make
special mention of “Regimentals and
Court Suits,” as if it were in contem-
plation to establish in the Colonies
second-hand Court costumes, to be
followed by second-hand Courtiers in
second-hand Court dresses, and other
seedy finery. It does not say much
for the cause of º in Australia
that there should be a large demand
for the left-off liveries of our Courtiers,
who are offered the “best price” for their trappings, by the MEssrs.

To get divorced from an espousal of the latter nature, it is decidedly

A. TALE OF THE DOG DAYS.
“It is not perhaps generally
known "–as the 5...".
liners say, when they are
about to furnish a shi ing's
worth of the very stalest
news—that there exists in
London a regular body of
professional dog-stealers. The
members of the fraternity are
understood to keep a Secre-
tary to conduct their corres-
pondence, as well as a large
tanning establishment, to pre-
pare for the leather market
the hides of such animals as
are not ransomed by their
owners. The dog stealers
recently took a savage way
to work on the fears of an
old lady whose pet had fallen
into the hands of “the trade,”
and who had shown some
reluctance to lay down the sum of eight pounds, which had been
demanded as the price for the restoration of the favourite.
. The owner of the delicate animal received one morning by post the
tips of her dog's ears, with an intimation that the entire animal would
be forwarded to her by post in the same minute instalments unless the
money was forthcoming, and that on the next day the parties who sent
the letter proposed to drink each other's health in a cup of dog's nose.
Rather than submit to the infliction of these homoeopathic doses of
º composed of infinitesimal morsels of her lost favourite, the
lady at once sent the sum demanded, and received her dog, minus the
tips of his ears on the day following.
A BROADSIDE FROM THE BLACK SEA.
I. THE EMBARKATION.
WE know what hopes went with them, from either side the sea—
The flower of France and England—our Western chivalry—
Into their hands we gave our strength—believing that the trust
Was destined soon to be redeemed—with sword and bayonet thrust.
They sailed—our prayers rose after them—a fair wind sped them on;
Day by day we looked for tidings of battles fought and won;
We heard of halts-of landings—of camps—reviews—and a
Save only news of battle, till our high hopes 'gan to fall—
And we murmured—and they murmured—for they across the foam,
Knew well what was expected by the good folks here at home;
And under summer canvass high hearts did fret and fume,
Till defiance grew disquiet, and glee gave place to gloom.
And all the more for that while they lay idle by the shore,
The Turk all singlehanded plucked the laurels of the war;
And Silistria's bloody leaguer, on earth-work and in foss,
Slovº conquering Crescent gleaming, where we looked to see
e Uross.
At last came news of battle—but not of man with man;
The Plague it was the enemy—that smote them rear and van;
Who can resist the Pestilence that rides upon the airf
And chooseth, at its will, whom to smite and whom to spare *
Death was busy in the daytime, was busy through the dark;
They that lay down hale and healthy, by the dawn were stiff and stark,
A.'France and England in dismay looked on and could not save;
And glory brought no laurels to deck the soldiers’ grave.
Like a grim, gaunt lion in his lair by sickness stricken low,
That feels his strength pass from him—and his leaping blood wax slow,
So lay the French and #. on Aladyn’s green plain, -
While the fierce sun blazed above their heads—and rose and set again.
When sudden came the trumpet-call, and straightway like a charm,
Dull eyes grew bright, and strength was put in many a nerveless arm;
And life chased death from out the camp—and streaming to the shore,
The French and English legions stood to their arms once more.
Six hundred transports floated to bear them to the foe—
And the great ships, round about them, their iron teeth did show.
Sorrow and sickness were flung off, as a serpent casts his skin,_-
There are sixty thousand soldiers—and Sebastopol to win!
IL THE LANDING.
'Neath the lee of Serpent's Island, they have mustered one and all—
Ships of the line and frigates and steamers great and small:
Near twice three hundred transports at their moorings fall and rise—
With sixty thousand gallant hearts—a-fire for high emprise.
The fly out !—a rending shout!—and lo, upon its way,
That mighty mass is moving o'er Kalamita's bay.
As on they pass, both eye and glass are sweeping all the coast—
But all is still, on steppe and hill: where is the Russian host 2
Shoal-water now—from every bow hark to the cable's clank!
Down from the davits swing the boats—still filling—rank on rank.
Then from each hull with even pull, three yards 'twixt oar and oar,
Silent and strong they surge along, till the stems grate on the shore.
And still they land—along the strand close forming as they come,
Close § * strife: ne'er a scream of fife: ne'er a roll of the throb-
lng
rum.
On shore or height no foe in sight! Behind his walls he cowers.
Now forward–France and England—and Sebastopol is ours!
THE NEW POLICE IN PARIs.
... As our French neighbours intend introducing the new police in Paris,
it will be desirable that we should supply a translation of a few of those
terms to which, the institution has given rise in this country. Of
course there will be a new vocabulary daily growing up in Paris, just as
there has grown up in London a complete dictionary of words which
were never dreamed of in any other philosophy but that of the boys and
blackguards—too often synonymous—of our great metropolis. We
have only to suggest, however, a few words by way of commencement
to those young beginners in the art of slang, who may be expected to
“chaff” the Parisian policeman in the execution of his duty. That
they will be called “Bobbies” is perhaps not unreasonable to expect,
and the word “Robert” being the same in English and in French, the
sobriquet is very likely to be adopted. The playfully disposed gamin
will perhaps salute the ears of the new Paris policeman with the words
“Oh / Robert, toi qui j'aime!” which will be equivalent to the cry from
our own native street urchin, of “Oh, Bobby don’t I love you !”
Some may apply to the new French constable the powerfuſ term
Ecraseur as an equivalent to our rather expressive “crusher,” and the
still stronger word Ecorceur may correspond to the denomination of
Peeler, with which our street juveniles favour the ambulant preserver of
public order. We congratulate our neighbours on this new institution,
which could not have had a more a º: founder than the present
Emperor, who was a special . e in London in 1848, and has had
the duties as well as the staff of a policeman at his fingers' ends, and
has been ready to perform his appointed task, whether in capturing a
burglar or taking charge of an old woman for being “drunk and
incapable.”
COPIOUS BLEEDING.
Ast week (according to an Irish contem-
rary) a CAPTAIN HELshAM, of Kil-
enny, wrote a letter of sympathy, to
CoLoREL GARRETT, wherein he makes
the following declaration:—
“As a descendant of those who fought and fell
in olden times at Cressy and Fontenoy, and whose
family blood saturated the plains of Waterloo
and India, had I a son who would follow in the
footsteps of his ancestors, I don't know any
regiment in IHER MAJESTY's service I would
more willingly confide the care of that child to,
than I would to you and the officers under your
command.”
How very numerous as well as ancient
must have been the HELSHAMs to have
saturated not only the plain of Waterloo, but also the plains of Indi
with the contents of their arteries and veins ! What oceans of bloo
must they have shed for their country, to impregnate all those
extensive tracts of land with so much of that fluid that no more of it
could be received or imbibed! Surely the exploits of CAPTAIN HEL-
sHAM’s ancestors will never be forgotten, even by his friend, CAPTAIN
GARRETT, and the officers of the oblivious 46th.
I)ifference between Two Suits.
TheRE is this difference between a Law- and a Love-Suit—that with
a Law-Suit our fears are generally for the worst, whereas with a Love-
Suit our hopes are always for the best.

HE IRON AGE OF THEATRICALS.
=== -,ſºſ E
see that an Iron Theatre
is about to be exported to
Australia. We suppose
the appointments that
accompany the building
will be of acorresponding
texture, and that the
actors—or at least the
principal tragedian—will
be a gentleman with iron
lungs, adapted to a hard
style of acting. We
would suggest that on
the opening night the
... company should sing All'
idea di quel metallo in addition to the National Anthem. The freight
of the Tſ. will, it is said, be very expensive; and if the company
and the pieces are exported with it, the cost will be ruinous; for
supposing the dramas to be estimated as dead weight they would be
sufficient to sink the ship, while the actors, if taken as measurement
goods, must be estimated at the very highest figure if they are allowed
to rate their magnitude by their own standard.
PROGRESS OF WOMAN.
THE softness of the softer sex is sometimes excessive, not only in
respect of heart and head, but also of general bodily constitution. The
skin is so soft that it is affected by . impression; the chest, the
digestive apparatus, are equally susceptible, and this feeble and sickly
condition of system is termed, in genteel slang, “delicate.” Delicacy
in ideas, delicacy in complexion, delicacy in thought, word, and action,
constitute the charm of woman; but there is nothing charming in a
weak stomach, and a tendency to catarrh, and a disposition to faint on
the least exertion. Infirmities like these can never render her an
object of interest to any rational man but a medical one. We turn
with pity and distaste from the poor creature afflicted with them to the
contemplation of such a feminine phenomenon as that of which an idea
is suggested by the following paragraph from the Bristol Mirror:-
“FEMALE PEDEstatanism.—MRs. DUNNE, the Bloomer Pedestrian, accomplished her
task of walking 1,000 half-miles, in 1,000 successive half-hours, on Saturday morning;
and so little distressed was she by the feat that she immediately commenced another
i. ºf walking 150 quarter-miles in 150 quarter-hours, which she completed in due
ine.
We do not mean to say that we should like the practice of walking
for wagers to become fashionable amongst ladies; if they are to be
Pets and Wonders, let them be such in virtue of their endearing and
admirable qualities, and not by getting over so much ground in a stated
time, and picking up a given number of pebbles with their mouths;
which were not made for that purpose. The better half of humanity
was meant for other matches than pedestrian. But neither is it desirable
that all men should be athletic performers. Both in one sex and the
other, however, a few professors of nimbleness, and muscular agility,
are useful. They set an example to, and exert a wholesome influence
on the rest. We don’t want the wives and daughters of England to
do pedestrian feats and to wear pantaloons. But MRs. DUNNE teaches
them one fact; namely, that a woman can walk. This is denied by
some, and with a show of reason.
Women do not in #. walk; only amble along, or pace to and fro,
with the sort of crawl called “promenade.” Whatever may be the quali-
ties of the female heart, that organ cannot possess the power to carry, on
the circulation properly, if its proprietress takes no more exercise than
this. Hence the need of nurses, doctors, medicines, and changes of air
without end, entailing embarrassment, distraction, and often ruin; at
any rate causing the expenditure, to avert misery, of money that might
have served to purchase pure enjoyment. In any case, an ailing wife is
a torment to herself and her husband, and the greater torment to him
the more he cares for her. Sighings, yawnings, moans, and groans, to
say nothing of fits, are the accompaniments of indisposition; accom-
animents not melodious, nor tending to increase domestic harmony.
Then, how much more a husband might enjoy of his wife's society, if
she had the adequate use of her º Why should man be doomed to
take his constitutional alone P Why must every family excursion cost
poor Paterfamilias more than it is worth by eversomuch, that would
perhaps have bought new dresses ..º.º. most womankind
can go nowhere without being conveyed. MRs. DUNNE shows her sex
what they might do; and without going her lengths as regards exercise,
or her brevities as regards dress, they might so far take an example
from the active Bloomer, as to derive a great accession of brilliancy, as
well as increase of duration to their own bloom.
REPUBLICANISM.–A “Sovereign” contempt.
AGRICULTURAL REWELS.
THE Northampton Herald reports, that at the late meeting of the
Northamptonshire Agricultural Association, MR, STAFFORD In pro-
posing the health of “The Agricultural Labourers of England,” made
the following candid remarks:—
“The labourer asked as much for his labour as he could get for it, and the employer
engaged that labour for as small a sum as he could. That was a hard bargain
in which there was no question of feeling cherished, but simply a transaction of com-
merce and barter; but undeterred by that severe bargain, the agriculturists still
drank to the prosperity of the agricultural labourer.”
According to the journal just quoted, the toast was received with
loud cheers; the reporter, however, does not state that it was succeeded
by a song, with the appropriate title of
D R i NK T H E L A B O U R ER!
I)rink the labourer; drink the swain,
Through whose toil we reap our grain,
Rear our oxen, sheep, and swine, .
By whose means we’ve got this wine.
Drink him; and observe that he
Should be drunk with three times three,
Of the labourer's hire a sign,
Meaning weekly shillings nine.
Drink him; in a sense ’tis true
That we absolutely do;
That, whereby we cut him short,
Forms a portion of our port.
Claret too, champagne, and hock;
Drink the fellow in the smock!
Trink him; nay you must do so
If you drink his ſealth or no.
Fill your glasses to the brim
Like your garners, filled by him.
Train your bumpers, every sup,
As you use the bumpkin up.
HDrink him, farmers, in your wealth,
Shall we say we drink his health?
Yes; for toil and scanty fare
Do the labourer's health impair.
Drink his health; but, as we do,
Let him drink his own health too,
Health, imbibed with wholesome beer,
Lest we drink it all out here.

IN AMERICA. HAS AN ENGLISHMAN PROPERTY
IN HIS OWN NOSE P
- - OST certainly not. There can be no
- - doubt that, analogically reasoned
upon the principles laid down by
Citizen CAREy, the great trans-
atlantic political economist, an
Englishman's nose in the States, is
in no manner a man’s property. In
a word, a British nose in America
is outside of all ownership.
Citizen CAREY is a man doubt-
less held in most deserving honour,
by his fellow-citizens. This fact
of course implies that he is smart
as gifted. He has plainly a great
genius for annexation. The magpie
t, even as the secretive genius of º
might be Citizen CAREY’s cres
bird seems to guide his quill. Weak, conscientious citizens have been
moved by doubts of the honesty and fair-dealing shown to British
authors by American booksellers who, without the outlay of a dollar,
have annexed the author's works. Take good heart, ye timid ones,
and rob at peace; authors have no rights. Citizen CAREY has proved
the hollowness, the emptiness of the author's pretension, playing upon
it like any drum. In fact the author has no claim to his book, because
he never had any property in it; he has * worked up common
stock. Take the parallel case of a silk-worm. The worm, to be sure,
produces silk; but by what means? The worm must first consume
the green leaf. “Patience,” says the Eastern apothegm, “and the
mulberry leaf becometh satin.” Now, what is your author but a mere
worm, who feeds his brain upon the common things around him
—human hearts and human doings, and such matters, in which there is
no property whatever—and being fed his fill, sets himself to work and
spins out his book? If a man could write a book in the exhausted
receiver of an air-pump, he might have some small claim to a portion
of the work; but writing with the view and enjoyment of all the world
about him, he takes from everything, and so taking acquiresno property.
For instance, when TAsso–for want of the midnight taper—wrote his
verses by the light of his cat’s eyes, we should like to know—and
perhaps Citizen CAREY will some day benevolently resolve the question
—how much of the verse was due to the cat, and how much to TAsso's
own Muse?
“The man who makes a book,” writes Citizen CAREY, “uses the
common property of mankind, and all he furnishes is the workmanship.
Society permits him to use its property, but it is on condition that after
a certain time, the whole shall become a part of the common stock.”
What is the Iliad but a certain apposition of all the letters of the
tº: and Greek cowherds had as much right to the alphabet as
oMER, even after HomeR's use of it. The thing is plain as A B C.
SLR WALTER Scott had no property in his novels; because he had
only filled his mind with facts preserved. He had eaten mulberry leaves,
and it was his business to produce silk | “So again with MR. DickeNs.
Read his Bleak House, and you will find that he has been a most careful
observer of men and things, and has merely been enabled to collect a
great number of facts that he has dressed up in different forms; but
that is all he has done.” Dirit CAREY! The Court of Chancery over-
rules the printed Chancery suit. The book is not allowed by the Great
Seal. A man may have divinest brains in his head, but if they deal
- * legal horsehair, the wig is the original claimant of all accruing
rights.
A stockbroker, guilelessly labouring on 'Change, does not meekly
make a huge fortune by the intelligence and capacities of men, and the
Common pulsation of the electric wires; therefore, when BARABBAs
lays Qut his half million or so on the fattest slice of a county, that slice
remains to him and his heirs for ever; never, never becoming “a part
of the common stock.”
But it is logically otherwise with authors. There was a common
stock of jealousy in the world before the birth of SHAksPEARE. What
§. then, has he in Othello & Men and women died for love
from the beginning. What property, then, in Romeo and Juliet 2
Can MILTON have any copyright in Sin and Death?
The Covenanters were known before the Scotch novels. And even
before the days of Fagan, were there not American booksellers?
MR. CAREY has convinced us; but he strengthens his argument
against the British author by the fact that he is held and treated as a
ragamuffin and a pauper by his own beloved England. Thus, if
England permits the author to go naked, for such nude reason
** may take his skin. If England strips, surely America may
y :
The weight of MR. CAREY’s name will, doubtless, for a time keep
own all agitation of international copyright. . At the same time that a
British subject has no property in his own book, neither has he an
property soever in his nose. For how has his nose been nurture
and renewed: It is proved that by gradual waste and gradual renewal
a man gets an entirely new nose every seven years. And how does he
get it , Why from the common stock of elementary matter lying
around him. His nose is not his private nose, but a nose gradually
built up by the common influences incessantly at work. And, re-
flecting on the masterly logic of Citizen CAREy, we are finally com-
forted with this conviction, that an American bookseller has every
right to take to himself an English author's book, -with this supple-
mentary privilege; a further moral and physical right, should the
author complain of the theft, there and then, and without the least
mercy or remorse, to pull the author's nose.
A WITLER'S QUESTION.
THE great, question now agitating many bars—convulsing º
parlours—and all but confounding many tap-rooms, is this. It is well
known to civilized Europe, that, for the last month, the gigantic, many-
sided author of The Great Taptubopolis has been taking his yearly
wanderings. He was last seen—his shadow flung upon the moonlight
—ascending with his carpet-bag the side of Mount Ararat; and it is
said has possessed himself of the fossil remains of a monkey, with a
collar marked N. O. A., with the very imperfect remains of an H. as
detected through speculative, spectacles. Our author may be hourly
expected at the Mermaid-and-Cork-Jacket. There was a thrill of hope
that he might arrive on Sunday, between the hours of two and five,
when the great question-still throbbing in withers’ bosoms—was,
is he, the author of The Great Taptubopolis, even with a carpet-bag in
his hand, and perspiring from Ararat, is even he to be considered a
traveller? ith the strong sense of impartiality that has ever ani-
mated the feelings and works of our author, it is believed that he will
not hesitate to decide against himself in the negative.
A DRY SUBJECT.
We were sorry to see a paragraph in the Morning Herald, stating
that a stoppage had occurred in many of the canals throughout the
country, partly from the growth of an obstructive water weed; partly
from a deficiency in the supply of water. We trust some means will be
found for removing the weed; but the only remedy for the deficient
water-supply that we see, is at present in nubiºus. Should it descend
from the clouds in copious rain, the showers will have to be very heavy
to afford the needful quantity of water, whereof the decrease has been
doubtless occasioned by the spread of teetotal principles, which, if they
go on extending, will ultimately occasion every well to be exhausted,
º every river in the country (except the nasty Thames) to be drunk
The Outraged 46th.
MAJOR BoMBSHELL (for he enclosed his card) has written to the
Morning Herald awakening indignant attention to the abuse of the
Times of the 46th. Why is there not a Court-martial * Why should
not Printing-House Square be given up to the outraged, gallant fellows,
who would make the scribblers of the Times swallow their own enve-
momed iron quills, and wash down those hireling stilettos with their
own leprous ink?
MRs. GAMP, however, does not advise strong measures; but rather
counsels MAJOR BoMBsh ELL to raise himself above the slander; to
which effect, she has kindly offered the Major the loan of her pattens.
The Military Harvest.
It will be a late autumnal harvest this year. However, wait awhile–
when the harvest is gathered in, you will see that the crops will be
most abundant. Glory does not shoot in a day—especially when it
has walls like Sebastopol to shoot against.

“The officers are treated well, but the English have much to learn.
They lack reverence. They do not understand that an officer is a being
incalculably superior to the private soldier, inasmuch as he is nearer
our Father the Emperor, and reflects his radiance. When we bow
with abject humility, I see they pity us... And in their own army I find
that there is strange condescension. When a common soldier salutes
his officer, the salute is returned. There are other singular things.
Some officers of England have newly been tried by court-martial.
English civilians have presumed to be offended at the verdict, and have
publicly sent large sums of money to a young officer, because they
º him wronged. Such insolent interference with one's superiors
is unknown in our happy land. The knout would be the fitting reward
of it, were it seen. º, master is a rich merchant, and his house is

“One thing, O TecKLA. at Ivan Golow NIN, valet to thy master,
is a thief and a rascal. He is utterly unworthy of thee. I hope that
thoudost givehim no encouragement. Ibeat him on the evening we came
away, that he might remember thouwert mine, but the beast is of a
revengeful nature, and might pay court to thee out of malice. If Ivan
dares do this, TecKLA, I command thee, by my authority, to thrust
into his face the red-hot iron of the tea-urn, and if he complains, tell
the steward to go to the Jew, REUBEN Ashkoff, and demand where are
the silver backs of certain hair brushes, of thy master's. Ivan will
trouble thee no more after the steward brings back the answer. Be

which bears its name. . The stoves here are of a foolish and barbarous
construction, and nearly all the heat goes up the chimney, instead of
warming the chamber. The English are very bigoted about some of their

Sept. #3, 1854.
From the Journal of St. Petersburg.
“We have been favoured by M. RAcKAMoFF, an eminent merchant
of this capital, with the sight of a letter written by a private soldier to
a young female serf belonging to MADAME RAcKAMóFF. The soldier
is a prisoner to the English savages. His letter, which is written with
true military naïveté, affords irrefragable evidence of the brutality with
which these ferocious islanders treat the handful of gallant men who
have fallen into their hands. . They force upon the unfortunate soldier
food of an utterly different character from that to which he has been
aceustomed, and insist on his washing it down with the most wretched
and debasing liquors. The poor fellows are made spectacles to the
population, who fling them cheese and apples, as if they were animals
in a cage, and this poor ALExis, who seems a modest and virtuous, as
well as spirited and loyal young fellow, especially complains that the
English women, who have no delicacy whatever, stare him out of
countenance, and mock his misery by invitations to him to dance. The
treatment of the officers is still more disgraceful. We happen to know
that they are allowed but two roubles a day (except when married,
and then three are given) to provide themselves, with, everything.
man and his wife are expected to live on twelve ‘shillings’, a day!
True, he would have but three in Russia, but then he would enjoy
all those indirect but not unprofitable means of improving his income,
which the paternal indulgence of the EMPEROR allows to all discreet
officials. ut this barbarous meanness is not the worst. . In the
hopes of saving even the paltry cost of maintaining these victims of
treachery, the English are about to take them out to a sand, upon
which, in other days, British KING CHARLEs caused two thousand Jews
to be exposed and drowned, in the hope that a similar fate may over-
take these unhappy Russians. We are authorized to state, that if this
be done, their deaths shall be terribly avenged at the approaching
capture of the dastardly Baltic squadron.”
Financial Logic.
The Times City article commenced the other day with the statement
following:—
“The English funds have again been without the slightest animation to-day."
It follows that the fundholders for the time being were proprietors
of dead stock. -
England and France Afloat.

THE SIDEREAL DIRECTORY OF THE BRITISH
ASSOCIATION.
verybody knows that the Council of
the British Association, have long
been actively engaged in the pre-
paration of a Sidereal Directory,
and that they have managed to
obtain the addresses of upwards of
8,000 stars.
It is ºbvious, that could implicit
reliance be placed on such addresses
the British Association would
have much better reasons, than
VIRGIL ever possessed, for saying
sie ifur ad astra. The last report
from the Council, however, compels
- - - us to conclude that no such cer-
tainty has been attained, for it states-
“Many of the Northern circumpolar stars have been observed at Oxford, and their
positions have been fixed accordingly.”
A manifest allusion to the gathering of contributors to Blackwood’s
Magazine, which took place at Oxford about a year ago. Now we all
know that those circumpolar stars went bock again immediately after
they had taken their degrees, and it is absurd to suppose that their
positions could in any way be fixed or determined by what took º
on that memorable occasion. Penetrated with this truth the B. A.
have determined to do their work anew, and have resolved to issue a
circular to each star, calling upon him to furnish all the necessary
information respecting himself under the following heads:—
Name and Titles in any Scientific or Learned Bodies.—Under this
head each star will have the goodness to state the name by
which he is known in his own sphere, and also his Arabian or
Roman names. If he should not have been known to the
Arabians or Romans the B.A. will require very precise expla-
nations from him before this claim to be º as a star can
be admitted.
Address—Here must be stated the star's right ascension at the time
of his filling up the circular, and, to ensure uniformity, it is par-
Hºly requested that all the stars will observe Greenwich
line.
Qualifications—Under this head the star's magnitude must be
stated. If a shooting star, his game license must be exhibited.
Here, too, he may say if he be of a malignant or of a benign
aspect, if he be a “bright particular star,” if he be in the habit
of “still quiring to the young-eyed cherubim.”
Medical or Surgical Offices held by him.—The information to be given
under this head is principally required by ZADKIEL, who has
undertaken to bear part of the expense of postage for the B.A.
Under this head the star must state whether, when he is above
the horizon, PROFEssoR EISENBERG may once more extract a
corn from my LoRD STUART, DE DEcſes foot by a painless
operation, and if, when he is in apogee, it will be better for
r. Punch | whose hairs, old friend, now, thinly grow") to pur-
chase one of the inimitable Dicks's toupées, or to make himself
a savoury mouthful for a Cossack by a copious use of PROFEsson.
BRowN’s Oleum jecoris camelopardalis.
Honorary Appointments held by him.—Here the star-will state over
the concerns of what mortal he is supposed to preside—that
presidency being a purely honorary appointment, and productive
of no advantage to the star. The # A. give notice, however,
that it is an act of treason against common sense for any star to
say that he has taken the concerns of NICHOLAs Romanoff
under his charge.
As it is to be feared that stars of malignant aspect will, from the very
malignancy of their nature, endeavour to conceal their real dispositions,
every star is earnestly requested to give all the information in his
power, concerning his neighbours, and the natives of the galaxy are
desired not to let the milk of human kindness, in which they so abound,
prevent them from stating the truth boldly.
In the case of a double star, or of the nebulae, the circular need only
be filled º: one of the firm, and it is hardly necessary to state that
if the leading star (Orion for instance) be from home, Alpha Orionis.

SEA-SIDE HAT-A HINT TO MATERFAMILIAS.
FRAGRANCE WISIBLE.
A. scIENTIFIC, correspondent of the Times,
signing himself “INvestigator,” declares that ||
he can, with a great approach to truth, assert -
“That a bad smell may be mapped, i.e., the organic atoms ||
in it laid down on paper, so as to show their very outline.”
This assertion, “Investigator” illustrates by
an experiment, in which, by the use of the
. immense numbers of fungi and [.
animalcules, existing in the exhalation of a
cesspool, were found to mark it with charac-
teristic forms. The further progress of dis-
covery will no doubt show that every odour
has its shape; and we shall be able to dis-
tinguish the perfume of a dead well from that
of a pig-sty, by looking at it through a magnify-
ing glass. It is to be apprehended that the
celebrated dispute between the eyes and the
nose in regard to the spectacles, will be revived,
with a complication derived from the fact that
glasses are now made use of by the former to
make researches in the province of the latter.
Perhaps optical instruments will in time be con-
structed of such power as to enable us to see
a hasty smell at a distance, and give it a wide
berth or get out of its way.
The Reign of War in Russia.
It has been stated by the newspapers that the
Amphion and Archer have captured twenty
Russian barges laden with corn and rags.
Especially, we should think, with rags. Should
the reign of Nicholas last much longer, the
Russiaus will have nothing but rags to export—
and little else to wear.

The Empire is–Police!
Louis NAPOLEoN has resolved to introduce our English system of
New Police into Paris. Several distinguished members of our force
have been dispatched from Scotland Yard to instruct the French
policemen in their duties. . It is not true however, as reported, that
they have been accompanied either by cooks or nursery-maids.
Extremes.—Many a fool has passed for a clever man, because he
has known how to hold his tongue; and many a clever man has passed
for a fool because he has not known how to make use of it.

ROYAL AND IMPERIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS,
UNCH has often thought that the varieties of
human life are scarcely more wondrous than
the various ways of getting a living. There
used to be a man about town who got a daily
meal by literally whistling for a dinner, and who
in pursuit of a diurnal blow-out, eventually blew
out the brief bellows of his own vapid existence.
He flourished for a time on the wind which he
was enabled to raise, but his flatulency became
at length flat and stale, until it ended in being
utterly unprofitable. Some men live by hang-
ing out from the car of a balloon, where they
are so tied by the leg as to § every one who
sees them in a state of frightful suspense; and
there was a poor fellow who lived—and died—
by descending in a º until the aim of
his life proved to be literally the end of his
existence. - -
One of the last new expedients for putting
bread into one's mouth, is the recently dis-
covered art of walking with the head down-
wards. Two or three headstrong individuals
have adopted this new walk of life, and among
them is a certain Signor, who declares that
his Antipodean exploit has been commande
by the K. of PRussia and the EMPEROR
the presence of Royalty can scarcely be said
to know whether they stand on their head or
their heels, and there are many persons who to
win the favour of an Emperor, would lower the
head to an extent that would degrade it even below the level which
the heels would naturally occupy. Of course if the Signor asserts
that he has been commanded by foreign potentates to walk with his
ead downwards, we are bound to believe him, but we do not think
that either the KING or PRussia, or the EMPEROR NAPOLEoN would
have desired any but one of their own subjects to stoop the head
to the extent that is shown in the topsy-turvy proceeding to which
we have alluded. . Such a proceeding must compel the executant to
look at the world in an upside-down point of view, and teach him to
look up to everything low, and down on what is elevated. Such a
feat may suit, the humour of absolute monarchs, but we are not sur-
prised that the trick—if such it may be called—has not become very
popular with the British public.
POETRY OF PARISH CLERKS.
A QUESTION has arisen as to what hymn books shall be used in
churches. Those at present in use are felt to be objectionable on .
accounts, one of which, of some importance, is that the verses whic
they contain are about the worst in the language. Hymns are deYo-
tional songs, and songs are poems; but the lines in question are quite
destitute of poetry. Most of them consist of mere tumid prose put
into rhyme; and what can be more repulsive than doggrel applied to
the expression of solemn ideas? There are certain compositions of the
sort required—the work of a Royal, Hebrew bard–one might think
that they would serve till better could be had, without the alterations

acred songs are surely the only fit songs to be sung in churches; and
at least none should be tolerated that have not ordinary poe

OUR RUSSIAN PRISONERS.
..THESE people increase upon our hands. A day or two since, a poor
little baby war prisoner was born at Chatham; but, as we understand
that the EARL OF ABERDEEN immediately telegraphed his intentions of
becoming godfather to the infant Muscovite, the little stranger will
doubtless be provided for. Still, the question remains to be answered,
what is to be done with our Russian prisoners? Are they to be kept
in idleness? The magnanimity of Nicholas stops the pay of his
sailors and soldiers when made captive: they have then his imperial
and paternal permission to starve; but, of course, John BULL takes
humane care that the Muscovite belly shalf be filed, and that, doubtless
to the said belly's astonishment, with good beef and wheaten flour.

Nevertheless, we ought to have some return for our outlay on such

all that we ask is, that the Russian irº. should be put to some sort

fitness, a significance in, such a tribute that should have, at once, a
moral and ſistorical value. We propose, then, that the Russian
prisoners be placed at the benevolent disposal of MR. MITCHELL,
Secretary of the Zoological Gardens; and that, under his direction,
they shall by easy task-work construct, anew a den for the Russian
bear at the Gardens, aforesaid; the bear's abiding-place being wholly
constructed of the timbers of a prize Russian ship; and the bars forged
from the iron of Russian cannon and Russian anchors.
A den, constructed of such materials and by such hands, would
surely enshrine a continual lesson and a continual moral. With the
bear—a real Russian bear, and the Gardens rejoice at the present time
in a magnificent specimen of the brute—pacing to and fro, oak-bound
and iron-barred in that den, what would he represent but Nicholas
thrust into confined limits? And the Russian timber and Russian
metal confining the brute, what would they represent but proper
Russian barriers, newly made the Russian confines to Russian ag-
gression ?
LEAD LINES.
MR. PUNCH is so inexperienced in feminine wiles as to have read
with the greatest astonishment an article headed thus:–“Leaden
Combs for Darkening the Hair.”
On the first perusal of these marvellous words he was led irresistibly
to the conclusion that he had accounted for the hitherto mysterious
circumstance that black lead always figured as an important item in
the household accounts of Mrs. Punch. The remainder of the adver-
tisement, however, dispelled this idea. “They are of everlasting
wear,” it stated, and Mr. Punch, knowing black lead to be of a crumb-
ling and perishable nature, straightway abandoned his hypothesis. But
on the supposition that the combs were really composed of the metal
in its commonest form, it became evident that the advertisement had
been drawn up by a person altogether ignorant of orthography, and
that it should have run thus—“They are of everlasting ware,” or
rather “ of everlasting hardware.”
That the combs must answer the end for which they were constructed
was evident to him when he considered that the checelures which are
tical secured by them can never be called light hair; whilst that they must
operate beneficially on the wearer's might, to a certain extent, be in-
ferred from the fact that those who wear them can never be light
headed.
Punch would º “bear a hand to help a female in distress,” and
he º to suggest that as these leaden combs cannot conveniently be
worn during the hours of repose, it may be as well that, ladies, whose
tresses are what Punch is and always will be-universally red—should
in lieu of the ordinary curl papers employ the lead with which the Chinese
merchants line their tea chests. Then Pºiº the salutary operation
of a cup of bohea on the pineal gland of Matilda or Anna Maria would
be considerably enhanced by the reflection that the wrapper which

THE SANITARY TO-MORROW.
THE decline of the lately prevailing epidemic will no doubt allay those
gloomy, or at least uncomfortable, apprehensions, which, during the
eriod of its destructive existence, must have oppressed Boards of
łuardians, and Parochial and Municipal authorities in general. The
temperature is declining; and it may be hoped that the return of the
pestilence may be postponed for several, perhaps as many as nine or ten
months. The immediate necessity of making drains, repairing or
covering in sewers, and executing suchlike sanitary works, may be con-
sidered to have abated, which will probably more than counterbalance
the less gratifying consideration that the ensuing season is the proper
time for abating nuisances. Ratepayers will naturally feel that it will
be time enough for that another day, and of course will not believe
that day to have come until it shall have passed, and the epidemic shall
have become prevalent once more.

THE Emperor attacked the Russian general, SKRAMM, in the defiles

A DYING BLACK SWAN IN THE CHURCH.
AMONG the literary advertisements of the day we have noticed the
following:—
Just published, in Post 8vo, Price 5s.
DEATHEED CANTICLES. By a Dying Clergyman of the Church
of England. - -
We are obliged to put up with a good deal sometimes in the way of
nausea, but we must say there is rather too strong a savour of cant in
he idea of these death-bed canticles. A canticle is literally a little
sopg, and if the clergyman is really dying we think it is rather too bad
of anybody to speculate in a publication of his death-bed ditties. At
all events we think the publication should be postponed until the fate |
of the author is known, when the work might either be advertised as
the productions of a dead or a convalescent person, but there is some-
thing awful in issuing from “the Row” the musings of a moribund
minister. If the reverend gentleman has life his friends ought to have
hope, and it is really enough to finish him off at once to announce him
... as a dying singer of death-bed canticles. If the work is
ublished by his own authority, he may have assumed the title of a
“dying clergyman” from a melancholy and morbid feeling that ought
not to be encouraged, but if he is really too ill to attend to the matter
himself, and his friends are preparing his work for the press, it is pre-
maturely passing sentence of death upon the author, to advertise him
as in the act of expiring while his work is in the hands of the printer.
Suppose the reverend individual should get perfectly well, which we
hope he will do, before a second edition is required, it will be absurd
to go on calling him a “dying clergyman.” We cannot wish him better
than that he may survive the sale of the first impression of his book;
for he will in all probability reach an almost fabulous age if he should
live till a reprint is required.
Before and After.
Most French Ministers have in their time been farce-writers. Man
English Ministers have also been known for their farces, but then with
them the Farce has been the result of their having being made Minis-
ters, and not the cause.

plete success, and that your Majesty's enemies are exactly where your Majesty
foresaw and I agreed that they would speedily be.
“Ou inspecting, by the aid of a superb Doi LoND (one of the trophies gained when
your Majesty's soldiers at Odessa so brilliantly cut out the English frigate Tiger)
the manoeuvres of the combined fleets in the bay of Kalamita, it became perfectly
clear to me that the audacious Pº. for which your Majesty gave the aggressors
credit, but of which I confess I scarcely believed them capable, was to be carried
intº effect. In short, I perceived that it was their intention to land upon the soil
of Russia. , I must own to your Majesty that, having made up my mind on this
subject, and having actually beheld hundreds of boats, filled with the ferocious
soldiety of Albion and Gaul, and pulling for the shore, 1 felt so unspeakably dis-
gusted at such a mixture of effrontery and sacrilege, that I was quite unable to witness
the completion ºf the outrage. Nor would I expose my men to the demoralisation
of a spectacle which might have had the effect of rendering them atheists, by showing
them that the God of Russia (I need not name your Majesty) was unable to
protect his own holy land from insult. I therefore withdrew with my whole force,
and left the unprincipled invaders to accomplish their guilt, while I hastened to
prepare the trap devised by your Majesty's prescience.

“I am happy, however, in being able to inform your Majesty that the elements
themselves arose to chastise the aggressors. The most terrible .." began to
descend the instant that the first keel touched the shore, and continued throughout
the whole night, drenching the invaders, especially the English, to the skin. The
mortality in their ranks, occasioned by the deluge of that night, has been enormous.
At least 8000 have been carried off by colds caught upon that occasion, and the
whole of the survivors cough, and roar, and sneeze to such an extent, as to
excite the irrepressible laughter of your Majesty's brave soldiers. . As your Majesty,
in your great leniency, was pleased to order that the war should be carried on wit
humanity, I should have sent a supply of pocket-handkerchiefs to the afflicted
enemy, but for the circumstance of there being but two in our whole army, and these
I thought it well to retain in case we should need them for flags of truce.
“The enemy speedily commenced his advance, and I immediately proceeded to
º: in practice the system º by your Majesty. I steadily retreated before
he allies, until I had lured them as far as the River Alma, the banks of which, I
need not remind your Majesty, are steep and admirably calculated for defence.
Indeed, but, for your Majesty's orders to the contrary, I could have held the
position until the end of the campaign, for it is one from which no general of ordinary
talent, and with a few thousand men, ought to be driven. The enemy commenced
a fierce assault, and was received by your Majesty's soldiers with the calmest valour.
We drove the English back eleven times, and the French twelve, sweeping away
thousands, at every diseharge. About thirty-five of the enemy's generals were
killed, and the lowest estimate at which I can place the carnage in their ranks |
is forty-thousand men. Great numbers of English flags and French eagles were
captured, but in the ardour of the moment your soldiers were too eager to secure
them, and, the Alma happening to be full of water, they have all been washed down
to the sea, or I should of course add them to the thousand similar trophies in
your Majesty's possession.
“May I reckon upon your Majesty's goodness of heart, and your affability
towards the lowest of your subjects, and venture, to record a little jeu de not
which has become a by-word in your army. Nothing in itself, it demonstrates
how cool, and even playful were your troops, while combating for you. The
WOL. XXVII. Q
vaunting IORD RAGLAN came galloping to the front, and
urging on his reluctant troops to battle. , A shot from a
Minié rifle wounded the animal. It rushed away, |.
and speedily dismounted his awkward rider, who fell ead
over heels. “RAGLAN, thou callest thyself,’ said the
gallant fellow who had fired the shot, tranquilly reloading.
‘Methinks thou hast again turned a SoMERset !”
“I have the further honour to inform your Majesty,
that, having inflicted this terrible chastisement, and finding,
to my satisfaction, that the enemy was bent upon his doom,
and continually renewed his charge, I ordered my troops to
indulge him, and to fall back, giving the movement the
semblance of flight. I need not add that I caused them,
by precept and example, to keep so far in advance of the
pursuer as to incur little peril. This system I have con-
tinued up to the present time; and I am happy to inform
your Majesty that I have led the allies a wearisome march
across the Crimea, making a show of resistance, but giving
way when attacked, until I have brought them to Bala-
klava Bay, within a few miles of the spot prepared for
their annihilation. Having seen them here, I have with-
drawn under cover, well assured that they will speedily rush
upon their fate. They are, I rejoice to say, bringing all their
artillery, ships, and stores together; so that the whole
armament will be destroyed at a single effort, and your
Majesty's soldiers be relieved from further toil and exertion.
Sebastopol awaits the invaders. ---
“The loss in your Majesty's ranks has been trifling ; and
none of it is due to the fire or steel of the enemy. In re-
pelling the English from the banks of the Alma, three
privates and a corporal pressed too near to the crumbling
edge, and fell into the waves. ... As they shouted to us not
to mind them, but to beat their Father's (your Majesty's)
foes, we felt obliged to comply, and they were drowned.
This, and the loss of a recruit, who expired with joy at
beholding the gallantry of his comrades, are the only
casualties I have to record.
“In the meantime, I humbly recommend everybody, in-
cluding myself, for stars and orders. Everybody achieved
miracles of viour, and it would be invidious to select any
one for especial mention, unless I make an º: in
my own favour. When the allied army is annihilated, I
shall do myself the honour of letting your Majesty know.
Until then, and always,
“Your Majesty's faithful Servant,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW UNIFORM.
THE LIVES OF THE SHERIFFS.
WE have had the Lives of the Chancellors, and the Lives of other
public functionaries; but the Lives of the Sheriffs, though yet an un-
written book, is a work for which ample materials will be found in
those brilliant biographical bursts which bubble up every Goose-day
from the mouth of the Recorder to the ears of the Cursitor Baron...We
have lately been favoured through this medium with a sketch of the
careers of HENRY MUGGERIDGE, alderman and corn-dealer, and
DECIMUs CRossLEy, sheriff and poulterer. , -
MR. BANKs, the Čursitor Baron, having taken his seat on the bench
in the Court of Exchequer, in his full scarlet robes (Quaere, has he a
scanty set for less important occasions?) commenced listening with
solemn gravity to the life, adventures, and achievements of MR. ALDER-
MAN MUGGERIDGE. That distinguished man is, it seems, “sprung from
that class,” says the Recorder, “with which I have the honour of know.
ing that your lordship has a warm and hereditary sympathy—that class
which, under the name of British yeomen, &c., support their families
through the pleasant and fertile plains of *.
We then learn the important fact, that “he is one of a large family—
one of eight, sons I believe”—an announcement which no doubt im-
ressed the Cursitor Baron, as it will the world, with due admiration
or the multiplicity of the MUGGERIDGEs. “At an early period,” con-
tinues the learned Recorder, “at the age of 13, I understand, he was
inducted into the mysteries of a merchant’s counting-house.” What
these “mysteries” may be, which required the awful ceremony of an
“induction,” we cannot understand, but we know that some of the
first of , our City magnates have been “inducted ” into these
“mysteries” by no more formal process than an en ment as errand
boy. Having “attracted the attention of his fellow citizens in the ward
of Castle Baynard”—though what he did to attract their attention,
except to follow the usual course of canvassing them for their votes,
we are not informed,—he became a Common Councilman. In that
character he hammered away very properly at one of the thousand
abuses of the City. The result of his i. seems, however, to be
almost, if not quite void for remoteness, inasmuch as the Recorder has
no doubt that “the exertions of ALDERMAN MUGGERIDGE will have
laid the foundation of some future arrangement, which, either by the
internal powers, of the Corporation itself, or by the assistance of the
Legislature will be productive of some satisfactory result.”
aving traced his hero to the dignity of an Alderman and Sheriff
the Recorder quits the subject of the MuggeBIDGE Memoirs, an
introduces M.R.CHARLEs DECIMUs CRossLEY, the Sheriff and Poulterer,
determination”
who seems to have º his eggs on the whole to a very fair market”
There is no particular distinction to be claimed for CRossLEY”
except that he “enjoys the Freedom of the §: a pure source
of enjoyment 1–and is “connected with highly respectable families, in
York, with which county,”, adds the Recorder, favouring us with a
delicious little bit of autobiography, for which we cannot be too
grateful, “I MysELF have the honour to be connected.”.
There is not much to be made of MR. CRossLEY's biography, for a
ºl.” life presents but few opportunities for distinction, and the
ecorder therefore looks to the future as the field of future exploits.
The Recorder thus proceeds—
“It is with the greatest confidence I present these gentlemen to your lordship, for
confirmation on the part of the Crown. The past year has been a year of tranq ty
and prosperity in our history. Of that which is to come no one can judge the impor-
tance, but of this I am sure, that the loyalty and determination of the gentlemen I now
present to you will not be found wanting, should any unexpected difficulties arise."
It is certainly a new fact to us that the past year has been one of
tranquillity, for we were under the rather general impression that it
had been a year of war, but if any emergency should arise, if there
should be “unexpected difficulties,” for which, the Government and
the Legislature have failed to provide, there will be the "loyalty and
of MUGGERIDGE, and of CRossLEY, “citizen and
poulterer,” to fall back upon. It is gratifying to feel that the valiant
ºlºr is not likely to prove chicken-hearted, or to display the white
eather.
| After a speech from the Cursitor Baron, in which he augured “im:
mense things” of the shrieval career of MEssRs. MUGGERIDGE and
|CRossLEY, the ceremonies by which the city holds, its lands were
|commenced, and ALDERMAN SALoMons, who º to be the Civic low
comedian proceeded, to go through some “ryghte pleasaunte” foole
in the fashion described in the following paragraph:- -
“MR. ALDERMAN SALoMoss, as the senior alderman present, not having passed the
chair, proceeded to the floor of the court, and created considerable laughter by the
humorous and quaint manner in which he took up the mimic adze and billhook to cut
in twain two small bundles of peeled willows, about six inches in length, supposed to
be two bundles of faggots, and so adroitly was it done with the assistance of the grave
and solemn usher, who looked upon the ceremony as one big with the fate of a great
city, without which a sheriff could not perform his function, that not to have seen the
faggots cut, the horse shoes and hobnails counted, was destruction to all his grandeur
and official usefulness.” [!]
We cannot help admiring the spirit of satire in, which ALDERMAN
SAIoMQNs, converted into a “screaming farce”, the pompous absur-
dities that used to be performed with the most imbecile solemnity.
“ALDERMAN SALoMoxs then proceeded to go through the ceremony of counting six
horseshoes (which, by the by, are stated to have been used for the same purpose during
the last four centuries) and 61 hobnails, and on the announcement of that number,
“The Cursitor Baron declared the number a good number, and that suit and service
had been well done.”
Thus ended a piece of annual º which takes place º:
enough on the great goose festival of England. We cannot help pitying
men of sense, such as the Recorder we are sure is, and the Cursitor
we hope is, who are compelled to go through a series of the most
egregious fooleries that have survived the modern advance of intellect,
We fancy we see in the inflated style of the Recorder a disguised air of
satire which is intended to have the effect of a reductio ad absurdum on
a custom, the breach and ultimate annihilation of which we are all
earnestly looking for.

THE TYRANT'S DOOM.
(By TUMMUs.)
As I was a zittum atop of a gate,
In pace and in quiet my victuals to ate,
There come a young ooman along the road-zide, .
“Now what bist thee arter?” says I, “purty maaid P’’
“Well, if you must know, then, I’ll tell you,” says she,
tº gwyun into town, mun, and that’s what I be.”
“And what, purty maaiden, bist gwyun there vor?”
“Oh! to hear if there's any moor news vrom the War.”
“What consarn is the War unto thee, then?” says I;
“Oh! never you mind,” she so sharp did reply.
“But I wants for to git satisfaction about
The wounded and killed if the listes is out.”
Ah! thee hist afeard 'bout zome chap of thy kin,
That either the vleet, or the vorces is in.”
“No, I han’t got no kinsman among 'em at all,”
And the drops from her eye did begin for to fall.
“Then thee'st got a zweetheart,” says I, “I suppose,
By thy tears tricklun down ...; the zide o'thy nose.”
“There's a young man as went for a soger,” she said,
And I wishes I know'd if he’s livin or dead.”
“Now come, purty maiden,” says I, “leave off cry’n,
There’s mothers, young ooman, and zisters, and wives:
And their zons, brothers, husbands, a lozun their lives.”
“'Tis frightful to think on; 'tis dreadful,” she said,
“Oh, what must there be on that IMPEROR’s head | *
"Well,” says I, “altogether, I s'pose, not much less
Than a million of murders, to gie a round guess.”
There’s hundreds and thousands in a wus case than thine.

For tyrants be reckon'd too big for the 'size,

LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR RUSSIAN GUEST.S.
Poor fellows, whom Nicholas no more commands,
Having laid down your arms, give us also your hands,
We forget you were foes—and in truth you were not,
Any more than the stones that were crushed with our shot.
You were only a Tyrant's unfortunate thralls,
With your bodies for bricks who built ramparts and walls,
Which if we, to hit at him, were forced to strike through,
'Twas with sorrow and pain and compassion for you.
He piled you, like sandbags, or clods of mere dirt,
The blows which we aimed at his power to avert;
He cares not what swarms of his vassals may fall,
Whilst yet he has more to oppose to our ball.
Should a score of his serfs stop a shot or a shell,
That, your monarch considers, will do pretty well
For he thinks his loss less in the slaves that we slay,
Than our own in the missiles which we shoot away.
Come; you’re out of the clutch of your savage old chief,
Here’s some bread for you; here are potatoes and beef.
And to wash it all down here's a jug of good beer;
We'll make you all jolly now we have you here.
May our nations soon cease this sad warfare to wage,
And your Czart have been caught and confined in a cage,
May youthen to your country take back all you’ve gained,
Whilst by war's happy fortune you here were detained.
May you take the plumpudding whereon you have fed,
And the notions that each has had put in his head,
That by you, Holy Russia delivered may be,
You, through being made prisoners, who learned to be free.
We shall make your captivity easy tº bear,
And may our own people as happily fare,
As many as but, may their numbers be few!
Are, or shall be, in like situation with you.
LADIES” HABITS FOR OCTOBER. .
. HERE is a morsel of fatuous delicacy, nicely adapted to the palate of
imbecile, elegance. The description of the fashions for October, in
Le Follet, commences with the following scrap of fiddleſaddle:
* Notwithstanding the unusually long duration of the fine weather with which our
fair patrons have been so highly favoured during their stay at the gay chateaux of
their aristocratic acquaintances, or at the various fashionable watering places, the
chilly mornings and evenings, and the undeniable lengthening of the latter, indicate
but too plainly the approach of that period of the year when in-door amusements must
be made to compensate for out-of-door recreation.”
Le Follet may be done by a man six feet three inches high, with bulk
and brains in proportion. He may have penned the foregoing specimen
of queasy miminypiminyism with a fist like a shoulder of mutton, imme-
º after devouring the greater part of a leg, or swallowing some
ounds of bacon and cabbage, washed down with a quart or two of
ARCLAY and PERKINs's stout. He may be able to knock down an ox
walk a thousand miles in a thousand hours, and fight, with the likelihood
to thrash, any man of his weight—that being fourteen stone.
however, have no other business, whereby to support his huge frame,
and satiate his craving maw, than that of writing stuff to flatter the
vanity of the softer portion of the softer sex. Necessity alone—the
necessity of gorging and swilling—may have compelled him to file a
masculine mind down to this. So no more of him; only let the readers
whom he addresses beware, if they want to look pretty for any while,
how they follow his suggestion with respect to in-door amusement.
Every woman, every fashionable woman, even, has a heart, at least
considered as the organ of circulation; and bloodyessels, on the healthy
|. of which depends the bloom of her face, and which will not play
ealthily without out-of-door exercise. She has also muscles and
ligaments, which have to brace her up, hold her together, and keep her
clean-limbed, but will do nothing of the sort for long unless they are
maintained in proper tension,by the same means. Let her loll about
all day in a close “muggy’ house, instead of exerting herself for a
due time in the fresh air, and she quickly begins to droop and look
unwholesome. Soon her complexion fades, or grows discoloured, her
eatures are puffed or shrunken, her form either wastes or swells, she
gets either haggard and lanky, or round and fat; her figure tumbles all
of a heap; her ankles give out, her feet spread and flatten: her elastic
step becomes a waddle; and her person altogether acquires the style of
a COW.
Brilliant eyes, on the other hand, complexion, to match, features
retaining the chiselled outline, a slim and smart figure, neatly turned
He may,
ankles, finely arched insteps, are the reward of walking or riding out at
a good pace, and for areasonable distance, every practicable day. And
by these means is preserved for many a year a contour, the cut of which
resembles that of the doe or the gazelle.
At no period of the year is any healthy young wºman, ºf whatever
station, º: to exchange out-of-door recreation for in-door amuse-
ment, except when it hails or rains, or snows, or thunders and lightens,
or blows a hurricane. Are there not furs? never mind the expense:
the war with Russia has not made them dearer than the attendance of
a simpering doctor. Arethere not muffs, and boas, and all sorts of
waterproof armour? Young ladies, take the advice of your elders, and
as the old women say, “Get out!”—in all tolerable weather.
As to necessary in loor amusement, mind, it also may be made con-
ducive to beauty, by being rendered in some degree, intellectual.
Intelligence adds considerably to the lustre of the eyes, which, without
it have only the glitter of glassbeads, whilst the best shaped and most
splendidly coloured face which they can be stuck in resembles that of a
waxendummy in a hair-dresser's shop. In order, therefore, to attract
admiration, ladies of fashion would do well to cultivate intelligence, to
some extent, by way ºf in-door amusement. -- - -
Beauty may be called a fading flower; but it is a flower that will
fade very much the sooner for being taken in-doors for the winter, like
a geranium. Even Le Follet must, " - - -
the justice of these observations. It will admit that a lady is not a
mere clothes horse, and will perhaps allow that the figure is more than
the dress, and the face than the bonnet,

A STORM IN A KENSINGTON (SLOP) BASIN.
KENsiNgtoN, our favourite suburb, has lately been the scene of a
series of frightful convulsions, in consequence of an election of what are
called “Improvement Commissioners;” for improvement is a quality of
which Kensington is especially susceptible. The election was carried on
amidst the mingled foam of eloquence and porter; the mouths of the
orators and the heads of the pint-pots were equally frothy. Such was
the excitement of the hour that the stranger, passing casually through
the town was dragged in to vote, and even children were pulled up to
the poll, with a reckless disregard to everything.
When the poll had closed, everybody threatened to break the head of
anybody who dared to add the numbers up; and somebody ran off to
bury the voting lists in the churchyard till somebody else ran to dig
them up again. The chairman’s coat was pulled from his back in a
boisterous game of oranges and lemons, into which both parties, some-
how or other, * to fall, until all fell down together. One man
began to ring the church bells, and another threatened to wring his
nose for doing so. A timid adherent of the blues called out “Police!”
Another threw himself into the arms of PUMELL, the beadle; and a
third ran up the ladder of the fire escape, in a panic which only sub-
sided when the firemanthrashed him down again.
AN ACTRESS IN A RAINY DAY.
THE French papers inform us that the celebrated tragic actress,
MADEMoiselle Georges, is, in consideration of her straitened cir-
cumstances, to enjoy the privilege of taking charge of the sticks and
umbrellas at the Great Paris Exhibition. It seems rather infra dig. on
the part of an eminent tragédienne to º: an office so humble, but it
is humanely felt by the Government that she who has suffered from the
storms of adversity deserves to be sheltered from those storms by as
many umbrellas as the public will place in her hands; while the charge
of a number of sticks is one that an actress who must have seen a great
variety of sticks on the stage will find rather congenial to her old
habits. Though the office, is temporary, it is j. that it may be
made permanent by giving her the custody of the umbrella of Louis
PHILIPPE, which seems at present useless to the Citizen King's family.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A BROADSIDE FROM THE BLACK SEA.
III. THE BATTLE OF THE ALMA.
Fº briskly runs the Alma, cold and green from mountain snow;
leasant shade, along its borders, oak and plane and walnut throw,
Where the Tatar shepherd shelters with his flock from noontide heat,
In a silence only broken by the browsing goat's faint bleat.
From the huts beneath the hill-sides, Tatar women to the brink
§§ come to fill their pitchers, or drive down the cows to drink.
All is calm and peace and plenty. Over all—a form of awe-
Sleeps in light the snow-spread table of the mighty Tschatyr-Dagh.
On the northern bank the copses flush with autumn red and gold:
On the southern bank the margin shows a cliff-line bare and bold.
You may cross the stream in spring-time, nor be wet above the knee,
But when ºne: melts the snow-wreaths, who would ford it stout
IllulSU DC.
On the twentieth of September—they had march'd from early morn—
As our armies near'd the Alma, they were weary men and worn;
But the heaviest tread grew Springy, strength was in the weakesſ hand,
As thº “Halt!—Form” was given—for they knew the Russ at
and.
There, along the southern heights, in entrenchments lay the foe
With his batteries in position—seven-score great guns, levell’d low.
There was little time to count them ere their roar the silence woke—
And the dell has grown a hell—all fire and sulphurous smoke.
Now Zouaves and Tirailleurs!—now Rifles and Chasseurs!—
Scatter wide, finding shelter where you can;
Fire steadily and slow, till the distant foemen know
That every Minié bullet has its man!
See, they crouch, well-filled pouch, firm hand and murderous aim :
Every bush, a puff of smoke: every stone, a jet of flame;
And behind their covering shot, at a steady, swinging trot
Downward pours, to the shores, the Allies van!
Again—again—again—those batteries' iron rain,
And thick, alas! our gallant fellows fall:
For the river it is deep, and the banks they are steep,
And the heights there beyond, are like a wall.
But a lusty British cheer, and a thundering British charge, and the
foremost are already in the flood,
Though the great guns ever roar, down upon them from the shore, and
the water that was green turns to blood |
Through the shallows, in the º o'er the boulders, up the steeps,
British, French and Turk, eager for the work,
Are floundering and clambering and rushing with mad leaps—
On again—on amain—some are left, though many die—
Your powder may be damp, but your bayonets are dry:
Let it come but to the steel, and the Muscovite shalſ feel
With what men he his prowess hath to try !
Hark to those ringing cheers! "Tis the bold Welsh Fusiliers,
Ever foremost where there’s work to be done:—
They’ve won footing on the bank—they are closing rank on rank,
Scores of dying, but of flying never one! -
Now, fiery Celtic blood, to our French allies make good
The credit of the lineage that you share
They have gained the heights' bald crown!—Now they stagger—now
they’re down —
But, hark, another cheer, and the gallant Guards are near !
And with glorious tartans streaming, and Highland bagpipes screaming,
The Black-Watch to the rescue appear ! -
At length the crest is won! Stab the gunner at his gun
E’er to take up new ground the batteries wheel;
On–Britons, Turks and French—o'er redoubt and over trench,
Surge on like a wave of flashing steel !—
Lo, they waver—lo, they shake—lo, their line begins to break,
With the tramp of flying men, flying horses, Earth doth quake.
You have fought a desperate fight, you have crushed a giant might,
And fºur hours ere the setting of the sun,
The triple flags wave high, bullet-rent against the sky,
And the Battle of the Alma hath been won!
IV. WAITING FOR NEWS.
Haste, haste, post-haste—across the waste the sleepless Tatar rides;
The steamboat’s prow the sea doth plough, defying winds and tides;
Qn iron rails the train-sped mails like fiery meteors dash;
Electric fires, along the wires, their thought-quicktidings flash.
But neither Tatar riding, nor steamboat cleaving sea,
Nor engine's race, devouring space, nor lightning fast and free, , .
Can match the speed, wherewifh at need, hope, fear, and love combined,
In their ºns flight, to the scene of fight, will sweep the unresting
In 11101.
-
Almost we curse the skill perverse, that so far having gone,
To conquer space and time efface, haits ere its work is done;
Leaving half-said, what should be read entire, or not at all
Till hope's hot thrill, and fear's cold chill, like ague on us fall.
In stately homes—in lowly rooms—how many hearts Nº.
What pampered wealth, and toiling health, alike their vigil keeping!
Still to one tune, both late and soon, all hearts are set and strung;
In mart and street, where'er men meet, one theme on every tongue!
What stalwart hands are liſted up, what gray heads bowed and bare!
hat lisping tongues of infants are taught to shape a prayerſ
Young hearts that looked to lives of love, are sick with bitter fears,
Old eyes are dim for thought of him that should have stayed their years.
At the Horse-Guards gate, are throngs that wait, till the fateful lists
are showm, - - - -
Hard men—pale women—selfish all—all thinking of their own; , .
While !. too proud, with the common crowd, their joys and griefs
to blend,
Restless, at home, await the doom that hopes or fears shall end.
But those who hide their hearts at home, and those the gates that fill,
Whate'er their hopes—whate'er their fears—are English, English still.
No soul so glad, no soul so sad, but its sorrow and its glee
Will be lessened and be heightened by the news of victory.
Thank God, we still have something of the stout old Sparlan strain ;
What mother but would sooner learn how that her son was slain,
Face to the foe, than he should owe his life to flight or fear?
Better to spare a hero there, than have a coward here.
Then pray and wait—you at the gate, and you, your homes within,
Till the cannon's roar, from sea to shore, wake a victorious din.
Your country laughs with those who laugh, and mourns with those who
mourn; -
And their names that fall, at duty's call, in England's heart are borne!

AMöNG the Foreign Intelligence of a contemporary there lately
appeared the statement following:-
“The CARDINAL VIcAR of Rome has just published an edict, in which, after attribut-
ing the cholera to the sins of the Romans, he directs that the finger of St. PETER, the
arm of St. Roc, the heart of St. CHARLEs, and other relics, shall be exposed to the
adoration of the faithful, in order to avert the wrath of the Almighty.”
Mummy was formerly included in the materia medica, and was
administered as a remedy for various complaints. In all probability it
wrought some cures, by the operation of what is commonly called faith,
and which doubtless, in the patients who were cured by mummy, was
the same condition or quality of mind as the faith of the faithful to
whose adoration the CARDINAL WICAR or Roxie has been recommend-
ing his dried anatomical preparations. His Eminence, however, has
the advantage of the old doctors. Those nasty creatures made their
patients actually swallow their mummy; he only requires that his
should be looked at, which is an improvement on the system of DR.
WHAT's-His-NAME, who advertises a cutaneous disease “cured by
smelling.”

SHORT LEADING CASES.
OUR legal contemporaries give occasional Reports
of what they call Short Leading Cases; and as we
think the idea a good one, we shall adopt it, with
our own improvements... We shall add to the short-
ness—if that can be called an addition which is, in
fact, a curtailment—and we shall show the direction
in which the cases lead, if that can be called a
direction which is most uncertain as to the issue.
ADDING NEW PLEA.
Defendant owed plaintiff twenty pounds on a
dishonoured bill of exchange. Plaintiff seeks pay-
ment, and defendant refuses, on the plea that he has
got no money, and this becomes therefore a leading
case, for it leads the plaintiff several times to the
outer door of defendant’s chambers.
BAIL IN ERRoR.
In this case judgment had been given against A,
when B so far lost his own judgment as to become
bail for A, and thus found himself in error. The
º quality of this case consisted in the fact
of its leading B in pursuit of A, who had run away
to Calais.
JUDGMENT FOR WANT of APPEARANCE.
A was in search of a situation as a footman; but,
place, and judgment went against him for want of
appearance.
INsolveNCY.
In this case, plaintiff, a speculative attorney,
brought a speculative action against defendant,
who succeeded, but being saddled with the costs
of his own defence, which could not be got from the
speculative attorney, was obliged to take the benefit
of the Act, and the case became a leading case by
leading defendant to the Insolvent court.
THE GREAT CRIMINAL.-It is the profound remark
of somebody whose name we are unacquainted with,
that the CzAR has committed a crime, and is losing
the Crimea.
WE KNOWS YER FEELINGS.
OH how shall we comfort our Muscovite Premier—
How shall we solace that good man's grief?
He is certain to hear, by the very next steamer, , .
How soundly we’ve walloped the Petersburg thief ?
If there's comfort in this, let our friend well-intentioned,
Be told that the nation’s completely aware
That NICHOLAs Senior, and Nick above mentioned,
Alone find our victories harder to bear.
THE FAITHLESS SHEPHERD.
Wºpity the condition of the lost sheep whose fate is described in
the following paragraph:—
“Shºrp without A SHEPHERD.—A curious incident (says the South-Eastern Gazette)
took place at High Halden on Sunday week. The Rev. R. ShUTE, rector of Halden,
and a minor canon of St. Paul's, London, having been absent from his clerical duties
four Sabbaths out of the last five, during which time the church-going people have had
to return to their homes without their usual spiritual admonitions, the congregation
assembled on the 17th ult, and proceeded to make the best arrangements in their
power for public worship. The parish churchwarden and the churchwarden of the
absent rector with common consent gave out the old hundredth Psalm, after which the
parish churchwarden read a portion of Scripture, selected from Jeremiah, chap. 23; an
anthem followed, sung by an excellent sacred choir. The assembly being not quite
satisfied with so small a portion of sacred writ, the churchwarden read another portion
of Scripture selected from St, John, chap. 3, succeeded by another anthem from the
choir; and in conclusion 16 verses were read from the oth chapter of St. John. The
churchwarden deemed it expedient to offer praise and thanksgiving for all past
mercies, and likewise an .. against cholera, which is very prevalent in the village
and surrounding neighbourhood.”
However laudable may have been the efforts of the churchwarden
and the congregation to get up a service in the absence of the clergyman,
there is something rather derogatory to the solemnity and sacredness
of public worship in the piece of pious patchwork described in the
foregoing statement. The rector cannot, of course, be in two places
at once, and if he was performing the duties of a minor canon, at
St. Paul's in London, he could not be exercising his ministry at High
Halden. A manifold writer is no rarity, but a manifold preacher, or
indeed a parson with more folds than one, has a difficult, if not an
impossible task to execute.
* THE SLAVE TRADE IN BRISTOL.
WE, beg leave to direct the attention of MRs. Stowe to the
following advertisement from a Bristol newspaper:—
WANTEP to purchase immediately, a powerful COB PONY, not less
than 13 hands high; must be warranted sound and steady in harness. Al-o, a
YOUNG MAN to groom and drive the same, and make himself generally useful.-
Address in either case to R. P., Bristol Mercury Office.
Is this a free country? Shall Britons ever, ever (instead of never,
never), be Slaves? are the questions that ºft. themselves to us
on reading the above paragraph. Here in the heart of England is an
intimation that “a powerful 8. Pony and a Young Man to groom and
drive, the same” are “wanted to PURCHASE.” . There can be no
mistake, for the word “Also,” distinctly connects the Young Man with
the Cob Pony as an article “wanted to purchase,” and if the shadow
of a doubt could still remain on our mind, the ambiguity is dispelled
by the concluding intimation that we are to “address in either case to
R. P., Bristol Mercury Office.” It is evident from this that the Cob
Pony may be purchased without the Young Man, or the Young Man
may be purchased without the Cob Pony.
We cannot write any further on this subject in consequence of our
burning indignation having boiled away all the ink in our pen, and set
our blood dancing in our veins at such a rate that we can no longer
guide our fingers.

completely domesticated, by which the inconvenience above alluded
to is avoided, when transferred to ships. And as live stock is
now so essential for Passenger Ships, J. B. has always on hand at this place, a large

THE "SPECIAL” EMPEROR.
WHAT more matural than the introduction of the new police
@ l’Anglaise) in Paris? Was not the Emperor himself a model
“special?” Did not Louis NAPOLEoN, on a certain day in April, turn
out in defence of order, and collaterally, it may be, in defence of his
own portmanteau in the two-pair back of a modest habitation in the
parish of St. James's After this, it is true he turned out, or caused
others to turn out, in “defence of order,” on a certain day of fecember;
and the turn-out being very successful, why the Empire is the tremendous
result. . Nevertheless, the future philosophic historian,... profoundly
diving for causes, will discover in Louis NAPOLEoN's instinctive love
of order, as shown in April in the streets of London—the exile then
keeping watch, and ward as a sworn special—the forsworn love of
order as triumphant in the streets of Paris. The Emperor, in lieu of a
constable's staff, now flourishes an imperial sceptre; nevertheless, we
understand that, in memory of that constab event, Louis
Nºroison's staff will be enshrined at the Paris Police station (the
Scotland Yard in French) for the admiration and encouragement of all
the force. Beneath the weapon will run this inscription: “Courage/

HOW TO TEST A NATION'S PROSPERITY.
TRAVELLER, says, “I can
always judge of the pros-
perity of France...by the
condition of the Trees on
the Boulevards at Paris.
If the Trees are tall, noble
and towering, I know wel
enough that the kingdom
has been enjoying many
years’ internal peace and
a undisturbed prosperity ;
= but if, on the contrary, the
º Trees are poor, sickly,
short, and stunted, looking
as if they had been either
cut down or planted yester-
day, I know to a certainty
that the country is only
just recovering from a
recent revolution, or still
labouring under some great
civil convulsion.” He calls
the Trees on the Paris
Boulevards, “The leafy
barometers of France.”
-º-
THE GREAT TAPTUB CASE :
A very solemn inquiry has been entered upon, pursued, and carried
out by the Black Bull, the White Horse, the Pig-and-Whistle, the Red
Lion, and other distinguished, well-known conservators and comforters
of public morals, public benefactors, and publicans in general; an
inquiry having for its solemn object the discovery of a gifted creature,
who, by mature and accomplishment, shall best glorify the Morning
Taptub, making it another morning sun to the gladdened and uplifted
eyes and hearts of the human race in general, and of Britons in par-
ticular. Very exalting, very gratilying were the speeches made on the
occasion; especially the utterances that were made most musical, most
melancholy by their ring of morality and truth. A vain, coarse, un-
thinking generation has little thought of the greatness and purity of
purpose animating a Black Bull; has no suspicion whatever of the
deep note of morals and of truth roaring from the chest of the Red
Lion. The Three Jolly Pigeons are doves of tenderness, and the Cock
and Bottle, a Cock that furns up a jewel with every scratch |
The Pig-and-Whistle begged to put the editor of the Morning Tap-
tub on his trial. It was plain that the Taptub demanded the nursing
care of an editor who would join the wisdom of a MINERVA with the
thunderbolts of Jove ; a man whose leaders should be H. of gen-
tility, fragrant and with the dew upon them–fresh from the gardens of
rhetoric, so famous for its flowers. Now, how stood the case ? The
editor was not MINERVA; he hadn’t even the little finger of JUPITER:
and for flowers of rhetoric, what was to be thought of a benighte
individual, who, in this age of light and good manners, should so
degrade the Taptuff as to call a rival editor a “nincompoop º' (Cheers
and sensction.) The Pig-and-Whistle had thought such a word banished
from every self-respecting tap-room; nevertheless there it had been
found dimming and defiling the brightness and purity of the Morning
Taptuh ! : Again, had not the slumbers of Priscº Alient been dis.
turbed by the goose-quill of the editor; a goose-quill that had been
made to mix with other goose-feathers of the royal pillow : Again,
had not the editor declared the Protestant Church in danger from the
appearance of the many mediaeval mugs unrestrictedly exhibited in the
crockery shops of Regent Street, and the West End?... Moreover, the
editor in his sympathy with the Anti-Sabbath-Bung-Bill, had advocated
the extension of the measure, so that on Sundays ro day-light might be
served between the hours of two and six; and on no pretence whatever
should moon or stars shine or twinkle after ten. Viewing these things
with deep alarm, the Pig-and-Whistle moved that the editor of the
Morning Tapful should be invited to retire into that privacy of life that
his virtues, his morals, and his genius were so well calculated to adorn.
The Bear-and-Ragged-Staff, in a neat growl, seconded the motion.
MR. EDITOR rose for his defence. He had travelled much for the
Taptub, and not for his own health, his own pleasure. He had visited
salt mines (salt sometimes being used in beer); he had sought the site
of the Garden of Eden with a view to grains of Paradise. He had not
refused to tread the burning plains of Hindostan with a view to cocculus
Indicus / With respect to the use of the word “nincompoop,” he
must say, he thought it a good, bold, sinewy word that, properly ap-
}. would knock down an elephant, or even break the back of a
rime Minister | As for PRINCE ALBERT he entertained the highest
respect for that gifted individual, and believed that the feeling was
reciprocated with increased intensity. But he knew the object of the
present persecution; it was hatched in the scorpion bosom of the
Catholic Church. Let his enemies prevail, and he knew that in a
week—(he would not mention the name of CARDINAL NICEMAN)—in
a little week a pair of scarlet stockings would sit cross-legged under
the editorial desk of the outraged and betrayed Taptub /
After a very stormy debate, the Pig-and-Whistle's motion, was
carried by 176 to 149; and five minutes after the Editor followed the
motion in a sedan-chair. He, however, retires—and we are happy to
chronicle the fact—full of honours. Already the London Tavern, the
Freemasons', Dolly’s Chop-House, &c., have voted him the freedom of
their establishments. Joe's has sent, him the Qrder of the Gridiron;
and the Cheshire Cheese the Decoration of the Welsh Rabbit.
We cannot, however, dismiss this case without imploring the thought-
ful reader to mark the great moral and commercial advantages that, to
the public at large, must result from it. Of course, as the Witlers are
so resolute, so earnest in their determination to have nothing but
F. health, and strength in their newspaper, they will come to the
ike resolution with respect to the commodities of the bar. When an
editor is cashiered for indulging in such low syllables as “nincompoop,”
no censor wither can think of dealing in cocculus Indicus. Since we are
to have all purity in the Tapfuh, of course we shall have the like
unadulterated excellence in the glitterilig pewter'
A VIOLENT AGITATAR.
WE, cannot sufficiently express our disgust at the Tatar who has
hoaxed half Eurºpe by prematurely announcing the fall of Sebastopol.
Such a Tatar or Tatur ought to be immediately mashed, and severely
roasted. At the risk of being considered “vulgar” we must say to
all who make a mouth-piece of a mere Tatar or Tatur for promulgating
false news, “Come, come, let’s have none of this sort º: again,
so just shut your Tatur trap.”
THE ABUNDANT HARWEST.
THE thanksgiving for the abundant harvest was solemnised, with
peculiar fitness, in the parish church of Alum-cum-Potato. There, a
miller and a baker (they were picked out by lot) were compelled to
stand in the middle aisle during the service, dressed in a white sheet,
in penitence for the high price of bread, seeing that wheat had been so
abundant; and further, each of them being
“Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,
With harlocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
In our sustaining corn.”
A good significance in these crowns; showing that if benevolent
plenty sends us a heavy harvest, there is still the miller and the baker,
the “weeds” that grow upon the price of our sustaining bread!
MARINE PRIVILEGEs –The Admiralty have graciously made it
known to the Marines that, for the sake of uniformity, they may, in
common with the military, wear moustaches! After this liberal con-
cession, it is expected that the two forces will act with such unanimity
that there will not be a hair's difference between them.

SELECTIONS FROM PRINCE MENSCHIKOFFS
CARRIAGE.
+
HE DUKE OF NEwcASTLE
presents his compliments to
Mr. Punch, and in order to
avoid the difficulties which
arise from the present
system of distributing off-
cial information among the
daily journals, , the Duke
begs to say that all in-
teresting documents will in
future be forwarded to Mr.
Punch alone, but on the
condition, (in which the
Duke is assured of Mr.
Punch's acquiescence,) that
all the i. shall be at
liberty to copy such docu-
ments from Mr. Punch's
pages.
In conformity with this
understanding, the Duke
encloses a selection from
the correspondence found
in the captured carriage
of the RINCE MENs-
CHIKorf. The letters were
originally sent to Paris for
translation into French, and
- - have been re-translated by
a Clerk in the Foreign Office, whose grammar has been remarked, upon several
occasions, to be very tolerable. Official discretion has, of course, been used in
withholding passages which it seemed undesirable to publish.
No. 1.-A Young Lady of Sebastopol (family name unknown) to PRINCE
MENscHikoff.
“My DEAREST PRINCE,
“How amiable of you to propose to me and Marie so charming a pleasure
as that your delightful billet expresses. How truly good of you to reserve for us
two front places upon the scaffold raised to enable the ladies of Sebastopol to
behold #." defeat these wretched French and English. Accept, my dear Prince?
Decidedly I accept, with smiles of happiness, for my cousin and myself, and we
promise to do your invitation credit by our good looks and toilettes. We have
already hastened to MADAME, CRAMPOLINE. (who, assures us that though her
husband's name is French, her heart is Russian and your own—there, Prince, and
she is only 36), and have secured—but no. You ji see the effect, not hear
of it. We only hope that the horrid barbarians will not disappoint us, as you
seem to think possible, and that they will come to the attack. Savages as they are,
if they knew how many ladies depended on their boldness for a day’s pleasure, they
would certainly venture down to the Alma. However, we know you will do your
best for us, and we are deeply thankful. Our carriage shall be on the field by
half-past ten, or a quarter to eleven at latest. If you cannot come to put us into
our places, perhaps you will, send an aide de eamp; perhaps, ee cher petit PAUL
HAIRENorf. But we leave all to you. “Toute à toi, ELoise.”
No. 2.-Count OBENTHALLER, St. Petersburg, to PRINCE MENschikoff.
“My DEAR PRINCE, -
“I have, as you desired, hinted at your proposal, in the probable event
of your capturing the English and French generals, to knout them to death before
the army, as a moral lesson to Europe. He will not hear of it. They are to be
instantly forwarded to the capital, in irons. I do not advise you to neglect his
wishes. “Yours sincerely, O.”
(The writer of this letter is known from the Prinee having endorsed it. “From
OBENTHALLER. What I am to do with RAGLAN,” &c.)
No. 3.--THE MINISTER to PRINCE MENsch Ikoff.
“MY DEAR PRINCE," -
. “On no account must, you make another mistake. I am not in the habit
of using strong expressions, and therefore I trust te you to understand me when I
say that no probability, however painful, must be considered as too remote a cense-
quence of your deceiving NEva [the Emperor] *. In your despatch to him you
say that you can hold the A for three weeks. From what dropped from NEva, on
reading it, I advise you to hold it for six. For things are looking blacker and
blacker. We must have a victory in the course of the next fortnight. Werbum sap.
Qught I to add that Nºva has been #. well of Powder FLAsk, [PRINCE
PAsKIEwitch] lately, and hinting that if he had been in the C. no landing would
have been achieved?
“One word more. We have been friends. If you are deceiving him, send me—
before the explosion-powers to get your property over the frontier. Now you
understand. “Yours, in anxiety, NesselroDE.”
No. 4.—Secret Report made to the PRINCE by an Employé
unknown.
“In regard to the Colonels your Excellency has named
to me, I am able to report, with one exception. B. is
; the creature of T., who has lent him money for
gambling purposes. T. is discontent about the last promo-
tion, and has had nightly interviews with a Jew, pro-
fessedly a usurer, but probably a spy. W. I have followed
home several times; he resists my advances (in itself suspi-
cious); but I have bribed his servant, and obtained some
of his letters. "I do not think that I have as F. discovered
much, but he keeps a journal, which I shall get sight of.
Z. is at your mercy; he has appropriated regimental money.
I can get at the particulars. If I might advise, it would
be that your E. should, without exposing him, make him
aware ºf your *::::: and then depute him to bring
you information as to the private habits of F. and P., to
whom I cannot procure access. He may wince, but it is
better than ruin. The surgeon L. is also at your disposal;
he has sold all the bark from the medicine chest of the
regiment, and has certified, twice, that he has an ample
store. I think the Jew, M., sent it to Constantinople for
sale; but at any rate the chest, if suddenly opened, will
be found empty. The exception I alluded to, is young P.
who had formed a suspicion that I was on a scent, and
who called me a dishonourable ruffian and a spy, and kicked
me down stairs. But he has a love affair, through which
I shall be able to sound his views. He is a good and
amiable young man. This is all at present. May I humbly
remind your E. that my promotion will be most wº !
No. 5.-From a Resident in London [name withheld] to
PRINCE MENschikoff.
“I have received your instructions, but it would be
useless and dangerous to attempt to carry them out. I fear
that you deceive yourself, and judge our aristocracy by
four own. Your offer is munificent, but I should hardly
ave made him understand what you wanted him to find
out for you before I should be through the window... I
would even risk this for you, but his office is on the
first floor, and over a deep area with spikes. His being
poor, as you say you have heard he is (it is true), makes
no difference. esides, if you had a copy of the instruc-
tions, it would be too late now. ... I thank you much for
the £100—never was it more needed—and I would gladly
earn more, but it is impossible.”
No. 6.-From the EMPEROR NICHOLAs to PRINCE
MENscHIKoff.
“PRINCE,
. "I will not recur to the past. I will remember it
only in the event of the future resembling it.
“You inform me that you can hold the Alma for three
weeks against any force that can be brought against you.
For your own sake, as well as mine, I am willing to
believe that this time you have not miscalculated.
“I, too, have an almanac before me. This is the 10th of
September [the 22nd N. S.]. The enemy landed a week
ago. He can hardly have attacked you before this time,
but I give you the 8th, or 9th. [20th or 21st] for the
pleasure of receiving him. Alºj a week for the
transmission of news, I shall hear of his first repulse on
the 15th or 16th [27th or 28th), and I have ordered
illuminations for one of those nights.
“On the last day of the third week from the 9th Septem-
ber, you will send me a despatch apprising me that the
enemy is still at bay on the Alma, or you will yourself set
out from wherever you may be (resigning the command to
#. second in rank), to explain to me in person how you
ave dared that it should be otherwise.
“With this understanding I fervently implore the blessing
of all our holy saints upon you, and I kiss you.
“Your affectionate Father, N.”
No. 7.-Intereepted Letter from a Sailor belonging to the
“Agamemnon,” but on shore at the Old Fort, to his
brother, a private in the 23rd Regiment.

A COLLEGE OF REAL COOKERY.
(To the Shade of Cobb ETT.)
SHADE,
I Hope that you fine fellows who have left us look down upon
us sometimes as you are hovering about, and therefore that your eye
may meet these lines. Perhaps you know what I am about to tell you;
but if it be no news to you, it may still not have come yet to the
knowledge of some people below here, who will see this letter. Well
then, to make no further palaver about the business in hand, I have to
tell you that there is, really and truly, a College of Domestic
Economy, established at 54, Devonshire Street, Portland Place, for
the INSTRUCTION of LAD1Es, as well as of Female Servants, in House-
Hold MATTERs. Long ago I said there ought to be such an Institu-
tion. However, You had previously preached the true doctrine (unlike
some PARsons whom we know) that education ought principally to
consist in teaching those things which the learner's future Business
requires that he or she should know. That is my main reason for
writing to you now, to tell you about this College, at which ladies
are taught, not Latin and Greek, not ‘Geography, Astronomy, and
the Use of the Globes,” not to hammer away at the piano; no ; but the
CookING of Victuals, of all sorts, and the BAKING of BREAD, how
to make Pastry, Pies, and Tarts, and the sort of Globes called PUDDINGs.
That’s zummut like, bean’t it? as we say in Hampshire.
Observe, this CookERY College is both for ladies and servants, by
which latter are meant hired servants; for what do ladies expect to be
I should like to know, but servants? All ladies, except a few wretched
beings meant by nature for old maids, intend to get married; and of
course every wife is, or ought to be, the servant of her husband. Does
she not swear to obey him, in the ForM of SoleMNization of MATRI-
Mony (composed by ToM CRANMER)?—in return for which oath, on his
art, he swears that he will cherish her, and so forth. Of course, there-
ore, his servant she will be, unless she have sworn to A LIE. Now a
duchess may serve her husband by sitting in a drawing-room and talking
French, and Italian, and German, in his absence, to the various foreign
counts and other aliens who come calling, bowing, scraping, intriguing
and begging at his house: , but the only SERVICE which the majority §
ladies can render their husbands, otherwise than with the needle, is one
w be performed in the KitchFN.
Well but, however, this College of Domestic Economy is no
GAMMON. It is no sham. Åskº, concern, got up for the sake of
enabling fellows in black clothes, and white neckcloths, and green spec-
tacles, to prate about the “mission of woman.” It is a genuine under-
taking. We are told by its prospectus that—
| “Everything necessary to the acquirement of a perfect knowledge of domestic
economy will be taught."
And the truly sensible remark is added, that
“The Culinary Art will be the leading feature of the education given at the com-
mencement, it being the most required.”
It also says that
“The students for practice will be divided into classes of four or five each, with a
servant-student to attend on them and assist them in their operations.”
And it adds this most important proviso,
“The articles prepared to be consumed at the meals.”
I think I have now said enough to recommend this College to your
good wishes, and to the patronage of all whom it may concern; that is,
almost everybody who has, or expects to have a family. For the con:
venience of ladies who merely want to F. up hints, lectures, are
delivered on º hashing, braising, and so on; admission to which
| alone may be had; lessons also are given at so much a lesson.

JOHN BULL’S SHARE OF THE BATTLE.
I can’t draw the sword, and a helping hand afford,
The EMPEROR or Russia with my own fist to lick;
But I can draw my purse, that the doctor and the nurse
May do all that can be done for the wounded and the sick.
To hear my money chink, it pains me when I think,
Of RAGLAN’s gallant army in a state of distress
For bandages and lint, without strapping or a splint, ---
And the maimed in want of surgeons their injuries to dress.
My name isn’t John if they want diachylon,
Or proper hands the plaster and salve to apply,
And to bind up their gashes and close their cuts and slashes,
And to set their broken bones and their bleeding vessels tie.
When I’ve got the gout how it makes me holloa out,
And medical attendance to implore and beg!
What a hullaballoo, what a terrible to-do
I should make, if ſhad no one to dress my shattered leg!
Among Russian foes every shell our ordnance throws,
Is as many pounds in money as in weight flung away,
And I’ll shell out my brads too, among our noble lads,
Dressings, doctors, and assistants to send without delay.
A PLAGUE FOR THE CZAR.
WHAT will Nicholas, ever, do with our Russian º when we
return them on his hands? Undeceived, instructed, enlightened, will
they be suffered by the despot to intermingle with the rest of their
countrymen? But the old tyrant will find it no easy matter to prevent
them from propagating the infection of liberalism and civilisation
among his now barbarous and enslaved subjects. No quarantine will
purify them from the taint of that distemper, contracted in this island
of freedom. The Knout itself will not ſlog this poison out of them.
Poor Czar! What will he do with these dangerous fellows? Make
a clean sweep of them with grape and mitraille, sink them all in the
Baltic, or only send them to Siberia? This is a question for them to
consider before they trust themselves back again into the hands of
their Autocrat.
A Policy that Kills.
It seems that Prussia exercises great influence over the Bund; but,
if the latter listens to Prussia's hesitating voice much longer, we are
sorely afraid that in a short time the German Bund will be very little
better than a MoRI-BUND.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MAN WITH THE MILD EYES.
GENTLEMEN who ad-
mire the EMPEROR OF
Russia’s eyes, and
call him “a fine
fellow,” are requested
to read the following
extract from the
Times—the statement
of an actual witness.
The narrator is speak-
ing of the earthwork
carried by SIR Colin
CAMPBELL and the
Highlanders:–
“The oldest generals
declare that in no battle
heretofore fought have so
many dead been heaped
up in one spot. It would
be impossible to describe
to you the frightful scene
which I witnessed in the
square mile comprising
this earthwork, the slope
beneath it, and the slope
above it, upon which were
formed the enormous
squares of the Russian
infantry. The greater
part of the English killed
and wounded were here,
and there were at least
five Russians to every
Englishman. You could
not walk for the bodies.
The most frightful muti-
lations the human body
can suffer—the groans of
the wounded, the packs,
helmets, arms, clothes,
scattered over the ground,
all formed a scene that
one can never forget.”
There is more of the same kind where
This will do for these pages.
that came from: and worse. Fancy the eyes of Nicholas-those
eyes, which LIEUTENANT Royer tells us are “expressive of mildness”
-beholding the scene of slaughter on the Heights of, Alma, lambent,
in gazing thereon, with a mildness getting gradually ecstatic; rap-
turous: till they glow, with an expression absolutely seraphical; and
the courtenance, and ultimately the whole figure, of the NUN-whipPER,
boots and all, are transformed—for we know that the thing is possible
—into the image of an Angel of Light.
Poor LIEUTENANT Roy ER!—but let us be considerate in what we
say of an officer who was under fire in the Tiger. That fire, doubtless,
astonished the Lieutenant much less than the gentle radiance that
streamed from the eyes of the EMPEROR of Russia. JACK Roy ER—
JACK–we take leave thus to abbreviate ALFRED–no doubt º
that he was going to see, in the Russian monster, the likeness of DAVY
Jones. Scales of a blue or green colour, a tail with a sting at the
end of it, grinning fangs, cloven feet, and eyes glowing with sulphurous
and red flames instead of being “expressive of mildness,” were per-
haps the elements which the unsophisticated seaman supposed he
should find united in the person of the CzAR: and such, indeed, might
be a º portrait of the Russian Gentleman as, he would appear in
a state of things wherein the external is conformed to the interior.
LIEUTENANT Roy ER may also have made his mind up that the
Autocrat would order him to be knouted to death, or at the very least
send him in chains to Siberia. He never read the stories about Ogres
who could be wonderfully civil, to gentlemen in their castles and in
their power—when it suited their purpose. Doubtless, those Ogres
subdued the hungry glare wherewith they were disposed to regard the
strangers to an expression of great mildness., . No wonder Nicholas
was “much amused” at his captive's exhibition of “surprise and
embarrassment” when he set him at liberty; as much, doubtless, as
old Rothschi LD used to be at the astonishment of the beggar to
whom he would occasionally throw a guinea, for fun.
To give NICHOLAs his due (according to the adage) he is a fine actor.
An actor on the stage of real life and a hypocrite, are the same thing.
Having a foul name to cleanse in the eyes of the British Public, what
dodge would it be more natural for him to try than that of doing the
magnanimous to the English prisoner? Gustavus WASA BROOKE
would have produced the same impression on LIEUTENANT Roy ER, if
he had been playing the CzAR in Romanoff's boots, and if GUSTAvus
WASA can perform as well as NICHOLAs.
Sinope, Qltenitza, Citate, Bomarsund, the Heights of Alma; per-
haps, ere this, Sebastopol !—given these scenes only of carnage: how
large a mound of corpses; what heaps of lost limbs: how numerous a
variety of lacerations, and attendant agonies: what amount, in tuns,
of bloodshed; how many wretches starved, ruined, burnt out of house
and home? Here is a sum for Europe and civilised mankind to do.
And the answer will be a figure to be put down to the account of the
man of mild eyes: simply because he cast those eyes of mild desire on
his neighbour's dominions. - - - -

DISRAELL IN A BEER-BARREL.
MR. DISRAELI being at Plymouth, certain licensed victuallers
addressed him on their wrongs. They wanted protection. They did
not ask the hon. gentleman to employ his genius for the protection of
beer from thunderbolts; but against further legislation. An un:
hallowed attempt was about to be made that should destroy that wested
right—the right of licensing. The beer trade was to be thrown open
to the unprincipled sons of Free Trade. There was to be no longer a
monopoly of cocculus Indicus; and grains of Paradise were to be freely
used by the lowest capacity. In this dilemma, and MR. DISRAELI
being at Plymouth for the benefit of the sea-breezes—in this dilemma,
to whom could the witlers appeal but to the member for Bucks? The
right hon, member gave courteous ear to the complaint of the oppressed,
and would do his best for them. What a changel “May we not
trace the noble brain of BENJAMIN, until we find it stopping a beer-
barrel !” We would advise the author of the Great Taptubopolis to
enter Parliament, and boldly intercept the wreath of hops in its way to
the brow of DisRAELI.

produced? Do not all speak at once. Well then—

What do you say to that? For whether, as a #. and
euphonious name, or whether as the memorial of a brilliant victory, or
whether for its own private Latin signification—gentle—the name
strikes me as perfection. Let me hear your opinions.
Your affectionate Friend,

LIEUTENANT MAXSE’s RIDE.
AFTER Alma's glorious battle, ;
Said, “I wish DUNDAs could know it.”
I'm your man.”
Would,” said RAGLAN, “he could bring his fleet to Balaklava Bay.”
Maxse said, “I’ll ride back, then, to him, and inform him what you
say.
“But,” said RAGLAN, “my good fellow, round us hover the Cossacks,
Thousands of those rascals scour the country.” “They be dashed!”
said MAxse. -
“But, in case the thieves should catch me, write not what you have
RAGLAN, having changed his plan,
“Well,” said Maxse, “then
to tell,
I by word of mouth will bear it.” RAGLAN answered, “Very well.”
MAxse forthwith upon his pony leapt, and galloped right away,
Whilst the brave spectators theered him, shouting “Hip, hip, hip,
ooray!”
Qn the º, track returning, through the tangled wood he sped,
Dashing mid the stiffest thickets, which he butted with his head.
Down, before him goes the cover; hazel, and young oak, and ash;
And the hares and rabbits scamper round him while the branches crash,
At the sticks full tilt he charges; every stick, that bends not, cracks,
Drambles tear his coat and trowsers: go it, pony! go it, Maxse!
Through the forest, through the meadow, MAXSE for dear life rides his
race;
Time there’s none to look behind him: Cossacks may, or not, give
Chase.
Bullets after him may whistle; whizzing by he hears them not,
Why? ºus the brave LIEUTENANT's gallant steed outstrips the

Hedge, ditch, wall, gate, fence and paling, brook and rivulet he clears,
Swims the torrent, having plunged thereinto souse !, head over ears,
Tramples pigs, and scatters sheep and goats that on the pastures browse,
Goes clean over the old women, and the oxen, and the cows.

DEFEND YOUR MAYOR.
MR, Punch, in token of the affectionate and devoted loyalty which
he feels towards the new King of the º and being desirous to protect
his civic sovereign from a mass of wit, which there is toº much reason
to believe would otherwise be launched against his Majesty, doth
hereby order as follows:
That no person do, for the space of one year from Lord Mayor's
Day next ensuing, presume to make any jokes whatever founded upon
the fact that his lordship's name is spelt with the same letters as
that of the luminary which is appointed to attend upon this earth.
And with the view of better preventing, much dreary jocularity, the
following, and all kindred witticisms, though included inthe above order,
are specially forbidden. -
If the Lond MAYOR should not attend upon any occasion when his
lordship has been expected, no one is to say that the Moon is eclipsed.
If the Lord Mayon’s healthis drunk, no one, as his lordship proceeds
to reply, is to say, “Rise, gentle McQN.”
If the LoRD MAYoR goes to Windermere next autumn, no country
journalist is to head his account of such excursion, “The Moon's on
the Lake.” --- -
If the LoRD MAyoº makes a remark, no one is to call it a Lunar
Observation. -- -
If the LoRD Maxon knocks anybody down (and it is, to be, hoped
that in the case of any violation of these orders, his lordship will doso
either personally, or by athletic deputy), such person is not to be calle
Moonstruck.
If one of the Hammersmith omnibuses comes between the Loºn
º and a spectator, the latter is not to talk of the Moon behind
a-U10tlu.
If the Lond Mayor invites MR. CHARLEs KEAN, MR. JAMEs
ANDERson, MR. Gustavus Brooke, MR. BARRY SULLIy AN, MR. N.T.
Hicks, Mr. WENTwo RTH. Butler, and MR. JAMEs W. Wºck to
dinner, no theatrical journal (even if his lordship should survive the
occasion) is to quote anything about “The Moon and the Seven Stars.”
If the LoRD MAYon requests Miss CATHERINE Hayes to sing at the
Mansion House, no person is to predict wet weather from the fact of
there being a Haze near the Moon. -
If one of those wonderful correspondents of the Sunday Times, who
ask for the most elaborate antiquarian and philological information
(how º that HAYps's Dictionary of Dates always opens with
a reply) should not have inquired, what is the height of the LoRD
MAYor, our learned, but still facetious contemporary is not to say-
“You are wrong. The Moon's altitude is 5 feet iſ inches.” -
If the Loºp Mayor is upon any particular occasion more witty
!. º (if possible), no person is to remark “The Moon shines
o-night.”
If the LoRD Mayor looks at the thermometer to see whether the
weather be warmer or colder, than that of the preceding, day, no
astrological donkey is to say that the Moon is in apposition to Mercury.
Any person ºf any of the above rules is to be liable, for the
first offence, to be called a Pump, and for the second, to be placed
under one, the handle to be worked by
398:152C#.
The Deserted One of Downing Street.
THE'Court Newsman informs us, that on Tuesday “the Lord Chan-
cellor arrived in town and visited the Duke of Newcastle.” It was
yery kind and considerate of the Chancellor to come to town and look
in upon the Duke, who, while all his colleagues have been enjoying
their vacation, has been “alone in his glory” in Downing Street. . His
Grace would have had a dull time of it indeed, but for an occasional
conversation with the porter who fills the Government scuttles, and
who came into the Duke's room now and then for the purpose of
carrying coals to NEwcASTLE.
The University of the Army.
WE congratulate our QUEEN and our country on the progress that
education has made in the British army;...It is a #"; fact that
the officers and men constituting the expedition to the Crimea have all
taken high honours at their Alma Mater.
Not Always so Easy.
ONE of the provisions of the Oxford University Reform Act is, that
“Statutes may be made and altered, and the Congregation may speak in English."
Ah!—that is, of course, if they can.

MAKING GAME OF POETRY.
We shall no longer despair of the project for extracting
sumbeams from cucumbers since it has been found practi.
cable to get a poem, in four cantos, out of the Aiº, of
CHEss. #. some time past we have noticed the advertise-
ment of the work to which we allude, and we may therefore
look in due time for “Backgammon, an Epic, in sixteen
books,” and “Dominos, a Lyric in six octavo volumes, with
a supplement in three.” Since the happy days of prolixity,
when PETERspoRFF launched on the world his famous
“Abridgment” in nineteen volumes, and his equally famous
addenda in about sixteen more, we have met with nothing
to equal the poem of chess in four cantos-extra boards.
Nevertheless, the subject is not a bad one for the poet’s
art. The ground work is chequered, the King and Queen
give scope for the introduction of the dignifying element
of royalty, the knights open the way, to romance, the
castles are suggestive of chivalry, the bishops invite the
poet to a display of ecclesiastical learning, while the pawns
lead naturally to the necessitudes,...disappointments, and
º pledges of every day life. Altogether there
may be many inferior subjects for a poem, than the subtle
game of chess.
Jonathan's Baby Show.
A Show of American babies—according to the Cincinnati
| Gazette—was to take place in Springfield on the 5th instant.
The prizes were various. There were to be three complete
silver tea-sets for the mothers of the three finest babies of
three different ages. Doubtless, it is very right that the
mothers of the finest babies should be rewarded, but are the
| rºs to have nothing? If this omission be not amended,

IDecline of Irish Humour.
It has been for some time remarked that the Irish
character is undergºing an alteratiºn. The Belfast Trade
- Report confirms this observation. It states that
*Yarns continue as dull as possible.”
A complete change, therefore, appears to have taken
place in the character of Irish anecdote.
WRITES. To
POVERTY AND PROPERTY.
A woman of poverty (her name is not given by the Incumbent of
erstone), together with her family, make the most heroic sacrifices
in aid of a “family upstairs,” fellow-lodgers, visited with the cholera.
Children die, other children are smitten, and the mother asks leave to
lie down awhile “in the bed belonging to the other family.” She does
so, and—
“From that time until her own death, which took place yesterday morning [Oct. 6],
the whole of the second family have never had their clothes off, nor have they laid
down on a bed; and this act of self-denial has been borne without a murmur or
complaint.”
This is only another illustration of the benevolence of the poor towards
the poor. Without the poor, what would the poor do?—is an old,
searching question: a question that may, at times, put property to the
blush in the attempt to answer it. To this benevolence of poverty,
let us now oppose a case of the selfishness of property.
. The scene is Worship Street Police Office. Alady named Robinson
“the owner of large leasehold property in Marlborough Court and
other places in Whitechapel,” is complained of by Inspector PRICE (a
most vigilant and enlightened officer), for neglect of sanitary precau-
tions. Marlborough Stye, the inspector—
“Found the houses so densely occupied by tenants of the lowest class, each room
being apparently tenanted by a separate family, that upon counting the tenants, who
were in many instances promiscuously huddled together, he found there were no less
than 157 grown-up persons of both sexes, and 111 children.”
And yet can it be said—pecunia non olet & Has, indeed, lucre no smell
—notaint—when obtained by way of rent for such dens of disease;
such cholera-beds, but one remove from charmel-places?
“There was a total absence of the necessary drainage, the cesspool had overflowed,
forming stagnant pools in the yard, from which was emitted an effluvium of the most
pestilent and dangerous character. Several cases of cholera had occurred among the
wretched inhabitants, and the continuance of such a revolting nuisance was calculated
to engender disease of the worst description.”
Yet, possibly, this fact did not break, the nightly rest of MRs.
RQBINSON. She, it may be, still enjoyed “rosy dreams and slumbers
light,” the weekly rents still accruing. MRs. Robinson's agent
implored for time; “hoped the magistrate would suspend the immediate
execution of the summons,” as the herd of lodgers should very soon be
put in lavender. M.R. HAMMILL, however, was obstinate, and MRs.
RoBINson must immediately set about cleansing her Marlborough
stye. Possibly, too, she would like to make some reparation for past
neglect; in which case we beg to refer her to the incumbent of Hag-
gerstone, who will gladly be her almoner for her poorer and more
heroic sisters.
WHITE FEATHERS.
How wonderfully easy does the British officer make a seeming
impossibility! In the field of battle he wears the white feather, yet
never shows it.

A BROADSIDE FROM THE BLACK SEA.-
* The Russians had abandoned the light-house on the Western Cape, and extinguished the beacon. Our men have occupied the tower and re-kindled the light."—
WHILE the Russians, cowed and craven,
Under Ahktiar's batteries hide,
Deep in Balaklava's haven, .
Lo the fleets of England ride l
Since the tall mast gilt and graven
Of the Viking, far and wide,
Bore the bloody-beaked Norse Raven–
No such Flag all flags defied
Yet how many flags that water
Hath reflected, since of yore,
Shipwrecked wretches, saved for slaughter,
Stained the Taurian temple's floor;
Where pale AGAMEMNoN’s daughter
As the votive lock she shore
From a victim's head they brought her,
Knew a brother's face once more.
Here the grim Warangian rover,
His sea-dragons would embay:
Stalwart swordsman, lusty lover,
Frank at feast, and freck in fray.
All the world's wide waters over,
With his war-axe cleaving way;
Hovering, as the ospreys hover,
Ere they swoop upon their prey.
Hither came Byzantium's galleys, B
Gilded stems, and sails of grain,
For the wine of Ktenian valleys,
And the corn of Taphrae's plain.
Hither, on their venturous sallies,
Genoa sent her merchant train–
Fraudful friends, and treacherous allies,
Keen for conquest, as for gain.
Where the Chersonese advances Wh
Westernmost to meet the sea,
Stands a beacon-light that dances
O'er the waters, watchfully;
Through all changes, and all chances,
Whoso uppermost may be,
Through the night that Pharos glances,
For wave-wandering eyes to see.
Cymric hands its fires have tended;
Greeks have fed its friendly blaze;
Dark Khazars its flame have mended,
Norse Vikinger nursed its rays.
Tatar hordes, their way that wended
Hitherward from Akhtiar's bays,
Still the helpful light defended,
Guide o'er ocean's darksome ways.
Till—when both Khazar and Tatar,
Norse and Greek had passed away,
When proud Genoa ceased to barter,
And the Moslem ceased to slay—
Russia's lascivious daughter,
Witch in wiles and man in sway,
After TschESMt's fearful slaughter,
Saw these shores her nod obey.
Since that day, the beacon scorning
To be dimmed, whoe'er its lord,
Still the brow of night adorning
O'er the sea its light has poured.
But no more like star of morning
the sailor’t was
Guidance gave it none, but warning
From a coast accurst, abhorred.
Far it shone—the scene revealing
Qf dark deeds that shame our time;
Where men thrive by double-dealing;
And the basest highest climb;
Where foul fraud kills noble feeling,
ere free speech or thought is crime,
Outward polish ill-concealing
Barbarous nature 'neath its slime.
For a time, but not for ever
Such things are—to shame our pride.
V. THE RE-KINDLING OF THE BEACON.
Letter from the Sea of War.
But God's justice slumbers never,
Though the sword awhile she hide.
Lo, at length, the chains to sever,
That have stretched so far and wide,
And the nations to deliver,
France and England side by side 1
Cowed before that high alliance,
Russia's hosts are fain to flee,
While, in glorious defiance,
Our great navies sweep the sea.
Strong in justice—in reliance
On our cause, what fear can be *
Shall slavish gold or slavish science,
Or slavish myriads daunt the free ?
On that cape, the Russian flying,
from our fleets and armies bold,
Left the ancient beacon lyin
ln its ashes, black and cold.
"Twas well done—for in its dying
That still shone from days of old-
War and elements defying—
Emblem of their fate behold.
Russia's star for ever faded,
As that beacon sunk in gloom;
But bold hands by true hearts aided,
Take the knaves' and cowards' room.
Hither through their blood they’ve waded,
The old tower to re-illume—
Shine again! nor e'er be shaded
Till the awful day of doom—
Shine—a light that none shall smother—
Shine across an open sea;
Shine, for brother greeting brother;
Shine, for slavery made free ;
Shine, for men's love of each other;
Shine, for commerce, toil and glee;
Shine, for Progress—mighty mother
Of the good that yet shall be
adored—
IDOUBLEUBEESIORAUS.
Rof EssoR Owen has hitherto exhibited
no specimens of this animal. Every-
body has a passing acquaintance with
the Plesiosaurus, the Megatherium,
and so forth, that the visitor sweeping
round the corner on his way to the
Crystal Palace, beholds in grim repose
amid pre-Adamite deposits; but, we
repeat it, the Doubleubeesioraus, that
marks the good old time of corn laws,
top boots, and leather breeches, that
animal specimen is only to be found
at Castle Hedingham. The creature—
for some strange, mysterious purpose
—endowed for a time, with articulate
utterance, talked to the agricultural
mind." The "ijoubleubee observed:
“I want to know nothing more than what I already know of Popery,”
a fact very gratefully received by the company. And then the
Doubleubee spoke of “that rascal FLEw KER;” also of a letter
written to that individual, in which that letter speaks of “strong
religious and Protestant principles as to my mind the foundation of
true conservatism.” Perjury may sometimes come to the help of
conservatism, just as, pepper gives heat and flavour, to cookery.
DoubleUBEE confessed to the remorse of having voted against his
conscience for SIR JAMEs GRAHAM, whom he never could abidel
“Talented as he is, I never could bear that evil eye, that sinister look, that brazen
meretricious leer, and the braggart, impudent face which he puts on to cover as dastard
a heart as ever beat beneath a coat 1"
This is a good specimen of strength of words! Among the pre-
Adamite animals, there are marvellous indications of power, but
nothing equal to this...The Megalosaurus had, it is supposed, a most
wonderful swing of tail, but what is that when, with the above in our
mind, we think of the potency of the Doubleubeesioraus—its indomitable
strength of cheek, * invincible power of jaw 1
THE SPIRIT OF FOLLY.
THE following advertisement opens out a perfect Australian gold
field with which quackery and humbug ma ºf no doubt be tempted
to extend their “diggins.” We had thought all the forms of imbecility
had been pretty well worked up in the hands of swindlers and impos-
tors, but here we have a new phase of intellectual softness, offering its
plastic self to the manipulations of the regular professional victimiser
or the artful dodger:
A GENTLEMAN, curious in such matters, wishes to find a person
capable of SEEING and SHOWING VISIONS in the CRYSTAL, or otherwise
acquainted with Spiritual Divination. Address to “Box," at G. Ramsden's, Stationer,
Vicar Lane, Leeds.
We see scarcely any limit to the amount of “visions” which will be
offered to the gullibility of this confessedly “curious "gentleman. We
can imagine the rapid succession of “visions,” complete with “baseless
fabrics” which would be presented to the advertiser by an adroit
schemer on the Stock Exchange. We can fancy the beautiful
“bubbles” that could be blown expressly for the gentleman, desirous
of “seeing visions,” and we can conceive his admiration and surprise
at seeing them dissipated into “thin air,” and thus substantiating—by
their total want of substance—their visionary character. There may
also be another class of visions introduced to the notice of the “curious
gentleman” through the medium of the “crystals” or glasses, and
that “spiritual” agency—including cordial and other compounds—to
which the “gentleman” seems to point in the latter part of his adver-
tisement. ... “Visions” may be seen at any public house by placing the
“Crystal” frequently to the mouth, provided the º ” is fully
charged with that “spiritual” essence, which our advertising friend
has alluded to. We do not envy the postman the work he will have to
do in carrying the correspondence that will be addressed to “Box”—a
characteristic name no doubt, though we think some softer wood would
have been more appropriate.
Kudos Fon DoNALD.—The Russian, snake, has been scotched at

ment. Not only will

but also extremely

in the direction of England and France. The change has been submitted to the King, and he
has been pleased to highly approve of it, and indeed an emblem of Prussia with two heads could

“A BLIGHTED BEING.”
MR. Robson, at the Olympic, great as he is in, his wretchedness, is not the only blighted
being. There is also a Blighted Being in the French, namely M. BARBFs. #. is
released from gaol, and he is broken hearted His prison doors, by imperial command,
are thrown open, and what lies before him? The sunny path of liberty? Certainly not; but
the wide, wide, cold, cold world: its road strewed with shards and skirted with briars. He
was, happy, quiet, and content in his stone dungeon, as toad in the heart of a block of
marble; but the stone is broken, º: is let in, and it is too much for the eyes and
brain of the liberated....He is from that moment a blighted being, scorched, withered,
paralysed by the quality of mercy, dew-like descending upon him. What right had
the imperial despot, Louis NAPOLEoN, to degrade the patriot BARBés with the blighting
gift of freedom? M. BARBEs was patriotically at work, cutting on blade-bones, in
beautiful relief, a whole series of scenes of the coup d'état. Those bones—like the
engraved º of BARoN TRENck—would have perpetuated the memory of that gigantic
wickedness; and now, with the twentieth blade-bone in his hand, he is turned forth into that
wilderness, the outside worldſ who is to wonder that Bºs should kick, bite, spurn at
such tyranny?....How writes he, the noble, bursting heart?—“I shall pass two days at
Paris, to allow time to replace me in prison, and that period once over, on Friday night I shall
o into exile.” He has been as good and as bitter as his word; he is now in Brussels, we
ope on his way to London; when-such is sympathy—he must visit the Qlympic Theatre.
Great will be the attraction to behold at the same time Two Blighted Beings!—Robson
blighted on the boards, and BARBEs blighted in a stage-box!
THE GROWTH OF A NEW SUBURB.
FIRst come the masons and bricklayers. As the houses begin to rise from the ground,
After the º come in due time the
baker, grocer, and butcher, who are quickly followed by the tobacconist, and the barber,
who sells peg-tops and newspapers on the Sunday. The doctor follows next, and after
him comes, as a matter of course, the undertaker; and lastly, when the new Suburb has fairly
settled down, and has got i. water, new milk, and a policeman of its own, arrives the
Lawyer. The arrival of the Lawyer is always a sure sign that the new Suburb is getting on
well, and it is a singular fact, that though the Lawyer is generally the last to come, he is
invariably the last to go. The poor-house soon rears its chevaux-de-frised head as a natural
consequence, and as long as there is a 8. in it, or a man in the new Suburb to make a
pauper of, the Lawyer never leaves it. Once firmly located, nothing short of an earthquake,
or universal emigration, or perpetual cholera, will get him to move—but then we know it is
not in the nature of a lawyer to be easily moved. -
A Proper Precaution.
THE French band of the Emperor's “Guides,” who are to visit us to play in aid of the

Authors’ Society bound in a very heavy bond that, being the last French novelties, they

WHAT IS THE GERMAN's
FATHERLAND P
WHAT is the German's Fatherland?
The world would like to understand,
And why the German holds it worth
More than another tract of earth?
Is it a land of bright sunshine?
Is it a land of corn and wine?
Abounding, all the world above?
That Fatherland which Germans love.
Who, for itself alone; would prize
The land of finest scenes and skies?
Or care a fig about its fruits,
If they but served to fatten brutes?
The Fatherland of Germans, then,
Should be a land of noble men;
A land of arts, and arms, and lore,
Their Fatherland should be, therefore.
In learning, glºrious art and song,
The German's Fatherland is strong:
Arms, too, the brave Teutonic breed
To wield, like men, are good at need.
But parcelled out that land we see
Which should be all entire and free:
Each weak state owns a despot's rule:
One strong one that of one weak fool.
With strings of apron basely tied,
By means of sister or of bride,
Are these mere satraps of the Czar
- To their Imperial Master's car.
What, Germans' honest men, and true,
And shall they also harness you?
You to that chariot shall they bind
"Whose wheels but move to crush mankind? .
If }. will crouch, and kiss the ground,
Before those poor old women crowned,
The dirt, whereon you dare not stand,
That is the German's Fatherland.

ENCOURAGEMENT FOR ARMY SURGEONS.
WHETHER our forces have, or have not, been provided with sufficient
surgical aid in the Crimea, it appears that the French troops at least
have been well off in that respect. Our allies have adopted a remarkably
clever plan to "ensure a plenty of good surgeons for their wounded
soldiers and sailors With a wisdom which must astonish our Govern-
ment, they afford them the same inducement as other officers to serve
their country. For instance, according to the Moniteur, M. LAU-
VERGNE, first physician-in-chief in the navy, has been promoted to the
ank of officer, in the Legion of Honour. #ven ordinary medical prac-
titioners are accounted by the French Government members of an
honourable profession: for in the same paper we read that two surgeons,
MM. MACRET and LAMBERT, have been appointed Chevaliers of the
Legion of Honour, for their devotion to the sick during the raging of
the cholera at Toulon. In this country the highest distinction awarded
ordinarily to medical men is no higher than that ordinarily awarded to
eminent grocers. . Government does not consider a doctor to be, as
such, too much of a philosopher to care about titles. It knights him.
by way of reward for merit. It thinks his profession as dignified as
that of a tea-dealer, and no more. In these days of degenerate
knighthood a snob, as aristocracy calls a tradesman, may be made a

snobbish avocations, and a regimental surgeon as doing a lowish kind
of duty even when performing a capital operation with a cool head and

THE PIANO IN THE FARM-HOUSE.
MR. PUNCH quite agrees with the sentiments respecting the piano
and farmers' wives, which MR. C. R. Colvile meant to express at the
Sparkenhoe Farmers’ Club Dinner; but then, if Mr. Punch had been
MR. Colville, he would have said what he meant, and not the reverse.
MR. CoLVII.E, of course, was joking: but never venture on irony with
ladies, or farmers either, still less with both together; your joke will
most likely create a disturbance, as his did; and what is worse, you
may also have to explain it; which, likewise, was his unhappy case.
The following betises, as the remarks in question were universally
denominated by the ladies of the Sparkenhoe farmers, are reported by
the Sun to have been delivered by that unlucky gentleman, in proposing
“The Ladies,” as a toast. Having noticed the circumstance of their
presence as a new feature in agricultural meetings, and alluded to a
notion generally prevalent, that farmers' wives were “too proud for
their business,” undeterred by the disapprobation which followed these
words, MR. Colvile thus injudiciously proceeded :—
* “It is, therefore, that I have observed with the greatest pleasure so many fair faces
around me, and see them take an interest in agricultural affairs; for, depend upon it,
if you intend to make a good dairy of cheese, you have not too much time to play upon
the piano."
Well; then came the storm which might have been expected. Had
Mr. Punch been in the place of MR. Colville, the papers would have
had to report the subjoined observations in place of the above:-
Mr. Punch, in proposing the toast of “The Ladies,” said: “In the
discharge of the pleasing duty which has been confided to me, I cannot
sufficiently express my gratification at the sight of the ladies who have
done us the honour ºcoming here. Their presence on this occasion
refutes the vulgar calumny which asserts that farmers' wives are above
their business. This vile slander is grounded on the circumstance that
the accomplishment of music is general amongst them. They are
accused of playing upon the piano, And why should they not—when
they have nothing else to do? All work and no play—we know what
the consequence of that is; and if farmers’ ladies must have some
playing, what can they play better than the piano?. Are they to go
jingling about with the cupboard-keys and the keys of the cellar con-
tinually, and never rattle over the ivory keys by way of a change of
key? Then it is said that if they want a good dairy, there must be no
piano-playing That is, I suppose, for fear what is called a thundering
accompaniment should turn the milk sour. Fiddlestick! When a
farmer comes home of an evening he requires amusement 3 he does not
always want to go to sleep—and what else can he go to ?—he has no
theatre, no concert, no Exeter Hall. Then what can be more suitable
to his circumstances than that his wife should sit down at her instru-
ment, and give him a bit of music. Suppose she plays something from
HAYDN's Seasons—for instance, ‘With cheerfulness the husbandman: ”
is not that just the sort of thing to raise his spirits, when perhaps they
are depressed by the circumstance that the weather is bad for the
corn; or if good for the corn, bad for the turnips? Or she might per-
form a selection from Acis and Galatea, that beautiful composition of
HANDEL's, so pastoral in its expression, and therefore so calculated to
soothe his mind when anxious on account of his live stock. Well then
she may refresh that affection which is the source of domestic happi-
ness, by means of some tender melody of MozART's : and there are
many passages in BEETHove N’s works by which she might awaken
those sensibilities, which the grandeur and beauty of that Nature,
amid whose glories he exercises his calling, do not perhaps always
arouse as much as they ought in the mind of the British Farmer.
Or should he, as may sometimes be the case, have not quite enough
spirituality in him to understand that sort of thing, she might
at least amuse, his ear, and accelerate his slumber by the pleasant
tinkle of a polka. Talking of that, I would venture to express
the hope that the refining influence of music in the rural dis-
tricts will ultimately reach the agricultural labourer, for whose im-
rovement we are all so anxious; insomuch that no long time will elapse
efore the harvest home is held in the drawing-room, and whilst the
ploughmen take the milkmaids gracefully around the room, the farmer's
wife sits down at the piano, and plays the Schottische or the Cellarius.”
Qf course this speech would have been received with mild *:
and gentle laughter; and instead of the following sentiment having
been proposed in consequence:
“Here's to the wife of a jolly good farmer, who can make a jolly good cheese, and
play a jolly good tune on a jolly good piano to a jolly good family,"—
which indicates a very late hour and a yet more advanced state of beer;
the º rkenhoe farmers would have given “The health of our gallant

THE ONE SHOP A-LIGHT IN THE STREET.
IN one of the chief thoroughfares of
one of the chief cities
of the world, there
exists a money-grub in
the form of a hosier.
All the other hosiers
in that thoroughfare
have, for the last two
years, closed their
shops at eight o'clock
in the evening, so as
to allow theirassistants
some little time dail
to keep up the intel-
lect, recruit the facul-
ties, and exercise the
affections which dis-
tinguish the human
being from the ox and
the ass and the pig.
But this grub of a
hosier persists in keep:
ing his shop open till
nine or ten at night;
hence fears are enter-
tained that the rest of
the neighbouring ho-
siers will be obliged
in self-defence toreturn
to the old barbarous
system of keeping their
shops open equally
- - - - late.
Deputations without number, consisting both of employers and
º have, we understand, repeatedly waited on this sock-seller,
and vainly endeavoured to prevail upon him to abandon his greedy
practice of late closing. To all their remonstrances and entreaties a
deaf ear has been turned º the obstinate and incorrigible snob.
The hosiers' assistants of the city alluded to, who have published the
above-mentioned particulars in a handbill, further observe that the greedy
“party” who keeps the hosiery nighthouse in the thoroughfare in
uestion, will be at once discovered by means of a walk, through that
thoroughfare after eight o'clock in the evening. They also point out
that by simply abstaining from the purchase of any hosiery subsequently
to that hour, the inhabitants of the said city may M. the early
closing hosiers from the loss now accruing to them, from competition,
at a disadvantage, with those who close late.
We hope the residents of the Boulevard des Italiens will carefully
º: that great thoroughfare on the first convenient evening
ive minutes after eight, mark the hosier whose shop remains open,
and book his name. We trust that the people of Broadway, New York,
will do the like. -
And lest—but the thing is almost impossible—lest there should, per-
adventure, dwell any, such linseywoolsey caitiff in the midst of our
metropolis—lest, perchance any such worsted polypus should infest the
heart, of London—suppose, good fellow citizens, we also take a walk
together the first convenient evening, shortly after eight—say—through
Cheapside.

“CoME ALONG, OLD FELLow ! HERE's A PoſNT | | *
DISRAELITAND THE FIFTH OF NOWEMBER I
At Exeter, on the Fifth of November, there is to be a grand exhibi-
tion of fireworks in honour of Protestant ascendancy! In humble
imitation of the City managers who, º requisition, wooed and won
G. W. BrookE to pass through Temple Bar, a committee is about to be
formed at Exeter to invite MR. DisrAELI, as the Protestant champion
in especial, to preside over the pyrotechnics. “If MR. DisRAELI would
place himself at the head of the Protestant feeling of this country, he
would soon be exalted to permanent and immoveable power.” . Thus
saith the Standard. He would, in fact, go up like the rocket, and there
should never be a coming down of the stick.
We think the invitation of MR. DISRAELI peculiarly felicitous. The
Protestant mind of the country sees in DIsrAELI the natural opponent
of FAwkEs. It is BENJAMIN v. GUY 1 The arrangements at Exeter
are not yet complete; but it is already known that MR. DISRAELI will
make a º: in the midst of the prepared fireworks. He
will then, with his own hand, ignite a rocket, a Catherine-wheel, and—
by way of irony—a Roman candle. The whole will conclude with a
blaze of fireworks, MR. DISRAELI appearing in the centre. “Coningsby,”
in variegated, lamps—indicative of the many-coloured genius of the
tº will be lighted at a flash above the head of the Protestant
Champion.
We owe it in justice to the committee to state, that the nominal
effigy of Guy FAwkes will in no feature, resemble the B-H-P 9F
Ex-T—R: and, further, that an unprincipled attempt to bribe the
rev-dd-gnitary's valet to sell a cast-off coat and apron of the revered
b—h—p was indignantly refused by that faithful servant. In fact, the
malice of the report is evident, from the circumstance that the man
had no such articles in his possession.
Fatal Effect of Sudden Joy.
GREAT tragic actors ought to reflect somewhat upon the probable
consequences ere they greatly condescend. It is well known that a
deputation of the bankers, merchants, fishmongers, tripe-boilers, and
others of the City of London supplicated MR. G W. Brooke to come
into the City and act. He consented, and what was the consequence P
A distinguished sausage-maker was so affected by joy at the event,
that he has been in a state of delirium ever since. Two keepers con-
stantly watch him. Fortunately the poor man's wife is able to attend
to the business. -
Ruins–You never saw a ruin without ivy—you never saw a ruined
man but he had a lawyer clinging round him.

DEPUTATIONS RECEIVED AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE
BY BENJAMIN DISRAELI, ESQ., M.P.
BEING the rewata quaestio of the
º the honourable gentleman
will receive, on Monday, a depu-
tation from the Beard and Mous-
tache Party, and listen to the
proposals that will then be made
1 to him to put himself at the
head and chin of the movement.
A large portrait of the talented
Ex-Chancellor has been painted,
in which he is represented with
a most magnificent beard and
flowing moustache. This por-
trait will be exhibited, and so
becoming and flattering is the
effect of it, that it is said MR.
Disraeli will then and, there
give his countenance to the ad-
vocacy of the Muntzian cause.
Intimation has been privately
sent to MR. MECHI to prepare
him for the worst.
On Tuesday, the Wegetarians
have obtained permission to
attend in a deputation upon him.
They bring with them a calm
prepared statement, that if MR.
DisrAELI will espouse their prin-
ciples, he will not save less than
£3 2s. 5d. a-year, that being
the difference between the price
of butcher's meat and vegetables;
*# and will also become healthier,
cleverer, wiser, and be able to
sleep sounder during LoRD DUDLEY STUART's speeches. It will likewise enable him
to stand with greater fortitude the late hours, and taunts, and sneers, and turmoils of
a Parliamentary life. His return to power (they hope to convince him) lies through
a kitchen-garden.
On Wednesday, it is to be the turn of the Cabmen. They want MR. DISRAELI
to get the new law repealed. If he will only declare himself a regular Hansom,
they engage to drive him back to Downing Street in less than no time, and to
charge #. nothing for the fare. -
On Thursday, several distinguished Mormonites have an appointment with Mr.
DisRAELI. They are anxious that he should give his consideration to the prin-
ciples of their sect, with the yiew of becoming one of them.
On Friday a deputation of citizens and merchants from the New Cut will have
the honour of waiting on MR. DisBAELI. It is their wish that he should try to
exert his influence with M.R. N. T. Hicks, for the Fº of dissuading that
e
gentleman from leaving the Victoria Theatre before as gone through a roundi.
of his most popular characters in the domestic and burglarious Drama.
On Saturday, MR. DISRAELI has promised to attend a meeting of Bonnet-
makers in Cranbourn Street. Having long noticed a gradual falling off in ladies'
bonnets, they are only fearful that the bonnet may fall off the head altogether, and
then what is to become of their trade? It is to avert this fall, that they are about
to implore of the Ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer to turn his head a little to
bonnets, in order to restore their proper equilibrium.
Besides the above, there are memoranda on MR. DISRAEL's table of deputations
from the Scotch grievance-mongers, from the Italian Brothers, from the
American female º who have been denied admission into the English
hospitals, from the Bloomers, the readers of the Morning Advertiser, and various
other persecuted classes and individuals, including of course all grades of Protec-
tionists. In the meantime, as MR. DisrAELI has generously stated that his time is
always at the service of any deputation that may require, his advice or assistance,
there is but little doubt that he will have plenty to do until Parliament opens. For
Parliament there is a recess, but for a DiskAELI none.
Lawks a Mercy!
THE name of the British chaplain still resident at St. Petersburg is the REVEREND
O. LAw! His name is naturally enough in the mouth of such ofi. fellow country-
men as are obliged to remain in Russia when they hear unfavourable news through
the Russian press, and as plenty of it is continually being fabricated, the reverend
gentleman under the denomination of oilºw'ſ is wante pretty frequently.
A Joke worthy of the Pillory.
By a new arrangement which the Post Office authorities are about to adopt, an
old saying will be rendered, obsºlete; for how can we talk about being “knocke
from pillar to post,” when the pillar and the post are in future to be identical?
THE DUE of THE DEAD.
IsIT beside my peaceful hearth,
With curtains drawn and lamp trimmed bright;
Iwatch my children's noisy, mirth;
I drink in home, and its delight.
Isip my tea, and criticise
#. '...". flying rumours caught;
Trace on the map, to curious eyes,
How here they marched, and there they fought.
In intervals of household chat,
I lay down strategetic laws;
Wy this manoeuvre, and why that;
Shape the event, or show the cause.
Or, in smooth dinner-table phrase,
Twixt soup and fish, discuss the fight;
Give to each chief his blame or praise;
Say who was wrong and who was right.
Meanwhile o'er Alma's bloody plain
The scathe of battle has rolled by—
The wounded writhe and groan—the slain
Lie naked staring to the sky.
The out-worn surgeon plies his knife,
Nor pauses with the closing day;
While those who have escaped with life
Find food and fuel as they may.
And when their eyes in sleep . close,
After scant rations duly shared,
Plague picks his victims out, from those
†. chance of battle may have spared.
Still when the bugle sounds the march,
He tracks his prey through º: and dell;
Hangs fruit to tempt the throats that parch,
And poisons every stream and well.
All this with gallant hearts is done;
All this with patient hearts is borne:
And they by whom the laurel's won
Are seldom they by whom 'tis worn.
No deed, no suffering of the war,
But wins us fame, or spares us ill;
Those noble swords, though drawn afar
Are guarding English homesteads still.
Own we a debt to these brave men,
Unpaid by aught that’s said or sung;
By leaders from a ready pen,
Or phrases from a flippant tongue.
The living, England's hand may crown
With recognition, frank and free;
With titles, medals, and renown;
The wounded shall our pensioners be.
But they, who meet a soldier's doom-
Think you, it is enough, good friend,
To plant the laurel at their tomb,
And carve their names—and there an end?
No. They are gone: but there are left
Those they loved best while they were here—
Parents made childless, babes bereft,
Desolate widows, sisters dear.
All these let grateful England take;
And, with a large and liberal heart,
Cherish, for her slain soldiers' sake,
And of her fulness give them part.
Fold them within her sheltering breast;
Their parent, husband, brother, prove.
That so the dead may be at rest,
Knowing those cared for whom they love.
Russian Military Habits.
In very many instances at Alma—the Russian officers
covered their uniforms with the gray great coats of the
common men. Thus they illustrated the old taunt, that
“the post of honour was a private station.”

, QUIET S T RE ETS.
(LANDLADIEs’ CIRCULAR.)
THE Season for taking lodgings in London having arrived, the
LANDLADIEs of the QUIET STREETs of the metropolis respectfully
submit the following programme of
vocal AND INSTRUMENTAL PERFORMANCEs,
which they have, by dint of toleration and encouragement, succeeded
in procuring for the benefit of ladies and gentlemen who may desire
quietness.
References to lodgers who have gone away, and who can testify to
the fidelity with which the whole .# these performances are regularly
given in the neighbourhoods in question, are kindly permitted. Inquiries
may also be made at Bethlehem Hospital, . }. Asylum, of
§: of those establishments who have removed thither from Quiet
reets.
To invalids, to persons possessing nerves, to clergymen and others
desirous of study, to authors, to musicians, and to all who deem
uietness, at certain hours at least, one of the necessaries of life, the
§. Streets offer advantages not to be found elsewhere.
PROGRAMME
or
PERFORMANCES IN THE QUIET STREETS OF LONDON.
MoRNING.
Sir. Sweeps, who will knock loudly until seven, varying their per-
formances by whistling, by invocations to the blessed housemaid MARY,
and by rattling their
brushes along the rails of
the areas of the house to
which they come, and of
its immediate neighbours.
The following cries will
then begin, and each will
be continued up and down
the street until , the per-
former is relieved by his or
her successor:—
Seven. First Milkman
with ioud shouts" of
“Mielaw l’”
Half-past Seven. Second
Milkman, with loud shouts
of “Low-eu!” .
Quarter to Eight. Third Milkman, with great rattling of pails, and
a prolonged shriek, “New Milk, twopence a kvort!”
Eight. Hoarse young Girl: “Any Water-cree-ee-ee-ee-ses.”.”
Halfpast Eight. Hoarse old Man: “Fine Water-cree-ses!”
Nine. “Hearthstones!” -
Half-past Nine. “Dust, ho!” “Any Chairs to Mend?”
Ten. “Pa-per! Pa-per! Pa-per! . .
gº!?" Ten. First Organ. Morning Hymn — Pop Goes the
caseſ.
Eleven. Two Costermongers who purposely bawl at the same time,
“Wegetables! Taturs!
Turnips.”, (The great
effect of the morning—
in fact a sensation.)
Halfpast Eleven. He-
brew melody, “Any O
Clof" Grunt accom-
paniment.
Twelve. All the boys
come home from school,
and are sent to play for
an hour in the Quiet
Streets that they may
not be run over. Gym-
nastics—leap-frog–pu-
gilism—quarrels.
Halfpast Twelve. Se-
cond Organ: Love Not—Willikins.
AFTERNOON.
One. Cat's Meat. Also Rabbits. Also, Images.,. - -
Halfpast One. Knife-grinder—very deliberate artist—with pleasing
accompaniment on grindstone-fireworks.
Tuco. “Any Umbrellas to mend?” The Three Furious Milkmen again.
Half-past Two. Third Organ: Rule Britannia–Polkas.
Three. Flower-show. Loud lecture: “All a blowin', all a growin', a
penny, a pot, ladies, a penny a pot, ladies—a penny a pot flow—ers!”
Half-past Three. The sailor who received the immortal.NELson in
his arms at Trafalgar; with tracts to sell. Pious song, “Your art’s
uncommon stony, But still there's opes, for
you.” This performer is irascible and slightly
abusive if an unprotected female looks at him
and does not give him money.
Four. “Grunsle for your birds — now then—
grunsle—grunsle! Grunsle for the dicky, for the
poor little dicky, grunsle!”
Halfpast Four. Fourth Organ: Partant pour
la Syrie—Jolly Nose.
Five. “Fly-papers | Fly-papers . . Here’s
somefin to catch the nasty flies wot bites the
little babies' eyes. Fly-papers' "
Half-past Five. “Muffins—muffins !” Mass
bell accompaniment.
Evening.
Sir. “Walnuts, fine new walnuts!” Usually
a trio.
Half-past Sir. Fifth Organ : Evening Hymn
—Drinking Chorus from Robert le Diable. , . . -
Seven. Boys having had their tea, and it is hoped learned their
lessons, are turned out for an hour's, wholesome play before dark.
Performance as at twelve, but much noisier.
Halfpast Seven. Sixth Organ. Band instrument, drawn by a horse
and worked by two men. º: roaring of this instrument may be hear
many streets off, and so far as mechanical inventions may be.com-
pared to the coſt humana, the effect equals that of the eleven o'clock
performance.)
NIGHT.
ight to Ten. Miscellaneous. If the night be fine, the boys howl
at the passengers, and sing defiant ballads. If wet, children are
turned out, with very few clothes, to sing in a very high voice, and
to whine to the basement story. Hurdygurdies, and other instruments
are also heard, and a German band plays at the public-house at the
corner. But arrangements have been made for the performances tº
conclude about ten o'clock. It should, however, be added, that all
cabs in a hurry take the Quiet Streets during most 'hours of the night,
and therefore the depressing stillness so fatal to health and intellect, is
avoided until, at six o'clock, the round of performances is renewed.

SOMETHING RADICALLY WHONG.
THE following is from an Australian paper:—
THE party who stole a root from my garden and dropped a nugget, is
informed that there are more plants left. W. LAw, Seedsman, 187, Little Collin
Street East.
We have been taught that we should “set a thief to catch a thief,”
but it would appear from the above, that in order to catch a thief we
should sometimes set a cabbage or some other member of the vegetable
kingdom. We are not told what root it was that the thief took away,
but he made ample amends if he left behind him a carat of gold in
exchange for a carrot of a more humble material. We are not sur-
prised at the invitation to the “party” to come again, on the same
terms, though he will probably absent himself for the future from a
º iroots, where he has found one that has proved to him a root

THIEVES ºr WANTED.”
..WE wonder that we do not see among the curiosities of advertising
literature such an advertisement as the following :
W ANTED, by a Wholesale House in the City, an active young Man,
as Collector, who will actively collect his employer's money (and appropriate it
to his own purposes). He must be a good walker (and well able to walk off with the
fruits of his labours). Salary (nominally) £50 a year (but as it is quite obvious that
he cannot support himself, with possibly a wife and family, on this sum, he will
naturally be disposed to make up any deficiency from the funds with which he will be
confidentially entrusted).
The above advertisement may seem somewhat unusual, but the
following, which appeared in the Times of the 14th of October, if inter-
preted by the ordinary rules of common sense, can scarcely be supposed
to differ from that which we have imagined.
LERK.—WANTED, by a Wholesale House in the City, a respectable,
active, young Man, age not to exceed 25, as COLLECTOR, and to make himself
generally useful in the counting-house; must be a good walker. Apply by letter, in
own handwriting, stating previous employment, references, capabilities, &c., age, and
height, to, &c. &c. Salary E50 per annum.
We cannot suppose that the “wholesale house” putting forth, the
above advertisement can expect to obtain a “collector,” a general clerk,
and a porter (for he is to be “generally useful,” and to be “a good
walker,” unless he is to collect for himself, to be useful to himself, and
to walk, off when detection seems imminent. If , the “wholesale
house” had other intentions, the advertisement would not have con-
cluded with the significant words, “Salary, £50 per annum.”
THE STAR SQUABBLE.
(AT PRESENT AGITATING ASTRONoMICAL AND ASTROLOGICAL sociFTY.)
SAYS BREwsTER to WHEwell, let’s fight a star duel,
Though you’re very cruel to raise such a strife.
What! Nature make worlds for mere lanterns, or fuel?
I tell you all planets are swarming with life.
sº WHEwell to BREwsTER, you old Cock, or Rooster,
hy will you anew stir the question with me?
Excepting our planet, Creation's whole cluster
’S as empty as you and your volume, Sir D.
Says BREwsTER to WHEwBDL, you’ve just got your gruel,
o, MR. PROFEssoR, you’d best sleep upon it.
Says WHEwell to DAVID, go get your head shaved,
mless you’re afraid of the bees in your bonnet.
THE PIANOFORTE AND THE DAIRY.
MR. Corvile, Member for South Derbyshire, at the Sparkenhoe
Farmers' Club Dinner, ventured to observe that he thought “the
Farmers' wives above their business.”—“The pianoforte would not
harmonise with a good dairy of cheese.” On this MR. Colvile was
blown by a burst of indignation almost off his legs; as, ten to one, he
will at the next election be blown clean out of his seat. MR Colville,
as a peace-offering, then flung himself upon the poultry; “it was highly
creditable to the ladies.” It would not do—the ladies would not be
mollified. Dropping the poultry, MR. Colville next suggested that
there should be, to the honour of the mothers, a baby show: we
showed heifers, “why not infants?” This liberal suggestion was
hooted, screeched at ; and Colvile became wan and crest-fallen.
he said was a joke—a mere joke. After a time, the meeting professed
to be satisfied with the explanation; but it was clear—after the de-
parture of Colville—that his words rankled. “This comes of making
a man a Member of Parliament. He will tell his mind; he gets such
a habit of straightforwardness in the House of Commons.” It is
thought that MR. Colvile will consider it as only due to himself to
make a written answer to this aspersion.
An Attack not Easily Repelled.
THE EMPEROR NICHOLAs, it is said, is overcome with the deepest
melancholy—and, to make melancholy matters worse, our brave, Allies
in the Crimea are likely soon to prove to him that it is no such easy
matter to drive away the Blues.
EPIGRAM BY SIR CHARLEs."NAPIER."
We’ve taken Bomarsund; non constat
That we could also have taken Cronstadt.
NIGHTINGALES FOR THE EAST –We are about to send some dear
Nightingales to nurse our sick soldiers. Punch would not much wonder
if some of the Nightingales, in due time, became Ring-doves.
. THE PILL AND DRAUGHT MARKET.
| EDICINE is evidently look-
ing down, and Physicis be-
coming adrug in themarket.
In proof of this statement
we subjoin quotations from
the advertising column of a
contemporary. From the
first of these it will be seen
that professional gentlemen
are inquired for at an ex-
tremely low figure:–
EDICAL. – WANTED,
immediately, by a Surgeon,
residing a few miles from town, a
GENTLEMAN, to visit, dis-
pense, and attend Midwifery.
Salary, £40 per annum, with
board and residence. Apply
&c. &c.
By the next, it appears
that the demand for assist-
ants is not limited to
medical gentlemen, but may
be sufficiently answered by
Surgery boys.
W ANTED, by a Surgeon
of limited practice, a
YOUTH, about 18, with some
knowledge of dispensing, to assist in the Surgery and take out the medicine. For
address apply to Windson, Bottle Merchant, Bartholomew Close.
The former of these announcements º us with data from
which a tolerably safe estimate may be made of the extent and value
of the advertiser's business. That the practice is a large one may be
inferred from the fact that the services of an assistant,are required in
all its branches, but the amount of remuneration offered for the accept:
ance of candidates is an indication of small profits, which, taking all
circumstances into consideration, we should be disposed to put down at
from iºd, to 2d. per visit, for medicine and attendance, over and above
the cost price of the articles supplied. The nature of the board, and
residence which are promised the assistant in addition to something
less than 15s. 5d. a week, is not stated. Of course no exception can
be made to these terms; the wages of medical labour, like, those of
any other labour, must be regulated by the laws of º and demand.
It must, however, be considered absurd to advertise for a, Gentleman,
when the proffered hire is such that a Journeyman, unless he be a very
unskilled one, would turn up his nose at it. -
The remuneration, to be received by the Youth who is wanted to
dispense the medicine and also carry it out, is not specified. We
suspect, too, that the duties which he is expected to perform, are more

round the physic to the limited number of patients, constituting his
|master's practice, we apprehend that he would be employed in cleaning
boots, knives, and forks; and also have to officiate in the stable, should
the limited practice increase so as to necessitate the keeping of a horse.
We must confess, however, that we hope no such extension of its
limits may take place: since amongst a multitude of patients, whose
medicines are compounded by an errand-boy, some awkward mistakes
might happen. Possessing some knowledge of dispensing, but perhaps
not quite enough, the Youth might. F. up corrosive sublimate for

One thing is quite clear: that if medical assistants are paid at the
rate of common mechanics, and engaged to perform the services of
|pages and tigers, we shall soon have our prescriptions dispensed by

will call round for orders, in brown paper caps and fustian jackets, or
without any jackets at all, and in mere waistcoats and shirt-sleeves.

THE GLUT OF GREAT CREATURES.
. It is delightful to see the daily string of Theatrical Advertisements
in the Times, announcing the important fact of the whereabouts of
those great luminaries of the stage, who, though leaving London in
darkness, are pleased to shine with terrific glare in the Provinces.
Numerous as these announcements have been, we can assure our
readers that circumstances alone prevent the appearance of at least
half a hundred additional advertisements every day from those geniuses
who are desirous of letting the world know what they are about, and
how much the Metropolis is missing in the way of amusement by their
absence from London. We subjoin a few specimens:—
MI; STENTOR, the distinguished hippo-tragedian, whose impressive
horseback impersonations have created the greatest sensation ever known in any
sawdust, will appear as Mazeppa, at Greenwich Fair on Easter Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday, and at Charlton near Woolwich in the summer of 1855; and on Whit

PUBLIC NUISANCE IN DOWNING STREET.
MR. PUNCH and a full bench of Contributors were occupied for some
hours at the No-Quarter Sessions, in hearing a complaint against a
very respectable looking old Scotch lady, who was understood to be
a native of Aberdeen, and who was charged, as the owner of certain
premises in Downing Street, with keeping a place so as to be a
Inulsance.
MR. INSPECTOR SHALLABALLA was the first Witness called. He said
he was occupied in looking after the healthy condition of the neigh-
bourhood of Downing Street, and finding the place occupied by the
Defendant to have got into very bad odour, he had visited the spot and
found a great accumulation of various matters, which caused a stagna-
tion, which, he, the Inspector, thought was very injurious to the
healthy condition of the public. He would, however, with Mr. Punch's
ermission, bring forward a very important Witness, who could give
ull particulars. He would call LoRD Pomic Eston E.
LoRD PowiçEstone deposed that he had long known the neighbour-
hood of Downing Street, and that he had lived on and off the premises
for a series of years. He had sometimes been obliged to leave the place
of his own accord, on account either of obnoxious businesses that were
being carried on, or of some stagnation or other which, prevented
matters of various kinds from flowing in a free channel, and the place
had thus, got, from time to time, into bad odour. He knew the
Defendant, whom he believed to be a very worthy well-meaning person
but very slow in adopting any improvement. He, the Witness, live
with Defendant as a neighbour, on pretty good terms, though, he con-
ſessed he had sometimes lost his patience, and put himself out, but then
he could soon put himself in again. (A laugh.)
MR.PUNCH asked the Witness if he could give any information as to
the subject of the present complaint.
LoRD POMICESTONE said that he certainly could say a good deal on
the subject, though he had no wish to do anything unneighbourly
towards the Defendant, who was a good old creature in her way, but
when in other people's way was rather objectionable. (A laugh.) The
Witness then proceeded to state that since he had been in Downing
Street, lately he had observedyarious disagreeable effects from the place
occupied by the Defendant. There was a sort of something which he
could only compare to a kind of Scotch mist, which threw a damp on
everything, and imparted a disagreeable languor to everybody employed
on the premises.
MR. PUNCH remarked that the Witness did not seem to be affected
by it, for he seemed strong and hearty, and was understood to get
through a great deal of business;
LoRD Powicestone admitted that was true, but he added that he
worked in a different part of the premises from that occupied by the
Defendant, but he had nevertheless felt at times the influence of the
damp he had spoken of, which could be compared in its consequences |
to nothing but the vapours. In fact, continued the Witness, it is well
known that I have left my place more than once, and have only been
: * again by a promise that what I complained of should be
remedled.
MR. PUNCH inquired if the Defendant had any answer to make to
the complaint.
The Defendant, a most respectable-looking old party, here stood
forward, and said that the place agreed very well with her. She had
herself nothing to complain of, and she thought people had better mind
their own business instead of *::::: all this fuss about nothing. If
people chose to poke their noses into places where they had no business,
they could not complain if they found things not exactly as they liked.
Several witnesses spoke to the excellent character of the Defendant, but
MR. PUNCH remarked that this was not a case in which character
was concerned. Public improvements must not be stopped, an
nuisances suffered to exist, because the character of the party might be
unexceptionable. There was a nuisance proved to exist, with a con-
siderable amount of stagnation, affecting the whole atmosphere of the
place, and throwing a damp on every thing in the neighbourhood. He
should therefore order the place to be emptied and filled up in a com-
plete and effective manner. -
The Defendant said it would be useless to empty it, for it could not
be better filled than it was at £iº - - -
LoRD Powicestone remarked that he would undertake to fill it in a
satisfactory manner, if the place was only once properly emptied.
DEFENDANT. You had better try.
... LoRD Powicestone. No, no! Let’s have it emptied, first, and then
if nobody else will fill it, I will, if I can be allowed to do things in my
OWm Way.
MR. Fuscº declared this conversation irregular, and the parties left
the Court.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CZAR’S FORGE.
great way, and sometimes bri
us back intelligence come-
by no other party’s “Own Corre-
spondent.” By the aid of this
little bird of ours we are enabled
to take a bird’s-eye view of the
- interior of one of the most im-
portant manufactories in Russia; that is to say the limperial Forge at
St. Petersburg. Here, the practical, no less than the poetical j will
naturally surmise, are forged the thunderbolts of war. Bombs, cannon
balls, rockets, however, are not the description of articles produced at
this establishment. Yet the weapons fabricated at the St. Petersburg
Forge are almost, if not quite, as telling, in general warfare, as any of
those missiles; instead of being round shot they are, in two plain and
simple words, round lies. Made up in the form of bulletins, they do
a service for their author, which often, to a great extent, cºmpensates
for the shortcomings of his bullets. Let us use our littlé bird's eye as
the lens of a ºf: and take a look through it at the internal
arrangements and economy of this interesting workshop, whence the
whole Russian empire derives its principal supply of the commodity
which is necessary to its political existence; to wit, in Oriental
phraseology, the thing which is not.
The room, of which we are surveying the interior, does not look
much like a blacksmith's shop. There is too much carving and gilding
about it; too many statues—of nude VENUSEs, many of them—too
large a number of malachite vases in it for it in any measure to resemble
that humble species of manufactory. There are a few more books also
and maps therein, than would probably be found in the best furnished
apartment of eyen, a master iron-founder. It is, in fact, a library.
ou see no fire in this forge; that is in the stove; no bellows; and no
anvils except tables, whereon lie inkstands, pens, quantities of paper,
and copies of the Times, Moniteur, Punch, and all the leading journals
of Europe. These periodicals, º; correct news and truthful
comments, form the raw materials, which are to be worked up into
masses of quite a different looking substance for distribution.
At each table sits a workman engaged in operating on the supply of
facts before him. We remark that several of these labourers are
decorated with ribbons and crosses: these are princes and other noble-
men, of high civil and military rank. But our attention has been more
particularly attracted by a tall stout personage, in a blue uniform and
jack boots, who sits at a larger and handsomer table than the others,
with despatches before him as well as newspapers, and whose chair is
surmounted with the carved image of a nondescript of the feathered
race, apparently meant for the Black Swan with Two Necks: only the
bill is crooked, and the creature has a crown on either head, so that we
understood it to represent the Russian eagle. This gentleman is
MR. Nicholas Romanory, the proprietor of the establishment. You
are struck with a singularly mild expression in his eyes; a tiger's
physiognomy is considered amiable by some people. Be thankful that
you are not struck, nor ever likely to be, if we can help it, with the
knout of which your mental vision may discern the thong hanging
out of this gentleman's pocket. You observe that he wears a large
silver cross at his breast; yes, MR. Romanoff is very devout, in the
orthodox Russo-Greek way, and sanctifies all his operations of business,
especially his transactions, in wholesale murder and robbery, by con-
necting them with that holy symbol. And now MR. Romanoff, with
his gross on his heart, is engaged in the hallowed work of his Forge:
for Nicholas Romanoff is not so proud as to be above his trade.
E have a little bird that flies a
Now you see a workman, evidently somebody of rank, perhaps one
of MR. RoMANoFF's own sons; can it be MR. CossTANTINE RomanorF,
alias the GRAND DUKE CoNstANTINE 2 No; it is PRINCE Polishoff:
uitting his desk, he walks up to MR. RoMANOFF, Senior, with a sheet of
oolscap. ; like a schoolboy showing up his sum. The task which he
in fact does show up is a piece of intelligence which has been allotted
to him for alteration and embellishment. ! we perceive it is a
version of the battle of Alma, in which two-thirds of the French and
English are declared to iºn killed, half of the other third to have
been taken prisoners, and the remainder to have run away and fled
before the face of MENscHIKorf, whose signature is appended to the
document. See; MR. Roxa NoFF, senior, is looking over the perform-
ance. Now he nods and smiles with approbation; a fact has been
exactly and adroitly falsified; now he frowns and dashes his pen
through a word: it is a blunder expressing a truth. On the whole he
is pleased: and, dismissing the author, sends the manuscript by an
attendant to be set up in a neighbouring apartment wherein there is
a printing-press, worked by a gang of pressmen from the office of the
Invalide Russe. In a few moments the proof is returned to him for
correction. First, he holds it out at arm’s length, in a front aspect
and then takes an oblique view of it from either side with a right and
left inclination of the head. He grins a little, and we seem to hear
him chuckle. Yes; he thinks that will do, and having had the errata
in it amended, sticks it against the and retiring a pace or two
indulges in a final gaze at its general effect, which is that of the most
wonderful deception ever practised or exhibited. By means of fabrica-
tions of this sort, MR. RomanorF is enabled to drive a roaring trade;
for they are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of his public, and he,
for his own part, does not care, so long as his public enables him to
carry on the War.
A GOOD BLOW-OUT FOR BARRISTERS.
AMONG the great Reforms contemplated by the Inns of Court is an
alteration in the price of the dinners, which is to be henceforth two-
and-sixpence. . As the dinners are at present the only qualification for
a member of the Bar, we would throw out the suggestion, that by way
of popularising the profession, authority might be granted to a number
of respectable eating-house keepers, to confer the degree of barrister
on those who may have eaten and paid for a certain stipulated number
of dinners at a certain price, to be hereafter agreed upon. We would
propose that the dinner bills, regularly receipted, should be sufficient
evidence of the dinners having been eaten, and paid for.
As we are enemies to all monopoly, we cannot see why the mere
consumption of thirty-six dinners at half-a-crown each should entitle
the consumer to be called to the Bar if the dinners happen to have
been eaten in an Inn of Court; while the same amount of dinners
eaten and paid for at the Wellington, or Simpson's, or even at a de-
cently-conducted “slap-bang?” confer on the consumer no professional
standing whatever. e never could precisely understand the principle
on which dinner-eating is º a necessary qualification for a
barrister; but it has just occurred to us, that the achievement may be
a sort of guarantee that the power of jaw is satisfactory.
SINOPE REMEMBERED.
WHERE shall I be this time twelvemonths? is a wholesome thought
for all of us. It might have occurred to ADMIRAL KoRNILorf a year
ago, whilst he was doing the work of his master at Sinope, for which
he now lies paid at Sebastopol. Does, it ever occur to Nicholas
Does this wicked old man ever reflect that after a lapse of a determi-
nate number of seconds, few or many, his, Imperial, person will be a
mass of carrion, or a mummy?, Then, for all the bloodshed and misery
with which he has afflicted mankind, how much the better will he be?--
how much the worse? Is this last a question ever propounded by this
obstinate old savage to himself, in occasional intermissions of his
habitual ferocity.” We trust such may be the case. , Nicho!.As is our
enemy; but we hope he may some day think seriously, and experience
a change, as they say at Exeter #. We also hope SAwNEY BEAN
did, and THURTELL, and GREENACRE, and RUSH, before they came to
be hanged.
A Nice Name.
DR. RAE mentions that he was accompanied, in the Arctic Regions
by an Esquimaux interpreter named WILLIAM OUGLIBUck. We shoul
#: to know if that is the individual's real name. Very likely he, so
pronounces it and spells it so too, if he can spell; but considering what
is the Esquimaux t of countenance, we doubt if that is the exact
appellation by which MR. OUGLIBUck was christened. We suspect
that he was indebted for that very suggestive distinction to some spon-
sorial midshipman, of a facetious turn, who not only gaye him the name
of WILLIAM, but added the more characteristic denomination of
UGLYBUCK.

PHILOSOPHICAL DRAMA.
OUR readers need not be alarmed. We are not going into a disqui;
sition concerning the “Stage in Germany”—a subject which so alarmed
the editors of the Antijacobin some years ago. . We wish merely to
offer a few suggestions with reference to some advertisements we met
with lately. It seems that the proprietors of the Polytechnic and
Panopticon are about to introduce dramatic readings and singsongs as
part of their attractions—there can be no objection we should think to
this. To unite the utile cum dulci has long been the wish of right-
minded educationists, and there seems to be no reason why the crucible
cum dulcimer should not be engaged in furtherance of scientific
education. -
That SHAKESPEARE knew anything of the Atomic theory, of the
diffusion of gases, or of compound radicals, we may be permitted to
doubt; but a general notion of chemical laws he must have had. I
allusion to the possibility of the dust of Apex ANDER ultimately stopping
a beer barrel is sufficient proof that he understood, all about the
indestructibility of matter, while the familiar mannerin which Touchstone
speaks of the retort “courteous” shows on the º of the author an
acquaintance with chemical apparatus. But we do not intend to go
into the question “did SHAKESPEARE understand º ?” weleave
that to Mr. CHARLEs KNIGHT, who can no doubt make the subject as
clear as day. We merely wish, as we said before, to offer a few sugges-
tions which we hope the proprietor of the Polytechnic will not think
us precipitate in making at this early stage of the chemical drama
ation. We would respectfully hint that instead of º old
ys, new ones should be written and read—the plots laid in the labo-
ratory; and scenes of thrilling interest might easily be got up with the
voltaic battery: the titles must be appropriate and taking. For instance,
Margarite of Glycerine would be, as they sayin the transpontine districts,
a stunner; and if “written up to" with a º on the amusement
and instruction plan, would be sure to take. . PEPPER might make
the reading of various compounds quitesimple, and if he could not reach
the sublime, might at least achieve a sublimate. With passing remarks
on the organic compounds, with an accompaniment on the ". together
with allusion to the connection between the treble and bass, and the
tribasic phosphates, the thing would be sure, tº go off well. Even a
*screaming” effect might be produced, whenladies are present, by the
judicious introductionofafew explosions—“as part of the performance,”
as Jack said. -
“The reduced Oxide, or Idon't care a Button,” would be a good title
for either farce or tragedy; and with a few well-seasoned remarks from
Mr. Pepper, a good audience could not fail to be mustered.
The Prince of Wales a Sailor.
The young Prince, it is said, is about to enter the º and will
take rank as lieutenant on board, the line-of-battle ship the Albert,
christened after papa. His Royal Highness, it is said, is most impatient
to be thefore Chanues N's tragedy, at Windsor sets in with
its usual severity. We do not vouch for the accuracy of the statement,
but are bound to give it as one very current at the clubs.
THE LORD MAYOR'S SHOW.
THE Mayoralty of Moon has been long looked for by those who
have kept their eyes on the course of that great Civic Luminary, which
originally rose from behind the shadow of a small counter in the city,
and has at length reached its full in the vaulted dome of the Mansion
|House. Expectation has been not only on tip-toe, but has seized the
stilts of imagination for the º: of raising itself to the utmost
height, with a view to the forthcoming Lord MAYon's Show, which it
is supposed will be characteristic of the great lunar phenomenon that
is to shine during the ensuing year in the City of London,
In the first place it is suggested that the streets should be converted
into a novel kind of milkyway, by laying down chalk instead of gravel
in the thoroughfares º: the procession will pass, and the figures
of Gog and Magog will bes ded by those of ORIon wearing his
belt, and the Great Bear wearing his collar. The state coach will, it is
hoped, be broken up for distribution in slices of gilt º among
the children of the poor, while the Loºp MAYor takes, his seat in
|CHARLEs’s Wain, a conveyance worthy of the Great Moon's dignity.
Instead of the old unmeaning mace, which with every jolt of the
vehicle, has endangered the windows of the state-coach, or the head of
the Mayor, it is proposed that the Remembrancer shall carry a large
stick of Lunar Caustic, while the banner of his Lordship shall be an
Almanack, to tell the Moon's age—a piece of information which, during
the ensuing year, will possess unusual interest.
The national air of the city for the next twelvemonths will be “Rise,
Gentle Moon,” and the favourite air of “The Young May Moon is
Beaming” will be played in compliment to the juvenile members of the
Civico-royal º, -
It is expected that the populationwill be thoroughly “Moonstruck”
on the ninth of November, and the City Treasurer will be instructed
to be prepared with the Moon's first quarter at the usual period.
Perhaps the most º of the exhibition on Lord Mayor’s
day will be the effect of Moon-light on the water, when the Lord
MAYor smiles on the Thames with the radi of his silver coun-
tenance. We trust there will be many. Moon-light nights of Mayoral
hospitality at the Mansion House, and we have no doubt that instead
of being the subject of an eclipse, the Civic Moon will eclipse most of
those lesser luminaries who have twinkled heretofore in the vaulted
dome of Cockneydom.
A SCHOOLBOY'S SONG OF THE WAR.
Evil possessed one man, Nicholas Romanorr,
Projects for robbing the Sultan to lay,
Evil possessed one man: that’s how the war began,
So the proud Tyrant went canting away.
He made of his cross a sword; Nicholas Romanorr,
Scandalous, shocking, and shameful to say!
He made himself a sword of the cross he adored,
So the proud Tyrant went canting away.
Of the Bible he made a sham; Nicholas Romanoff
Quoted texts—as we know the old gentleman may.
Of the Bible he made a sham-fanatic serfs to bam,
So the proud Tyrant went canting away.
Of the swindle he made a mess; Nicholas Row ANoFF,
Foiled in the trick he intended to play,
Of the swindle he made a mess; yet, in his wickedness,
Still the proud Tyrant goes canting away.
Controversy in the Crimea.
WE are glad to notice a new feature in theological controversy.
Clergymen of various denominations are going out to the Crimea as
eacefully together as the owls and the guinea-pigs in the happy
}. heir design is to contend with each other to the utmost in
the instruction of the troops and the consolation of the sick and
wounded; and as they all doubtless mean well, and probably mean the
same thing, we wish them all success.
The Tailor Non-suited.
THE great paletot interest has failed at Frome, and MR. Don ALD
NicoLL has been returned, or rather sent back, by the electors, whose
suffrages he solicited. Perhaps if the ex-sheriff had resorted to bribery,
and promised a wrap-rascal to every rascal who would sell his vote, the
result might have been otherwise, “Measures, not men,” is an old
political cry, but in this instance the issue has proved that some men
|may be rejected, though their “measures” may be unimpeachable.

.. EVENING PARTY AT SEBASTOPOL.
HINTS ON BABY SHOWS.
AſCINCINNATI newspaper, describing the Baby Show, which was held
lately in Clark County, Ohio, remarks that in that interesting exhibition
large and fat infants predominated, and states the weight of two of
those innocents, aged 4 and 5 months respectively, as 20 and 274tb.
Should the American notion of prize babies be taken up in this country,
we hope that too much of a point will not be made of fat, in this
description of stock. . The fat cattle show, when the obesity of the
animals is excessive, is in great part but an exposition of materials for
the melting pot; but a mere fat Baby Show would not amount even to
that, and as it would be in no measure useful, so neither would it be
ornamental in the least degree. Tombstone angels, indeed, and stone-
masons' Cupids, are models of a .. which it is unpleasant to
contemplate in mere stone, and would present a still more disagreeable
appearance as wheezing and puffing masses of actual blubber. If it is
distressing to witness the respiratory labours of a hypertrophied pig,
how much more painful a spectacle of imminent suffocation must be
afforded by the babe half stified with plethora!
We would therefore suggest that in the award of prizes, the absolute
weight of a child should not alone be considered, but that regard should
also be had to its specific gravity. For an infant consisting principally
of fat might, as a mere lump, outweigh another infant of smaller size
but of greater density, having its bone and muscle in a more forward
state of development. To find the specific gravity of any body, you
divide the weight of that body by the weight of an equal bulk of water.
The specific gravity of a baby would be readily ascertained by plunging
it gently into a tub quite full of water over head and ears, collecting
the water that ran over, weighing it, and † the positive weight
of the child by the weight of the quantity of water so displaced.
Water at 60 degrees of FAHRENHEIT is the standard for determining the
specific gravity of ordinary bodies, but in the case of a baby, a rather
higher temperature would be advisable: and then, the process would
amount to no more than putting it into a warm bath, and giving a
salubrious and comfortable ducking to a little duck.
Not crying, and freedom from catarrhal symptoms, as indicated by the
nose, we would also recommend as qualities and merits to be specially
taken into account in adjudicating on the claims of the infantile com-
petitors: and we would propose that a special #. should be awarded
to the baby that makes itself least frequently disagreeable to its male
parent. In the event of a Baby Show being held at Baker Street Bazaar,
or elsewhere in England, we also hope that a mistaken vanity will not
dress the sucklings up in caps, which, in-doors, can only heat the brain,
and lay the foundation of fits and derangement of mind, whilst we trust
on the other hand, that the limbs will be well and warmly clothed, an
not left naked to attract admiration, catch cold, and acquire a tendency
to consumption and serofula. A tea service and salver, of silver, or
even of gold, should also be allotted for the largest family of children
reared without sucking-pig, or recourse to DAFFY. . By the way our
Cincinnati contemporary does not say whether or no “Mrs. Johnson"
was much in request at the American Baby Show.

LIVERPOOL ORANGES.
THE Orangemen of Liverpool have sent in an address to Lond ENNIs-
KILLEN on the late railway horror. In this address, they meekly observe
to his Lordship that he may (with, doubtless, great self-consolation)
sing the following sweetly soothing lines:—
- “We'll bear, we'll hold the Orange name,
Though hell oppose and earth deride;
We'll keep the faith through fear and shame,
That faith for which our fathers died."
LORD ENNISKILLEN makes affectionate reply: the above, he says, is
a lovely evidence, “of true, loyalty and sound religious truth.” He
then proceeds to denounce the Catholic religion as a creed that “brings
forth such fruits” as the late atrocity. This is very Christian-like.
Now we should be sorry, indeed, were the Protestant faith to be judged
by such fruits as the Liverpool Oranges, things at once very green and
very bitter. But LoRD ENNISKILLEN pities the Catholics; and to show
his feeling for them, he compassionately—spits in their faces.

GREAT GRATUITOUS BREWERS.
(To JUSTU's LIEBIG.)
CIENTIFIC SIR,--I believe you are
partial to ALLsoPE's Pale Ale
and also that you have analysed
that beverage.
You will therefore be sorry
to hear that I have had a cir-
cular sent me, signed SAMUEL
ALLSOPP AND SONs, announcing
that those gentlemen have come
to the decision to make an ad-
vance of 6s. P. barrel upon
their ales of all qualities... You
will likewise be in a position to
inform me whether or not this
augmentation was necessary: at
least in regard to pale ale.
In addition to the increased
malt duty, “the almost total
the reason for raising their ales.
Supposing the necessity for that
step to exist, I am glad to find
that it is occasioned by these
circumstances.
The specific value of a glass of pale ale consists, I believe, scientific
Sir, almost entirely (cost of production exce ted) in the alcohol and
bitter extract which it contains; and in the bitter much rather than
in the spirituous ingredient... Now, can you tell me what are the
quantities, respectively, of malt and hops represented by the strength
and the bitterness of a glass of pale ale? Because I should like to know
how many pennyworths of hops and of malt I consume in swallowing a
pint of that fluid. So much, MESSRs. ALLsopp say, that, the advance
which has been made by them “will still leave” them “without any
margin for profit.” At that rate, they have been ºil. ale away
now for some time, and intend continuing to supply us therewith gratis.
Nothing can be more liberal than this: and pale ale, offered at these
terms, becomes a truly generous liquor. To you, however, I look for
those data, whereby alone I can be enabled to appreciate its generosity.
Pray illuminate on that point your respectful admirer,
38°552C1A.
P.S.. I have heard it remarked by Law Students (from the country)
that MR. JUSTU's LIEBIG ought to be a jolly good judge of beer.
THE GOVERNMENT EXAMINERS.
IT appears that the Examinations to which Candidates for Govern-
ment Situations are now subjected, have proved dreadful stumbling
blocks to numerous young gentlemen, who felt an honourable ambition
to receive the public money quarterly. We learn that out of some
250 of these aspirants, only 30, could acquit themselves respectabl
before the Examiners. It must be admitted, however, that the ord
is dreadfully severe, and a young man must devote himself to many
years of intense study before he has a chance of passing. We shudder
to think of what he is required to do. The tests are threefold.
He must,
First. Write a common business note, on a given subject.
Secondly, Evince a knowledge of the first rules of arithmetic.
Thirdly. Take down a passage from some standard English author,
from dictation.
No wonder that in the presence of such requirements 220 young
gentlemen broke down, and we hear that out of the 30 who succeede
in passing through the frightful trial 25, have since been laid up by
their exertions and the excitement; three have been interdicted by their
doctors from reading anything heavier than SIR ARCHIRALD ALISQN even
if they can find it, and the other two have resigned their salaries an
been superannuated. We hope that official pedantry will not be per-
mitted to pursue this inhuman system longer, but that the sons of
our influential classes will once more, as heretofore, be admitted to the
situations to which their birth entitles them, without submitting to
this ruinous and tyrannical treatment. We bave had a batch of the
Examination Papers sent to us, and as one fact is better than a thou-
sand arguments, we shall strengthen the case of these oppressed
º a thousand fold, by printing the result, in one case. The
etails may excite a smile on the lip of the heartless, but certain, we
are that no hater of oppression, no person with his heart in the right
place, no loather of tyranny will read them without a burning blush
upon his brow to think that in the nineteenth century, &c. &c.

call him dear, smeared the note, and demanded another sheet.)
“SIR, or BugGINs” (“Perhaps that’s better. Another sheet, old
fellow”).
“BugGINs-You must be a fool to think I am going to submit to

and what he says is right l’ll abide by, but confound your cheating.
“Pimlico, Tuesday.” “Yours, &c., A. C. F. W. B.”
“I suppose that is about the thing,” said MR. Bott, handing it in;
“I don’t see that the thief can mistake that.”
Informed that the tone of the note was less civil than is usual in business,
and that he must write as if addressing a respectable man.
(He wrote as follows):—
“Sir, I beg to state that you are obnoxious, (“No, I don't mean
that he is. We’ll try again”).
“Sir, I beg to state that your charges are obnoxious, some of them
that is to say, and I must admit that I think you are quite inconsistent
in regard to your conduct, because we agreed quite different to what
you put down in your bill, and must be revised and corrected. If you
will be so good as to take the trouble of calling upon MR. ScKEWMAN,

what we settled, and oblige “Yours obediently

MR. Bott declined making another epistolary attempt, stating that the
last was the best he could do, and quite civil and clear. The Eraminers
then proceeded to the second head.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NIGHTING ALE'S SONG TO THE SICK
SOLDIER.
LISTEN, soldier, to the tale of the tender NIGHTINGALE,
'Tis a charm that soon will ease your wounds so cruel,
Singing medicine for your pain, in a sympathising strain,
With a jug, jug, jug of lemonade or gruel.
Singing bandages and lint; salve and cerate without stint,
Singing plenty both of liniment and lotion
And your mixtures pushed about, and the pills for you served out,
With alacrity and promptitude of motion.
Singing light and gentle hands, and a nurse who understands
ow to manage every sort of application,
From a poultice to a leech; whom you haven’t got to teach
The way to make a poppy fomentation.
Singing pillow for you smoothed, smart and ache and anguish soothed,
By the readiness of feminine invention;
Singing fever's thirst allayed, and the bed you’ve tumbled, made,
With a careful and considerate attention.
Singing succour to the brave, and a rescue from the grave,
Hear the NIGHTINGALE that's come to the Crimea,
'Tis a NIGHTINGALE as strong in her heart as in her song,
To carry out so gallant an idea.
THE BOTTLE-HOLDER AND THE BOTTLE OF SMOKE.
MR. PUNCH, M.P. happened to remain late in the House of Commons
one night last year. He had promised his vote to LoRD PALMERSTON,
on the Smoke Bill. Curiously enough, instead of § up-stairs into
one of the quiet and sheltered nooks at the end of the gallery, and takin
an instalment of his might's rest, until the division should be calle
Mr. Punch actually listened to the debate, as respectfully (to outward
appearance) as if he could learn anything from anybody in that assembly.
†: has called the time night—but the weary clock, staring hard into
MR. SPEAKER's face, reminded him, savagely, that it was a quarter past
two. The public knows little of what happens in the Nether House
when the “little hours” come on. ...i. over, and the desultory
chat of the National Dustmen (whose number has then dwindled to that
of the occupants of certain jars in the Ali Baba story, or even to that
of certain Pieces of Silver whereoſ we have heard) is wisely compressed
by the Gallery into a brief note, that “the Bill was read a second time.”
or, though the cackle of geese might save the country, Editors prefer,
by omitting it, to save the morning mails. - -
Sometimes, however, the better men whom official red-tape ties to the
Treasury bench until the word “adjourn” cuts, the fetter, come out
at that uncontrolled hour, with denuded truths which the feel compelled
to drape, very jealously, during the period of set. and watchful
stenography. And on the Smoke Bill aforesaid did LoRD PALMeRSTON
say a shrewd thing—recently recalled to Mr. Punch's mind.
The Bottle-holder had determined that the Bill should pass through
a stage that morning, and the way in which he flung his open hand
upon air, as presenting his palm for a hand-shake before the fight,
testified to the observant that he meant business. Nevertheless one or
two members resisted—Wested Interest in stench, and bone-grubbing,
and poison, was duly represented—and progress with the measure was
deprecated. One - - -
his throat, that the proposed prevention of smoke was “impossible.”
“I have not the least–a–a—doubt in the world,” said the Wiscount,
rising, “that what the honourable member says is perfectly true. I have
had the-a-a-honour of a seat in this House for a good many years...I
have seen a good many impossibilities. I am certain that it is quite
impossible for people to consume their smoke instead of poisoning their
neighbours with it. But I am equally certain that if Parliament will
only enact that people shall consume their smoke instead of poisoning
other people with it, they will find it the easiest thing in the world. I
move, Sir, that the Bill be read a second time.” And it was—and
speedily passed.
Months went by, and no particular heed was given to the Smoke Act,
save by those immediately interested. Certain Gunpowder Smoke,
caused by a more pestilential nuisance on the banks of the Neva, made
us forget the black clouds on the banks of the Thames. But the Act
was being worked, and Mr. Punch has just read a paragraph, of which -
the following is the essence.
“Consumptiox or SMoke.—At the Court of the City Commissioners of Sewers, on
Tuesday, MR. H. L. TAYLoR stated that about twelve months ago MEssas. Calvear,
the great brewers, came to answer a complaint made against them for not having used
effectual means for the Consumption of the Smoke of their premises. The explanation
given at the time was not satisfactory, but additional time was granted. The difficulty
has been overcome. The consumption of smoke in this extensive concern has not been
attended with the expense which was anticipated by the proprietors. On the contrary,
the improvement has been accomplished by the judicious application of the stokers'
duties and the fuel alone. The whole of the smoke-consuming mystery was referrible-
to the state of the furnaces and the conduct of the stokers. It was a great advantage
to the community to be aware of that important fact, as there could now be no excuse for
the filthy discharges of smoke from the extensive manufactories in the metropolis. They
could all banish the nuisance by the most simple and cheap process.”
LoRD PALMERSTON has a good deal, to attend to just now, and
therefore Mr. Punch has not asked his lordship to callin Fleet Street and
be congratulated upon the literal fulfilment of his prophecy, Indeed
Mr. Punch prefers to bear this public testimony to his noble friend's
foresight. And he begs to notify to all whom it may concern, that as a
voyage from Chelsea to Blackfriars will prove to the most careless Eye
and the dullest Nose that the “filthy discharges”. above mentioned
still continue in unremitting plenitude of abomination, there is “no
excuse” for any of the authorities who shall neglect or delay to pursue
the offenders with all #. rigour and vigour. Meantime he drinks the
health of the reformed CALVERTs in a tankard of their best. It seems
to him to have a richer smack of healthful raciness now that it is
manufactured without poisoning the atmosphere.
THE BLESSING OF THE RUSSIAN OLD GENTIEMAN.
THE reserve of the Russian Imperial Guard—according to the Presse
-witnessed, the other day at St. Petersburg, a touching spectacle.
Our Parisian contemporary says:
“The Emperor reviewed them, and availed himself of the opportunity to bless at
the head of his troops the two Grand-Dukes Michael aud Nicholas, who, it is said.
are to join the active army. The benediction took place with much pomp. The two
Grand-Dukes went on their knees to receive it, and all the troops also knelt."
Pious souls' An edifying scene, doubtless; of thirty thousand and
odd pairs of eyes, nothing to be seen but the whites. Solemn silence;
the tongue of every man present thrust into his cheek, except the
ÇZAR's—that being employed in invoking Heaven's grace and bene-
diction on his offspring: sons of rapine and murder. One does not
envy. MICHAEL and young Nicholas, their father's benison. “The
blessings of the evil Genii, which are curses, were upon him,” are words
that would, one fancies, be evermore running in the ears of anybody
that had been blessed by OLD Nick.
Legal Intelligence. º
A PARAGRAPH has *W. on the subject of the small amount of
business, pending in Westminster Hall, which includes, only “three
new trials.”. We are authorised to add that there will be a fourth,
consisting of a “new trial,” which MR. BRIEFLEss is about to make to
obtain a living by his profession. It is however probable that this new :
trial will not swell the number mentioned in the official list, for the
new trial in question will not appear in the paper. There are only
“three cases set down for judgment,” but we understand that the
Benchers of one of the Inns of Court being about to lay in champagne,
have recently ordered “a case for judgment.” º

THE BATTLE OF THE ALMA, AS FOUGHT
AT ASTLEY’S.
(By “Our own Correspondent’—that is to say, the little gentleman in
ôlack, who represents the Press in the new Military Spectacle.)
º
º
HAVING provided my-
self with a ...
an umbrella, and an
eye-glass, which I in-
variably kept fixed in
my eye, I proceeded
to Southampton to
witness the embarka-
| tion of the British
troops, and to secure
a passage to Gallipoli.
For this latter pur-
pose, I addressed
myself to a private
soldier, who though
he proved the tender-
ness of his nature
by the affectionate
; manner in which he
bade farewell to his
sweetheart, had evi-
dently no great re-
spect for the profes-
sion of literature. He
| introduced me to the
Commander-in-Chief
as a “thing called a
penny-a-liner,” while
another individual
stated that I was a
“sillywillain.” He
evidently meant “ci.
vilian,” but whether his corrupt manner of pronouncing the word
proceeded from gross ignorance or a spirit of illiberal sarcasm, I cannot
say. The Commander-in-Chief was, on the whole, an agreeable sort
of gentleman, though somewhat grandiloquent. So much importance
did he attach to my presence, that after haranguing, his soldiers, he
delivered an oration on horseback for my exclusive benefit, warning
me to tell the truth in my report, and to take care of Russian bullets.
I need not occupy you with the passage to Gallipoli, but I must
hasten to remove the impression you may have received concerning
that much-abused town. You have heard it described as an abode of
overty and dirt, in fact, as a city of pig-sties. Nothing can be further
rom the fact. So luxurious is Gallipoli, that the municipality, at its
own expense, *. a company of opera-dancers, for the gratuitous
amusement of illustrious strangers. A very agreeable de trois was
|
danced by some young ladies, symbolizing England, France, and
Turkey, much to the delight of the Allied Forces, who were stationed
around to contemplate the grace and agility of the fair artistes. -
While at Gallipoli I made the acquaintance of an intelligent Irish-
man, who became my inseparable companion during the rest of the
expedition. 'º. on the most intimate terms with him, I never
could exactly make out, to what regiment he belonged, for while he
wore the new military habiliment, he never attached himself to any
corps, but perpetually carried on a little war against the Russians on
his own account, preferring the use of the shillelagh to that of the
musket. -

the sudden appearance of my friend and myself put an end to the
ruffian's proceedings. He was armed with his accustomed shillelagh;

degree, was a formidable weapon in a vigorous hand. The contest was

diplomatist in his appearance. #. walked among us in a rollicking
sort of manner, indulging in pleasantries of a somewhat rough, but by
no means ill-natured kind. Wit he does not, greatly appreciate, for
when, objecting to a diet of tallow-candles and train oil, I delicately
told him that I could not think of “taking all the fat of the land, and
leaving all the lean to the Russians,” he neither took the hint, nor
applauded the neatness of the sarcasm.
Never did I so º perceive the truth of the proverb, that warns
us not to measure other men's corn by our own bushel, than during
the time of my incarceration. The Russians, high and low, evidently
eat nothing but what in our country is needed by the chandler and the
soap-boiler. To this I do not object—let, them eat what they like.
But I do say it is a hardship on British prisoners that are forced to
live on such repulsive fare. As for my three friends and myself, we
were so disgusted with the cuisine of the prison, that we knocked down
.guard and set ourselves at liberty, in time to see the Battle of the
a.
Why the scene of this glorious action is called “the Alma,” I had
some difficulty in understanding. The definite article seemed to denote
a river, but º I made the most minute survey, nothing like water
of any kind could I discover. The heights are approached by a kind
of table-land, which is connected by a gentle declivity with a curious
round hollow. This is more like a dried-up lake than anything else,
and is called the “Cir-kuss” or “Cir-kass,” probably from the belief
that this country was once inhabited by Circassians. ... My classical
studies coming to my mind, I ...tº the legend of Alpheus and
Arethusa, and then it struck me that the Alma might perchance be
a subterranean stream. I made some inquiry on this subject of a
native in a fustian jacket, who told me that the inclined plane con:
necting the table-land with the Cir-cuss, went over the “Or-kees-tra,”
which is completely concealed. “Or-kees-tra” is doubtless the bar-
baric name which the Tartars of the Crimea have substituted for the
more elegant “Alma.”
The Allied Army in making the attack, first entered the Cir-cuss by
an aperture in its circumference, and then steadily advanced up the
inclined plane, till a few of them were repulsed by a party of Cossacks,
who kept them in the Cir-cuss while their comrades were engaged on
the table-land. I could not help admiring the order and amity, with
which the fight in the Cir-cuss was carried on. The combatants
crossed their weapons, and then their horses went round and round an
imaginary point, without any one making the slightest attempt to
wound his adversary. At last the Cossacks (why, I do not know)
considered themselves defeated, and retreated up the inclined plane,
followed by the Allies, who joining their companions took the heights
without further, difficulty. , At this moment, a curious natural phe-
nomenon might be observed. The atmosphere, which during the battle
had retained its usual no-colour, became of a brilliant red ſue as soon
as the victory was complete. I asked my friend in fustian the cause of
this phenomenon, when he told me drily, that “it gave effect to the
Tab-lo’—a native expression, which conveyed to me no meaning
whatever.
However, that some English words, even of an idiomatic kind, have
crept into the Crimea, was amply proved by the shout which was
raised by the inhabitants when the triumph of the Allies was complete.
At first there was a general cry of “Cook l’” which could only mean
that the goose of the Russian army was “cooked” by the Allied Forces.
Then followed a cry of “West : * clearly a tribute of admiration and

WE read in the Times that, at the Battle of Alma, the Russians

inappropriate in the war with Nicholas. Constables' staves would

brave soldiers to a taste for colours, which, however splendid, can only
exhibit a tint of mere greenness to the enemy.

A PRETTY GENERAL OPINION.
HERE-AND THEN-I FLATTER MysELF— * * * * * *
PET PIGS AT LEICESTER.
THE Leicester Mercury contains a pleasant paragraph, headed “THE
Pig, Question”; whence it appears that a crusade has been instituted
by the Local Board of Health against the Hogs, whilst the crusaders
have been strenuously resisted by the Hogs-in-Armour. We are
informed that:—
“At a numerous meeting held at the George Hotel, on Tuesday, an association was
formed for the Protection of Persons Keeping Swine, when upwards of 100 members
paid their subscriptions, and joined the association, with a full determination of resisting
the proceedings of the Local Board of Health.”
The immediate objects of this Association seem to be the defence of any
of its members who have been persecuted for the sake of their pig-sties
by being prosecuted for a nuisance; and the prevention of any burgesses
from being elected to the town council who, “are opposed to the
keeping of swine.” Nobody is opposed to the keeping of swine at a
reasonable distance from his nose; and the burgesses considered ob:
jectionable by the swinists can only be considered so for being opposed
to the keeping of pigs among the houses of Leicester. Whether the
pig-party go so regularly, the whole hog as to excommunicate muni-
§ all their fellow citizens who are ayerse to pigs in the parlour,
is a question to be asked, considering their enthusiasm on the score of
the pig, indicated by their concluding toast; viz.:-
“May the opponents of swine never eat a pork pie, see a ham, chew a bit of bacon,
or taste a delicate morsel of sucking pig."
Chew, a bit of bacon; what strength of expression!—worthy of
philosophers feasting on the Worum Organon. Of course the opponents
of swine would be opposed to pork pies, or pig in any shape; but with-
out opposing swine as we should oppose wolves, we should think the
most . pig-fancier would grant that we might oppose their claims
to the privileges of cats and spaniels. We are further told that similar
meetings have been held in Coventry; and we can only say that we
will never march through Coventry with any lº, who would wish
to make its streets in the state they would be brought to if pigs were

IMPORTANT MEETING.
TO THE (FEMALE) HEADS OF FAMILIES.
AT alarge meeting of the hair-dressers and coiffeurs, lately
held in the Burlington Arcade—and at which Mossieur.
Félix, “le dieu de la Coiffure,” was unanimously voted
into the hair-cutting chair—it was resolved that, with a
view of upholding the true interests of the profession, a
e be founded to oppose la rage that was at present
so deplorably manifest among all English ladies in having
their hair dressed, no matter whether it was becoming to
them or not, in the same style as the EMPREss Eugénie.
Such a stupid system should at once be torn up by the
roots. Accordingly the following resolution was carried 1.
without a single comb being raised against it:
“That for the future, no true-minded Coiffeur, or Artiste
en C. ar, having a proper respect for himself, or for the
glorious Art of which he is an humble instrument, should
allow himself to dress & "Impératrice any head of hair that
is put into his hands, labouring under the following primº
facie ridiculous disqualifications.
"...I. All young ladies, who have already reached the age.
of forty.
"II. All young ladies, who have pug noses, pink eyes
white eyelashes, and low foreheads. - -
“III. All young ladies, whose eyes are not perfectly
regular, or who wear spectacles.
“IV. All young ladies, whose locks are decidedly of a
vermilion hue, or of an auburn rather more than suspect.
“V. All young ladies who may be entrusted with the
|. education of young children, as it would only put
foreign notions into the heads of their young charges, that
they will learn quite soon enough as they get older.
“WI. And, lastly, all young ladies whose positions, or
complexions, are not exactly suited for such an imperial
| style, of head-dress, as it only tends to attract notice that,
in all phases and faces, may not be exactly favourable, or
complimentary.”
Wig blocks, illustrative of the various disqualifications.
enumerated, were exhibited, and afforded general amuse-
meeting.

UPON ONE OF THE ELEGANT GUIDES.
DISTRESSING EFFECT OF ENGLAND’S ROUGH HOSPITALITY
AN OLD FOGEY CLUB.
AMong the rubbish that regularly falls into our hands
every week, is a lithographed prospectus of a proposed
“all old Putney men.” Why it should be more desirable
to collect the veterans of
Chelsea, Kensington, or any other suburb, we are at a loss
to conceive; and indeed, if the object is only to get together
a mass of senile imbecility we think Kensington is the place
best adapted to furnish the materials of . a combination
of age and incapacity.
If it is desirable to start an Old Fogey Club, why should
the Old Fogeyism which constitutes a qualification for
membership be claimed exclusively for the “Old Putney
Men,” when there are old Greenwich men, old Chelsea men
old Brompton men, old Kensington men, aye! and
women too, that would constitute such a phalanx of
suburban seniority as might make the veteranship of Putney
hide its j head in the very first Welsh wig or cotton
nightcap that it could catch hold of . We perceive that
the rules are well adapted to the aged classes for whom
the club is designed, as all the members are expected to be
in bed by eleven. . We fear, however, that it will not be
º with the old ladies, as “spirituous liquors” are to
be “entirely excluded.”
Homage to the Drama.
ANOTHER Dramatic Petition, infinitely more numerousl
signed than that presented to MR. G.W. BRooke, will
shortly be presented to an eminent tragedian, who performs
within 500 miles of Oxford Street... It has already received
the signatures of all the Clubs, Libraries, Reading-rooms,
and Literary and Mechanics' Institutions in the Metropolis;
and it is to be hoped
desired effect. The object of the Petition is, we need hardly
say, to beg of the eminent tragedian who performs within
500 miles of Oxford Street, as he loves the Drama and
|values his reputation, to have the kindness to leave for
Australia as soon as he possibly can.
THE FAMILY HERALD.—A Monthly Nurse.
FROM WINDSOR TO ST. PETERSBURG.
MR. PUNCH has been solicited by the respected housekeeper, of
Windsor Castle to give insertion to the subjoined letter (dispatched
via Prussia, and favoured by Prussia's king) to the EMPERoRNicholas.
The letter, arriving at the last minute, } Punch had no time to send
even an electric message to the respectable gentlewoman who keeps, as
Enmund BURKE says, “Windsor's proud keep,” to have the document
duly authenticated. The letter, for aught Mr. Punch knows, may have
been furtively obtained from the writing-desk of its authoress; a copy
of it may have been taken on the way to its destination, the more es:
Wº if the envelope were . “private and confidential.”
ith this, Mr. Punch, as a public editor, has nothing to do. Mr. Punch
can only state that, to the best of his eyesight, the letter—(at least his
copy)—is not lithographed. To print a purely private letter may be
then?... He puts down his feelings with a strong hand, and devotes
himself to the requirements of the public.
To the EMPEROR or ALL THE Russias from the HousekEEPER OF
ALL WINDsor CASTLE.
“MAY IT PLEASE YoUR MAJESTY, IF YOU PLEASE,
“I HAve long had a burden in my bosom which is a brooch.
When your Imperial Šſ. did us the honour of a visit here at
Windsor, there wasn't a heart you didn't leave with your picture behind
you. . You did me the honour (and when you did it, if I didn't think I
should have died with cetonishment; and should, I'm certain, but for
the mild eyes (not that saving your presence I'll ever believe in eyes
again)—the mild eyes in the royal head that looked so gracious on me;
and the sweet smile, as innocent as any baby's weaned on milk an
honey, on your royal lips.
“May it please your Majesty, when you went away, that very
morning you gave me with your own hand a brooch as you said as a
small reward for my attention, I shall never forget your lofty manner
and your gracious words. When you put the brooch in my hand, I
thought I should have fainted; but then the thoughts of proud Mindsor
about as moral as to pick a private pocket; Mr. Punch feels this: what |P
(as I’ve heard our Castle called) supported me, and it wasn't until I'd
reached the maids’ room that, with the brooch in my hand, I dropt in
a chair like any stone /
“May it please your Majesty, I wasn't myself for a week; nor, in-
deed, were any of us. Your Imperial affability turned the whole place
topsy-turry, and when you took #. of us for Russia (where you said,
as I heard it said, you hoped some day to see a certain, graciºus person,
whom I won't name, any further than by pointing to the highest lady in
the land), when you took leave of us, not a soul knew whether the
stood upon their head or their heels. It took me more than a wet
to come to anything like myself; you put us all—as I heard one of the
Equerries was heard to say—in such a heaven of presents; a perfect
paradise of rings and snuff-boxes. Not but what, as I’ve said before,
mine was a brooch! -
“May it please your Majesty,+I can never forget, saving your
resence, our first meeting. I’ve been used to royal blood, being born
in the Castle, the British Standard—as I’ve heard my mother say—
waving over my cradle / I’ve been used, I say, to royal blood from a
baby upwards, and have had to see things set to rights for crowned
heads of both seres, with the rest of their royal families. , But when I
was called up to your imperial Majesty, my teeth did chatter, and I
felt in a twitter.
“There was the state-bed—and the pains I'd taken about it, bran-new
damask, with the Russian eagle in dead gold at the head and the tester
—the state-bed ; and there stood your Majesty. I see your * at
this very minute. “A soldier’—you said—and my heart fluttered like
a whole cage of little birds—‘a soldier sleeps anywhere. There I shall
sleep,” and as you said this, you poi

folding bedstead, in old iron, that #.

and covered with a mattrass in Russian leather. ere you slept,
turning your back upon the bed of state and your own eagles in gold
and damask.
“‘The EMPERoR of Russia’—said I to myself when I’d got into
my own room—‘the EMPERoR of Russia’s a downright Christian if
ever EMPERoR of Russia was 1” And upon that bedstead, and on that
Russian leather, your Majesty slept every night, and the state bed was
never so much as rumpled. What a lowly heart-I was always thinking

gentleman /
“Your Imperial Majesty went away, and there wasn't a dry eye in
Windsor. You might have walked over us, in your boots, and hardly a
soul but would have blessed your spurs. I’m bold enough to write
this, to show you what you’ve lost; to bring you back to the paths of
§: º peace, if I’m not too bold in mentioning such things to your
Lajesty.
“A small reward for my attention / They were your Royal words,
when i. put the brooch into my hand. Small or otherwise, it was
more than enough for my deserts; for what had I done, but seen that
your Majesty's, Russian leather bed , was shaken, and your pillow
smoothed? Still, that brooch I carried in my bosom; ºld still, what-
ever I heard against you, I believed in LoRD ABERDEEN (as steady-
going nobleman as ever slept), and smiled in scorn. You go to war
with England / The EMPEROR N1cholas that had given his arm to
our gracious QUEEN, and smiled so with his mild eyes at every word—
he to draw the sword, and flourish it in the face of HER blessed
Majesty. He who had slept upon our iron bedstead—slept sweetly as
any baby-under, the banner of Royal, Windsor, he to bring his
Cossacks into the Castle, and to give us all up to the proud invader /
“No, your Imperial Majesty, I wouldn’t believe it. I read the
speeches of LoRD ABERDEEN-upon my word and honour erery word
of 'em—and was I not a female, would say, I still swore by you. When
º: here called you names, I would look down upon the brooch in
my bosom, and just pity 'em.
“But the scales have fallen from my eyes, and now I see the truth.
I’ve struggled, but at last give up. That brooch has got hotter and
Åotter, and at last began to scorch and burn me like burning coal. I
began at first to think I couldn't wear it without being a traitor to my
Royal Mistress—(I hope she’ll never believe in an Emperor again,
wherever he may come from 1)—but now have snatched the burning
thing away, and return into your Majesty's hands the snake I have too
long warmed.

CROSSING SWEEPING AS A FINE ART.
It is said that “New brooms sweep clean,” but a new spirit will
o more with even an old broom, than could be effected by the newest
of birches in the hands of one who keeps to the ordinary track of
Crossing Sweepers. -
We have noticed a genius in the neighbourhood of St. James's
Palace, in the shape of a ragged boy, who has started in the rather
startling line of an “Artist in Crossing Sweeping.” There are some
people who adorn every thing they touch, and here is an instance of an
urchin who, while touching mud, invests it with a grace and a senti-
ment not exactly “beyond the reach of art,” but within its legitimate
precincts. He has converted Crossing Sweeping into one of the Fine
Arts, for he has decorated his crossing with various devices, in which
loyalty is the dominant feature, though patriotism sometimes enjoys
the ascendancy. A few days ago the “artist” had arranged the super-
fluous mud swept from the crossing into the form of a crown, sur-
rounded by the words, “God save the QUEEN;” and on the day
“(PRINCE PICKLEHERRINGER, one of the Cousin-Germans to the
KING OF PRUssia, has promised to get his Royal Master to send the
brooch back to you. And so I’ve done my duty to my QUEEN, Windsor
Castle, my country, and myself %
“And now, Nicholas—for I’ve dropped the Emperor, and come
without ceremony to the man—now, Nicholas; tremble and be warned
by what I’m going to tell you. Last night as ever was I had a
dream. I thought }. were once again in the Castle; I thought you'd
once again gone to bed upon the old iron.: and I thought I was neither
asleep nor awake; nor full-dressed, nor undressed, but as I may say
between the two. And then I dreamt I went right off asleep, when f
was awoke, as I thought still in my dream, by a dreadful smell of
something º like roasting. Still dreaming, I jumped
up, my flannel gown—(which in case of Ée I always have)—wrapped
about me, and went with great presence of mind to your room |
“Nicholas, there you lay, upon that iron bedstead: every bit of the
iron, red-hot / There you lay, and ground your teeth, and looked at me,
and couldn't speak outright, but fº you said something that
sounded like Sigh No Pay–Sigh No Pay; as much, perhaps, as to sa
that no amount of sighs were then of any use. Well, the bedstea
still glared redder and redder, and you seemed turning into tinder,"
when I thought all the dead gold eagles from the state bed gave, with
their double heads, a double scream, and I, trying to scream also-I
then awoke -
“N1cholas, think of the iron bedstead that a wicked Emperor's sins
may, at his last hour, make red hol, and
“Believe me,
“Still your Well-wisher and Adviser,
“THE Housekeeper.”
“P.S. As I’ve sent back the brooch, don't you think you'd better
return the parter / Your banner still hangs in St. George's Hall, but,
since the war—I don’t know what can have put it in their heads—the
flies have used it shockingly.”
following, the device was changed to an anchor, with a motto com-
plimentary to the British Navy. It is to be lamented that such genius
should be provided with no better School of Design than the street
and that such fertile invention should have no other bank than a bank o
road-dirt to draw upon. We recommend the patrons of art to keep their
eyes on the crossing, lest some incipient WILKIE should be nipped in
the bud, or only live to be “blowed” by some insensible policeman.

A SUNDAY BAND OF HOPE.
-ºl. HE Concert performed
by the Guides at
Exeter Hall merits
peculiar notice. The
Guides had been
playing on the pre-
vious Sunday, on
Windsor {...}. Ter-
race, under HER
MAJESTY's window.
Yet Exeter Hall
opened its doors to
receive them. Now,
if Exeter. Hall has
no objection to a
band playing at the
UFEN’s Palace on
the Sunday, of course
it can have no ob-
jection to a similar
performance on the
- same day at the Pal-
ace of the People.
We do not mean to express, a wish that the People should have
“Pop goes the Weasel,” and tunes, of that description performed
for their Sunday recreation at the Crystal Palace. Let Exeter Hall
º: the advice of M. Costa), prescribe the programme. Sacred
y-sacred music; but, be it recollected, all goºd music is sacred:
good music being that which moves the heart and the higher emotions,
and not merely the lower feelings and the heels. Surely, any serious
family—and seriousness sometimes degenerates into stupidity—would
be much more edified on a Sunday afternoon by hearing HANPEI.
and MozART, than by sitting together in doors dozing, and those half
awake listening to the snoring of the others.
The Directors of the Crystal Palace, probably, could make some
arrangement for not taking money at the Station, or at the doors of the
building, if that were felt to be wrong. Admission might be had by
tickets only, the requisite facilities for obtaining them in various parts
of Town being provided during the week. The only thing that could
then remain to be demurred to would be the Railway journey; but if
a bishop's carriage may take its proprietor to church on a Sunday,
without impeachment, surely a steam engine may be permitted to
convey the public to a place whither they go to hear sacred music.
Exeter Hall º approve of the above suggestion the more
cordially that it would, if adopted, tend greatly to the advantage of
frotestantism at the expense of Popery, by setting . a rivalry to the
latter in the attraction of music, which would be much more rful,
as well as more pleasant, than the discords of controversy.
A DINNER FOR EVERYBODY.
The following deserves to take a very high place—the top of the
Column—among the curiosities of advertising literature:-
OTICE. During a temporary residence, in Brighton, a gentleman
wants a young gentlemanly man to breakfast with him, and an elderly person to
dine with him, every day, during which hours they will be treated as friends.
Address, A. K., Bristol Hotel.
The “ .."; gentlemanly man” must find great difficulty in breaking
his fast, and the “elderly Fº ” must be hard up indeed for a dinner,
who would accept a meal on the terms proposed. . It is like adding
sauce to the matutinal cutlet and the afternoon joint, to offer.ſhe
* friendship” of the advertiser during the hours of mealtime, Who
would accept a friendship that is to cool with the heater of the urn,
and be dropped after the cheese? who, in fact, would accept the double
cut (from the joint and the host,) and come again. We campt pretend
to enter so far into the philosophy of dining and breakfasting, as
to speculate on the feeling which P. the selection of youth
for the companion of a breakfast, and age for the adjunct of a dinner.
Should the advertiser take tea, we could understand his advertising
for an elderly lady as an appropriate vis-à-vis at the tea table, and we
shall keep our eyes on the provincial papers, to watch the result. We
can imagine the mountain of answers that the gentleman will receive,
who wants a youthful and an elderly companion for his daily meals;
Everybody who cannot get a dinner, has now an opportunity, provided
he is of sufficient age. As there is no margin named in the adver.
tisement, the applicants will begin at five and thirty, and go on to an
almost fabulous age, till it extends to those who have not a tooth left
to masticate the object of their desires. We think it, would be but
fair on the part of the advertiser to give a carte of his daily dinner, as
it may not be every kind of dinner that even the hungriest would sit
down to. We trust the advertiser will repeat his advertisement in a
more explanatory form. -
THE DEWOTED.
Who says that the heroic stirs no longer
In this our English life;
That in rude times men's frames and hearts were stronger,
Their souls in faith more rife;
That luxury has sapped the deep foundation
wº: alone is based d
What makes a great man, and a mighty nation;
Till noble deed, and lofty *:::::: y
Like giants, in a pigmy population,
Seem monstrous and misplaced P
Whoso says this makes falsehood more than truth,
Good weak, and evil strong,
Sets forceful manhood under stormy youth,
Asserts God's rule is wrong.
Our heart revolts against the withering creed;
And though our eyes were blind,
There shines an inner light, by which we read
It is not, and could never be decreed,
Ill should on good, not good on ill succeed-
Or woe to human kind!
And if sight fail, and if that inner light
Darkling, at times, appear,
Out of the war, where good and evil fight !
(Our fainting faith to cheer),
Some champion of the Right, when cowards fly,
Restores the battle ; ;
Still rears his spotless flag against the sky,
Still shouts aloud his glorious rallying cry,
Still shows how soldiers of the faith can die,
Wictors o'er World and Will.
Such champions our ºl. still has found,
When needed, aye at hand.
Sneerer, put off thy sneer, and look around—
Behold them where they stand!
Where storm-winds rave, and sunless skies lie dark
About the Arctic shore,
Devoted FRANKLIN and his sailors mark,
Wrestling with death upon their ice-bound bark,
Wandering anon—then frozen stiff, and stark,
But suffering no more.
Look Southward now : the wounded of our foes
Strew Alma's bloody plain
The victors march upon the battle's close,
But one wills to remain.
A man we knew not—never thought to know-
Who what he can will try.
Moving among that mass of pain and woe,
* H. his work of mercy, to and fro,
e used his life in succouring the foe,
Then sought his friends—to diel
I said “one willed to stay”—I was unjust;
He did not stay alone.
A soldier-servant shared the ghastly trust,-
His name, ev'n, is unknown,
And there in faith and love and duty strong,
Among that writhing hºst
Of enemies, all day and all night long,
Defying chance of violence or wrong,
To entomb the dead, and help the living throng-
These two men held their post!
Nor to men only such heroic mould
Of heart is given.
See yonder band of women-young and old-
No muns, yet brides of Heaven ;
Forsaking all that to their sex is dear-
Some, wealth—all, home and ease-
Womanly pity chasing woman's fear,
They go to bind lopped limbs, pale heads to rear,
And with soft touch, and softer speech to cheer
Our sufferers o'er the seas'
If England have aught good,'tis that she knows
Due reverence to give
To those who die in duty's work, and those
For duty's work who live.
Grieving for all that these great dead have borne,
All these great living bear,
We know they die and suffer, to adorn
Life with examples—such as, though we mourn,
In our hearts and our children's shall be worn
While men breathe English air!

THROUGH the pine-trunks spare, o'er the steppes
so bare, -
Who walks with a pace of pride?
A maiden fair, with abundance of hair,
And nothing on beside'
With her unshod feet o'er the stones she stept,
And when she came to a brook,
Lightsomely over the water she leapt,
And all were free to look.
Neither for man nor boy she stopt—
Well might they stand at gaze—
Nor ever her broad bright eyes she dropt,
Though theirs stood wide with amaze.
And—a sight all must own exceedingly rare
In any civilised land–
This travelling fair no º: did bear,
But a looking-glass in her hand-
In which—a fact more singular still—
She ne'er looked at her own perfections,
Though all she met might stare their fill,
And indulge in their own reflections.
Oh wonder of woman! a baggageless lass,
In purissimis naturalibus
On a steppe, where from daylight to dark you
might pass,
Nor e'er have a chance to hail a buss |
So lightly she walked, and swiftly she ran,
Until she came to the Pruth—
When I knew her fºy seen by man—

Oh proud was the light in her eye so bright,
As she . her wavy hair
That it showered a blaze of golden rays
About her forehead fair.
And then came a voice, made my heart rejoice,
With its music clear and strong—
“Have I waded through mire, and flood and
re—
Have I braved all wrath and wrong—
Have I shaken my glass in the tyrant's face—
Have I reared it strong in faith,
Where priestly knaves were teaching slaves
That to look therein was death—
Have I borne all |. and worn all chains,
And smiled on brand and bar—
That Siberia or knout, should bar me out
From the Empire of the Czar !
I laughed as I heard, thy warning word,
How I prize it, be witness true.”
With a flash and a gleam, on the Pruth's wide

She’s in and she’s over too !
There’s a rattle and clank on the further bank,
Where, all in the Muscovite mud,
Stands, sword on flank, a cortége of rank
To receive her from the flood.
And through the rushes, with bows and blushes,
And discreetly averted face,
Two Generals hand fair Truth to land,
With the well-known Russian !
As the lady steps out, all face right about,
As dreading to behold her;
Though a young aide or two take a kind of slue,
And a sort of a glance o'er the shoulder,

A GREATER MAN THAN THE EMPEROR OF
AIL THE RUSSIAS.
UR old friendMADAMETussaul's
Exhibition will be very in-
complete, without the addition
of the extraordinary model
mentioned in the subjoined
paragraph from the Liverpool
standard:—
“A Model CABMAN.—The other
night JAMEs LoMAs, a Cabman, re-
ceived half-a-sovereign from his fare,
in mistake, which he duly returned
next day to his employer, MR. HAMER,
stating from whom he had it. We
believe that LoMAs, who has been
20 years in MR. HAMER's employ, has
been frequently known to do similar
acts. Some little while ago, one of
our Merchants, residing in Aigburtli,
had a sovereign returned him by
LoMAs, which had been given him in
like manner by mistake. Such traits
of honesty in a class who are too often
known as affording examples of an
opposite line of conduct, cannot have
too much publicity, inasmuch as it
gives an excellent incentive to others to follow the like example.”
LoMAs is really a much greater man than the majority of those of
whom likenesses are made in wax or even in marble, #. any well-
ordered collection of images, molten or graven, his figure, would-be
F. in a high position. His bust would be put along with the good
eads; and not in the same row with Courvoisier and DANIEL Good.
At what a height it would be classed above the EMPEROR OF Russia’s'
That, indeed, could not be suffered to stand on the rank of common
cabmen; fellows who are guilty of mere extortion and insolence, and
not of absolute robbery: much less of murder. It would have to be
ranged with that of NERO, and the casts of BURKE, and BISHOP, and
WILLIAMs; differing from these only in wanting—for the present—
perhaps only for the present—a certain groove around the neck.
Why compare the EMPEROR Nicholas with LoMAs the CABMAN ?
Because the comparison between the two individuals, conspicuous at
the same moment, is natural. NICHOLAs and LoMAs appear in the
papers together; both remarkable : one as an honest man, the other as
a villain; LoMAs with his twenty years of good character, and good
life : N1cholas, with his more than twenty years of infamy and evil
reign. LoMAs is the greater man. He has more in him of that which
constitutes man. All the magnitude of Nicholas consists in what is
bestial. If a boa-constrictor were endowed with a little intellect, and
had great power given it over men, the reptile would act just as the
CzAR does: that Russian serpent, whose head is in the Baltic, and tail
in the Black Sea, whence, unless it is chopped off there, it will coil
round Europe. -
Ascend, mentally, towards Heaven, some little way higher than you
can soar in a balloon: then look down at LoMAs restoring the coin,
and at Nicholas trying to seize the territory, which, respectively, did
not belong to them. Then see which is the finer thing. Observe, as
you rise, how the acts of the two men come more and more largely
into moral contrast. How, by degrees, all the greatness of the CzAR's
raseally enterprise, as apparent to the eyes of snob and flunkey,
decreases. The thunder of the cannon gets fainter and fainter till you
cease to hear it, the death-fires dwindle to sparks, and the glimmer of
a rushlight. . But the act of which the noise and the blaze are acces-
sories remains neither more nor less than an attempt at burglary,
accompanied with murder. As the -
and more like a star, the crime gets divested of all the dignity which
it derives, in that planet, from affecting a large part of it; loses all the
importance attaching to the robbery which is extensive: and appears
as petty as any larceny that does not arise from want, and pettier
than that.
On the other hand the upright conduct of LoMAs increases in mag-
nitude as you regard it from higher regions. You see the half-sovereign
not in its proportion to the riches of the Bank of England, but in its
relation to the earnings of a cabman. It then seems a great enough
thing to part with : and you perceive that as a work of indefinite
charity was done by a widow, with a mite, so may, a considerable act
of justice be performed by a cabman with a ten-shilling piece.
A New Opening.
QYSTER-KNIVEs are much cheaper this year. This"cheapness, we
understand, is principally owing to the large number of razors that have
been thrown out of employ by the Beard and Moustache movement,
and that have been driven, poor blades, into the oyster line to find an
opening for their talents.

KEAN v. PICKARD—MANAGER. v. MUSICIAN.
MR. CHARLEs KEAN is the depositary of a trust, a great public trust,
and he knows it, and comforts himself accordingly. He is licensed to
give the best entertainment to a scrupulous English }. : and there-
upon he engages the very best horn-players and fiddlers (the most
musical brass and the most melodious cat-gut) for his orchestra. More-
oyer, that the English public aforesaid may have its sensitive, appre-
ciative ears, always fed and entertained, the managerial trustee binds
every trumpeter and fiddler in a bond of ten pounds “not to be absent”
from the duties of trumpeting or fiddling, when required in the
orchestra. The British º expect the presence of the musicians,
and the British public should have it. This cause came on last week
in the Southwark county court, and ended with a burst of triumph for
the manager. It is long indeed since MR. CHARLEs KEAN has made
so successful a hit.
The fiddler is punished, the fiddler is mulcted in the sum of ten
pounds (; a jewel with a fiddler's keeping”); nevertheless, the very
justice of the verdict causes the contemplative, philosophic mind to
ask—wherefore should not the like justice be meted out in every case
in which the British public, as patient visitors to the Princess's
Theatre, are ; interested? How often, for instance, have they
#. to see Macbeth according to SHAKSPEARE, and Macbeth, the
hane, has been from the rising of the curtain to the going down of
the same, absent—absent as PICKARD when, as proved ...;
with JULLIEN ? How often have simple-hearted folks laid down har
shillings in the belief that, at the Princess's, they were to see Hamlet:
and Hamlet has been altogether omitted, there being nobody in his
place but MR. CHARLEs KEAN ?
These thoughts, entered the brain of Punch, and—all for the sake of
the public, for why should fiddlers be fined, and managers go free ?-
Punch put the case to a counsel very learned in the laws of the land.
Could the public recover of MR. KEAN for the absence, throughout
the whole play, of Hamlet or Macbeth, when duly advertised to appear,
or otherwise to be fully and efficiently represented P. Could the public
recover? In a word, could they have their money back P
And the counsel answered—“No ; because at the foot of the play-
bills there is this intimation—No money returned?” Let, it therefore
be clearly understood that people pay for SHAKSPEARE at the Princess's
wholly at their own peril.
NURSES OF QUALITY FOR THE CRIMEA.
THE noble example set by Miss NIGHTINGALE has excited emulation.
A large number ºyoung ladies met, yesterday, at PHYLLIS's Rooms,
to . into consideration the question of proceeding to the Crimea,
in the capacity of Nurses.
The fauteuil was occupied by the HoN. Miss FLou NCESTER, who, in
a few words, expressed the object of the assembly. She said every one
was talking of the dreadful state the Soldiers were in for want of
proper Nurses. Who could bear to think of it without doing all she
| could to relieve the suffering which they were enduring on our account?
It would be so pretty, too, as well as so right, to go out as Nurses to
the poor fellows. Miss NIGHTINGALE had given a ſon to the thing:
and on one's return one would be quite distinguée. They had had some
experience in dressing; and now was the time to show it.
Miss WALTZINGHAM said that an evening party gave her no pleasure
when she thought of the balls flying about at Sebastopol. Who could
enjoy an ice or a glass of lemonade, whilst our heroes had no one to
...} them a little toast-and-water? She was quite willing to go out,
| * the passage might be unpleasant: and a voyage always made
her III.
Miss Polker would be delighted to go. She had heard of baggage-
waggons, and should not mind riding in one a bit. , Qr if that was all,
she could march. Give her only a parasol and her Indian-rubber
. and she would walk ever so far—she would walk the military
ospitals.
Miss PiscINA CoPEstole said that the ministry of surgical aid to
the wounded by female hands was customary in the ages of faith. The
roposed act of self-devotion was approved by the Church, and no
§. the bishops would bestow, their blessing on it.: so that it would
be sure to prosper. To attend the sick was one of the corporal works
of mercy.
Miss WAGLEY said she hoped it was sergeant as well as corporal.
Miss GREENwood said they should take plenty of things with them.
| She did not mean clothes; but things for the poor men. Stuff to rub
in for bruises: for how bad must be a bruise from a great cannon ball!
And then there would be such sad cuts to dress. Every one who went
as nurse had better take out plenty of Court plaster.
Here a desultory conversation ensued as to which would be the
costume most eligible for the lady-nurses. That of La Figlia del

The Lost Sheep Restored.
- RUSSIAN TOYS.
THE Russian Prisoners in England' and France are amusing their
leisure, and increasing their resources, by the manufacture of small toys,
models, and knick-knacks, in the making of which they flºº much
ingenuity, and for which a ready sale is found. That such of Mr. Punch's
readers as *: desire any other reminder of the war than the daily
papers and the doubled income-tax afford, may be able to make, a
; he subjoins a list which has been furnished to him by
authority.
The KNoUT.—These models are very neatly constructed, and the
makers, have evidently enjoyed, the advantage of close personal
acquaintance with the object they have reproduced. The Knout for the
EMPERQR's male children is made with an ebony handle, that with which
the God of Russia and the Father of his People causes his daughters to
be chastised (for their good) is in ivory. The executioner's knout,
which can either prolong a culprit's agonies during a morning, or dismiss
him to another tribunal with a couple of cuts, according to the will, or
temper, of his Imperial Father, is made from some treasured bits of the
. used in the Cathedral of St. Isaac.
MoDEL CANNON.—These are in wood, and are exact copies, reduced,
of the guns in the unreduced ports of the Baltic. , The modellers vouch
for their accuracy, the guns and miniature balls having been made out
of the same wood as the originals which have kept SIR CHARLEs
NAPIER at bay.
., HUMAN, FIGUREs.-These are not very successful. The Russian
idea of male beauty seems to be enormous height, and black moustaches.
Nor are the female figures much better, with the exception of some
ingenious ones in an elaborate model of the shrine of Minsk. The
nuns, in every attitude of terror and torture, are represented as under-
going the penalties which were inflicted by the Father of his People
upon these contumacious religionists, and the mangled bodies of the
girls who have been murdered are depicted with much imitative
accuracy.
Dissected MAPs.-A few of these, suggested by educational remi-
miscences, have been drawn, and carved by the prisoners. The world
is their chief subject. Russia is the centre, and all the other countries
are small islands, lying in shadow. .
MACHINERy-Generally speaking, the models of machines attempted
by the prisoners are ludicrously simple. A miniature cart, for con-
veying wheat, is exactly in the primitive form described by HERODotus,
on which no improvement has been made for ages, and a water-machine
is precisely that which has been in working on the banks of the Nile
from time immemorial. But a little contrivance for a lemon-squeezer
or similar purpose, is clever. It has a series of clutches, each more
rigid than the preceding. In satire, it is to be p. the makers
give each a name. The lemon they call the Serf, and the first squeeze
is given by a pair of flaps called the Crown. Then a closer hold is taken
by a pair inside, called the Lord. , Aſter this comes the Soldier, next
the Qſicial. And when all these have exhausted the lemon, and it is
nearly dry, it is pierced through by a sort of prod called the Priest, and
lººp is obtained. The invention is said to be in general use

i MR. PUNch gives notice that until England and the United States

ALBINIA and HoRACE, revolving with excessive grace, and looking the
delight each felt in the other's admiration, stung the haughty Judge
with an unaccustomed pang, and he vowed vengeance. Accustomed to
all the artifices of law, a plot was with JUDGE BEAKUM the work of a
moment. His fiendly smile followed the coruscating couple, as the
costly robe of ALBINIA touched him, like a seraph’s wing, in her flight,
and he said to MR. ST. JULLIEN, glancing at HoRACE-
“I hope that he means to escape. Swindling is but smartness in

justice to the Labour of the Brain. And by way of setting a good
example, he begs to purloin the following, brilliant and sparkling tale
from the pen of one of the most fashionable authors of the States.
As it is now the custom for publishers to set forth their own disin-
terested opinion of the works they issue, Mr. Punch will add that the t.

are charmingly blended with the strong effects of the French novelists;
while in addition, such homage is paid to millinery, upholstery, and the
| almighty dollar, as befits the writer who addresses a commercial
community.

GRACEFULLY-oh how gracefully did the lovely ALBINIA ST. JULLIEN
glide through the dance that night. The glorious creature moved with
that proud and swamlike freedom known only to women whose infancy
has been swaddled in the star-spangled banner, freedom to which neither
the awkward yet haughty aristocrat of London, nor her superior, the
elaborate-mannered and artificial dame of Paris, can ever pretend. The
costly, velvet . from DAGBY AND JEWKINs's, scarcely yielded to
her white satin s º as she skimmed along, and the alabaster nymphs
wherewith HIRAM Power’s gifted chisel had garnished the magnificent
salon, scarcely equalled in elegance its beautiful young mistress. How
superbly she looked, as the strains of BAwLKY’s wonderful band bore
her on their stream of melody—how the diamonds, with which her robe
was thickly set at every hem, flashed in the light of one of REHOBOTH's
world famous or molu chandeliers. She was indeed a rapture and a
gush, and an emanation from the stars.
Music—what need had ALBINIA of music to mark her steps? She
had imbibed, it is true, the teaching of our most celebrated professors,
whose skill (as is admitted by all who have seen American dancing) is
unequalled. But she needed it not. The plash-dew from the marble
fountain in her gilded hall fell not more certainly upon the rich mosaic
pavement than did her tiny foot touch the embossed flowers at the
iven moment when it was due. Her heart, her soul, were in the
nce, and a planet might have strayed from its appointed orbit more
easily than could ALBINIA ST. JULLIEN have swerved from her graceful
Career.
. The Honour ABLE HoRACE F. PotLucky watched her with a lover's
intense gaze. Could aught earthly come up to ALBINIA, that godlike
form, redolent of nature's nobility, might seem to balance her. A tall,
ale forehead, lustrous as marble, exquisitely voluptuous Grecian
eatures, eyes of the most unutterable violet, hair jetty as the raven's
wing—such was HoRACE F. Pot LUCKY. Already he had distinguished
himself in the field and in the council. Though still under sixteen, the
dauntless young republican had made his voice heard in the Caucus

“I would hope,” said her partner,
I have acquitted myself so well that I shall not be discharged as yet.”
“I guess you are a queer Judge, some,” retorted the spirituel
HQRACE, “not to know that discharge always follows acquittal.”
“Then I move for a new trial,” said the Judge, displeased at being
thus successfully reckoned up by one so much younger.
“Rule refused, with costs,” responded HöRACE, and the next mo-
ment his arm was around the yielding waist of the beauty, and he bore
her away. The dark eye of the Judge lowered flashingly upon him, but
it was for an instant only. Trained to conceal his fiercest emotions,
JUDGE BEAKUM mastered his countenance, for at that moment MR.S.T.
JULLIEN, one of the wealthiest New York merchant-princes, came up.

“Pretty lady,” he said, in the rich, sweet voice peculiar only to the old man, I’ll send you to the Tombs. MR. Potlucky is rich an
Italian and to the American, “may my devotion aspire to the next spin virtuous. I am his father, which accounts for it.” .
The PotlucKIEs inhabit the handsomest house in New York, and
a Judge of great celebrity, “that are two of the most distinguished among the Upper Ten Thousand.
The old man’s eyes opened widely, but the expression on the Judge’s
defied his scrutiny. After a moment or two of vacant staring,
MR. ST. JULLIEN led him into a charmingly furnished boudoir, where
three golden lamps spread at once soft light and perfumed incense, and
seating himself upon a white satin couch, demanded what he meant.
“I thought you was posted up,” said the Judge, “ or I would not
have mentioned it. My duty forbids my adding another word, except
assure you, in confidence, that POTLUCKY is to-night a beggar, and
will to-morrow be a prisoner.”
“And he dares dance with my child—my only darling—all that is
left to me of her sainted mother, except $3,000,000, her dowry.” And
with lurid light gleaming from his aged eyes, he dashed down a costly
crystal vase, filled with expensive exotics, and hurried back to the
gorgeous salon. The polka had ceased, and ALBINLA half reclined upon
the manly shoulder of HoRACE º with the exertion. .
“Quit that, and follow me, b noy,” hissed, rather than said the old
man, close at the side of HoRACE. M.R. St. JULLIEN had not meant
that ALBINIA should hear him, but as our immortal bard expresses it,
“a lover's ear will gaze an eagle mute.” The rich blood mantled over
her lovely countenance, and she pressed the hand of her companion in
speechless terror. There was no mistaking the scowl on that old man’s
face. HoRACE hesitated, and the next moment ALBINIA's overwrought
emotions mastered her. Unable to speak, she suddenly sung out with
the full, ringing note of the dying swan-
“Boston is a pretty town,
And so is Philadelphy;
You shall have a sugar-plum,
And I'll have one myself-y;”
And with a few incoherent words—as “WASHINGTON.—liberty—
PIERCE—” showing what is ever at the heart of a true American girl,
even in the hour of agony, she dropped upon the embroidered carpet.
HoRACE Potlucky dashed himself down beside her with a wild cry
of horror, which struck deep, even to the soul of the Judge. Did he
remember how, years before, in the trackless forest marshes of the Sus-
quehanna, a golden-haired girl—But why speak of memories'
The old man, roused to new frenzy, seized the elegantly cut collar of
HoRAce's well-fitting, coat, and sought to drag him from ALBINIA.
The young man looked up with a tiger-glare, and the glittering bowie-
knife leaped from his bosom. In an instant he regarded MR. St.
JULLIEN, as if about to annihilate him, but the next moment instinct
taught him who was his foe, and with a pard-like bound he sprang
towards the Judge, and dashed the knife full upon his heart. A shriek of
horror burst from all, followed by a cry of wild surprise as the well-
tempered blade flew into innumerable sparkling splinters.
e Judge drew a revolver. HoRACE PQTLUCKY felt he was doomed.
But his eyelid did not quiver, his cheek did not pale. He confronted
his stern enemy with an eye stern as his own.
“Down with him, Judge l’ shrieked the remorseless old man.

CLERKS AT STARVATION PRICES.
WHEN we headed an article the other day with
the words “Thieves Wanted,” we felt satisfied
that a demand for anything would always produce
a supply, and we are therefore not astonished
at a communication from a “Wholesale House,”
enclosing to us a shower of answers having been
received to an advertisement for an ill-paid collec-
torship. We do not mean to say that all the un-
fortunate §. men, whom dire necessity may
drive to the degradation of becoming candidates.
for a hard place at a beggarly salary, are posi-
tively dishonest; but we maintain that a task-
master who º for over-work at under-pay,
is not justified in expecting first-rate integrity
from men whose remuneration is out of all pro-
portion to the confidence reposed in them.
That a worthless situation should be eagerly
sought after proves nothing but the existence of
a class which is prepared to plunge recklessly
into the first semblance of the means of liveli-
hood which offers itself; and though the hopes
of decent subsistence may be dashed after the
experience of a few weeks, there will always
be a fresh supply of victims ready to embrace the
hollow delusion.

THE PESTILENCE AND ITS BROTHER.
As NICHOLAs, the other night, was sitting all alone,
Now smiling, as he fancied that he heard our soldiers groan,
Then cursing his own legions for their failures in the war,
The Cholera, in a demon's form, appeared before the CzAR.
The Tyrant shuddered at the sight: he thought his hour had come,
A shriek stuck in the throat of him : the AUtock AT was dumb.
So grievously did livid fear his heart and midriff wring; -
Or he had howled as a hangman howls whose turn it is to swing.
The spectre with its bat-like wings the quaking monarch screened;
“Fear not,” it cried, “my Nicholas, my Brother in the FIEND:
I love thee as AsprAMELECH doth tender ASMODAI,
Or MoLoch MEPHISTOPHELEs, or ZAMIEL ZATANAI. -

Ho! mo, no, mo, my fellow CURSE; to warn thee I am here.
As yet thou art, but flesh and blood: their tenure is but slight,
Thou mightest be where HERod is before to-morrow night.
“All in good time; meanwhile, thou hast a mission to fulfil,
More human creatures to torment, to ruin, and to kill; -
Unless mankind, whose foe thou art, against thee should combine,
And I fear they will, because they hate thy name as much as mine.

If Germany to physic thee united would advance,
For every honest German heart, as thou full well must know,
Abhors thee and thy Cossacks, as he hates the place below.”
“My CHOLERA,” said Nicholas, recovered of his dread, , ,
“The Germans whom you talk of, with the Prussians at their head,
Are slaves of slaves of slaves; I mean, of women, slaves of mine:
Small fear have I that Germany against me will combine !”

THE GREAT PIG QUESTION.
E have all heard of
the expediency of get-
ting up a “cry” for
election purposes, but
we never expected to
find the British Lion
superseded by that
much less noble and
far more disgusting
beast, the Pig, as a
medium for appealing
to the Pºiº pas-
sions of the º le.
Nevertheless, the #.
is beginning to be held
up as the animal round
which the Swinish
multitude are invited
to rally. “Love me,
love my Pig.'” is
taking the place of the
old invocation in
favour of the dog—
hitherto considered as
- the friend, we ma
add the honourable friend, of man; and “Please the Pigs' " º
soon be equivalent to saying “Please the Populace.” To prove that
we are not unduly depreciating the public to the porcine level, and
looking at a subject with an obliquity of vision, caused by prejudice
having placed a sty in our eye, we quote the following from a printed
address to the Independent Burgesses of Leicester:—
“GENTLEMEN, -You will in a few days be called upon to Elect fit and proper persons
to represent your Interests in the Council Chamber; and we would, on the present
occasion, particularly impress upon you, at all the Ward Meetings in the 13orough, to
ask the parties who offer themselves as Candidates. “Whether THEY ARE Averse
To THE KEEPING of Sw1NE, where. They ARE KEPT CLEAN.' If they object to
Swine being Kept, turn them to the ‘right-about-face,’ and tell them plump that you
won't vote for them.—One and all, stick to this, and you will find plenty of Gentlemen
who will come forward to protect your interests.” -
It is evident that the “Pig Party” is beginning to make itself heard
with a force of grunt that cannot be ignored, and the Leicester electors
are willing to accept one, of whom they know nothing except that “he
don't object to pigs,” though he may be a mere “pig in a poke” as
to their acquaintance with his general attributes. It is evident that in
the Borough of Leicester the pearls of health and cleanliness are to be
thrown away before swine, for “Pig or no Pig l’ is to be the question
proposed to all who ask for a vote, and rejection stares in the face of
the anti-hoggish candidate. We do not know where the electors are
to find a public man ready to throw himself into the arms of the Pig
Party, and the only way to secure an individual who will not set his
: against swine is to look out for some Bath Chap as a represen-
lWe.
LORD PALMERSTON WANTED.
WE lately saw in the papers a complaint from the worthy magistrate
of the Hammersmith Police Court, as to the unfitness of the building
in which “Justice to Hammersmith.” is necessarily administered. As
LoRD, PALMERSTON is a sort of Government Times, to whom, every
body is to write who wants an evil officially redressed, we take the
liberty of calling his Lordship's attention to the rickety old tenement
which forms the Hammersmith Temple of the Suburban TheMIs.
Supposing the blind goddess to have been set down at the corner of
Brook Green by an omnibus, she must grope her way into the Court
itself, which it seems is held in a small room where the magistrate is
almost backed into the grate, to keep up a º distance from the
prisoners, who, if the room were furnished, would have to occupy the
side-board.
As to the witness-box—supposing the room to be furnished—there
would be nothing available, but the cellaret, from which a “party”
could give his evidence; and the Clerk could only enjoy the semblance
of a partition from the general throng by the aid of the fire-screen.
As to Counsel, when they attend, and Solicitors or their clerks, they
must all be huddled up together in a space of some few feet square,
under the very nose of Justice; and as some Counsel are rather foul-
mouthed, the nose of Justice is not always treated to a very agreeable
bouquet. It appears also, from the complaint of the Magistrate, as
reported in the Times, that there being no waiting-room for witnesses,
they are, if it is necessary to order them out of Court, sent literall
outside, and frequently into the rain, so that when re-called to detail
dry facts, to form the thread of evidence, they have often not a dry
thread about them.
A glance at the exterior of the building has been sufficient for us,
and we have often wondered that the Police Court, which is the only
tribunal for the poor, should be made so difficult of access, that there
is nothing but an old tumble-down ladder—for we can hardly dignify it
with the title of “a flight of .#. get up to it. §j. said
something about some surveyor having done something or nothing, or
meaning to do something some time or other about some improvement:
but if the underlings are inactive, or there is an impolitic shabbiness
about the necessary money being granted for the accommodation of the
public, we invite the attention of LoRD PALMERSTON to the state of
the case, and we have no doubt the lazy subs will all quicken their
movements. In the mean time, as the severe weather is coming on, we
would suggest the erection of a large gig umbrella outside the door of
the Court, as a shelter for those who are waiting on business—there
being no accommodation within—and the umbrella could, of course,
be removed at the close of the business of the day, to prevent any
infringement of the law as to obstructions of the thoroughfare.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GAMBLING GERMAN GOVERNMENTS,
Y a printed prospectus with which we
have been favoured, we see that a series
of State Distributions will be made,
which offer the following advantages,
exhibited in large bold capitals—a species
of capital in which the speculators would
seem to be particularly rich, if we may
judge by the display they make of it.
“With a single Stake of £1 in the
Sardinian State Distribution, you
will gain £21,250 !!!
“With a single Stake of £2 in the
Hessian State Distribution, you
will gain £25,000 !!!
“With a single Stake of £10 in the
Frankfort State Distribution, you
will gain £43,500 !!!”
If £l will gain £21,250, we should like to know the extent of the |T
fund out of which the gain is to be paid, and we can but wonder at
the lavish liberality which is prepared to make such an “alarming
sacrifice.” The proposal reminds us of some of those very benevolent
Benefit Societies, in which a subscription of £1 entitles i. subscriber
to a pension of £10 a year—as soon as he can get it.
If these petty German States cannot go on without lotteries to pay
their expenses, it would be better for the princes to take bazaars at
some of the watering places in the Season, when the fact of a crowne
head presiding at a raffling table, or a princess giving whirls to a wheel
of fortune, might bring more grist to the German mills, than can be
obtained through these “State Distribution” dodges, which, instead
of bringing grist, excite only the “chaff” of those whose duty it is to
protect the pockets of the community.
WONDERFUL IMPROVEMENTS IN ENGLAND.'
IT is strange the extraordinary, improvements that have taken place
in England since the Alliance with France. It would seem as if the
Eastern Question had had the one good effect of opening the eyes of
French writers, for they have lately noticed things in £ngland, which,
either they could not, or would not, notice before.
Amongst other things, they have seen the Sun. They admit now
that the Sun is occasionally visible, in England. They are generous
enough to acknowledge that cucumbers are raised by it—that corn is
ripened by it—that photograph portraits are taken with it—and that
the Sun, which is said “never to set on the English dominions,” is,
after all, a real bond ſide genuine Sun, giving out heat and freckles,
and not the mere cold shadow of a Sun, borrowed for the occasion from
France, or the nearest tin-shop and gas-works.
The Climate, also, is endurable. People can actually live in it now.
There is not a fog every day of the year. You can see to read at noon
day. The atmosphere is likewise pronounced not to be so depressin
as it was formerly. Young ladies do not make up parties to go j
throw themselves of Waterloo Bridge, twelve at a time, Countesses

and they are green, and not black.
The decrease of “Spleen’’ is likewise most wonderful. It has

more rational; in a word, we are more civilized, since we went to
fight the Cossack. Every Briton has not, at present, a bull dog at his
heels, nor has he a prize fighter for his tutor, nor is he in the habit of
selecting his better half out of the kitchen. We do not drink gin in
tumblers for our breakfast, any more than we kill a crossing-sweeper
or two just, to give us, an appetite for our supper. It appears that
nous arons change tout cela.
Perſide Albion has discontinued being Perſide. He has now grown
brave, loyal, généreur ! There is nothing too good that can be said of
him. #. ships can sail all over the world without being suspected of
stealing continents, or of abetting some sable Emperor in his cannibal
propensities at the expense of the French; and the British flag can be
unfurled now in any French print without having a whole column of
mud thrown after it. Perſide Albion is now the object of French praise,
of French admiration. French ladies fall down, and kiss the tips of
his venerable top-boots—even his round fat belly is used as a big-drum
of honour on which enthusiastic Frenchmen love to beat his praises as
loudly as they can.
And these wonderful improvements have all taken place in the short
space of a twelvemonth ! We are not aware that we are any better, or
any worse, than we were two years ago. The fact is, we have not
changed, but the feeling of the French towards us has changed.
hey see us now, with very different eyes—the eyes of Allies. . This
change is all owing to the war, and we ought to be thankful to
Russia for it... The Russian cannons have done some good, for they

stupid prejudices that only mystified º and prevented the noble

or for a victorious year, or for a long campaign of continual su

numbered fewer victims this year than any previous twelvemonth. You
no longer hear of noblemen turning jockeys or policemen, because their
life is made miserable to them on account of the Spleen. It has ceased
to be quoted as a pretext for every absurdity that every English lunatic
out of Bedlam was guilty of. It is no longer made answerable for the
endless follies that our courts-martial and police-courts drag into print.
All our suicides and accidents are not put down any more to its
melancholy account. An Englishman can wear a white hat now
without its being said that it was “le Spleen’’ that drove him to it.
A similar improvement has taken place in our social habits: the
day when Englishmen got drunk down stairs, whilst their wives were
left by themselves in the drawing-room is apparently over. We have
dropped the fashion, it seems, of tumbling insensible underneath the
table, where we lay until our servants came in the morning, and
wheeled us home in wheelbarrows. A great reform has taken place
in these things, and in less than six months! . We do not bor in the
House of Commons—our legislators do not rise in the House of Lords
with a bottle of brandy in their hands. We do not eat raw bifteks.
We have given up the awful propensity we were so greatly addicted
to in all French novels and melodramas of taking our wives to Smith-
field, and selling them at public auction, with a rope round their necks.
We value them, we are glad to notice, at a somewhat higher figure

WE are not sentimentally humane... We know that certain suffering
must precede various acceptable sacrifices to the Mahogany Tree. We
do not turn from our lobster, though the manner of his death was
probably not that which he would, if consulted, have selected—we
dispose of our oyster, while the knife which broke at once into his
castle and into the treasure house of his life is still in the hands of his
burglarious assassin. , Qur eel, our shrimp, our coursed hare, might, if
disrespectful, say, hard things touching their respective erits from those

the table are not to be purchased at the price of downright cruelty,
and as such we cannot but denounce the treatment recommended by
M. SoYER in the following passage in his cheap Cookery Book.

A CAUTION FOR MR. GLADSTONE,
oMEBODY has been sending to the CHAN-
CELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER a
Mexican Bonds, nominally worth £500 each,
for a debt long due to the nation. We do
not know the real value of Mexican Stock,
but there is some Foreign Stock which is
worth about as much as a Mohair Stock, or
any other rag that might be used for con-
version into paper. We do not say that
the Mexican Stock is in this (state, and
indeed, for what we know, every £500 bond
may be at a premium, and worth more
than the sum it bears on its face, but we
only say that we have heard of some foreign
securities which have nothing of, security
about them, except the fix in which they
place the party who has relied on their pre-
sumed value. We dare say these Mexican
Bonds may be all right, but we should
advise the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER
for he may some day be having Railway
Shares or Bank Shares sent as conscience money, by which, instead of
obtaining an asset, he may be saddled with a liability.
MRS. GRUNDY TO MR. BRIGHT.
John BRIGHT, you’re no more than a calico feller,
You’re all made of cotton, like my umbereller,
You must have been, saltingly, spun with a jenny,
I'd own no sitch son if .# give me a guinea.
A Hinglishman's birthright, with sitch a poor sperrit,
Is what chaps like you isn’t fit to inherit,
If nobody else's heart wasn't no stronger,
This wouldn't be no land of freedom no longer.
To tell you the truth, 'tis my candid opinion,
You wouldn't oppose any foring dominion,
Supposing as how you believed opposition
Would cost you a few shillins more nor submission.
9ld Hingland would have not a soul to defend her,
If all was like you are, from Pope or PRETENDER
You wouldn't mind lettin
The same as it was with
the CzAR take possession,
e Papal Transgression.
But Britons won't never give in to invaders,
To please you, nor none of your Manchester traders,
Whatever John BRIGHT is, John BULL’s no sitch noddy;
So, therefore, now, let’s have no more of your shoddy.
PARSONS” PARLIAMENT.
(SPECIALLY REPORTED.)
Saturday, 1st December, 1855.
... Convocation metº for the first time since the exertions of
its promoters succeeded in obtaining its recognition by the Legislature
as the proper body for administering the affairs, conducting the reforms
and promoting the peace, harmony and efficiency of the Established
Church. Whe Jerusalem Chamber was the locality. The excitement
subsided, and several reverend gentlemen appeared with rosettes of their
constituents’ favourite hue, the Puseyites wearing the colours of the
Scarlet Lady (slightly paler than the original), the Irish Clergy generally
sporting Orange; while the Evangelicals patronised Black-and-Drab.
The fusion of the two chambers into one gave an additional feature to
the assembly, in the presence of the Bishops in their robes.
The ordinary formalities havin
proceeded to the election of a s er.
The Bishop of Exeter, in a meat, and sarcastic speech, proposed
the Bishop of Oxford, to whose judicious and persevering exertion of
his great influence in very º quarters, Convocation mainly owed its
existence as a recognised and working body. (Puseyite cheering). The
Bishop added a protest against any body who differed from himself in
opinion upon this or any other subject being allowed to vote or speak,
and suggested that such person should be excommunicated.
The Hon. and Rev. MR. Twiddle seconded the motion. One
WILBERFoRCE had been ".
wearers of black skins, and anot
er-sequitur patrem passibus aequis—
pºel of
to be careful in accepting all sorts of gifts,
of the fiercely contested elections of members has only partially
difference more
been gone through, Convocation
instrumental in emancipating the
had done as much for the wearers of black coats. He did not anticipate
that, they would have many differences of opinion (laughter), but
|should such arise, no man was so well qualified as the prelate in
question to prove that every man meant exactly the same thing, what-
ever his words might seem to imply.
The REv. BARNEY O'BRAwLER opposed the motion, and gave notice
that (D.V.) he should oppose every motion that proceeded from the
same quarter, both before it was made, and afterwards. Giving an
eloquent but somewhat severe sketch of the character and history of
Bloody, QUEEN MARY, and some biographies of the prentice boys of
Derry, the reverend gentleman denounced the Bishops of ExETER and
Oxford as disguised Papists, and proposed the glorious, pious, and
immortal memory of KING WILLIAM THE THIRD. (Hear, hear, and
the Kentish Fire.)
| The REv. BoANERGEs M“HowL seconded the motion.
| The REv. PETER BOBBLEs said they were talking nonsense. How
could the memory of KING WILLIAM be made their Speaker? He
wished the Irish clergymen would have a little brains in their zeal.
The Rev. BARNEY O'BRAwleR despised the insult to Ireland, and
itied the wretched Jesuit who could so pretend to misunderstand him.
is malevolence was helpless, however, for Jesuit's bark was worse
than Jesuit’s bite. He proposed for their Speaker that imminent Irish
clergyman the REv. TIMOTHY O'BLARE.
The REv. BoANERGEs M*HowL seconded the motion.
The WENERABLE ARchdeacon LUKER suggested that whatever
their private opinions might be, Convocation had better be represented
by an individual of discretion, who was not, to say the least of it, likely
to surrender any of their Wested Rights and interests. By no means
approving of most of DR. WILBERFORCE's doctrines, and utterly disbe-
lieving his orthodoxy, he thought him a safe man as regarded more
important matters, and should support him.
he REv. DR. High ANDRY assented to the premises, but denied
the conclusion of the last speaker. DR. WILBERFoRCE was an agitator
and a polemic, and what they wanted was a quiet, business-like, impracti-
cable man,who showed no zeal, and did only what he was compelled to do.
The Bishop of CARLISLE objected to anybody who, like MR.
O’BLARE, had ever spoken tolerantly of dissenters. He 'himself had
no toleration for such people, and had refused to consecrate a cemetery
unless a wall were built between the resting-place of the churchman
and of the dissenter. A broad gravel walk would not do.
The Rev. CLAPHAM FLABBY said that Dissent was to be lamented,
but Puseyism and Popery were ten times worse. He would much
sooner go and preach in a Little Bethel or a Zoar than in St. Barnabas
or St. Knightsbridge, or whatever they called it.
The Bishop of Exeter was, luckily for the reverend gentleman, not
#: º, or for that speech his gown should have been pulled over
is neaol.
The Rev. SILAs TRUMP begged his brethren to understand that he
set no value on a gown, which was but so many yards of serge. He could
preach as well without a gown as with one; better, in fact, in hot weather.
The HoN. and Rev. MR. Twiddle, the HoN. and Rev. M.R. TwAD-
DLE, the HoN. and REv. ALB CHAsubile, and others, rose to order at
this, and three young, Puseyite clergymen fainted away. After an
animated and personal debate, the matter º:
The Bishop of ExETER suggested, that if there were no more to be
.# they had better proceed to election. He hoped that the mis-
guided and unhappy persons who had opposed his nomination would
not think of dividing. (Sensation.)
The REy. BARNEY O'BRAwleh would not be dictated to, and would
certainly divide, and believed he should divide and conquer.
The Bishop of Oxford begged to say a word—only one. He was
perfectly certain that the reverend gentleman, who had been proposed
in opposition to himself, was every way better qualified than himself
for the office, and he should certainly vote for him (hear, hear), if only
to show that he did not consider the facts of that reverend gentleman
being an Irishman, with a broadbrogue, of imperfect education, of a not
entirely untainted character, and in embarrassed pecuniary circum-
stances, as any reasons why he should not represent Convocation. If,
however, contrary to his own wish, they should decide on selecting him-
self, he should try to do his duty, and an essential part of that duty would
be to afford special assistance to those gentlemen who did not exactly
think with him—most probably from having studied the subjects of
deeply and earnestly than he, alas, had been always
able to do. (Loud applause.)
The REv. TIMOTHY O’BLARE. The turrums in which me LURD or
Oxford has been plazed to spake of me are so preposterious that-
(Shouts of laughter, and confusion.)
Convocation then divided, and the numbers were:–
For the Bishop of Oxford . . 362
For the REv. M.R. O'BLARE . . . 151
Majority for the Bishop . . . Tºll
The Bishop was then formally declared the Speaker of Convocation
Militant, and the meeting adjourned amid great excitement.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI.
THE MODEL COURT.
| PUBLIC attention having
- been at length in
some degree at-
tracted to the long-
since mooted, and
daily more and more
important question
of providing the poor
with a better class of
dwellings, we under-
stand that the direc-
tors of the Crystal
Palace intend fitting
up a Court to repre-
sent the now exist-
ing state of archi-
H tecture, and internal
5 house economy, of
our lower London
and provincial city
districts.
The directors con-
ceive that by so
doing they will most
likely bring the mat-
ter to the notice of
a number of people,
by whom it may have
hitherto been con-
- - sidered quite beneath
it; and will also stand a chance of introducing it to certain duly salaried officials,
who in their capacity of overseers have completely overlooked it. The tors
likewise feel that the working man himself will the better, see the value of the
arguments for change when he has them put before him in a better light; it
being obvious to any one that the sunshine of Sydenham affords a clearer mean
of observation than the fog of the Metropolis. - -
Accordingly, a quantity of casts have been taken by certain duly qualified
employés of the Company, who have lately, at a great expens, to health. been
exploring what are generally alluded to as the “back slums” of Špitalfields,
Lambeth, Soho, and §. Green: and, as the result of their self-sacrificin
labours, a Court at Sydenham is being now constructed, which it is expected wi
#. a faithful copy of the courts that still exist in those so long-infected
Istricus.
The construction is not yet sufficiently advanced for us to do more at present
than detail a few of its principal features: but we believe that even these will be
received with some interest. in the Pompeian Court, it is intended not so much
to show the model of a single dwelling, as to throw together the most striking
parts of several: and in this case there will be a further advantage gained, by this
arrangement, as the want of uniformity, it will ensure, will represent, the more
faithfully that structural higgledipigglediness which so much prevails in the
localities it is intended to depict. - - - -
The first thing that will probably excite attention is the admirable ingenuity
which is displayed in completely excluding every possible arrangement, which in
the slightest may conduce to domestic comfort: and to show this the more clearly,
figures of the size of life will be introduced, and the inconvenience of four families
occupying what is really only space enough for one will, it is hoped, be thus
distinctly demonstrated. In their introduction of these figures the directors are
but following the course they have pursued with respect to the uncivilized tribes
of Central Africa; and it will be seen that in domestic cleanliness and comfort, the
natives of that region are but little behind those of Central London.
To represent the gutter which generally runs down the middle of our courts,
there will be a fountain placed in the centre of this, to play alternately with Thames
water and liquid manure; and it is expected that but few eyes, or noses, will be
found sufficiently acute to detect the difference. We also are informed that at the
tººl request of certain civic authorities a smaller fountain will be added, which
will be daily fresh supplied with an essence of the celebrated scents of Smithfield,
in which the wives ºdaughters of those gentlemen are, we understand, exclusively
to be allowed the privilege of dipping their handkerchiefs. - -
In order to assimilate the atmosphere of the Court as closely as possible with
that of its originals, engagements have been made with some of our most eminent
| |
|
|||||| | º
bone-boilers and gut-dressers for a continual supply of those highly noxious gases, :
which have so long kept in such bad odour the districts where their trade establish-
ments are situate. #. arrangement, and that, of the fountains afore-mentioned
will, it is expected, form the chief (nasal) attractions of the court: and will
obviate the need of any guides or finger-posts, as the visitor who may wish to
be directed to it, will simply find it necessary to follow his nose.
In order to ensure the most perfect mismanagement, we learn that the general
superintendence of the Court will be entrusted to certain duly constituted parish
authorities, who have had:great experience in local government, and are now
fully competent to administer its defects. When we add that all the sanitary
arrangements have been placed, under the control of a regularly ºft. Board
of Health, our readers will feel satisfied that no pains will be spared to keep it in
the most unhealthy state possible.
EXAMPLE TO THE ENEMY.
Is there not something mystical in the subjoined extract
from the Overland Friend of China 2–
“DEATH or AN OLD ENEMY.—TAu-hung-HA, the sanguinary wretch
who murdered so many of our countrymen at Formosa in 1842, and
who, despite SIR HENRY Porting ER's request for his condign !.
ment, was elevated by the EMPERo B HIENFUNG to one of the highest
posts he could confer, has met his death at the hands of China's
regenerators—the patriots.”
As this gentleman was HUNG, as well as TAH and H.2
we can quite understand that he was elevated to a high
post by the EMPEROR OF CHINA: but we cannot imagine
how he could have lived after that to be killed by the
patriots.
We hope that the sanguinary wretch who has caused so
many more of our countrymen, besides others, including
his own subjects, to be murdered, will ponder the fate of
TAH-HUNG-H.A. Great criminals are sometimes brought to
justice in this world, and Nicholas Romanoff himself
may come to be elevated to one of the highest posts that
an exasperated people can confer: whichºpost, may be a
lamp-post.
ONE OF THE GALLANT 93RD, AS HE APPEARS
AT ASTLEY'S. º
Instructions for Counsel.
WE really wish our friend BRIEFLEss, or some other
equally intelligent member of the English bar, would apply
to the Queen's Bench for a stet processus, to put an end
to the foolery of the Lord Mayor's Procession. ... We
should like also the learned gentleman to move for a
quo warranto calling on the Man in Armour, to show by
what authority he represents himself as an Esquire, and
if he is an Esquire, to shºw cause why he acts as a scene
shifter at a minor theatre dn ordinary occasions.

THE HIGHER CLASSES” ENCOURAGEMENT
SOCIETY.
SocIETY has been formed on
a principle corresponding
with that of the Labourers’
Encouragement Association,
at the late meeting of which,
at Romsey, Lord PAL-
MERStoN presided, and dis-
tributed prizes for good
conduct to meritorious
clowns. It consists chiefly
of members of the commer-
cial and working classes,
\ and its object is the encou-
ragement of industry and
economy amongst the higher
orders. Its first annual
º meeting took place yester-
- --- day, and the noble lord, the
member for Tiverton, himself, was one of the foremost of the distin-
ished persons to whom rewards were adjudged. To Viscount
*ALMERStoN, for length of service in the Foreign Office, and diligence
in his subsequent employment as Home Secretary, was awarded a prize
of five shillings. A similar sum was given to Lond John Russell,
for steadiness and sobriety in various and important ministerial situations
of trust, including the office of Premier. For administrative energy
and ability displayed in the capacity of First Lord of the Admiralty,
SIR JAMEs GRAHAM was presented with half-a-crown. In distri-
buting these prizes, the respectable President of the Society
MR., BRowNJONES, remarked that, of course, the sums bestowed
would, considered only in regard to their amount as the recompense of
a lifetime of political ſabour, be ridiculous; their value consisted in the
honour and esteem of whith they were intended for testimonials. The
following prizes were further delivered to deserving individuals of
property and station: to -
he EARL of HollowAY, for having supported his title and a family
of nine children upon ten thousand a year without ever having applied
for any favour to Government—a new coronet.
The MARQUIs of Acton, for having lived thirty years at Wormholt
Park, and during that time devoted himself to the improvement of his
estate, and never once raised the rents of his tenants—a double eye-
glass and a yard and a half of blue ribbon.
The HoN. MR. SYDENHAM, for having supported his widowed
mother, the Dow AGER LADY iſſuiwich, for some years, during which
the affairs of his elder brother were in a state of embarrassment—a
pair of dress boots.
CAPTAIN SweLTON, of the 110th Light Dragoons, for having always
lived on his pay, and private property without getting into debt—a
silk pocket handkerchief. The Captain produced satisfactory receipts
from his tailor, whose account, from the time of his joining the
regiment, he had punctually settled every Christmas.
§: REDward TAPEMAN, for prudence and savings during twenty
years' diplomatic service—a silver spoon.
he Lord Bishop of PUTNEy, who has got out a family of five
boys respectably in other professions, instead of providing for them at
the expense of the Church, for which they had no inclination: whilst
his Lordship has also devoted the bulk of his episcopal income to the
wants of his diocese—a Bible and Prayer Book.
The LADY ADELIZA MATILDA GINgham, for ten years' service as
Maid-of-Honour—a vinaigrette and a plume of feathers.
SIR JAMEs JENKINson, for eight years' service as Groom in Waiting
—a waist-belt and silver buckle.
LoRD BAGwig, for propriety of demeanour in the capacity of Gold
Stick—a pair of scarlet plush breeches.
MR. Bhown Jon Es then addressed the prizeholders. He said there are excluded from one ! 1 -
- in excluding these officers from the mess-room, it had better revert to

property and ruined his prospects. A noble lord or an honourable

were two principal rocks on which the aristocrat was apt to split. He

gentleman went to a race-course with a balance at his banker's, and
came back involved in difficulties which obliged him to mortgage his
estate. If such a person only ruined himself it would be bad º
but the reduction or break-up of his establishment also involved a
multitude of dependants in ..º. The same remarks applied to
gambling, and even more strongly: for the gamester's extravagance
served no useful purpose whatever. But though the Turf encouraged
the breed of horses, he would advise the nobility and gentry to beware
of the betting-ring; those who once entered it went on from one
thing to another till they were reduced in circumstances to the most
lamentable degree: and all this while they were associating with
blacklegs, swindlers, and members of the swell mob. But he was
ware that what he had just said would not affect his present hearers,
who, otherwise, would not have come there that day to receive the
:
rewards of prudent and virtuous conduct. He would, in conclusion
}. as a toast, “Success and prosperity to the honest aristocratic
abourer.”
The toast was received with three gentle cheers, after which the
prizeholders sat down to a light repast, and were regaled with elegant
modern French fare, consisting of hors d'oeuvres and entremels, accom-
panied by a plentiful allowance of sound wholesome Lafitte and Sillery.
THE JOLLY RUSSIAN PRISONERS.
How jolly the prisoner, who gets, for his pay,
From his captor's own purse, seven shillings a day !
And that’s how we pension our officer-foes
For which we shall certainly pay through the nose.
With nothing to do, lots to eat and to drink, .
On parole, it is hardines for them, I don’t think,
A sort of a life, which, to phrase it aright,
Is living like fighting-eocks barring the fight.
Of course crafty NICHOLAs—bless his mild eyes!—
Must smile with delight whilst he stares with surprise
When he thinks to himself—for the CzAR's wide awake—
Of the loss that we gain by each prisoner we take.
Well; let the sweet NICHOLAs chuckle and grin,
The laugh will be theirs who shall finally win;
We don't throw our money entirely away
In giving these men seven shillings a day.
By having been captured, in fact, they’ve been freed;
They bear our free speech; have our free Press to read,
A.find that with us to be prisoners of war
Ts simply to cease being slaves of the CzAR.
Each man will to Russia instructed return,
Having learnt what the CzAR would have nobody learn,
And amongst the poor creatures around him diffuse
Constitutional notions and liberal views.
Their heads, with ideas of Liberty stored,
Will all be live shells, midst the Muscovites poured,
Where Nick would have any shell rather explode
Than those that are charged with that species of load.
So, these things considered, the clodhopping swain
#. will not think he has cause to complain
That these Russians receive—within compass to speak—
As much in one day as he earns in one week.
The nation that prisoners so handsomely pays
The wages of postmen will probably raise,
And doubtless provide on a grand scale for all
The children and wives of our soldiers who fall.
WANTED–RODERICK RANDOMS.
SoME people say that the deficiency of medical attendance on the
sick and wounded in the East has been exaggerated. ...We should be
much surprised, however, if the following statement of the Times Black
Sea Čorrespondent were not to prove in every respect well founded:—
“I cannot conclude my letter without alluding to another just cause of complaint,
the effects of which are most terribly felt at the present moment. I mean the want of
Assistant-Surgeons. You remember, of course, the representations to the Admiralty
that they ought to be treated as officers, and mess in the ward-room, for circumstances
lave changed, and the Assistant-Surgeons, who were formerly chosen from apothe-
caries' boys, are now men who have passed in medical colleges, and received the
education of gentlemen. The Admiralty was shocked at their request; the consequence
is, that there are not a half-a-dozen Assistaut-Surgeons in the fleet of the Black sea.”
So, here is the fleet in a Fº mess, because the Assistant-Surgeons
the Admiralty is determined to persevere
the old system of selecting them from apothecaries' boys. They will
not be likely to get many other candidates for the berth of maval
was advertised for the other day, with some knowledge of dispensing,
to assist in the surgery, and carry out the physic. No glory, no respect,
no comfort, small pay, and a service of danger!—it must take a very
hard situation to induce even a surgery-boy to doff his buttons for
those of the naval uniform to be worn on these terms. Perhaps
Government will be reduced to the necessity of providing for the
medical service of the navy by forcible impressment, and we shall have
gangs of “four-and-twenty brisk young fellows clad in jackets blue
array,” waylaying respectable practitioners on their rounds, and
dragging them out of i. gigs and broughams, and away from their
brass plates and red lamps, thus compelling them to transfer their
professional exertions from the scene of a genteel neighbourhood to
that of a cock-pit.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“WELL! Becca ( ! DID You EveR SEE such A BARE-FACED THING As THAT * For To Go AND wear such Bon NETS As THEM
IF IT was ME AND You As DoNE such A THING, THE whole ALLEY’D BE IN A UPROAR.”
A BRIGHT IDEA CARRIED OUT.
“MR. PUNCH,
“PEACE at any price is my motto; and I am sure that any
price that we could have had to pay for peace would have been less
than the expense to which we iſ § put by war. . Of course, there-
fore, I say ditto to MR. BRIGHT ; and the opinion I entertain of
MR. BRIGHT's consistency induces me to hope that he also will say
ditto to me.
“In the first place, I think, with MR. BRIGHT, that the war was
unnecessary. I believe, as he does, that the fear of Russian aggression
was a chimera. This statement, being apparently absurd, requires
explanation. ... I mean to say that if we had let the CzAR alone, it would
have taken him a long time to consummate his scheme for the annexa-
tion of Turkey. It would have taken him another long period to avail
himself of the Turkish seaboard, to create a marine strong enough to
destroy our naval supremacy. He therefore would have hardly been
in a position to invade these dominions during the reign of HER
MAJESTY. There would not have been a very high ºft; that a
Russian invasion would occur in that of HER MAJESTY's successor,
who (after many years). I trust will be HIs Roy AL HIGHNEss THE
PRINCE OF WALEs. oyalty and Patriotism need look no further
forward. Two generations, and perhaps three, would have had to pass
away before England would become a province of Russia. Our free
institutions º not have been doomed to be destroyed by Russian
barbarism: our Press would not have been destined to be shackled,
nor our poets and our women to be flogged, and our reformers to be
sent to Siberia. It would have been the reformers, the women, the
poets, the Press, the liberal institutions of our grand-children or great
grand-children only, that would have been condemned to be destroyed
shackled, #. and exiled. The knout would have been appointe
to fall upon Posterity; not on our own backs. Besides, there was no
occasion to fear an invasion by Nicholas, even if there had been
reason to expect one. Suppose he had invaded us. He wºuld nºt
have harmed us much if we had received him peaceably.,. He would
only have made some addition to the taxes, amounting to less than it
§ cost us to fight him. Nay, if he had subjected, us to some
cruelties, the mass of suffering which he would have inflicted would
not have been so vast, and so severe, altogether, as that which must
attend these hostilities. No doubt it is very bad to be knouted;
º I had rather receive many stripes behind, than one shot in front
Ot me.
“Secondly, I hold, as of course MR. BRIGHT does, that all war is
wrong. I maintain that Christianity forbids us to defend ourselves,
and not only that, but also commands us, when attacked, to invite a
repetition of the outrage. Thus are we required to act by one of its
Fº literally understood. I understand it according to the letter.
f, therefore, as I was walking along Fleet Street, you were to rush out
of your office, double your fist, and strike me a blow with it on the
right side of my face, do you think I should knock you down? By no
means. Or call for the Police and give you into custody ? Certainly
not. I should only turn the left side of my face towards you, in order
that you might inflict another stroke on that. The same rule of conduct
would be observed by me in case of receiving a punch in the head, or
having any other species of assault and . committed on any other
part of me. Carrying out the same principle of interpretation, I not
only never defend an action at law, however unjust, which may be brought
against me, but always pay double the amount claimed ; and give awa
and lend my money for the mere asking. If anybody attempt to ro
me, I offer no opposition to him; as, doubtless, MR. BRIGHT offers
none, wishing as #. does, like myself, that none had been offered to the
act of plunder attempted by the EMPEROR of Russia. ...

| WHAT A LoNDoNER HAS REAson To BE
PROUD OF :
1 HERE are certain uliar
advantages and beauties
hat exist and flourish in
London, such as cannot be
found, perhaps, in any other
metropolis in the world. It
would be idle, impossible
to dilate upon them. Suf-
ficient, therefore, for the
purpose to give a shortlist
of their various charms and
characteristics:
In London, you get pure
milk-purer even than you
can get it from the cow;
and as for the water, the
lº, fact * * of º:
purity is, that the greater
jºrt of it is drawn from the
Thames.
In London, youhave the
pride of possessing a mag-
nificent river that may be
beautifully adapted for all
matters of commerce, but
is, perhaps, not quite, so
beautiful when viewed in
the other points of beauty,
adornment, health, and re-
creation. Still it must be
conceded that this same
noble river acts as a most
convenient cesspool to the
numerous factories that
overhangitscharmingbank,
besides officiating as a most
admirable sewer to the
metropolis in general-in
which latter capacity it is
well entitled to claim the
great honour of being the
largest Sewerinthe world!
In London, you have a wonderful City Corporation, that has the
enviable distinction of having stood up against municipal Reform
longer than any other corporation in the Kingdom.
London, and twenty miles even round London, you have the
enjoyment of paying, for the maintenance and glorification of that same
Corporation, a taxon everyton of coals you burn.
In London, you have a number of Church clocks, and other clocks
that enable one to keep an appointment with the greatest punctuality,

In London, §§ have a Lord Mayor's Show, that for several hours
every Ninth of November, clears the City of the tremendous business

fare of its crowded streets. -

streets where there is the most commerce, and the widest thorough-
fares where there is the least traffic.

In London, you will, also, see the few beautiful buildings, which
it has, placed in the worst positions, so that it becomes an ingénious
difficulty to see them without º our neck—and this is doubt-

naturally judging from the many bad buildings that are placed in the
most conspicuous situations of the metropolis, would rather be spared
pain and annoyance of seeing any public buildings at all,

that it becomes a question of courage, or the greatest urgency, to induce
you to pass over them.
In London, you have the further happiness as you walk out, or stop
at home, of listening to music of some kind, either vocal or instru-

In London, you will see in a stroll any day more beggars than police-
men—so that the wonder is their duties are not reversed, and the
beggars paid to look after the policemen, and to tell them occasionally

In London, you will see the street sweeping, and mud-collecting, and

In London, you have more frequent opportunities of studying the
anatomy of the pavements, with their various veins and arteries of gas
and water pipes, than in any other town, for if a second QUINTus
Quºtius were to take a walk from jºiºdily to the Bank, he would
find at any time plenty of chasms on his way, into which he could
conveniently leap, supposing he particularly wished at that moment
to save his country.
In London, you see, rising every week, stacks of monster buildings
defying every order of * and swarms of new streets built
without any regular plan, so that, left to the mercy of every builder,
and in that helpless condition that every plasterer who puts himself up
as an architect can raise his hand against it, London bids fair soon to
be balled—if it has not already acquired the proud distinction—“the
º metropolis in the world.”
º above is but a scanty list of the peculiar graces and glories of
our “great metropolis,” but, incomplete as it is, is it not enough to
make every resident proud of being a Londoner?
TO THE MEMORY OF CHARLES KEMBLE.
BRIEF as 'tis brilliant, the Actor's fame
With the spectator's memory lives'and dies;
Out of the witness of men's ears and eyes,
The Actor is a name.
A name, that seldom lastingº: can hold!
Within his country's records or regards.
He stands not with the º sculptors, bards,
Whose works are never old.
Yet some so much have stirred the common heart,
That, when they long have past from sight, we find
Memories, which seem undying, left behind
Of their so potent art.
Such Roscius was, the cherished of old Rome;
Such GARRick was, in our forefathers’ day;
Such, more than GARRick or than Roscius, they
Who graced the KEMBLEs’ home.
Who is there of us, old or young, but knows,
Familiar as one of his own race,.
The stately Sippons, with her sibyl-face
And statue-like repose? -
Nor less the Elder KEMBLE, he who stept
The true Coriolanus—full of scorn:
So Senators their togas might have worn,
Such countenance have kept.
Less grave of mien, of manners less severe,
And powers more slow to ripen, came the third;
Gay, gallant, debonair—in act and word,
The perfect Cavalier.
He top is gone, whom all his fourscore years
Had left with something of the youthful fire
That blazed in Falconbridge, and did inspire
Benedick's quips and jeers.
Where is Mercutio º' Where Don Feliz now?
Where Hotspur & Cassio & The Merry King?" *
Where that clear laugh that made old Drury ring;
That light step and bold brow?
He linked us with a past of scenic art,
Larger and loftier than now is known;
Less mannered, it may be, our stage has grown,
Than when he played his part.
But where shall we now find, u
The Gentleman in action, loo
Who wears his wit, as hew
As polished and as keen?
Come all who loved him: 'tis his passing bell:
Look your last lºok: cover the brave oldface:

LYNCH LAW; OR, MAKING A DOVE OF PEACE.
SCOTTISH GLORY.
Most people imagine that the Highlanders
distinguished themselves on the Heights. of
Alma by actually fighting with and routing
a large number of Russians. This, how-
ever, was not exactly the case, if we may
believe the following paragraph from the
Inverness Advertiser:-
“High LANDERS AT ALMA.—A friend in the Crimea
writes:– One of the Russian Generals whom we took
prisoner being asked his opinion of the English troops,
replied that they were all splendid; but that whenever
the Russians saw the half-naked fellows withouttrowsers
marching at them, they knew the day was lost, for the
savages came on with a yell that no human power could
withstand.'" -
We do not, however, believe the above
statement. It is our firm conviction that the
brave Highlanders really and truly bore back
the Russians at the P. of the bayonet, and
did not, as pretended by the Russian General,
frighten them away merely by their uncouth
exteriors and horrid screams. The personal
º: of the Highlander is ...
and his voice is musical; by these advan
he conquers in love only, and not in war. No
Russian is to be terrified by savages that
has ever looked in a glass, and Cossacks are
not to be put down by clamour. At the Battle
of Alma the soldiers of MENschikoff saw
nothing half so ugly as themselves. It would
be no credit to the Highlanders to have
scared Russians in the field, as if Russians
had been crows: and we wonder what can
induce the Inverness Advertiser to advertise
his gallant countrymen as a race of Guys.

GENERAL VIEW OF GREECE.

KNow'st thou the land where a sly press’s dirt 'll

And the lawyer’s their trusty accomplice in crime?

Where a soft head like Otho's the Crown could assume,
A. King, with the mien of an underbred groom—
Where the traders in feats of rascality vie,
Where they cheat if you sell, and they cheat if you buy,
And to list to a native's to list to a lie.
Where if trees (as we say) may be known by their fruit,
Qne's certain that Honesty never struck root.
Where their dastardly banner bears Christendom's sign,
In type that each fight is a Cross, we opine?

Exults in the hope that the Russians have won.

CLERKS AND CLODHOPPERS.
WHILE the Agricultural interest has been looking up, the Com-
mercial interest seems to be looking down, or at all events, it often
takes a very low view of clerks’ salaries, #very day ºl. us with
some fresh instance of the dreadful discount to which commercial
industry, ability, and .. have fallen. The Times of the 11th of
this month contained the following advertisement:
CHERK WANTED.—Wanted an in-door Clerk, to take cash and keep
a set of books. Salary £30 per annum. Address, stating age, &c. to the Early
Closing Association, Ludgate Hill.
Though we are advocates for “early closing,” we should be sorry to
see a young man, prematurely shut up as an in-door clerk at thirty
pounds per annum. If he is “to take cash,” it is rather a prudent
step to stipulate for his staying in-doors, as it would be putting his
integrity to a rather severe test, if he were allowed to be at large on
his miserable pay, with any of his º money in his pocket. His
proposed salary is lls. 6\d. per week, which is about 5%d. below the
wages of an agricultural labourer. At this rate it seems more con-
ducive to health and wealth to use a spade in the open air than to di
away with a steel pen in a close atmosphere. We cannot be surprise
that while clerks are remunerated at less than bricklayers' wages, the
criminal courts should now and then be called upon to correct clerical
errors,
AN EXTRA-PAROCHIAL OFFICER.
We must admit that MAJOR Powys, Hon. Sec. to the Widows and
Orphans Association, has shown himself, by his conduct, in the case of
ANN GoDw1N, to understand thoroughly the duties of a Relieving
Officer. As that conduct has been approved of by the Woolwich Qom.
mittee, we now #. what otherwise we should not have imagined,
that a Relieving Officer in the Army is expected to dispense charity in
the same spirit as that in which assistance is dispensed by the Relieving
| Officer of the Workhouse. , If...this is the way in which relief is to
be administered to Soldiers' Widows and Orphans, those Orphans and
§ will rejoice in the guardianship of a regular Board of
uardians.

A TRUMP CARD (IGAN).
AWARICE OF THE CHURCHYARD.
WE have often heard of the gaping and the greedy grave; and
always supposed that it * for, and was greedy of, only dead bodies,
and the valuables interred with them by social folly. It gapes, ac-
cording to the letter of “A Town CURATE” in the Times, for some-
thing more. That clergyman, after relating a case of sad distress,
proceeds—
“The sick person died, and in a few days the landlady of the lodgings applied to
me for money to pay the funeral expenses. The parish, she said, had done all it
could do—had given a coffin, a shroud, and means for the payment of half the neces-
sary fees, the poor neighbours had contributed their pence and halfpence, but still
there remained upwards of 5s. or 6s. to be provided before the burial could take place
- ... the girl was utterly unable to find the requisite money, the body could no
longer remain where it was; it must, as she expressed it, “be put under ground,' and
before the ground could be opened, these fees must be paid.”
So that the grave gapes not only for the poor remains of mortality,
but also for a sum upwards of twelve shillings: considerably upwards,
#. in some cases. For this money, however, the grave of course
oes not gape on its own account. It gapes vicariously for some mon-
ster—does that mean that it gapes for the Vicar, or is the Rector that
monster whose mouth ought to be shut immediately?
RUSSIAN DUCKS AND GEESE.

But they’re ducks of the sort that belonged to Mrs. BOND ;
What seas of their blood he has caused to be spilled,
Crying—“Bless you, bless you, bless you, bless you, go and be killed !”
To say they are geese 'twould º: be more right,
For such an unmerciful brute since they fight,
In whole flocks for slaughter by whom they are drilled, -
With his “Bless you, bless you, bless you, bless you, go and be killed!”

some of our contemporaries. We have not seen the Prospectus, but
we understand that the following is one of the papers which every
person will be required to fill up, who proposes to effect an Assurance
with a Company bearing a very similar name.

A Winning Throw.
|,THE Times correspondent says that our Riflemen lately met some
Russian soldiers in a quarry, and both being without ammunition they
commenced pitching large blocks of granite at each other. It is evident
from this that should powder and shot fail, the war will not be at an
|end while our men can get within a stone's throw of the enemy. Hos:
|. has evidently been brought to such a pitch, that the parties will
go on, pitching into each other as long as there is anything with which
the Allies can have a shy at the Russians.
ECONOMY OF WAR.
Political Economy says that supply should he proportioned to
| demand. If the same principle is observed in Military Economy with
respect to reinforcements for the Crimea, it will be found the best
economy in the end.
BREACHEs MENDING AT SEBAstopol.-We are told by the Electric
Telegraph that “the Bombardment continued, but the Breaches were
always repaired.” Certainly, those Russians are good tailors. º

THE “JUG" OF THE NIGHTINGALE.
The Poetry of Chess,
SoMEBODY has lately written, and somebody else has even published,
but we should think that nobody can have read, a Poem on Chess.
Perhaps, however, the theme may not be a very bad one, as the ground
work is chequered, and the characters are various. Church and state
are represented in the King and Bishops, chiyalry is, present in the
knights and castles, while the pawn is suggestive of the difficulties of
every-day life. It must however require a high degree of poetical art
to invest a set of chess men with the interest, that belongs to the
actions of men of a different, material. The only mode of treatment
that occurs to us is to describe the adventures of a king having lost
his queen, and being ultimately ruined by another mate.
GUNNERY PRACTICE.
THE three wooden Guns that belong to the Allied Army go through
their practice every night at Astley’s. This practice consists...in
entering at full 3. at the side-entrance on the right of the warlike
arena—defiling rapidly over the sawdusted plains that stretch them:
selves out in the form of an Amphitheatre at the foot of Alma—and
then dashing º up the platform that represents the steep
bank of that redoubtable river—only the river, as viewed from the
present Theatre of war, is not visible to the naked eye, or through an
opera glass either. After executing these spirited evolutions, the three
, as soon as they have reached the topmost height, wheel round,
e one, two, three times—being exactly the number of tubes of
which an Astley's piece of ordnance is º composed—and then
disappear with the greatest speed and enthusiasm by the Q.P.
wing of the army. This movement is necessary to enable them
to come on again as soon as, possible, and gº through precisely
the same martial exercise. It gives a capital idea of numbers,
and besides is a great economy of men and expense. After this
manoeuvre has been repeated with the greatest success two or three
times, the brave artillerymen retire to wash, out, as, is generally pre-
sumed, the mouths of their guns—the liquid they apply to their mouths
being generally a substance resembling very much in its appearance
porter or half-and-half—either of which is said to be very efficacious in
cleansing away the smoke that sometimes chokes them. ...A. good
artilleryman's pay rarely exceeds a shilling a night. In addition to
this, however, a certain allowance of powder is given to him, but on
the º above alluded to, every man is expected to pay his
OWI1 Silot.
The Two Great Movements.
THE two great movements of the present day are the tremendous
exertions of the Roman Catholics to extend their religion, and the
strenuous endeavours of all good men to elevate the condition of the
working classes. These two movements, so dissimilar, and somewhat
contradictory in their tendency, neyertheless do agree in one important
respect, for the object with each is decidedly a solemn desire to cele-
brate the mass.

the Church are drinking it.” The description given of the
sherry is rather clerical, for it is said to be “pale and dry,”
in which respect it resembles, those white-faced and hard
looking parsons by whom it is probably patronised. We
trust the “dignitaries of the Church” will not begin the
practice of writing letters to their wine and spirit merchants
to be used as puffs and advertisements. If the custom
begins we shall soon hear of the Dean of So-and-So's port,
or perhaps even the Bishop of Blank's brandy. It would be
a melancholy matter to the friends of the Church, if out of
pure good nature, the great clerical dignitaries were to
commence writing recommendations of wines, spirits, or
even beer, after the fashion now, so common among the
Peers, who are in the habit of puffing patent medicines.
We should lament to see a letter dated from a Bishop's
palace, and presenting a Bishop's compliments to Mr.
and-So, with a request for “six more bottles of that peculiar
cream gin, which had diffused so much satisfaction through-
out the Bishop's family.” . We should regret if even a
mere Archdeacon were to be advertised as sending for
“another º of that delicious dew from the top of Ben
Nevis,” which had been “highly relished as the foundation
for a good sound toddy by several of the Archdeacon’s
intimate friends and acquaintances.” It is possible that
“many of the highest dignitaries of the Church” may enjoy
a good glass of sherry, as well as other people, but it is a
little unseemly to find them quoted as an authority for
the wares of a wine-merchant. Some clergymen can ap-
preciate a cigar, but we should be sorry to see the
tobacconists’ windows filled with “cheap clerical cheroots”
as companions to the “penny Pickwicks.”
THE CZAR’s DEBT OF GRATITUDE.
We don’t think that the EMPEROR or RUSSIA ought
to send the order of ST. VLADIMIR to MR. BRIGHT. A large
order for cotton goods would probably be more in that
gentleman's way.

ADWICE TO CLERICAL AGENTS.
... IN a recent advertisement, offering a “Next Presentation for Sale,”
it was mentioned that “The incumbent is of very advanced age.”
This, of course, meant, that the reverend gentleman was likely soon to
die; so that hope deferred would not probably make sick the heart of
any holy man on whose behalf the succession to the aged clergyman's
income might be purchased.
. Dead men's shoes, however, have sometimes to be waited for a *
time. The living wearers of the shoes are old men, but obstinate ol
men, and won’t die. The mere age, therefore, of the incumbent,
affords insufficient information. It should also be mentioned whether
he is in an unpromising state of sound, health, or, labours under any
hopeful infirmity or ailment which might reasonably, be expected to
compel him shortly to resign the Church for the Churchyard. ... “Eighty
years old and afflicted with paralysis;” “In his second childhood, and
constitution breaking up:” these would be announcements giving a
speculator something to go upon. If the incumbent had an aneurism
of the aorta, or an ascertained disease of the heart, or was the subject
of Pºiº those important circumstances should also be mentioned:
and it might also be stated whether he was abstemious or given to
excess in port wine. - -

ANOTHER WAR WITH THE KAFFIRS.
Qur old enemies the Kaffirs have once more commenced hostilities
and declared war against the enterprising individual who has brought
over a small party of them for exhibitional purposes. The ement
with the Kaffir chief now in this country was, that he and his fellow
savages should appear, in their native costume, consisting of a few
beads and a blanket. Since the severe weather has set in, the Kaffirs
have insisted on adding trowsers to their usual jº. an arrangement
which, while highly conducive to comfort, is wholly destructive of effect,
inasmuch as a war dance in a pair of seventeen and sixpenny tweeds,
is deprived of all its romance and half its reality. The proprietor of the
Kaffirs has, it is said, consulted the authorities with the view of tearing
the objectionable garments from the legs of the Zulus, but it is evident
that º the slave is free when he sets his foot on British soil, he is
equally free to set his foot in a pair of British trowsers. We must
confess that we are disposed to sympathise, with the Kaffirs, on this
occasion, for we think it rather hard that they should be stripped to
the skin, in order that they may, as an exhibition, outstrip all com-
petition. In any event it is impossible that their trowsers can be torn
off by the hand of the law, and if they should thus be deprived of their
dress, it is evident that they might claim re-dress from the legal
tribunals of this country.

JIGS THAT ARE BAD JOKES.
WAR is something pretty. It is a light and elegant employment.
Perhaps we shouldn't say employment. Diversion may be the better
word. Suppose we call war a pleasing, graceful species of pastime:
for such it would seem to be considered by the world of fashion.
“Sebastopol—a new set of quadrilles, by D'ALBERT;” “The Anglo-
French Polka,” by the same Dancing-Master; “The Grand War
Galop, $º for the pianoforte, with splendidly, Illustrated
Title;” “The Alma Galop;” “The Alliance Quadrilles;” and “The
Bomarsund Quadrille,” are so many pieces of dance, music all adver-
tised in one column of the Times. To some minds war seems to
suggest the notion of such balls only as are set going by the fiddle
and the cornet with pistons. The cornet with pistols and the Minié
bullet would more naturally occur to others, and in tripping Sebastopol
and Alma Quadrilles on the light fantastic toe, we should think that
le of any feeling as well as fancy, would mentally stumble over the
es of the dying and wounded.
CHARITY BY PROXY.
MR. PUNCH observes, in the list of donations to the Patriotic Fund,
certain gifts, touching which he requests some little explanation. He
reads that divers sums are subscribed by Assurance Companies. Now
Mr. Punch, having done more for the good of the services and of the
fund than any person in the world, is entitled to ask out of what
moneys, these Assurance Companies pay their subscriptions. If the
payment is made out of the private purses of the directors and officials,
their liberality and modesty do them honour. But if the money is
taken out of the profits of the Companies, money therefore which ought
to be applied, according to contract, in increasing the bonuses, and other-
wise promoting the interests of the Assured, and of the Shareholders,
Mr. Punch begs to remind the particularly benevolent gentlemen in
question that they are not only being generous at no expense to them-
selves, but that they are actually robbing other º . order to: º: -
e a species of ~/
a show in the subscription columns. This wou
Assurance of so remarkable a character that Mr. Punch, if certified of
its existence, would assuredly bring out his own Great Moral Engine,
and play upon the offices themselves until all sham patriotic fire were
completely got under. Meantime, he will just trouble certain function-
aries, called Auditors, to get up the law of meum and tuum before they
are called upon to revise the next set of balance sheets.
THE PEACE SOCIETY IN EARNEST.
PUBLIc expectation has been somewhat º by the Peace
Society, which, it was naturally supposed, would display an activity
during war, corresponding to that evinced by the medical profession in
time of pestilence. Till very lately, however, no effort has been made
by that once busy association, tending in any degree to a pacification be-
tween the belligerent Powers. But a meeting composed of members of
the Society was, we are happy to announce, held yesterday, in the large
room at the Qlive Branch, for the purpose of considering whatsteps to
take with a view of effecting the speediest cessation of hostilities.
The Chair was occupied by ...
MR. BELLwerHER, who after dwelling upon the horrors of war, as
now exhibited and experienced in the Crimea, stated that the preven-
tion of those horrors was the object for which the Society had been
constituted. That object, however, had certainly not been attained,
and he wished that was the worst that could be said; but the fact was,
a general impression *. to prevail that, so far from tending to the
prevention of war and bloodshed, their exertions, in fact, had tended to
entail upon Europe and the country those very evils
been so anxious to avert.
which they had
MR. BARLAMB said the statement of their worthy Chairman was too
true. Their intentions had been the best, but good intentions formed
a payement which he hoped he should never tread upon. They had
proclaimed England to be a nation which had renounced war, even in
self defence, had turned its sword into a shuttle, and its bayonet into
a billy-roller, had yielded itself up altogether to commerce, and intended
on no account ever to fight any more. The EMPERoR of Russia
unfortunately believed this: the fear of #. was before his eyes
no longer: he gave loose to his ambition, and hence the disturbance of
the peace of the world. Considering the calamities which, they,
unlucky peacemakers, had been the means, however much against their
wish, of bringing on this country, he submitted that they were bound
to do their utmost to bring them to a conclusion... We were now at
war, and the shortest way to peace was to prosecute the war vigorously.
Hetherefore moved that a subscription be forthwith entered into by
the Peace Society in aid of the funds at the disposal of the Government
for carrying on the war.
MR. CAFFE seconded the motion. He agreed with the last speaker,
that they had been º noise that had brought down the wolf
on the fold. In fact, they had been bleating much too loud.
MR. Dovey said he wished their intentions had been as good as his
brother BARLAMB had described them; but he, for one, was ashamed
to say that although he had been, he hoped, to a certain extent, sincere,
he had, as a public advocate of peace, also been too much carried away
º a love of tea, of playing pretty, of waving handkerchiefs, of cheers,
of motoriety, and approbation, and by a sentiment of s
this account his conscience now pricked him, as he had no doubt was
the case with many he beheld around him. They had too much cause
to look sheepish: but it would be better to do their utmost to repair
the mischief to which they had so largely contributed. Let them now
contribute as largely what he might well call their conscience money:
* he would propose that they should subscribe an additional sum for
the sup
in º: to restore that peace which had mainly been interrupted
through the ill-judged agitation of the Peacemakers.
The motion was seconded by MR. CURDs; who expressed a hope
that Government would devote a portion of the new supplies which
they would be furnished with to the provision of larger Lancaster guns
and a greater proportion of Minié rifles to out the objects of the
Peace Society; and after singing God save the Queen and Rule Britannia
the meeting separated.

When §e Chivalry of

of Gaul -
In yon cruel Tartarvineyard
taught the foeman such
fierce warning f
Have we learnt no nobler
lesson from their valour
and their fall?
When our leaguer-brethren's leader with a cruel anguish stricken,
Scorned the down-bed and the pillow and the nurses' aid to die,
Was it only for a moment, that we felt our hearts' pulse quicken
And the blood rush to our foreheads and the lustre to our eye;
When with tone calm, but heroic, to his faithful followers turning,
Who, with sorrowing sobs besqught him of his sickness to take heed;
He smiling sweetly told them, his wan cheek with strange fire burning,
That “a Maréchal of France should die upon his battle steed;"
Was it only for a moment that the glow such proud words gave us.
Could warm our hearts to confidence, and nerve us 'gainst despair
Is it worthy of our name that we lament when foemen brave us,
And mourn that Vict'ry is not won unless we do and dare *
Should we not be shamed to utter such weak words? for they will wander
To our soldiers' Tartar watchfires, and before the leaguer'd wall
Of the Russians frowning fortress, is it well that they should ponder
How ungrateful hearts in England doubt their power to make them fall!
Should the Welchman’s bold battalion, which the sun of Albuera
Lit to such a field of glory, and to such a field of death,. . .
Whence its ancient laurels dyed in noble blood have issued fairer,
And to hear whose fatal prowess e'en the “bravest hold their breath; ”
Should the Guards of Royal England in their trenches gaily singing
Of the valour and the glories of the British Grenadiers, -
While their comrades' shouts of #. through the smoky air are ringing,
Be told that men at home are trembling with unworthy fears ?
Should our glorious Chieftain, he with eye so true and so discerning,
He who learnt his stern war lesson frºm the greatest of the earth;
And now in his life's evening with a soldier's soul is yearning
To leave a name like Wellington's for valour and for worth;
Should the Prince of Royal England, who with soul true to his station,
And despising courtly cavils, urged his Cousin on the Throne,
That as Prince no less than soldier he was one of a free nation,
And besought to strike a blow for England's honour and his own;
Should these gallant hearts be told that our hearts have grown so craven,
That their doughtiest deeds of daring cannot rouse us as they ought,
And that like the dismal croaking of poor Poe's unearthly raven,
We are crying, “Never more” shall fields be won though they be fought !
Nor alone the living hear us our manhood thus forswearing,
And forgetting our high kindred with the brave and with the true;
Pallid spectres on the rugged banks of Alma may be hearing,
And though they be dead, our hearts shall seem the colder of the two.
Gallant CHESTER little pondered when his country's flag he planted
On the stronghold of the foeman, and, his task completed, died,
That of hearts like his, so loyal to the death, and so undaunted,
We should dare to have misgivings, or to think except with pride.
Cust and ChEwton, who remind us that the men of noble breeding
Are as stern and stubborn soldiers as their brethren from the plough,
And the humbler dead beside them, must not feel their wounds fresh bleeding
. At the breath of our cold words, for they may hear them even now !
And our terrible war engines must be manned by hearts
unquaking,
Nerved by our prayers and hopes at home to do their
deed of woe . . -
With an awful resolution and with steady purpose slaking
Thiſ º ge for their brave leaders who were slaughtered
y the foe.
They must hear no cry or wailing—we want arms strong
and unyielding
As the metal of the cannon they are pointing at the
town :
They are smiling fiercely, grimly, as those great guns they
are wielding; , , -
Do ye think THEY deign to doubt those granite walls will
topple down?
For young WALshAM's spirit's with them—he their gallant
young boy-leader,
Who with fiery valour followed on the flying Russian's
rac
Till he perish'd at his cannon. Can they need a nobler
pleader - -
Anºleins his glory, can ye think they will turn
ac
Nor alone who died in battle have a debt which we must
pay them, -
They who sank in strife more hopeless with no war cry
in their ears;
And whose torments had no soothing shouts of Vict'ry to
allay them, . . .
Feel their martyrdom of anguish is blasphem’d by our
pale fears.
Brave old Tºwns, who but lived to add one chaplet to his
aurel,
Then died of the dread Pestilence, shall he have vainly
died ?
Shall much-loved WELLESLEY’s fate teach British hearts
no nobler moral
Than a *ing sigh of sorrow and a transient glow of
pride :
'Tis no time for looking palely, 'tis no time for gloomy

While the Alma's shouts of Victory are ringing in our
ears;
Solemn brows, but stern as solemn, hopeful hearts and
high proud glances

A JOKE BY A TEETOTALLER.
It is not often that a Teetotaller attempts a joke, for
it has been considered no less difficult to make a pun on
toast and water, than to manufacture a steam engine, on
the same flimsy fluid. A good sound joke is believed to
require a certain amount of stamina in the maker, and it
is therefore a commonly received opinion, that a jeu d'esprit
by a Teetotaller will be deficient in body as well as in
spirit. We are, therefore, º to extend much in-
dulgence to the juvenile effort of an ambitious member
of one of the Infant Bands of Hope, who, on hearing it
said that teetotalism was “Utopian,” is said to have
replied, “I think you Topers are far more Utopian than
we are.” As a mild instance of feeble-minded facetia,
this łº". point, may be considered almost as
harmless, if not quite so ingenious, as the Chinese anomaly
of fireworks without fire. -
Russia Holds on by a Rope of Sand.
It is rumoured—and we only hope that the rumour is
true—that there is “a deal of sand in the Russian gun-
powder at Sebastopol.” . This is all of a grain with the
wooden cannonballs, and the fortifications at Cronstadt,
which are said to be in many places, but little stro
than park-palings. . Moreover there is eyery chance for
the above rumour being true, for we know from experience
ſhow, all, Russian officials, in their dealings with Govern-
|ment, delight in throwing sand in the eyes of the
| Emperor.

SEBASTOPOL GEESE IN THE HAY-

THE ſººn...'. how gloriously

“ Down in this valley [the Inkermann valley] is a fine
flock of tame geese, swimming ou a pond near a house; the
owners have long since deserted both the geese and the
house. Many a longing eye is cast upon these geese, but
the risk is great; any one venturing down so steep a hill
to get the geese would run every risk of being caught by
the Cossacks, who are always prowling about the valley,
where we never venture.”
This is written, on the 2nd of November.
Oddly enough, all these tame geese, took flight
a day or two afterwards, and alighted in the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHO HAS SEEN HIM P
It has often appeared to us extraordinary that, in the rage now prevailing
for light and amusing periodical literature a little publication known as the Police
| Gazette has not attracted a larger share of public attention, as we feel convinced
that a man might, without º: make. grand tour without meeting with
a tithe of such, eccentrie individuals, both in dress and personal appearance, as are
therein weekly held up to public execration. We seleet from this charming journal
the description of two gentlemen who have modestly quitted their friends without
leaving an address:
“Escaped from Shifnal Lock-ups, on the night of the 18th instant, charged with Felony, Joseph
| Evans. He is about fifty years of age, five feet five inches high, light hair, fresh complexion; had
on a drab billycock hat, a brown coat, patched on the sleeves with a light coloured blue waistcoat
red neckerchief and fustian trowsers one hob-mailed half-boot. His parents reside at Bromstead-
| heath, near Newport, Salop. He worked lately with a horse at a village a few miles above Welsh-
pool. Information to be given to John GRIFFITHs, Police Constable, 26, Shifnal, who will pay
£1 Reward on his apprehension.”—Bow Street, october 23.
Can any of our readers predict how long the individual is destined to retain his
liberty, who is described as having escaped from “the Shiffmal Lock-ups,” dressed in
“a drab billycock hat and a brown coat patched on the sleeves with a light coloured
blue waistcoat, red neckerchief, and fustian trowsers, one hobnailed half-boot,”
for on reference to the punctuation we find the patches to have been composed of
these materials. ... We should imagine that unless his career had been ere this cut
short, the 5th of November can hardly have passed without his having been called
THE BATTLE OF GUY FAWKES DAY.
(Supplement to “The British Grenadier.”)
*Twas on the Fifth of November
The Russian Forces ran,
And long will they remember
The fight of Inkermann.
That day they were defeated
Of all days in the year;
That day they lost when they bayonets crossed
With the British Grenadier.
Our cannons did salute them,
In honour of the day,
o: *. º: them,
nd swept their hosts away;
We threw them shells for crickers,
They found our rockets queer,
But hand to hand they could not stand
With the British Grenadier.
*Twas very gratifying
To see them walk their chalks,
And think we sent them flying
In keeping up Guy Fawkes;
on to play a conspicuous part.
Their slaughter was tremendous;
Our loss has been severe;
But you’ll reinforce the ranks, of course,
Of the British Grenadier.
“PATENT ON THE FACE OF I.T.”
WE used to think that the lawyer who made a charge for
anxiety of mind, and trying to borrow money which he
didn't get, was a unique specimen of coolness; but the
individuals in Chancery Lane, who charge a shilling for
|looking for papers which they haven’t got, or cannot find,
afford equally good specimens of that amiable quality. We
hope our readers may not have occasion to make º:
application to the Patent Offices—though perhaps one visit
would be well repaid by an inspection of the ingenious
|machinery for raising the wind which is in operation there.

i. is the decision of the Court of Governors
that the thanks of the meeting should, on the contrary, be presented
to DR. JAcob for his sermon: for thus has that Reverend Doctor been
ruined.
The proceeding on the occasion of DR. JAcoB's impeachment appear
“with a wedge” in order to to have been not altogether dreary. A Member of the Committee of

regret that “people are of such slow belief.”
not have wasted space upon the above miracle merely because i.
narrative is a little more clumsy and audacious than the majority of
similar manufactures. There is a special class of idiots for whom pills
and puffs are made, and upon whom all argument would be thrown
away. They would but grin, and go away and swallow another dose,
and the box into the bargain, if recommended to do so.
But Mr. Punch observes something in this handbill which induces
him to request five minutes’ audience from the RIGHT Hon. WILLIAM
IEwART GLADSTONE, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and of the WiscouxT
PALMERSTON, Home Secretary.
The rubbish which the bill in question is intended to puff is sold—
more shame to M.R. GLADSTONE–under a Government stamp. It is
thus specially accredited and recommended to the ignorant, who think
more ". of any mess wrapped up in paper adorned with HER
MAJESTY's emblems than they would do of the same trash in a plain
chip-box. Government is not ashamed, for a consideration, to lend its
influence to the quack. But this is an old-standing complaint, and
MR. GLADstoNE, and MR. DisrAELI, and SIR CHARLEs Wood, and
MR. BARING, and LoRD MONTEAGLE, and a whole file of other
Chancellors of the Exchequer, have given, or been ready with the hack
answer that “the finances of the nation are not in a condition to permit
any sacrifice of revenue at the present moment.” This is the reply to
every proposition for reform, until a significant demonstration by the
House of Commons makes a different answer more prudent, and then
down goes the grievance. Some evening, no doubt, before the House
goes into Committee on some Ministerial scheme, the Government of
the day will be compelled to promise dissolution of its partnership with
the quacks.
But MR. GLADSTONE ought not, we think, to do more, by affixing his
Royal Mistress's Seal upon quack medicines, than recommend them.
We do not think that he ought, for the sake of the revenue, to
assist in discountenancing an invaluable preventive of disease, and in
discouraging obedience to an Act of Parliament, recently carried
through by his own colleague. In the very handbill to which we allude,
and which is folded round the “medicine” whose miracles it narrates,
the Indian Captain is made to say:—
“I attribute all my ailings, weakness, and diseases to having been bled once, and
WAccinated.”
There is no need, of course, to tell Mr. Punch, MR. GLADSTONE, or
any reader of these lines, that the Indian Captain comes out of the
same inkstand from which spring so many Yorkshire Farmers, Marine
Officers, Beneficed Clergymen, Ladies of Fortune, Retired Solicitors,
and other myths, who recount ludicrous cures, and give almost as
ludicrous addresses. But the doctrine that Vaccination is injurious, is
preached with equal mischief, whether a real fool wrote or a clumsy
quack invented the letter. And under the stamp of the Government
which introduccd the Compulsory Vaccination Act, most properly
enforced under LoRD PALMERSTox's direction, is circulated a notice
that all a person's ailings, weakness, and diseases may be attributed to
Vaccination. -
Are the people to consider PALMERSTON's Lancet as their Bane, and
GLApstoni’s Pill Box as their Antidote * We do think that they have
a right to complain of what Mrs. Malaprop would call the Vaccinating
Policy of the Government.

idea that his readers will think him a great liar, for he adds a sneaking begged to tell Dr. Jacob and that meeting that none of the Under-Masters had been
But Mr. Punch would selected but those who had brought with them as high testimonials as those of DR.JAcob
by the Times to have thus expressed his fine and gentlemanlike feelings
of indignation against DR. JAcOB:–
“DR. JAcob had also said that the Committee had not been careful in their selection
himself.”
Any one who has had the advantage of hearing an active Committee-
man of any Charity abusing one of the officers of the Institution, will
have no difficulty in imagining the inflamed countenance, and the explo-
sive utterance of bluff MR. DARBY. If MR. DARBY is not bluff, we
beg his pardon.
After accusing DR. JAcoB of concealing the truth and telling a lie,
the worshipful MR. DARBY is represented to have put the case
following:— d
“Now let him ask some of the Aldermen of the City of London what they woul
think of the official Chaplain of the Lord MAYor, if he had stated from the pulpit in
one of his sermons that not one of those same Aldermen had ever been chosen to fill
that office, because of his possessing any one of the qualifications requisite for the
discharge of the duties of it? (Great laughter.)”
What would an Alderman think of such a Chaplain, MR. DARBY }
He would think, aloud, Sir—the sort of Alderman that you contem-
plate. He would say “Bough-ough-ough? What?–ough ! What,
the Lord MAYOR's own—ough ough —Chaplain –ough 1–teach us
our duty –ough 1–servant—ough ough l—have the-ough !—impu-

Of such gentlemen as MR. DARBY’s ideal Alderman does the Christ's
Hospital Committee of Almoners appear to be constituted.
Story from Sebastopol.
GENERAL GoRTsch Akopf is reported to have said to CAPTAIN
FELLowes, “Pous m'ercuserez si jerous dise que rotre attaque du 25e

formed, was eminently British, both as regards its French and its
feeling. “Peut-être, Monsieur; mais mous anons seize mille autres beles

MODERN BARBERISM.
SoMEBODY advertises a pomade for the allied armies, “warranted to

we think it not at all likely that the gallant soldiers in the Crimea wili
trouble themselves about the mere turn of a hair.
Great Cry, but Little Wool. |

Cubs. “AH SIRE, IF THAT Is VICTORY, WE should LIKE To HAVE A DEFEAT THE NEXT TIME!”
THE BATTLE OF THE BUNGS.
THE author of the Great Taptutopolis may smile with contempt upon
his enemies. He still serves out his foaming small-beer at fivepence a
morning º to thirsty thousands. . His triumph, however, conveys a
most useful moral if men will only be wise enough to accept and profit
by it. In the first place, it shows the danger of education to the
Šišial mind; in the second, it marvellously illustrates the use and
advantage of a shake of the hand by a Member of Parliament. Nothing
can be more touching than the tribute paid by publican HoMER to the
licensed victualling editor. HomeR observed:- -
“He was a proprietor of a paper which had a circulation of 10,000, but in consequence
of having an editor who was a scholar brought up at Cambridge, but who knew nothing
of the practical working of a newspaper, it soon went down.”
A great warning this, to all ºriº of newspapers! Let them
avoid Cambridge and Oxford, and—if they want an editor—seek in
Mrs. Peachem's school for manners, in Hockley-in-the-Hole. HomeR
would further ask–
“He would ask where was the Age, the Spectator, or Wanderer, the works which
Steele, Addison, and Goldsmith, conducted? They were gone: those great authors
lived to see their papers die."
Now, the author of the Taptubopolis, not being a great author, would
certainly not survive the journal to which his shortcomings were so
particularly valuable. But our author is much respected by the upper
classes. Only to think it! Why, he is petted by the live son of a
live lord!
“To show the feeling in the higher classes, last week a post-office order was received
from a son of Lond Roorn, and a letter stating that he understood that the editorial
management was changed, and if that were so he should discontinue subscribing to it.”
This announcement made a very profound impression upon a meeting
otherwise disposed to be a little noisy and irreverent. How ER con-
tinued, like a master of oratory, keeping his grand fact for the last.
“Now, Ma. GRAN r mixed with the very elite of society. When he (MR. Homer) and
others of the committee went with Mr.G.RANT to the House of Commons, he (MR. GRANT)
had the honour of shaking bands with Mr. Osborne, MR. Disraeli, and MR. PETO."
This was too much for the victuallers. The Pig-and-Whistle fainted!
The Marquis of Granby flung himself into the Angel's arms, and the
Hen-and-Chickens sobbed on the bosom of the Mermaid. In the midst
of these profound and varying emotions, MR. GRANT was introduced to
the meeting astride a kilderkin, and the scissors of the Morning Bung-
hole returned into his hand: into the very hand that had been shaken
by an Osborne, a DisBAELI, and a PETO !
A BLOW FOR A PUFF.
. If anything would increase our sympathy with the sick and wounded
in the East, it would be the sickness caused and the wound inflicted on
our feelings by the disgusting attempt of certain, puffing tradesmen to
make a profit out of the sufferings of our soldiers. The low-priced
tailors, who always take the lead in any assault on the pockets of the
public, have endeavoured to tack themselves on to the skirts of the Allied
Armies by advertising a quantity of what they call Crimea Cloaks,
Balaklava Wrappers, and Alma Qvercoats. Considering that gallantry
is not a quality for which the tailors, as a body, enjoy any very great
credit, we are rather surprised at the impudence with which some of
the º have ventured to mix up their names with “the brave
men who suffer in their country's cause,” for we never heard of a tailor
being made to bleed except by his non-paying customers.
As our readers will doubtless share the disgust we have felt at
reading Tailors' advertisements headed with such clap-traps as “the
Sick and Wounded at Alma;” we think it scarcely necessary to point
out that the best mode of punishing this offensive mode of puffing is to
deal with its authors by not dealing with them in any shape whatever.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI. 225
THE MATRI MONIAL INSTITUTION.
We have before us at
the present moment two
rather interesting docu-
ments—the one, a pro-
spectus of the “Matri-
monial Institution, John
Street, Adelphi,” and the
other a police report,
rofessing to throw some
ight, on the mode in
which the business of the
Institution is conducted.
The prospectus com-
plains of public opinion,
which “withholds from
womantheright to which
equality of intellect enti-
tles her, viz., that of
making choice of a com-
panion, and of giving
expression to that choice
when made.” The pro-
fessed object of the In-
stitution is to enable
woman “to ask and to
have” any male “com-
ion” she may take a
ancy to. This object is
to be effected by “a safe
speedy, and successful
mode whereby parties
may be brought to-
gether”—a mode which is exemplified in the police report to which we have
alluded. From this it appears that a young spooney in want of a wife was required
to pay down a sum of £10 for the privilege of an introduction to a “nicely
dressed and tolerably good looking }. waving a white handkerchief as a
“signal” in St. James's Park, opposite the Duke of York's Monument.
The young spooney felt rather dissatisfied with the result, and sought another
interview, which he was told by the secretary could only be arranged in the
usual “safe, , and successful mode.” by a farther payment of money. The
º: “spooney” upon this confessed his folly to a friend not so green as imº
but still sufficiently green to hope for the immediate return of the £10, a demand
for which was met by “a violent personal attack” upon him by one of the
“officials” of the institution. This led to an application at Bow Street for a
warrant, which was no sooner granted than, according to the report in the Times,
“the matter was arranged by the repayment of the £10—probably to prevent
publicity.” So much for the case in point, and now as to the general Rules of
the Institution, of which we have a printed copy before us.
RULE 1. Provides that “the Institution be conducted with the strictest confi-
dence towards both sexes, so that the delicate sensibilities of the most modest lady
will receive no shock.”
We can readily believe that there is not much to try the nerves of the ladies
with whom the Institution has to deal, and that the “delicate sensibilities” of that
“most modest lady” who waved a white handkerchief as a signal in St. James's
Park, were not in the least shocked by the apparition of the young spooney who
}: paid £10 for the privilege of an interview at the foot of the Duke of York’s
Olulull.
RULE 2. Provides very prudently against “the annoyance of the curious” by
requiring five shillings, as a registration fee,” before anyone is “entitled to an
interview with the Director.”
RULE 3. Limits the º of the Institution to parties who are “respect-
able” and professes to limit the charge to the registration fee, “until a successful
selection takes * ”—a limitation which seems to be at variance with the alleged
ayment of £10 for a mere interview with an apparently anything but “select”
emale party at the foot of the Duke of York’s Column.
RuLE 4. Provides for the payment of all letters, a regulation that must be
satisfactory to MR. Rowland, HILL, as it prevents the loss of revenue that might
arise if the Post-office had nothing but the “Institution” to look to for postage.
RULE 5: Prescribes a form of application which must contain the “age, size,
wealth, sphere, &c., of each applicant,” and contains a promise, that “on no
consideration are the names or residences of parties given up until they are both
satisfied that their respective circumstances and positions correspond.” It is to
be presumed that when both are “satisfied” if both have been duped, “their
º circumstances and positions” may be considered to “correspond,” and
each may then know who is the other fool in the transaction.
RULES 6 AND 7. Provide, among other matters, for placing in the hands of the
Director “an envelope sealed, and containing the real name and address, which
will only be opened after all the preliminary proceedings have been discussed, thus
securing secrecy and honourable conduct.” We are not told whose “secrecy” is

thus secured, but when there are two parties to a transaction, one of whom is a
fool and the other º else, the fool will be quite
as likely as the other to hold his tongue about the matter.
RULE 8. Gives any lady or gentleman the privilege of
forwarding a portrait to the Director, who “will only show
it to interested parties, after which the same will be
returned any time when required.”
This seems to us the only really valuable part of the
whole scheme, for the portraits, sent under such circum-
stances, would be likely to form such a gallery of remark:

And stave your serfdom off without my stir,
Then you’ll rejoice that you hadnought to pay,
whilst youthankme, gratefully bless HER.
But curse me not, of liberty if stripped,

You have to meekly kiss the Kalmuckrod.
Still, if my memory must endure your hate,
With resignation I accept the doom,
I shall not fear your vengeance, then too late,
Norfeel my ignominy in the Tomb.
A Difference between Father and Mother.
... THE German language has both its “Fatherland” and
its “Mother-tongue.” The difference observed between
the two sexes is (says an old bachelor) in the above
instance both a wise and profound one. The “Land”
is clearly given to a “Father” because he is a man, and
we know it is the province of Man in a country generally
to hold the “Land;...", but the “Tongue” is expressly
given to a “Mother” because she is a Woman, and it is
well known that if Woman is a greater adept in one thing
than in another, it is in holding her tongue.

SHAKSPEARE PROTECTION SOCIETY.
LoBSTERs and cod-fish have been feelingly
talked of as creatures worthy of protection.
Eels have met with sympathy. Therefore,
then, should poets be suffered to remain objects
of the most barbarous persecution? The name
and fame of great bards ought to be respected,
venerated as among the dearest national posses-
sions. We are happy to say that this deep, this
serious truth is fast possessing many influential
persons, and the result is the formation of a
Society for the Protection of ShaksPEARf.
This society has, it is said, been quickened into
existence by the alarming report that Me.
CHARLEs KEAN is at this moment about to put
in an appearance as Cardinal hºolsey! The play
of Henry the Eighth has been rehearsed at the
Princess's under the most solemn pledge of
secresy on the {. of the company, and with
closed doors. Nevertheless, the intentions of
MR. CHARLEs KEAN have become known, and
it is said the Society for the Protection of Shak-
speaRE have at length determined to act with
all the vigour demanded by the extremity of the
Case.
De Bello Anglo-Gallico.
It is well known that the EMPEROR Nicholas
not only is anxious to pass as a great Com-
mander, but also is ambitious to be looked upon
as a mighty historian. In this way, when he is
not wielding his sword, he flourishes his pen in
the service of his country, and busies himself in
writing graphic accounts of the war in the
Gazette de St. Petersbourg and the Invalide
Russe. In fact, a good title for the latter would
he the “Czar's Commentaries,” and we have no
doubt it will be re-issued in some such form for
the use of Russian schools, as something superior
to CAESAR’s. |
The Black Sea Reviver.
THE success of the Siege of Sebastopol would
preserve the Black Sea in its natural colour, and
revent it from being rendered a Russian Lake, or
armine, by being crimsoned with any more of
the CzAR’s Sinope massacres.
CHEAP HOSPITALITY AMONG THE CLERGY.
THE Eraminer of last week, called attention to a delicious bit of
º in the person of the Master of the Temple, who appears to
e no less than “five single gentlemen rolled into one,” if our contem-
porary has given an accurate list of the reverend individual’s appoint-
ments. He was already Master of the Temple, Canon of St. }.
Lord Almoner's Professor of Arabic at Cambridge, and Rector of
Thurfield, when the Lord Chancellor—perhaps with the view of trying
the extent of clerical endurance, and ascertaining how much a poor
clergyman can really bear—thrust upon him a stall in Rochester
Cathedral.
That the Master of the Temple has not sunk under the burden,
will be satisfactory to his friends, who—if he has a separate set of
acquaintances for each of his several characters must be a very
numerous body.
It has occurred to us that one, advantage of this personal pluralism
will be found in the facility it will afford for enjoying the pleasures of
society at a cheap rate, or at all events getting a character for hospi-
tality, without resorting to that extravagant outlay which is the great
bane of the social habits of the present day, and renders it necessary
for moderate people to live apart, or go to ruin amid the wreck of
jellies, the popping of champagne corks, and the unpaid, bills of wine-
merchants and pastrycooks. As nobody thanks º for a plain
dinner, and as everybody feels it necessary to outdo his neighbour
in living, beyond his income for the sake of display, the Master
of the Temple may deem himself fortunate that he combines in
his own person the materials for giving a flºº, without
admitting a single stranger to his house, and that he sits down
at his own table with a party sufficiently distinguished to entitle
his entertainments to a place in the Fashionable Intelligence of a
newspaper.
We subjoin a specimen of an article for the Morning Post:-
“ INTERESTING CLERICAL REUNION.
“One of the most interesting Réunions that we have lately heard of
took place a few days ago, when the Reverend Master of the Temple
entertained a select party of clerical dignitaries at his London residence.
The entertainment was given in honour of the recent presentation of
a stall in Rochester Cathedral to the newly appointed Canon. The
guests present were the Lord Almoner's Professor of Arabic at Cam-
bridge University, one of the Canons of St. Paul’s, the Rector of
Thurfield, and the Canon of Rochester Cathedral. The Master of the
Temple occupied the chair, and in proposing, after dinner, the usual
toast of Church and State, he made some very serious reflections on -
‘the unhappy divisions in the Church—divisions he was glad to see
which were not participated in by the present company, which presented
a charming spectacle of Clerical unity.”
“The health of the newly-elected Canon of Rochester Cathedral
having been drunk, the Reverend Gentleman returned thanks with much
emotion, and expressed a hope that the same unity which had always
existed between the other reverend dignitaries then present would not
be disturbed in consequence of his having joined them, but that they
would rather feel renewed vigour from the connection, on the ground
that ‘Union is Strength.”
“After some further compliments and congratulatory observations
having passed, tea was announced, and the company rose as one man.”
A Case ſor the Knout.
To a classical mind there may be alleged one excuse for some of the
flogging which Nicholas may administer to his officers and editors.
Their despatches and statements abound with the grossest false
quantities.

“THE SENTINEL OF THE ALMA ’’ (IN THE
HAYMARKET.)
MR. PUNCH has received the subjoined letter from a private serving
under CAPTAIN John BALDw1N Buckston E, of the Haymarket Dull-
shooters: and—inserting it as in Punch's duty bound—cannot but
express sympathy with the gallant fellow put upon such foolish
and wicked service, as the actions of the 18th, 20th, and 21st instant.
“HonourED SIR-I am an old (stage) soldier, and have been, in
many scenes of action; but, honoured Sir, I have never been called
j. to serve so shabbily as on the 18th instant, as Sentinel of the
//tat.
“The action began about a quarter to ten. . The weather was very
hazy; and after the Russian general and his niece had talked for five
minutes, the fog was so great-in consequence of the talk—that they
could not see one another's heads. This feint made no effect; when
the scene of operation changed—and I came upon the field, telling the
field about me that my name was TIPPERARY TIM, and at the same
time, comically—for I was ordered to be ‘comic ;’ ordered, Sir, by the
eral who planned the campaign, who, if not aflover of his country is,
am sure, an immeasurable Lover of Himself—comically, as I said,
brushing my master’s coat.
“Of course, honoured Sir, being a sentinel, I sang a song—but that

his duty; and I went on firing away, blushing the while at the rascally
ammunition and the piece altogether. I have been in many stage
actions, but I never felt as I felt on the deplorable 18th. Only think,
Sir, of loading and firing a honeycombed, gun that you expect to go to
smithereens with every discharge ' . And yet I stood to it. . Yes, Sir,
I rammed in and fired off I don’t know how many shots of the late
Joseph MILLER of comic memory; but they all fell short. I knew
my only chance of taking the audience was by dash; but it couldn’t be
done. Boxes, pit, and gallery opened upon me, and their shot hissed

that moment. I assure you I wished myself in bed, or in any other place

his fire, and I had to discharge jokes at the cannon-balls that rolled
about me; jokes that, I thought they ought to have hired the ape of
the Zoological Gardens to crack, and not a real, live human man.

UN-PATRIOTIC WESTMINSTER.
WHILE every place in the kingdom is forming its Committees and
collecting .#. for the Patriotic Fund, it is naturally to be
expected that Westminster—the seat of the Aristocracy, and as the
late Mr. George Robins used to say, “the abode of royalty”—would
have taken the lead in the Great National Movement. A meeting was
announced, and the appointed day came, when the citizens were invited
to assemble in St. Martin's Hall, which it was thought by some would
hardly prove equal in size to the truly great occasion. The hour of
meeting arrived, but as nothing else had arrived, except a cab or two
with some of the officials of the city, the Hall was quite empty at the
moment when it was expected to have been crammed to suffocation
with an ardent crowd of Westminster patriots. In this emergency the
High Bailiff rushed upon the platform, and addressing the vacant space
made a few observations on the weather, which, being rather wet, had
probably kept away the patriots. It is fortunate that the rain, which
d the ardour of generosity at home, has not a similar effect on
the bravery of our soldiers abroad, who fought the Battle of Inkermann
under an amount of moisture—to say nothing of the fire-which would
have sent the Citizens of Westminster flying for shelter under the
nearest archway.

• THE CURATE’S UNIFORM.
MUCH question has been raised of late concerning ecclesiastical cos-
tume, but there can be no doubt as to the propriety of an improvement
in that particular, which we have to suggest, bespeaking, first, attention
ºvertisement ensuing, which has appeared in the Ecclesiastical
azeºte :-
ANTED, a GRADUATE of OXFORD or CAMBRIDGE, in Full
Orders, of sound Evangelical opinions, with some experience and a good voice, for
an Agricultural Parish of 700 inhabitants. Two Full Services, Occasional Duty, Pas-
toral Visiting, and attendance in Schools. A knowledge of Church Music, and a wil-
lingness to impart it to a Choir, already partially instructed, very desirable... Remune-
ration, £90 a year, with a very small cottage, partly furnished, and free of all charges,
taxes excepted, but fit only for a single man, or one without a family.
Apply to the Rkv. G. M., 7, Bath Street, Bath.
Now, then, we propose that certain alterations should be made in the
apparel of Curates. The waistcoat as usually worn, indeed we would
have retained, together with the cravat, for distinction's sake; but the
frock discarded. Instead of that garment, let the Curate wear a coat,
which in . of cut shall resemble that of a Bishop, but shall be
distinguished therefrom by an addition presently to be specified. The
trousers also, and boots, shall be relinquished, and the Curate shall
wear knee-breeches and stockings, such also as a Prelate wears, save
only as to the material of those nether garments, the former whereof
shall be of a coarser description of cloth, and the latter shall consist of
cotton. The clothing of the Curate's lower extremities shall be com-
pleted with a pair of long-quartered shoes, buckled beneath the instep.
And here it may be mentioned, that the superfluity whereby the coat
shall demonstrate that a Curate and not a Bishop is the wearer, shall
be that species of ornament which is fashionably styled an epaulette, but
called in the Saxon vernacular, a shoulder-knot. This embellishment
will not only prevent anybody from confounding Bishops, and Curates,
but will likewise hinder º persons from mistaking the latter for
reverend gentlemen, simply so called. It will denote them to be such
only in the sense of being reverend gentlemen's reverend, gentlemen;
it will, in short, indicate that the raiment which it is affixed on is a
suit offivery. - -
The Livery must, of course, be black, in order that it may preserve
the character of the cloth: and for the same reason, it is not recom-
mended that the breeches should consist of plush; but powder might
be worn in the hair with great propriety. That a Curate out of place
should appear in this trim would be unadvisable, because that might
prevent him from being hired; but the garb would be becoming so long
as he is in service; as showing that he stands in the relation of a
menial servant to his master.
Is there not many a butler, cook, valet, who would turn up their
noses—if Nature had not done that already—at wages of £90 a year?
As to the little partly-furnished cottage offered in addition, by how
much does such houseroom exceed the accommodation which the owner
of a park affords the man at the lodge? It falls short of that, indeed,
by being subject to the calls of the Government and the Parish; so
that the occupant would not exist in that happy ignorance of the nature
of taxes º by the majority of lackeys. Only he would not be
called upon for Income-Tax. -
Some people may think somewhat of Full Qrders, and estimate sound
Evangelical opinions at a high rate; the higher, if matured by some
experience, and accustomed to be preached with a good voice. But
what is the value of these qualifications more than that of civility of .
deportment, bodily alacrity, length of previous service, and a good f
character from the last place? As much as £90 exceeds a superior
footman's wages. Two Full Services, Occasional Duty, Pastoral
Visiting, and Attendance on Schools, may be, morally speaking, more #
elevated employments than waiting at the breakfast and dinner-table,
cleaning boots and shoes, going errands, and attendance on the foot-
board, but their worth in the labour-market does not appear to be
much higher. A knowledge of Church music, too, and a willingness
to teach it, are made apparently little more account of than the ability
to drive, and the readiness to be generally useful. Certainly the situa-
tion altogether is “fit only for a single man, or one without a family.”
Why did not the advertiser say, “without encumbrance.”
If the social dignity of service is to be measured by its average remu-
neration, undoubtedly the situation of a curate must be regarded as
menial. Let the Curate, therefore, be attired as a servant in livery;
ecclesiastical livery: but still livery. Call him, if you like, a reveren
Flunkeys. Very well; let him behave as such, and in time he may come
to be a Bishop. In the meanwhile, let him ride behind the carriage of
his master, the Rector, to Church: or, if his master does not ride, let
him follow him to Church on foot, with a long cane in one hand, and
the sermon-book in the other.
OUR SOVEREIGN LADY THE QUEEN
Is terribly taken to task by the very pious and exceedingly bilious
editor of the Record. HER MAJESTY, it is well known, gave attentive
ear and ºf looks to the band of the French Guides laying at
Windsor Castle on a certain Sunday. Well, the editor of the Record
declares he will not endure it! No. he shall be very sorry to be driven
to such an extremity, but—if it must be—he will lay hold of any of the
pillars he can put his hands upon about Windsor Castle, and bury himself
and the whole House of GUELPH (with supplementary governesses and
nursery-maids) in the ruins first, ere he will permit the Sabbath to be
again broken by wind instruments. There!, And now, HER MAJESTY
knows the Record's mind; and a terrible bit of sulphur it is. The
}; King and Louis NAPOLEoN are pathetically put together by ou,
Cord. - º

“We have no doubt that the music of the French Guides is far superior to the cornet,
flute, harp, sackbut, and dulcimer, which were listened to by the King and his prime
ministers on the plains of Dura: but counterpoints, mezzo-ſorte, and mezzo-piano, will
do little, we fear, to justify an open breach of the commandment of God, or to make H.
listening to opera-music on the Lord's-day a fitting employment for our rulers, when
a world is rushing to arms, and every post is bringing us the solemn tidings of
bloodshed and death.” º |
...The withering satire that contrasts the cornet and the sackbut, burns f
like point of lighted lucifer, and has as *. odour. Nevertheless,
the Record, amidst this trumpeting and shrieking of brass, finds matter
for rejoicing; but only after he has coupled NERo with Victorial lº
“NERo fiddled whilst Rome was burning. We rejoice to think of the inverse contrast F
between our QUEEN and PRINCE, and the Roman parricide. And we are pained all the
more at this solitary resemblance.” º!.
The QUEEN and the PRINCE are, ordinarily, unlike the Roman
monster; nevertheless, on a certain Šunday the resemblance between ||
the listeners to, music, and the infernal musician was very striking. {
Still the resemblance, “pained” the Record, and that is something.
Well, we have advanced somewhat in º toleration. The
Record is no more heeded than a dead blue-bottle on its back, dead as |
the last Record. Like the aforesaid dead, blue-bottle, the editor, has
buzzed his little nothing in his sackbut, and is despised. Still, we have
advanced somewhat, when a writer was fined, and condemned to two
years' imprisonment for calling GEORGE THE FOURTH “a fat Anoxis
of fifty,” and now a brimstone-faced Mawworm declares a resemblance
between VICTORIA and NERO, and is no more stopped in his way
meets with no more hindrance from his house to his office, than a dead
dog in its transit from Fleet ditch to the Thames. º

A STEAM BATTERY.
A CAPITAL joke appeared the other day in the Times. A correspondent
of that journal proposed to batter Sebastopol, by means of PERKINs's
steam-gun. This proposal has no doubt excited as much laughter as
the very best thing in JoE MILLER. Of course it is

What a laughable idea was that of steam-navigation when first
started ' When it became a fact, how ridiculous was the hope of its
That hope, however, having been justified, how
unreasonable it was to expect that a steam-vessel would ever cross the
Atlantic; and how utterly preposterous was the chimera of railroads!
Haw, haw, haw! chorussed the old gentlemen; and some of the young
ones, at each of these anticipated failures in, succession—hee-haw!
The impossibilities all came to pass, though.
Nevertheless, let us laugh at the suggestion of trying PERKINs's
steam-gum against Sebastopol. To be sure the son of MR. PERKINs
declares that he is “prepared to undertake to supply the Government
with a steam-gun capable of throwing a ball of a ton weight a distance
of five miles.” It is true that he adds the assurance that, with such a
gun, fixed in BRUNEL's º: ship of 10,000 tons, Sebastopol “might
be destroyed without [our]losing a man.” No doubt that to throw a
ball of a ton weight five miles by steam may be a less difficult thing
than to drag several tons, any number of miles, three or four times
faster than a stage-coach. But, then, fancy a gun loaded with steam
instead of powder!, What a * un!. And a bullet of a ton weight!

We can almost sympathise with the panic into which Ashted has
been plunged by this outrage upon her beadle, who we trust rejoices
in that thickness of skull which has protected so many of his fellow dig-
nitaries under similar difficulties. It is evident that a blow is aimed at
the head of a parochial state when it is aimed at the head of a Beadle,
and a stone thrown in that sacred direction, is in fact defiance hurled at
one of our most venerable institutions. In the Beadle may be said to
be united, the staff of authority, the gold lace of dignity, and the
cocked hat of power. It is due to his successors, that he should hand
down that staff unbroken; that gold lace untarnished; and that
cocked hat unstained by the mud of malice, or the stone of violence, to
an expectant posterity. We are glad to see that Ashted has spoken
out, and is ready to lay down its guinea, if not its life, in defence of its
Beadledom.

HOW THE HOLY MEN OF RUSSIA INSPIRE THEIR SOLDIERS.
THE MOTHERLESS CHILDREN OF FASHION.
We should be glad to know what has become of all the Mothers in
the Aristocratic circles, for if we are to judge by the paragraphs in the
fashionable papers, a Mother is a relationship that has become ex-
| tinct... The article now in fashionable use, as a substitute for the
once favourite character of a Mother, is described as a “maternal
arent,” with whom the young Wiscount So-AND-so is said to be
‘staying” when he happens to be at home with his Mamma. These
are really not the days for this kind of stupid affectation, and our dis;
gust at the absurdities of a highly artificial state of society is turned
into a somewhat stronger feeling, when we find the nearest of natural
ties deprived of its natural name in favour of a made-up title, more
adapted to the cold phraseology of fashionable life. If this, sort of
thing is to be carried further, it will be necessary to have a fashionable
dictionary, for the guidance of those who may wish, to render their
relationships into the terms current in “society.”—a phraseology which
may fairly . termed the slang of the salons. We give a specimen of
two or three words, which will be sufficient for the guidance of any one
who has the patience to pursue the disagreeable task:-
Mother.—A maternal parent.
Father.—An author of one's being on the paternal side.
Brother.—A male relative in a similar degree of affinity to the same |
parental stock.
Son: An individual of the masculine gender, deriving his being from the inflammation which terminated the patient's career.

Grandmother.—The maternal parent of a maternal or a paternal
parent.
Grandfather.—The paternal ditto of a ditto or ditto. .

he appearances observed were the
following:— -
The whole exterior exhibited a drab discolouration. -
The chest presented an almost total absence of heart; the pericardium
forming a kind of cyst, bag, or purse, resembling an old brown-paper
cap, and exhaling a strong odour of Russian leather, communicated to
it, by a quantity of rancid' oil, which constituted the liquor pericardii.
The heart, or what remained of it, afforded throughout a specimen of
fatty degeneration, and may be said to have consisted of tº. The
lungs were consolidated by a morbid deposit of a nature, apparently
bituminous, like pitch or tar, and the only air-tubes perceptible in them
had the appearance of straw.
In the stomach, the liver attracted attention by its remarkable
whiteness, which was owing to its structure having assumed a cottony
character. The convolutions of the viscera also bore a singular resem-
blance to cotton-twist.
The head contained an average proportion of brain, but it had been
all converted into lignine or woody fibre, disposed in bundles like deal
shavings, which smelt powerfully of turpentine.
All these appearances were considered quite sufficient to account for

been observed” to travel frequently during the last fortnight between
London and Manchester. We should have thought that in these days
of rapid locomotion a man might have made a few journeys to and fro
withºut subjecting himself to remark; but it appears that in Manchester
...different conjectures are made as to the cause of his eccentricity.”
These conjectures have, we find, terminated in the “general opinion
that he has suddenly become possessed of a large fortune, and his brain
has become affected.” As if there were no very satisfactory reason for |
thus summarily returning a verdict of insanity on a man who has fre-
quently travelled by rail, we are further informed, in confirmation
probably of the theory of “the lost senses,” that “he had three gold
chains to his watch.”
We should like to know in what way these gold chains are regarded
as supplying the links of evidence required to prove a case of insanity.
To us the circumstance of the three gold chains, coupled with the fact
of frequent |. by railway, would seem to afford proof of an
abundange of caution, and a sensible desire to prevent the loss of a
watch while travelling.
PAROCHIAL UNION IS STRENGTH.
A DeADLY, dispute has lately been going on between two parochial
paving boards, in a suburban neighbourhood. We are happy to an-
nounce that the feud has ceased, and that the Commissioners no longer
seek to use the public paving stones for the purpose of paving the way
to the gratification of their own ambition. 1. was a gratifying sight a
few days ago to see. the respective beadles presiding at a friendly
paving act of a once disputed footpath, and superintending the union
of “t º ” of the two lately hostile parties. We trust that the
gement used on the propitious occasion will be durable, and that the
kerbs, will operate on the passions as well as the pathways of the
neighbourhood.

be said of NICHOLAs and his savages?
OUR HOLY WAR.
His Holiness the Pope has convened a meeting of Prelates to tako
into consideration the propriety of g a new article to the Christian
Faith, in the view of thus appeasing the wrath of Heaven, and averting
the calamities which afflict the world. The Fisherman, whose successor
Pius esteems himself, PETER, and eleven others, are not supposed by
the Roman Pontiff to have settled the matter of belief above eighteen
hundred years ago. ſ
It is not for us to teach our Grandmother Rome, to suck eggs; yet
we would venture to suggest that the Pope might do something a little
more direct in relation to the present crisis than minting a new mystery.
Precedent for it would not be wanting. Did not sundry of his pre-
decessors of holy memory, promote and eneourage divers crusades,
inclusive of one against the Albigenses? Suppose, for the sake of
argument, that the Albigenses and the Saracens were miscreants, who
deserved to be exterminated with fire and sword. Can anything less
Are they not a set of mis-
believing cutthroats? That they are cutthroats we know, and of course
the Pope considers them misbelievers. They don’t believe in the whole
of the Nicene Creed, and what, perhaps, is almost as bad, they don't
believe in the Pore himself. They have persecuted the Pope's faithful
as well as MAHOMET's. They are now in arms, not, only against, us,
heretics, but against the soldiers of the Church, our Allies. Now, then,
is the time for his Holiness to come out in defence of his own. -
he not aid the French artillery by launching a fulmination against
Nicholas P. Our ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY does not do these
things. But they are competent to the Pope: and a }. anathema
hurled at the Tyrant’s head, would be worth some shells and rockets.
It is not, probable that the Papal benediction, or any other, of a
bullet would have the same effect as the fº of a rifle, or the oval
twist of a Lancaster gun. The ball would not be likely to go farther
or straighter for a Latin benison and a spargeſaction with holy water;
Bullets thus consecrated, however, would be aimed more steadily and
fired more sharply, by all who believed in them. The Czar stamps
his cannot shot with a cross." Small blame to him for that, if any, but
rather much the reverse, would be attributed by the Bishop of ROME
were it not that the cross is a Greek instead of a Latin one: . In place,
therefore, of holding an idle synod at Rome, the Pope should repair to
Paris, where he might crown the EMPEROR LOUIS NApoleoN, and
solemnly bless the French ammunition at the same time.
3. with this overt act, his Holi Ness might promulgate a Bull,
denouncing Nicholas as the Great Thief of the World, andſ raising the
hue and cry against him of all Christendom. The usual condition of
remission º penitence would of course be attached: but the offender
held up in the mean time as a Bear to be hunted down, or rather a
gigantic Rat to be baned.
. In his last pastoral the Pope abused some person or persons very
violently, but did not specify whom he meant. It is a pity that the
thunders of the Vatican should sound so vaguely. They seem to roar
at everybody in general, and nobody in particular: when there is some-
body who has so loudly called them down.
To place the Church of Rome in a great moral position; to show her
forth as the patroness of right and justice, and opponent of evil; to banish
the recollection of winking pictures and sham apparitions; why cannot
the Pope now make a demonstration against the CzARP Is it because
he wishes to convince Exeter Hall that he does not pretend to excom-
municate and depose Sovereigns? Wery likely.!

“CUCUMBERS AGREES witH Us!”
“PICKLED cucumbers agrees with us,” said MRs. GREEN, a jewess.
“Our peoples eats enormous quantities of pickles during the pass-
over.” This was given in solemn evidence by a mother in Israel
on Saturday last, struck forth by the truth-eliciting JAMEs in
presence of MR. BARQN MARTIN. “Pickles agrees with us!”
At first there seems little in this declaration of the Hebrew
mind as bearing on the Hebrew stomach; but a philosopher, like
Mr. Punch, sees in the words the whole wilderness before him, and
the wandering Israelites yearning for their cucurbitaceous provender.
“Cucumbers agrees with us,” says Mrs. GREEN, thousands of years
after the Wandering; attesting by that simple declaration at once the
antiquity and unchangeableness of Hebrew bowels. “We remember
the fish which we did eat freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, and the
abattachim,” lament the weary ones of the Desert. They longed for
the flesh-pots, the fish-pots, and the cucumbers. As it was in Egypt,
so is it now in the Minories |
... We believe that MR. DISRAELI attributes much of the success of
his eloquence to the fact that he is a great devourer of cucumbers.
His Caucasian stomach is true to its traditions. “Cucumbers agrees
with him!” Physiologists who delight to discover the source of out-
ward actions in the nutriment taken into the inward stomach would,
we doubt not, prove that Mr. DISRAELI when he spoke his boldest,
spoke biggest cucumbers. What, too, are those sharp and acid points?
Are they not words of exquisite keenness By no means: they are
no other than gherkins, pickled in the very finestvinegar. “Cucumbers
agrees with him l’”
With what a beautiful antiquity is the cucumber of Israel invested.
Thousands of years still lie upon it, freshly as morning bloom! Its
blossoms are yellow with immortal gold—the pure gold of Egypt. How
do the prophets delight to speak of it! “The daughter of Zion,”
says Isaiah, “is left, like a cottage in a vineyard, like a lodge in a
garden of cucumbers!” And again—“As a scarecrow in a garden of
cucumbers keepeth nothing, so are their gods of wood.” And even in
Qur time, does the gentile mind acknowledge and do compliment to the
Judaic love of cucumbers: hence, in the Gardener's Chronicle, a short
while since, we read the advertised virtues—virtues of great precocity
and great and enduring abundance—of “the Young Jewess,” a cu.
cumber of excelling price. Reader, when you behold—say a Jew
clothesman-munching a cucumber, do inward reverence to that cucur.
bitaceous Hebrew; for you behold in him a living antiquity; an unit
of the yºarning, multitudes who, Moses-led into the wilderness,
glamoured for the fish, they did freely eat in Egypt, together with
“ the cucumbers.” And tens and tens of centuries have passed, and
a mother in Israel solemnly attests in the Court of Exchequer that
during, the passºver ... our peoples eats enormous quantities of pickled
cucumbers.”. The PHARAohs are shadows; thinnest, and dimmest of
shades; but the Jew survives to cryold clothes, and still "cucumbers
agrees with him l’”
Tºo Qavious-Why is the next portion of MacAULAY's History of
Angland like the Premier?—Because everybody wishes it was out.
THE CANT OF CRITICISM.
THE Athenaeum has lately become affected with the “serious” cant of
the day, and the “good young man” who does the dramatic criticisms
takes the opportunity, while noticing a deservedly unsuccessful drama
at the Haymarket, to give a few dismal groans over the fact that the
comic muse has chosen a variety of subjects for ridicule. The
dramatic reporter in question sustains the “serious” character of
the present day by an exhibition of that customary mixture of melan-
choly and malice which so often renders the modern “saint” as great
a nuisance to himself as he would wish to be disagreeable to others.
If the Athenaeum really objects to a joke, or at all events to laughter,
it should avoid the solemn absurdities in which it is apt to indulge, for
if it really hates ridicule, it should abstain from making itself ridicu-
lous. In conclusion, we have only to say that though not affected by
the saturnine horror of the Athenaeum to everything in the shape of
gaiety, and though we think that even history may be fairly employed
as a means of satirising vice, folly, and crime, we do object to the
clumsy allusion to the possibility of our having “Comic Prayer Books,”
a contingency which the Athenæum profanely and stupidly alleges to be
the subject of “fair speculation.”

WINDowledge & Co., I shall be happy, also, to contribute to the

In addition to the above, which comprise, something like 1000 songs, I
also beg to offer 100 of the very best marbles that can be picked out of
the rich museum, I have established in my justly-celebrated “Marble

effect of making the hated Russian quickly knuckle down. -

“OUR EXISTING DRAMATISTS”
OUR emergetic contemporary, the Daily News, has made a most timely
discovery; he has found out a batch of English dramatists. Last week,
reviewing the Game of Speculation at the Lyceum, a Game in which
CHARLEs MATHEws is the finest of . cards; the quintessence of
assurance; extracting even an elixir from the base quality of impudence,
—the News says of the piece very profoundly, “it is a comedy in the
true sense of the word, and entitles its author, MR. LAWRENCE, to be
regarded as one of the ablest of our existing dramatists.” There is a
coldness, of impudence, quite Cossack in its temperature, with which
we rob the French of their goods, and then boast of them as of our own
manufacture. MR. LAWRENCE “nims” Mercadet, the original French
cambric, from the pocket of M. BALZAC, picks (out the owner's name,
and then, with j ink that ought to blush scarlet in the employ-
ment, writes his own peculating name in the corner—“SLINGSBY
LAw8ENCE ''” He becomes an “existing” dramatist | When IKEY
SoLoMons twitches the Freneh, watch from the foreigner's pocket,
straightway IKEY SoLoyſons is, by the act, “one of the ablest of our
existing watchmakers!” -
This crowing and clucking remind us of MRs. GRUNDy's fowls;
fowls that continually disturbed her neighbours with their notes of
self-exultation. “What wonderful layers are MRs. GRUNDY’s fowls!”
was the common cry. “By the noise they make, some of 'em must lay
twice or thrice a day. Most uncommon fowls!” Now, it happened
that they never laid a single egg. , Nevertheless, MRs. Gºunº took
an especial pride in the fowls; and smiled benignly when the neigh-
bours spoke of MRs. GRUNDY’s poultry as such wondrous layers!
MRs. GRUNDY was a great consumer of eggs. Eggs for breakfast;
eggs in custards, eggs in pancakes, in almost everything edible, eggs.
Well, every day—on some days twice or, thrice—Molly the maid
would be sent for eggs; as MPs. GRUNDY thought and paid for, fresh,
new-laid eggs. -
MoLLY returns from her errand. She lifts the yard-gate latch with
the key, and enters the premises, a basket on her arm, and in that
basket half-a-dozen eggs. Immediately, all MRs. GRUNDY's fowls begin

IT has long been agreed on all hands that nobody can understand a
Railway Time-Table. The Railway Companies, acting on this conclu-
sion, have apparently come to the sensible determination that inasmuch
as the pub
ic cannot obtain any information from a Time-Table, it
would be useless to give the public an opportunity of procuring one.
The Great Western seems to proceed on this principle; and accord-
ingly, though there are several branch offices of the Company in various

ere,” an inquiry for one is pretty sure to be answered by the excla-
mation “None Left. Sold.” The last word being intended perhaps

leisure for inspecting the extensive premises of the Company.

Operative. “WELL, why THE DEuce Don't you go THEN ?”
THE SPEECH FROM THE THRONE.
(As originally sketched by Lord AB-RD-N, but summarily and ignominiously
rejected by his Lordship's Colleagues.)
My LoRDs AND GENTLEMEN,
It had not been intended that Parliament should re-assemble
before Christmas, but the prescient sagacity and prompt energy of the
noble lord who is good enough to be the head of my Government, at
once foresaw a necessity, and provided a remedy. Resources are
wanting, and (as is sportively observed by the principal comedian in
* festive entertainments of the approaching holidays)-here we
all arc.
War with my ancient Christian ally, Russia, is still proceeding, and
it is to be regretted that the temper of the nation is such that though
the noble lord at the head of my Government is most desirous to make
peace at any price, the country will not listen to such counsel. Under
such circumstances there is no alternative but the reluctant prosecu-
tion of hostilities. -
You will have learned by the papers and (at very considerably later
periods) by the Government despatches, that sincenyour dissolution in
August, three victories, those of Alma, of Balaklava, and of Inkermann,
have shed a baleful lustre upon British arms. The noble lord at the
head of my Government will, in his º: here, explain to youthat these
victories are entire mistakes, and that had a policy, martial enough to
save º but devoid of aggravation to the EMPERoR of Russia,
been adopted by the leaders of the allies, peace, which is the object of
war, would have been more facile of attainment. But at the same time
as the victories have been won, they must be accepted and registered
as brilliant errors.
The conduct of the EMPERoR of Austria and of the KING of
PRussia is, in the opinion of the noble lord at the head of my Govern-
ment, most admirable. It is matter of congratulation that I have been
enabled to enter into an alliance with the former power, by which
Austria is, in the most solemn and categoric manner, bound to act with
the strictest regard to contingencies, modified by circumstances, de-
pendent upon probabilities, and interpreted by eventualities. Thus
assured of the hearty co-operation of Austria, we regard with equal
respect and pleasure the impartial attitude assumed by Prussia, who
negatives allincentives to demonstration until the ultimate fortune of
the complicated struggle shall be evident to the weakest intellect—I
allude, of course, to that of the Sovereign of Prussia.
... should expedite antiquated imbecility.”
I receive the most flattering assurances from the PREsin ENT of THE
UNITED STATEs that he hopes ere ºf to be able to relieve me of any
trouble with reference to Cuba, and later he trusts to be enabled to
make a similar communication in regard to Canada. The noble lord at
the head of my Government hopes that no jealous or hostile feeling
will be permitted to mar either pacific º:
From my ally the EMPERoR of THE FRENch it is impossible to deny
that England is º the most cordial co-operation in carrying on
the war, and the noble lord at the head of my Government, who has
never ceased to entertain unfriendly feelings towards his Imperial
Majesty, can only see in this proof of his readiness to join in an unjust
quarrel an evidence of the noble lord's original wisdom in impeding,
as far as possible, the alliance of the nations.
GENTLEMEN of THE House of CoMMons,
It is not the fault of the noble lord at the head of my Govern-
ment that we are º in this most expensive and objectionable
contest, but as such is the case, the nation must pay for it. A great
deal of money is wanting, and the noble lord suggests to you that by
-
|imposing the most disagreeable taxation you do your best to disgust
the nation with the war.
My LoRDs AND GENTLEMEN,
You will not have to discuss a single measure of importance,
and the noble lord at the head of my Government wishes to impress
upon you that another of the evils of this war is that the whole time of
the Ministers is taken up in reading the newspapers, and therefore that
no attention can be given to the preparation of bills.
As soon as the measures regarding the militia, for the passing of
which you have been specially summoned, shall be enacted, which the
noble lord at the head of my Government thinks had better be done
without discussion, you can all return to your country residences,
where it is to be wished that you may enjoy a merry Christmas, ren-
dered still more joyous by the assurance, which the noble lord at the
head of my Government requests me to give you, namely, that he has
not the most distant idea of resigning office, “unless pedal propulsion
been surreptitiously appended by Wiscount P−n.]
WANTED A PRISONER."
We wish people would say distinctly what they want when they
advertise in the newspapers. We often see an intimation that some-
body wants a clerk, when he is apparently looking out for a thief, for
as we have already pointed out, honesty and starvation are not always
compatible. In the following instance we think the advertiser must
be on the look-out for a prisoner. The extract is from the Ereter
Flying Post of a recent date—
CLErk WANTED.
WANTER in an Office in the Country, a respectable Young Man as
clerk. He must be a good Accountant, and one who can bear much confinement.

Ab
The young man who is to “bear much confinement” on £15 a year
had better enlist in the Russian service, get taken by the English, an
he would be considerably better off as a Russian prisoner, than as a
captive clerk in an English office. Instead of Fº up subscriptions
to add to the comforts of the subjects of the Czar who have fallen into
our hands in the course of the war, it would be far more worthy of
British benevolence to get up a subscription for the poor ill-paid clerks
who are bearing “much confinement” on very little salaries.
A Saint Militant.
BEFoRE every sortie of the Russians the . of St. Nicholas
is carried round the batteries. As there is some doubt of the validity
of Russian orders of Saintship, it is probable that this act is intended
to put the “Canonization” of the CZAR's sainted namesake beyond all
question.
It is proposed that henceforth pilgrims to the saint's shrine, shall
carry on theirºshoulders, bomb-shells, instead of scallop-ditto, and in
their hands, instead of the usual pilgrim's staff, a gun-rammer.

THE PARVENU AND THE BOTTLE-HOLDER.
“The greatest interest is excited,” says a Paris Correspondent, “about a conversa-
tion which has taken place at St.-Cloud, between the EMPEaoh and Lord PALMERston.”
On reading this, Mr. Punch immediately wrote to both, for their notes of the conversa-
tion in question, and as he thinks that its publication may be serviceable, he prints
it without the slightest hesitation, or the formality of asking leave of either of his
above-mentioned friends.

Apropos of nothing, CLARENDON
what shall we say of a certain Ministry?
Bottle-holder (demurely). Whatever your Majesty may please to say
of that Ministry it will be for me to listen to with resignation. I would
add that your Majesty is skilful in the use [of language, but I must
doubt whether it will occur to . to speak more severely, as regards
that estimable body, than people speak in England.
Parrem. Åhº fetus omit censure." How much more pleasant to
speak in eulogy of the chivalry of an able and popular statesman, who
consents to share the obloquy cast upon, his colleagues, and who
descends to an inferior station that he may the more effectually serve
them at need.
Bottle-holder. I have reason to believe, your Majesty, that my
motives are even more emphatically recognised by my colleagues than
are my services. [They earchange glances.
Parvenu. That is well, for then, no matter what may occur, there
can be no charge of treachery or insincerity. This is a malicious world,
and cruelly apt to place, wrong constructions upon actions., Let us
project our minds into, the future, and suppose that something has
occurred upon which (but for the understanding you describe) our
friend ABERDEEN might look unfavourably.
Bottle-holder. Does your Majesty mean a glorious triumph of the
Allied Arms ?

many such triumphs. -

yery early life you recollect that it was feared that characteristic might

adhering to you. Possibly, if I mentioned you as PREMIER, you might
almost get up a blush.
Bottle-holder. We have arranged with ABERDEEN, your Majesty,
who has a great deal of blushing for himself to do, that he shall under-
take that duty for us all. I venture to think that I can bear the
dazzling vision your Majesty has been pleased to raise.
Partenu. “A Scotch mist clears away, and discovers an English
Minister at the head of English affairs.” After that stage direction,
my Lord, what follows?.
Bottle-holder (with animation). Not England—she has followed long
enough. It is time she began to lead.
Parvenu (imperturbably). Never excite yourself. What do you
mean by lead? Do you take the word from the card-table? Because,
if so, you must know that no one can lead out of his turn.
Bottle-holder. I admit it, your Majesty, but when we are sick of irre-
solute play, of being deceived, of having (indignantly) our best hearts
forced, until they are covered by the adversary's spades—
Parvenu (... Enough—enough—France, too, has her account
to settle with that accursed Crimea.
Bottle-holder (recovering himself). Then, your Majesty, it is possible
to demand a change of partners. In other words—will your Majesty
pardon my being for a moment in earnest—if England finds that out of
all Europe, France alone is her friend, rely upon it that England does
not play again the old foolish wretched game which recognised neutrality
where it could not obtain friendship. In presence of Russia, the great
powers shall be my—shall be England's friends, or her enemies. .
Parvenu. You cannot make them the first. Despotic Austria, for
instance, can never really be the friend of democratic England.
Bottle-holder. No, your Majesty, but thank Heaven, I can–I could,
I should say (under the circumstances you were pleased to suppose)
make Austria our bitter and avowed enemy.
Parrenu. Why, while her ruler is FRANCIs Joseph-
Bottle-holder. May I–with apologies for the interruption-suppose
the name to be Joseph, without the FRANCIS. The two syllables could
be got rid of at slight expense and by simple process, which would have
the additional advantage (slowly) of involving the fall of the House of
HAPsburg, the regeneration of Hungary, and of Italy, the triumph of
one Giuseppe, surnamed MAzzINI, and the establishment of a perma-
nent barrier against Cossack aggression—all trifles, but fortunately, to
be obtained at trifling cost, if one happened to want them. -
Parvenu. Continentals certainly give England credit for lifking to
such results without a shudder. Possibly, the nerves of France may
be less firm. -
Bottle-holder. What if she should invigorate them by a plunge into the
Lower Rhine. We promise not to steal her clothes while she is
bathing, as a particular friend of your Majesty's and mine observed.
Parvenu. With that understanding, I could afford to let the people
of France see the people of Austria allowed to imitate my subjects
(gravely) and choose their own ruler.
Bottleholder (gravely). Without venturing to pronounce an opinion
upon your Majesty's economy or means, I can assure you that the next
Ministry of which I may have the honour of forming part, will have no
sentimental traditions in reference to Germany.

generally preach in a similar spirit about matrimony. He has quite a
right to puff his own business. Let nobody envy his Reverence his
harmless gains. Connaught contains some wild lads whom his sermons
will have rendered steady. Those discourses will probably not be
found to prevent the Connaught Militia from obtaining its complement
of recruits: although they may thin the ranks of a certain brigade of

doubtless fight for their wives and children, and so (in Connaught
certainly) will all the bachelors.

THE FIRST RAILWAY
IN AUSTRALIA.
N Australian paper
gives an account
of the start-and
rather a “rum
start" it was—of |
the first Railº
in Australia., The
line is called the
Hobson’s Bay
Line; and from the
account of the
proceedings we
should say, that in
the case of Hob-
son’s Bay Hobson’s
choice has been
realised. The
Colony must be
satisfied with the
best it can get,
though the Rail-
way Line seems to
- - be something quite
out of the line of the Australians, if we may judge by the description
contained in the following paragraph, extracted from the Sydney
Empire, of the 18th of September:—
“SIR CHARLEs and Lady HotHAM and a considerable number of the distinguished
officials having taken their places in the train, which only consisted of four carriages,
the signal was given to proceed. The steam was turned on, but the iron horse would
not budge an inch. Great was the dismay depicted on the face of the engineer and
engine-driver. The valve was opened to its widest extent, and the pantings of the
over-laden steam horse were quite alarming. The band of the 40th struck up a merry
tune to hide the confusion, but still the train would not move. Accordingly a whole
host of railway porters and policemen set to work and pushed it along the line by main |
force for a hundred yards, when it again came to a dead stop. More police then came
on, and a stout gentleman in a dress coat, ready for the banquet, came behind and
applied his shoulder vigorously to the buffer of the last carriage, and at last, by slow
degrees, the train moved, amid shouts of laughter from the assembled thousands in
Flinders Street.” -
This is not exactly the way to 'go ahead in an infant Colony, and
though the police, may be considered to . the great principle
implied in the words, “moye on 1’’ we do not think, “the force should
be used in applying that principle to an obstinate railway train. Even the
police, however, could not make the Hobson's Bay locomotive “move
on 1" and it was only when “astout gentleman in a dress coat” applied
his shoulder to the “buffer”—and it became a question of “buffer
against buffer,” that the train moved in earnest, and the old buffer
triumphed over the new one. As it is probable that the stout party in
the dress coat will not be always at hand to put his shoulder to the
wheel of a refractory railway carriage, it is to be hoped that the Aus-
tralians will get up their steam a little better than they did on the
inauguration of their first Railway. Later advices are, however, not
very encouraging, for a more recent extract informs us that:-
“As the six o'clock train was leaving Sandridge a slight derangement occurred which
prevented its progress, so that the passengers had to alight and walk up to town. The
stoppage was understood to arise from some of the fire bars having fallen out, so that
the fire could not be sustaimed.”
... What with an engine that won't strike out, and a fire that won't keep
in, we fear that the railway system must be considered in a state of
infancy, or even babyhood in Australia.

THE POISONERS OF THE PRESENT CENTURY.
THE Morning Post reports an assemblage of medical and scientific
gentlemen, which took place last week at Birmingham, to discuss a
question of much importance to the interior. The stomach is supposed
to be principally a receptacle for two classes of substances; ; and
physic. Together with these, however, in point of fact, it admits a
considerable quantity of rubbish jºi with them by certain
rascals. The consideration of what measures the Legislature should
adopt to put, an end to this villany constituted the business of the
meeting, in the course of which a gentleman named PostGATE made
some statements which are calculated to make us open our eyes and
shut our mouths.
We turn up our noses at the poor creatures who subsist upon
potatoes: we had better turn them down again. We flatter our-
selves that we eat bread; but bread, according to MR. PostGATE, in
many cases, consists of the despised root in the ratio of a quartern to
a peck of meal. To a proportionate extent the stomach and system of
the consumer are cheated out of nitrogen, which potato-flour does not
contain. But whilst the bread is mimus nitrogen, it is plus alum
together with a quantity of water amounting to 50 per cent. To cali
such a mixture the staff of life is ridiculous. For staff, read stuff, and
omit life—or substitute the reverse. The stuff cannot be capable of
supporting life; and thus, as a jocular chemist may have remarked,
though deficient in nitrogen it abounds in azote. It may be necessary
to explain to children in arms that azote means that which does not
support life, and that it is an alias of the substance now called nitrogen,
º was applied thereto when chemistry was, like themselves, in its
Inlancy.
By the same authority we are given to understand that we are apt
to be much mistaken when we think we are helping ourselves to
cream; anatto and turmeric communicate the appearance by which we
delude ourselves: we add little to our tea or coffee but colouring
matter, which may be defined as azure or sky-blue disguised with drab.
It further appears that grains of Paradise, if they are not to be taken
cum grano salis, are usually not to be bought without a great many
grains of linseed. This fact concerns all who delight in beer, and do
not brew their own. Grains of Paradise are brewers’ grains—albeit,
unfit for pigs. The brewer who cheats his customers therewith has
himself been cheated by his druggist; and those who place their
Fº in beer, and drink his, get but a very slight taste of their fool's
paradise.
Honey, generally supposed to be derived from the bloom of plants,
is stated to be made in great part out of bakers' flour, to which are
added raw sugar and pipeclay by the dishonest imitators of the
industrious bee.
jº lozenges, instead of having sugar for their base, have a
much baser substance, namely, plaster of Paris, so that when swallowed
they become changed from confections into concretions. The plaster
of Paris is qualified with a little 'starch—but that, at any rate, would
not prevent its stiffening. MR. PostGATE also says that the acid of
acidulated drops is the sulphuric : whilst tartaric acid is, in the pro-
portion of 30 per cent, no acid at all, but merely an astringent, viz.,
alum: a sort of tartaric acid that must have been invented in Tartarus.
It does not appear that the meeting succeeded in devising any
adequate punishment for the adulteration of diet and medicine. The
best would be to make an offender subsist on adulterated diet till he
was ill, and then to physic him with adulterated medicine.
The Russian Bear and his Cubs.
It is understood that the EMPEROR of Russia has bestowed the
order of something or other upon his two sons for “the bravery they
displayed both before and after the battle of Inkermann.” We cannot
compliment the “licked cubs” of the CzAR on a display of courage at
once premature and tardy, for the valour that intrudes itself before a
battle begins must be as much out of place as the heroism that is
exhibited after a battle is over. We suspect that there is a good deal
of Russian bravery of the same inopportune kind, and we confess we
have greater admiration for the courage of the allies, which makes itself
manifest at the exact time when it is wanted.

A CERTAIN LORD, lately commanding a
Cavalry regiment, has resigned his Command
and retired from the service at the most
critical period of the Campaign. The act has
excited much remark among the Army, not
flattering (we are bound to add) to the officer
setting such an example at such a time.
The officer has returned to England. How
has he been received in that quarter in which,
for the soldier, stands the fountain of honour?

with that chill and cutting civility, which is
bitterer than reproof?
That officer has more than once had the
honour of being the guest of the QUEEN.
Heaven forbid that at this moment MR.

aught but the language of affectionate loyalty.
But the next time he dines at Windsor, he

THE WAR AND THE BUMBLES.
HE parochial pa-
triots are comin
out again in f
force, or rather
in full feebleness.
The vestry of St.
Pancras echoes
once more with
the declamations
of dissentients
and the Boar
Room of Maryle-
bone vibrates with
the eloquence of
the parochial mal-
contents. When-
ever there is a
“crisis” the Me-
tropolitan vestries
begin to indulge
in those irrele-
vancies which lead
them to neglect
their own proper
business, and set them off on a Quixotic inquiry into the merits of
Ministers, instead of adhering to their proper province of controlling
parish expenditure. The parochial patriot gets so inflated with the
idea of his own importance that he feels himself a statesman instead
of a vestryman, and he asks indi tly what is going on “out of
doors,” a pompous question we should like to answer literally, §
saying, that." #. are just going round with the afternoon’s milk, an
crying ‘muffins.” |g
The War is, of course, a fine field for the senators of the Westry
Room, and poor LoRD ABERDEEN is being spattered with the patriotic
mud of parochial invective, at least once a week in at least two of the
London parishes. We are continually nauseated by reports of speeches
in which we are told of the “attitude Marylebone must assume,” and
“the position St. Pancras must take up,” in “the present state ofthings
in the Crimea.” We recommend the yestrymen, most of whom are
respectable tradesmen, to be satisfied with assuming a graceful “atti-
i. ” while waiting on their customers, and taking up a becoming
“ position” behind their respective counters. -
t is very kind of the parochial patriots to think of “serving their
country;” but if they will, for the present, content themselves, with
serving those who favour them with orders, their country will be
equally obliged to them. We are sometimes afraid from their language
which is full of allusions to “honourable members” and “this side of
the house” that the Westrymen have all gone mad, and imagine them-
selves the House of Commons, nor should we be surprised at their
treating one of their own resolutions as an Act of Parliament, and
speaking of it, as chapter so-and-so, of the 4 and 5 of Nicolay, or
the 6 and 7 of D'IFPANGER. If these sort of fooleries continue, we
shall really feel disposed to get somebody to act the part of a parochial
CRoxwell, and dissolve the parochial parliament at one fell swoop,
by ordering the Beadle, who we believe is always in attendance, with
his cocked-hat and brass-headed staff, to “take away that bauble.”
A BACK-HANDER."
In this country there is a strong tendency in things to start up the
more you try to put them down, and in fact if a thing is really good
there is no quizzing it out of its vitality. We have occasionally
jº in a good humoured joke at the expense of our rusty fusty
friend Bagh, the great composer of innumerable Ops, and whose
sundry Schezzi in A, B, or C, are anything but A B C work to those
who conscientiously try to “render them.” Such however is, the
tenacity with which the virtuosi keep in what may be called the BAcm
ground of the musical world, that a “Bach Society” has sprung, or
rather toddled, into existence. This society we believe invites an
audience, and has such a thorough-going way of BACH-ing its friends,
that there is nothing to be heard but Bach during the º: evening.
We shall expect to find the BACH enthusiasm ultimately reaching such
a height that the BACHITEs will be satisfied with nothing less than a
BACH attic in which to hold their meetings.

CICERo says that nobody dances, sober. From this rule, of course,
are to be excepted individuals of the feminine gender. Ladies have a
sufficient motive for dancing. It is the only exercise, worthy of the
name, that they ever take.". In dancing, moreover, they carry out the
principal end of their education, which is to present the most attractive
ºutward appearance possible. A dancing-girl is a display of a pretty
figure in, elegant attire, and graceful attitudes. A dancing-man is a
comical object. He would, indeed, bean exhibition entirely pitiable, but

Any doubt that may exist about the nature of the influence under

THE WAR EXHIBITIONS.
SINCE ASTLEy's gallantly led the way with the Battle ºf the Alma,
and gained the heights of popularity, as well as the heights before
Sebastopol, the example has been followed by numerous caterers for
the entertainment of the public; and there seems to be no investment
so profitable as the investment of Sebastopol. The war is not confined
to the Crimea, but it has been carried into the very heart of England,
and has even found its way to Clifton, whose walls bear the marks of
some tremendous broadsides, which have been poured into the place,
with the hope of taking it by storm, and laying siege to the pockets of
the inhabitants. The war now being waged in the West is a sort of
counterfeit of the war in the East; and while, at the Crimea, we have
England's war with the Czar, we find at Clifton “Gompºrtz's war
with Russia.”. It appears from GompenTz's printed declaration of
war, that he has for twenty years been engaged in hostilities—on
canvas-with the enemies of this country; for, “stimulated by the
general appreciation of his war with China, and, on a prior occasion,
that of the Cabul passes,” he has, it seems, gone to war with Russia
on a scale of magnitude and an extent of canvas far exceeding his
former achievements.
We wish that, England were as triumphant with her stores and
ammunition as GoſpeFTzis with his paint pot and his Few “brushes.”

the Crimea “elicits,” as we are informed by himself, “the most
enthusiastic and simultaneous expressions of º. and we can
well understand how the enthusiasm reaches its height when Gompertz
º his war with Russia to a conclusion by the “ultimate triumph
of the allied armies.” With such a result before us, we wonder there
is not a cry of “GoMPERTZ for Premier,” in place of ABERDEEN, and
indeed of the two men, the views of the former will the better bear
canvassing. -
In the explanatory bill that forms as it were the programme of the
war, our friend GolfpenTZ gives a succinct account of the policy of the
CzAR, which we are informed was of such a nature as to render hos-
tilities—and of course GoMPERTz's panorama—utterly inevitable.
Nicholas is therefore denounced as being responsible for the frightful
shedding of blood-and consumption of paint—which has come to pass;
so that on his head will fall the whole of the consequences, including
bombs, ten-pounders, paint-pots and paintbrushes, which England's:
and Gompeitz's—war with Russia have called into powerful activity.”

If “LeoNors” is a ward

that “Leopold * should

we are not sure that our

is not guilty of a contempt
of court in aiding the pro-
cess of unauthorised love-

pledge their faith and per-
form other similarly absurd freaks through the medium of an
advertisement. We perceive that the CHANGELLOR refused to let a
young man out of durance the other day until he had placed all letters
he had received from the object of his adoration in the hands of his
lordship. Possibly the communications might have been partly con;
tained in a file of the Times, where, if couched in cyphers, they would
have afforded his lordship a series of “nuts to crack,” with his port
during the approaching Christmas. If LoRD CRAN worth should fin
any difficulty, we flatter ourselves we are rather clever at getting at a
kernel through the hardest shell, and we shall be happy to place at the
disposal of the Court of Chancery, our own intellectual nut-crackers.
As a specimen of our abilities we beg to call the attention of the
CHANCELIok to the following from the Times of November 30, which
is probably intended for the eye of some ward of the court whom we
are perhaps saving from the grasp of some needy, greedy, and seedy
adventurer by the course we are now taking—

translation of the above rather transparent piece of protestation-

A QUERY FOR THE WAR OFFICE.
ONCE upon a time, it is said, there was a Brigadier-General in India.
GENERAL NoTT was his commander-in-chief. General, Nott sent to
the Brigadier an order to advance with the troops under his command.
The Brigadier sent answer that it was impossible—no doubt for some
exeellent military reason. GENERAL NoTT sent back to the Brigadier
a repetition of his order. With it was a letter informing the Brigadier
that a duplicate of the order had been sent to his second in command,
with directions, if the Brigadier, still declined to advance, to advance
the Brigade and bring the Brigadier along with it under fixed bayonets.
So runs the story, Mr. Punch would respectfully ask the DUKE 9F
NewcasTLE if he has ever heard it. And if he have, does he know the
name of the Brigadier? And if he know, would he oblige Mr. Punch
| deprive that, army of the services of LoRD
by informing him whether that Brigadier now commands a division of
the army of the Crimea, and, further, whether, if anything happen to
RAGLAN, the routine of
service, which would entitle this Brigadier to the command in place
of LoRD RAGLAN, would be followed?
Justice to the Enemy.
Russian exaggeration of the numbers of the Allies who beat them at
Alma and Inkermann, may not be entirely wilful falsehood. After the

LAW v. PHILOSOPHY.
A MAN, it is said, is either a fool or a physician, at forty, and it
appears by a recent decision of LoRD CAMPBELL, that a man is either
a fool or a philosopher when the tax-gatherer calls. “Given t, a, r, to
find a philosopher” is a problem which has been recently solved by that
learned judge, in re the Cambridge Philosophical Society. We should
be sorry, however, to come to the conclusion pointed at by the decision
mentioned, as we do not wish to be classed with the conscience-stricken
maniacs who are continually sending voluntary contributions to the
CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchequER. But whichever view is taken of
the matter, it is pleasing to know that the payment of a few shillings
by the philosophers of Cambridge (long life to them) will not be a very
- eat discouragement to
the cause of Science. MR. Apaxis, who is doubtless on the eve of
discovery of a new planet, will discover it notwithstanding, and he will,
we know, be among the first to rejoice if the contributions from his
Alma Mater hasten in any degree #. subjection of the Great Bear.
MR. JUSTICE WIGHTMAN asks, “what are the º objects, of a
Society which spends more money in newspapers than in philosophical
publications.” Without stopping to enquire how far that will, depend
on the relative price and numbers .. of each class (if there are
two classes) let us ask a question or two. What is News? Do only
fools read newspapers? The philosopher who was “caught” eating
the “delicacies of the season” replied in answer to the sneer of an
acquaintance, “Do you suppose that all the good things were meant for
the fools,” and Punch begs to ask, Do you suppose that º
were meant only for fools? Do newspapers never philosophise? Does
Punch never philosophise? And, besides, do not the so-called
hilosophical journals contain news? The announcement. in the
#...] Transactions" of the next discovery by MR. HIND of a
new star (; Hippopotami he may call it) will be as much “news” as is
the announcement in the newspapers that any one is, giving Vulgar
Burlesque, or “starring” it in the east. Or suppose the following to
appear in the Chemical Gazette:—
“NEw Method of PREPARING MoxoDITETRETHYLoMETHYLophopyLAMYLAMONIUM.
—The proper materials are placed in a suitable apparatus, raised to the required
temperature, and the heat continned as long as necessary; when the ºject is attained,

bath,' and, if the operation is not successful, piched to the deuce."

Would not this be news? . it may be objected that, the
stuff with the long name is a non-isolated radicle; but surely if there
is any wisdom in the wigs of the Bench, it will be admitted that the
mere title of the recipe makes every atom of it equivalent to news. In
conclusion, it may be well to observe, that while we object to the
inference that no philosophers read newspapers, though such inference
be made by all the judges, even the holder of the Great Seal—we would

And the brave men who fight under them to put a Tyrant down.
No end of glory to them all; of honour and renown
To those who live : to them that fall an everlasting crown.
As loud a cheer give, England, to the Navvies' gallant band
Who have gone to lend our warriors a stalwart helping hand.
These to their work with shovel and crow-bar as true will stand,
As those to theirs with bayonet, with rifle, or with brand.

And they’ll dig at the foundations of the Tyrant with their spade.

Has he for subjects working men who hold their country dear?
In Russia are there any on his side to volunteer?
How many Navvies have they there to match our fellows here?

Her sons go forth to fight for her when they are free to stay:
And many more will follow where the Navvies led the way,

does not prevent the softer parts of their old worn-out frames from
commingling in the form of those gases which they are resolved into

“The Duke of Newcastle
presents his compliments to

lace at his disposal, the
ollowing despatch from
F.M. LoRD RAGLAN, which
by an accident, over which
the Duke had no control,

Head Quarters, Camp before
Sebastopol, Dec. 1, 1854.
My Lord DUKE,
MY'previous despatches
(Nos. 60 to 69) having been
written immediately after
the actions to which they
respectively refer, were
necessarily imperfect in de-
tails. elieve, however
that they will be found
wanting in none of the
particulars, on which infor-
mation is demanded by the
- - forms of the Service.
In compliance with the rule usually followed in such communications,
able notice of your Grace, for the well-merited recognition of the
Country, the admirable conduct of every member of my personal staff
on all occasions, the indefatigable exertions of all the Generals com-
manding Divisions and Brigades, and the manner in which these
exertions have been seconded by all the members of all the personal
staffs of all these Generals, without a single exception. cannot
charge my memory, with any omission in this respect, though for my
fulfilment of this pleasing duty, I take no credit to myself.
Intimate as I am with the Officers serving on my own staff (most of
connections), sharing with them not only the labours and dangers of
the field, but the few hours of enjoyment and repose which the hard:
ships of the campaign leave at our disposal, it is but natural I should
bear ample and cheerful testimony to the accuracy and speed with
which these Officers have carried my orders, their admirable horseman-
ship, their agreeable social qualities, the readiness with which they have
borne unwonted privations, and their coolness under the hottest fire.
Under these circumstances, it would have been unpardonable in me
not to have assigned to these Officers the first place in all my official
communications. The General Officers serving under my command,
have, no doubt, been actuated by similar feelings (prompted by motives
as creditable to all parties, and by services as conspicuous), in bringing
so prominently forward for favourable consideration the names of the
officers ...i their respective staffs.
No General and no Staff Officer having been left unnoticed, it may
have been thought that my duty, as the medium for directing attention
to eminent services, had been fulfilled.
thas, however, been º. to me from quarters entitled to
respect, that some notice of Officers in lower grades of the army would
be neither injurious to the Service, unacceptable to your Grace, nor
displeasing to the country. -
he names of even some Non-commissioned Qfficers and Privates have
reached me, as having done their duty under difficult circumstances, in
a manner to merit particular mention.
I am aware that, in venturing to bring under your Grace's favourable
consideration the names of merely Regimental Officers, possessing no
claim ºf hereditary rank or social distinction, and still more in
i.; to the ranks for conspicuous examples of heroism and self
devotion, I am departing from precedent in a way many may think
inexpedient and even hazardous. But I humbly venture to suggest
that the conduct of the British i.". throughout this campaign, has
been such as to justify me in a wide deviation from rule, and I do not
apprehend that any danger is to be feared from the course I am
about to take.
The conduct of the Artillery, both in the batteries and the field has,
throughout the campaign, been beyond praise, and I subjoin a list of
Officers who have especially distinguished themselves.”
I have already repaired the oversight by which I had omitted, till
my last despatch, all mention of CAPTAIN MAUDE, of the Horse
Artillery, whose severe wound in the action of the 25th, has, for a time,
deprived the army of one of its ablest and most emergetic officers in this
arm. The Officers of the same arm, whose names are appended, have,
on every occasion, shown themselves worthy of the utmost confidence,
and I beg to recommend these Officers to your Grace's most favourable
consideration. - - -
It is difficult for me to describe my obligations to LIEUTENANT-
CoLoREL Dixon, to whose resistless energy in bringing up his two
eighteen pounder guns in the Battle of Inkermann (in connexion with
the timely charge of the division of GENERAL 5.º. I attribute
the decision of that well-fought day in our favour. Nothing could
exceed the stubborn courage of the whole British Army in that
unparallelled encounter, with , overwhelming numbers. ... It was an
action, the glorious result of which can be but little attributed to my
own dispositions as Commander-in-Chief, or to the unwearied services
of my personal staff, any more than to those of the Generals of Division
or Brigade, or their several staffs, all of whom I have already recom-
mended to your Grace's most favourable consideration for their conduct
on that occasion. It was essentially a struggle of regiments, not a com:
|bination of masses, and was decided, not by strategy, but by the personal
prowess of regimental officers (both Commissioned and Non-commis-
sioned), and the unparalleled steadiness of the British private soldier.
In the case of the Guards' Division, this characterstic, was particu-
larly conspicuous. Owing to the wound which, early in the action, dis-
abled GENERAL BENTINck, and the employment of his Roy ALHIGHNEss
THE DUKE of CAMBRIDGE in other parts of the field, these splendid
troops were for some hours left, virtually without a General Officer in
command, but I am bound to say that, thanks to Colonel UPTON, the
want did not seem to be felt. The noble young men, to whom were
entrusted the colours of the different regiments, and their coverin
Serjeants, supplied a rallying point to the shattered battalions, an
every Öfficer engaged covered himself with honour.
I have not hitherto had an opportunity of visiting the camp of this
Division, but the moment I can find leisure to do so, I propose (if your
Grace do not consider the proceeding injudicious) to take an oppor-
tunity of º; them for their heroic defence of the redoubt, which
formed the key of our position on the right,
I hope (subject to your Grace's approval) to be able to offer the same
i. of the merits of every regiment engaged.
besides the Officers whose names are annexed, I would earnestly recom-
mend to notice the services of CAPTAIN ELLISON of the Fusiliers, who,
Meanwhile,
with admirable presence of mind, suggested to his men the use of
stones, when their ammunition was exhausted; and those of a Serjeant
of the Coldstreams, who, single-handed, captured sixteen Russian
soldiers, but whose name I omitted to enquire, when I encountered
him conducting his prisoners to the rear, with the unpretending air of
a man who had performed a simple act of duty. Your Grace will pardon
me for adding, that a Commission could not be better bestowed than
on this Serjeant, should I eventually succeed in discovering him.
The limits of a dispatch will not allow me to particularise examples,
when not to be a hero was to be conspicuous, and it is extremel
difficult to arrive at names, with which I have no familiar or habitua
connection. But I beg to add as many of these names as have reached
me.” I cannot refrain from recommending to such consideration as can
be bestowed on a Private, Joseph Coulter (whose regiment you may
ascertain by reference to his letter published in the Times), who (as
find from the public prints) after receiving two serious wounds, main-
tained his place in the ranks, and finally carried out of the field, in
** parts of his person, four Russian bullets and the fragment of a
Snell.
SULLIvan of the 30th regiment, specially brought under my notice for
The mention of this man's name recalls to me that of SERJEANT
his conduct in the action of the 26th, by GENERAL SIR DE LACY EVANs,
but omitted from my despatch forwarding the report of that distin-
guished officer. I have reason to believe that the rank of the Service
to which SERGEANT SULLIVAN belongs would appreciate any favour
which can, consistently with propriety, be shown to that person, and
that it might even prove of value in stimulating the private soldiers, -
who are by no means so insensible to the motives of hope and pride as
y my previous experience, I had been led to anticipate. I believe
that the recognition of the services of this rank of the Service might
be carried further without disadvantage. If a certain number of com-
missions were placcd at my disposal to be given to highly distinguished
non-commissioned officers, 1 venture to suggest that young men of a
superior class, both in social standing and intelligence, might be
attracted to the Service.
The conduct of PRIVATE WHEATLEy, in throwing an unexploded shell
over the parapet of the battery in which he was stationed, has already
received its reward—a gratuity of £5. But it has been suggested to
me that there are some, even in the ranks, who are more sensible to
honour, than to money. And if some reward of merit could be dis-
covered (akin to the French cross of the Legion of Honour) accessible
to Privates as well as Officers, there are not wanting *. who main-
tain that the distinction would be eagerly sought and highly prized by
the common soldier, and that even Officers would not, shrink from
accepting it. I only submit this, however, with great deference, for
your Grace's consideration.

To the Qificers of the Medical Service, the army and the country owe
a deep debt of gratitude, which some day, I hope, will be paid, and
which is the heavier, as the convenience of these Officers, both
ersonal, and professional, cannot always be consulted. Meanwhile,
I would ſº recall to your grace the act of self-devotion to which
Assist ANT-SurgeoN THOMPson of the 44th regiment fell a sacrifice
after the action of the Alma.
That Officer (as your Grace may perhaps remember) volunteered to
remain behind on the field, for the purpose of succouring the wounded
Russians, accompanied only by his servant, PATRick MAGRATH.
For five days these two, unaided, buried the dead, comforted and
relieved the wounded, braved the dangers of marauding Cossacks, and
all the privations which circumstances rendered inevitable, such as
want of food, fuel, medical stores, and shelter. To the hardships then
encountered so nobly DR. THoMPson fell a victim, having been carried
9ff by cholera soon after joining his regiment at Balaklava. I have not
inquired whether DR. Thompson has left behind him . relations or
connections dependent upon him. Your Grace may be able to ascertain
this: if he have, and the rules of the Service do not interpose any
obstacle, I venture to suggest that some slight mark of your Grace’s
appreciation of an act of heroism which some consider one of the most
sublime of the many, to which this campaign has given occasion, would
neither be misplaced in relation to the Service itself, nor begrudged by
the British Nation. I would also beg to recommend PATRICKMAGRATH
for promotion, if he be still alive. - -
. If your Grace should consider that I am not introducing a dangerous
| innovation; in devoting to the humbler grades of the Service so large a
space as I have done in this despatch, I shall endeavour in future, to
obtain information, through Divisional, Brigade, and Regimental
Officers, acts of conspicuous daring or intelligence, and shall
take the liberty of bringing them occasionally under your Grace's
notice, and through your Grace under that of HER Most GRAcious
MAJESTY, and the Country. I cannot, but feel, however, that some
furthur excuse may be required for so bold a departure from established
practice. I think such excuse may be found first, in the stimulus that
this practice, may give to recruiting for the regular army; and
secondly, in the effect that a more habitual recognition of the services
of Regimental Officers and Privates, may have, in depriving, the Cor-
respondents of the daily newspapers of a plausible plea for the length
...? minuteness of their communications.
The publicity given by these communications to the movements and
arrangements of the Allied Forces, is often very inconvenient. A
fuller and freer official recognition of merit, might often check the
unofficial proclamation of it, and I cannot think, after the fullest con-
sideration I have been able to give the subject, that the efficiency of
that portion of the army on whom fall the most harassing duties of
the war would be impaired, were more space given in the Commander-
in-Chief's despatches to their services, and less to those of the Staff—
though I should much lament if the latter should not, on all occasions,
be most fully recognised. - - -
I can never forget that, the best blood of England is being freely
ured out on the heights before Sebastopol, but I know that plebeian
lood, not less heroically shed, mingles with its stream ; and I humbly
submit that the names of those who, side by side, face death on the
field, may, without indecency, stand associated in the same despatch.
Waiting your Grace's instructions on the point above, -
I have the honour to be,"
Your Grace's most obedient servant,
To IIis Grace the Duke of Newcastle. RAGLAN.
Note.—Mr. Punch is glad to see that this admirable despatch has already pro-
duced its effect.
REMONSTRANCE WITH THE TOAD AND RAVEN.
| --- H! you are quite right my dear
Toad: what you croak is
perfectly true, Raven. Cer-
tainly we have not been so
successful in the war as
we could wish. Sweaborg,
in fulfilment of our antici-
pations, should have sur-
rendered when NAPIER held
up his finger, and Cronstadt
should have fallen before
the flourish of his walking
stick. The victories of
Alma and Inkermann ought
not to have been gained,
because the battles ought
never to have been fought.
MENschikoff and his army
ought to have been seized
with a panic at the sight
of the red coats, and to
have bolted as fast as
they were able, leaving all
their guns and ammunition
behind them. The walls of Sebastopol, had they accomplished our
hopes, would have crumbled at the blast of the British bugles.
LoRD RAGLAN would have kicked down Fort Alexander with his
foot, and GENERAL CANROBERT would have blown up Fort Constan-
time with a puff of a cigar. No doubt we are much disappointed by
the fact that the flags of the Allies are not at this moment flying over
St. Petersburg, and that the CzAR, having been obliged to eat dirt and
abdicate, is not now residing at the Star and Garter. That our desires
in these particulars have not been gratified is very vexatious.
However, suppose the Russians had razed an immense fortification,
in course of construction at John O'Groats; that they had burnt a
vast quantity of pitch and tar accumulated on our northern coasts;
that they had swept our flag from the seas, and shut up our fleets in
our harbours; that they had captured no end of our merchant vessels;
that they had effected a descent, in large force, on Malta, and were
maintaining their position there, besieging. Valetta, having done an
immense deal of mischief to the place, and being certaiu to take it
unless we put forth the whole might of the Empire, and very likely
indeed to take it in spite of that. Suppose they had already thrashed
us handsomely on our own territories, with enormous slaughter, in two
pitched battles, wherein every extraneous advantage was on our side,
and in one of which our numbers exceeded theirs in the ratio of five to
one. In short, suppose we had changed places with Russia: should
we like our position better then than we do now, or would our opinion
of ourselves partake more decidedly of the nature of small beer?' And
would you croak less or more?
Britannia, my Toads, is under circumstances of trial; circumstances
requiring an effort, my Ravens. But may we not venture to say, on
the whole, that Britannia—in her present interesting condition—is as
well as can be expected ?
A GREAT MAN.
º
LoRD DERBY has called Nicholas a great man.” Still, a great
man; although misusing his resources. Well, he is a great man, in
the like sense that MoLoch was a great idol. DAGON, too, was another
great idol: and yet, tumbling flat upon his fish face, he had his head
and hands dissevered. The “ º is a great lord,” chants the
Hottentot in his respect for the dead brute when, reverently approach-
ing the carcase, the savage cuts off the great lord’s trunk. The bear
is a great bear; for which reason let us do our best and speediest, if not
to knock him on the head, at least to cut—even to the roots—his
carnivorous claws.
- ===
A Bible Hero.
MR. BRIGHT has discovered in Nicholas a great patron of the
Bible! At the Rochdale Auxiliary Bible Society, the pacific member
for Manchester was very much hurt that the Rev. Hugh Stowell,
had spoken somewhat irreverently of the EMPEROR of Russia: it was
too bad. Consider the pious sacrifices of Nicholas ! Why, he had
remitted the duty upon Bibles imported into Russia to the amount of
between £300 and £400; and should be spoken of respectfully as a
subscriber to that amount. -
Tattoo £ s. d. upon the body of Satan, and there is a man in drab

Shells that Won't Shell Out.
CoMPLAINTs have reached our ears that the Shells in the Crimea are
not up to the mark, or at all events, when they do get up to the mark
at which they are aimed, they do very little damage. It is said that
when they reach the ground, they won't explode, and that when once
discharged they appear as if released from further service. It is rather
unfortunate that the shells should be made of such strong materials
that they will not break, a state of things that must be equally credi-
table to the manufacturer and satisfactory to the enemy.
Better for Mixing.
MR. SIDNEY HERBERT believes that in our allied battles—“while
we shall be acquiring the dash of the French, the French will be ac-
quiring the firmness of the English.” The Right Hon. Secretary might
as well have saidº while we hail be acquiring the feathers of the
eagle, the French will be acquiring the bones of the lion.” Can men
change their nationalities by rubbing coats together? In such way,
can red make blue, and blue red? But these Right Hon. Secretaries
are privileged to talk unlike philosophers.

probably be thinking of the sweets of home, and I beg, therefore, to
state that our firm is willing to place one hundred ounces of our

is packed in ounce papers for the convenience of the public, to whom

MEssks. SHADRAck, Brothers, propose to give the article above
mentioned the name of the RAGLAN Cigar, and those of the public who
may wish to show their sympathy with our brave army by smoking the

MEssrs. ShadRAck, Brothers, have not taken this course from any
motive of ostentatious generosity, but simply from a feeling º

“MR. EnitoR,-Anxious as we all must be for the preservation of our
lant heroes in the East, I think it is the duty of each to do his

Much will depend on the provisions within their reach, and it is clear
that nutritious articles, such as, potted soups, and jellies, in which I
deal, would be very acceptable. Hoping that my offer will be fºllowed
by others, I am prepared to pack up six dozen of my potted beef

Infinitesimal Warfare.
OUR Ministers are wrong, if they imagine they can allay the War
that is raging in the Crimea by Homoeopathy. We doubt if Sebastopol
is to be reduced by homoeopathic doses. LoRD ABERDEEN’s pre-
scription would, doubtless, be “a billionth of a grain of gunpowder, and
a quintillionth of the infusion of lead. The latter to be worked up into
a pill, of the size of a small bullet. The two to be well mixed, and
given to the Walls of Sebastopol three times a day.” We can only
assure his matronly Lordship that, after all there is nothing like the
| regular old practice; and, in a desperate case like the present, the
“SIR,-Among the necessities of our noble warriors encamped on larger and the more frequent the doses, the quicker will the complaint

A PRIVATE BOX FOR ENGLAND'S DEAR BOYS BEFORE SEBASTOPOL |
THE GREAT DEBATE NUISANCE.
WE confess we did not like the aspect of the Times on the morning
after the assembling of Parliament. It is bad enough for the country
to be at war with "Russia, but it is an aggravation of the evil to find
an attack made upon our patience by thirty-nine columns drawn up in
close order before us, at our very breakfast table. Finding it hopeless
to stand against such an overwhelming display of heavy and misty
material, such a massive charge of lead and smoke, we retired at once
under the shelter of a light column of advertisements.
We must really request Lord PALMERSTON to show his impartiality
by calling on the Houses of Parliament to consume their own smoke,
just as he would deal with any other factory; and thus he might put
an end to the noxious trade of speech-making. , We can assure his
Lordship, that with so much Parliamentary smoke before us at our
breakfast, we always suffer from the vapours. We do not see any
reat difficulty to be overcome in this case, for surely, when we find
onourable members sometimes ready to eat their own words, they
would not hesitate to consume their own smoke, or in some way get
| rid of the disagreeable result of their own speeches.
The Scotch Sunday Cab.
THE following touching incident is narrated in the Caledonian
Mercury:-
“While a cab was conveying an infirm lady to church yesterday morning the driver
was heartily hissed by a number of passengers in one of the leading thoroughfares of
the new town.”
. An infirm woman on her way to church hissed! Oh, Scotch piety!
is not thy symbol a goose?
WOMEN AT THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.
It is found that women make the best clerks for the Electric Tele-
graph. Very rarely, indeed, are, they at fault. The only difficulty is,
* P. each young lady at either end of the line from having the
A POCKET LAVATER.
IN the account of a sanguinary miscreant given by a contemporary,
we are informed that—
“The desperate character of the assassin may be gathered from the following list of
articles found upon him :—A pair of pistols (the barrels about six inches long,
24 cartridges, some percussion caps, a dagger, having a blade nine inches in length,
84d. in money, and a corkscrew.”
The first four of the above items, certainly, indicate that the gentle-
man on whose person they were found was a ruffian of some determi-
nation. That his character was of a desperate nature is strongly
suggested by the pistols, the cartridges, the percussion caps, and the
dagger. But it does not appear quite so plainly that his desperate
character could in any measure be gathered from his possession of
eightpence-halfpenny in money, unless it could be proved that the
sum he had in his poeket was all he had in the world. The cork-
screw would rather intimate that this was not the case: as it is an
implement which a person only worth eightpence-halfpenny would be
likely to have no occasion for. Perhaps, however, the preachers of
total abstinence will consider that anybody must be in a desperate state
who carries a corkscrew. -
Blood of the Grape.
IN a sick soldier's letter from Scutari, he writes—that he has had,
among other comforts, “a gill of port wine every day, which has some-
what pulled me up, after the quantity of blood I left at Balaklava.”
We understand that the Temperance people are about to assemble at
Exeter Hall; calling the attention of the Government to the fact; and
further expressing their confidence in the Ministry, so long, as the
soldiers being debarred of wine, the war shall be carried on at home
through the usual pump.
DIVISION OF LABOUR.
It is calculated that if every well-to-do lady would only make and
subscribe one flannel shirt for the men wintering in the Crimea, that
the men will, on their part, be able to make a capital shift.

THE CHARACTER OF MENSCHIKOFF
(Judging of him from the absurd way in which he goes on at Astley’s.)
N appearance MEN-
schikoff is rather
short, but a wonderful
cocked-hat that he
wears with an enor-
mous jet d'eau of
feathers that shoots
up to some height,
and then falls in
green spray upon his
shoulders, makes the
Prince appear much
taller than he really
is. His coat is of a
lightmalachite colour,
and with proper mili-
tary precaution it is
buttoned close up to
his throat, MENscHI-
Koff knowing very
well that a General's
first duty is to cover
well his front. This
spinach-coloured gar-
ment is elegantly
balanced with a pair of glittering epaulettes, as yellow and almost as
big, as birdcages, and, which hang on... each side of him like the
paniers thrown over a donkey's back... His large breast is punctuated
with every possible order, and these diamonds, stops and notes of ad-
miration follow one another in a straight line in regular succession,
like the long row of bells we see in a i. -house, when, by accident,
we go down into the kitchen. He wearsjack boots worthy of a French
Postilion, and has long buff-gloves that reach nearly up to his elbow,
and which he is continually pulling back, as though he were afraid that,
like the Russian soldiers, they were going every minute to run away.
The manner of PRINCE MENschIKOFF, we regret to say, is not much
more dignified than his appearance. He storms, raves, blusters, and
throws his arms and legs about as º as the Uncle just arrived
from India does in one of the fine old English comedies. e is, most
liberal too, with his stamps, counting you out at least a shilling's-
In fact, it must be confessed that the General gives
way to passion worse than any spoilt child. He shouts so loud that
we should be very sorry to be his next door neighbour, and his
behaviour to the servants is so brutal, that we wonder he ever can get
one to stop with him. St. VLADIMIR have pity on the poor fellow who
has to pull off his boots, when the Prince happens to be in a passion-
which, by the by, seems to happen pretty nearly all the time. His
favourite way of impressing an order on the understanding of any one
is by kicking him—a kick when the order is given, and another kick
when the order is brought back executed. . It is MENschIKQFF's
customary method of salutation: instead of taking off his cocked hat
to any one, he kicks him.
His humour is not considerable, but it is very peculiar. It" consists
that is uttered,
and though the extreme facetiousness of this brilliant saying loses
somewhat on constant repetition, still it comes in with great happiness
y, Or
haranguing the troops. -
Another phase of his humour lies in giving utterance to statements
of the most Siberian coolness, and advancing them as truths. Thus, a
defeat is always paraded as a victory, and a drummer, who is taken
risoner, is instantly magnified into a Field-Marshal; Tens become
#. hundreds soon grow into thousands, and the loss of a picquet
is equivalent with him to the slaughter of an entire army—of course,
when the loss is on his own side. These propensities, however, are very
diverting, and in a country where all, from the EMPEROR downwards,
are represented as habitual liars, the one man who stood up for the
which you would im
truth whilst every one else was lying, would certainly appear very sin-
gular, and would probably be put down.
However, the worst point in MR. MENschikoff’s character is his in-
veterate cowardice. You do expect bravery in a Commanding General,
and we always thought MENschikoff was brave, but it is no such thing.
He is only a brane Belge in his bravery. The sound of cannon, to
ine he had got by this time tolerably well accus-
tomed, sets him off shaking worse than any closet of china, and the
sight of an English or French uniform makes him vanish with a speed
that is highly comical. If he hears the enemy is coming one way, he
runs instantly in the opposite direction, and the only wonder is that
e remains in the Crimea at all. -
We can only say, that if"PRINCE MENscHIKopp is the great simpleton,
the great lº, the great coward, the great liar, the great nin-
compoop, that he is so plainly represented at Astley's for our amuse-
ment to be, he decidedly deserves a large share of the kicks he is
so liberal in distributing to others.
THE MODEL BAL MASQUE.
THAT pleasant réunion of the respectable classes, and the better orders
morally as well as socially, the annual Bal Masqué at Drury Lane, came
off under the auspices of M. JULLIEN, this year, with all its customary
gaiety tempered by refinement. Amid the merry, but decorous throng,
we noticed several families of professional gentlemen and tradesmen, as
well as persons of higher rank; and many men, whom we personally
knew, had brought their sisters. The costumes were such as are
usually seen at a fancy-dress ball; but, generally speaking, of a less
violent and obtrusive character: and exhibited, in their #. materials, and
workmanship, the appearance of having been made for theoccasion, rather
than that of being hired from a Masquerade Warehouse. This circum-
stance deprived that contact with the wearers, which is inevitable in a
crowded assembly, of the unpleasantness necessarily communicated by
garments that have been wornby allmanner of persons iºiº.
condition, and that have most probably been stewing under an
oleaginous heap of frippery, in the repository of a Hebrew inattentive
to cleanliness.
Many of the young men wore plain black suits and white ties: and
though some of those youths, thanks to the early closing movement,
may have been linen-drapers' assistants, a greater proportion evidently
were of the aristocracy, and not a few, who abstained from actually
dancing, had all the appearance of curates. A Bishop occupied a
private-box among the spectators.
Some of the characters were very cleverly sustained, and lively, yet
polished repartee, attended with genial, but never boisterous, mirth,
was the order of the evening. The general, tone of the assembly was
that of perfect ease, and perfect propriety; the unrestrained and correct
expression of amiability and animal spirits. The refreshments were of
an exquisite º and a mild and innocent nature. Subdued, and
uiet magnificence was the pervading character of the decorations.
he utmost urbanity ºil. and after a light and moderate supper,
the company separated at a comparatively early hour.
It is a pity that an opportunity of enjoying this delightful and unob-
jectionable species of entertainment is not more frequently afforded to
young men, desirous of combining an evening's rational amusement
with improvement in the graces, and exercise in the courtesies and
decencies of life.
A CHRISTMAS CAROL FOR THE CRIMEA.
O CHIVALRY of England! ye lion-hearted men, -
Encamped upon the heights above the Russian Robber's den,
If not a merry Christmas, a glorious one at least,
You’ll spend while on those cold bleak hills you hold your slender
east.
But not a man amongst you can more heartily desire
. Here with his friends that he could be beside a blazing fire,
Than we do, safe at home, who eat our pudding and our beef
In peace-thank you, and such as you brave fellows and your chief.
Officers of Distinction.
Wisdom at Head, Quarters has decorated our Officers with a
distinctive uniform and plumes of white feathers. This arrangement
answers its purpose...yery well by day, but it is of no use at night.
Therefore, in any military operation that has to be performed after
dark, it would be advisable that every British Officer should wear a
lighted lantern on the top of his helmet or cap, and also a blazing bull's-
eye on his left breast. Thus the Officer, by night as well, as by day,
would bid the enemy defiance, and dare his ability to hit,the target or
send a shot through the bull's-eye.
Charley's (mot) my Darling.
SIR CHARLEs NAPIER in his telegraphic address to the electors of
Marylebone, takes for his watchword “War to the knife with Russia.”
It is all very well for “Old Charley” to talk about “War to the
Knife,” just as he is about to “cut it.”
PIGS FOR A WRONG MARKET.
NINETY tons of pig-lead, shipped for Prussia, have been stopped, to
the dismay of his Majesty, as contraband of war. SHAKSPEARE speaks
of the “mobled Queen.”. Future commentators (the race is equal to
anything) may read—“Pig-lead King.”

“Now, DoN'T You 'URRY THE HANDANTY (ANdA wre) THIS TIME,
'17), THE ARTIST CROSSING SWEEPER.
THE Artist Crossing Sweeper continues to attend at
his studio opposite St. James's Palace; but we regret that
the patronage of the cognoscenti is not as yet commensurate
with the results of genius. He is, however, beginning to
be recognised by “the profession,” and we saw him the
| other day surrounded by a small party of brothers of the
brush—or besom—who were regarding “the anchor,”
(which he had completed in a relief of thick mud) with
intense interest. W. trust that the youthful genius, who
has been the first to apply the arts to the ordinary street
refuse, will soon attract the eye of some friend to talent,
who will take it by the hand, and drag it out of the dirt at
the first convenient opportunity.
We cannot help thinking that the same taste which
directs the birchbroom might be applied with success to |
the pencil, and though we do not mean to claim for our
young protégé the future of a Joshua REYNoLDs, we feel
that the actual condition of a Jack Rag is hardly worthy
of his merits. His favourite design at present is the anchor
—the emblem of Hope—which we trust is not destined to
be dashed by the rude waves of adversity, or the chilling
winds of neglect which are perhaps less endurable.
A Task for the Enemy.
FROM the enormous length of most of the speeches on
the Address, it appears that Parliament means to go on
talking this Session as heretofore. At the H. time, the
length of Parliamentary speeches may perhaps be excused,
on the ground that not only are their hearers and readers
bored by them, but the EMPEROR OF Russia; also, has the
trouble of reading them through. It is sincerely to be hoped
that every debate will sicken him, and give him a headach.
THE WESTMINSTER REPRESENTATION.
WHEN we say that Westminster may be .# complimented on the
excellence of its representation, it will be found that we intend to pay
no compliment to its present, representatives in Parliament. The
representation to which we allude has not been ensured by the electors
of Westminster, but by the “elections” of Westminster School, where
the Eunuchus of TERENCE has been lately represented in a very able
and efficient manner.
The Eunuchus has been generally described as a comedy, but we
think it may be classified, with greater fitness, under the category of |
broad—exceedingly broad—farce. Its breadth is indeed far more
noticeable than its depth, for the plot is of the shallowest, and the only
deepness we can find, is that of the scampish man-about-town, Gnatho,
upon whom the wei ht of what is called the "comic business”. prin-
cipally devolves. We say emphatically “weight,” for the levities of
the part are not a little J.; and rather lead us to suspect that
; ancient Roman audience had but feeble powers of appreciating a
Joke.
Viewed indeed as a dramatic composition, we cannot understand by
what process of vitality the Eunuchus should have not only survived its
night of first production, but have maintained its existence through
near a score of centuries to “be received with applause” in this
enlightened nineteenth. The º: is indescribable (at least in these
pages) and were it not for the life which the youthful actors somehow
manage to throw into them, half the jokes which enliven it would, we
fancy, fall as dead as the language in which they are written. In short,
there is no principle, and but little interest: and the only really striking
situation in the piece, is that where Parmeno gets his ears boxed.
| Nevertheless, its intrinsic merits notwithstanding, the play has been
revived at Westminster with complete success. And perhaps it is
| lucky for us that we possess a LoRD CHAMBERLAIN, for such is, the
fashion just now for translating anything that has been anywhere
| Successful, that we should probably soon be having the Banuchus
“adapted from the Latin,” but inasmuch as it would puzzle the
cleverest “old Westminster” to translate the Eunuchus, so that decent
ears might listen to it, we think we may rest satisfied that its sonorific
witticisms will be confined, appropriately, to the dormitory at West:
minster, where their production once a twelvemonth, for a season of
three nights cannot, certainly, do much harm, and may tend in some
degree to the prevention of that puerile dulness which “all work and no
Play” is proverbial to ensure.

THE GHOST OF COBBETT TO THE EARL OF
ABERDEEN.
“ABERDEEN,+Just look here,
will you? I have been read-
ing your Speech. When I
say your Speech, I mean
that which you concocted,
and which CRAN worth,
your precious Chancellor,
presented to the QUEEN
that she might read it to
the Lords, Commons,
Women, and Reporters,
on Tuesday last. The
UEEN, of course, had no-
thing to do with the com-
position, and º you,
with your national impu-
dence, will accuse me of
disrespect to her, you know
that * mean nothing of
the kind. I am writing to
gou, and about you, Old
Woman.
“You never had so good
an oppol tunity of writing
a Speech in which strong
things could properly be
said in a strong manner.
You might have blown a trumpet, and have set English blood in a
flame with the music. You have preferred to squeak upon a penny
whistle, and to squeak out of tune. The Speech is the very worst
that ever was delivered. However, I shall confine myself to a notice
of its bad grammar.
“You cannot get through the first line without a Scotch mull.)
“‘I have called you together at this UNUsual period of the year.'
- “What do you mean by that, eh? Why is the period of the year
unusual Is it unusual to have winter, or to have December, or to
have a twelfth of December * The period is not unusual. What I
suppose you meant was, that it is unusual for Parliament to meet in
December. Then why could you not say so? Why not have written,
“The period ‘....} at which I have called you together (a vulgar
phrase) is an unusual one.’
“Well, you go on—
"'That by your assistance I may take such measures' [With your assistance]" as will
enable me to prosecute the great war in which we are engaged with the utmost vigour.”
We are not engaged in the war with the utmost vigour., What
you mean is, that, you want measures by means, of which the war
may be prosecuted with the utmost vigour, not that you do, but you
wished QUEEN VICTORIA to say that you do. Then why not write
down for her what you meant?
“‘I cannot doubt that you share my conviction of the necessity of sparing no effort to
augment my forces now engaged in the Crimea.'
“This is not ungrammatical, but a weaker, sloppier phrase for the
description of a strong act was never devised. But you cannot long
adhere even to such English as that.
“‘The exertions THEY have made' [mean writing—why not have said, which my
soldiers have made 2) “and the victories they have obtained are not exceeded in the brightest
pages of history.'
“How can exertions and victories be exceeded in pages? Exertions
(you had better have made a few) are the acts of men, pages are paper,
and it is sheer slipslop which brings them together as if they were
things of the same nature. ...What you meant, was, that ‘the brightest
pages” (Minerva Press) of history record nothing exceeding in merit
and glory the exertions,’ &c.
“'The hearty and ºfficient co-operation of the brave troops of my ally, the EMPERon of
THE FRExch, and the glory,’ &c.
“Co-operation with whom or what? Do you mean that the troops
co-operated with each other? Of course they did, but you do not
mean that. But you do not say with whom they co-operated. Why
not have said that they co-operated with ‘my forces?” Because
you write like a Lord, that is to say, abominably.
“But this co-operation with nobody
“‘Cannot fail to cement still more closely’ [than what?] ‘the union which happily
subsists between the two countries' [what two #1
“Slipslop, again! Do you know what cement is? Or do you know
what a union is? A union means an accomplished fact, to use Gallican
|...}} How can more cement be used after a union? My brick-
ayer's apprentice could teach you better.
“‘I have also concluded a treaty with America, by which sus, ºfficult
discussion have been adjusted.' y , by to Rots of long and diffic
“Even an American would have written better English. Adjust a
subject QUESTIONs, you meant, I presume.
“‘I trust that other matters [mean, again, of great INTEREST and importance to THE
general welfare will not be neglected.'
“Interest to the general welfare I do not entirely approve of
flogging, I strongly disapprove of flogging women (your friend and ally
the Austrian, thinks differently), and I should shudder to flog an Öid
Woman. So you are safe. But such a sentence ought to ensure to a
lad of fourteen, a whipping which would make even your House of Lords
cushion no easy seat, “Subjects (again) of interest to the general
welfare l’
“Now, ABERDEEN, do not, with your impudence, say that I find
fault for the sake of finding fault. I can praise, when people
deserye praise. The last paragraph in your. Speech is very decent,
and I believe that BILLY GLADstoNE wrote it. The statement, that
Parliament exhibits the example of a united people would be rubbish
but for its clever , subtlety, which implies (a lie) that Parliament
represents the people. The last sentence is vulgarly clumsy, “thus
and the “trust’ having no connection. But the sentiment is unex-
ceptionable, so I quote the passage:– -
“I feel assured that in the momentous contest in which we are engaged you will exhibit
to the world the example of a united people. Thus shall we obtain the respect of other
nations, and may trust that by the blessing of God we shall bring the war to a successful
termination.'
“I trust that we shall. But we shall not, while the country tolerates
you as Prime Minister.
“I remain, ABERDEEN,

The Question is-Why do they do it?
A PARISIAN Critic, possessed of no mean allowance of brain, and
gifted with the longest beard, lamenting lately over the fearful increase
of Tragedies, is at a loss to account for the strange infirmity. He
cannot understand how so many human beings can be found year after

in this world he cannot imagine anything easier than not to write a

A Great Man in his Own Way.
A Noble Lord considers that the CzAR is a great man, but going in

ness which was conspicuous in JonATHAN WILD THE GREAT. That
he is going in a wrong direction is more than doubtful: there is no
question that, he is going to his own place, except that everybody’s
question is, where can he expect to go to ?

SIR John MANDEVILLE tells us of divers isles in the Perilous
Valley that is a part of the golden cloud-land of PRESTER JOHN. Now
beyond this vale is a great isle inhabited by giants... And these giants
have been seen to board ships, taking men out of them and bringing
them to land, “two in one hand, and two in the other, eating them
going, all raw and alive.”. Even as men would º the pulpy flesh of
a new fig. Men built of mere flesh and blood, the mortal.unmixed

it to the letter: we cannot but do so; for every, week here, in the
Perilous Valley of London, the fog-and-smoke-land, of Presbyter

SIBTHORPE'S POSITION.
AMONG the few matters that tended to enliven what was
in other respects a rather dull debate on the Militia Bill,
the most amusing incident was the inquiry of Colon EL
SIBThoRPE what would be his position after the passing
of the measure. LoRD PALMERston recommended the
“home circle” to the gallant Colonel, as his most appro-
priate sphere of usefulness. Certainly, “SIBThorpe at
home,” offers a rich field—much richer than the battle field
—for the contemplation of those who are familiar with the
gallant Colonel’s peculiarities. . We are quite sure, never-
theless, that he would act with becoming bravery before
REHEARSING FOR THE CRIMEA IN ST. JAMES'S PARK.
“Now THEN, MATE, HERE comes AN ORFINCEER.
PRESEND HARMBs "
PASS TIME OF THE PEERS.
THE ofber evening a considerable portion of the time of the House
of Lords was occupied in the discussion of the important question,
whether a noble Lord’s argument had been *. erly described as
“absurd,” and whether some other noble Lord º been really guilty
of uttering “degrading” and “debasing” sentiments. It seems to
us rather immaterial With: their Lordships were right or wrong in
abusing one another; but it is undoubtedly wrong that they should
waste what is usually termed “ the time of the country” in an enquiry
whether the coarse language used by the Peers was appropriate to the
objects against which it was directed. Their Lordships may rest
assured that the nation does not insist on any explanation, but will
be jº satisfied to take it for granted that both sides thoroughly
deserved all the abuse they got from each other."
The discussion went off into an, if possible, still more unprofitable
discussion, as to “what would have been the late SIR. Robert PEEL's
opinion” on some question or other. There will be no end to a debate
if the opinions of dead statesmen are to be made the subject of a post-
mortem examination, and the house may as well resolve itself into an
inquest for the purpose of sitting on the debates of former days, if these
subjects are to be disinterred for the guidance of living statesmen.
The discussion on what SIR Robert PEEL would have thought might
have been got rid of by an amendment, roposing a Select Committee
to enquire and, if possible, ascertain, “What will MRs. GRUNDY say?”
A Safe Guess.
If the American President had to send his “Messages” by the
Electric Telegraph, and pay so much for so many words, we guess
rather that he would not make them so tarnation long.
A SPECIAL DEMURRER.—In spite of MR, SIDNEY HERBERT's con-
tribution to the Ministerial defence fund, it is easy to prove that the
Government has been guilty of some short-coming, as the reinforce-
ments have been so long-going. -

be pretty well known to the Members of the Government.
With characteristic straightforwardness these charges are
always face to face, and he is not one of those who are
addicted to the cowardice of wounding an enemy, or more
properly speaking, an opponent when his back is turned.
e admire the tact with which the Colonel effected a
diversion in his own favour, for when told that the best
place for him was his own home, and by implication that
he ought to be in bed instead of in the House of Commons,
he discharged one of those pieces of light artillery which
are always sure to tell, by giving notice, that “on a future
occasion he should take an opportunity of moving the

MR. BRIGHT’S NEW WORD.
According to the Morning Post MR. BRIGHT says that
“The populace are running red-hot after something that will turn out to be a
Will-o'-the-Wisp and a delusion.”
In urging on the war, MR. BRIGHT means. . But what does he mean
by the Populace: We did not know that there was such a word in
MR. BRIGHT's book. Is it possible that he means those whom he used
to denominate the People * Does he intend to say that they are now
running after a Will-o'-the-Wisp who used to run after himself?
Having fallen out with his friends, does he now abuse them and call
them names P. Or has a large fortune come to him, or has his right to
some peerage in abeyance turned up that he mow speaks so contemp-
tuously of the Masses and the Million—termed more correctly the
upwards of Twenty Million ? Really we may expect shortly to hear
MR. BRIGHT calling the British Public the Oi IIoMAol, the Herd, the
Vulgar, the Great Unwashed, the Mob, the Riff-raft, the Tag Rag and
Bobtail. MR. BRIGHT ought to get himself proposed at the Carlton
Club, and introduced at Almack's. -

SUGGESTION FOR MATRIMONIAL ADVERTISERS.
ONE thing was forgotten by the gentleman who put the following
advertisement into the Morning Posł:-
ATRIMONY.—A GENTLEMAN, good-looking, aged 28, possessed
of an income of £300 per annum, is desirous of meeting with a Lady of respec-
tability, and possessing an income of at least £100 per annum. Being himself of an
amiable disposition, he has no doubt that, to a Lady of congenial habits, he is in a
position to offer a comfortable and happy home. His intentions are straightforward
and honourable, and his moral character will bear the strictest investigation. The
utmost secrecy will be observed.
This gentleman forgot to stipulate that a full length photograph of
the party desirous to treat with him should accompany her tender.
lady “possessing an income of at least £100 a year,” is an article of
such demand in the market that any goods of the kind remaining on
hand may be presumed to be damaged or defective. Much needless
negociation would be precluded if the hundred pounds desirous of
ng themselves to the three hundred would transmit a correct
likeness of themselves to that sum. What a pretty collection of
miniatures three hundred, or the gentlemen who corresponds to the
amount, would get !
To advertise for a wife of £100 a year, indeed, would be a capital
way to obtain a gallery of natural caricatures. Every ugly variety
of the nose, irregularity of the mouth, aberration of the eyes from the
axis of vision, deflexion, contortion, emaciation, or tumefaction of the
figure; every species of disfigurement and blemish: would be illustrated
in the replies to such an advertisement. All hope of beauty would be
out of the question for the author of the above: the ruddiest ringlets,
with tolerable form and features, plus £100 per annum, are quoted at far
above £300 ditto. Grey, in combination with venerable good looks,
would be his only chance: or the semblance of youth, exhibited by the
"...". would be found, on inspection of the original, to be due to
a fallacy contrived by a TRUEFITT.
A Puff Clothed in 40,000 Great Coats.
SOME of the papers have been publishing with an amount of iteration
that smacks of the advertising columns—an account of an offer to
supply, 10,000 great coats-at cost price—for iétroops in the Crimea.
The offer was, in spite of its magnanimity, declined by the Government,
who had already contracted for a supply of coats, and therefore thé
40,000 at cost price will have to remain on hand.
We do not exactly see the grounds on which the “thanks of the
Government” have been given to a tradesman, for an 'offer by which
nothing has been obtained, and MR. Sidney Herpent in conveying
them, has only illustrated the old saying of “thank you for nothing.”
A POST-MORTEM PUFFER.
SoMERopy advertises a “Resilient Boddice or Corsaletto di Medici.”
We should think this must be a very inconvenient article, for inasmuch
as, “Resilient”, means...leaping up again, the Boddice in question
must be one that it is difficult, if not impossible, to keep in its proper
osition. The term “Corsaletto di Medici.” is rather puzzling, for if
it is meant to be suggestive of the beauty of form of the WENUs DE
MEDICI, we are per lexed by the recollection that the Venus alluded
to wears no “Corsaletto” of any kind, or any “boddice” “resilient,”
or otherwise. The advertisement, contains an “opinion of the press”
on the high authority of the “Editor of the Courier.” Considering
A that the “Courier” has been dead these eight years, the office of Editor
must be a bit of a sinecure; and, indeed, we should like to see the
shadowy, being who fills it, for though a newspaper might possibly
exist without an Editor, we cannot fancy the existence of an Editor
without a journal. The Editor of the Courier, however, seems to have
been so impressed, during his actual Editorship, with the value of the
Resilient Boddice, that now in the days of his Editorial ghosthood, he
wanders about exclaiming (in the words of the extract), “All whom
we have any influence over shall in future wear them.” We should
really like, by way of curiosity, to have a return of the names of all
over whom }. Editor of the Čourie. (a journal which died eight years
; and sºld its own carcase, by anticipation, to the Globe)—has “any
uence.’
SIX OFFICERS ROLLED INTO ONE.
TALK of the work our troops have to do in the Crimea —what is
that to the spiritual labour which has to be performed by the Reverend
gentleman named in the following paragraph from the Daily News f
“A PLURALIST.-The REv. C. A. Thurlow, who has just been appointed to the
Chancellorship of Chester diocese, has at present on his hands the duties of the ſol-
lowing offices 3–Rector of Malpas (worth £1000 a year), prebendary of York Cathedral,
rural dean of Malpas, canon of Chester, and chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury.”
Fancy the same officer being Commissary, Colonel, Major, Captain,
Adjutant, and Aide-de-camp. If he discharged the duties of all these
commissions effectually, perhaps he would not enjoy too high a remu-
neration in receiving the pay of each. The same may be said of the
officer in the Church-Militant, who is supposed to do the duties of
half-a-dozen clergymen..., But is that supposition, tenable?, Can the
Reverend gentleman divide himself into six, retaining his vitality as if
he were an earthworm: or can he preach or officiate in so many places
at Qnce? If so, we must not quarrel with the Pope for expecting us to
believe prodigies and propositions which are contrary to common
Sense.

| of a
THE DENOMINATION OF KING CLICQUOT.
º CLIcQUoT was not
º º - this monarch's
original name. If
you wish to dis-
cover that, see
Punch's "Pocket.
Book for 1855,
“Sovereigns of
” page 2.
It is generally
– known that the
= name of CLIcQUOT
E was given to his
E Majesty, by his
= Majesty's Im-
erial Brother-in-
aw, by reason of
his Majesty's ex-
= treme fondness
S for the exquisite,
§ but intoxicating,
beverage so deno-
minated.
It is not, how-
- ever, generally
known that Nicholas, besides being the Godfather who gave KING
CLIcQUoT that name, was also the Priº who christened him thereby.
But as NICHOLAS has created himself. Pope of the Greek
Church—and he really is the successor of PETER—it is not at all
wonderful that he should have taken it upon himself to perform
the priestly operation of christening, which we suppose, he did in
the case of CLIcQuot, according to the rite practised by young
ladies in christening ships. That is to say, that, NICHOLAs, in
christening his royal relative, CLIcQUOT, flung a bottle of the wine
so called against his person. Nicholas is subject to fits of frantic
rage; like the bull, and other brutes. In one of these he has been
known—as an eyewitness states—to transfix, with his sword, the foot
of an officer who had offended him, and pin it to the ground. . To such
a potentate it would be a mere trifle to throw bottles. He has since
pooh-poohed CLICQUQT, in the most contemptuous manner; and
Clicquot has endured this insolence with such meekness that, there
can be no doubt he would stand any outrage at the hand of NICHOLAs,
or even at his foot. - - -
But, strangely enough, although CLICQUOT has been twice christencil,
there is good reason to believe that if his own feelings had been con:
º in the matter of christening, he never would have been christened
at all.
Some years ago CLIcQUOT came over to this country: on the occasion
rand christening, by the by. Fº the external splendours
attendant on the ceremony, savoured, to his thinking, too much of
pomps and vanities, and thus impressed his mind with an objection, to
it. However, if we remember rightly, KING CLICQUQT, about this
time paid a visit to Newgate in º with a celebrated Female
Member of the Society of Friends, and thus accompanied went down
upon his knees then and there, and performed his devotions in a public
manner, much less, it is to be feared, to the edification, than to the
astonishment, of the beholders.
It is impossible not to recall this remarkable demonstration on the
part of Clicquot in connexion with what might be called the extremely
pacific tendency of his late policy, if that policy, by reason of its
timorousness and indecision had not mainly contributed to bring on
the war. Still Peace was his object: Peace, at any price—except a
pecuniary price. NICHOLAs, besides having nicknamed him CLICQUOT,
calls him the Angel of Peace. This brings us back to CLIcQUoT's
christening, with the reason why we apprehend he had rather not have
been christened, which must now be apparent. Take his sympathetic
exhibition at Newgate with that which he is now making, to the
admiration of MR. BRIGHT and MR. Cobden, and the scorn-of Europe.
Put this and that together, and then say if it is not clear beyond all
controversy that KING CLIcquot is—a Quaker'
This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the influence which
at present actuates his Majesty occasions on his part phenomena
corresponding to those which were manifested by the primitive Quakers,
and procured them that title. His vacillation or quaking of purpose is
notorious.
Our own correspondent is instructed to observe the costume worn by
KING CLICQUQT at his next appearance in public: for we expect that
he will soon display himself in his true colours, namely drab ditto,
without buttons, and with a broad brimmed hat.
One qualification, however, must be added to the inference that
CLIcquot has turned Quaker. Not long ago, as all the world knows, he
ran up against an apple tree in his orchard, and barked his nose. From
this, besides other false steps, and courses of an indirect and devious
kind, the conclusion is inevitable that, if KING CLIcquot has joined the
Society of Friends, his MAJESTY is what is termed a Wet Quaker.
RELIEF FOR THE DESTITUTE.
It is the beautiful theory of the law that every destitute person in
this country may claim relief; but the most charming theory may often
have its beauty marred by very ugly features. A destitute person may
indeed claim relief, just as a pauper may order a dinner at the London
Tavern, but the claim in the one case may meet with as little attention
as the order in the other. The principle adopted in some of the metro-
politan parishes with regard to destitution, is simply to drive it away,
and if poverty were a wolf at the door, there could not be greater
anxiety to keep it off than is usually displayed by the authorities at a
workhouse. A family of starving infants supplies the materials for an
active game of “None of my child,” between the relieving officers of
neighbouring parishes, “You don't belong to us,” cries Saint George,
“you must ; to, Whitechapel; ”.. and, on arrival there, the weary
†: perhaps hears the repudiation by Whitechapel of a burden
that is re-directed to Rotherhithe. -
Supposing the place for relief to be at last reached, the question
arises of what relief shall be given. This is a subject for the discretion
of the relieving officer; but, judging by some recent police reports,
this “discretion ” is sometimes exercised in a very remarkable manner.
A few days ago a destitute female applied at the door of a metropolitan
workhouse at seven o'clock on a cold winter's evening, and wanted a
night's lodging. ...The relieving officer, in the exercise of his “dis-
cretion,” offered “a piece of bread” as a substitute for shelter. The
ideas of a relieving officer are no doubt original; but we should like to
ask him, if he is a married man, what he would think of the wag who,
in the event of his (the relieving officer's wife) being out shivering in
the cold at seven o’clock on a winter's evening, should offer her a
portion of a loaf by way of shelter and bedding. If a slice of bread is
facetiously proposed as a substitute for a mattrass, and a piece of crust
is humorously offered instead of a roof, we can only say the joke is the
very worst it was ever our misfortune to light upon.
We heartily commend SIR RoBERT CARDEN, for having inflicted a
penalty on a relieving officer who had presented “bread” to a poor
destitute creature, without a place in which to lie her head on a
winter's evening. The officer paid the penalty “under protest,” and if
he relies upon some quibble of law, we do not doubt he will find some
learned authority, or other to agree with him, in maintaining any
absurdity that will exempt him from the legal liability to support a
pauper not “belonging to the parish.” Great credit is due to SIR
Roseat CARDEN for the boldness with which he adopted the side of
common sense and common humanity, at the risk of ºf Common
law opposed to him. If the relieving officer should bring his action,
SIR RöBERT may appeal with confidence to the Superior Court of his
.ºntº, in which, at all events, his good action will be quite
Justliled.
1)ANGERS OF FINE WRITING.
IN these days of common sense “fine writing” is rather a dangerous
experiment. We experienced the truth of this the other day, when
erusing a rather spirited, but somewhat inflated letter, signed W.
APIER, we came to a passage, which, at the first glance, read to us
as follows:– -
“Makes England snore and stare like a warehouse in the midst of cartage.”
Having taken a second look at this rather stunning sentence, we
found it to run thus:—
“Makes England snort and start like a war-horse in the midst of carnage.”
| If a more familiar style of expression had been adopted, and the
writing had not been quite so fine, this little mistake would probably
not have happened.
OUR FULL COLONELS.
| IN the course of the Debate on the Militia Bill our friend SIRTHORPE
exclaimed that he “had the honour of being a full Colonel.” We were
aware that the Colonel was tolerably full of something or other, for
there is not a night passes without his showing that he is full even to
brimming over in the House of Commons. Fulness may be accom;
plished in various ways, and BACON says, “that º, makes a full
|man;" though we doubt if this is the way in which the gallant
Colonel’s “fulness” has been acquired. Considering, the amusing
part he takes in the performances of the house, we think the programme
might be headed appropriately with the words–
