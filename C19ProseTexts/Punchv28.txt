MR:
R. PUNCH, desiring that the Right Book should be in the Right Place, has given orders for the
dissemination of this his Twenty-Eighth Volume throughout the world; but especially in those places
where the Solidity of his Wisdom, the Brilliancy of his Wit, the Sweetness of his Benevolence, and the
Loving-kindness of his Nature in All Things, should best manifest themselves to the World at Large
through the World's Rulers and Misrulers, shining through them upon the peoples, even as the Sun
shines through the crystal of the Palace and the lattice of the Cottage.
LORD Cowley has been directed to present the Volume-bound in peach-blossom satin,-to the
EMPRESS EUGÉNIE ; that, further recommended by her looks and speech, the right precepts of Mr. Punch
may, to the abiding benefit of France and England, flourish in the right places.
LORD BLOOMFIELD, at Berlin, has been accredited with his Copy (bound in boar-skin), to present
to the King of Prussia. His Lordship has been further directed to read certain edifying verses charitably
composed for the better instruction of the King of PRUSSIA, to be administered early in the morning.
The EARL OF WESTMORELAND, at Vienna (leaving his fiddle at home), will forthwith take his
Punch (bound in GORDON plaid) to FRANCIS JOSEPH, the “Hope of Austria ”-according to LORD
ABERDEEN. (“Hope told a flattering tale,” and Britannia was fool enough to believe it.)
LORD H. DE WALDEN, at Brussels, will present his Punch (bound in Russia) to LEOPOLD,
requesting His Majesty not to forget that he is the Uncle of the QUEEN OF ENGLAND, and by no
means vassal to the EMPEROR ALEXANDER II. His Lordship has been further desired to present to His
Majesty an English red rose gathered in the gardens of Claremont, as a further refresher of His
Majesty's memory.

PREFACE.
Lord HOWDEN, at Madrid, will demand an audience of Queen Isabella to present Her Majesty
with his Punch (bound in Spanish Bonds). His Lordship is further desired to express his readiness to
read to Her Majesty four pages per diem for the illumination of the Royal mind, and through her to
the enlightenment of Spain in general.
Sir R. PAKENHAM, at Lisbon, will deliver his Punch to Don Pedro immediately upon His
Majesty's return. The volume is most pathetically bound. The brave Bohemian Ziska bequeathed his
skin for a drum-head, so that though departed from among men, he might still most eloquently speak
to them, to the consternation of the oppressor. A philosophic Portuguese bondholder, ruined and
departed, has bequeathed a portion of his cuticle, (“ nearest the heart”) for the binding of Punch, in
the hope that the Right Book being rightly bound, and further being in the Right Place, might touch
the royal bosom into consideration of bondholders, not yet quite deceased.
Sir W. TEMPLE, ambassador at the Court of the Two Sicilies, has been accredited with his Punch
for the benefit of FERDINAND——unless in the opinion of Sir William, the individual is too crass, as
Punca’s revered friend, Lord Brougham would say, to apprehend one iota of the beauty and utility of
the gift. The volume is bound in convict gray, a court colour in which His Majesty delights to clothe
his noblest and wisest of subjects,
Mr. Punch forbears to notice every individual case. Let it suffice that no crowned head-no
beavered head, for the United States' President is especially. cared for—has been overlooked.
Mr. Punch had his volume prepared for ALEXANDER of Russia, and duly bound in Manchester
cotton (handsomely presented by Alexander's friend, John Bright), determined upon sending the book
to St. Petersburgh under the sanctity of a flag of truce. As, however, Russia is apt to dye a flag of
truce in the heart's blood of the bearer, Mr. Punch will not hazard an envoy. No: he will rather wait
and deliver it with his own hand to ALEXANDER himself, when that remorseful individual shall occupy the
state-prison (handsomely fitted up for his service) of Coldbath Fields.
Meanwhile, it is hoped that in hundreds of thousands of book-cases, the Right Punch will be found
in the Right Place.

NOTES FOR JANUARY.
8th, Plough Monday-of course a Holiday
for Harrow.
10th, Day breaks at 6h. 2m. Considering
that every day breaks, we should, instead
of wasting the remainder of a broken day,
make the best use we can of all the pieces.
The dew point will fall on the 4th of
the month, when Bills are generally pay-
able.
In frosty weather we are told we should
lop our timber out of doors. The most
sensible way of lopping your timber will
be to cut your stick and go in doors to a
comfortable fire.
Instead of catching cold by preparing a
hot-bed for an early lettuce, let us prepare
our own hot-bed early with a warming-pan.
As the hedge-sparrow will now sing, you
may take a note of it.
NOTES FOR FEBRUARY.
3rd, BLAISE. This feast ought to be no
feast at all, for if BLAISE were to bave a
blow-out, there would be an end of him.
Some of the Almanacks contain "a Table
of the True Dip of the Sea Horizon, cor-
rected for Refraction." We confess our
selves not deep enough for such a dip, and
we should not know how to correct it if it
proved refractory.
In this month keep calves warm by
putting them into gaiters.

T.
HOW TO PROVE A LOVER,
In order to try your Lover's affection
for you, take an opportunity of dancing
some evening continually with somebody
else, or of otherwise flirting, whilst, in the
mean time, you snub and slight him. If
this conduct does not destroy his regard
for you, he loves you indeed sincerely; but
he is a fool: and don't you have him.
MEMORABLE EPOCHS.
THERE are certain exciting epochs in a
woman's life that are never forgotton ;
such as, for instance the first time she
carries a parasol, the first time she receives
a Valentine, the first time she goes to an
evening party, the first time a proposal is
made to her, the first time she wears a
velvet dress, and the first time she puts on
the wedding-ring.
A MUSTARD-SEED FABLE.
HISTRIONIC.-KEAN had made up his face
for Macbeth. “Now, what are we to think
of ourselves?” says Indian-ink to Hare's-
foot. “Think!” says Hare's-foot,
we must think ourselves accessory to a
horrid murder."

A MUSTARD-SEED FABLE.
CONNUBIAL.-Says Mr. Pin, in a rage
to his wife, MRS. NEEDLE. "I only wish
you'd a head on your shoulders. Says
MRS. NEEDLE, in a passion, “Don't talk to
me: if
you had only an eye about you, as
I have !"
THE BATTLE OF WOMAN.-A girl of ten
displays courage amounting to rashness in
her first Engagement, but is usually de-
ficient in steadiness.
CONUNDRUM FOR THE CLERGY. – What
aperture in a man of-war reminds you of
MR. DEAN's mouth? A Port-hole.
“LETTERED INDOLENCE.”—The Police-
man (A 1) who strolls about Herne Bay.
HINT TO LITIGANTS.-A suit at law
means rags.
RECREATION IN NATURAL HISTORY.-A
young gentleman of a lively turn sent his
slow friend to an ornithologist for a Yellow
hammer to drive a nail.
LOVE AND LITERATURE. — Some say that
every Lover is a Poet: this is by no means
true: it is, however, a fact that the Lover,
considered both as a render and a writer,
is generally a man of Letters.
A REAL BLESSING TO MOTHERS. -
Couldn't somebody invent a soap which
would enable Mammas to get their
Daughters off their hands?
CONUNDRUM BY A STUPID MAN IN LODG-
INGS.—Why is my tea like my pale brandy!
Because it is stolen by my landlady.
SHABBY MAGNIFICENCE.-Much Gilding
and Carving without Knife and Fork.
THE ICE HARVEST.

HINTS TO ENGLISHMEN/VISITING
PARIS.
It will, doubtless, be your study while
you are in France to be as much as possible
mistaken for a Frenchman. You will
therefore, of course, be careful not to tako
a passport, as that would immediately
dispel the illusion.
Bear in mind that Continental Railways
make no charge for extra luggage. There-
fore, don't deprive yourself of any little
comfort you are used to. Such as a spring
mattress, or a shower bath, because they
make a few more packages in travelling.
If you happen to hold a commission in
the Popshot Fencibles, don't forget to put
your uniform into your portmanteau, as
you will be sure to find it handy for a
levée or review. You will also, of course,
take care to let your moustache grow from
the moment of your leaving Folkestono.
The French, you should remember, are a
military nation, and you cannot pleaso
them better than by assuming an in-
tensely martial aspect and demeanour as
long as you are with them.
You will, of course, be careful to leave
your card upon the EMPEROR, the morning
after your arrival. Every Euglishman is
expected to dine with him before leaving
Paris. His palace, the Hôtel de Ville, is
in the Calf Market.
When you go to see a church or other
public cdifice, do not scruple to bring off
à few souvenirs of your visit. By lagging
a little behind your party, you may easily
snip away a bit or two of tapestry, or chip
off the nose or little finger of a Statue.
The Statue, it is true, will be ruined by
your mutilation, but what's that to you?
În all probability you will never have the
chance of seeing it again.
COUSINS IN COZENAGE.-It is the opinion
of the doctor that the lawyer gets his living
by plunder, whilst the lawyer thinks that
the doctor obtains his by pillage.

dinners are few, the amount of the bill ob-
jected to, and nothing given to the waiters,
will be set down as mean time at Greenwich.

MEDIÆVAL ART.-Everybody must have
remarked that the figures of the mediæval
artists are ridiculously out of drawing. Is
this because they studied the ecclesiastical
rather than the Lay Figure ?
RUSSIA AND ROME.-Modern Russia is
As ambitious as ancient Rome; but whereas
Rome possessed conscript fathers, the con.
scripts of Russia are her children.
LONGEVITY OF WOMEN. - A married
woman ought to last longer than a single
one, because she is husbanded.
NOTE ON LORD BYRON.-A Cockney says
that the Isles of Greece are Spawn and
Whale ile, which are extracted from
Blubber.
A FRIENDLY CAUTION.-If ladies persist
in wearing bonnets that leave their hair
apparent to the Sun, they will find their
crowns soon changed into tanners.

HINTS TO ENGLISHMEN VISITING
PARIS.
You may also show your independence
by refusing to conform to other customs
than those of the Douane. Go for instance
to the Mabille in a cricketing cap, and
bonnet the door-keepers if they refuse to
admit you.
Accustomed as you are in London to
regard a cab as a vehicle of abuse, you will
hardly know at first how to deal with the
civil voituriers of Paris. You may, how-
ever, take it for granted their civility is
merely a cloak for extortion, and so take
your oaths with your seat as usual.
Let no idle fears of the Custom House
deter you from executing whatever female
commissions you have fortunately been
favoured with. The douaniers at Folkestone
and Calais are all excessively polite, and
you may pass any quantity of satin shocs
or Jouvin's "Six and a quarter," by simply
explaining they were bought for your own
wearing. Bear in mind that England
expects every man will do his duty." So
don't disgrace your country by acting
otherwise.
Should you ever wish to leave a theatre
between the acts, you can keep your place
by simply tying your handkerchief round
the seat. At the Opera, however, you must
be careful to leave it at the end of the per-
formance, as the handkerchiefs so used are
there the perquisites of the Government.
Should you ever find yourself in want
of ready money, recollect the French equi-
valent for “my uncle," is ma tante. 'l'he
British Ambassador has, however, orders
to cash all checks that are presented to
him by Englishmen between the business

ORIGINAL REMARKS BY OUR
PHILOSOPHER.
(A very great bore by the way.)
The English weather seems to affect my
accounts, for they are still very unsettled.
You may ascribe it to my credit when
I say, that there is one thing that I should
not wish "to go upon tick" for--and that
is, tic-douloureux.
When I hear of "a man of sterling
worth," I think that it is frequently the
worth of pounds sterling that is meant.
I see so many advertisements of new-
fashioned pipes and ineerschaums, that I
begin to think these must be the piping
times of peace; or else, the aspect of the
times is a mere sham.
Imprudent marriages lead to such beg-
gary, that they not only begin, but often
terminate in the Union.
I don't know what may be the letter of
the Law, but its letters are £ s. d.

THE FEMALE ROCHEFOUCAULD,
SOME young ladies are so artificial that
in love-making even, they use none but
artificial flowers of speech.
The veil was given to flirts to hide the
want of blushes.
SHAKESPEARE very wisely never wrote
the "Seven Ages of Woman," for he knew
well enough that woman has but one age
-the Age of Youth and Beauty-that, with
some, terminates as early as thirty-nine,
and with others, at forty; but with the
majority, never at all.
Considering the ugliness of the other sex,
women needn't be so proud of their own
beauty.
Let a girl be ever so young, the moment
she is married she becomes a woman.
The game of fashionable life is to play
hearts against diamonds,
The great value of arithmetic is to add
up the number of one's lovers and dresses.

HINTS TO ENGLISHMEN VISITING
PARIS.
SEIZE every opportunity of leaving traces
of your visit by carving your name, or at
least your initials, on all the tombs and
statues you can let your hands on. In
many of the churches, you will find that
chisels and tenpenny nails are kept on
purpose to facilitate this weakness of the
English. Should you be deterred at first
by any silly scruples on the score of injuring
a work of art, bear in mind that it cannot
but be gratifying to the feelings of a
Frenchman to see his national monuments
thus bear the marks of the distant pilgrim-
ages that are made to them.
Should you ever find it necessary to enter
into conversation, you will find your phrase
book will remove all impediments of speech.
The dialogues provide for every possible
emergency, and the only danger is of their
leading you into too_great freedoms of
speech. Should your French ever fail you
for a word, you will find that you may
make yoursell perfectly intelligible by
speaking it in "English with a strong
foreign accent
When you are in Paris, don't be a Pari-
sian : carry your exclusiveness always pro-
minently about with you: use the national
expletive upon the slightest provocation :
and lose no opportunity of giving lessons in
the Noble Art of Self-Defence, for you know
"la Boxe" is little studied out of England,
and may, therefore, be indulged in with
impunity.
THE TANTALUS OF THE MODERN SCHOOL.
-An idle schoolboy, instead of being
thrashed, was kept without his dinner,
and set to learn, as an imposition, several
pages of SoYER's Cookery Book.
NOTE ON SAINT CECILIA'S DAY.-This
saint, though of a sweet temper, was re-
markable for her airs.
FELICITY OF THE Vulgar TONGUE.-Un-
educated persons call the aperture which
admits the light a "winder." It is so
when it admits a draught as well.
THE HUNTSMAN AT DINNER.—The worst
rider can often get on very well with a sad-
dle of mutton.
NOTE IN THE NURSERY.— The eyes of a
baby pour rivers, when as yet there is no
bridge to the nose.
A KNOWING PLANT.—The Sage.
TOAST FOR AN AGRICULTURAL DINNER.
- May the farmers perform more opera-
tions in the Field than the Surgeons.
Wax LIGHTS AT AN Hotel.-Elsewhere
a wax candle is only stuck in a candle-
stick; but Hotel-keepers also stick it into
the Traveller.
“WHAT CAN'T BE CORED must be en-
dured," as the man said of his neighbour's
noisy pig.
CAUSE AND EFFECT.—Whenever Parlia-
ment closes its effect upon the newspapers
appears to be a succession of showers of
frogs, and enormous gooseberries.
A RARE GAME.- It's a fact, but you very
rarely see two women playing at chess
together. We suppose it is because, with
such a partner, there is but little amuse-
ment to either in being mated.

Of many bravoes : let them fear his frown:

Ah! why should brave men cut their brothers' throats
To glorify this Fiend in human shape,
Who on their mutual carnage safely gloats ?
Who, whilst they perish, safe from scratch or sorape,
Grins at their misery, like a giant ape.

However, that is a matter of small consequence—our own object is to
expose the hideous turpitude of LORD PALMERSTON by explaining the
spirit of the URQUHART Revelations.
Q. You are familiar with the history of the VISCOUNT PALMERSTON ?
A. I am.
Q. Will you do the Committee the favour of explaining the policy of
that statesman, and of pointing out its evils ?
4. Don't use such feeble language, you stupid fellow. Ask precise
questions.
Q. Is LORD PALMERSTON a statesman ?
A. No, he is an utter donkey.
Q. Is he a patriot
?
A. No, he hates England, and has sold it to Russia,
Q. Is he a man?
X. No, he is an old woman.
Q. Is he an amiable, philanthropic personage ?
A. No, he is a vengeful, malignant, merciless oppressor.
X; Does he understand Foreign Affairs ?
4. Not in the least. I do not think that he knows the White Sea
from the Black Sea.
Q. Can he speak French ?
4. Not a word. The commonest despatch has to be translated for
him by a clerk.
Q. Has he the ear of the House of Commons ?
A. Not in the least. When he rises men either leave the House-
address themselves to private conversation, or go to sleep. Whereas,
when I used to rise-but never mind that. Go on to the next question.
Q. Who burned the Houses of Parliament ?

THE EPAULET IN TURKEY.
DECIDEDLY the Turks are savages. Barbarians—uncivilised beings
-utterly unmindful of what is due to rank and station. We incline
to agree with Mr. Bright that England ought to be ashamed of taking
the part of such people.
What do we learn from the very latest correspondence from Con-
stantinople? That a "painful ceremony has taken place." That two
distinguished officers in the Turkish army, SULEIMAN Pacha and
HALET BEY, who were found to have abandoned their posts in one of
the Crimean battles, were publicly degraded. Official reprobation
was pronounced upon them in the presence of thousands of spectators,
their epaulets were roughly torn off by the private soldiers, and then,
amid the hootings of the crowd, they were sent off in chains to undergo
a seven years' penal servitude.
That is the way Turks treat cfficers and gentlemen who refuse or
neglect to do their duty in the field. How much better it would have
been for SULEIMAN and Halet had they belonged to a privileged class
in a Christian island. Then LORD SULEIMAN and the HONOURABLE
Haler, instead of having thus been made an example to Europe, might
have refused or neglected to do their duty, but instead of being pub-
licly censured by the authorities, of having epaulets torn off and
fetters clapped on, and of being sent to seven years' imprisonment,
they would have been permitted to retire from the service of their
Sovereign.
Decidedly, we repeat it, the Turks are savages, and do not know how
to deal with officers and gentlemen who have the misfortune to dis-
grace a noble army and so far as in them lies, to peril a noble cause.

are that people as well as the Hindoos, and therefore is it that we are
getting on so slow in the East. We are that blockheaded people,
I mean that people headed by blocks. Why have we a Commissariat
Officer and a Commander-in-Chief, with functions so distinct, that
25,000 men are half-starved, because the former cannot procure from
the latter the loan of a corporal's guard? Why should tents and
clothing be rotting on the shores of Balaclava and Varna for several
weeks for the simple reason that the head of the Ordnance depart-
ment, for want of a proper understanding with the heads of other
departments, bas preoccupied all the transports? Why, but for the
circumstance that we are a people whose rulers are logs : and their
subordinates also logs, and at logger-heads ? The Hindoos, indeed,
are less the fools of Caste than ourselves : for though one will not do
another's work, yet a Brahminical butler does not, I believe, object
to make arrangements with his co-religionist, the lackey: nor do the
groom and stable-boy of that persuasion refuse to put their horses

JUDICIAL CLAP TRAPS.
A PRACTICE has been springing up lately among certain
judicial authorities of making clap-trap speeches to Grand
Jurymen upon political and other irrelevant topics. We
find a report of one of these orations the other day inter-
larded with ("Hear!" from one of the Grand Jury) by
way of parenthesis. Of course the poor fellow's enthu.
siasm was instantly checked, and indeed smashed as “in-
decent,” though the Judge himself had been the party who
had roused the feelings of the excited Juryman. Had the
facts been literally reported, we should probably have
seen the words_("Hear!” from one of the Grand Jury)
followed by (“ Bravo!” from the audience), (“Silence
from the usher), (“ Order, Order !” from a wag in the body i
of the Court)," ("* Turn him out!” from the tipstaff), and
“ Sensation" on the part of everybody.) In such a scene
of confusion, the real source of the mischief, which hap-
pens to be the little bit of bombast or clap-trap from the
Bench is too often lost sight of, and frequently the Judge
himself is foremost in exclaiming, “this is indelicate,"
though he has been the original offender. For our own
parts, we prefer the old fashioned address of a learned
Assistant Judge, who sometimes disposes of the Grand
Jury in the following laconic fashion :-
"Gentlemen of the Grand Jury-You are a very ancient
body, but you are utterly useless, and I am happy to hear

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
to believe can have been written by one of those aristocrats who, the
other day, stood round their QUEEN, and listened to the spirited tones
in which she alluded to the enemy of the country. While the
Sovereign is summoning the true hearts of England to aid her in
crushing the Imperial Miscreant, LORD CLANRICARDE, one of her
peers, is represented as full of " lively gratitude" and "profound
emotion” that the miscreant in question should deign to "recollect
him," and is made to say that he can never forget the Cossack's
personal goodness.” And he is actually shown as apologising for
being obliged to have a son in the QUEEN's army, a son who is un-
happily compelled to bear arms against Nicholas. The clumsiness of
the libel is no excuse for its malevolence.
It was not to be expected that the Journal of St. Petersburg would
do things by halves, or that those who had slandered the father would
not equally libel the son. The gallant young officer is also made to
write his letter of fulsome and abject thanks, and to say :-
“Kaluga, November 10, 1854.
"Me. GOVERNOR, I hope I need not, in the first place, assure your Excellency I feel
moved by the act of kindness the Emperor has been graciously pleased to exhibit
towards me. This magnanimity, which restores me to complete freedom, and uncon-
ditionally, is really the act of a great man, and although I shall never be in a situation
to express to him my whole gratitude with words, I nevertheless pray you to have the
kindness to inform the Minister of War how deeply I am moved by the noble and
magnanimous conduct of his Majesty the Emperor. My heart will never forget it."
Imagine a spirited young officer concocting such an epistle, and
finding in his own release the “act of a Great Man," and one which
his heart will never forget. The Journal of St. Petersburg, has been
so long in the habit of lying that its touch is coarsened, and it violates
probabilities. We are glad to have the means of declaring our own

A MOST DESIRABLE END.
It is the popular architectural
fashion, when any great building is
taken in band, to call in PRINCE
ALBERT to lay the first stone.
Now, judging from the very long
time that most of our public build-
ings take before they arrive at ma-
turity, we think there is some-
thing wrong at the bottom of this
custom, and that our charitable
founders begin foolishly at the
wrong end. Would it not be de-
sirable to secure the services of
our beloved Prince to lay, not the
first, but the last stone because
the latter ceremonial, if well-adver-
tised beforehand, might have a
beneficial effect in hurrying on the
works, and the chances are, that
they would be finished within a
reasonable time. As it is, any one
anxious to wish PRINCE ALBERT a
long life, could not express it more
neatly than by saying :-" May

A TASTE OF ELLIOTT'S ENTIRE.
At a meeting of the Law Amendment Society the other
day, a MR. ELLIOTT (not the worthy Magistrate we hope)
insisted on the necessity for “going back to the ancient
pious! healthy !! and Christian !!! principle of yenge-
ance. The principle is certainly an ancient, and may
possibly be a pious one-according to some of the piety
of the present day—but to call it either healthy or Christian
is to show an ignorance or a misapprehension of the rules
applicable to health, and of the doctrine of Christianity.
Happily in these days it is not necessary to argue the
point with MR. ELLIOTT, who will find few sympathisers with
his avowedly retrogressive sentiments. If we are to punish
a criminal on the principle of vengeance, we should strip
every garment from the back of him who robbed us of our
coat, and we should repay with interest a blow on the
cheek, a mode of proceeding which would be obviously
at variance with a well known precept of Christianity.
We hope that the Law Amendment Society will not think
of trying to amend the law by importing into it the prin-
ciple of revenge, which it has been the humane policy of
modern legislation to ignore as much as possible.

In the Commons, LORD JOHN RUSSELL, getting several rows behind
his colleagues, for fear of accidents from the Peelites (who are able-
bodied men), made his explanation. It was to the same effect as his
letter, but he added details. It had suddenly “struck” him, while he
was shaving one morning in October, that a better administration of
the war was required. So he wrote to ABERDEEN, telling him, that
PALMERSTON ought to be made the head of the whole war department.
He explained to ABERDEEN that NEWCASTLE was a muff, but that as
it would be uncivil to say so, he might be turned out on pretext of a
change of official arrangements. ABERDEEN had admitted the muff-
ship, and that had they to choose anew, NEWCASTLE would not be
made War Minister, but urged that it would annoy him so much to turn
him out now, that common politeness required that the war should
continue to be mismanaged, and the army ruined. LORD JOHN allowed
that there was much in this, and after consulting his "intimate
friends," who are all highly políte men, they agreed that he must “not
press the matter further.” Last Saturday the Cabinet determined to
do something to improve the system of war administration, but it was
so incomplete and ineffectual a measure (the proposal was that an
extra boy should be laid on to carry the DUKE's notes to SIDNEY
HERBERT, so that the regular porter might be promoted to the putting
coals on the office fires), that LORD John felt it would not do." So he
determined to resign. He then said that ABERDEEN was a very
respectable man, that Austria was our earnest friend, so was France,
as he had ascertained on his late visit (having inquired of several
garçons, a soubrette, and a limonadier on the subject, who had all said

fallen off from our illustrious and illustrated forefathers; men, who in
their very rudeness, somewbat obeyed the instincts of a high nature
by painting their own imaginary orders on their own bodies.
And then great events have suddenly made us aware, and we hope
asbamed,
of our state of nakedness. We have embraced the French
people: British millions have taken Gallic millions to their arms, and
the first dozen or two fraternal hugs given and received, JOHN CRAPAUD
has looked with an eye of wonder-a look in a moment sweetly
tempered by his characteristic delicacy--at the utter indecency of JOHN
BULL. Why, he is all but stark naked; for he has not a bit of ribạnd

John from stark staring nakedness!
The face of BULL, on the other side, reflecting the geranium riband
in the button-bole of CRAPAUD, BULL is ready to believe his new friend
the very pink of chivalry, and the very best dressed gentleman.
BULL never looked at geranium ribands before; or, if indeed, he saw
them, it was with an uncontrollable curl of his national nose; with an
ill-mannered grunt, which he can no longer utter—it has been pressed
for good and all out of him-since he embraced his dear friend. It is,
however, plain to Bull that a bit of riband may have "magic in the
web of it :” that with only a few filaments of silk, a man, otherwise
naked, may be wrapped up in measureless content.
Whereupon, JOHN BULL inclines his ears-and at full length, too-
to the crowd that cries—“Bull, be decent and clothe yourself with an
Order. Hit upon something that shall cover your social nudity. Be
one of a multitude most multitudinous rather than of nothing notable,

ETIQUETTE FOR MOURNERS.
We have had books of Etiquette for Ladies
and Gentlemen who have felt that they did
not know how to behave themselves, but
there is a novelty in attempting to regulate
the mode of being miserable by a Book of
Etiquette for Mourners, which bas lately
been published by one of the Mourning
Establishments. The proprietors of these
concerns are at liberty to trade on private
grief, and to keep up a staff of melancholy
looking young men and women to serve
afflicted customers, but it is carrying trickery
of trade a little too far to publish a book of
Etiquette for Mourners.
The first chapter is devoted to the Widow,
the depth of whose sorrow is to be marked
by the depth of her crape, while a cousin is
allowed to show her mitigated sorrow in
barège with flounces, and an option of grey
or black in her gloves, parasol, and bonnet.
There is a short chapter on Compli-
mentary Mourning," which requires the
solemnity of at least a gray dress, but allows
the spirits to revive in the parasol, which
may
be of "Fancy" colours. The grief
which exists in the dress, but perishes in
the parasol, can scarcely be said to merit
the epithet of “complimentary,” and indeed
any, grief that requires a Book of Etiquette
for its direction, might as well be altogether
dispensed with.

ULTRA-CAPITAL PUNISHMENT!
HITHERTO the severest penalty known to the law of
England, since the abolition of drawing_and quartering,
has been death by simple suspension. It now, however,
seems probable that assassination will be visited with a
severer punishment, and that too, without constitutional
trial. The verdict of a Coroner's Jury will, at least in
the County of Middlesex, be followed by instant execution.
As soon as it has been delivered, the Inspector of Police
in attendance will collar the prisoner.
The Foreman of
the Jury, acting under the Coroner's orders, will collar
him on the other side. They will then pull for the posses-
sion of his body, and by so doing will tear his clothes from
his back. The culprit, thus stripped, will again be seized
by his two executioners, one of them grasping his right
arm, and the other his left. The Inspector, with the aid
of his subordinate constables, and the Foreman assisted by
his brother jurors, will then tug at the unfortunate man's
arms until they have torn them off; after which, taking
him by the leg on either side, they will pull away his lower
extremities in the same manner. If the poor wretch is not
dead by this time, the belligerents will scramble for his
trunk, and the stronger party will take it and bear it away,
to breathe the miserable remainder of its life out at the
gaol or the station-house, as victory shall determine.
Between MR. WAKLEY and INSPECTOR DARGAN,' with
their respective partisans, it appears that an execution,
similar to the above, was very nearly taking place one
day last week in front of the Middlesex Hospital. We
rejoice that the scene of horror was not consummated, for
the dreadful spectacle would have disgraced our civilisa-
tion, and perhaps have inflicted a fatal shock on the nerves
of some of the hospital patients who may have been looking
out of window. The sternest advocates for the retention
of Capital Punishment will deprecate the repetition, in the
nineteenth century, in the case of even the worst criminal,
of the atrocities which were inflicted on RAVAILLAC and
DAMIENS.

AMID the clouds of grief and wrath,
That o'er the heart of England brood,
One bright star holds its blessed path,
Unswerving, unsubdued.
A steady radiance : breathing balm
To throbbing limb, and wand'ring brain ;
Investing death with hallowed calm,
Taking the sting from pain.
Through miles of pallets, thickly laid
With sickness in its foulest guise,
And pain, in forms to have dismayed,
Man's science-hardened eyes.
A woman, fragile, pale, and tall,
Upon her saintly work doth move.
Fair or not fair, who knows? But all
Follow her face with love.

Speaks of full songs through darkness heard,
And fancy findeth likeness meet
Between thee and the bird,
Whose music cheers the glooming wold,
As thy low voice the anguish dim,
That through these sad rooms lieth cold
On brain and heart and limb.

must be congratu-

which has been made
in the advertisement of
MADAME TUSSAUD's
Exhibition. What was
formerly described as
the “Chamber of Hor-
rors,” is now termed
the “ Chamber of

is a recognition of an
improvement in the
popular taste, to which
the horrible no longer
affords any attraction,
and which, instead of
that, demands the seientific. People now go to the Baker Street Waxworks,
not to gape with morbid interest at CourvoISIER and DANIEL GOOD, but for the
purpose of studying the lineaments of those villains, with a view to proper precau-
tion against gentlemen of similar aspect. This being the case, we hope and trust

WHAT master hand shall set on the right path
These our blind guides, that wander to and fro ?
What pen shall write the nation's helpless wrath ?
What cry shall speak its woe?
That noble army, that so stirred our pride
So stout, so well-equipped, so trim arrayed--
Melts like a snow-wreath from a warm hill-side,
And we can give no aid !
That starving army haunts us night and day;
Clouding our gladness, deepening our care ;
By our warm hearths—"Alas, no fire have they!”
Snow falls—“'tis falling there !"
We strive to chase the phantom : still it bides ;
Stretches gaunt hands between us and our meat ;
In our warm beds, lies freezing at our sides :
Trips up our dancing feet.
Why hauntest thou us, grim spectre ? 'Twas not we
Who brought thee to this miserable end.
As flowed thy blood for us, our gold for thee
We, without stint, did spend.
“All art we had, all industry, all skill,
To feed and clothe, and lodge thee, was bestowed.”
Thus from the blue lips, agonised and shrill,
The spectre's answer flowed :
"My blood is on your heads! My blood, not spilt
As soldiers' blood should be, upon the field.
Oh! that I had but fallen, hilt to bilt,
Like Spartan on his shield !
“A soldier, I had met the soldier's death,
Nor grudged the life so for my country given.
But thus, like beasts, not men, to yield man's breath,

“Rotting in our own filth, like mangy hounds,
Cramped, frost and hunger bitten to the bones,
Wrestling with death ʼmid smells, and sights, and sounds
That turn kind hearts to stones.
"To die for very lack of clothes and food,
Of shelter, bedding, medicine, and fire
While six miles off lay, piled up many a rood,
All we did so require !
“This guilt lies at your door. You wear no crown-
But what is She who wears it unto you?
You raise up ministers and pluck them down ;
What you will, they must do.
“If they put leadership in baby hands,
'Tis that you wink, or slumber, or approve;
If, like an iron wall, Routine still stands;
You will, and it must move?
“If Aristocracy's cold shadow fall
Across the soldier's path, to you is given
The might to rend away that ancient pall,
And let in light of Heaven !

If I, not he, be baffled, rest the shame

UN-MINISTERIAL MOVEMENTS.
NOTHING can exceed the stupid monotony of the announcements which during
the great crisis of the country's affairs were daily and bourly appearing in the
London newspapers. The following is a specimen of the sort of thing to which the
public had to look for amusement or information, when every moment was of
importance to the fate of the Empire.
LORD NOODLE called this morning on the EARL OF DOODLE, after which he
proceeded to the house of VISCOUNT COODLE, where he was joined by the MARQUIS
OF FOODLE.
In the course of the afternoon the attendance of the EARL OF DOODLE was com-
manded at Buckingham Palace. Immediately on quitting HER MAJESTY the Earl
OF DOODLE proceeded to the residence of the HONOURABLE SPOONEY MOONEY,

LORD John FUSSELL was called upon by nobody in the course of the day, and
in the afternoon went out to call on somebody, who was not at home to the noble
Lord, who returned home to dinner.
Later in the day the HONOURABLE NIMINY PIMINY received a communication
from VISCOUNT COODLE, with which he hastened to the residence of the DUKE
OF NAMBY, whom he found in consultation with the MARQUIS OF PAMBY.
Still later in the afternoon the Queen, having granted a second interview to
the EARL OF DOODLE sent for LORD NOODLE, who proceeded at once from the
Palace, after a few minutes consultation with HER MAJESTY, to the residence of
the MARQUIS OF FOODLE.
SIR JAMES TODDLES was visited in the course of the day by the EARL OF
NODDLES, who was immediately afterwards joined by the HONOURABLE ARTHUR
FADDLES, when they all proceeded to the house of the MARQUIS OF DADDLES,
where they remained some time in consultation.
In the evening the HONOURABLE NIMINY PIMINY had another interview with the
DUKE OF NAMBY, which lasted only a few minutes.

Like most creatures of low organization, the Red-Tapeworm admits

animal solicitude for the satisfaction of hunger and thirst. Although
the preservation of the frame which it inhabits, and whence it derives
its nourishment, is essential to its own, it never betrays any uneasiness
on that account, and it is as lively as it can be when that frame is so

NOBLE ANIMAL FOOD.
M. GEOFFROY SAINT-HILAIRE, Professor at
the Museum of Natural History at Paris, has,
we see, just delivered two lectures recommend
ing the use of horseflesh for food. The ancient
Germans and Scandinavians, the nomadic tribes
of Northern Asia, and the modern Danes, were
adduced by the Professor as examples of thriving
horse-eaters. To these perhaps he might have
added London Medical Students, and other
young men who sometimes regale themselves at
eating-houses on what they imagine to be hashed
venison. Besides the ancient Teutonic race,
he might also have cited the Small Germans of
the present time, as affording, together with
saveloys and other sausages, an illustration of
the consumption of horseflesh, though hardly,
perhaps, of its wholesomeness. It may be
remarked that the staple meat of England has
hitherto been beef, but that if M. SAINT-
HILAIRE's views should be adopted in this
country, the staple will become stable. A fat
Horse Show will probably also be established
at the Horse Bazaar. Races will be entered
for the plate after a new fashion, and the Derby
and other stakes will acquire a new significence

when we cannot get that or any other butcher's
meat, we may then be tempted to seek another
form of animal food in steed.

LORD JOHN'S TRAVELLING
EXPENSES.
COLONEL SIBTHORP has expressed a hope
that as the country will have to pay LORD JOHN
Russell's travelling expenses to Vienna, the
expenses in question "will not be heavy."
While we concur in the gallant Colonel's hope,
we trust that LORD JOHN will not feel himself
bound to do the thing sbabbily; to cut down
the waiters at the hotels; to squabble about the
price of his room, and to go to a second or
third-rate restaurant for his dinner. We should
be sorry to hear that bis Lordship had been seen
carrying his carpet-bag from the rail to the
hotel, or walking down to the boat to save the
cost of the 'bus, rather than add to the demand
he will have to make on the public purse for the
expenses of his journey.
We must appeal to COLONEL SIBTHORP's
regard for the national character, and entreat
him not to ask questions which will give
foreigners the idea of our national stinginess.
We hope we shall not find the Notice paper
crowded with such questions as “Whether
LORD JOHN RUSSELL was instructed to procure
a through ticket to Paris ?” or,“ Whether any
hints were given to the Noble Lord as to the
charge for wax-lights at the hotels on the

LORD RAGLAN'S WEATHER ALMANACKS.
THE Despatches from the Seat of War remind us rather
forcibly—though forcibly is a strong word for that which is
the very essence of feebleness-of the productions which
occasionally appear in the Times under the head of the
Weather. We have now before us a Despatch dated
February 6, which opens tbus :-
“ MY LORD DUKR,-I mentioned to your Grace on Saturday that the
weather had broken."
was
If he had mentioned it on Saturday, what necessity was
there to mention it again ; but the truth is, the COMMANDER-
IN-CHIEF appears to have nothing else to talk about. Having
once got on to his favourite, indeed his only topic, the
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF proceeds to add that “the frost was
very severe on that night :” and he then goes on to indi.
cate the condition of his thermometer, which he says
down at 13°;" and he concludes the paragraph by inti-
mating that “the wind was very high and piercingly cold."
If his Lordship ultimately pursues the enemy as vigorously
as he pursues the topic of the weather, he will be sure to
follow up any advantage that may present itself. He goes
on thus graphically-
“ Sunday was rather milder, and yesterday was finer. To-day the
glass has fallen and there is every appearance of rain."
These particulars must greatly interest the public, who
are looking with intense anxiety to every scrap of infor-
mation that arrives from the Crimea. In_ selecting the
weather as the subject of his Despatches, LORD RAGLAN
probably feels that he is adapting his style to the taste of
his countrymen, who are always talking about the weather
when they have nothing else to talk about.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.-PRUSSIA.
Not yet three years have past, since England bore
Her greatest captain to his last long home,
Under the shadowy cathedral-dome,
Where NELSON slept before.
With wail of martial brass, and muffled drum,
And warrior-mourners, went the warrior dead,
While the great city bowed a reverent head,
And peopled streets were dumb.
Another ancient soldier's course is run,
Whose warfare, if on less conspicuous fields,
Not less an honourable record yields,
Of victories hard won.
One who from boy-bood upwards waged a fight:
At first, with poverty and low estate;
Winning each step at sword-point against fate;
Scaling height after height,
To fortune's platform-where most sit them down,
As if who conquer that, have conquered all;
And may thenceforth to rest or pastime fall,

A WAR CONJUROR.
A most extraordinary event took place—an event quite,
or almost, supernatural- in LORD GODERICU's debate on
I army promotions. MR. FREDERICK PEEL, Secretary-at-
War—as a child he cut his teeth on a musket cartridge
and took his porridge out of a bomb-shell, so he ought to
know something of war-MR. PEEL rose to reply; going
as doggedly and as resolutely at LORD GODERICH, as though
he was walking up to a cannon. For a time, MR. PEEL
was listened to and looked at with great attention ; but in
two or three minutes a strange phenomenon awakened the
curiosity and deepened the interest of the House.
Our readers must, in their time, have seen a country
conjuror who, at a given moment, will proceed to pull
yards, and yards, and many many yards of riband from
his mouth, as though his stomach held nothing but a large
reel which gave the riband off at the will of the wizard.
The like phenomenon occurred in the case of MR. FREDE-
KICK PEEL; only instead of riband, he did nothing but pull
from the internal man yards and yards of red tape. It was
calculated by the Member for Lambeth that, at the close of
Mr. Peel's speech, he had uttered length of tape enough
to reach from where he stood to Downing Street, taking the
whole circuit of the offices and back again to the speaker.
Could the red tape have been convertible into red serge,
it was the opinion of a distinguished clothing-colonel in
the House, that the Secretary-at-War bad talked enough
to put coats upon the backs of a whole regiment.

PZU
Divorce by Purchase.
IMMEDIATELY following the debate on Army Promotion
by hard cash, MR. BOWYER moved for leave to bring in a
bill to abolish Crim. Con. Damages, and to make the
offence of conjugal falsehood a misdemeanour. The com-
mercial spirit of the country animating hon. members,
scouted the idea ; and, as a certain canine creature with-
draws his tail, so was poor MR. BOWYER compelled to
withdraw his motion. Thus, the law remaips double to
the rich and the poor. The poor, under no circumstance of
infidelity, are to be promoted to single blessedness; whereas
the rich may continue to obtain the freedom of divorce by
purchase.

PHILOSOPHY IN ERMINE.
The Carlisle Patriot reports of BARON PARKE that his lord-
ship, with a serenity almost exclusive to the judgment seat,
laid down a golden rule for all jurymen, which, if followed,
would always assure them under any mistake the sweetest
tranquillity of mind. They might by their verdict hang an in-
nocent man; but-“if they seriously considered all the evi-
dence on the one side, and arguments on the other, and were
still convinced that the prisoner was guilty, they could honestly
Jay their hands upon their hearts, and not feel a single pang,
even şupposing another person were hereafter to turn out to
be the murderer.” This marvellous doctrine to insure unbroken
rest between the sheets, even though the juryman had to the
best of his judgment sent an innocent man to the grave, was
laid down by the serene BARON PARKE at the late trial of the
youth MONROE, aged 18, for the murder near Whitehaven in
November last. MONROE was recommended to mercy by the
jury—the evidence was loose and circumstantial-but no mercy
was promised by the Judge. Well, presuming for' argument,
that the youth is innocent, and that nevertheless he is hanged
upon the finding of the jury? Is it possible that no juryman
can feel a pang for the sacrifice of a guiltless fellow creature
on the very threshold of manhood ? BARON PARKE must
have a very stony notion of the necessary qualities of
the human conscience. A man to lay his hand upon his
heart, and to feel no pang that-on the infirmity of human
evidence-he has doomed the innocent, must hardly have
human flesh; we should rather say a heart of the nether
millstone torpidly reposing, under the cuticle of a rhino-
ceros. Majesty has, officially, its conscience-keeper ;
should be sorry if all juries allowed every Judge to be
their conscience-maker.

and plastering it with bits of pictures taken from old scrap-books, or

A great night for the Commons of England. THE CHANCELLOR OF
TROOPS FED BY FANCY,
THE EXCHEQUER brought forward his new plan for arranging the
Newspaper Stamp question. In the course of his speech the Right
Honourable Gentleman, rising with an enthusiasm worthy of the
occasion, announced to a breathless audience that he had taken counsel
of “a personage well known to every member of the house, he meant
Mr. Punch." The House sprang to its feet, and a burst of plaudits
followed, which might have been heard at Temple Bar. PALMERSTON,
unable to control his emotion, threw himself upon JAMES WILSON,
smashing his hat, and sobbing loudly. DISRAELI's agitation prevented
his doing more than waving his band convulsively, and occasionally
giving PAKINGTON a backhander, not for the first time. SIBTHORP
danced about the house in an honourable and gallant ecstasy, and the
Brigade broke forth into shrieks of delight, frantically adjuring all
creation to come and tread upon the tail of their coats. ROEBUCK
smiled almost graciously, GRAHAM put his hat before his face, and
BRIGHT fainted away. The strangers clapped their hands, the officials
forgot to take them into custody, and even the stern Reporters were
moved to remark, “Humph—some sense in that.”
When the sensation had cooled down, the CHANCELLOR, addressing
the still agitated House, repeated that he had sought an interview
with Jr. Punch, "not with the view of inquiring how he managed
his interesting periodical”--that was not a question even for a
CHANCELLOR to ask, but "to ascertain Mr. Punch's ideas as to the

THE RETURN OF THE COURIER.
ABOUT the end of last year we were startled
by an Advertisement of a certain Resilient Bod-
dice, quoting an opinion in its favour from the
Courier newspaper. As the only newspaper of that
name with which we were acquainted was that
Courier in the Strand, which had long ago de-
parted this life, and been buried in the bowels of
the Globe, we expressed some curiosity as to the
restless shade of an Editor of what we supposed
was the defunct journal we were once ac-
quainted with. To our astonishment we bave
lately learned the fact, that there is still a
Courier newspaper, which is also a Church
Reform Gazette, and Theocratic Review, or at
least at the date of our comments such a paper
was, and may be still, in existence.
It says something for the state of the Reli-
gious World, that the Editor of a Religions
Periodical can so far unbend his mind as to offer
critical opinions on “Resilient Boddices.” The
subject seems to be a good way off from Theo-
logical Controversy, but as we have sometimes

of the discipline and education of the children in London.

How would a London Alderman like to march down

temporaneous civic dinner, instead of the banquet which
is now customary at Guildhall. If the dress serves to
cenote that the wearer is a recipient of charity, a simple
badge would answer the purpose just as well. Suppose it

WS
NOTION FOR A NEW TAX.
THERE is too much reason to fear that the
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER is at this
moment considering what new tax he shall pro-
pose on bringing forward his Budget after Easter.
We are happy to have it in our power to offer
him a suggestion for making things pleasant in
that respect-as far as it is possible to make
such things so.
The New Tax which we recommend is a Tax
on Livery. Already there is a Tax upon
Servants; but this Tax includes Waiters, who
are generally dressed like Clergymen, only a
great deal better than the majority of Curates.
It is the man, merely, that is taxed; the absur-
dities superinduced upon him are all free, except
powder. Now, we say, put a duty on the plush
also, and the shoulder-knot, and the cockade :
let every master or mistress be assessed for that
domestic whose hat, coat, or waistcoat is deco-
rated with lace, or who wears red, blue, yellow,
or green breeches. Let the tax be called the
Livery and Plush Tax.
Here is a tax which would fall on those who
can well afford it: a tax, not on a necessary, nor
even a luxury, but on a mere folly and absurdity,
which it would not abolish, but if it did, would
do an exceedingly good thing.

A SKETCH,
Promotion by Purchase.
HITHERTO, only sucb men as were born with
silver spoons in their mouths could command this
promotion; but for the future, let us hope that
the silver test will be done away with, and none
will be admitted into the QUEEN'S Service but
those who display their Britannia Metal.

TAKING PLACES IN PARLIAMENT.
MEMBERS of Parliament are naturally anxious
to get into snug places, and we are therefore
not surprised at a conversation that occurred
in the House of Commons the other night on
the subject of securing places, which it seems
is found to be rather difficult. A Member may,
it appears, get a good place if he will subject
himself to a sort of religious test by attending
prayers; but a complaint has been made that
this display of external piety will not secure a
snug place for the whole of the evening. Per.
haps it would be advisable to adopt the same
system as is pursued at some of the theatres,
where the payment of a small fee will be the
means of retaining a place to the end of the
performances.
The House of Commons might easily engage
a few place-keepers, who might call out the name

might be convenient if the Members would
come to an understanding that if a handkerchief
or glove is left on a seat, no one else should
attempt to occupy it, or perhaps if members
would leave copies of their own speeches in the
places they have left, there would be a still
greater probability that everybody would get as
far away from the place as possible.

BALLAD OF THE BOAR,
CRIMINAL LAW REFORM WANTED.
(From our Sackville Street Correspondent.)
Common law has, by an "alarming sacrifice" of the lawyers, been
reduced in price, and even Chancery has been subjected to some
reforms, which provide that “all these suits must be cleared off”
within something like a reasonable period; but Criminal law appears
from the following letter to be greatly in want of amendment.
"SIR-On the 24th inst. I committed a woman for trial at the approaching Quarter
Sessions at Chelmsford for robbing her master of one pennyworth of milk. The
expenses incurred at Petty Sessions amount in this case to ibs.; and the probable
expense of the trial at Quarter Sessions will be £4 or £5. I give publicity to this case

pennyworth of milk, one ha porth of which must be chalk, a whole
county is to be taxed to the tune of several pounds, for the purpose of
bringing the thief to punishment. In addition to the sums mentioned

​THE AMATEUR OLYMPIANS,
THE OLD MEN'S MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT
SOCIETY.
By the success which has attended the establishment of associations
of young men for the cultivation of each other's minds, some patriotic
individuals have been induced to attempt the formation of an Old Men's
Society, with a similar object. The experiment of mutual education has
been tried upon the youth of the middling classes, but it will be repeated
among elderly men in the higher ranks. To restore the Latin and
Greek which old gentlemen have forgotten will naturally be imagined
to be the design of the contemplated institution; but it is intended
rather to teach them what they have never learned. The application
of common knowledge and common sense to the conduct of civil and
military affairs, is the end of which the Old Men's Mutual Improvement
Society is destined to the promotion.
It has lately been customary to consider our aged officials as univer,
sally ignorant of all practical business. The case is not quite so bad
as this. Great and lamentable as their destitution may generally be of
the knowledge of almost everything they ought to know, each individual
among them, for the most part, possesses some little information of a
serviceable nature, which he can impart to his fellow, receiving instruc-
tion on some other subject in return. This interchange of ideas
between the various Boards—the Ordnance and the Horse Guards, the
Victualling Office and the Admiralty, and the Medical Department and
that of the Transport Service-cannot but be attended with a certain
beneficial result.

THE UNACKNOWLEDGED CAPTAINS.
“Once a Captain always a Captain," is a saying com-
monly received. A man may, however, have been a
Captain not only for a limited period, but for any term;
not only a Captain but a General ; may have performed the
most signal services, and gained the most glorious victories
in the Indian army, and yet, on arriving in this country,
become no officer at all. To be once a Captain, therefore,
somewhere in the British empire is not to be always a Cap-
tain everywhere in the same. Can these statements,
asks the foreign reader, be true? Are they not some of
Mr. Punch’s nonsense? Is it possible that such an in-
famous and absurd regulation as that which he alludes to is
maintained in regard to the British army? Not only can
Mr. Punch assure his exotic friend that these things are
so, but also that our Indian officers about to be employed
in the Crimea, to supply the incapacity of those at present
in command there, are to have merely local rank in that
sphere of service : besides which they are to be rewarded
with much less pay than that whereof they have been in the
receipt.
It is further a fact that these terms have been accepted
by several Indian officers, who must either be the greatest
of patriots, or the greatest of fools-and the latter are
not wanting in the Crimea. To allow these officers to
retain their previous pay may be impracticable, but what
can deny them the advantage of mere rank in the Army but
a stinginess which is simply idiotic ? Rank costs nothing.

wrong-this parsimony which saves no expense—this gra-

BEAUCHAMP and BERKELEY, MONTACUTE, DE Mauley, and De

STAFFORD and SPENCER, D'ERESBY, and CHANDOS—names of pride,
Hailed by the crowd with loud acclaim, as armed at point they ride!
But who is this, that cheering turps to blessing on each tongue,
That every cap is sudden dofted-each hand in greeting flung ?
Are they for him, that humbly rides on a low and sorry hack,
Armed, save the bare and gracious head, in armour plain and black,
Are they for him, these blessings, this greeting far and wide,
Or rather for the stately form that rideth at his side,
Right royally apparelled, on a destrier white as milk,
Half hid neath blazoned housings of sendal and of silk ?
That mean knight is the good BLACK PRINCE-the flower of chivalrie-
And by his side, the French King, John, brought captive over sea-
He is the first French reigning King, that e'er trod London ground-,
And thus he treads it-English throats, shout !- English steeples, sound!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
A DISBANDED BAND.
SOME of the papers speak of a quarrel between the
Band-master and a portion of the Band of the Crystal
Palace. We regret that there should be any discord where
all ought to be harmony; and, witbout saying which is
right, or which may be in the wrong, we can only hope
that the Band will settle their quarrel without rushing
into print ; for, when an ophicleide publishes a note, or
a trombone explains itself at some length, there is sure
to be a large amount of longwindedness. Without hearing
both sides, we can scarcely believe an assertion we saw in
print, that the clarionet had been “ordered into the cus-
iody of two policemen, for improving a cadenza by a few
notes of bis own." It is, undoubtedly, an offence to utter
forged notes; but we do not think any police inspector
would take such a charge against a clarionet; nor, indeed,
do we see how the notes could be traced, so as to be pro-
duced for the purpose of proving the forgery. If the
improvement of a cadenza were such an act as would justify
the arrest of the party making the improvement, there is
scarcely a cadenza that would not have rendered GRISI
liable to be taken, literally in execution; for, nihil tetigit
quod non ornarit, may be said of her whole career as a
vocalist.
We might, perhaps, pardon the infringement on the
liberty of the subject, if a policeman were at hand to
arrest every singer who should utter a false note; but, if
this rule were to be adopted, a policemam would be
obliged every now and then to clear the stage, for we have
heard an entire chorus singing out of tune at once, at some
operatic performances. We except, of course, the Royal
Italian Opera, Covent Garden, which has given an instance
of how nearly perfection in every department may be
acquired.

POTICHOMANIA.
It may be agreeable to such of our readers
as make a point of following the latest fashion
in religion, to be informed that a certain num-
ber of exstatic ladies round Belgravia, have
formed themselves into a committee for the pur-
pose of potichomaniaing a large cathedral window,
which they intend presenting to the reverend
incumbent of St. Paul's, Knightsbridge. The
subject is not yet decided upon; but it is not
unreasonably, supposed that some incident of
persecution in the life of MR. LIDDELL, or MR.
BENNETT, or, perhaps even, of poor MR. FITZROY,
who is now in prison bleeding for the sainted
cause, will be selected for the purpose of mock
illumination.
This new process of Potichomaniaing is
singularly well adpted to the extremely “dim
and “religious” light of Puseyism : for it bears
the same relation to the rich stained-glass window,
and the plain undecorated ditto, that Puseyism
itself does to Catholicism and Protestantism.
It occupies just the same mid-way position be-
tween the two--being neither highly-decorated,
nor beautifully simple, but superlatively artificial
--artificiality carried up to the highest degree of
trumpery finish! It is neither nature nor art,
but a glaring attempt to combine the two. We
shall take a peculiar pleasure in noticing this new
effort of sanctified Potichomania as it gradually
advances towards completion.

A GOVERNMENT OF TAILORS.
We met the other day with the remark that "but for
the social restrictions we put upon them, many of our
present Ministers would be thriving tailors.” It is certainly
our own fault that we will not allow our aristocracy to
make themselves useful, and that if a Lord were to start
a shop, or practice some handicraft, he would be sure to be
loaded with ridicule. We confess we would rather see
the names of some of our present Ministers over the shop
doors in Regent Street, than over the official doors in
Downing Street. WOOD, Dealer in Marine Stores," seems
to us more natural than “WOOD, First Lord of the
Admiralty,", and we should prefer hearing that “GREY
& Co” had “no connexion with any other shop" than
that they were attempting to manage the two very
extensive concerns known as the Colonial Office and the
Home Department. “RUSSELL, dealer in Pickles, from
Vienna,” would be more satisfactory to us than that the
pickles should all be in Downing Street, and that RusSELL
who is supposed to have charge of them should be away
on some other business.
We do not, bowever, quite agree with our contempo-
rary in thinking that our Ministers would have made
good tailors, for nothing can be less satisfactory than
their measures, and the art of cutting a coat according to
the cloth does not seem to be understood in Downing
Street. Our Ministers instead of making good tailors
would be well adapted for the Holyweil Street trade, as
they seem to understand nothing but old habits.

A Vain Enquiry.
We laugh at persons who are vain, but the question is
if we, ourselves, are not just as vain as the person we are
laughing at? Find us, if you can, the man who is not
vain? and, supposing you bad discovered such a curiosity,
it then becomes another question whether he would not
have some little secret vanity or other, if we only had eyes
microscopic enough to discover the entity or nonentity of
it. You may depend upon it, the fellow would be vain,
exceedingly vain of not being vain.

JENKINS IN AMBER.
Spite of Ordnance Stevedore, &c., &c.
On the late visit of the EMPRESS EUGÉNIE,
the sensitive JENKINS seized his lyre, “strung
with his powdered hair,” and broke forth into
melodious verse and music. We cannot-we
say it with heartfelt regret-give room to all
the seven stanzas; but feel it incumbent upon
us as a great human duty to enshrine at least
eight Jenkinsonian lines in amber. Having
compared EUGÉNIE LO “MARY STUART again ;'
and then having corrected himself, saying she
is “No, not MARY! Holier Bridal,” he dashes
his fingers amongst the chords, and ends
thus :

we forbear; it is audacious to attempt to dis-
seet the fire-fly verse; we, therefore, reverently
preserve it in the amber of Punch's type. It
is said that the EMPEROR sent to the Post
office a new brass-headed cane for the poetic
perpetrator. We trust the cane will be well
used; for JENKINS's verse beats everything.

“A DAINTY DISH TO SET BEFORE
A QUEEN.”
The newspapers inform us that "in return
for the splendid tiara, value about 2,000,000
reals, recently presented to the POPE by the
QUEEN OF SPAIN, bis Holiness has sent Her
Majesty, the body of St. FELIX the Martyr."
The body of a martyr, or indeed any body, how-
ever illustrious, would seem to be but a poor
equivalent for a tiara worth 2,000,000 of reals,
and we can only presume that the POPE mis-
ook the reals for sbams when he made such a
singular return to the QUEEN OF SPAIN's gene-
rosity. We can imagine the consternation of
Her Majesty when, upon the arrival of a tremen-
dous parcel from the Pope, and amidst all the
excitement of curiosity to see what the package
contained, the discovery was made of the body
of a deceased martyr. By the gift baving been
conferred on the QUEEN OF SPAIN, we are inclined
to believe that the blessed FELIX may have been
some relation to the celebrated Don Felix, who
used to be known to playgoers as the hero of
the comedy of The Wonder. If this is the mode
in which the POPE acknowledges a favour
received, we should be sorry to place his Holiness
under an obligation, lest be might think himself
called upon to send us a “body," by way of a
graceful interchange of courtesy. The QUEEN

expected in town until the first week in May. The Galway Militia
has been much reduced by 150 of the privates having volunteered for
the line ; but, under the able management of its colonel, the regiment
is fast regaining its strength."
The spirit of the reader is a little depressed and darkened
by the intelligence that the Noble MARQUIS is still "de-
tained at Lough Rea," but is raised and tightened by the
sequent news that he may be expected in town, though not
“ until the first week in May," beautiful May! We may
expect CLANRICARDE and the chestnut blossoms about the
same time. We are glad of this; for we begin to fear that
the Noble Marquis had resolved to withdraw himself
from the House of Lords, having requested the EARL OF
CARLISLE to wipe the MARQUIS's name from the Irish
Lord Lieutenants; it was feared that he might-in an
evil hour for the moral strength and beneficent example of
the country-humbly pray HER MAJESTY to use the royal
penknife to scratch his name out of the Peerage. These
fears are, happily, groundless ; the Noble Ma Quis still
devoting all his chivalrous energies to the service of the
United Kingdom. How noble, 100, is the influence of high
example! The above informs us that "the Galway Militia
has been much reduced by 150 privates having volunteered
into the line;" all of them, no doubt, irresistibly stimulated
to the heroic act by the moral and mental influence of the
brilliant head of the regiment. However, the gaps in the
Galway Militia are as speedily filled as made; hence, with
such a man for Colonel, as a CLANRICARDE, the Galway
Militia may be made an inexhaustible receiver for the line.
In fact, the character of the Marquis of CLANRICARDE
appearing as Colonel of the Galway Militia, has been no
less prophetically, but beautifully' foreshadowed in the
“Happy Warrior" of WORDSWORTH. The whole piece is
too long to quote; but there are some lines of felicitous
significance. “Who is the Happy Warrior ?." asks the
poet; and then among other qualities that make him, says
he is one-
“ –Who if he rise to station of command,
Rises by open means; and then will stand
On honourable terms, or else retire,
And in himself possess his own desire;
Who comprehends his truth, and to the same,

INCOME TAX RESTITUTION.
To SIR CORNEWALL Lewis, Chancellor of the Exchequer.
SIR,
Let us pay for the war like men-but let us not
get it paid for by means which are unmanly. For the pre-
sent, perhaps for a long future, we must put up with the
inequality, that is, with the rascality, of the Income Tax.
But saddle the right ass and only him. The Income Tax

is a partial confiscation of incomes of £100 a year and
upwards. Don't coufiscate incomes which are below that
mark. I know some very respectable old ladies—I know
some very charming young ones—whose incomes are below
£100 a year. Don't compel them to pay the tax to which
tbey are not liable. You don't? That is inexact, you do.
From rent, from mortgage, from the funds, from wbatever
source derived, their pittance has Income Tax deducted
from it. They can get it back again. How? By taking
proper proceedings. I mean not to be cockney, but, don't
you wish they may get it? Broken-spirited widows, and
unbusiness-like, helpless, orphan girls, what proceedings
would you advise them to take for the recovery of the

the official that has ultimately to refund? Have you a
grandmother, sir, who is not a GAMP; a sister who is not

gested enterprise would be absurd. You surely would not

Well, then, now, while you are about it-whilst you are
aggravating this abominable tax-take the opportunity of
adjusting it in at least this one particular. You may not
be able to prevent it from necessarily robbing some; but
you can, surely, prevent it from robbing many unnecessarily.

THOUGHTS ON THOUGHTS.
THERE are many thoughts, like diamonds, that
take much less time to find, than to polish when
you have found them,
Many thoughts are exceedingly pretty, which,
when looked into, are found, like a necklace of
birds'-eggs, to hang upon the slightest thread, and
to have, strictly speaking, nothing in them.
Some authors, too, evidently look upon thoughts
as children do upon birds'-eggs-public property,
which there is no harm in stealing. They string
them, also, very much in the same strain; draw
ing everything they can out of them, and
decorating themselves afterwards with the empty
shells.
Old thoughts are frequently like old clothes,
you put them away, and they come out, after a
certain time, quite fresh and apparently new.
Persons repeatedly.get the credit of having a
new thought, when it is only an old one brushed
up a little, and “revived” for the occasion, to
"look as good as new.
There is no property in thoughts. Like an
umbrella, a thought only belongs to the last
holder, and you never can tell in whose bands it
may be to-morrow. The only title most thoughts
have to property is the one generally carried out
by magpies and PROUD ONS, “La Propriété c'est
le Vol."

MENSCHIKOFF was lately reported to be dead. It
appears that he was only in a trance, during which he had
a dream, which he mistook for a revelation. In his last
order of the day, on bidding his troops farewell, he assures
those prodigiously faithful soldiers that-
“The Imperial leader of the Orthodox army, now passed into eternity,
bestows his blessing from above on their fortitude and unexampled
intrepidity."
No, MENSCHIKOFF, don't say so! Your late master, let
us hope, is now at peace; his fight has been fought-he
thinks no more of war : cares about no army but the Army
of Martyrs, of which in his time he rather augmented the
ranks. His thoughts tend upwards, not downwards to the
earth; he has something better to contemplate than
human fortitude and intrepidity, bowever unexampled.
What, man, do not you believe that he is in the enjoy-
ment of the beatific vision ? Oh, MENSCHIKOFF! drag not
down the spirit of your blessed EMPEROR to battle and car-
nage. Non confundar in æternum! he said himself, but

TURKEY IN
KNIGHTSBRIDGE.
It ought to be generally
known that Turkey may now
be reached from any part of
London for sixpence. Every
one who wishes to visit the
Turkish nation, should re-
pair to St. George's Gallery,
Knightsbridge ; where it will
be seen that instead of the
Osmanlis being the weak and
effeminate race that is gene-
rally, supposed, they are
“lads of wax
in the most
literal sense, and that so far
from having no confidence
in our Turkish ally, we may
repose on the Ottoman. The
only thing that the “sick
man” is really sick of is the
style of his dress, which is
rapidly undergoing reform,
and the Ottoman calls for
re-dress as loudly as he de-
mands a remedy for his poli-
tical grievances.
The pic-
turesque Turkish robe is
rapidly being superseded by
the more convenient but less
graceful surtout or paletot,
and it is one of the objects
of the Turkish Museum to
secure an accurate repre-
sentation of a state of things
which would otherwise be
without any other record than
the wardrobe of a Theatre,
or the second-hand stock of
a Fancy Ball costumier. In
a short time we might have
nothing left on which to

PRO BONO CLERICO.
SOMEBODY advertises a Book containing “ 150
Skeleton Sermons,” which he calls Outlines for
Pulpit Preparation. These “Skeletons” will,
no doubt, be much resorted to by those Preachers
who, vulgarly speaking, may be said to "bone”
all their ideas from others. Such “ Skeletons"
will, of course, abound in denunciations of
the flesh, and every Parson who cannot write a
sermon for himself, will take care to bave one
of those “Skeletons” in his closet ready to be
brought out to terrify the alarmed consciences
of his parishioners. We fear that it is a common
practice among Clergymen to resort to these
Skeletons,” for to hear people talk of having
heard a sermon which was as dry as a bone
is a very frequent occurrence.

LORD ALBEMARLE, who is a Lord of another sort, and a really able

to do it, as hitherto, but it is needless to say that Government set
itself determinately against anything so rational.
The Commons did not do much, but SIR GEORGE GREY obtained
leave to bring in a bill for the inspection of coal mines, in order to pro-
vide some protection to the miners against the frightful accidents to
which they are at present exposed. The object is laudable, but unless
the act calls the owners of mines over their own coals in case of negli-
gence, it will be useless.

bill for Abolishing Church Rates. LORD PALMERSTON thought the

great public want-the appointment of Public Prosecutors-and to
squabble over a Parish Constables' bill.
LORD PALMERSTON however made an announcement which had
better be noticed. He stated that "informal” communications were
still going on with the Continental Powers upon the subject of peace.

A NEW CHURCH CONDUCTOR.
THE Caledonian Mercury (but then the Scotch
are such born wags !) tells a story of an infirm,
bed-ridden old lady, who, incapable of going to
church, took a house adjoining the building, and,
that she might hear the service,“ had a gutta
percha conductor actually led into her bed.”
This is certainly " laying on” religion, and at
High Church Service. We hear that, improving
on this hint, a company is about to be started,
to be called the "Belgravian Purple Stocking
Redemption," which has for its object the laying
on of Puseyism, with every variety of "intoning,"
from St. Barnabas throughout the adjoining
district. A due allowance will be made to
families. Sermons in stones are an old, familiar
sort of discourse; but homilies through gutta
percha must come with a very “melodious
twang." Indeed, we do not see why the pipes
might not be conducted from Rome itself, into
the very bosom of Belgravia. It would be
something to have the Pope, like rolls, hot every
morning.

THE ORDER OF THE HOT AIR BATH.
To the LORD CHAMBERLAIN.
What noble lord or lady, being heir,
Or heiress, both of property and brains,
Would barter for St. James's heated air
The vernal breezes of their own domains ?
Aristocratic noses are allowed
The finest in this world of ours to be.
Can they prefer a close, though courtly, crowd,
To clover-bloom, and Zephyr breathing free?
The fair VERBENA, beautifully drest,
Some hours was hustled in a crowd like that
At the last Drawing Room, and so compressed,
She passed before her SOVEREIGN nearly flat.
Her dress, of satin, silk, and moire antique,
And tulle, was rumpled, crumpled, rent, and torn.
And she looked quite a figure, so to speak,
Of feathers, wreaths, festoons, and flounces shorn.
Through a long passage, striving, steaming, soaked,
To fight by tedious inches it was hers,
Now by ill-managed rapiers being poked,
Now being scratched by clumsily worn spurs.
She blessed Court trains, of splendid matrons well
Devised excessive ankles to conceal;
Of those“ potatoes” which refuse to tell
Dug out of silken hose by rowelled heel.
POLONIUS ! thou that, with thy white and long
Stick, dost o'er courtly sacred rites preside,
Canst thou do nought to thin this reeking throng,
Wherein BRITANNIA's noblest fat is fried ?
Go, now to FARADAY; bid him declare
If limewater will be made chalky less,
By the car bonic acid in the air,
Exhaled by Beauty and High-Mightiness.
And in a narrow space if, cheek by jowl,
You pen folks up, the same result there comes

A LENTEN ENTERTAINMENT.
MADAME GRISI has been "prevailed upon to have a few more "Last
Nights.” We have nothing to say against this arrangement, as the
public will be only the gainer by it, but it is scarcely fair that GRISI
herself should be the loser. And yet there is the fact boldly stated in
the advertisements, and where is the man of much little faith as to
doubt an advertisement? By those oracles of truth we are informed
that, under such and such circumstances, that are by far too pathetic
to relate, MADAME GRISI, -
“ With her accustomed kindness, has consented to lend the Directors her invaluable
services."
There, you see, that Gris does not give her services, but merely
“lends” them. It is the first instance of a similar loan we ever met
with, especially in an Italian Opera Singer, because Opera Singers have
been rather distinguished in this country for getting as much as they
could for their “invaluable services." How different to the mercenary
feeling as displayed by one WAGNER, who laid down the bold axiom
that "England was to be valued only for its money.' The loan, too,
is to be continued for ten nights! You never bear of a Prime Minister,
or a Field Marshal, or an Archbishop of Canterbury, “lending.” his
services; no, the liberality is reserved for a Prima Donna, who delays
taking possession of ber villa purposely to ennoble the gift. However,
we hope the Directors will never be mean enough to accept the
"invaluable services” of MADAME GRIsi upon the terms stated in the
above advertisement; or, at all events, that they will be induced by a
like spirit of liberality to lend her, in return for the services lent on the
ten nights during this Grisi Lenten Entertainment, a small sum of
several thousand pounds, in addition to the brougham, and the table,
and the bouquets and diamond bracelets, that are usually “lent” to
Prima Donnas on similar occasions. It would be too bad if GRISI, after
stopping in this country on purpose, was a loser by her kindness; and
we should not be astonished to hear of her having purchased another
Villa with the proceeds of her liberality. It is but fair that a favour so
handsomely “lent ” should meet with a return as handsome as itself.
TO THE DIRTY BOY.—(FROM HIS NURSE).
O, JIM, you should bridle your tongue,
Or into grief it will get you-
You should have corrected, when young,
The vice that always beset you.

Awful complaints you lodge,
Shaking your head imposingly;
Coming the sorrowful dodge-
Carneying, blarneying, glozingly.
Even your north country burr,

Helps your palaver and purr, -
But GRAHAMS should have good memories.
How could you go for to charge
LAYARD with slaying poor CHRISTIE ?
Invention may wander at large,
But yours is so blessedly misty.
Always beware of a fact
Recorded in HANSARD'S Ephemeris,

But-GRAHAMS should bave good memories.
Now, MASTER JIM, it appears,
Of your words you've had to make luncheon,
The public has met you with jeers,
And Punch with a whack from his truncheon ;

Rousing the national phlegm, or his,-
Never mind bow you're annoyed-

this point of not very masculine perfection to which we are tending,
take the following paragraph from the Times :-
"MAINE LIQUOR LAW.-Last night a public meeting respectably attended was held

Well, but if it be a right principle that we should have ourselves
divested of the means of doing wrong, that method of getting prevented
from the commission of excess ought not merely to be applied to the
desire of drink. Gluttony is equally a vice with drunkenness, and if

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE POST-OFFICE IN A BLAZE.
We lately had our eyes very uncomfortably dazzled by
the sight of the Postmen in a glaring red uniform, more
fitted for the Fire Brigade than for a peaceful body of men
connected with the department of litera humaniores, as
the carriers of letters. "We cannot comprehend the taste
which has pinned a large pair of scarlet skirts to the coat
of the Postman, and caused us to mistake him for a sen-
tinel off his post, by his resemblance to a Foot Guardsman
in one of the new regulation wrappers. Considering that
there is a Reward payable for the apprehension of a
Deserter, we wonder that half the Postmen in London are
pot taken into custody every night on suspicion of their
having deserted from one of the Infantry regiments.
We can see no necessity whatever for the military aspect
which is given to these men; and indeed in these war times
it is enough to alarm half the old women in London, to have
their portals thundered at every hour of the day by men
of military aspect. In the days of distinction between the
town and country post there might have been some cause
for the red coats of the latter, if it were only for the sake
of the mild joke that used to be perpetrated, by asking
the London Postman-“Well, Two-Penny, how's the
General ?” We recommend the immediate abolition of this
very martial attire, which is likely to cause some delay in
the delivery of letters, by elevating the Postman into a very
formidable rival to the Policeman, in those little flirtatious
with our female servants, which have often kept a senti-
mental Constable grunting hoarse nothings into our House-
maid's ear, while some burglarious gentleman has been
emptying our neighbour's, plate-chest. Now that the
Postman is rendered so killing by his military costume, we
can scarcely hope that the Cooks who take in the letters
all the way down Fleet Street, will allow him to reach 85
with his usual punctuality.
The Post-Office is in every other respect a Model Depart-
ment, and the new costume has probably not originated
from its heads, which are too much occupied with improving
our means of communication to be able to bestow much time
on the cut and colour of the Postmen's attire. Perhaps

AN EXPRESS TRAIN.
THE Train of LADY FIDDLE-FADDLE's Court Dress started with her
Ladyship inside from the station at St. James's Palace, at ten minutes
to Three, and reached its destination in less than three hours and forty
minutes. This trip has been cited everywhere as a marvel of extra-
ordinary rapidity, and we are informed that it would have been even
quicker, if there had not been so many trains starting at the same time.
The most conspicuous of these was the well-known “Train of Con-
fusion," arising from the fact of a thousand persons being crammed
into a confined space scarcely capable of accommodating a hundred.
The result was that this Train kept getting in the way of all the others,
upsetting nearly everybody, until at last it completely blocked up the
line. At one period, serious fears were entertained that her Ladyship
would have to put back, for at one of the sharpest turnings her Train
became entangled between two old buffers, supposed to belong to a
parliamentary train, who ran against it with all their weight, and nearly
fore it to pieces. However, by means of the most strenuous
exertions,
the buffers were removed, when it being discovered that her Ladyship's
carriage was not much the worse for the violence of the sbock, ber
Train was again put in motion, and proceeded along the remainder of
the parrow passage with comparative ease and safety, accomplishing
the journey in the above incredible space of time. We are happy to
state that LADY FIDDLE-FADDLE reached home full five minutes before
dinner was ready, and alighted from her Train amid the congratulations
of her friends. From inquiries since made at her Ladyship's mansion,
we learn that about half-a-dozen yards of satin and as many of gold
fringe will cover the extent of the damage.

AN INTERMINABLE FRENCH PLAY.
THE French dramatists are determined to make up for
any deficiency in the quality of their dramas by an excess of
quantity. A piece is now in preparation which is to com-
prise a period of about 2,000 years, and which is to occupy
about four nights in the performance. This very prolix
production is to be called Paris, and is to commence with
the time of JULIUS CÆSAR, who is to be cne of the principal
characters in some few of the early acts.
It is to be presumed tbat the public will be allowed to
remain at the theatre and occupy the private boxes as
sleeping-rooms—which, by the way, is sometimes the case
when the performance lasts for only a few hours, instead
of occupying the best part of a week. An attendant of the
theatre will probably be employed to go round for the boots
placed at the box-doors, after the fall of the curtain at mid-
night; and shaving water will be brought round in the
morning to enable the audience to get up and dress by the
time the next act begins. The milkman will probably call
on the pit at about 6 p.m., and hot coffee may be had,
perhaps, at the stalls, by the usual breakfast hour.
Considering the high price of lodgings in Paris during the
Exhibition, it will really be cheaper to take a box at the
theatre for the few days which the new piece will occupy
in performance; and opportunity may be taken to run out
between the acts, for the purpose of seeing what else may
be worth seeing in the Capital, besides the drama which
bears its name. No prices of admission can be considered
very exorbitant at a theatre where one is entitled to spend
nearly a whole week in witessing a single play.
The idea of uniting an hotel and a theatre—the seats at
the latter being allowed to serve the purpose of the apart-
ments at the former, is an exceedingly good one; and if the
charges for refreshments are only moderate, the speculation
will no doubt meet with very general patronage. The seats
should of course be cushioned sufficiently to serve the pur-
pose of beds for the audience; and there should be time
enough allowed for meals, between the acts. If these
arrangements are well carried out, the plan will, in all
probability, be exceedingly popular.

SIR JAMES GRAHAM completed the measure of his abasement by a
dismal speech, in which he declared that the war ought to end, for we
had got all that we wanted, and that the honour of Russia ought to be
considered. He admitted that when in office, he had made the limita-
tion of the Russian navy one of his demands, but said he had not
intended that the demand should be adhered to, and now that he
was out of office, he felt that it was unjust.
SIDNEY HERBERT took the s same view, but his nature revolted
against the humiliation which GRAHAM and GLADSTONE did not mind,
and he was specially indignant at the idea of its being believed that he
was a party to a wilfully inefficient prosecution of the war. Mr. Punch is
willing to believe that SIDDY (whoj has many merits) did all that
stronger men would allow him to do.
LORD JOHN RUSSELL tried to get rid of the debate altogether, but
failed, as he now usually does, in most things which he attempts.
MR. BRIGHT made a pugnacious speech for peace, and bewailed the
heavy taxation of the war, but Mr. Punch, holding all MR. BRIGHT's
premises to be rotten (he does not of course allude to his manufactory),
all bis arguments to be sophistical, and all his deductions to be
ridiculous, is bound to say that the tone and manner of his speech was
worthy of the occasion, and in strong contrast to the littleness of his

WHERE DOES THE RAIN COME FROM?
It is most surprising the quantity of rain that has fallen
lately, and we cannot find a cause for it. We have even
rushed to that great spring of all overflows, that mighty
fountain-head of all cataracts, Vauxhall, but as we find
its doors closed in our face, we are at a loss to find the key
-the turn-key that is to open the mystery of the prodigious
reservoir of water that AQUARIUS has recently let loose
over our heads. It is cruel to be denied even the comfort
of attributing to the barometrical influence of Vauxhall
opening the calamity of so much pluvial moisture. The
beauty is, that Vesuvius has been quietly smoking all
the while, and yet you would have supposed that the rain,
every drop of which was worthy of a fine day at Man-
chester, would have effectually put its pipe out long
ago.
We call entreatingly upon Sir Peter Laurir, if he
wishes to rescue the sinking fortunes of Rosherville and
Cremorne from drowning, to exercise his magisterial
authority in “putting down ”the rain. If not, we shall
have no ducks and green peas this year; for our provincial
meteorologists inform us that every gosling is dying as fast
as it can from premature rheumatism, brought on by having
slept for the last five weeks in nothing but damp beds.
They haven't as much as a dry feather about them; even
their web-feet will no longer act as goloshes in keeping out
the wet. For the love of onions, then, we implore of SIR
PETER to take a judicial mop in hand, and to twirl back
again in the face of nature a few buckets of the dirty water
that she has been amusing herself for days past in chucking
over our poor drenched bodies to that monstrous extent, that
we fancy you might take up a policeman, and squeeze him
until the water ran out of him as out of a sponge. We feel
as though it would require nothing short of a Fire of

dry again.

BRIGHT IDEAS.
Stick wholly to business and mind nothing
else. If you go to war you are sure to lose men
and spend money. The worst that could befal
you in consequence of not resisting Russia would
be subjugation under the Czar. If all the world
would submit to the Czar there would be no
fighting. There would be no armies and navies
to maintain; and the expenses of mankind would
be almost limited to the sum required for the
maintenance of one man and his family in luxury.
The monarch could have no ambition to gratify,
as he would be master of this planet, and it
would be impossible for him to invade the moon.
The satisfaction of any other passions that he
could have would cost comparatively little.
Taxation would be moderate under the govern.
ment of a universal despot. The people at large
would not suffer much from any tyranny which
they were content to obey. They would be
deprived of very little true liberty. They would
enjoy all the liberty of the Press that is worth
having; the liberty of printing and publishing
news.
No tyrant, whose power was unlimited, would
have any inducement to restrict manufactures
and commerce. Perfect freedom of trade would
exist; that is, perfect freedom of all desirable
action. Very few tyrants inflict upon their sub-
jects injuries wholly gratuitous. The most male-
volent despot would torture but small numbers
of an unresisting people. The sum total of
atrocities which such a sovereign could perpe-
trate would fall far short, in amount, of the
horrors of war. Individuals and families, here
and there, might be subjected to unjust exaction,
outrage, and whipping. But the majority would
escape the extortion, the dishonour, and the lash.
The maximum of income and the minimum of
taxation constitute the greatest happiness of the
greatest number, and the political summum bonum.

INTERESTING TO PORTUGUESE BONDHOLDERS.
These naturally-anxious individuals will be happy to know that his
young and green MAJESTY OF PORTUGAL is now in Paris, and so full
of money, that he is giving away orders in all the prodigality of youth.
He has just bestowed upon PRINCE NAPOLEON the Order of the Tower
and the Sword. This Order gives the lucky knight the privilege to wear
a silver collar (at his own cost) with the inscription" Valour, Loyalty,
Merit.” The Portuguese Government-now happily represented by
His MAJESTY PEDRO II.-have bestowed Orders of a very different
sort upon its English Bondholders and Creditors. They have in many
cases revived the Order of the Queen's Bench and the Key, with the
privilege of wearing a collar of parchment, with the inscription,
Gullability, Poverty, and No Credit.”
As another delightful instance of the moral heroism of the young King,
we have to state that His Majesty last week visited the French Mint,
where “he followed the operations of coining.”-şay the accounts
“with great attention.” How like bis progenitors ! '"Plates of gold
were cast for bis inspection, and there was shown gold ready to be
thrown into the crucible to the amount of nearly a million.” Surely
this was very unnecessary trouble. Had the gold been placed in the
hands of His Majesty, to the credit of Portugal, it would, have been
as completely melted as in any crucible soever. Bondholders have
already seen more millions of theirs melted in the national crucible of
Portugal, ---nine millions subjected to "the different operations of
coining” by the Portuguese State, and followed
by, Portuguese royalty
with great attention.” For our vulgar, common-place part, we wonder
that any King of Portugal could touch a piece of his own coin without
remorseful shuddering. There is a monkish legend, that money being
extorted by a sinful tax, a piece of the coin dropt blood in the hand of
the ruler who bad levied the impost. Could this miracle be repeated in
Portugal, how much of its coin would weep the blood and tears of
cheated Englishmen, their widows and orphans ?
Song by an Elector of Middlesex.
I'm a Middlesex Elector; equal rights, I say for all:
Sauce for goose is sauce for gander; make one law for great and small.

For the servants of the trader, is his Bill's intent professed,
Milk and mackerel crying after nipe on Sunday morn 'twill stop;
And against the hungry close the butcher's and the baker's shop.
Whilst this Lord regales on dainties, whilst on luxuries he dines,
Whilst he gorges on rich viands, whilst he swills delicious wines;
He deprives his poorer neighbours of their humble Sunday cheer,
Baked potatoes, shoulder of mutton, onion sauce, and pot of beer.
He, whose Act betimes to breakfast will compel all common men,
Will he take none on a Sunday, should be lie abed till ten?
Will he, self-denying, practise the religion of the Tub?
Poor folks of refreshment barring, will this man frequent his Club?
You, on others Sunday's burden, grievous to be borne, who lay,
Do you, with your little finger, touch it not, my Lord, I pray?
From the bondage you impose on them do you yourself exempt ?
If you do, oh, how you merit indiguation and contempt!

That's your liberal Member! shall he ever more your Member be?
Oh by all means let us choose him us to represent again!

THE LORD MAYOR'S VISIT TO PARIS.
We are happy to find that the LORD MAYOR will have a chronicler
worthy of himself and the great occasion that took him to Paris. When
HENRY THE FIFTH invaded France, he took with him certain court
historiographers who, each with book and stylus in hand, sat on the
baggage-waggons, and took notes, as we say now, of the meeting. When
HENRY THE EIGHTH went to the Cloth of Gold, he too carried with
him a cunning writer to set down all the events of the scene. We are
happy to find that London's LORD MAYOR has been similarly attended
upon in his visit to the land of the Gaul, where was so magnificently
celebrated the Field of the Table-Cloth. It is said that his
Lordship;
in imitation of HENRY THE EIGHTH after the third bottle, jocosely laid
| his hand upon the collar of BARON HAUSMANN, Prefect of the Seine, and
said, -"Will you wrastle, brother ?”—but that the baron, in condes-
cension to his Lordship, courteously declined. We have grown wiser,
more refined, since the days of FRANCIS, and do not now, out of sheer
hospitality, lay our guest under the table.
We are bound to state that the LORD MAYOR has very beautifully
represented the genius, the worth, the eloquence of the City of London;
for he wore his magnificent state robes, and had his mace caried before
him, whilst six footmen, with many ingots beaten out upon their backs,
were behind him. From one of these footmen—the rogue thinks that

side, his Voyage, and Further Progress to Paris, with all that awaited
him there.
The reader will be fully convinced that the Chronicle will, in every
way be worthy of the theme, when he is informed that it is the work

The nursemaid walks in peace, nor dreads
To hear a loud and savage roar,

No longer agitation feels,
Lest she be pinned against the wall -

RUMOURED LAST APPEARANCE IN THE PULPIT.
Our true blue contemporary, John Bull, perplexes us with the fol-
lowing paragraph :-
“ DR. M'NEILE,– It is stated that the Rev. DR. M`Neile, having by the death of a
near relative come into a handsome competency, is about to retire into private life.”
We can understand that the succession to a handsome competency
might induce an actor to retire into private life from the stage fast
enough; but cannot well conceive it occasioning a clergyman to "cut”
the pulpit with similar alacrity.

PREMIUMS FOR PUBLIC SERVICE.
In advocating the claim of CAPTAIN M'CLURE, the discoverer of the
northwest passage, to a reward for his services on the ground of
precedent as well as justice, the Times says-
" SIR EDWARD PABRY, who reached 110° west longitude, received £5000 and knight-

Such a man as PARRY is rewarded with £5,000 for his services once
in his life. An average Bishop is rewarded with the same sum every
year. How much more serviceable than such a man as PARRY ought
an average Bishop to be to the British public !

We care not for the flag of truce-we hold such matters light-

But we'll let thee see how gallantly the Russian troops can fight.
'Twas off the port of Hango that the good ship, Cossack, lay;
Thereon one hundred Muscovites their triggers boldly drew;
From us the British pirates had taken her away.
And first they shot the men ashore, then fired upon the crew.
She sent her cutter to us, a flag of truce that bore;

And our hearts beat high as their bark came nigh' the holy Russian Before our aim, as the feathered game-as the robin-redbreasts-fall.

As fierce as bears, as brave as kites, on board the boat we sprung.
There stood one gallant Muscovite alone upon the strand;
Some of the wounded, to the waves, with fearless hearts we flung,
But he retired, with reason good, before they gained the land.
And others on the jetty to our valiant comrades threw,

Their boat is moored securely; ashore we have that band;
Of Alma and of Inkermann we leave the Allies to boast,
A flag of truce is waving in their officer's right hand.
So glorious a victory now we've won on Hango's coast.
Aloft the flag of truce shall bang-a trophy for the Czar-

They cannot brag of such a flag among their spoils of war.
