ROTHER JONATHAN,+Your friend Punch makes you the very handsome Christmas offering of this,
his Twenty-NINTH VolumE. The best of friends will now and then have little wrinkles of temper; but
then a little calm consideration, a little tolerance towards one another, smoothes them out, and all is clear again.
So, dear JonATHAN, let it be with you and me, even with JonATHAN and PUNCH, as the two representatives of
the great Saxon family; between whom let there be nothing rougher than Atlantic billows.
Long before GEORGE WASHINGToN spun his peg-top, your friend PUNCH was a bit of living, stirring
wood—the real lignum vitae—in hearty England. Genealogists, with a small envy, have dated the family of
PUNCH no later than the time of QUEEN ANNE. I have, I hope, a very proper contempt of this heraldic
disparagement. I believe the family tree to have sprung from an acorn dropt, and mysteriously picked up, and
as secretly dropt again in more congenial soil, from an oak of the Druids. Be this as it may, the deeds of
PUNCH have become his ancestors: and how many of your forefathers have laughed and meditated, and given
their coppers, small but willing oblations at the shrine, that is, stage, of Punch. You and he, JonATHAN, both
speak a common language. When Punch cries out in the streets, does not JonATHAN regard him :
I am most happy to find, dear friend, that Christmas will close in about us, and find us once more
heart-whole and amicable. Pray give a hint—and one of the strongest—to PREsi DENT PIERCE to put a muzzle
now and then upon his ATToRNEY-GENERAL. Here has that amiable lawyer been doing his best to blow red coals
between England and the States, and that too at a time when the heartiest good wishes and best sympathies
of JonATHAN ought to attend upon his relations. Ought, say I? Why, they do. This is plain enough : for
hardly has the lawyer aforesaid blown-off half his steam of verbiage, than the strong common sense, the good
kindly heart of America spoke out, and warmed up, and declared that the very thought of another quarrel with
England was a monstrous folly and a huger crime. And so MR, ATToRNEY-GENERAL nationally snubbed, became
suddenly as quiet and as dumb as a defunct raven.

iv. PREFACE. [December 29, 1855.
Among other scandals, it was wickedly preached to your discredit, JonATHAN–rather let me say to your
indignation—that the American eagle was to keep company awhile with the eagle of Muscovy, swooping
alike at the same quarry, ravening alike on the same victims. We should as soon think of seeing the
small pig-tail of BENJAMIN FRANKLIN–(a relic, of course in the possession of the respected MR. BARNUM)
— enlarged and elongated into the knout of the CzAR. We should as soon believe that the key of
FRANKLIN that sublimed his soul with the conviction that he had drawn down the electric fire from the
clouds, could be fitted to the lock of a dungeon for the liberty of the human race. No ; no, JonATHAN 1
As it is sometimes said of cocks, so PUNCH says of the likelihood of the conjoined American and Russian
eagles, those eagles won’t fight !
Let us, then, for all future time take good heed that we be mutually moderate; mutually
forbearing. As for that matter of Cuba, I confess, I can hardly see why, if you paid for it, you should
not have it. I don’t think it would prove the bargain, even at a gift—(and Spain is quite as likely to give
as she is to pay)—that you in your present exaltation believe it. Cuba is called a jewel: nevertheless, is
there not a little too much black blood in the ruby to make it very valuable to yourself, all Southern
circumstances considered 7
Any way, Jonath AN, let us, at this season, making long arms, shake hands across the Atlantic,
Let our amity remain as green as holly leaves, our hearts unspotted by black as the holly berries. And
so to the end let all “asperities” be worn away.
“That the smooth temper of our age may be
Like the high leaves upon the holly tree.”
You may acknowledge this Christmas tribute in any cordial manner—after your own cordial nature
—you may please. A few bouquets the more, an extra cheer or so, to our literary plenipotentiary,
WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THAcKERAY now in the States, will be blithely taken in full quittance, by
Dear JonATHAN,
Your Affectionate Friend
(FoR THE People of ENGLAND),
púð.

FIRE HIS 29 POu N DER.
TO
PUNCH'S ESSENCE
MONDAY, June 25th., IN the Commons the FIRST LORD or THE
ADMIRALTY apprised the house of the actual extent of the º
atrocity; and also mentioned the ºlºr, lies by which the
Russian authorities affected to , vindicate it. It appears that the
ruffians at Hango murdered outright but six of the boat's crew, (two
their own fellow-subjects), and wounded the same number, the
remainder of the party being made prisoners. The Russians pretend,
first, that they did not see the flag of truce; and, secondly, that they
had been irritated into firing upon it, by learning that elsewhere
soundings had been taken under the protection of such an ensign; a
third lie, no such thing having ever been done. From the contemptu-
ously inconsistent character of the answer, it is manifest that the
Russians glory in one of the foulest crimes ever perpetrated.
LoRD PALMERStoN announced, that the government meant to throw
over the bill for dealing with Doctors' Commons, and some important
Scotch, and Irish bills. He also proposed that the question of
education—about which there could of course be no hurry—should
stand over until next year. He would pass, if he could, the bill for
transferring the Ordnance property to the SECRETARY AT WAR, the bill
regarding Limited Partnership, and the Board of Health bills. Mr.
Punch reserves his sentiments upon the utility of Parliaments until
he sees whether even this modified programme be carried out.
The Premier made a much more satisfactory announcement, in
stating that our losses in the late gallant attack on the Redan, though
they are not to be jºken of lightly, were very small compared to the
estimate at first made.
The rest. of the night was occupied with Lord John Russell's
unconstitutional constitutions for Victoria and New South Wales, and
towards the end of the debate many members had acquired a tolerably
| distinct idea as to what part of the world those places were situate in.
OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday—In the Lords, LoRD LyNDHURST made another of his
masterly exposures of the conduct of #: Austria, and our Foreign
Office, in regard to the war. He deliberately declared, that he had no
confidence in Prussia, and that the “subserviency. of that wretched
nation to Russia, deprived her of “the title to be called an independent
power.” He owned to having had some hope of Austria, as a i.
country under a young and spirited monarch, but she had also turne
craven, and was in a state of “humiliation.” He showed how Russia
had first bamboozled and then scoffed at our negociator, of whom, the
old Tory was unkind enough to say, that he never knew a man involved
in difficulties and perplexities extricate himself from them with more
address and dexterity than that noble lord, and he believed that the noble
lord would voluntarily place himself in situations of difficulty, in order
to exert his skill in escaping from them. But upon this occasion the
artful dodger had been done. Finally, he was so good as tº remind
LoRD PALMERston that the present crisis was one of exceeding difficulty,
and that though he had come into office amid º: applause, he
must mind most particularly well what he was about, if he meant to
preserve either applause or office. LQRD CLARENDON grumbled that
Austria, and Germany in general, should be spoken of disrespectfully,
but admitted that we had failed in bringing them to behave decently,
and added, that the result was that France and England were now
unfettered, and might'make any peace they pleased-a great triumph, as
those ..º. †: However, they have a little more war to
make before they make any peace. - - - -
In the č. LoRD Robert GrosvenoR intimated that he did
not believe that the people were opposed to his Sunday Trade Bill, and
that he meant to go on with it. How is this man to be convinced?
He has written a letter objecting to being thrown into the Serpentine,
and really one does not know what process of conviction would be

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
acceptable to him. MR, MILNER GIBson, who has had no indigmation
to spare to the Hango massacre by the Russians, had, and let off ever
so much about some old pots and pans, which have been smashed by
the Allies in the Kerteh museum.
MR. ToM DUN.com BE raised the question, whether BARON Roths-l
CHILD, by taking the Government loan, had not disqualified himself
from sitting in the House, which will not admit him because he is a
Jew. A select committee is to consider the matter.
The Sunday Beer Act was then made the subject of an edifying dis-
cussion, in the course of which SiR George GREY, following LoRD
Robert GrosvenoR, expressed his belief, that it was not the humbler
classes who opposed the measure, but their betters, whose amusements
were interfered with. Will SIR. GeoRGE GREY do Mr. Punch the
honour of taking a seat in his pew next Sunday morning, and after-
wards of accompanying the reverend gentleman on a round of visits
among his poor. It would be a work of mercy, and therefore quite
F. on Sunday, and it would prevent SIR. George from talking, in
uture (upon one subject at least) what Mr. Punch must, in the
olitest manner, characterise as abominable nonsense. The act has
een, in the meantime, consigned to a committee, who are to inquire
into its working. The people will now have an opportunity of stating
their grievances.
Leave was given to bring in a bill, which will not be allowed to go
much further, by reason of its evident justice, namely, a measure for
giving a vote to everybody who pays income tax, and a resolution was
carried to the effect, that the present duties on stage-carriages were
unjust. When the requisite alterations are made, a law should be
assed prohibiting omnibus proprietors from varying the rate of their
ares more than five times in one week.
Wednesday. The Maynooth nuisance.
Thursday. The War Minister announced a very excellent step. We
recruit 1000 men a-week, but this is not enough, and therefore it is
intended to double the pay of the soldier who is actually in the field,
and to invest this additional money for him in, a Savings Bank
(guaranteed, we trust), to be paid either to him on his return, or “to
those whom he may hold most dear,” should he fall.
The Commons made some progress with the Metropolis Management
Bill, and with an Irish Tenants Compensation Bill, into the discussion
on which latter were imported some of the usual amenities which many
Irish members mistake for dignified self-assertion.
Friday. In the Lords, Lord BRough AM called attention to the
present highly satisfactory system by which º: to their Lordships
are disposed of. These Appeals are naturally left to the law-lords, and
if only two of these personages attend, and happen to differ in opinion,
the decision of the Court below is always confirmed. BRough AM
seemed to think that the unlucky appellant ought to have a little fair
play, and that more lords ought to attend... But he quite forgot that
the Lord CHANCELLOR, when he sits in the Lords to hear an appeal
against his own decision below, wears an entirely different and far more
imposing wig than that in which he sits in Chancery, and this gives
great consolation to a suitor.
In the Commons, PALMERston admitted that Austria was sending
home an immense number of her soldiers, and thereby rendering invalu-
able service to Russia, by releasing a proportionate Russian force from
the duty of observation. But PAMsaid, that the plea was that the health
of the Austrian soldiers required this change. Mr. Punch has always
believed Austria too indisposed to fight.
MR. CAYLEY made a great complaint, that LoRD CANNING should be
the new Governor-General of India, when he, CAYLEY, had considered
that LoRD ELGIN ought to be the man. Mr. Punch really does not
see what right old Mr. CAYLEY has to nominate the representatives of
HER MAJESTY in India, and suggests to that ancient agriculturist,
that he had better mind his chaff-cutter, and leave Cal-cutta alone.
SIR CHARLEs Wood announced, that the Government will not have
anything to do with LoRD DUNDONALD's annihilating invention...That
being settled, if we were LoRD DUNDONALp, we would make the ex-
eriment off our own bat, in a way which should convince everybody.
et him utterly annihilate some abominable place in the very heart of
London. A happy thought. Mr. Punch hereby offers him Holywell
Street. Let that nuisance, and all that therein is, disappear, some
night, and the very next Gazette will announce that LoRD DUNDoNALD,
with a step up the peerage, is gone out to pulverise Cronstadt.
The very useful Bill by which it will be made possible for a person to
invest his money in assisting another's business or speculation, without
involving himself beyond the amount so invested—in other words, a
measure for preventing partners from ruining one another, was read a
second time.
The evening and the week were º: to a pleasant termination
by another Irish row, upon the subject of Lunatic Asylums in Ireland.
oney has been advanced for these institutions, and the Irish, when
called upon to make arrangements for repaying it, º: to pick
a quarrel instead. Still, Mr. Punch does not think that MR. BULL would
object, if ten times as much money were expended in this method of
providing for people, who are evidently unfit to have charge of their
own affairs.

A HOPELESS CASE IN HANOWER SQUARE.
THE old Philharmonic on Monday evening last week closed a career,
which, there is too much reason to apprehend, it will never resume.
The aged party had been in declining health for some years, but might,
perhaps, have gone on for a few more, at a jog-trot pace, by sticking to
that. Urged, however, by the advice of some well-meaning but inju-
dicious friends, the unhappy invalid, with impaired faculties, attempted
to advance to some extent in accordance with modern ideas, but halted
far behind them, and got exhausted in the effort. The supporters failed
and refused their office, and the constitution was threatening to break
up, when DR, WAGNER was called in as a desperate resource: but
under his hands the patient became rapidly worse, and now lies in an
insensible state with little hope of recovery.

It having been buzzed about Belgravia, that the mob intended on
Sunday last (see his lordship's letter in the Times) to throw Lond
Robert GRosyºnok into the Serpentine, a few benevolent ladies of the
neighbourhood, late on Saturday evening, sent his lordship a very
handsome cork jacket,

MOTICE TO CORRESPONDENTS.
MR. PUNCH is never too proud to accept assistance from his humbler
fellow-labourers in the great work of civilisation. Having recently ob-
served, in the columns of a provincial contemporary, the following
vigorous reply to some presumptuous person who had offered strictures
on the Editor's conduct of the paper, }. Punch immediately embalms
and adopts it. He requests that this model sentence, which he quotes
literatin, and in which severity, determination, and terseness are com-
bined with unparalleled felicity, may be accepted as Mr. Punch's answer
to any and every person who may henceforth dare to complain of any-
thing in these pages, or to request abstinence from future censure :-
“We have, evidently, gall'd the withers of some misereant, mayhap, some political adven-
turer, or blackleg, and we shall not withdraw the lash, till the beast, whoever he may be, has
spared Creation the infamy of his presence.”

4 - PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
INDEMNITY FOR THE WAR.
HE Cochin-China Cock—that
vain long-legged nuisance in
| scanty feathers—is the allowed
disturber of the peace of
families. All orderly people
have a crow to pick with him.
We are, however, rejoiced to
learn, that another’sort of
cock—a cock from the Black
Sea—according to the papers
—“is likely to prove a for-
§ midable rival” to the Chanti-
à cleer of Confucius. It is alto-
ź gether a more handsome,
# more delicate bird; for “it is
crested, and has feathered
legs; ” whereas the manner
in which the Cochins stalk
| about before their pantaloons
are feathered is, at least, un-
comfortable to the eye of the
benevolent. Now, as respects
the Crimean Cock:—
“Its most distinguishing peculi-
arity is in the arrangement of the
tail feathers. These are very few,
and do not project as in other birds,
but drop down and lie close to the body,
so that the creature appears tailless,
and when its head is erect scarcely
has the appearance of a bird.”
How capitally will this
Crimean ock—with his
- - - feathers down, with no appa-
rent tail—remain to us in our farm-yards, a living useful testimony of our triumph over
Russia. JoHN BULL will fondly treasure the bird as his own—the Cock of the Black Sea.
But the great blessing, bestowed º quiet people will be in the utter destruction, as
promised, of the Cochin-China Cock by the &c. º the Crimea. At present Cochin-China
is horribly obstreperous ! . How frightful, in these early mornings, is Cochin-China’s “cock-a-
doodle-do!” How pleasing to, think, that with the triumph of the Crimean Cock, the
Cochin’s “cock-a-doodle-do,” will be a “Cock-a-doodle-done?”
SOYER'S BIVOUAC COOKERY.
1M. Soyer has favoured the Times with “some of the most important receipts concocted out
of the soldier's rations.” Marvellous has been the Frenchman's cunning exercised on mere
salted pork, and common household onions. He has immortalised the great Turkish General
in a dish of “Stewed Salt Beef and Pork & la OMAR PASHA:” he has, moreover, stood
Nº. to a mess of raisins, fat treacle, &c., calling the compound—“Cossack's Pudding.”
O
ALEXIS SoYER has communicated the receipts subjoined:—
PoTAGE & la ABERDEEN.
Take the leanest rib of the leanest Isle of Skye sheep; if a sheep is not to be had, try the
old leather of the regimental bagpipe. Take three thistles; pluck away the down, and
carefully skin the thistles. If for two quarts of soup, split two peas. Skimming is not
necessary.
MoNSTER PLUMPUDDING & la GLADSTONE.
A pudding for six hundred and fifty-eight, Take a handful of raisins, stone them; divide the
stones into, say a hundred equal parts; and after shaking them together, divide the º into
five hundred more. Crack three eggs (from any mare's nest) and beat together. t your
shreds of lemon-peel be excessively candied. Take another handful of raisins of the sun,
with half as many currants of the moonshine. Thicken with flour at will. Stir with an
Exchequer tally, and boil in a pudding-cloth from an Oxford surplice.
BoILED BEEF & la SIR JAMES GRAHAM.
Choose any beef, except the beef of a Nineveh bull, for it is too tough for the purposes
of a bouilli §: Boil, in salt water, and flavour with onions (the Netherby sort are the
best if at hand). Flavour the liquor with a yarn of any sort.
PIGEON PIE a la PEACE PARTY.
If no pigeons or doves are to be had, take a Russian duck. If a duck is not to be had,
take a gull. If no gull is at hand, anything will do as well. The only necessary precaution
to be taken for a Peace Pie is this, -whatever may be contained within the dish, there must
be pigeon's feet i. ing out of the crust. These made with paste, and varnished with egg
-(if Manchester-laid the better)-will serve all purposes.
. PARISIAN BAKINGs CAREFULLY ATTENDED To-It must be confessed, that our drama-
tists and actors of the present day make their bread mostly out of French Róles.
w these things, with others, M. SoYER has made known to the Times. To Mr. Punch alone ||
LORD ROBERT GROSWENOR'S
CANTICLE.
THE mansions of the just I’ll share,
Nor live where sinners dwell;
My heart delighteth in May-Fair,
But hateth Clerkenwell.
My house shall in Tyburnia be;
My home in Pimlico;
I i. not rest in Bermondsey,
Or sleep nigh Bunhill Row.
Mount Pleasant is a wicked place;
A naughty folk's abode.
And let me not, in any case,
Reside by Goswell Road.
But on Hay-Hill I will rejoice,
In Grosvenor Square the same :
The latter place give me, for choice,
By reason of the name.
Oh! come on Sunday from §. lanes,
And courts, º straying sheep;
And here behold what ". relgns,
And how we Sunday keep !
You’ll see no fish for sale, nor meat,
No public-houses here, .
Whence ragged girls, with slipshod feet,
Are ſetching pots of beer.
You’ll never, on that holy day,
Unhallow’d shoulders view,
Of mutton, brought from o'er the way,
Our blessed gates unto,
With baked potatoes under that,
Upon a tray of tin,
All smoking hot, and soak'd with fat,
But steep’d still more in sin.
No kind of work our servants do,
(For aught that you can see;)
That we are even such as you,
And eat and drink, deem ye P
Make others cook that we may dine P
That we can do such wrong?
So grossly break the law divine P
O misbelieving throng!
Though every day, on sumptuous fare,"
I feast, of all the seven;
And purple and fine linen wear,
I still may hope for heaven.
Because on Sunday my repast
. A righteous meal will be,
Sincefshall make the poor man fast,
And pray—perhaps 1-for me.
THE DANGERS OF THE THAMES.
WE read in the account of the Henley regatta,
that one of the boat races was “lost by Mis:
adventure, in consequence of MR., Lewis, of
Chelsea, having broken his scull.” This an-
nouncement is somewhat alarming, and indeed
it is rather unintelligible, for we do not see how
MR. Lewis can have caused the frightful fracture
which incapacitated him from further exertion;
though it is possible that he may have receive
from his competitor in the heat of the moment—
which appears to have been the Second Heat—an
injury of the kind described. We are great ad-
mirers of aquatic sports, and we have often
“pulled up * a cabman, which is no very easy or
agreeable task; but when we find we are liable
to have our scull, broken, we are almost deter:
mined to keep out of anything in the shape of
a row, or a rowing match as long as we live.
LORD PALMERSTON's Evil ExAMPLE.-There's
SoYER now—that other Minister of the Interior,

THE TWO SABBATHS.
Rich man's Sabbath is the easiest day of an easy seven;
On o springs and well-stuff'd cushions in its carriage goes, to
Caven.
If the road be steep and rugged, what are horses for? ºl
If the turnpike tolls be heavy, what then? His purse is full.
Poor man's Sabbath must be a work-day, his other six to suit:
If he must go to Heaven—let him find his way on foot.
Is he thirsty’. Close the taps; or Poor man will be boozing:
Is he footsore? Fence the turf; or Poor man will be snoozing.
Rich man's Sabbath takes its extra-hour of a downy bed:
Lingers o'er its breakfast: Can it pray, till it hath fed?
In trim garden, or snug parlour, wiles its time away, -
Till John brings the gilt prayer-books—and Rich man rides to pray.
Poor man's Sabbath stifles in its attic foul,
Visits its bare cupboard with a grumble and a growl.
Its children's hungry bellies with a cuff or crust assuages,
Then goes to Sunday market, with Saturday night's wages.
Rich man's Sabbath reads his Service, at a guinea, velvet-bound,
To match the velvet cushions of the snug pew, curtain’d round.
That if the parson droneth, Rich man at ease may snooze -
Out of the reach of nasty draughts, and envious free seats' views,
Poor man's Sabbath sitteth with its feet on the cold stones,
Rests on a hard and unback'd bench, as it may, its weary bones.
If it understand the parson or not is little odds,
Out of pulpit ear-shot are the seats, where Poor man's Sabbath nods.
Rich man's Sabbath has its club-house for needful sustentation,
Its Zoological Gardens for harmless recreation,
Its Ring to ride or drive in-hack-cabs are not admitted—
In short, let Rich man's Sabbath form a wish, and it is fitted.
Poor man's Sabbath if it will walk has the City streets to walk in:
Iſ it must have society, there's its own one room to talk in :
But it must not see Rich man's wild beasts, or smell rich man's sweet
flowers,
It will drink: but it gets no beer unless at legal hours.
Let Rich man make a Sabbath for Rich man: ’tis his due;
But why should he insist on making Poor man's Sabbath too?
There was Poor man once who said (he was under Rich man's ban),
“Man was not made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath made for man.”
Thus far I had written, balancing my lines with labour'd art, .
When ºlºs said—“Shame on you ! If you must write, write your
eart—
Pharisees! that with upturn'd eyes, clasp'd hands and saintly drone
See motes in your poor brother's eye—what beams are in your own?
Is this God's world or the devil's P Six days to Mammon given,
And one to make your souls in, and square accounts with Heaven?
In street and mart and senate is the devil free to perch—
And God Almighty shut within the four walls of your church?
You talk of Sabbath-breaking—for Sunday bills you seek
Is not. God's Sabbath broken every day of all the week?.
Live lives that prove you Christian, and I warrant you will prove
There is a power in godliness, words of truth and works of love.
Do jº, ...; ºt to make this world, what God meant this world
should be,
Look abroad and read what that is, in blossom, flower, and tree,
In the love as in the loveliness sown broad-cast over earth,
And for both within the heart of man a yearning and a dearth.
Find food for these: Lift piggish life out of the filthy stye, -
Where your yested rights have plunged it to struggle, curse and die.
Find a light for those dark places your lights can never reach:
Go to the Book, whose lesson men must live, or need not preach.
Feed the hungry: clothe the naked: teach the outcast : free the slave.
“This is my Sabbath,” saith the Lord, “the offering I crave.”
Is Heaven above our heads: Not so: God's kingdom is on earth:
All days are his, for rich and poor, that lie 'twixt death and birth.
Handsome Compliment.
“THE Old Woman who lived in a Shoe,” must have been a compli-
mentary allusion by one of our juvenile poets to MRs. GAMP, the Old
Woman, who still lives in Shoe Lane, º keeps up to the present day
the Morning IIerald, as a nursery of newspaper literature.
NELSON'S DAUGHTER AND GRANDCHILDREN.
AN advertisement in the Times tells the world, that the eight children
of Nelson's daughter HoRATIA—NELson's grandchildren—are “more
or less provided for.” Perhaps a little less than more; but let that
pass. At length a long, long standing debt has heen paid, or rather
compounded at something less than nineteen shillings in the pound.
The government, as the government, has done nothing. The stiff,
whalebone virtue that set up the back of QUEEN CHARLotte against
NELSON's daughter-George the THIRD thought NELson's funeral
had too much state in it for a mere subject; such pomp “was for kings”
—still kept the government aloof from all help of HoRºi, and her
children. At length, however, the press, spoke out. The “ribald
press” for a time laid aside its ribaldry, and condescended to champion
the claims of NEISON's daughter upon NELSON's fellow-countrymen.
Well, something has been done; and thus much in explanation we take
from the advertisement in question:-
“The eight children of HoRATIA, Mrs. WARD, are all now, more or less, provided
for. Her eldest son has been presented to the living of Radstock, by the Dowages
Countess of WAldegrave; the second son had been previously appointed by Sia
W. BURNETT Assistant-Surgeon in the Navy; to the third, Lord CHANCEllor CRAN-
worth has given a Clerkship in the Registry-Office; the fourth son received a Cadetcy
from CAPTAIN SHEPHERD; His Roy Al HighNEss PRINCE ALBERT conferred a similar
appointment on the youngest son; and HER MAJEsty has been graciously pleased to
settle upon the three daughters a pension of £300 per annum. To this last result the
exertions of the late MR. Humr, M.P., mainly contributed. MrssRs. GREEN. of Blackwall,
and Messas. SMITH, of Newcastle, conveyed the two Cadets to India free of expense.”
To this may be added “a small cash balance” paid to MRs. WARD,
“after investing £400 in the funds.” Altogether some £1,427 have been
subscribed in the cause of NELsoN's daughter. We state the sum, and
will not pause to calculate whether the amount be the tenth of a
farthing or even a whole farthing in the pound, for which England is
NELSON's debtor. Let us any way thank those who have helped
HoRATIA’s children. They have done well, from the l)owager-
Countess to the QUEEN, ending with the prince ship-owners of Black-
wall and Newcastle. Their ºft. will not have the worst fortune of
wreck or storm for having borne, passage-free, the grandsons of
NELsoN to their Indian work. Let us, too, pause to thank the shade
of Joseph HUME–the strong, sound, kind, old heart!—Joseph, who
“mainly contributed,” with those earnest, honest fingers of his to
undraw the royal purse-strings, so that, the three granddaughters may
now keep the wolf from the door, as their immortal grandfather kept
the foe from the “silver-girted isle.” -
Of course, from motives no doubt most delicate, most honourable,
and therefore to be most profoundly respected, the names of all the
helpers of HoRATIA and her children are not given. For we nowhere
see in the list the name of the present EARL of NELson, of the man
who is now a peer because a certain glorious sailor—son of a humble
Norfolk parson—bled out his life in the Wictory's cockpit. The living
peer lives a noble life, walks on velvet and sleeps on roses, the velvet
and flowers all, in some mysterious way, fashioned from the thunderbolts
cast about him by the DUKE or BRONTÉ. But then, of course, the
living EARL has made some ºf. rendered up something of the
wealth of which the first Parson Lord Nelson a little smugly fobbed
the naughty LADY HAMILTON. For somehow that EARL–can the
story be too often told? we think not—somehow he forgot to make
known NELsoN's codicil, fearing that the sum of £120,000, about to be
voted for the support of the new peerage, might be affected by the
publicity of the document. The codicil was waste paper, and the EARI,
of Nelson, with his thumb at his nose—for he was capable of the
gesture—showed LADY HAMILTON to the door; though when she died,
the Parson-peer anxiously crossed the sea to Calais in search of her
property, but only found the pawnbroker's duplicates.
§ there were some amends to be made for this; and of course
the present, EARL OF NELSON has made, all graceful reparation,
He has no doubt done good by stealth; and so stealthily that he will
never blush to find it fame.
Who shall Decide when Bishops Disagree ?
The Bishops met the other day in convocation, when the Bishop of
LoNDoN brought up a report which some of the other, Bishops declined
to swallow. The }. of St. Asaph “objected,” and the ARch-
Bishop of CANTERBURY said “the report was in direct opposition to
that agreed upon last July.” The proceedings then took a turn, whic
reminded one somewhat of an altercation about a game of billiards, for
the Bishop of Oxford defended the Bishop of LoNDON, on the ground
that he did not want to make a “Canon.”. The probability is that
several of the Bishops would readily forego the pleasure of “making a
canon; ” and that their game would rather be, to put something into
the pocket.

TWO SUNDAY TRAVELLERS.
SoME controversy has arisen as to the defi-
mition of a bond jide traveller travelling on a
Sunday. Qne kind of traveller, at any rate, has
a reasonable claim to that title—the person
who, being confined by business all the week,
travels on the Sunday for the sake of his health;
for such apersonnot only may, but ought to, take
that opportunity of exercise. But a question
which may also be mooted is, who is the
maláfide traveller on the day of rest? Surely, if
anybody is to be considered such, it is, he who
not only travels himself in his carriage, but also
compels men-servants to travel behind him, on
that solemn day, with their heads absurdly pow:
dered, and their persons prep serously attired
in coats and waistcoats º breeches of sky-blue
and crimson, drab and scarlet, or chocolate and
gamboge, causing them to exhibit a droll and
unseasonable resemblance to bullfinches, cock-
robins, and yellowhammers.

HOW TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN PRIVATE
T}ANKS.
Arrer the recent disgraceful smash of the Bank of PAUL, STRAHAN
and Co., .*.*. partner was remarkable for his seriousness, an
for his punctuality in taking the chair at pious meetings, it is quite
evident that the religious dodge will no longer serve the turn of com-
mercial swindlers. e are opposed to prejudice of all kinds; but we
are forced to admit, that we have long had an antipathy to men who
interlard their conversation with texts from Scripture, and sign their
letters “Yours in the true faith,” or with other cant phrases which
touch upon the borders of blasphemy. We once knew two serious
tailors who were brothers, and in partnership, but who had, not
spoken to each other for years, though they both went on talking about
“grace” and “works’ till they wound up their career in a Court of
Bankruptcy, when each proved the other a rogue to the satisfaction of
everybody.
The frightful collapse of religious cant, in the case of the banking:
house which has just broken down, will cause such a revulsion of
feeling against the mingling of the outward appearances of piety with
commercial concerns, that we should not be surprised if a private bank
were to introduce a “fast partner” for the purpose of inspiring the
confidence of the public. Instead of the º of the conventicle,
we may expect to hear a little, of the slang of the night-house,, from
behind a Banker's counter; and, indeed, it would be no bad speculation
to engage some great representative of the flash school, to deal with
those customers, whose suspicions will be aroused by anything in the
*:: of religious hypocrisy.
or the benefit of those firms, who would like to adopt our hint,
we ſurnish a few specimens of the mode in which the flash element
might be introduced into the ordinary transactions of a Banker's busi-
ness. The customer presents a cheque for payment, upon which the
fast partner exclaims, “Now, my rºr-r-r-rummy customer, how, will
ou have it, when will you have, where, will you have it?, Will you
e it in himsies, or will you have it all in tin? Come—look sharp,
my downy one, and fºll fork out the brads like bricksey wicksey.”
An individual presents himself at the counter with some money to be
laced to his account, when the fast partner, or the flash clerk greets
im somewhat in the following fashion. “Come along, come along,
come along ! Is your money safe with us thinks you? I believe you
my boy! says I. There! Nix my º: draw away. Are your
securities safe? to be sure they are. Right as a trivet. (Sings.)—
“In the box of a stone jug they are born.”
Would you like to see them? No you won't, won't you? (Sings.)-
* If I had a customer vot wouldn't go-
To see his securities down below,
I'd say—"
“No never mind what I’d say, for as you don't want to look at them,
why then. (swo-. Down among the dead men,

TRIAL IN THE COURT OF HYMEN.
DEscRIBING a “Marriage in High Life,” our fashionable contem-
porary says–
“The mother of the bride was unequal to the trial, which her presence at the church

Trial! What trial? Surely there was no bigamy in the case; and if
there had been, the offence was not one to which the laty, by her
attendance at the nuptials, would have subjected herself to iſ tidiment
for being an accessory.

A SPOKE IN THE COMMON WHEEL.
WHAT is to be done to cut down the length of the Parliamentary
debates? Everybody admits that talking is the great obstruction, to
legislation, and everybody feels that it is of no use talking, for it is
quite impossible to talk the Members out of their propensity to lon
harangues. It would be worth almost any money if a º di
be made, by which to induce Parliament to hold its tongue. any of
the talkers are looked upon as nothing better than long-winded pumps,
the effect of which would be invaluable if the º could be got to
act as air-pumps upon one another, and mutually exhaust each other
as well as themselves. The vehicle of legislation is brought to a de
standstill, because MR. So-AND-So's ſlatulence stops the way. The
other evening an honourable Member began by declaring, that “it was
with uns able anxiety he rose,” and he went on speaking his
unspeakabilities for near an hour and a half. -
Speech is said to have been given to man to conceal his thoughts, but
Parliamentary speech seems to have been given to some men, to expose
their thoughtlessness; for if they considered for a moment, they would
never allow their love of talking to put an end to all legislative action.
In matters of ordinary business it is considered a sound principle that
a thing should be no sooner said than done, but in the House of
Commons a thing is no sooner said, than it is tolerably sure not to be
done till a year at least from the date at which it was spoken of.

SABBATH-BREAKING AND SWEARING.
Swearing is now not only unfashionable, but both unusual and
vulgar. An oath is rarely uttered by an individual of the first or
Second Class, even when the Collector calls for the Income-Tax. Yet
many persons now living can recollect the time, when almost every man,
except a clergyman or a dissenter, was accustomed to mingle his dis-
course with imprecations. At present scarcely anybody whatever in a
black coat, or a coat of any other cloth of a woollen, texture, and
ordinary boots, is in the habit of cursing and using bad language.
That habit is nearly confined to the wearers of fustian and velveteen
jackets, smockfrocks, nailed highlows, and ankle-jacks. In passing a
group of these Third Class people at the corner of a street you too
often hear one or more of them pronounce words, which cannot be
uoted. . Now the pronunciation of these words is unnecessary on
the speaker's part, offensive as regards yourself, and revolting con-
sidered in relation to hearers of a tender age or gentle sex. Nobody
doubts the wickedness of this abuse of speech; though a few may
possibly question whether the First Day of the week is the Seventh.
If, therefore, Lorp Robert GRosvenon, Lord EBRINGTON, MR.
Wilson PATTEN, and the other Sabbatarians, º: in pressing or
maintaining their Coercion Bills for obliging the common Fº to
observe Sunday by fasting and abstinence, it may be expected that one
or more of them will call upon the House of Commons to take some
steps to prevent swearing in the streets. -
º there exists a law which renders any person guilty of swear-
ing liable to be apprehended by a policeman, taken before a magistrate
and fined 5s. per profane, oath. This law has been lying dormant all
that time during which the practice of indulging in execrations has
been on the decline. - -
Will LoRD Robert GRosvºson and his holy friends let the decline
of bad ºf; go on, or will they create a reaction in favour of
blasphemy and foul-speaking by reviving the statute against swearing
with additional penalties, and with provisions for being duly enforced?
If they do, of course these polite persons will take care that the act
shall apply only to the unfashionable streets and places of public resort,
lest the punishment designed to º the Whitechapel costermonger
from addressing his donkey sinfully, shall alight on the gentleman using
a casual expression of a similar quality in Bond Street.
It will then be for the House to consider, whether any person, who
can speak good English, habitually employs, improper expressions; and
whether the swearing which the Saints unite to *: would not be
most effectually put down by the education which the disunited Saints
render impossible. - -
At the same time, perhaps, Parliament will be pleased to inquire,
whether the most promising way of getting the people to observé
Sunday as the Hebrews observe Saturday, is not to provide them with
adequate spiritual instruction—that is to say, with a simple index to
those texts which enjoin that observance.

o I went into the great palace of INK, in the which did live all
manners of what some did call diaboli imprimatorum, the which did
work all day and all night, ever relieving each other, as they did com-
pose, set up, correct, return for revise, correct again, break up, work,
machine, stereotype, work off, turn over at case, distribute, and the
like, certain curious bits of lead, zinc, brass, copper, and the like, and
did swallow up whole magazines of sheets of paper, whole heaps. of
copy, whole viº of punctuation, insomuch that notes of interrºgation
came to an end, exclamations of indignation fell short, and all they
could find were full stops about the great war and the Łords, and the
geese which were in want of bridles. Qver the which did rule, the

the said BRIDLeGoose did introduce to us, right courteously, his trusty
Secretary, DontcARE, and he did yet more courteously present to us a
very big, huge, ponderous, and right well written volume of prognostics,
upon the which we did feed, and continue to feed º well.
And as he that eateth to repletion lacketh not for food, even as he
that hath more than enough hath what he may well spare, so it irks and
ill becomes me that I pour not forth from the plenitude of the #

humana of the proprietary emits very objectionable noises.
MR. Best, who has been º as organist, and who has certainly
made the organ discourse most eloquent music, complains of having
been treated, by those who engaged his services, as an artist ought not
to be treated; and the first time the owners of the instrument send
their bellows to mend, they had better send their mannerstoundergo a
similar reparatory operation.
Not satisfied with MR. BEST’s scholarly exhibition of the varied
powers of the grand or by the performance of a series of compo-
sitions to visitors who listen, the directors of the establishment call
upon a gentleman and a musician to “play the people out.” He is to
accompany the shuffling of feet, the racing down stairs, the calls of
|parties to “keep together,” the requests “not to shove,” the squabble
or canes, parasols, and umbrellas, and the recitative in which cabs are
summoned to the door. . And when the last lounger is out, the gentle.
man and musician may leave off. But this is not all. The direction
is good enough to select a composition fit to be applied to this noble
art-purpose—and they select MENDELssohn’s “Bridal Chorus,” which,
as everybody knows, is just the thing to be trampled to pieces by a
crowd of wearied sight-seers, anxious to escape. If the directors
could get a RAPHAEL, they would, in the same spirit, lay it down as a
door-mat, for the greater luxury of their departing patrons.
MR., Best, having in vain remonstrated against the vulgarity, very
properly resigns. He will not desecrate MENDELssohn, and “play the
people out.” If the Panopticon people conduct all their arrangements
in this fashion, and without regard to what is due to art, the public,
which soon comprehends such things, will discover it. And then the
next organist will have a very much harder task to attempt than
“playing people out,” namely, that of “playing them in.” The
directors have got a Novum Organum, and a noble one, but they need
not therefore behave like fat Bacons.
The Bitters of Repentance.
THESE Bitters are taken generally the first thing in the morning
when a fast young gent(lºman) wakes up with a bitter headache, an
before he can eat his breakfast has to fly to gentian, quinine, absinthe,
and such like bitters, or else rushes frantically into Bitter Beer. An
“embittered existence” means the life that is eventually led by one
#: Any length of time, has been in the habit of taking the above
“bitters.

PROPOSED NEW UNIFORM FOR THE POLICE,
WITB. LETTERS AND numbers PROPERLY MARKED.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ONE graceful duty has been done, not ungracefully, by Parliament
this week. In compliance with an invitation from the Črown, provision
has been made for testifying the national sense of the character and
services of the noble soldier who has died at the head of the English
army in the Crimea.
“Ornantes supremo funus honore.”
July 2nd, Monday. LoRD ST. LEoNARD's called the attention of the
Lords to the Ticket of Leave System, which he described as havin
worked very badly. LoRD GRANville, in reply, said that it ha
worked very well. LoRD MELVILLE and the Duke of CAMBRIpgE
expressed great anxiety that none of the Ticket of Leave Men should be
allowed to enter the military service, which was a profession of honour.
There is much to be said, of course, both ways, but there might be a
worse recruit than a reprieved Burglar, who would break into Sebas-
to * or a reprieved Smasher, who should take to smashing its
enders.
In the House of Commons, the Sabbatical homoeopathist, LoRD
Robert Ghosvenor, manifested an infinitesimal quantity of sense, by
withdrawing the Sunday Trading Bill, as reluctantly, however, as if he
were a martyr making a sacrifice, instead of a muff retracting a blunder.
It is difficult to say, who has behaved worst in connection with this bill;
the silly Lord, who brought it in ; the timid Government, that was afraid
to take one side or the other; the apathetic House of Commons, that did
not thrust the bill from the threshold, which would have been (Mr.
Punch mentions for the benefit of certain ignorant writers for the
Sunday press) to Eliminate it; the unfaithful metropolitan members, who
did not whip up the said House to its work; or the police, who instead of
battering the swell-mob and the stone-throwers, brutally beatinoffensive
persons, children, and cripples. The whole business is especially dis-
creditable, but the lesson may not prove useless, if it teach, the Sab-
batarians, that they are not to begin religious teaching at the wrong
end. You can and may “make people religious by Acts of Parliament,”
and Mr. Punch hopes to see the process carried out with, the utmost
vigour, but the Acts will not deprive poor people of their Sunday
dinner. A set of Six Acts, providing the means of ordinary cleanliness,
Fº that in poor homes tenants' º shall not be sacrificed to
andlords’ Avarice, providing cheap and wholesome education for the
child, º: for the punishment of the parent who withholds it, pro-
viding holidays, and places where such days may be rationally, yes, and
comfortably spent, providing that Wages shall be paid twenty-four
hours before the Day of Rest—that Sestett of Acts would go a very
long way towards making people religious by Act of Parliament—the
rather that such legislation would bring us up to a point at which the
Fº Teacher of Religion could address the people, and feel that
was not mocking the victims of dirt, ..". ignorance and misery,
by calling on them to be decorous devotional. Interim, be it
WOL. XXIX.
C
said, that Mr. Punch accepts with pleasure, but without the faintest
blush on his fine, countenance, the snow-storm of acknowledgments he
sº for his noble and philanthropic conduct in defeating the
unday Bill.
The Educational prospects of the country, however, are not very
brilliant. On this Monday night, the Scottish Education Bill made
some little, progress, and the Senators, deeply impressed with the
serious business on which they were engaged, roared and roared again
with laughter, because on one of the amendments the members were
equal; but SIR John PAKINGTON had to throw over his English bill, in
despair of getting attention for it this Session. However, Loºp John
Russell consoled him by promising, that the subject of Education
should not entirely escape the consideration of Government. And
thereupon the three bills, with which Parliament has been playing,
namely, two Education Bills and a Free School Bill—were pitched out
of the House. Gaols, it would seem, are cheaper than Schools.
Tuesday. Both Houses were occupied in the way mentioned in Mr.
Punch's first paragraph. SHAKSPEARE felt that the effect of the most
solemn business was heightened by the artistic introduction of a bit of
contrasting chatter and absurdity, and MR. MILNER GIBson, recog-
nising this truth in art, broke into the homage which the Commons
were rendering to a departed hero, with some petulant peace-monger's
trash, for which he received a stinging rebuke from Lord PALMERston
who was probably not aware of the º art of the interruption, and
only saw in it a piece of low taste. Finally, MR. Rich (MR. HENRY
DRUMMOND's little, pig that squeaked because, unable to get at the
conduit of natural diet), endeavouring to set forth certain motions about
the army, was cruelly counted out, about dinner time.
Wednesday. The Commons got through some work without much
unnecessary talking, and especially made progress with a useful Coal
Mines Inspection # It seems necessary that there should be very
stringent control, by disinterested persons, over mines; and as minors
are entitled to necessaries, it is to be hoped the bill will pass.
Thursday. It would, of course, be too much to expect, that our
Government, or the War-Minister, should be able to do a º: thing
properly, or without ºf attempts, and alterations. LoRD PAN.
MURE announced, that, he had reconsidered his plan for giving our
soldier double pay, and investing half in the Savings Bank, and that
he should pay him sixpence extra, as field allowance, and enable him to
appropriate another sixpence for the benefit, of his family. LoRD
ELLENBoRough stated, that he was doing all in his power as a recruiting
serjeant, for whenever he met a man who looked as if he wanted advice,
his Lordship told him, “to discard all worldly considerations and to
become a soldier, for the first of all professions was the military pro-
fession, and the first of all rewards was military honour.” It was re-
marked that the Bishops and Law Lords cheered this announcement
with almost unseemly vociferation. -
The Commons went at the Nuisances Bill, and LQRD Robert GRos-
vENor actually had the egotism to speak on the subject. As a fitting
chastisement for his personal vanity, the Hyde Park affair came up
again, and MR. Tom DunconſBE brought forward a number of instances
of the misconduct of the police, nearly all of which SIR GEORGE GREY
refused to believe. The Tenants Compensation Bill, an Irish measure,
was then discussed, the debate being only remarkable for the coarse
language used by the majority of the Irish Members who spoke.
Their provincial petulance and arrogance at last drew from LoRD PAL-
MERston a damaging castigation, which, by way of example, he laid
across the shoulders of their grumbling Coryphoeus, SHEE, an Irish
lawyer of much vulgar volubility. The PREMIER told this SHEE, that
|he had begged the Government to take charge of the bill, but was doing
all he could to impede its passing, in order to maintain a grievance
which would be a good hustings’ cry. The House, perfectly under-
standing that this really was the Irish game, applauded the exposure,
which so enraged SHEE, that he poured out a whole flood of Billingsgate,
and then defied Lord PALMERston to rebuke º To this Lord
PALMERston quietly observed, that he “certainly would be guilty
of that presumption whenever he thought proper.” Punch has had to
touch up his friend PAM on occasion, but never denied him the credit
of having inherited from their mutual and lamented friend (whose son
is just going to India in the office his father should have lived to retain)
the art of dealing most efficiently with the “Yelpers.”
There was then a renewal of a discussion, whether Members ought to
vote on questions without having been in the House—a mode of taking
things easy, which the ATToRNEY-GENERAL and others seemed to have
been practising. The SPEAKER thought that they really ought not.
Friday. The Lords discussed Lord DERby's plan, for preventing
family prayers. LoRD SHAFTESBURY opposed it, and the ARchbishop
of CANTERBURY, thinking that things are best as they are (a way of
thinking popular with ARchbishops of CANTERBURY), also objected to
it. The §". therefore withdrawn. One can understand the noble
Racer DeRBy’s objection to seeing a Horse upon his knees, but cannot
exactly comprehend his having a similar objection in the case of a
Christian.
In the Commons a pledge was extorted from SIR. GeoRGE GREY, that
he would institute a bond ſide investigation into the conduct of the
No. 731.

police in the Park, on the previous Sunday. ..In answer to the inti-
mation that there was a probability of another disturbance on the
following Sunday, a gentleman whose name, Mr. Punch being merciful,
would suppress (only remarking that it sounds, very like GEORGE
UNN’d Ass), suggested the very, strong antidote of Sir-Pounders.
He, however, afterwards qualified this suggestion, by saying he only
meant that he hoped Government would take every necessary pre-
caution. Mr. Punch owns to blind, nay, abject devotion to the
aristocracy, both heraldic and pecuniary, but he is bound to say, that
he would almost sooner see one of those dear old wrinkled, painted,
wigged hags of dowagers sent away from the Park gate, with her car-
riages, flunkeys, lapdogs, prayer-books, toadies, and all, than that her
distinguished presence should occasion the spilling of plebeian blood,
This may be a republican sentiment; but Mr. Punch's tried loyalty, and
the confidence placed in him by his Sovereign, permit him to say bold
things, from which the herd would shrink. .
By way of closing the week in a dignified manner, LORD JoHN
RUssell let out that he came home from Vienna with certain Austrian
propositions for peace, which he and M. DROUYN DE LHUys thought
the Allies ought to accept. The Governments of England and France
thought otherwise, so the Frenchman, having a nice sense of honour,
resigned; but LoñD JoHN, being a little tougher, stayed in, and to
make all safe, roared for war like a good one. Now that the war is not
going on prosperously, he reveals all this, being aremarkable nice little
man for a small Cabinet party.

THE most remarkable of Cooks' º: is the voyage made to the
Crimea by Soyer, the ex-cook of the Reform Club. His object is to
apply the culinary, art to the provisions of war, and to enable the
soldiers to deal with their rations in a rational manner. According to
his own account his success has been considerable, and he has planted
in the hospitals of Scutari several cooks, each of whom is sufficiently a
hero to enable him to deal with a batterie (de cuisine), and to face the
most tremendous fire.

CHAIR 1 CHAIR 1
THE following remarkable notice has been placed in our hands:-
ROYAL
BOTANIC SOCIETY OF LONDON.
NOTICE.
Numerous complaints having been made to the Council, it is requested
that no Lady or Gentleman occupy more than one CHAIR at a time.
By Order of the Council,
J. DE C. SOWERBY,
June 9th, 1855. Secretary.
We do not quite comprehend the connection between Chairs and
Botany, nor do we see why complaints of the occupation of “more than
one chair at a time,” should be forwarded to the Council of the Botanic
Society. We have seen members of clubs occasionally occupying more
than one chair, and we have sometimes been desirous of giving them a
good setting down, by drawing one chair from under them, and thus
exemplifying the truth, that “between two stools it is possible to fall
to the ground.” Perhaps the chairs alluded to in the above notice are
Garden-chairs, and if more than one of these should be ºl. by
a single individual, it is quite natural that the Council should issue a
standing order for the purpose of appropriating the seats in fair propor-
tions among the company. We think if any one presumes to put
his leg on a chair, the member should be at once unseated in a summary
Inanner.
NEW SHAKSPERIAN POINTS.
WHILE SHAKSPEARE can hardly get a hearing in London, (except
when misquoted in the House of Commons), it is gratifying to find
that artist-minds in the provinces are devoted to the eliciting new
“points” out of his conceptions. Mr. Punch had the pleasure of
reading, a few days , a notice of a performance, at Shrewsbury, of
the Merchant of Wenice. The critic, (** admiration for the poet
renders, him honourably unmindful of the humility of the theatre
where the immortal play is presented) civilly hints to the principal actor
as followeth:— -
“We would recommend him, the next time he essays Shylock, not to be so pugna.
cious, when making his final exit, as to strike Gratiano in the bowels. Shylock is not a
Clown, nor is Gratiano a Pantaloon. The Jew is a fº. and we may add, that it
Il
is not very likely he would commit an assault a Court of Justice, or add to the
indignity by spitting on histormentor.”
Generally agreeing in the spirit of this censure, we think that the
detail is open to argument. In criticising a great character, you must
do so both analogically and synthetically. It is true that in regard to
this particular mode of castigating Gratiano, SHAKSPEARE has not left
a stage direction; but in Act I., Scene 3, we find Shylock expressing a
wish to “catch Antonio on the hip.” Now it is not unnatural to sup-
pose that a malignant person, who, in cold blood, would catch Antonio on
the hip, would, when heated into wrath, catch Antonio's friend awunner
in the quarter indicated. That he should hit Gratiano instead of his
friend Antonio, is a still more delicate Shaksperian subtlety, the whole
#. ºming upon the sufferings a friend undergoes for the sake of his
riend.
ln reference to the expectorating point, we confess to a greater
difficulty, but consideration only shows how deeply the actor in question
has studied his author. In the scene to which we have already re-
ferred, Shylock reminds Antonio that the latter had spit upon him on
the previous Wednesday. Now, as retaliation is the key to Shylock's
character, we think that the idea of concluding his career by returnin
the Christian insult, is an inspiration as well as an expectoration, an
does the utmost honour to the artist whose conception it is. In con-
clusion, we are heartily glad to find that Shrewsbury clock keeps such
true Shaksperian time.
Giving the Government Warming.
RED has always been a revolutionary colour; and we begin to suspect
now, from what we have lately seen, that the Bonnet Rouge must have
been bound round originally, with Red Tape, and it was the fact of this
Red Tape pressing so heavily upon the heads of the people that drove
them first to Revolution. The pressure was more than they could bear,
and so they burst the Government bonds. We leave the warning to
the reflection of our sagacious rulers.

THE SIX-POUNDER FOR LINLITHGOWSHIRE.
R. GEORGE DUNDAs
has favoured the
Home Secretary with
is very peculiar ad-
vice for the further
treatment of the
people-many of them
“rascally boys’” —
who meetin the Park.
Sweet to the length-
ened ears of the hon.

six-pounder.” Thus
spoke the wisdom
of the parliamentary
drum-head Of
course, when the
atrocity of the sug-
estion had been
oudly condemned by
the English gentle-
men of the House
of Commons, MR.
DUNDAs declared that really, he had meant nothing. His “six-pounder” was a figure
of speech—its powder and shot, a flash in the pan and sugar-plums. We trust,
however, when DUNDAs the Six-pounder shall again present itself for re-election,
that the constituency of Linlithgowshire will duly spike the same.
IT WILL NEWER ANSWER.
We should like to know, how many persons now living and poo-poohing, with-
out knowing anything about, the plan of LoRD DUNDoNALD, can recollect i.
* under similar circumstances, in the same manner, with regard to gas an
steam
It is probable, however, that not one of them remembers, or can recall to
mind, the utterance of any such folly; Nature having bountifully provided for his
oblivion thereof, in order that the street lamps might not dazzle, and the loco-
motives might not hiss him into madness with disgust with himself for having
spoken like a fool. Photography would have afforded a rare subject of ridicule to
these wise men: but it became a success almost before they had time to predict that
it would prove a failure. -
LoRD DUNDoNALD's invention may be a mistake; but it may possibly, at least
be a fact, and no mistake. Were it ever so much an unmistaken fact, would
not every Ministry that ever governed this country, including the present, have
resisted, nevertheless, and continue to resist, its adoption, as long as they had the
shadow of an excuse for their opposition, and a considerable time after even that
had vanished. If the surest device for blowing up St. Petersburg were to be dis-
covered to-morrow, Downing Street, and the Horse Guards, and the Admiralty,
would unite in swearing, probably in a profane manner, that it never would blow
up St. Petersburg, precisely as they, º perhaps in several instances, swore
that gas would blow up London—an exploded motion, simply, on the part of the
sharp fellows of the period. -
Talk of ABELLARD and HELoise!—was there ever constancy like that of the
Veterans to Brown Bess? -
Unjust people—who are numerous-mistrust the good faith of other people.
Persons who are conceited as well, question the understanding of others also. They
try all, questions, by their private feelings; their self-esteem doubts or disbelieves
everything in advance of their own ideas, and their selfish cunning feels that it
is safer for men of the world to run the greatest risk of opposing a truth on the
shrewd side, than to entertain the least question of what may turn out a fallacy on
that of the credulous. We should certainly like to know, what LoRD DUNDoNALD’s
plan is, before we unite with these gentlemen of “common sense,” in sneering at an
invention which is capable of destroying Cronstadt for aught they can show—
beyond their intuitive contempt.
A NEW BRUSSELLS SPROUT.
THE new Sprout, which has just made its appearance at Brussells, is of the very
greenest kind, with not the least heart in it, and leaves so dirty that the hungriest
pig would infallibly turn his nose up at them. What little taste it has is of the
most offensive kind, and persons experience the Fº difficulty in swallowing
it, though it is generally served up with º of Russian sauce, to make it go
down. It is strange that Leopold, who, by right of his Claremont Estate, and its
well º: kitchen-garden, is the recognised Monarch of the Vegetable Kingdom,
should allow such a very poor specimen of green-stuff to sprout in his capital.
The name of this new Brussells Sprout, we must, not forget to state, is Le Nord;
though it matters but little what it has been called, for fortunately it does not grow
very fast in º; estimation, and must soon be extinct, as it has taken no root
whatever in the soil of journalism,

Of Hampstead shall resort with vain demands;

Or that quite insulated isle, Eel-pie.

. It is scarcely necessary to state, that we take the following adver:
tisement from the second column of the Times. The sceptical may find
it by referring to the paper of the 16th instant.
To H.S., FROM THE CRIMEA. The BOX was RECEIVED by the
telegraph.
If the advertiser will apply to the Society of Arts, it is possible he
may hear of something to his advantage. The quick transmission of
packages may be counted with the chief desiderata of the age, and here
we find a person publicly announcing, that he has had one sent by
telegraph' it is scarcely clear, from the wording of his statement,
whether the box was received “from the Crimea:” but in making so
extraordinary a revelation a little indistinctness is both natural and
pardonable. The mere fact of a box having been sent by telegraph at
all is surely quite enough to startle the scientific world, and we there-
fore leave our savants to confer with the advertiser, and make the
most they can of his discovery.
Justice at the Footlights.
PUNCH is happy to state, that the example of MR. BUCKSTONE, of the
Haymarket Theatre, who has liberally revived the old custom of an
“Author's Night.” (a night when a drama is performed for the benefit
of the person who invented it) is about to be imitated by all his brother
Managers...They are going to give N º: to their Authors, and by
way of making their generosity gracefully complete, French steamers
have been chartered to bring over the benéficiares.
“A LITTLE WHITE FLAG.”
IT was to be expected that the Russian officer in command at Hango
would justify the murder and capture of the men of the Cossack. There:
fore, the Russian Government is assured that the Flag of Truce hoisted
on the occasion was “only a little white flag on a stick.” Well, it was
a white flag: even the Russian officer does not deny that fact. The
question would seem to be, in the Russian mind, the dimensions of a
Flag of Truce. How many yards of white bunting or linen constitute
the sanctity of such a flag?... “The crew of LIEUTENANT GENESTE's
boat”—says the Russian poltroon—“was caught in their own trap.”
Since the wolf in the fable devoured the lamb for muddying the
stream, there has never been put forth so atrocious, an excuse for
atrocity committed, as by this Russian bear in command at Hango.
A Fruity Joke.
THE following Joke, which has been bottled up for an entire week,
may be pronounced on the whole rather fruity:-
An amateur of music (who is also a wag) remarked the other day,
with reference to some strawberries on the table, “that he (the wag)
would enjoy a pottle of strawberries all to himself, inasmuch as it
would be a musical as well as a festive treat, for it would in fact be a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A MODEST YOUNG GENTLEMAN.
UNCH considers that the fol-
lowing advertisement offers
an eligible opportunity to
such young ladies of ample
means, engaging appear-
ance, and . education,
as may find themselves left
on hand with the damaged
muslins and faded bonnets
at the fag end of the
season:- ,
ATRIMONY.—AYoung
Gentleman, studying for
one of the Professions, but whose
limited means prevent him from
completing, except in a tedious
and unsatisfactory manner, is de-
sirous of meeting with a Young
Lady of some fortune, a moderate
share of good looks, well educa-
ted, and in every respect fitted to
become a good and affectionate
partner. References will be ex-
changed, and all information
communicated to bond fide parties,
by addressing free, to No. 268,
N.B.A.O., Edinburgh.
Many men, look to mar-
riage, we all know, as a
means of support; but it is
beginning rather early to
advertise for a wife, for the purpose of appropriating her fortune to
the prosecution of professional studies. We shall not be surprised to
find the principle carried still further out; and we may expect,to meet
with an advertisement from some still younger gentlemán, than the
young one mentioned above, who may be in want of a wife to pay his
school bills, or send him to Eton or Westminster. As these young
persons may be unable to frame a paragraph for themselves, we suggest
the following as a model:
ATRIMONY AND SCHOOLING.—A very young Gentleman, who
is at present attending a Sunday School, but who would prefer going to Eton with
a view to the University and the Church or the Bar; but whose means, derived from
his father's fishstall, prevent him from carrying out his views, or indeed from carrying
out anything, but shrimps and periwinkles, is desirous of meeting with a Young Lºy
of good fortune, good looks, and good education, with a view to making her his wife,
subject to his refusal of her at a fitting time, when in the absence of a more eligible
candidate she will have the preference. References, and indeed anything the young
lady happens to possess, will be exchanged, and other information may be obtained at
the crossing at the bottom of the Haymarket, where several young gentlemen are
in attendance, but where the Advertiser will reverse his broom as a signal to any young
lady who flourishes her pocket handkerchief. N.B. No old Maid need apply,
A CARD.
MR. Pynch presents his compliments to MR. TITE, M.P., and begs
to lay before him a practical plan of Administrative Reform. Mr. Punth
proposes, that a certain sum, say a million, or a million, and a half,
should be set aside annually, for the purpose of establishing sinecure
places, varying in value from 100l. to 1000l. a year, or upwards., . He
also proposes, that the patronage of these sinecure offices should be
vested in Whig noblemen, the Aristocracy in general, and, in fact, all the
most distinguished jobbers in the country. . As a slight return
Mr. Punch respectfully hopes that the holders of these sinecures and
their patrons will refrain from thrusting their dirty fingers into the
eat national pie, but will rest satisfied with what they have got, and
et the Army - - -
is constrained to avow, that his former opinions with respect to Sine-
cures were erroneous, recent events having proved what a safety-valve
to jobbery sinecures have ever been.
Selfish Exultation.

JACK AND LADY NANCY,
A WULGAR SONG BY A COMMON SEAMAn.
The Lady Nancy was knocked together in a night, the Stromboli towed her a

burned Taganrog.—See the Times, July 2nd.
OJAw till you’re frantic of wessels gigantic
With hundreds of guns and with t Susands of Crew,
JACK's want’s of the oddest, a wessel so modest
As just does the work as he wants her to do.
He doesn’t condemn none, your big Agamemnon,
Your Dukes and your Alberts, as long as a street;
They’re mighty, imposing, but when he’s for closing,
A taught Lady Nancy is worth the whole fleet.
She aint no great sight for the lubbers wot write,
She aint no. “Sea-Castle wot frowns on the brine,”
It might be like flattery to praise her “black battery,”
Orchristen her “Majesty's symbol and sign: ”
She doesn't come “looming” like one as “speaks dooming,”
To "crush into atoms each foe she may meet,”
But if foes you’d be beating as won't give the meeting,
Our taught Lady Nancy is worth the whole fleet.

No Miss in white flouncing her name were announcing,
As Nancy splash'd down to “her home on the main.”

And as for your gun-boats, (as some folks calls bomb-boats,)
Wot use is inwentions as draws all them feet?
For cannons and mortars wot dances the waters,
Our taught Lady Nancy is worth the whole fleet.
We know’d wot we wanted, materials was granted,
We knock'd her together as quick as we could,

And there’s werry fine ashes where Taganrog stood.

That more towns of old Bruin's would now be in ruins,
If you'd more Lady Hens in HER MAJESTY's fleet.
A pHOPOSAL TO LORD DUNDONALD.
MY DEAR LORD DUNDONALD,
. I HAVE read all your letters on the subject of your plan for
making short work of this horrible war with the greatest interest. The
following passage occurs in your last, with reference to LoRD PAL-
MERSTON's redtapeism of calling that plan a “scheme,” and stating
that the Government were not “prepared” to carry it into execution:-
*But I protest against the term scheme being substituted for plan, as a misrepresen-
tation of facts, which, if divulged, would admit of no doubt, and which would be
divulged in my own justification, were not such a course manifestly objectionable,
whilst our Government entertain the resolution not to avail themselves of means the
most speedy and effective in the prosecution of war.”
...Are you quite sure, my dear Lord, that it would be objectionable to
divulge the facts to which your Lordship alludes? The question is,
whether, in case your plan were divulged, and its practicability were
self-evident, the Government would yield to public opinion and adopt
it, º the Russians could jump at it, and blow us all out of the
Water
Would your Lordship have any objection to explain your plan to a
commission of scientific men, with whose report, on it the country
would be satisfied, in case I, or the Proprietary of any other leading
!al, should endeavour to supply the deficiency of Government by
constituting and appointing a body of engineers, chemists, and others,
possessing acknowledged and recognised ability to pronounce upon the
subject f 33th flºº.
A SHORT CUT TO METAPHYSICS,
WHAT is Matter?—Never mind.
What is Mind?—No matter.

PUNCH's ILLUSTRATIONS TO SHAKSPEARE,
“I have seen the ambitious Ocean swell.”
Julius Cæsar, Act i., Scene 3.
CRUEL ASSAULT ON A WERY OLD GENTLEMAN.
YESTERDAY, Richard Spoon ER—who gave his addresses 9, Man-
chester-buildings, Carlton Club, and Birmingham—was charged at
Bow-street with a series of cruel attacks upon an extremely ancient
and venerably green old gentleman, who gave his name—CHRONos;
vulgarly known as QLD TIME., The accused refused all legal assist-
ance, although his friends had, in the kindest manner, ensured the
valuable services of MR. PARRY. -
PUBLIC OPINION said, that he appeared with
the prisoner, a person who had certainly moved—no, he could not say
moved, for move, at least forward, he would not, but who stood still-
in a respectable circle of society; but there were human interests call-
ing for protection, and, however painful to himself, he must press the
charge against the prisoner, whose repeated attacks ". MR. Chronos,
otherwise, OLD TIME, had of late become past all human endurance.
It was not to be thought of, that so respectable an individual as OLD
TIME-a person so valuable, nay, so vital to the interests of society—
should be left at the mercy of the prisoner, especially as the offender
had so frequently shown himself incapable of any consideration of the
venerable complainant. -
MR. CHRONos, allas, OLD TIME, here stood forward. He said that,
for many, many years he had been more or less abused in public by the
prisoner. Of ſº however, the conduct of the prisoner had become
ou us. . The complainant said, he should not so much mind being
killed outright. There were, he knew, thousands of well-to-do people
of both sexes in London who had no other thought than to kill him, to
Nº. end they so often fired at him, though in vain, with gold and silver
ets
(here the venerable witness became a little excite )—and by Styx he
would not stand it!
Here the prisoner, with the coolest and most confident air, begged to
call the attention of the Magistrate to the conduct of the witness. , He
had sworn, and swearing was fineable. ...The prisoner (who had no
other motive, he said, than that of §: morality) hoped that his
worship would nflict the fine of five shillings.
MAGISTRATE to Complainant. Proceed with your statement. I would
i. pain against
—but to be droned, mumbled to death, was past all bearing, and
further advise the prisoner to keep quiet, and not to shake his fist at
!. witness. By such conduct the prisoner will certainly not benefit
is case.
Old TIME proceeded. He had long put up with the ill-conduct of the
§."; but of late the persecution had been intolerable. Here MR.
LD TIME showed an hour-glass, and observed that in consequence of
the wishy-washy sentences of the prisoner, with his drizzling showers of
words, the sand in the hour-glass had become so damp and clogged
together, that, let the glass be shaken as it might, the sand would not
run sparklingly, as was its wont in a fine, dry, sunny atmosphere. The
witness further exhibited a scythe'; and called the attention of the
worthy magistrate to the jagged condition of its edge. “Yes, your
worship,” said TIME, with some emotion, “it was in general as nice
and keen a blade as any man might mow seconds, minutes, hours, days,
and years with-light grass and heavy—and now look at it. The
risoner at the bar has absolutely talked all these notches in it. And
he will do it, and while he goes on talking, you can't think how tough
a job he makes it to get through an hour or two.”
MAGISTRATE. Have you any further complaint against the prisoner?
QLD TIME. Why, yes, your worship, I should think I h Twice
within this last fortnight has the Fº at the bar beat me so cruelly
about the skull with an Irish shillelah, a weapon loaded with lead, and
cut from the groves, not of Blarney, but of Maynooth, that I know not
whether I’m on my head or º heels. What’s more, the prisoner
isn't content to ill-use me himself, but he sets on a score more folks
to clog up my sand and notch my scythe.
. The worthy Magistrate asked the prisoner, what he had to say in
his defence? -
| The prisoner began in his old strain, when—.
TIME, whipping up his hour-glass, and taking his scythe over his
shoulder, rushed out of the court. He merely observed, that he would
leave his case in the hands of PUBLICOPINIos.
PUBLIC OFINIon, observed, he did not wish to press severely upon
the prisoner, but said he must ask for bail to protect OLD TIME against
a repetition of such assaults for the future.
The prisoner sent for several friends—MR. NEwBEGATE, CoLoREL
SIRTHoRPE, and others—but when our reporter left the court no bail
had arrived. At that time, it just wanted ten minutes of the Wan, and
QLE TIME was seen looking round the corner, with a jocund eye upon
his hour-glass.
OUR FUTURE CONTEMPORARIES.
It is with feelings of pride mingled with no little pleasure that we notice the growing
moustache of our respected Beadle. It is of a light straw colour, not altogether unlike
tow, only much silkierin its appearance. As the moustache is not more than two weeks'
old, it would be rather premature as yet to judge of the effect, but when it has attained
its full growth, we candidly think that it will add materially to the dignified aspect of
our worthy functionary. We regret to state, however, that the boys º neighbour-
hood do not treat the improvement with that marked respect, which an old constituted
authority, like the Beadle, is proudly entitled to, but our regret is agreeably lessened
}. the philosophic reflection, that boys at all times will be boys—The Pºntonville Penny
triot.
On Thursday last, as Mrs. Caocher's Seminary for Young Ladies was passing the
Rev. Dr. Switch KANE's Academy for Young Gentlemen, we noticed that some of
the elder boys (who, judging from their straps and stand-up collars, were certainly of
an age to know better) laughed, made faces, and winked at the tallest of the young
ladies. Such conduct in the high road is, to say the very least, highly reprehensible
and extremely indecorous, and we hope that the young offenders received, when they
returned to ARMA-VIRUMQue House, that salutary punishment which their shameless
behaviour so glaringly deserved.—The Hammersmith Fly and Brentford Bluebottle.
If the Thames could be cleaned there is but little doubt that it would soon be crowded,
as in the days of our Saxon ancestors, with fish of all sorts. Let the water be as pure
as it was two thousand years ago, and we should in all probability be able to venture
out to Lambeth pier, catch our salmon, or young trout, and return home to have it
cooked for breakfast.—John Baown's Political and Literary Ha'porth of All Sorts.
What are all the flags of Europe but so many pieces of bunting, stained in iniquit
of every possible dye P. We value them at so low a figure, our own Flag not excepted,
that we should be sorry to give a new cotton pocket-handkerchief in exchange for any
one of them.—The Manchester Gridiron and Salford Pepper Box.
Kitchen Stuff has risen within the last week as much as a halfpenny a pound, and
we have been informed of one transaction alone, at Pimlico, by which the lucky holder
cleared not less than three and twopence, and this was exclusive of silver spoons!—The
Cook's Oracle for Belgravia and Seven Adjoining Parishes.
When will the superior classes think of encouraging our native products? Is it not
a shame to our pampered aristocracy, that our celebrated Chelsea Bun is not more
patronised than it is 7–The Battersea Battle-axe and Chelsea Penny Trumpet of Universal
Preedom.
Ten Shillings Reward have been offered for the discovery of the miscreant, who pla-
carded the REveakND MR. Love BIRD's Chapel of Comfort and Ease all over with the
bills of the Dying Swan Saloon, announcing amongst other profane monstrosities, that
MR. John Cooper would sing the “Ratcatcher's Daughter" in character.—The Clapham
Whitechoker (Edited by JABEz PEckswirr, Esq.)
A Ship that Ought to be Put Under a Glass Shade.
'... We see, and we never should have believed it unless we had seen it,
that there is a transport of the name of the Earl of Aberdeen. The
discovery fairly took us by surprise, as we did not know that in the
| English mind the name of ABERDEEN had ever given rise before to a
single transport.

MRS. GRUNDY'S ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM.
MRs. GRUNDY is about to set her house in order. So, after it has

which, of course, MR. GRUNDY is to pay for), she is resolved, once and
or all, upon having quite a new system of things established and main-
tained in her estab lº. She will no longer allow her house to be
the scandal of the neighbourhood. The following are a few of the
Reforms she has set her heart upon:-
I. The door to be closed every night at eleven. . . . .
II. The mistress of the house to have the exclusive hiring of the
servants.
III. Nothing but cheese for supper! -

ill or not! - -

GROSS ATTEMPTAT IMPOSITION ON MEDICAL MEN.
THERE are plenty of Members of the Medical Profession who would
only be too happy to pay the aggravated Income Tax, or any Income
Tax that left them any me. . Thanks to MR. HEADIAM, MR.
|BRADY, and MR. CRAUFURD, those individuals stand a very fair chance

of that tax, will be absent from this. In order to be liable to it, there
ill be no necessity that the subject should possess any income at all.
he happy medical man will, if MR HEADIAM and his accomplices
succeed in their design, befined 20s. for the mere permission to con:
tinue attempting to earn his bread. These men have brought in a bill
|“to alter and amend the law regulating the Medical Profession,” of
which one clause enacts, that all º in lawful practice before the
first day of November next, shall be registered, on having their pockets
º of one pound. After that date the robbery is to amount to TEN
oUNDs: and without ºf to this spoliation, they will be unable
to recover their charges, disqualified from holding appointments, and
accounted guilty of a misdemeanour in practising their profession.
War time—prices, rising—likely to rise higher How fervently the
Poor Law Union Medical Officer, counting his patients by several
thousands, and his salary by very few tens, with a deduction formedicine

upon the head of HEARLAM, by reason of the winter bonnet diverted,
in the shape of her husband's registration fee, from her own! Take
one pound from a pauper medical practitioner's income—you can’t, as
the schoolboys say: one from º hought; but HEADLAM and
o, propose to work out the sum after November: when it will be,
one from nought you can't, ºne from ten, nine, and carry one; and the
one “carried” will be added to the nine, to make ten—the figure, in
pounds, at which the medico-chirurgical starveling who has forgotten,
or has been unable, to register himself at the comparatively petty-
larcenous imposition of 20s, will then be plundered.
Why this enormous medical confiscation? To provide oil, it would
seem, for greasing the tremendous machinery which will be created by
the proposed bill; a Medical Council conjointly organised by the united
Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, the united universities of the United
Kingdom, and the Secretary of State. This grand Council is to appoint
examiners in the three capitals, “to examine candidates for medical
diplomas, preliminarily,” in classics, the exact sciences, and general
literature. Under the latter head, of course, the pages of Punch will
be included—but if, a little more than a century ago, it had been neces-
sary for Surgeons to have been thus examined “ preliminarily ;” if, in
short, the f had been rendered illustrious by MR. HEADLAM, would
it have had the advantage of possessing unclassical MR. HUNTERP
The former philosopher, we find, further proposes, that while “Sur-
geons” must be 22 years of age, the statutable age of “Physicians”
shall be 26. Surely this wise man should likewise propose, that general
practitioners, inasmuch as they act in both eapacities, shall be 22 plus
36, or is "We thought, moreover, that the said Husºn, and sub.
sequently another individual of the same sort, one AbgºNETHY, had

individual, the said HEADLAM.

feitures, and vexatious formalities, MR. HEADLAM would devote his

XIV. No invitations to be henceforth accepted, unless the name of
MRs. GRUNDY is included in them. -
XV. M.R. GRUNDY, for the future, to pay for his own washing.
XVI. All letters to be opened by MRs. G., for MR. GRUNDY should
have, and moreover he says he has, no secrets from his wife
—and if there are secrets in those letters, he cannot object
to her sharing them with him,
As soon as the above Reforms are carried, others of a still more
tringent nature are contemplated,
legislative abilities to the suppression of the traffic in patent medicines,
he might serve both the Profession and the Public, by diminishing
starvation in the former, and poisoning among the latter. But the
tendency of his bill is to facilitate the sale of stamped specifics by im-
peding the legitimate practice of physic. By the bye, is W. HEADLAM
the proprietor of any * remedy? Is HEADLAM the man, and
olloway merely an alias?
An Extraordinary Question.
The Morning Chronicle of the 7th inst, puts the following extra-
ordinary question:—“What is the use of a Bishop?”
...To this Mr. Punch readily makes answer—the use of a Bishop is to
illustrate in the flesh the Christian virtues of humility and self-denial
at a various income, ranging from three to ten thousand pounds per
annum. Moreover, there can be no doubt that all this is done, and very
well done, at the money.

Infallible Cure for a Short Sight.
The sudden acquisition of a large fortune is the best cure. It has been known to, cure

merits even, eminently conspicuous, whereas both had previousl been for years quite

DE BELLO CIWILI.
It is sometimes said, that civility costs nothing,
but it would seem that the civility of the Civil
Service in civilly waiting to have justice done to
them in the matter of superannuation may cost
a great deal. Every civil servant with a salary
above one hundred a year, has five per cent.
taken from him to meet a claim for retired allow-
ances, which it is said that one per cent. would
fully satisfy. Several successive Chancellors of
the Exchequer have acknowledged the injustice
of this º and promised aremedy; but
this promise has not yet been fulfilled. So gross
is the injustice of the tax, that the “opposition”
offered to do the civil thing to the Civil Service,
if the Government neglected it, and an indepen-
a homoeopathist.
dent member also pledged himself to introduce a
measure on the subject; but, as it happens to
be everybody’s business, it shares the fate of
nobody's business, and is not done at all. Every
|civil servant appointed since a certain date is
z- paying twelve pounds out of every hundred by
º of income tax, or rather he is getting
eighty-eight instead of every hundred pounds he
is supposed to receive. It has generally been
thought a capital joke to victimise a recipient
of the public money, and to talk of “bloated
officials,” of whom certain clerks at Somerset
House, with some half-dozen children and in-
comes varying from eighty to two hundred and
fifty pounds per annum, are not very obese speci-
mens; but though the public may have its laugh
the ChanceLLOR or The Exchequer should
take care that the Civil Service when smarting
under an admitted hardship should not find its
| cry in vain.
A HOMOEOPATHIC SUNDAY.
LoRD RoRERT GRosvenor is, it is well known,
Doubtlessly, it is in this cha.
racter that, he would wish to give, the people
a homoeopathic Sunday? He would administer
to them infinitesimal doses of recreation; the
smallest globules, of pleasure, mixed up with
brimming pailsful of abstinence and privation.
He would have them limited, if he could, to the
hillionth part of a ride in an omnibus, with the
500,000th part of a dram of a glass of ale, and
the rººm of the crumb of a sandwich, by way of
refreshment; not a scruple of anything excepting
religious scruples, and as many of those as you
like—the scruples being against shaving, reading,
dining (unless you have a French cook to dress
your dinner for you at home), eating, drinking,
(except you have a good cellar and larder in your
own house, or belong to a club), and against all
rational and innocent forms of amusement in
general. We doubt, however, if this Hahne-
mannising the British Public would have been
exactly humanising them, or would have put them
into the most fitting humour for going to church.
We are afraid that many a poor fellow with a
hungry stomach would have wished that homoeo:
pathy had never been applied to politics; and
in his anger would have inveighed bitterly against
LoRD RoPERT for being such an exceedingly
homoeopathic legislator.

"I TELL YER what, BILL, I THINK THE PolicE ARE A BAD Lot—AND
I wish THEY was DoNE Away witH ALTogether.”
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
July 9th, Monday. LoRD DERBy hinted to the Lords that the season
was nearly over, and people were going out of town, and therefore that
it would be as well not to bother themselves with more business than
could be helped....On this hint Lord LYNDHURST threw over an Oath
of Abjuration Bill, though he thought that the continuing the oath
which he wished to get rid of was “an act of impiety,” and Lord
Winchelsea resigned the pleasure of an onslaught upon the Roman
Catholic Prelates, who, as he thought, and thought very rightly, had
been most improperly described in the Maynooth report by their
ridiculous ecclesiastical titles. The Accidents on Railways Bill passed,
with a characteristic protest from LoRD St. LEONARDs against viola.
ting the rights of property by protecting people's lives.
In the Commons, SIR BENJAMIN HALL abandoned the Public Health
Bill, despairing of getting it passed so late in the session. SIR CHARLEs
WooD explained that a certain bombardment of Old Town, at Calabar,
on the African Coast, by HER MAJESTY's ship Antelope, had been a
sort of Public Health Measure for that locality, for the African chiefs
were in the unpleasant habit of poisoning their subjects, so the mission-
aries had begged for a brief discourse from the mouths of our guns
against the practice. Loºp PALMERston promised that all the cor-
respondence on the proposal which had been sº by the Austrian
Count John Russell, should be produced, and he fulfilled his promise
on the Thursday following. There was a good deal of talk about the
window-breaking on the previous day. The impression was, that the
lice were sulky because complaint had been made of the brutality
isplayed by some of their number in the park, and that they had
abstained from energetic interference with the window-breakers. SIR
GeoRGE GREY promised that “next time” every precaution should be
en.
MR. WALTER then referred to . PROFEssoR FARADAY's call upon
Father Thames, with whom the eminent, philosopher had left, his card,
as set forth in Mr. Punch's cartoon this week), and of whom MR.
ARADAY gave a most hideous account. MR. WALTER asked whether
any plan had been decided on by Government for diverting the sewage
of the metropolis away from the river, which it now poisoned. SIR
BENNAMIN #. said, that at present there was no plan decided upon,
but several plans were under consideration. . By way of further com:
ment, the report of the Registrar-General, a day or two later, announced
that the inevitable consequence of leaving the river in its present state
would be an epidemic among the people. The people swarming along
iſ about that of Mr. Punch and
º just and reasona
h
the banks of the Thames, and the small unwholesome streets, adjacent,
had therefore better write at once to their housekeepers to have their
country seats ready, or desire their agents to secure houses at Brighton
or Ramsgate.
Tuesday. LoRD CLARENDoN said, that the Russian authorities had
made untrue statements in reference to the Hango, atrocity, and that
ADMIRAL DUNDAs had been instructed to demand a better explanation,
and also the immediate release of the prisoners. - - -
In the Commons, SIR BULWER Lytton announced his intention of
'moving a resolution, declaring that the conduct of LORD John
Russell at Vienna had shaken the confidence of the country in HER
| MAJESTY's Government. This startling, notification occasioned con-
siderable sensation, which was increased by MR. DISRAELI's stating
that he meant to ask, whether Lord John Russell had obtained HER
|MAJESTY's leave to reveal state secrets, as he had done. On the fol-
lowing Thursday LoRD John was obliged to confess that he had not
had the QUEEN's leave; and added, with his usual logic, that such
leave had uot been necessary, and therefore (upon MR. DISRAEl's
hint) he had been and asked for it. HER MAJESTY, “had been
graciously pleased to sanction what he had done.” This doing a thing
first, and then asking leave to do it, sometimes gets little people into
scrapes, but this time LoRD John was lucky, and if Mr. Punch were at
liberty to reveal the words in which the §º: good-naturedly told
John that he might do or say just what he liked, it would probably be
|| thought that HER MAJESTY's estimate of his Lordship's importance is
the public. LoRD John also remarked
that it was a shame to suppose that because he thought the Austrian
|. April, he should think so in July; and
e declared that the war ought to be vigorously prosecuted. 8 all-
nouncement was received by the Commons of England-
“Men whom John has often Led"-
with “shouts of derisive laughter.” Evidently, as in MR. SQUEERs's
case, “the coat-of-arms of the RussELLs is tore, and their sun is gone
down into the hocean wave.”
Mr. Punch need not say that MR. DisrAELI came out upon this
matter, and was very felicitous in taunting the Government with
various endeavours which they had made to dodge away, behind the
forms of the House, from SIR BULwer Lytton's motion. . And, BEN-
JAMIN put one point so neatly that it is worthy to be immortalised here.
He º that the moment }. PAIMERston heard SIR BULWER's
notice, he changed all the business of the House, and, for the night on
which the baronet proposed to attack John Russell, PALMERStoN set
down the New Partnership Bill, and the Limited ifiability Bill." Why,”
said MR. DisrAELI, “the New Partnership Bill? hat the people
wanted to know was, what were the conditions of partnership in
Downing-street !—they wanted to know whether the principles of
“limited liability’ were prevalent in that locality, or whether the
people were to enjoy the general and collective responsibility of the
ministers of the crown, which had theretofore been the salutary and
constitutional course.” This was very neat, and if MR. DisrAELI,
instead of feeling gratified that his jokes are transferred to Mr. Punch's
pages, thinks that be is entitled to remuneration for them, Mr. Punch,
who is the soul of honour, will hand the Right Honourable Gentleman
a cheque any day he will call at No. 85.
To complete the story, it should be said, that MR. Roebuck tried to
get a “call” of the House for his motion of general censure on the
managers of the Crimean Campaign, but was defeated by 133 to 108,
members contending that it was deuced inconvenient to be called up to
town to attend to the business of the country. And it was finally
arranged that MR. Roebuck should give way to SIR BULweRLYTTON,
and that the latter should open fire on the following Monday.
On this same Tuesday there was rather a good debate, originated by
MR. WINCENT Scully, regarding examination of candidates for public
offices. LoRD PALMeRSTON declared that Government were gradually
extending the system, and he º: the House not to interfere, but
on division there was a very small majority with him, 140 to 125 being
the numbers by which MR. Scully's resolution for examining every-
body, and doing it in public, was got rid of by .# the previous
question—an avoidance of a decision on the subject itself... -
Poor APSLEY PELLATT, whom no snubbing and counting out will
convince that he is the wrong man in the wrong place, tried to be
heard about some army question, but he was lite shouted down,
and then in a rage he moved the adjournment of the House, and this
was put and negatived, and then he was squashed, for the moment.
Hednesday. The Church Rates Abolition Bill was debated, and at
last members talked against time, in order to postpone the decision,
and the device succeeded.
Thursday. The most interesting part of the Thursday's work has
been described. The new Turkish loan was º: England and
France are to guarantee £5,000,000 borrowed by Turkey, but Turkey is
to spend the money on the war. Perhaps, some day, if she should not
§ up her dividends, a British fleet, like that which went to “collect”
he Greek money, may—but we will not speak of such things.
There was a fight on the Scotch Education Bill, as to which a

number of Scotch Members have suddenly been converted by menaces
from the Scotch clergy. The LoRD Advocate well said that “the people
wanted education; but while the House was discussing, miserable
abstract theories, a generation was growing up in ignorance.” But the
appeal was lost upon the tools of the northern priests, and the third
reading was carried by three only (105 to 102), but the Bili was passed
by a little better majority, 130 to 115. -
Then came an Irish row. The Irishmen, in terror of their priests,
have been obliged to threaten the Government with hostility, if the
Tenants Compensation Bill be not restored to a somewhat more mis-
chievous condition than that to which the good sense of the House had
reduced it. LoRD PALMERSTON, in his turn, was compelled to give "...i
affecting to be delighted at the self-stultification of the Ministry, an
MR. MAGUIRE, member for Cork, explained, point-blank, the position
which Irish members occupy. “What we have to do is to keep our:
selves dangerous to honourable gentlemen on either side of the House.”
This explanation of the principle on which legislation is conducted
for the United Kingdom—this demonstration that by preserving a
“balance” which can turn out a Liberal or Tory Government, the
ignorant Irish priests virtually rule the three nations—so disgusted
Mr. Punch that he stalked out of the House in a rage, and went out of
town. . Whether he condescends to come back again quite depends
upon circumstances.
LIST FOR A SOLDIER,
2 HE dingyuniform of the Militia
has already been the subject of
the most serious observations
in these columns. A CoRPORAL
IN THE GLAMORGAN MILITIA
has taken up the same impor-
tant subject in a letter to the
Times, and, with a fine eye for
colour, he describes the tint
of the militia coat as a “muddy
red.” CoRPORAL TAFFY says
that the Welsh tailors call the
cloth, of which this garment is
made, “padding; ” and it is
evidently fit for no other pur-
§: than the one indicated
y that word, unless to be cut
up into strips and º: to
the cultivation of wall fruit.
The Corporal further shows
that the lower extremities of
the Militia are clothed in serge
trousers at eight shillings,
worth only five; and he proves
that the force is decreasing in
consequence of the badness of
its uniform. . When we con-
sider the passion which the gentler sex entertain for the red coat,
and reflect that this is one of the principal causes of enlistment, we
view the shabby clothes of the Mi. with alarm as well as
distaste. Are the materials of the Militia Uniform supplied by the
members of the Peace Society, who want to discourage recruiting, and
make money by one and the same expedient? Is the discoloration of
the Militia coat occasioned by an admixture of drab?

tion. “All persons to produce certificate of vaccination on demand of

out the words “Produce certificate of vaccination”—and substitute—
M.P. for the British Constitution. Sir, I’ve an amendment, before
that. rise, Sir, to move an amendment on, this most, inquisi.
torial provision. f am surprised—no—I am not surprised—for I
am only too well aware of the utter disregard which the framer
and promoters of this Bill and of Bills like this, have always
shown to the liberties of the subject, and the admirable provisions
of our Common *... .sº matters affecting the welfare of
this—great community. What, Sir, I ask the House—this Committee
—is it to be tolerated that the country should be dragooned over in this
manner by a set of persons—Registrars though they be—poking their
noses into every man's house, and demanding to see his certificate of
vaccination, perhaps to take his coat off and show his marks? - Good
heavens, Sir, where is this sort of thing to end? The Common Law is
explicit, as it always is, on the point. Any person who goes about with
the smallpox on him commits a nuisance punishable on indictment; and,
therefore, I say, if you pass this clause, instead of an Englishman's
house being his castle, which it has been our proud boast, wherever the
tegis of British Constitutional liberty, the palladium of our rights, has
flourished, for which our forefathers bled in the field, and which has
braved for ten thousand years the battle and the breeze. I say-I say,
Sir, all this is annihilated by this most iniquitous—this most inquisi-

If this clause be struck out the whole bill becomes unintelligible. All
the preceding sections refer to the certificate required by this section.
For instance, section 2 speaks of “such certificate as hereinafter pro-
vided”-and if we strikeout this section no certificate will be provided.
3rd M.P. Sir, I beg to move that the words “of three months old”
be inserted at the word “persons” in line ten.
Chairman. The amendment before the Committee is that the section
proposed to be struck out stand part of this Bill.

ointed out to the Committee, that, if this section be omitted, the whole
ill becomes waste paper.
4th M.P. (sotto voce, to Chairman.) Put it—put it.
Chairman. It is proposed to omit section 15. The question is that sec-
tion 15 stand part of this Bill? Those of that opinion say “aye,” the con-
trary “no,”—the “ayes” have it. Now, Sir? (to 3rd Honourable Member.)
3rd M.P. I beg to propose, Sir, the limitation of this section to
ersons of three months' . It is all very well to insist on infants
elng ºl. vaccinated, but it is surely not to be tolerated that an
attempt should be made to coerce adults, as is done by this section.
Why Sir, there is nothing in this section to prevent the Registrar
coming into my dining-room when I am at dinner with my friends and
family, and insisting on my producing my certificate of vaccination.
M.P. in charge of Bill. I’m quite ready to put in “at reasonable
hours,” I move Sir, in line 11, after the word “shall” to insert–
Chairman. No-no. There’s an amendment in line 10. Proposed after
the words “all persons,” to insert the words “of three months old.”. The
question is, that the words proposed be inserted. Those who are of that—
M.P. in charge of Bill. Before you put the question, Sir, I wish to
point out to the Committee that the last section has required an oath,
or in lieu thereof a declaration, of all persons giving such certificate as
hereinafter provided. Now, if you are to limit the giving of a certifi-
cate to persons of three months old, how are they to make such oath
or declaration as you have already required them to do? I put this to
the Honourable Member who moves this amendment, as a difficulty to
be considered by him, before he presses this amendment:
Chairman. Does the Honourable Member withdraw his amendment?
Amendment withdrawn—now (to Hon. Member in charge of Bill).

to insert the words “at all reasonable hours.”

insert the words, “at all reasonable hours.” The question is that the
words proposed be inserted. Those who are of that opinion say “aye,”
the contrary “not” the “ayes” have it. It is proposed in line 12 to
leave out the words "certificate of vaccination,” and insert P-
6th M.P. Before you put that, Sir, I wish, with reference to
the amendment just carried, to call the attention of the Honourable
Gentleman in charge of this Bill, and the Committee to the fact, that

pose of the Act between the hours of six in the morning and mine at

the Ecclesiastical Commission, and its subordinate organisation, the
Church Estates’ Commission, pay over to lawyers and surveyors very
nearly the sum of £45,000! And this, too, as the Eraminer observes,
“after it was supposed that the Legislature had introduced some im:
provements into the management of the body.” How many curates at
£80, or even at the larger munificence of a £100 per annum, might not
have had a few more penny loaves, a dozen or two additional sprats for
themselves and families, out of this º of £45,000, expended on
the preciousness of lawyers' tape and parchment, and surveyors' rule
and compasses! With such expensive parchment have the bishops the
proper thought of the wants of Christian flocks,—with such costly rule-
work, do they best adhere to the rule of right?
Why, with such rewards dropped to law and surveying from the
liberal hands of bishops, why was not the late Doctor John KITTo
either an attorney, or a man of line and compasses: Then working for
worldly bishops, he might have easily left his widow in easiest case.
But Doctor º, worked for the bishops in another sphere. His
doings were with no contemporary parchment. He merely worked for
sacred letters. He wrote upon such matters as the flocks of ABRAHAM ;
he only surveyed the Holy Land. And his reward, was, a life of
poverty; and dying, a wretched £50 per annum is doled out to his
widow, from pensions granted upon the civil list. We marvel what
works, the doings of a Bishop of Oxford, or even of a BISHOP OF
ExETER (all his º pamphlets included), may weigh in the balance

REMARKABLE TRANKING OPERA-TIONS. '
It is said that Her Majesty's Theatre is about to be opened as a
West End Branch of the Bank of England. This, indeed, would be
an illustration of the meeting of extremes; for what can be more op-
osite than a ruined theatre, and the wealthiest banking establishment
in Europe. The locality is undoubtedly one from which notes of the
highest value have been issued, but it will be a somewhat novel experi;
ment to send forth Bank of England notes from a spot, where those of
GRISI and other celebrities have acquired their currency. If business is
to commence immediately, the Bank parlour will have to be made up of
a set-scene, and the directors will possibly have to meet in the “sacred
grove” of the Druids; while the issue department may be carried on
through the openings in the “cut-wood” of the Somnambula. We
hope for the sake of the once spirited proprietor, that the rumour we
have mentioned is founded in truth, for he could not get rid of all his
old scores more successfully than by converting his theatre into a branch
of the Bank of England.

A PHILOSOPHER AFLOAT,
AcHEMICAI, work of small size and great importance has been lately
published. The production alluded to is FARADAY on the Thames; a
title which means even more than it appears to mean; for it not only
expresses. PROFEssoR FARADAy’s views of the composition of the river,
but also describes the sensations experienced by him during a period of
brief transit upon its surface. A piece of white card, according to the
rofessor, becomes invisible at a very small degree of submersion in the

plain the º of water, pure and simple; but we rejoice much
more that he has enabled the public to form a correct idea of the con-
stituents of that of the Thames; which consists of something more than
Oxygen, and Hydrogen. Because we are losing brave men by war, it is
rather the more desirable, than otherwise that we should not also lose
useful citizens by pestilence, as we certainly shall if the Thames
continues much longer to be an open sewer. We hope that PROFEssor
FARADAY's publication, which takes the shape of a concise letter to the
Times, will effect a saving of human life still greater than that which has
resulted from his predecessor's safety-lamp. Davy's invention prevents
carburetted hydrogen from blowing up miners; may FARADAY's epistle
avert cholera and typhus, by stirring up senatorial and municipal persons
to prevent sulphuretted hydrogen from being disengaged.
A Nominal Error.
SoMEBODY has invented an instrument which he calls a “Palmerston,
or Judicious Bottle Holder.”. The object is to enable a person to take
hold of a bottle without soiling his fingers. If this is really the case,
the invention should hardly be called a Palmerston, for in the conduct
of the war, or in other words, in his mode of dealing with the Porte,
the PREMIER himself has not come out with entirely clean hands.

property, that another pays on the interest of his capital, is cheated,
this payment of ‘conscience money,” by anybody,but a capitalist, is
payment of money, at the instigation ºf a morbid conscience: is, in
short, an act of madness. We always doubted that any person could
e so insane as to send the tax on his precarious income, out 9ſ which
the law has forgotten to cheat him, to the Governmentº-could be such
a fool as to cheat himself in preference to cheating flowning Street.
We have long suspected that the CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequºin:
serts these paragraphs in the Times, in order to1." colour to the
delusion that people are satisfied with the Income-Tex. All doubt on
that subject is now removed from our mind by the following announce-
ment, appended to the leaders of our leading contemporary :-
“The Chancellon or the Exchrough also acknowledges the receipt of a Bank
note for £50 as Income Tax from ‘A Lawyer.'"
Now, this is too much. It is drawing the bow that is too ...; We
are not incredulous—we would examine the subject of Homoeopathy: we
would, if possible, investigate the liqueſaction of th; Blood of SAINT
JANUARIUs; but believe that a lawyer would pay “E50 as income-
tax,” under any circumstances than those of legal process.-no! No,
Sir George Córºwº Lewis, you don't come the old soldier in that
way over us.

ALREApy the blight is telling upon the trees and suckers of know-
ledge-the Cheap Newspapers. At the time of ºur going to pres; the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 29
IL TRovaTore.
If you’ll listen awhile, I will tell you a story
Of the popular opera, Il Tropatore.
What’s Il Trovatore ? A foundling, no doubt,
From Trocare, to find; but, excuse me, you’re out.
'Tis hardly yet known to three folks out of four
That Il Trovatore’s the (young) Troubadour.
The curtain goes up, and the audience soon are
Surveying the halls of the Conte di Luna.
The title is strange, but its owner will soon
Give proof of his right to take rank from the moon;
l'or his conduct becomes so decidedly bad,
That charity kindly considers him mad:
Attendants discover'd, all sleepy and spooney:
Is it strange that the servants of Luna are mooney?
Though anywhere else one would wake them by ringing,
On the stage ’tis the fashion to rouse folks by singing.
An upper domestic, Fernando by name,
Proceeds to allude to some violent flame
That’s consuming his master—who's got an amour–
And fears as a rival the young Troubadour.
For ’tis a remarkable thing on the stage,
A Count in a courtship can never engage.
But straight to his servants he secks to impart
The secret (he calls it) that burns in his heart.
The servants, however, have heard it before,
And threaten to sink into slumber once more,
Unless, the old story’s replaced by another,
Not touching their master, but touching his brother.
The principal servant, who’s made it his part
To get all the family secrets by heart
Čáſ, all the domestics and soldiers about him;
And though 'twould be very much nobler to scout him,
With keen curiosity gathering round, -
They give to his scandal attention profound.
The story is thus:– “Count di Luna the late one,
{} ho being deceased is of course called the great one).
f two darling sons was the fortunate sire,
When a witch º was afterwards thrown in the fire)
At the cradle of one of the boys came to sit,
And sent the young gentleman off in a fit.
The Count had the sorceress burnt to a cinder;
But the hag had a daughter, who seeing the tinder,
With wonderful instinct, by some means or other,
Collecting the dust, re-collected her mother.
With horrible vengeance, and energy wild,
She caught from its cradle the innocent child,
And, near to the spot where her mother was roasted,
Some small bones were found very recently toasted.
The chorus, of course, with discretion sublime,
ºxpress their disgust at the low person’s crime:
Though they suffer'd without observation to pass
The act of the man of superior class.
By one of those instincts that seldom prevail,
Except on the stage, where they’re sure not to fail,
The Count a belief in his child's safety owns,
Notwithstanding the startling affair of the bones;
And so the old gentleman, just as he died
Had summon'd the Count (Number 2) to his side,
And made him most |u}. promise and swear
He'd look for his brother—for though quite aware
Qf the bones the poor child was consider'd the owner,
Further search might return them e'en yet nulla bond.
The woman by whom the vile deed was committed,
From all her pursuers successfully flitted.
For criminals always, in opera or play,
(However well known) can keep out of the way.
'Tis true she’s the neighbourhood often infested,
But somehow or other she’s not been arrested.
The people have seen her, on chimney and cowl,
At times as a crow, once or twice as an owl;
But to catch this strange bird they incessantly fail,
Or even to put any salt on its tail.
So the servants disgusted at finding a hitch
In their own bad arrangements for catching the witch,
Agree, in a chorus, she ought to be cursed,
Which brings to a spirited end—Scene the First.
Scene Tico—is a palace with gardens at night,
The moon and the stars show cach other a light,
Two ladies approach, Leonora and Ine: ;
The latter without the least atom of shyness,
§: an attendant) begins to reprove
he former for feeling a dangerous love,
A confidante wishing the sorrows to soften
f a principal singer, can't hear them too often,
The latter is ask’d to repeat them once more,
If the audience haven’t been told them before,
How came you to love him, says Inez, and when?
Leonora replies—that the dearest of men,
She met at a tournament, where in a quarrel,
He gain'd that absurd piece of rubbish a laurel
Which—though to the gardening business not bred,
She planted right up on the top of his head.
The knight with the º stuff no sooner was crown'd,
Than all of a sudden he couldn't be found;
13ut though non inventus, he wasn't a brute, , ,
And struck up an air (out of sight) on his flute.* -
The solo was heard with attention serene,
But still the executant couldn’t be seen;
And though he was look’d for, 'tis natural quite
(On the stage) to explore every place but the right.
Another remarkable fact then occurr'd,
For the name Leonora distinctly was heard;
And though p’rhaps a singer could easily say it,
'Tis hard to conceive how a flutist could play it.
The lady, of course, as all heroines do
(Qn the stage), to the lattice immediately flew.
'Tis the stranger—she burns with a sudden amour,
For this flute-playing, eaves-dropping, strange Troubadour.
“Forget him,” says Inez., “Forget him I can't,”
Exclaims Leonora, “and therefore I sha’n’t.
If for him unable to live—tell me why
I shouldn't make other arrangements—and die.”
To the back of the stage the two ladies then mount.
When ereunt ambo and enter the Count.
He looks at the window, and seeing a light,
Observes Leonora's not sleeping to-night;
Forgetting that people, not partial to gloom,
Will sleep with an º: or ChILDf in the room.
Approaching the window to catch p'rhaps a sound
From the voice of his love, in the stillness ...
Or should she be sleeping, expecting a snore—
He’s struck by the voice of the sad Troubadour.
His jº ’s roused, for he feels his position—
'Tis his rival, the beggarly strolling musician.
The lady descends with an anima mia
Address'd to the Count, who’s astonish’d to see her
Shrink back, like a bail that rebounds from the floor
At hearing the voice of the young Troubadour.
The moon, which has hitherto been 'neath a shroud,
Is, thanks to a well-bred theatrical cloud
Released from the veil—a disc-over it laid,
And thus an important disc-overy's made;
For seeing the Minstrel, the lady, whose views
Are musical, throws herself down at his shoes;
Forgetting alike both her sex and her station,
She makes to the flutist a bold declaration.
The Count’s in a rage—having heard her confess
That she favours the strolling musician's address;
And burning with anger, proceeds to exclaim,
... Since she’s got your address, p'rhaps you’ll give me yourname.”
“MANRIco’s my name,” cries the flutist. No sooner
Does the word reach the ears of the lunatic Luna,
Than he casts his abuse, like a boy throwing pebbles,
On the Minstrel, and calls him the chief of th: rebels.
The gentlemen sing with remarkable power,
Saying, each has arrived at his ultimate hour.
And though one another most anxious to kill,
They execute jointly a beautiful trill.
Though the Count is determined the life-blood to take
Qf MANRIgo-the rivals concur, in a shake.
They flourish their weapons—then jointly they pause,
Awaiting the end of a round of applause.
The top of their voices the couple then reach,
While poor Leonora approaches a screech,
For the music of WERDI is known to require
The voice to go higher, and higher and igher.
No wonder, that just as the First Act is o'er,
§§ exhausted, drops down on the floor;,
While the gentlemen, having expended their might
In shouting—are forced to retire to fight.
A fight on the stage quite another thing means
From a duel (supposed) at the back of the scenes,
Where the combatants—all their hostility over,
Sit puffing and blowing their wind to recover.

"RABELAIS IN THE CRIMEA.
How RABELAIs, after leaving the Great Bridlegoose, got into mired
Company, and learnt doubtful Ideas on Things sacred.
I LEFT the Great Bridlegoose, who had taught me so many wonders,
and, as it were by magic found myself in a mixture of quiet homely
people, a small dash o thieves who did charge vigorously, and a large
number of land-lobsters in their native blue coats, the which did never-
theless require the main turned on to keep them in fitting disorder.
These same did use their claws º the curious shape of clubs) most
artificially against weak women, children, or quiet people, and did with
most judicious inefficience leave pickpockets and prizefighters to their
own fortunes. These same did swear, talk vilely, run under barriers
when they could not jump them, look valiant in numbers, and ride on
cabs that they could not drive. And these lobsters, mark you, did it
not out of their own head or out of malice prepense (as the learned in
the law do say), but because the great Animal of the two Ears, had an
idea that ple cannot meet together, without swallowing his own
lobsters, his measures being, like his wit, a forgotten question, ...;
that he who understandeth nothing of what he is talking about, knowet
little and teacheth less, and that he who runs away from the great
beast Public, scarcely meets it fairly.
...And this was all because the great Animal of the two Ears could only
give ear to one side of a question. He was tolerably kind, especially to
those who let him have his own way, and was much pitied and regretted
by those who saw that thistles, must ever be the food, of those who
prefer them to figs, and who think turning a place of harmless recreation
into a bear-garden, the best worship of Him whom all adore.
...And others did say that certain places called Claves, Anglice Clubs,
did remain open for the benefit of big sinners, grown on a rich soil,
while the public-houses for the middle or lower people were kept shut,
even as the temple of JANUs when there were no Sabbatarians to keep
it open. Some did say that those who worked all six days deserved the
chance of a dinner on the seventh, and that those who are paid at eight
or nine o'clock on Saturday mights have ill chance of a good market:
some did say that a Lord whose own goose has been cooked, and whose
horse can be driven on the seventh as well as any other day, should
abstain from meddling with smaller birds or their dinners. Öthers did
say, that Mayne force was not the best way of influencing the feelings
of peaceableH.; who only wanted to F. certain animals braying
too loud, and spoiling the privileges of their own Common.
And I did see many strange things, the like of which I hope I may
fºur-lººd is crumbled into the brains of its own
º Grº.
I did see a very mighty ass on horseback, the like of which I never
saw before.
I saw about a couple of dozen, of baker's dozen, of raw lobsters, the
which did ply their claws as aforesaid.
I saw a child trampled on, and a small woman knocked down—the
which I was told were merely a sample. . . . -
I saw Lord G–’s common sense walking in company with Chaos
along a Rotten Row.
I saw several thousand skinned eels, who nevertheless could keep a
coat on their backs, against which, being defenceless, the aforesaid
lobsters did use their claws.
I i. some broken heads, the which I was told did much for Sunday
morality.
I heard several lobsters use some of the uncleanest language I never
wish to hear, which conduceth to ditto.
I also saw, among other strange impossibilities, seven ounces of
Government Common Sense. So small was the amount, that I lost
sight of it in trying the hunt after some Sabbatarian Christianity.
I came to the understanding, that if all men of the public were not
fools, some of their rulers were.
I also learnt that Cant is not Religion. -
And I learnt all the lobster slang, blackguardism, abuse, and brutalily,
that the wits of the Great Talking Shop had provided for the enter-
tainments of their own peculiar Sabbath, and much I got by it.
PUNCH AND THE POST.
Although an enormous increase in the circulation of Punch has
resulted from the increased facilities for the conveyance of this cele-
brated publication in the British Islands, a serious inconvenience will
be inflicted upon Mr. Punch by the obstacles which, by the new postal
regulations, will be offered to the transmission of his famous periodical
to the colonies. He will be subjected to the annoyance of having to
put a penny stamp upon each of his numbers, besides the stamp of his
stamped edition, in order to send it to any British colony whatever,
except Canada. To go thither it must be loaded with two postage
stamps! That is, it must pay threepence, unless it goes by a conveyance
wholly British; in which case the exaction is a penny less, and the
transference occupies six weeks. Now Mr. Punch does not think, small
beer of himself, perhaps, but that is the opinion which may possibly be
entertained of him by those who get his journal in the condition of the
beverage alluded to when that has been drawn for more than a
calendar month. A of that fluid, the Newspaper Postage Act
which ſºciates the ºils, it emºrise the cºlonial postage of
newspapers, may be described as a half-and-half measure.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE COCHIN-CHINA CORRESPONDENCE.
S we have been re-
uested to publish
the subjoined cor-
respondence, and
as it relates to a
s too common griev-
ance in which the
peace of many
worthy families
is continually com-
romised, Mr.
| Punch cannot for
a moment hesitate
to do his best to-
wards the cause of
public and do-
mestic tranquillity.
Mr. Punch may
merely add, that
the correspon-
dence relates to
the encourage-
ment of a breed of
Fº - shame-
ully robbed by
the Chinese of
their, tails, and
cruelly, divested
of their mether
feathers - known
as Cochin Chinas.
The correspon-
dence, is that of
two ladies; and
is therefore characterised by a gentleness and forbearance truly feminine.
“Primrose Lodge, Clarence Park, June —, 1855.
“DEAR.MRs. BROOMBLossom, -May I as an acquaintance, and neighbour beg, to call
your attention to, your poultry? I assure you, the noise, is most distressing-particularly of
the male bird, or birds; for there must be half-a-dozen, though I am told, it is but a single
creature that makes all the disturbance. From the hour of day-break until the baker rings
with the rolls, that dreadful Cochin-China destroys the peace of my family. I am sure, dear
MRs. BRoom Blossom, that I have but to call your attention to this fact—our houses are, I
hope I may still say fortunately, so close, for you to make the noisy creature have compassion
upon us. “Ever yours, MARY MILLEFLEURs.”
“Minerva House, Clarence Park, June —, 1855.
“DEAR MRs. MILLEFLEURs, I am very sorry that the note of the poor bird should, in
any manner, distress the delicacy of your organisation, You know, dear Madam, or perhaps
might know, that it is one of the lates of natural history that chanticleer should salute the
rising morn. My bird does no more than follow the unerring statutes of instinct... If at this
season, Phoebus flames in his car at an early hour, the cock, which is sacred to Æsculapius,
who again is sacred to Apollo, must denote the event at a †. time...
“The poor bird is, I assure you, an especial favourite with all my young ladies, who would—
but for my vigilance-kill the dear creature with kindness. Let me, dear MRs. MILLEFLEURs
ask a little further indulgence for the dear Cochin. He has only been with us a month, and
I’m told in time one might sleep in St. Paul's belfry without ever hearing it strike midnight.
“Yours, sincerely, CAROLINE BROOMBLossOM.”
“DEAR MADAM, It is not for me to say to whom your Cochin is sacred. I can only, say
to us, it is a nuisance. Since half-past three this morning, neither MB. MILLEFLEURs-(and
he has to go in the City by ten, and your bird has made him this last week look as haggard as
a witch)—neither MR. MILLEFLEURs nor myself have closed our eyes. . - . . .
“I have no doubt, Madam, that your bird may be a favourite with your pupils, girls
knowing nothing of the responsibilities of life. But when the City has claims upon the head Q
a family,–I must say I do think it a little too hard that he should be deprived of his
matural rest, by a monstrous catarrh in feathers § MR. MILLEFLEURs calls your Cochin) from |
the moment of day-break. ...And talking of day-break, I’m sure the creature very ºn
takes the train for the car of Phoebus—as you it—for sometimes all night long—I can
hear him—he does nothing but crow against the railway whistle. ,
“Wishing to live at peace with my neighbours, it is no affair of mine whether your Cochin
is sacred to anybody—I can only say that, as f hear, it comes from the land of the heathen;
and whether or not that matters not—that any way it is unfit for any Christian hen-roost.
“Yours, sincerely, M. M.”
|
“MADAM, Minerva House is, happily, too well-founded upon a basis ºf Rock, to fear
either the sneers or the misrepresentations of common natures. As for the young ladies
entrusted by parental solicitude to my instruction,--I can only say that more than one
coRoNET-one coronet, Madam—is at the present hour to be found upon the fair brow of more
than one of my &lèves. (But I will not dwell on thus.)
l
“With respect to the Cochin bird, whose
place of birth you have-I have no doubt un-
willingly-misrepresented,—I have the pleasure
to inform you, that although of foreign extraction,
the creature is a British-born subject, being pro-
duced from a setting of eggs presented to my-
|self by Mrs. Major ShellDRAKE, who had her
setting from MRs. GENERAL BULLYRAGG, who
had her’s from her own daughter, the Lady of
the Bishop of HELIGOLAND-an individual as
distinguished for the curious rarity of his poultry,
as for the orthodory of his principles.
“I think, Madam, I have now most satisfac-
torily replied to you with respect to the origin
and country of the bird you have too h;
slandered, and remain,
“Yours, obediently, C.B.”
“MADAM,<-It is nothing to me where your
brute of a bird comes from, it is enough that
the whole neighbourhood is raised by it. MR.
MILLEFLEURs has done nothing, but turn, and
turn in his bed without a wink since 3, and
now gone to the City more dead than alive. I
have just received a note from him º that
he feels so ill, from want of sleep, that heihinºs
he shall be obliged to accept a hurried invitation
to go to Greenwich to dine.
“And so am I, a wife and mother of a family,
to be deprived of the society of a husband and
father, because you will keep what must be a
nuisance to all the neighbourhood, and a filthy
thing to look at besides 1
“It is not our wish to resort to * mea-
sures,--but we cannot be kept awake all night
by the shrieks of a foreigner, even though de-
scended from an orthodox bishop.
“Yours, M. M.”
“P.S. If your young ladies are so fond of
birds, the neighbourhood—MR. M. desires me
to say-will, no doubt, allow you to take out the
Cochin's weight in macaws, with even a peacock
:- 22
thrown into the bargain.
“MRs. BROOMBLossom presents her compli-
ments to MRs. MILLEFLEURs. MRs. B. can be
in no way in want ºf a macaw ; for she has only
to imagine MRs. M. reading one of her own
letters.
“Neither, has MRs. B. any wish to keep a
peacock at her own cost; seeing that she has
all .*. neighbour, whose vanity as much
exceeds that of the bird, as her pood looks ſall
short of it.
“MRs. B. has the further pleasure to mform
MRs. M. that early this morning one of her finest

respondence, can only hope that MR. MILLE-
FLEURs had a good night's rest. MR. Lyonsinn,

THE WATERY-GRAVE OF LONDON.
It is really beginning to be a very serious question, “What's to be
done with the Thames?” We wish that somebody would set it on
fire, and get rid of it at once. It is daily ; into the worst possible
odour; and, although many of us are continually drinking some of it to
the great danger of our lives, it is clear that we don’t drink enough of it
to get rid of it as rapidly as could be desired. Perhaps the best plan that
could be adopted, would be to get some of the most efficient Parliamen-
tary pumps to set to work upon it, after the termination of the Session,
when they might endeavour to exhaust the river, as they have already
exhausted the House of Commons by their long speeches. We are quite
sure that these instruments will be found the most efficacious in trying
to get rid of the water; for there is nothing º touch which they do not
render perfectly dry. ... If these means should ſail, we recommend the
river to the earnest attention of those persons who are fond of throwing
wet blankets upon anything like improvement; and who, by deriving
the moisture they require from the Thames, might eventually absorb the
disgusting liquid of which it is composed.
OUR ORGANISED HYPOCRISY.
You can’t get beer on a Sunday during those hours when you most
want it, but neither can you say your prayers in your own house in
the company of twenty persons beyond the members of your own house-
hold, unless you have written yourself down a dissenter, and also, if we
mistake not, paid half-a-crown. Moreover, although you can get beer
during some part of Sunday, you cannot say your prayers under the
conditions above specified during any. The same legislature that passed
the Sabbatarian Beer Bill last Session, has defeated LoRD SHAFTEs.
BURy’s Religious Worship Bill this. The Bill of Lord SmartEsbury
was a measure for preventing private houses from being closed against
conscientious worshippers; but true religion, to the canting impostors
who, from the love of spiritual tyranny, vote for Sunday Bills, is as
great an abomination as beer.
QUERY FOR THE SABBATARIANs.

would the pew.openers have been disqualified, from receiving their

SENTIMENTS FOR THE BOUDOIR.
BY MADAME PUNCH.
AIRLY cutting off
the wings of the
butterfly—such is
the attempt to de-
fine Love.
Love is the only
tyrant whose laws
are obeyed without
murmuring.
The woman who
succeedsinmaking
a fop love her,
prevents that ſop,
to an equal extent,
from loving him-
self. The prefer-
ence is not a very
flattering one.
Love is about
the only passion that has the power of making a man change his
character or his dress.
She is the most beautiful whom we love the most; and the woman
we love the most is frequently the one to whom we talk of it the
east. -
The melancholy of a disappointed lover is like the dead light that
burns over a tomb. - -
Íove is fed upon the lightest pastry—Friendship uponsolid beef.
To give to those who wantest un plaisir—to give to those we love
est un bonheur !
A Temperate Request.
Judging from the speeches at the recent meeting of the Maine Law
agitators, it would appear that those gentlemen are not quitº so tem-
perate in their demands as in their drinks, They require, it seems,
nothingless preposterous than the immediate total abstinence of the
whole ünited Kingdom—as if, for instance, it were possible, in any
amount of time, to teetotalise the cabmen!

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MR. PUNCH, having rushed from the House of Commons in an intense
fit of disgust, as mentioned by him last week, had, of course, to be
ropitiated, like Achill Es when he retired from the council-tent
{. Troy. He departed on the Thursday night, and earl
morning, as he was § on his back on the grass at #
inventing dozens of the most scorching and searing epigrams against
the whole political world, a Cabinet deputation, headed by LoRD
PALMERston, humbly approached him, and, with much earnestness of
supplication, begged him to return to town, and help the House
through the session. . Mr. Punch was for some time inexorable, but
the gentle influence of the sea-breezes (how unlike those of the poison
sewer that runs through London Bridge!) softened him, and, finally, he
imposed the condition, that John Russell should be instantly turned
out of the Cabinet, for his double-dealing in the Vienna affair. The
telegraph to John Russell that he must get out.
treated the whole
town together in time to catch the SPEAKER at prayers on
July 13th, Friday. There was not much done in either house, but SIR
| George GREY announced, that he had º ointed a commission, con-
| sisting of the three Recorders of London, Manchester, and Liverpool,
to inquire into the conduct of the police in the Hyde Park affair.
Monday. LoRD ALBEMARLE presented a petition, signed by 14,000 of
the inhabitants of Madras (which, for the information of members of
Parliament, it should be said, is a portion of India) complaining of a
great number of heavy grievances, among which was the Maturfa, an
extortionate tax on trades and professions; out of every pound of
which, moreover, the Government receives six and eightpence, and the
scoundrelly collectors the remaining fourteen and fourpence. His
lordship, deliberately, and upon the strongest evidence, charged the
boastful East India Company with gross and culpable neglect of their
i duties as rulers. He also showed that torture is used to collect the
Madras taxes. LoRD GRANVILLE's answer was rather an extenuation
than a defence.
LoRD PALMERSTON had kept his word with Mr. Punch, and in the
Commons LoRD John Russell announced that he had ceased to be
Colonial Minister. He made a speech, in which he set forth his own
merits, quoted SHAKSPEARE on hollow friendships, and professed con-
tempt for his own pretended friends, who would not keep him in office,
so as to bring down, the whole Ministry with him in his fall. SIR
| Bulwer Lytton withdrew the motion which he had threatened, but
intimated that the PREMIER was but an insincere party, and foºd
John a disingenuous one. LoRD PALMERSTON retorted, that SIR
| BULwer himself was either deliberately insincere, or as ignorant as a
child. MR. DisBAELI pleasingly characterised Lord Päiverston's
WOL. XXIX.
on Friday
erne Bay,
Premier eagerly agreed, and sent Bouveale running over to Sturry to
- Mr. Punch then
party to a bathe and shrimps, and they returned to
'speech as common-place bluster and reckless rhodomontade, and ended
by declaring his belief, that his lordship intended, during the recess, to
degrade the honour of the country, and betray its interests. -
BouvKRIE contributed to the harmony of the evening by making a
donkified speech about LORD John’s dazzling merits, whereat the
House roared, and MR. Roe BUCK expressed his opinion, that the dazz-
ling personage in question had not done his duty to the House, to
the country, to truth, or to honour. . A very pleasant, and personal
night was thus got through, and that nothing might be wanting to
sustain the character of the House of Commons, a Bill for paying
schoolmasters to instruct the poor of Scotland, was thrown out by
a considerable majority.
Tuesday, LoRD PANMURE explained that as War Secretary he º:
- - ut
# to have taken charge of our military dependency, the Ionian Isles,
| he really had so much to do, that he had determined to call that locality
a Colony, and hand it over to the Colonial Secretary. The Lords
thought this rather cool, but said nothin
In the Commons, the Rothschi LD tommittee reported that the
| BARON was not disqualified from being a member by being a loan-
monger.
MR. Roebuck then brought on his long-threatened motion of censure
upon the Administration under whose government the Crimean
disasters occurred. GENERAL PEEL moved “the previous question,”
: which is the House of Commons’ device for evading the pronouncing
any decision. The debate occupied two nights, this one, and Thursday,
—and there was a great deal of pretended earnestness as to the subject
of discussion, and a great deal of real party and personal asperity. SIR
JAMES GRAHAM thought the House ought to come to a decision; SIR
CHARLEs WooD thought that it had not information enough before it;
SIR ALEXANDER CockBURN put in some attorney-like pleas; LoRD
| John Russell insulted MR. Roe BUCK; M.R. BRIGHT slashed at LoRD
PALMERSTON; and SIR DE LAcy Evans complained of the PREMIER's
tone and manner; SIDNEY HERBERT thought with SIR JAMEs
GRAHAM; LoRD John MANNERs proved that he could not think at all
|LoRD PALMERston declared that he was a very fine Minister, and ali
his colleagues were very fine colleagues; and, “until more capable men
were ſound,” they would retain office; and MR. DISRAELI, with a
creditable sense of the gravity of the question, said that the House
after two nights' discussion, after the laborious efforts of the Šebastopol
Committee, and while the whole country was looking on with interest,
would come to a vote which could confer honour and credit neither
upon individual Members nor on the collective assembly.
| The House then came to such vote, and by a majority of 289 to 182,
declined to say whether LoRD PALMERSTON and his late and present
colleagues were guilty or not. -
The Maynooth Nuisance, looked as if we should hear no more of it
until, next year, for the debate was adjourned until that day three
months, but the Pºiº old Spoon ER brought it up again on
Friday, and carried a motion for inquiring why the report, on May-
nooth gave the Roman Catholic Bishops their “aggression” titles. The
Government opposed him, but was beaten by 97 to 76.
Wednesday. The Commons did a little business rationally.' ...
In the Lords on Thursday, the unlucky Scotch Education Bill was
finally strangled. The opposition was so strong that the mover wished to
º the bill, but this being objected to, its friends determined to con-
ceal the relative numbers, and, a §. being taken, everybody º
the mover voted against the second reading, the result being 86 to 1.
This is a victory for the Scotch priests.
Friday. LoRD LYNDHURST showed up the short-comings of the
Government in regard to legal reform, and the Chancellor in defence
laid everything upon the war, though what CRANNY has had to do
|with the war it is hard to say, or what share the wool-sack takes in
preparing for the sack of Sebastopol. He had better have minded his
| own business, and improved the Divorce Law and abolished the
| Ecclesiastical Courts.
| In the Commons, LORD PALMERSTON explained, that though we had
settled the first and second points with Austria, it was only done pro-
visionally, and we were not bound by our agreement—also that CHARLEY
NAPIER, when offered a Bath Cross, had crossly told the messenger
to go to Bath.
| A piece of good news was elicited from SIR BENJAMIN HALL. A
| clause is to be introduced into the Metropolis Management Bill, pro-
viding that after five years from Christmas next, no more sewage is
to go into the Thames; in the meantime other receptacles are to be
constructed for the horrible matter which now pollutes the stream.
Christmas 1860 is to be the end of the existing hideous state of things.
The authorities are desired to take notice, that Mr. Punch, the undying
and the ever vigilant, has noted the date, and will attend on new West-
minster Bridge, on Christmas Eve, 1860, to receive their report that
the Thames is pure.
The resolution for guaranteeing the interest of the Turkish Loan met
with a variety of unexpected opposition, and a result, which might have
imperilled the French alliance and the fortunes of the war, was avoided
by a majority of three only in a House of 267 members. So much for
the wisdom of Parliament'

IN COVENT GARDEN.
HE Russians are victorious; we are
fairly beaten, and it is nothing
more than common candour to
own our discomfiture. MR. GYE
has been the prime means of in-
troducing the Muscovites into the
very heart of the Metropolis; and
whether we will or no, we must
own their mastery. We will, how-
ever, as plainly as our emotion
will permit us, give a brief narra-
tive of the catastrophe.
On the evening of the 19th
inst., between seven and eight, it
was plain that an attack was to
be made. The Russians had, by
some means, taken possession of
Covent Garden Theatre. The
English, however, thronging the
house, resolved to dispute the
ground, inch by inch.
At eight o'clock precisely, GE-
NERAL Costa, with his truncheon
in hand, rode into the orchestra,
and was received with heavy
rounds, which he received with the
self-possession and true modesty
of a true hero. The orchestra
opened from the overture battery, and never did we witness such
#. such brilliancy, and precision of fire. They carried all before
them.
The fight raged from half-past eight—with but two brief intervals—
until nearly a quarter to one, when the star of Russia–La Stella del
Nord—was hailed as star triumphant. It is impossible for us, although
subdued and led away captive by the power of FleLD-MARSHALL MEy-
ERBEER, to suppress the expression of our admiration, our veneration for
the genius of that little, great man (for in corporal presence we think he
hardly tops NAPOLEoN or WELLINGTON). The subdued people flung
bouquets and garlands at his feet,_the giant of music!
But how admirably was the genius of the General seconded by the
enius of his forces ! Prodigious was the energy of Pietro Micaeloff
ormes; magnificent the power of the Cossack Corporal Gritzenzo
Jablache. (He fought on foot; we can therefore, give no idea of the
horse that could carry him). How gracefully, how skilfully did Danilowitz
Gardoni bring up his forces, setting them in the most brilliant array.
Especially mighty in their grace and sweetness were the Amazons who
took the field. How shall we describe Catterina Bosio, flashing hither
and thither, and wherever she appeared, subduing and taking prisoner
all about her. And then, that Prascovia Marai–with an innocent face:
a face like a flower, yet so invincible wherever she appeared. Unerring
sharp-shooters were the Vivandières, Eclinnona Bauer and Natalia
Rudersdoff-picking off unerringly whatever they aimed at.
Finally, the triumph of the Russians at Covent Garden is all to
nothing the greatest victory the Russians have had in the present war.
#. can be no doubt that GENERALISSIMo Gye will “sack” all
On 010n.
THE RUSSIANS
Among the distinguished visitors who were present at this Russian
victory, we noticed the EARL of ABERDEEN, MR. GLADstone, and
Messrs. Cobden, BRIGHT, and MILNER GIBSON. We heard that
LoRD JoHN RUSSELL occupied a box; but if so, he sat so far back
in the shadow—that we cannot conscientiously say we saw him.
THE NEW LAW OF LIMITED.LIABILITY.
SINCE the difficulty of defining a Traveller has become such a serious
nuisance to the Public, it is as well to provide against any further doubt
in any future enactment, and we therefore call on Par iament.to say,
whether the following cases will fall under the new Act.
º person sits in a draught, will the bill limit his liability to take
cold :
If an individual hires a Cab, will the new law limit his liability to be
overcharged and abused?
If a man goes into a Chancery suit, will the proposed enactment limit
his liability to be ruined by the lawyers?
When these points are clearly settled, we may perhaps find a few
more to propose.

PARLIAMENTARY NIGHT-WORK.
LoRD MAYok, Moon while very properly directing his attention, to
the filth in the Thames, has rather improperly expressed a hope. “that
the matter will be at once taken up by Parliament.” Surely Parliament
has quite enough dirt on its hands just now, without adding the mud from
the T. to the heap of nuisances with which it has had to deal, and
still has to dispose of. The progress of legislation has been slow
enough, but if at this period of the year Parliament should go into the
|Thames, we may expect the legislative machine to stick in the mud for
the short remainder of the session. We do not agree with the Lord
MAyor in calling on either house to act as a dredger for the purpose of
“taking the matter up,” and we prefer leaving the mud in the hands of
ration, who will know how to deal with it. As Conservator
of the Thames it is peculiarly the province of the Lord MAYoR to go
into the matter, and probe it to the very bottom; though we confess
we cannot fairly expect his Lordship to get over head and ears im-
mersed in the very unpleasant business.
The New Doorkeeper of the House of Commons.
SIR Edward BULweR Lytton has appeared lately in the new
character of a doorkeeper of the House of Commons, and in that
capacity he has been holding the door open for LoRD JoHN RUssell,
saying to his Lordship, in a tone of the most satirical blandness, worthy
of Pelham in his best kids, “This way Out—this way Out, my Lord!”
However, he has experienced the greatest difficulty in making Lord
John, who has grown rather short-sighted since the Vienna conference,
see the door.

SOULS SOLD BY AUCTION.
UR old friend, the Morning
Herald, enablesus to state
that the following dis-
course will be delivered in
the course of the present
month from the Pulpit,
by the REVEREND MR.
MMERs:– “Reverend
Gentlemen and Ladies,
allow me to introduce to
#. notice the Rectory of
usband Bosworth, eli-
gibly situate in a pleasant
part of the county of
Leicester. The lot of the
reverendº beg
your pardon—of the pur-
chaser's presentee, will be
cast in one of the pleasant
places of that celebrated
county — celebrated for
sheep of a superior breed,
much admired for the
wool; capital shearing to
the Pastor. Income"de:
rived from no less than
five hundredacres of land.
and amounts to one thou-
sand pounds per annum
exclusive of large and
superior parsonage house.
Population one thousand;
splendid business in cure of souls-souls cured at a guinea per soul. Incumbent
fifty-five years of age; human life precarious: many gentlemen die at fifty-five.
W. shall we say for this eligible tory? Situate in pleasant places; what
will any gentleman or lady give for this Rectory?, Eligible—and the present
incumbent fifty-five. Full fifty-five years of age—and life transitory–and situate
in pleasant places. What shall we say? Shall we say twenty thousand pounds?
Ten?, Five? Shall we say five? Five thousandº: a thousand a-year.
Qne thousand souls and only five thousand pounds. Five pounds a soul, and a
thousand pounds yearly return: capital º! in five years. Will nobody give
five thousandpounds? Four? Three? Two? (Thank you, my Lord.) Two thousand
pounds are bid for this first-rate Rectory of only one thousand souls, situate in
leasant places and yielding one pound per soul per annum. And the present
ncumbent fifty-five years of age. And one thousand pounds per annum. And
human life transitory. Three thousand. (Thank you, Ma'am). Three thousand
pounds for the Rectory of Husband Bosworth–eligible family Rectory-going at
three thousand. Only three thousand—and one thousand pounds per annum.
Three thousand pounds only, and the cure of no more souls than one thousand.
Probable Dissenters among the souls, and proportionate reduction of Jabour. Only
three thousand pounds bid for this sumptuous living. Going at three thousand
pounds...And fifty-five years of age; and human life transitory. Transitory human
life and fifty-five years º age, and going at three thousand pounds. Going at three
thousand-going-going—f Gone!” -
R. HAMMERs will also sell the Rectory of Simpson, “most pleasantly situate
within a mile and a half of Stoney Stratford (so called, as the reader knows, on
account of the fleas), five miles from Woburn, and fifteen minutes' walk of the
Bletchley station on the London and North Western Railway.” The living is worth
two hundred and fifty pounds a-year, with parsonage-house; and the incumbent of
Simpson is nearer to his grave by twenty years than the parson of Husban
Bosworth, being five over three-score and ten. The Rectory of West Lydford,
Somerset, will also be knocked downto some speculative person by MR. HAMMERs.
“The living is worth four hundred and fifty pounds a-year,” but “the vendor's right
to present is subject to the contingency of a lady, aged sixty-three, dying in the
lifetime of the present, rector, whose age is eighty-three.”. MR. Hºrſes will
probably expatiate, with his accustomed eloquence, on any infirmities on the part
of this venerable clergyman, which are likely to prevent him from attaining to the
age of OLD PARR. Houghton-on-the-Hill will also be submitted by MR.HAMMERs to
| public competition: “the income of this Rectory, two hundred and sixty pounds per
annum, is of the most satisfactory kind, arising entirely from the rents of lands,
and not from tithe-rent charge.” . The living man of whom, dead, the shoes are to
be waited for in this instance, is aged seventy-six. It is perhaps unnecessary
to add, that MR. HAMMERs is not himself in the Church, and that the pulpit
whence, he will address his congregation is one without a sounding-board, and one
from which the orator is not accustomed to hurl denunciations against money-
| making and the love of ease.
The Thirsty Feast-Day.
INSTEAD of creating a disturbance by reason of having been tormented with
drought on a Sunday by the Sabbatarians through their Beer Bill, it might answer
the purpose of respectable mechanics simply to lie down in the streets, having
| chalked on the pavement beforethem the brief buttouching inscription, “I am thirsty.”

WHY ABUSE THE THAMESF
It is really very unfair of everybody to be always abusing
poor old. Father Thames, who was originally a clean,
respectable, well-conducted river, until we rendered him
what he is by throwing dirt at him and into him, on all
and from all hands. Father Thames may well turn round
upon, the public and exclaim, in the words of Norma
(English version).
“See the wretch that thou hast made me.”
For it is the public to whom the river is indebted for all
the filth it contains. Not only do we pitch into it every-
thing in the shape of refuse, but we are continually
“pitching into it” in the more familiar and pugilistic
sense of the words. We might just as well throw a
quantity of rubbish into our neighbour's garden, and then
begin abusing the poor garden as a nuisance, for which,
after all, the remedy is in our hands. How can we expect
the Thames to wear anything but black looks under the
treatment to which it is exposed, for we should all of us
wear a somewhat lowering aspect if we were to be per-
petually made a target for all the dirt that the Metropolis
contains.
An Unlucky Day.
The Morning Herald lately said:
“The PREMIER has stated that Friday, the usual supply day, shall
not be a supply day."
No! Has Lord PALMERSTON become so superstitious?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IT was an elderly Whitebait,
In a Greenwich boatman’s well,
On his way to the fatal kitchen
Of the Trafalgar Hotel.
Around him in countless thousands,
His hapless fellows press'd, . .
And he knew the batter was mixing
Wherewith they should soon be dress'd.
And as the well-boat pass'd under
The Trafalgar windows wide,
He might see the parties feeding
On his brethren of the tide
By his side swam an ancient Flounder,
Oh, heavily swam he,
Of the water-souché thinking,
Where sodden he soon should bel
You might see the steam-boats landing
Their crowds at the Greenwich pier,
But little, I ween, those faces green
Betoken'd of diner's cheer.
Oh! pale to be seen, or a sad sea green,
Were the parties that sped away,
From sewer-stain’d flood, and sewer-soak’d
mud, - - -
Over Greenwich pier that day!
Then loud laugh’d the elderly Whitebait,
And his silvery tail wagg'd clear,
As º mark'd the hue, betwixt green and
ue,
Of each river-sick passengere.
And he turn'd to the ancient Flounder
That flopper'd at his side,
And with cheerful grin, 'neath his belly fin,
He poked him, and gaily cried:–
THE WHITEBAIT'S REVENGE.
“Cheer up, cheer up, old Flounder,
And bear a stiffer tail;
He 's no true fish that for dredge or dish
Turns dull in a single scale. -
“The flour it is spread for my death-bed,
The pan hisses hot for me;
By cruel men I’m doom'd to Cayenne,
And devill'd I soon shall be
“But a fig for the smart and for Mr. Hart—
... I die as my fathers died;
Ne'er a Whitebait yet of my family,
But in batter he was fried.
“I was bred by my sire to face the fire,
And the lemon-juice so keen;
And calm to confront the scorching brunt
Of the batterie de cuisine.
“Then if Whitebait can die so merrily,
Oh, why should Flounder dread
In souché of water, to perish a martyr
On a verdant parsley bed:
“Our friends of old no comfort had
In the batter as they lay,
Save the thought of the bill their devourers
Would certainly have to pay—
“Save the thought of the bill, and how very ill,
From cold punch and iced champagne,
The gents who dined would probably find
Themselves, when they º: the train;
“But thou and I, and our family-fry
Have a friend our sires ne'er knew,
In the nausea that rides the Thames’ ranktides,
Which to eat us folks pass through.
“Oh, rank and rich, from the tidal ditch
The stink comes steaming up!
And well I wot there's more headache in that
Than in punch or claret-cup.

A LOWE STYLE OF LOGIC.
IN speaking on MR. Roebuck's motion, MR. Low E is reported to
have said—
“Why, the House of Commons was now asked whether it would not pass a vote of
censure on the Government of this country, and on the EMPERoa of THE FRENch.”
But MR. Roe BUCK proposed to the House of Commons to censure
the late Administration for “the sufferings of our army during the
winter campaign in the Crimea,” on the ground that the conduct of
that Administration “was the first and chief cause of the calamities
which befell that Army.” . The EMPEROR OF THE FRENch in no way
contributed to the starvation and gelation of our brave soldiers, except
by not insisting that they should not accompany his own. How he
could have done that, we would thank M.R. Low E to inform our readers,
and should also be glad if MR. Low E would explain to the world by
what means Louis NAPOLEON could have become acquainted with our
extreme want of military organisation.
MR. Roe BUCK's motion is, in MR. Lowe's opinion, a vote of
censure on the EMPEROR or The FRENCH, MR. Low E must consider
MR. Roe BUCK as calling upon the House of Commons to declare that
Louis NAPOLEON ought to have been cognisant of our defective
military organisation, and of the want of concert existing between the
Treasury, the War Office, the Board of Ordnance, and the Admiralty ;
that it was his place to represent these circumstances to the British
Government, and to protest that he would be no party to the
destruction of 13ritish troops by cold, and want of food ºil. and
shelter, at the side of the well-cared-for and comfortable French. -
in case he had interfered in our affairs by any such representation, he
would have been credited ; and as if, moreover, he would not have been
invited to mind that business to which the condition of the French
army last winter proves him considerably more capable of attending
than the ABERDEEN Society were of managing theirs. No, MR. Lowe,
the condemnation of Louis NApoleoN is not involved in a vote of
censure on the BALACLAVA MINISTRY.
A CHAPTER witHouT AN END.—The Cathedral Chapter crying out
as usual for more Bishops.
As if,
RESPECTABLE RASCALS.
WE are really beginning to be afraid of everything in the shape of
respectability, for recent events have shown us, that the shape of
respectability may very P. include the form, alone without the
substance. The cloak of religion seems to be nothing, better than an
extensive wrap-rascal, and we are afraid that we should find the garb
of piety very often little better than a sort of moral Mackintosh thrown
over the loose habits of the wearer. One of the latest instances of
respectable rascality is that of a pious prig who has collected subscrip-
tions for a number of ragged schools, and pocketed the proceeds. This
gentleman will probably confess the weakness of the flesh, allude to
the human race in general as poor worms, and after a few ebullitions
of cant, will no doubt be received again with open arms by his puri-
tanical brethren, and with º pockets by his unfortunate victims.
We wish that the public would open their eyes instead of their purses
to those pious impostors, who are getting just now “as plentiful as
blackberries,” or, more appropriately speaking, “as thick as thieves.”
The Rose and the River.
THE River doth offend the nerves
Which sense affords to noses:
The Thames, which the LoRD MAYOR conserves,

A RUSSIAN MALADY.
THE CzAR has been said to be in a decline. This rumour has been
contradicted; but, whether ALEXANDER is in a decline or not, it is
tolerably certain that his Empire is in a consumption.
MUSCOVITE HOLINESS.
GoRTsch Akoff talks of “Holy Russia.” Let us hope that the Allied
rifles will make the Russian savages “more holy than righteous.”

“DEAR CHARLEY, -Let by-gones be by-gones: you shall have a shy

shall have a beautiful fleet of gun-boats—(the timber is already marked
for cutting in the New Forest)—and then you shall goin, my brave old
boy, and smash the windows of the CzAR's Winter Palace, and pick
up a bit of prize-money in St. Petersburg. . How I should like to see
one of your barns ornamented with doors of malachite!. How I should
like to see (and we all shall see it) the spread eagle nailed like a weasel
over those doors! -
“By the way, CHARLEY, there is to be an Institute of the Order of the
Bath; we are all anxious that you should have your bit of ribbon.
You have no objection, I suppose, to meet BERKELEY (we must give him
his bit; for he has worked very hard in his chair at the Admiralty),
and so come and take your decoration (the Earldom will keep for a
year or two; but that must come when Cronstadt has gone), and, if I
can get an open day, we’ll have a snug little dinner at the Reform.
When I say snug, I mean without any of the press-gang present to
collar every syllable of the conversation.
“Ever yours, dear CHARLEY, PAM.
“P.S.. I've a new conundrum to tell you. I made it, the other
night whilst Roßbuck was firing away, and giving notice of impeach-
ment. By the bye, I’ll give it you now. Why is Tower Hill like
HATCHETT's f There.”
CHARLEY TO PAM.
“My LoRD,-As for your bit of blue ribbon, I wouldn't say black's
the white of my eye for it. Instead of a bit of ribbon, I only wish HER
Most GRAcious MAJESTY (God bless her, and long may she reign!)
would put a rope's end into my hand, with leave to use it all round her
Cabinet. My dear eyes! wouldn't I give some of ye a starting!
“Never mind—I shall be alongside of you yet in the House; for you
can’t stand long; must go to bits, and then may I be—but you know
what I mean. And you think I’m to be bamboozled by another
dinner, when you’ve your gammoning-tacks aboard. Just take a round

find me a lion, an old sea-lion yet, and so I just give you warning,
take care of my teeth, and keep clear of the lash of my tail. Your
Disobedient Servant (to command), Charley.”
THE Movement IN c. (pivision).-We see MR. HULLAH has just

AIRY AND LITERARY.
“It is in contemplation to lay down tubes from the General Post office to various
parts of Lºndon, and through them to propel the letter-bags by means of atmospheric
pressure.
EveRY hour of our lives, in this wonderful age,
me bran new invention our thoughts will engage;
And the last (which I think leaves the others behind)
Is to give to our letters the wings of the wind.
'Neath our streets Row LAND HILL has contracted, they say,
Large tubes, cheek by jowl with the gas-pipes, to lay;
Through which all our letters as swiftly will speed 'em,
As the gas by whose light we’re enabled to read 'em.
These letters, perhaps, I need scarcely explain,
By the force of air-pressure will fly through the main,
For which kind of propulsion, 'tis clear VIRGIL meant his
Expression “Jactata per acquora centis.”
Come then sturdy Notus, and blustering Eurus,
From all chances of failure assist to secure us;
Qn Foreign Post nights lend a favouring gale;
And provide a Monsoon for each Overland Mail.
Blow! Blow!, Wintry Wind, in those tubes if you can,
And you’ll still be more friendly and kindly than man;
Though in wafting our letters your blast may be rude,
You must be an ill-wind to blow nobody good.
Soon! Soon! shall the Zephyrs and Rowland conspire
To feed the warm passion, and fan the soft fire;
For º: a letter from Master to Miss,
They’ll make quite as easy as blowing a kiss.
The merchant enraptured shall haste to prepare
Price currents to float on these currents of air;
And a blast of the Book Post shall do for the name
Of each author far more than the trumpet of Fame.
The timid perhaps may see reason to fear
That these tubes to the gas-pipes will still he too near s
And may dread lest some pestilent rate-seeking ass,
Should cut off the letters instead of the gas.
But one thought in the scheme all my confidence raises,
Its success is secured by our singing its praises;
For ’tis clear (and this maxim you can’t frust enough in)
It is just the invention to prosper by puffing.
JUSTICE IS (DIS)SATISFIED.
LQRD CAMPBELL complains that the people of Kensington are prac-
tically two days off from the delivery of their letters through the Post
Office, because everybody (in Kensington) leaves home at 9 A.M., and,
as the letters are not delivered until half-past 9, and as nobody (in
Kensington) thinks of looking at a letter when he returns home at
night, everybody, (in Kensington) is two days behind hand in corres-
pondence with the world in general. This perhaps accounts for the
alleged dulness of the Kensingtonians, who, as a body, have sometimes
been considered the “know-nothings” of the Metropolitan suburbs. As
a promise has been made to accelerate the postal communication with
Kensington, we may expect that the wits of the inhabitants will be
correspondingly quickened. For our own parts, we have found this
secluded people to be a race of at least average intelligence; and,
though the Mail may be dilatory, we donot think the people themselves
deserve to be considered as slow coaches. If the correspondence is not
delivered in due time, we would suggest that the blame should be
thrown on the º quarter; and that, if the letters are improperly
#º the words litera scripta manet should be inscribed over the
Os ce.
The opera Bank of England.
THE Morning Chronicle says:—
“The Italian Opera House in the Haymarket has been named as the probable locale
of the new West End Branch of the Bank of England.”
If, by some magical process of †: and “prospecting,” all the
precious metal buried in the Opera House might be once again pro-
duced, there would be ready money enough, and to spare, for all the
purposes of the branch bank, without any supply from the city trunk.

WHO IS A TRAVELLER P
THE evidence given by the London magistracy before the Sunday

papers. Very many interesting and most suggestive questions, with
the most pregnant and instructive replies, have been wholly suppressed,
and others sadly garbled. For instance, SIR Robert CARDEN, Alder.
man, has by no means had justice done to him. It is true that he was
faithfully reported when he declared his desire to introduce everywhere
the Maine Liquor Law; he himself standing apart from the operation
of the enactment. SIR Robert, we understand, would not only close
every public-house for ever and for ever, (the City companies have their
own cellars), but would condemn every publican, in penance for his past
sins, to work gratis at any fire-engine required by any fire. SIR Robert
himself is worthy of being appointed turncock to creation, for his evi-
dence was “one wishy, washy, everlasting flood” of water-Thames:
water. There is an over piety at which decent people are fain to hold
the nose. Towards the conclusion of SIR ROBERT's evidence the com-
mittee indulged in copious lustrations of eau-de-Cologne; and, at; its
termination it was found necessary to fairly sluice the committee-room
with vinegar before continuing the proceedings. However, we have
noted the error of omission in certain points of evidence delivered by
Police Magistrates, and shall proceed to supply them.
Bow STREET ExAMINED.
By the Chairman. Do you consider a swallow a traveller?
Bow Street. Certainly not.
Chairman. No Why, it is known, that the swallows, following a
certain law, leave us every fall, and return every spring. Surely,
swallows are travellers? /
Bow Street. I should not hold them travellers. If they go abroad, it
is for their own pleasure; and to travel for pleasure, cannot be—as I
should interpret the act—bond fide travelling.
By Mr. Williers. As we have touched upon the lower range of
animal life, do you consider a honey-bee a traveller?
Bow Street. Certainly : because a honey-bee is out upon business;
and therefore I should think it wrong to shut up all the flowers, the
whole of the Sunday against him. I think, however, with my friend
SIR RoRERT CARDEN that, on the Sabbath, it would be a pious example,
if even the bees carried on their occupation without singing: the same

righteous people, on their way to and from church, much scandalised by

traveller P
Worship Street. By no means.
By the Chairman. State your reasons to the Committee.
Worship Street. A bond fide traveller is a traveller far away from his
usual place of abode. Now, the Sea Serpent cannot, I humbly suggest,
be a traveller; because anywhere in the ocean the Sea Serpent must
be considered quite at home. (Sensation.)
LAMBETH STREET ExAMINED.
By the Chairman. You are a reader of SHAKspeAREP.
Lambeth Street. I have some knowledge of that individual.
By the Chairman. Do you know Puck 2
Sadler’s Wells.
By Mr. Williers. Do you consider Puck a bond fide traveller?
Lambeth Street. That very much depends upon his occupation at the
time.

which the fairy king Oberon commands Puck to fetch him that “little
western flower P” The flower—
“Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
And maidens call it love-in-idleness?”
You remember Oberon's commission? He bids Puck hence:
“Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again,
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.”
The passage is familiar to ſº f
Lambeth Street. It is. If I may trust my memory (for I confess, I
have not a very, very good memory)—Puck makes answer-
“I’ll put a girdle round about the earth
In forty minutes.”

should you not consider Puck a honºfile traveller?

travel for business; but the journey undertaken by Puck for his master

PUNCH'S ILLUSTRATIONS TO SHAKSPEARE,
KING CLICQUOT'S EQUILIBRIUM.
WRITING from Berlin the other day, the
Correspondent of the Morning Herald somewhat
startles us by stating:—
“Whatever may be thought of his late vacillating policy
it cannot be disputed that the balance of power is now
resting mainly in the hands of FREDERick of PRussia
the position which he occupies being now more than ever
. essential towards preserving the due equilibrium of
urope.
Whatever may be thought of it by persons not
so well informed, we ourselves have long ex-
pressed but one opinion as to KING CLIcquot's
“late vacillating policy;” namely, that it has
proceeded chiefly from those exciting causes
which lead from physical to mental vacillation,
and create a staggering of mind as well as body.
With all submission therefore to so (frequently)
eleyated a personage, we must confess a doubt
as to his having the balance of power still resting
in his hands. , Simply since, we fear, from
Vinous agency, his hand has grown so shaky,
that...whatever, he may once have held must
inevitably by this time have slipped through his
fingers.
In all soberness indeed, we question if KING:
Clicquot can in any way, be looked to for
“preserving the due Equilibrium of Europe,”
seeing it is quite as much as he can do just now
to keep his own.

BOLD REFORM OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE.
WE are in a position to announce, that HER, MAJESTY's Government,
having carefully considered the question of Administrative Reform, are
about to introduce a radical change into every department whatever of
what can in any sense be denominated public service, the Church and
the learned professions being included under that head. .
It has appeared to Ministers, that the present system of conferring
degrees and granting diplomas according to proficiency, as tested by
examination, is no longer tenable. They propose, therefore, to put an
end to it in the most expeditious possible manner. They do not intend
to deprive the Universifies of Oxford, Cambridge, London, Edinburgh,
Glasgow, Dublin, the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, and the
Society of Apothecaries, of the i. already vested in them, to confer
honours and licences on those who choose to present themselves to
them for examination. But they design to extend to other and more
practically competent judges of scientific and professional ability the
#: creating graduates, licentiates, and professors at their simple
creulon.
The Cabinet for the time being is to be authorised to appoint
such as they, shall esteem eligible persons, not *} to the digni-
ties of Bachelor and Master of Arts, and Doctor of Law, Physic,
Music, and Divinity, but also to the actual vocations and callings of
barrister, proctor, prothonotary, attorney, physician, surgeon, and
apothecary, with ſi power to practise on the persons of HER
§. subjects, and in her courts, ecclesiastical and civil.
Ministers will . be empowered to select any person or persons for
the service of the Church, and Bishops will have, to ordain such
candidates at the peril of incurring the pains and penalties of a
praemunire. As this arrangement is precisely that according to which
the Bishops themselves have been consecrated by the Deans and
Chapters, they will be unable to offer any reasonable objection to it;
besides, if a Premier is capable of . of the fitness of a parson to
be a Bishop, much more is he able to determine if a layman is fit to be
a darson.
t is clear to the meanest capacity, that if Ministers can be trusted to
select men for diplomatic service without ºl. of them the pro-
duction of any . they may safely be allowed to constitute indi-
viduals, in whose skill, knowledge, and judgment they have confidence,
medical men in the same manner. For a medical diploma places a
comparatively small number of lives at the mercy of a practitioner;
i.. state-diplomatist has the welfare and existence of millions in his
The #. of which the above is an outline, will be shortly submitted
to Parliament. There is little doubt that it will become law. The
agitation out of doors on the subject of Administrative Reform renders
it necessary that something shall be done. Every one sees that one
uniform principle should govern the appointment to all offices involving
the public weal. This can be managed in two ways: one to throw
open all employments to competition, the other to dispose of them all
by nomination. No doubt the latter will be the more acceptable to
gentlemen whose seats in Parliament have cost them large sums of
money.

Here at least the female cormorants may “peg

advertisement we find the amiable dodge resorted
to, and the re-opening of the school is announced
by the intimation that the “young friends will
re-assemble on the –th instant,” while an
allusion is happily thrown in as to the extent
of the "..." ect.” We recollect going to see
a boy who had been sent to a school on the
coast, on the strength of a glowing description
of the “sea view; ” but on inquiry we found
that this marine luxury was only to be obtained
from the top of one º the tallest chimneys of

not allowed the entrée, after the act for the
abolition of climbing boys had come into
operation.

himself not to get too fat, or does he intend to

upon the over-corpulency of the inmates of the
establishment.
We might continue our specimens of scholastic
advertisements through several columns of our
publication; but we must be satisfied with one
more illustration of the yariety of modes of supply
with which the demand for education is met at
the present season. The instance to which we
allude is an offer to barter a given quantity of
learning for a given quantity of grocery, and to
exchange so much Latin and Greek for so much
tea and sugar. Of course, if a batch of Twankay

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
July 23, Monday. The “Religious Worship Bill” (as it is entitled, in
order to show that it does not refer to Mammon-worship, or any other
recognised forms of British devotion), having been re-constructed,
passed the Lords. The EARL or DERby still showed himself greatly
interested in it, and was eager to know, “whether it would prevent
divine service from being carried on in the ball-room of an inn.” His
lordship has, it is understood, a curious plan for combining race-balls
and religion; and he intends to officiate as something between Steward
and Deacon, and to stand at the door, for the collection, holding one of
the plates his horses have won. -
In the Commons the Nuisances Removal Bill was read a third time
and passed. It is to be hoped that it will be amended in the Lords, to
the extent of a clause suppressing Street Cries, which are represented
to Mr. Punch as . great part of London quite uninhabitable.
This crying nuisance ought not to be forgotten. New writs were
moved, SIR WILLIAM Molesworth, through the happy release of
LoRD John Russell, having become Colonial Secretary, and SIR
BENJAMIN HALL, through ºº:: of his colleague, having be-
come Chief Commissioner of Works. MR. LAING expressed a wish to
have another debate on the Viennese Conferences, but LoRD PALMER-
ston told him that, there was no time for anything of the kind; and,
that if he had stayed in the House and minded his business, he would
have heard a great deal of discussion on the subject. The Turkish
Loan then came up again, and no opposition was offered to it, except
some speeches. MR. BRIGHT complained that the London press “brow-
beat anybody who spoke reasonably on the War.” He should not call
out before he is hurt—when he speaks reasonably on the War, we will
attend to him; meantime, as the explanation of the word “brow-beat,”
is “to assail with arrogant speech and dogmatic assertions,” we-but
surely MR. BRIGHT, though a Quaker, keeps such a vanity as a looking-
lass. MR. LAYARD urged the great º of supporting Turkey
in Asia Minor, and expressed his fear lest, the Russians should take
Kars. The majority of the Members had no idea what he meant, and won-
dered why the Russians might not take cars as we take cabs; but, when
he gave MR GLADstone a good castigation for “unstatesmanlike and
unpatriotic conduct” in trying, to defeat the loan, they were pleased.
In the course of the debate, GLADSTONE called himself one of the dii
minores; but, to the classical mind of Mr. Punch he more resembled
one of the dii selecti-by name Janus the double faced. Mr. PAir
wanted to know, how the Government intended to carry on the War, and
whether they intended to do it properly,
WOL. XXIX. F
to which Éaeornick Perils
replied, that they had intended to do it properly, and he would not tell
him how. A long squabble about the eternal Scotch Map succeeded;
and LoRD SEYMoUR charged Government with having “cheated” the
House into ordering a chart on a large scale for the convenience of the
landed #. of Scotland. LoRD JoHN RUssell, thinking the
subject had something to do with Magna Charta, was going to make a
speech, but was undeceived, and did not.
Tuesday. There was a small row in the Commons, as might have been
expected. . LORD PALMERSTON had done a bit of neat jockeyship. As
Mr. Punch mentioned, the week before last, the Irish members had been
compelled by their priests and the more ignorant, part of their con-
stituents, to threaten the Government with hostility if a mischievous
clause were not restored to the Tenants’ Compensation Bill. ... So PAM,
of course, put it back, and obtained Irish support against MR. RoeBUCK.
Then, danger being over, he throws over, also, the Tenants' Compensa-
tion Bill a together. Whereat the Hibernians made a clamour, being
regularly “done.”
A knot of selfish capitalists are º: the valuable measures by
which a comparatively poor man ma enabled to invest his capital
productively, without being exposed to ruin, as he is by the present
partnership law. LoRD PALMERston is fighting for the reform, very
manfully, and this day he beat the obstructives by two to one; and on
Thursday he told them that they might try, by all the forms of the
House, to prevent the nation from obtaining what it was felt would be
a great benefit, but if they liked to talk against time until September,
he would keep them at it, and then he beat them again by 121 to 40.
The House was counted out before dinner, and, APSLEY PELLATT
was reckoned up in it; the manly exercise of a Count being one in which
he is always mixed up, actively or passively. En revanche, on
Wednesday. APSLEY tried to resist the going into committee on the
Union of Contiguous Benefices Bill, and was beaten by 70 to 47. SIR
WILLIAM CHAY announced, that, he must withdraw his Church-rate
Abolition Bill for the session, as its opponents were availing themselves
of the forms of the House to get rid of a measure they could not resist
by argument. Twice, therefore, this week, men trying to do good
have broken their shins over the Forms of the House. If these forms
are not pushed up to the wall, out of people's way, Mr. Panch may
feel it necessary to order them out altogether.
Thursday. The Lords cut away at real business, the only discussion
being whether the Irish Constabulary ought to be employed for excise
.#. in regard to the sale of spirits. Decidedly the policeman's
staff and the gauger's, are two distinct things, and the former officer’s

business is with bangs, not bungs. Besides, spirits are often above
proof, but Mr. Punch has seldom heard of a policeman who was above
proving anything that he was ordered to prove.
In the Commons, MAJOR REED. asked LoRD PALMERSTON a very
#. question, namely, whether in the event of peace being made
uring the recess, he would call Parliament together, before ratifying
the terms. To which LORD PALMERSTON º with one of his best
pieces of courteous impertinence, namely, that if anything occurred
ºl. it necessary to call Parliament together, he should feel it his
uty to do so.
An Education vote of £296,521, making, with a previous vote, about
three hundred and eighty thousand pounds—all that England, with a
collected national revenue of sixty millions, can afford to spend on the
education of her children—was then taken, as was an Irish vote for the
same P. There was a debate in which rather more sense was
talked upon the subject than usual—which is perhaps not saying much,
the locality being remembered.
Friday. In the Lords, BROUGHAM came out again in his old! charac-
ter of “our HENRY.” He declared himself to be an attached friend of
the Church of England, and an opponent of Dissenters, but he intro-
duced a bill for sweeping away about 100 old penal acts, against
religionists of other convictions than his own.
In the Commons, MR. GLADSTONE renewed his attempt to embarrass
the Government and insult our French Ally, in reference to the Turkish
loan, but he was tackled by almost as subtle a logician as himself, the
Solicitor General, and may, “in the language of the Schools” (in which
le delights), be said to have cotched it rather. The desirability of a
d understanding between ourselves and the French was further
illustrated by the inability of the House of Commons to e upon the
meaning of the French word, by which it was intended to bind the
allies “severally.” The Loan, however, met with no successful
oppºsitiºn. - -
The Committee on the Sunday Beer Bill having reported that it
Qught to be altered, the preparatory steps were taken for that purpose.

CH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHAT TO EAT, DRINK AND AVoID.
------ E 'fancy, this question
which has often been
3|| #. through the me-
w º um of an advertise-
- ment, seems to admit
of an easy answer; for
we ought to eat nothing
drink nothing, an
avoid everything in the
shape of meat or drink,
while the present state
of things exists. The
evidence being...taken
before a Committee of
the House of Commons,
discloses some startlin
facts; and, indeed, it
will be impossible, for
anyone who reads it to
enjoy a single morsel of
any sort of food. Such
is the extent to which
adulteration is carried,
that we cannot get even
our drugs in a pure
state, and it is almost
as difficult to get an
honest black dose, as an
honest glass of port. It
is horrible to think that
we cannot even make sure of a “cup of cold pison” in a sound condition, for our
russic acid is diluted, and our laudanum is deprived of a large per centage of
its strength. Our bread, which is commonly considered the staff of life, has often
more life about it than is either wholesome or agreeable, for it is sometimes a
mass of animal matter; and we need scarcely be surprised at meeting a loaf which
has made its way out of the bread-pan, which might easily be the case, if there
were anything like unity of movement .."; the insects of which it is composed.
Among other expedients to increase the bulk of flour, is the mixture of a quantity
of chalk, so that it really requires a knowledge of chemistry to distinguish one from
the other; and, if we mix .. our crust with our slice of Cheshire, we may be
literally unable to tell the chalk from the cheese. - -
We were never very partial to sausages; nor is our tº. for them at all in-
creased by the discovery, that most of them are made of horses' tongues. It seems
from the evidence of Doctor THOMson, Professor of Chemistry, at St. Thomas's
Hospital, that the ultimate, destination of every horse's tongue is, that it shall be
in some form or other passed down a human throat. All of us have a tongue in
our heads, but we little thought we have taken, perhaps, three, or four horses'
tongues, into our system, in the deceitful guise of sausage-meat. We feel seriously
disposed after reading the evidence before the Committee, to turn vegetarians, or
total abstainers from everything in the shape of food. Even our tea, which we
thought was at the most a compound of sloe and birch-broom, is said to consist of
iron filings, and some stuff called catechū, which is more fit for a cat, to chew, than
for a human being to swallow. We wonder what the teatotallers will think of the
fact, that they have been consuming tons of iron, to say, nothing of the catechū
and the other messes, of which the cup that queers but not inebriates is found to
be composed.
A CHINESE INUNDATION.
THE last advices from Melbourne announce that 14,000 Chinamen have lately
walked into the colony with the º announcement that “all the rest are
coming after them.” Victoria is said to be in want of population, and the want is
now likely to be supplied with what is popularly termed “a vengeance.”. Some-
how or other the Chinamen are not received with much enthusiasm by the colonists,
and it is said that a law is to be passed to exclude the unwelcome strangers, though
it is evident that by shutting the door on the Chinese, the authorities would open
the door to a great evil, . One of the complaints against the Chinamen is, that they
take more than their fair share of water, which they probably require for their
tea. Victoria must be badly off indeed for rivers if it is apprehended that the
thirst of the Chinese will occasion a drought. We defy the most inveterate of tea-
totallers to get through more than his daily gallon of the element; and supposing
everyone of the 14,000 Chinamen to be able to gulp down the contents of a moderate
sized water-butt, there are surely sufficient sources from which this drain on the
aquatic wealth of the colony might be counterbalanced.
Perhaps when the colonial thirst for gold is accompanied by a thirst of a more
natural and wholesome character, the diggers will begin to think of digging for
water instead of digging per tually for the precious metal. It will be indeed a
sad, lesson to the money-grubbing population of Victoria if it should come to pass
ºte: in pints should prove a more really desirable acquisition than gold in
quartz.

A DESPOT IN GRAIN.
KING BoMBA is making himself disagreeable in his small
way. It is a small way as regards ourselves and our Allies:
for BoMBA cannot constitute himself a great nuisanceto any-
body that is not in his clutches, as poor PoERIo is, the
captive of this modern MEZENTſus. BoMBA is prohibiting
the exportation of grain to our forces in the Crimea; a line
of policy which, by fº all the mills in his dominions
ºil. grist, will render his despotism more grinding than
ever. Some time ago his sulphureous Majesty refused to
let us have any of his brimstone; and no doubt he persists
in withholding from us, that unpleasant but necessary
substance. Polyph EMUs had only one eye; but with the
half of that organ he would have been able to see what,
under existing circumstances, would be the best ºf to do
with such a łº, tyrant as the present ruler of the land
he lived in. It is to be wished that he were still extant, to
take this small sovereign by the nape of the neck, and
fling him either into Etna, or a league or two off Sicily
into the sea. Cannot England and France, between them,
in default of Polyphemus, contrive to pitch Bomba into
the middle of next week As to the grain which he has
the impertinence to deny us—why MR. Eisen BERG, sup-
ported by a British man-of-war, would very soon succeed
in extracting all his corns from him.
King Clicquot's Colours.
THE wits of FREDERICK WILLIAM have gone Berlin

no longer pass under the denomination of neutral tint; and
affairs in the quarter of Sans Souci are looking decidedly

THE CITY STATE COACH.
THIslumbering old machine seems to cost more than it is
worth, for it entails atax which nobody likes to pay, and unless
an arrangement is come to, the probability is, that the yehicle
will be torn to pieces by the hands of the bailiffs. We have
heard of horses eating off their own heads, and we may soon
expect to hear of a gilt coach that has eaten all its own gin-
gerbread. MR. Ex-LoRD MAYor. SIDNEY refuses to pay the
tax on the old vehicle, on the ground that he refused to ride in
it, because it shook him to death frightened him out of his

We have often pitied the Kings of the City, as we have seen
them well shaken when taken in the State Coach to Guildhall
and we have expected to see the REMEMBRANCER pitche

through the plate-glass panel on to the heads of the multitude.
We often wondered why the REMEMBRANCER's head was cased
in fur-so emblematic, of the ordinary muff-but we now per-
ceive that it is intended as a safeguard to that, official, whose

dashed or shaken out by the jolting of the state vehicle.
We confess our admiration of the wisdom which refuses to

pay any further tax on the LQRD.MAYor's Coach, which
ought to have gone out with Bartholomew Fair, Smithfield

THE ILL-USED POLICE.
THE police, who acted in so noble a manner on LoRD GROSVENOR's
Sundays out in Hyde-park, have been most shamefully scandalised. . It
is plain that a conspiracy has been formed against the members of the
§ , especially those important members lettered A. For instance,
one witness avows that he saw policeman A20 assault an old gentleman,
beating him on the head with a truncheon; whereas, if we are to
believe A 20 (corroborated by a brother or two of the force), it was the
old gentleman, or old ruffian rather, who assaulted A 20, beating him
on ſº. head with a kitchen poker. Again, 380A is accused of beating
a little boy with his truncheon across the back and shoulders; whereas
380 A is ready to produce the most damnifying evidence that it was the
brutal little boy who beat him We have no dºubtiº, that ere the
inquiry is ended it will be... that many of the policemen were most
terribly assaulted by females, mostly girls. Two cases of great cruelty
have come to our knowledge. One, that of a policeman six feet two
—a scintillation from the Emerald Isle—a purest ray serene from
Connemara—who is at this moment in bed, from a concussion of the
brain, inflicted by a young woman with a parasol. Another is suffering
from a broken collarbone, fractured by a fan. These offenders—they
have escaped for a time, but the police is on their track-are said to be
milliners' girls, employed in a fashionable house, famous for late hours;
and are therefore, with the unreasoning temperament of females, .
enraged against the aristocracy. It can be proved that one of these girls
called out to the Hon. Augustus FitzTIP, then on his bay hack,-"Go
to church!” in the boldest manner, adding “and I'll go with you.” ,
The police have evidently been very much scandalised; but at length
truth is about to prevail. Very providential has been the appearance
of a legal gentleman who here came forward to depose to the excessive
urbanity of the police; whilst, if we are to believe the testimony of a
clergyman now out of employment (will not LoRD GRosvenoR give
him a cure?) the truncheons of the police were rather pleasant, to con-
sider than otherwise. Indeed, like German sausages, you might have
eaten them: not truncheons of skull-cracking wood, but truncheons
cut in the land of promise, secreting milk and exuding honey. So much
has public opinion re-acted in aid of the libelled police that there is
some talk #; i. of rewarding the brave fellows with a Hyde Park
medal; bearing GBosvenoR's face on one side, and on the other an
empty hogshead. “GBosvKNOR's Sunday Out” will be engraven on

Aristocracy at a Discount.
THE titled classes seem to be falling in value, if we are to judge by
the announcement of A Shilling Peerage, which has recently been
followed by A Shilling Baronetage, and will probably lead to a Sixpenny
Knightage, with a Squirearchy at a still lower figure. We have been
told by WALPOLE that “every man has his price,” but when the whole
Peerage sells at a shilling, it is lamentable to reflect how low the
present price of humanity must have fallen.

HOW TO CLEAR THE KITCHEN.
OUR attention has been called to a new process of cooking by gas,
which may be considered a real advance in the art of Gas-tronomy.
One peculiarity of the arrangement is, that you may cook all your meals
at once, which will be an economy of fuel; and, of course, if you eat
them all at once, an economy of time will be effected. ...You may illu-
minate a leg of mutton, light up a chop, and throw a sufficient glare on
a steak, from one moderate jet of gas, to cook the whole in a very
satisfactory manner. Another remarkable advantage of the process is,
that you may turn your leg of mutton into a sort of chandelier, for you may
just as well hang up your apparatus to your ceiling, and you will thus
light your room and cook your meals at the same gaslight. It is true
that the gas-cooking apparatus will cook half a dozen things at once,
and thus, perhaps, accomplish the (sometimes desired) object of avariety
of flavour. We hail the invention as one that will give an impetus to
the culinary art, and ultimately enable every man to become his own
cook; so that he may use his own discretion about robbing himself by
selling the perquisites, instead of leaving it to that very doubtful
dependency—the honesty of his domestic.
PRUSSIA’S COACHMAN.
In a book of French Anecdotes we have met with the following:-
“Whilst the KING or PRUssia was talking with D'Alembert, a servant entered the
apartment. D'ALEMBERT seemed to be struck with his appearance, and, in truth, he
was a fine, tall, stalwart fellow, as handsome as any of FREDERick's grenadiers. “That's
the finest man in my kingdom,” said the King. ‘He was for some time my coachman,
and I seriously thought at one period of sending him as my ambassador to St.
Petersburgh.’”
Things have changed since then. Prussia has no longer, the whip-
hand of Russia. On the contrary, we rather think it is Russia, now
that drives Prussia. We only wish FREDERICK WILLIAM would try
the experiment of sending his coachman to St. Petersburgh. It is our
firm, opinion that ALEXANDER. would order, the, Çoachman back to
Berlin with orders “to take His Majesty a little drive to Siberia"
Lord John Russell's Coat of Office.
WE understand from a reliable eaves-dropper in Downing Street,
that the coat of office which Lord JoHN has lately left off wearing
will shortly be on view at NATHAN's the Costumier, it being foun
unsuitable for any but mere masquerading purposes. , We are told
indeed that it presents upon inspection a most party-coloured appear-
ance, one half being of a bright military scarlet, while the other shows
the sombre drab of the Peace Society. The coat, it is said, like the
head of its late wearer, bears very evident marks of having been half
turned within the last twelvemonth, and one of the sleeves has every
appearance of having been much laughed in.
The Courts of Hymen and Cupid,
THE Admiralty Court appears to be doing a strange sort of business,
According to the Times,
“The Court sat for a short time only, and disposed of motions and assignations."
DR. LushingtoN presided on this occasion. The same judge sits in

Affecting Anecdote,
SoME of the Russian prisoners, captured in the Kerteh affair, have
been brought to London. The other day they were taken upon one of
the bridges, that they might have a sight of the Thames. No sooner
did the odours of the river reach them, than they simultaneously uttered
a cry of deli ht, Asif at a nemo

so much so, that henceforth he renounces the Path-os and the Bath-os

A SONG OF SUMMER.
BY A SOLICITOR,
IsiNg of summer the delights,
Its cloudless days, its balmy nights:
The time when Sol his fiercest burns,
And the Assizes' heat returns.
\ Now by the side of placid brook
The angler plies his sharpest hook;
But they in Court for fees who dangle,
Show more acuteness in their angle.
Now, too, with hand all quick for catches,
At LoRD's the cricketer plays matches;
But when a Lord’s in Chancery caught,
There’s more excitement in the sport.

'Tis sweet in summer-time to hear
The skylark singing, loud and clear:
Yet sweeter’tis the charge to stºº,
“Attending hearing—Sir-and-eight.”
'Tis sweet to contemplate the play
Of schoolboys making *:::::
But sweeter far the contemplation
Of the approaching Long Vacation!
A Narrow Escape.
It is very lucky, that MESSRs. STRAHAN,
Paul, AND Co., at the time of their breaking,
did not hold “the Balance of Europe,” or else
Principalities by the dozen might have been
reduced to so many States of Insolvency, and
many a German, Kingdom, would have had to
part probably with its last Sovereign.
LE DIABLE A PARIS.
The Parisians have taken to a new amusement. We learn from our
contemporary, the 4tlas, that “the forgotten doctrines of the school of
Alexandria, especially the pursuit after forbidden knowledge and com-
munication with the Powers of Darkness, have, for the last two years,
been objects of study among the doctors and savans of Paris. Results
have been obtained, which have caused indescribable terror.” It seems
too, that the ARchbishop or PARIs, who, in order to frighten people
into religion, lent himself to these researches, has managed to, frighten
himself in the most remarkable manner, and cannot sleep without one
chaplain under, the bed, and another on, the mat outside_the door,
besides holy water in all the jugs, washhand basins, and caraffes. These
experiments go on, “not in the garret of the deluded alchemist, but in
the gorgeous saloons of the aristocracy.”
e séance diabolique must be a refreshing change from the humdrum
of an ordinary ball or party. , Fashionable invitation cards, we under:
stand, have in the corner, instead of “Quadrilles,” the word “Diables.”
The drawing-room tables are no longer covered with Books of Beauty
and Scenery ºf the Rhine, but with little square mediaeval works on
Magic, tastefully bound in flame-coloured silk, or in green scales. The
É. girl to whom }. have been introduced, asks you whether you
veſseen that lovely likeness of DEMogorgoN, and is enchanted with
the infernal verses you have written in MRs. SPIRITRAF's Album, and
a late arrival apologises, and hopes he has not kept the Incantation
waiting. . Elixirs and witch-potions are handed round by the servants,
instead of lemonade and negus, and your hostess, in lieu of asking you
to take a hand at whist, begs you to hold a Hand of Glory. . The music
of Der Freischütz has come up again, with that of Robert le Diable, to
the exclusion of Italian languishment and spasm, and you are desired
to prevail upon your wife to oblige the party with that delightful
“Screech du Demon,” or you are told that you really must take part
in “Blow, sulphur gales, and on your wing, our long expected Old’Un
bring.” The domestic servants, who are always nuisances, are the
fº. trouble to people who give this kind of thing, as they object to
the bore of fetching in bats' eyes and owls' ears, and babies' fingers and
tigers' chaudrons, and the other things wanted for the evening's amuse-
ments, besides getting so stupidly frightened as to be always knocking
down the skeletons and magic mirrors, and spilling the witch-broth up
the stairs. A ... buttons actually gave warning, lately, sooner than
allow himself to be punctured in the arm, though there was no more
“baboon's blood” in the house, all through his own carelessness. But
science has always had to contend with yulgar prejudice.
We hardly think, despite the story about “results,” “indescribable
terror,” and the scared Archbishop, that much has been done beyond
making some unpleasant smells, and spoiling some expensive carpets,
but we have instructed a correspondent to report, should any further
success be obtained. The aristocracy of the salons of Paris, contrived,
towards the end of last century, to raise a fiend they could never lay
again, but their posterity is luckily made of other stuff. Meantime
Iouis Napoleon seems a greater conjuror than all of them, for while
they only give run-away knocks at the door of the Prince. of the Air,
the EMPERon, by a slight tax on his ingenuity and his subjects, at once
raises the Wind.
DIRTY OLD FATHER THAMES.
We wonder that poor old Father Thames can remain quiet in his bed
which is literally, swarming with everything that is disagreeable, an
likely to disturb his repose. . Those who sleep in garrets have had a
taste of the inconvenience arising from cats in a lively condition, but
this is nothing when compared with the disgusting consequences of
having feline and canine carcases in every, stage of decomposition
itched into one's bed at all hours of the day, as well as the night;
ather Thames may be said to lead, literally, a cat and dog life, and
though it is an old saying that “as your bed is made so 3. must lie,”
there is no reason why the river should not have its bed made a little
more decently; or at least protected from being used as the receptacle
for all the filth of the metropolis. We should not be surprised to find
r old Father Thames some morning." dead in his bed,” for it is a
d in which anything like wholesome existence cannot much longer be
maintained.
A Good Price for Washing.
Wr, see that no less than £1800 a-year have been given to the
President and Secretary of the National Gallery. This is the largest
sum on record ever given, we should say, for washing. We would not
mind taking in a few of the Old Masters ourselves, and washing and
doing for them upon similar terms. In fact, we should not care making
a slight reduction, as the Old Masters would take less trouble washing
now, since so many of them have lost their coats.
RAILWAY NEWS.
THERE is an old lady who says, that she always likes to travel by a
trunk line, because then she feels confidence about the safety of #:
luggage.

12UNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TOBACCO IN THE CHURCH.
Y LORD NoFMANBY has prevailed
upon the magnanimous GRAND DUKE
ºn of Tuscany to take his royal canine
paw from the miserable , mouse,
CECCHETTI, the small animal having
aroused the ire of the regal brute by
daring to read the Bible to his own
family. The malignant Bible-reader
was sentenced to long imprisonment;
but LoRD NoHMANBY prevailed, and
CecchETTI was doomed to body's
banishment from sunny Tuscany; a
land of beauty with a government of
beast. The exile makes his way to
Turin; and there again he is suc-
coured by an Englishman, MR.
ERSKINE, our Chargé d'Affaires, who
prevails upon the Piedmontese govern-
ment—ever glad to please the English
—to give CECCHETTI employment in
one of the royal Tobacco manufactories. -
ddly enough, in the history of the weed, has Tobacco been associated
with the Bible. Smitten for reading the book, CEçCHETTI's hurts are
healed by the odorous leaf. In the early days of Virginia, Tobacco
was the wages of working Christianity; the parson was paid with
bird’s-eye and nigger-he The minister christened, married, and
buried for fees, duly regulated, of Tobacco. º les were, after
this fashion, tied together by pig-tail; and the torch of Hymen was all
smoke.”Tis observed,” says Bevealey, in his History of Virginia,
“that those counties where the Presbyterian meetings are, produce
very mean Tobacco; and, for that reason, can’t get an orthodox minister
to stay among them.” Thus, in Virginia, it might be said, show me
your 'bacco and I'll tell you your Bishop. -
good, serviceable parson received for annual maintenance 16,000lb.
of good Tobacco the difference of remuneration was, of course, in the
uality of the weed. For instance, a Virginian Bishop of Oxford—
#. may suppose such a costly exotic-would have the very finest and
most fragrant Tobacco; whereas a Virginian Exeter might take his
salary in good strong returns. -
For two hundred pounds of the weed, a man and woman might be
made matrimonially one; and man or woman buried at precisely double
the cost. That Tobacco should lay a man decently in the gravel Er
fumo dare lucenſ - - - - -
Thus, it will be seen, that Tobacco has in its time been a strange
working, agent in the Church, And now a poor, Tuscan, Christian,
unished for his devotion to the Bible, is rewarded in this life by
obacco. We hear that—at the suggestion of our waggish Churgé
d'Affaires at Turin—CEccHETTI has sent a screw of bird's-eye to the
DUKE OF Tuscany, with this *. May it please your Ducal
Highness, to condescend to put that in your pipe and smoke it!”
AN EPISTOLARY WEGETABLE,
SoMEBODY has written to the Times a letter, very much to the pur-
pose, quoting a correspondence from PLINy's letters, between PLINY
and TRAJAN, respecting, the .."; in of a nominal river, but real
sewer, which was promptly ordered by the Emperor at the suggestion
of the Philosopher: of whom both appear to have been “the right
men in the right places.” Who, however, could have been the author
of this communication?—for the signature thereto appended is “ONE
To whom THE THAMEs Is MEAT AND DRINK.” Now to what created
being can the Thames afford proper nourishment, liquid and solid, but
one belonging to the vegetable kingdom? The Thames may be meat
and drink to cabbage, but it would be poison to tailors, and is certainly
not less deleterious to the rest of the human race.
Sink-we Scento.
After five years the Thames is to receive no sewage."—Sir B. Hall.
IN shorter time, kind Sir, contrive
To purify our drink;
For while your figure is a Five,
Our river is a Cinq.
Neapolitan Frogs.
THE KING OF NAPLEs, a great stranger in his own capital—can
Naples haye a better recommendation?—went there on the occasion of
the late fée. Whereupon, certain animals exclaimed—“Long live our
absolute king!” When the king of the frogs took his #. by
mouthfulls, even the frogs (but then they were not Neapolitan) did not,
Accor to AEsop, -“Long live our absolute stork!”
UNPATRIOTIC CLUBS.
IT gº. that there are certain Benefit Clubs, particularly about
West Somersetshire, of which the members forfeit all the advantage;
§ enlistment into HER MAJESTY's service. What these Societies call
themselves we do not know, but can conceive various titles whereby
they might be designated. The United Cravens, the Incorporated
Sneaks, the Disloyal Lodge of Shabby Fellows, are a few of these. We
forbear to mention more, in the hope that a rule so disgraceful to any
association of Englishmen, will, in }. present hour of need, be expunged,
on the publication of this notice, before many minutes shall have been
added to that hour. Every Benefit Club should be a Society of Friends;
but the society might be friendly without being drab. A late Act, of
Parliament forbids the enforcement of this contemptible proviso in the
the case of Militiamen and the Naval Coast Guard Wolunteers. Could
not Parliament extend that enactment to the Line and the whose Navy,
by way of doing some little good before it separates?
POLES TO POKE THE RUSSIANS.
THE Eraminer advocates the formation of a Polish legion, especially
for the assault of Sebastopol; so do we. The garrison of that place is
composed in a large measure of Poles, who can have no great affection
for the service they are engaged in, and may be called negative Poles.
Our Polish legion, burning with hatred against the enslavers of their
race, furious in the recollection of Russian cruelty, outrage, and wrong
would come under the denomination of positive Poles. Negative and
positive, positive and negative Poles, would mutually attract one
another, as the case is in ordinary magnetism: and if we stirred up the
Russians with these Poles, no doubt we should meet with foes who
would strike beside us.
Meat, Drink, and Manure.
WE send missionaries to reclaim the cannibals from eating human
flesh: to which end the best means would be to endow the savages, if
possible, with the understanding and the affections necessary to enable
them to comprehend and practise what they are taught: the next best,
if also possible, to work a few physical miracles, which would convert
these anthropophagous natives by astonishing them. Practically, per-
Thaps, the best method of bringing them over to beef and mutton would
be to give a mission for that purpose to M. SoYER. But why do we
talk of converting cannibals? There is something even worse that man
may swallow than other men's mere flesh—There is the Thames!
A Chance for Knightsbridge.
THE subjoined appears in the papers:–
“The Monitore Toscano states that the Pope has resolved to appoint an Italian
Bishop to ‘the now vacant see of Constantinople.”
Unless, an Italian be indispensable for the post-may Mr. Punch
suggest that His Holiness should promote and appoint the Rev. MR.
LIDDELL, of St. Paul's, Knightsbridge?
A BUILT-UP JOKE.
... Our own Correspondent informs us, that the firing before Sebastopol
if not always most effective, is at all events bold and vigorous; for every
man stands up to his mortar like a brick.
A. WHIS PER TO BORES.
B9REs should be lenient enough to bear in mind this truth:-that it
is with the Fire of Conversation as with any other fire—little Sticks
kindle it, great Sticks put it out.
Go To BATH.-We recommend Old Father Thames to try the Cold
Water Cure, as there is but little doubt that a good washing would do
him all the good in the world.
MR. PºſNCH is glad that the people who had their windows broken, a
few Sundays ago, are proceeding to sue, the Hundred, as this shows
º: conviction that the Million had nothing to do with the disgraceful
uSlneSS.
It is to be hoped.that LoRD JoHN Russell, obtained no refreshmen

A DEJEUNER A L’EAU.
WE have heard of º teas, and other absurdities, but the inost
eccentric meal that has yet fallen under our notice, is a breakfast in the
water, which has been advertised by the Maidstone Swimming Club.
The announcement of this wishy-washy entertainment concludes by the
intimation, that “every member will be required to partake of the
repast in the river.” We presume that several pounds of tea will be
thrown into the water, with a sufficient quantity of sugar, while a
supply of cream will be allowed to run over the surface, and the process
of “stirring” will of course be effected by the members themselves,
who will act as their own spoons. The ham will have to be gut in
Vauxhall slices, so that, in the act of º a morsel may be adroitly
sºapped at, and a few hard-boiled eggs will be thrown in for the satis-
faction of those whose appetites take an oval turn... We fear that the
dry toast will be none the better for being soaked in the river, and as
to the bread and butter, it will be necessary to give particular directions
that the butter side shall be kept upwards, in order to prevent the whole
from being converted into a *PW sloppy mess, which no amount of
hunger would be able to relish. e cannot help feeling that a break-
fast in the water, will be very much like a dinner in nubibus, or a
supper taken at a castle in the air. For ourselves we can only say
that we would rather starve for twenty-four hours than adopt such an
uncomfortable method of fishing for a meal.
Co-loanial Devices
A FINANCIAL writer, who appears to have only ºil, considered his
subject with reference to the law of neum and tuum, suggests that
“the gold of Australia ought to be used in reduction of our national
debt.” This ingeniouſ plan for obtaining an advance is certainly the
newest reading of the colonial motto, “Advance, Australia.”
FLATTERY.-The Pope assures BoMBA, that he is “the best of tyrants.”
THE LORD MAYOR IN DANGER.
A PROPOSITION was made the other day at a Court of Aldermen
“that the LoRD MAYOR, should take the usual view of the River
Thames.”. Considering that the river savours of everything that is
disagreeable, we must say, that the }. osal savours of cruelty. Besides
it is quite superfluous to take any fresh view of the Thames, for the
“usual view”, now taken of it is that it is a filthy and disgusting
nuisance, which can't be got rid of too speedily. W. are happy to
find that the suggestion, which really looks like a piece of spite against
the poor LORD MAYOR, was at once negatived. Had the “view” been
resolved upon, a sum of £700 was to have been allowed for expenses,
though we confess we do not see what expense could legitimately arise
unless it had been for Eau de Cologne, Sal Volatile, and other restora-
tives that might have been necessary to “correct” the obnoxious
odours arising from the river. Perhaps a portion of the £700 might
have been put aside for additional insurances on the LoRD MAYoº's
life, which would have been jeopardised had he been compelled to take
his own private view of the river. -
Up with your Copper.
In their admirable petition to HER MAJESTY, the English Engravers
complaining of the systematic insults of the Royal Academy) say, that
they “look upon the art of engraving as akin to the art of translation.”
This is a delicate compliment to the English dramatists, especially from
the steel engravers, who gracefully refuse to make a difference between
what is steel and what is stolen.
A NATURAL REQUEST.
THE "Fibre Company” has, it seems, been canvassing certain
parties of the House of Lords for support. ft is only natural that those
who would make paper should apply to reputations that have gone to
rags.

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
July 30. Monday. LoRD BRough AM expressed his opinion that, after
all, some }. had been made in Law Reform this Session. As
Mr. Punch intends to “take stock” as soon as the Session is over, he
will probably have something to say upon this head.
In the Commons the Limited Liabilities Bill proceeded, and, later in
the week, and after some more hindrances from the monied men, who
are horribly disgusted that a poor man should presume to lend, instead
of confining himself to his own sphere, and, with due humility, borrow-
ing of themselves, was passed.
It was stated by Government that we are to have an Italian Legion,
and Mr. Punch trusts that fº street organist in London will be in-
stantly pressed into it—and, if he might add a suggestion to the Com-
mander of the Forces, he would recommend that such part of the
Legion be allowed the utmost opportunity of distinguishing itself under
the very hottest fire.
LoRD PALMERSTON announced that the Session must terminate about
the 14th or 15th. It is stated that HER MAJESTY will not prorogue in
}. being, it is believed, too much ashamed of the conduct of her
arliament to meet, it without a rebuke, which her kindliness of nature
disposes her to withhold. The Foreign Secretary, by reason of his
superior acquaintance with the French tongue, is to accompany his
Sovereign to Paris; and it is to be hoped that before his }.
returns, he will endeavour, to procure a translation of the word
“solidairement,” which, in the Turkish Loan debate, baffled the united
lingual skill of the British House of Commons, and which in Nugent's
†each Dictionary, for the Use of Schools and Young Persons, Edit, xvi.
1830, p. 303, is explained to mean “wholly.”
A great deal of money was voted in Committee of Supply. In the
course of the debates on these grants, that ridiculous person, MR.
Arsley PELLATT, the China-shop.man, offered three pieces of oppo.
sition, which may as well be mentioned, because they show what kind
of an article PELLATT is. He wished to disallow the item of £10,000
for pictures for the National Gallery, the item of £12,000 for the accom-
modation of 200,000 additional boºks for the British Museum, and the
miserable item of £250 for incidental expenses of the Belfast College.

By the margin of Thames' dirty waters,

At the close of a hot summer's day:
As he lay in his pestilent quarters,

This youth was heard faintly to say:-

This river is poison to me.
Oh! I’d rather be drown'd in its tide,
Ur—ah—oh—ugh
Than of typhus die off at its side. -

Ugh! Ügh!—No. I'll move from my lodgings instead.
Ur—ah—oh—ugh No. I don't fancy its bed.

Sea-Side Fashions.
THE “Uglies” worn by the young ladies at Ramsgate,
are of a larger size than ever this year. They are so large
that it is almost impossible for the young beauty that is shut
up inside to see anything without taking her bonnet off. ..It
is said that certain modest, mammas, have organised this
monstrous fashion purposely, in order to prevent their
daughters seeing the strange sights that not unfrequently
take place on the beach of a morning whilst the bathing-
machines are out.
Mr. Punch requests that due attention may be paid to MR. PELLATT's
regard for the arts, for literature, and for education.
The Partnership Amendment Bill is another victim to Parliamenta
neglect. It was spared from the Massacre of the Innocents, to f
more ignominiously to-day by the hand of Bouverie.
Tuesday. The Lords sent the Metropolis Management Bill through
Committee with laudable speed. - -
In the Commons, the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExCHEQUER said, that in
his budget he had taken a trifling “margin” of Three and a half Miſſions
beyond the then estimated expenditure of the year, but he should want
a great deal more. He could not, however, tell them how much until
they had granted the supplementary sums for which he had already asked.
Let them mind one thing at a time. The intimation quieted the
House, and they went on ăuţi, voting money till midnight. -
The new Sale of Beer Act went through Committee. The pious
MARQUIs, or BLANDFoRD, and the sapient MR.FREWEN opposed it,
but were beaten by 62 to 10. The bill was passed on Thursday.
Wednesday. Nothing particular, MR. Otway tried to cut. off the
salary of the gentleman who travels to buy pictures for the nation, but
this ſittle bit of cheese-paring injustice was scouted by the House.
Thursday. LoRD REDEspale advised the Government to buy up the
ground between Downing Street and George Street. . It was naturally
supposed that his Lordship was about to recommend the erection of a
ºt 8. ” thereon, for Peeresses and their friends, in order to relieve
the Chamber of Peers from the name which he was good enough to
affix to it, when some of the wives and daughters of the noblemen of
England found an interesting debate more attractive than an opera.
But the courteous Lord only wanted to build public offices on the
ground in question. - -
In the Commons, the very improper pension to LORD GEORGE PAGET
was defended on the weakest and most contradictory grounds. To do
LoRD GEORGE justice, he seems to have done his best to deprive his
friends of an excuse for giving him the money, but they almost forced
it upon him. -
Great sums of money were voted for Commissariat and Ordnance
º, and £15,000 for the erection of a Museum at Kensington
ore.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MAJOR REED made another attempt to get LoRD PALMERSTON to
romise that Parliament should be consulted before any peace is made
ut he could only obtain from the PREMIER the highly satisfactory an
comprehensive pledge, that he would do everything that was proper.
#. ChancELLor, or THE ExchEQUER, having obtained his sup-
plementary votes, was so obliging as to say how much. Imore money he
wanted. He merely asked leave to raise Seven Millions, by loan.
GLADstone thought that more taxes ought to be laid on, instead; but
the House thought not, and granted the required permission.
Friday. A good deal of talk in both houses, on the one subject of the
day. The Lords left off like gentlemen, but in the Commons the
uestion of the Vienna conferences was lost sight of in a personal row.
The opponents of the Turkish Loan were very savage with SIR WILLIAM
Molesworth for charging them with “combination,” and they abused
him a good deal, GLADSTONE º likening him to “an old woman
who fancied she had seen a ghost,” and PHILLIMORE using, downright
IBillingsgate. The House . up abruptly in the middle of the
disturbance. On inquiring at the Colonial Office next day, Mr. Punch

THE REPORT OF THE POLICE COMMITTEE.
... WE fancy we know the º: of the Committee instituted to inquire
into the brutal conduct of the Police in Hyde Park, even before it is
É. If we are not much mistaken, it will run something in the
ollowing strain:-
“We have made the most searching inquiries into the conduct of the Police on
Sunday, July the First, in Hyde Park, and this is the result of our inquiries:—
“The Police, far from behaving with the brutality so erroneously attributed to them
conducted themselves with the greatest gentleness and forbearance. Nothing could
exceed the good temper they displayed. No praises can be too great for the lamb-like
endurance they exhibited in return for the words and blows of the very hardest nature
that they received for many consecutive hours from the infuriated populace.
“Numerous instances of this have come to our knowledge. The following, perhaps,
may suffice:
“A policeman (W 104) disarmed a mob of boys, who had been pelting him for
the last quarter of an hour, by going up mildly to them, and offering them (with a
smile) some nuts.
“Constable SAMPson was struck by a ruffian at least three times his own size.
He unaffectedly repeated the words of the ancient philosopher, and said “Strike, but
Hear.’ The ruffian's arm instantly fell, and grasping the Constable's hand, he listened,
not unmoved, whilst the latter recited to him the whole of Da. WATTs's beautiful poem i
“Let dogs delight to bark and bite."
“The X Division, though told three times to disperse a mob of not less than a
thousand boys, who had been flinging oyster-shells and all sorts of missiles at their
heads for the space of twenty minutes, refused peremptorily to do so, because a little
child with a hoop happened to be in the way.
“All those who surrendered themselves prisoners to the Police, were conducted with
the greatest consideration to the Royal Humane Society, where they were offered
refreshments at the Policeman's own expense, several of them having contributed a
day's pay for that purpose. After the prisoners had refreshed themselves, the Police-
men were kind enough to accompany them as far as the Station House in Wine Street,
but not liking the poor fellows to go upon foot, they sent for cabs, which they insisted
upon paying for themselves.
“The Police on this occasion have had no less than 158 eyes completely blackened.
The Surgeon of the Force reports having had as many as 556 noses under his care,
the haemorrhage from which, he says, was absolutely frightful. This proves stronger
than any argument which side the blows came from.
sº conduct of the Police on the above trying occasion is entitled to the highest
praise,
A Prophecy Unavoidably Delayed.
MR. CoppeN's familiar swagger about “crumpling up Russia as
easily as a sheet of paper,” has only been delayed in consequence of
the extreme scarcity of the material. . But when, the Muscovite
Empire is reduced to rags, there will doubtlessly be a better supply in
the market, and consequently less difficulty in procuring a sheet of
paper to carry out the illustration. . Further than this, only let the
sheet in question contain a report of one of MR. CoRDEN's, Russian
speeches, and we will warrant that every Englishman's hand will be
instantly raised against it, only too anxious to crumple it up.
AN EVERY-DAY MORAL,
THE Law may be compared to a street-fight, at the end of which it is
discovered that the coats of the combatants are missing. The fact is,
the Lawyers, whilst their clients were pommeling one another, have
quietly walked off with them 1
LADIEs yoR Legislators.--There is one very good reason why
ladies should be eligible for Members of Parliament. They would
afford such abundant facilities for pairing off.

OUR OWN COMMITTEE ON THE BEER BILL.
HE Committee ap-
pointed by Mr. Punch
to inquire. into the
operation of the Sun-
day Beer Act reports
that Sabbatarian legis-
lation for the purpose
of getting sots to go
to church is a day too
late. It is remarked
by the Committee that
almost everybody who
is addicted to inebri-
ety, especially if a
member of the cellar-
less and clubless
classes, is nearly sure
to get drunk, on a
Saturday night, and
to lie a-bed the next
day. To have such
a person, then, in
church-going condi-
tion on Sunday morn-
ing it would be neces-
i. to close the pub-
lic-houses, early, on
the evening before,
The Committee point
out that the hour at
- which it would be
necessary, to shut up
the liquor-shops on Saturday evening would be a very º: indeed, in order that the
votaries of Bacchus might have time to get sufficiently sober to attend. to their religious
duties. This arrangement would, in London at least, be attended with a serious inconvenience.
º: fainting with thirst from the heat of theatres, or from their ºwn exertions, in
laughing at farces and comedies, and crying at tragedies (or the reverse), and from perspiring
at both, would be unable to step out between the acts to get a draught of stout; still less
to procure a º of that beverage after the performances. -
o meet this difficulty two several courses are suggested by Mr. Punch's Committee.
One is, to enact that the public-houses shall be permitted to supply refreshment, to bond
ſide playgoers, inclusive of persons attending meetings and oratorios, if any, at Exeter Hall,
in case of their choosing to demand a “drain” under that denomination. Audiences and
attendants of all other concerts and meetings, not being “free and easy."...and of lectures,
provided the lecture be dry, that is, unaccompanied by grog or malt, liquor, would be
entitled to the same privilege. The claimants would be required to produce a refreshment;
ticket, which would be supplied at the theatre, concert, or lecture-room., The ticket would
be stamped by Government, to prevent imposition; the machinery for this purpose might
involve some expense, but what would that be to the people compared with the advantage
they would derive from having the kind and gracious designs of a pious Aristocracy for their
moral and spiritual improvement carried out? Thus, the objection to the word bond ſide
would be obviated; and the Committee adds, that in order to secure the genuineness of
the tickets, it might be advisable to make the counterfeiting of them felony, thereby the
more certainly to render the sumptuary project of the sumptuous orders feasible. The other
course recommended by Mr. Punch's Committee, is to let all sumptuary and Sabbatarian
legislation whatever alone.
EDUCATION AT THE ANTIPODES.
-
MELBourne had, according to the last advices from Australia, i. opened its University,
after a magnificent speech from the Chancellor, whose style of eloquence combines all the
rotundity of the cannon-ball with all the hollowness of the cannon. We are of course great
advocates for the spread of education all over the world; but we are afraid there is not much
#. t for the cause, from the state of things at Melbourne; where, after, an estimate of
,000 for the building, £20,000 for the land, and £9000 a-year for the endowment of the
new University, there are only sixteen, students to profit by the tremendous outlay, The
institution is to stand on forty acres of land, which will give precisely two agres and a half
to each pupil. Perhaps the better mode of turning the concern to account will be to convert
it into a vast gymnasium, with a Professorship of Cricket, who should give lectures on long:
stop, and other physical accomplishments, which seem to be congenial to the youth, ºf
Victoria. It is really a reflection on the colony, that its inhabitants are so immersed in
money-grubbing that they cannot even spare their sons from the degrading pursuit, and, only
sixteen youths can be mustered throughout the whole of the vast locality to accept, the
offer of a liberal education. The fact is, that nearly everybody in the colony is making
haste to get rich, in the hope of returning to England, where after all they are only doomed
to disappointment; for the vulgar rich—who have nothing but their dross to recommend
them—are happily at a discount on this side of the world, as from their numbers they
necessarily are on the other.

Bus Driver. “Now THEN, out of THE way, YOU TWO !”
=
THE WALUE OF A NAME.
WE have often been struck by the sentimental earnestness of some
respectable old ...; on the stage, who honestly announcing the
emptiness of his pockets, begins to puff away at his own integrity with
a force which might make a blacksmith blush for the feebleness of his
bellows. “Ah, my children | "roars out occasionally some seedy stage
veteran, “Ah, my children! though I cannot leave, ye land, or gold,
I can bequeath to ye a still nobler inheritance, an untarnished name”;
which, by the way, might be the boast of anybody who could leave to
his heirs, executors, and assigns a well-polished brass door-plate.
We are not often in the habit of attaching much value to this very
nominal sort of estate, for an unsullied paternal name can be of little
consequence, as far as the business of life is concerned, unless the heir
wishes to make use of the name for fraudulent purposes. It does not
follow that Jones junior cannot be a scamp because Jones senior was
a respectable man, and we have therefore come to the conclusion, that
in a commercial sense, a "good name” is no very great catch by way
of inheritance. We admit the moral value of the bequest; but it is
only against the alleged pecuniary benefit to be derived from what is
commonly called a “good name” that we enter our protest.
We have, however, recently met with an instance in which a name
has brought with it such an accession of fortune as almost to justify the
clap-traps with which a stage father usually announces his intention to
leave nothing in the world but the monosyllable Jones (without a
blot on any part of it) to a numerous family. The instance to which
we, allude is that of MR. CHRISTOPHER, originally. DUNDAs, who
called himself CHRISTOPHER, for £14,000 a-year, and is now, for the
rºle consideration of £38,000 a-year about to cali' himself
ISBET.
We can only say, that we would call ourselves BUGGINs or MUGGINs
Hopkins or PoPKINs, or anything that anybody might think fit to call
us, for one quarter of the money. We {. that ladies have some-
times very large sums settled on them before they can be induced to
change their names; but it is difficult to conceive the motive for offering
a gentleman several thousands a-year to alter his appellation.
IMPORTANT FROM THE EAST.
AMID the latest intelligence, or anticipations of the Overland Mail in
one of the morning papers, our eye fell upon the following rather
startling announcement:-
“HAssan BEY has received a present of a copper watch.”
We do not yet see the effect this circumstance is likely to produce on
European, Asiatic, African, or American politics. The Foreign Cor-
respondent who communicates this piece of news had probably no time
for details, but in a future letter he will perhaps enlighten the world
with further particulars. Who gave HAssan Bey the copper watch?
What did HAssan say when he #. it? Did the watch go? and a
hundred other kindred questions will occur to the mind in reference to
this somewhat remarkable topic. ... We wonder if the papers published
in the East are filled with such foreign intelligence as that which we
have quoted above, and whether such, facts as “MR. Jones has re-
ceived a present of a silver pencil-case,” finds its way into the columns
of our Asiatic contemporaries under the head of “Latest from London.”
We have no personal knowledge of the recipient of the copper-watch,
but any one to whom a present is given is, pro tanto, a “gifted indi-
vidual.” Nevertheless we should be disposed to look upon HAssan
BEY as HASSAN rather green.
Parliamentary Obsequies.
A BILL has been brought into Parliament under the title of the
Burial of the Dead Bill. As this is about the regular time, for the
Massacre of the Parliamentary Innocents, a Burial of the Dead Bill is
less than was to be expected one would naturally look out for the
burial of numerous dead bills.
THE STATE OF AFFAIRs.—A Member of the Opposition wrote lately
to one of his constituents:—“Things, are in such a miserable state
that, without PALMERSTON, it would be absolutely impossible to
laugh at all.”

OUR PHILO-RUSSIAN COUSINS,
To the Editor of Punch.
gº SIR,
“Your countrymen appear to be astonished at the circum:
stance that few of mine sympathise with them in their present contest
with Russia, and that not a few Americans are rather disposed to
wish, that 3: enemies may whip you. use we are a free and
enlightened nation, Britishers think that we have got to range ourselves
alongside of civilisation and liberty against despotic government and
barbarism. But this is a no-ways logical expectation, and #. let me
indicate to you in a few words the reasons why it §on't foiler. The
CZAR OF Russia is no slave, he isn’t. He may be the only freeman in
his own dominions, but a freeman he is. He does whatever he pleases;
that is genuine freedom. The CzAR is monarch of all he surveys, an
considerable more. Now in all these here particulars each individual
American citizen stands on the same platform with the CzAR; ALEx-
ANDER is the center, of a more extensive circle than the American
citizen; but that is all. He rules over serfs; we govern niggers. The
knout is a'most identical with the cowhide; so there ain’t much to
choose between our scepters. And I tell you that, we don't nohow
like to hear serfs and knouts and irresponsible volitiºn, cried down.
It is indirectly abusing our own glorious institutions. It is flogging us
Americans over the EMPEROR of Russia's shoulders. Qpposition to
the CzAR's attempt on Turkey would, with a change of circumstances,
be resistance to our annexation of Cuba. It is no more nor less than
a special assertion of the immoral principle of trying to, prevent a
powerful nation from carrying out its destiny. It is a line which we no
way: approbate. -
‘We ain't afeard that Russia will subjugate the whole world. We do
not opinionate that she will enslave any more than the Eastern hemis-
phere. We have got to possess ourselves of the Western. This planet
will then be divided between ourselves and Russia. In the meantime
we have no vocation to interfere with each other. Russia will pursue
her independent course, and we ourn. By that means we shall partition
the globe in a friendly lº, -
“We cannot forget that we are the descendants of Englishmen,
ſº there exists a good many reasons why there should be no love
ost between us and England. Qur pilgrim forefathers left the old
country because they couldn’t conform to its institutions; and many of
them were sent here on the same account. Not only that, but some of
your authors have ridiculed our manners and customs. We are a
serious people. It riles us to make fun of us, .We can't tolerate it.
But what is wust of all is the language and sentiments of all English
writers respecting our institution of slavery. Their impious abolitionist
doctrines and disgusting negroisms, have given mortal offence to a con-
siderable some of our population. - -
It is not a fact that we are indifferent to thedº. and the
danger of European Arts, º and Learning. Our innards yearn
towards our Anglo-Saxon kindred. But suppose our affection for you
was ever so ardent. Suppose the Cossacks were ten thousand times
more barbarous than they are, and were a-desolating of your hearths and
homes with rapine, fire, and sword. Still we should be unable to
break with Russia. She is very valuable. We are tied up to her by
an everlasting strong knot. I mean our trade. That is our business.
Your miseries would be no business of ourn. You are firing five-
pounders sterling shells against Sebastopol. How could we be such
goneys as to pitch dollars at Russia instead of continuing to subduc-
tionate them out of her? We couldn’t afford to give her offense if we
wished. . So just abandon all hopes of our allowing our loafers and
rowdies to list in VICTORIA's service, or loaning you a helping hand in
any way against, our Russian customers.... We, can't fix it nohow :
that's a fact I tell you, which you may credit, although I am a
“JElackburn, Va., August, 1855. “KNOW NoTHING.”
MARRIAGE IN CONTINENTAL HIGH LIFE,
By the Morning Post's account—
“A letter from Warsaw states that the marriage of the GRAND DUKE Nicholas
brother of the EMPERoa or Russia, to the Paixcess or OLDENBURG, daughter of
PRINCE PETER or OLDENBURG, has been positively determined on, and will take place
very shortly.”
Another apron-tie between Russia, and “Fatherland.” The Czar
has contracted one more matrimonial alliance with, Germany. How
long will Germans wait for the announcement of a political one?
A Lathering Flung Away.
JERöME CARDAN, as recorded by MR. MoRLEy, was in the habit of
saying, “When you mean to wash, first see that you have a towel
handy.”, England is to blame for not having better, attended to the
above advice. Before attempting to give Russia a goodwipe in the face,
we ought to have seen that we had our Russian towelling all ready.

PUNCH'S ILLUSTRATIONS TO SHAKSPEARE,
* Richmond is on the seas.”
Richard III., Act iv., Scene 4.
LoRD EBRINGTON prided himself at having
told LoRD PANMURE, that “it would be very
hot in the Crimea during the summer.” But
the Marylebone Prophet surely did not stop
there? He also informed Lord *::::::: that
when the winter came, it would doubtlessly be
extremely cold in the Crimea. . He likewise ven-
tured to say, that supposing it rained much, it
would probably be wet under foot, and that, when
there were four or five feet of snow upon the
ground, there would be without doubt an end to
all cricketing. It was in consequence of these
statements, the force of which LoRD PANMURE
admitted at once, that boots, tents, stoves, and
all kinds of provisions and clothing, were sent out
to the Crimea. Our brave Army in the East,
little knows what it owes to LoRD EBRINGTON,
and we did not know ourselves until his Lord-
ship kindly told us.
TWO STUMBLING BLOCKS.
ON the same day the Marlborough and the
MARQUIs of BLANDFORD found themselves in an
awkward “fix”—the one at Portsmouth, and the
other in the House of Commons. The Marlborough
would not take the water, and the BLANDFord
ºs, would not take any beer—at least stood in the way
j . of the public taking any beer on the Sunday.
Both crafts were guilty of obstructing the public
“ways.” However, the Marlborough has since
been removed, but the other stumbling-block still
remains, and is as likely as ever to impede any
useful measure from being launched by thrusting
before it some wooden “slip” or other, that is sure
to be out of order. The sooner this crazy old BLAND-
FORD and his numerous slips are knocked away,
the better it will be for the progress of business
and the smoothness of all parliamentary “ways.”
THE CHEMISTRY OF THE CANNON.
MR. Punch begs to give HER MAJESTY's Government the following
Notice of Motion:—Somebody to move for returns of the expenses incur-
red since the commencement of the War, in trying experiments for the
purpose of applying the resources of chemical and mechanical science
to the destruction of HER JESTY's enemies, their fortifications and
shipping. It is in no spirit of petty economy that Mr. Punch instigates
somebody to move for this return. Quite on the contrary, Mr. Punch
is afraid that the expenditure devoted to this most important purpose
has been ridiculously small. Hardly a day passes without the Times
containing a complaint of neglect at the hands of the Ordnance Board
from some inventor of a projectile or a º apparently calculated
to kill swarms of Russians, and blow up their nests. In particular a
very awakening_letter—though of course it will not rouse official
sleepers-from DR, BENAMIN.W. Richardson appeared in that
journal the other day. From that communication, it appears that a
ntleman named Scott has, like CAPTAIN DISNEY, invented an in-
ammable liquid and a shell, the latter of which, charged with the
former, promises, at least, to afford the most valuable assistance to our
brave defenders in executing their high and humane commission to sink,
burn, kill, and destroy the miscreants who have broken the sweet peace
of the world, and have forced us into this horrible War. Well and
truly does the Doctor say:-
“I think I have shown that the Board of Ordnance might at least have instituted
one or two experiments bearing on an inquiry so scientific, simple, and innportant.”
In the same day's Times another letter appears, with the signature of
BAshLEY BRITTEN; the writer whereof has devised an improved sort
of artillery, of which the Government has made incomplete trial with
results that want nothing but confirmation to be conclusive. MR.
BRITTEN says:-
* The only thing I require is the authority to make a few more experiments, but, in
order to be useful, they must be on a very much larger scale than hitherto, and entered
into in a more free and liberal spirit, with perhaps a little more assistance from military
experience, savouring less of criticism on my efforts as a civilian.”
Government does not hesitate, to expend immense treasures, in
#. the experiment of building enormous ships, which has
thoroughly failed, but it grudges, the outlay of a little money on the
repetition of an experiment in artillery practice, which appears to have
ſºul
Still in the same Times, MR. ALEXANDER PARKEs complains that he
cannot induce the Government to grant him a trial of “a new shell, and
a powder which is considerablymore powerful than ordinary gunpowder.”
And then there is LoRD INUNDoNALD's plan, which there is very strong
reason indeed to suppose to be what he asserts it. What if the
noble Lord really can, for the comparatively small charge of £240,000
annihilate the Russians like so many of those insects that infest beds
Would ministers rather crack or crush each individual of these swarm-
ing myriads at several hundred pounds a head?, Do they kill their own
thus?...If there is nothing in his Lordship's plan, why don't they say
so? If there is anything, why not try it? If they fail—they fail, and
there is a little more money lost. If they succeed there is an end of the
War, and (perhaps) the Income Tax. It remains untried, and the people
don't know the reason why. But Mr. Punch does. Dr. RICHARDson
points out that the mere publication of the note of CAPTAIN DISNEY’s
experiments, is sufficient to put every chemist in Europe, up to the
composition of the substance with which his projectile is charged, and
to enable such a fellow as JAcoBI to employ it against us... This will
by-and-by be done. The reason why the Government, and especially
the Board of Ordnance, is so apathetic in reference to this kind of in-
ventions, is, that it has not yet been done—that the Russians have
not hitherto succeeded in applying them to the destruction of, the
British fleet. Should they persevere and succeed in doing so, then
perhaps, the Committee of the Board of Ordnance will be reconstituted
on the model of the Commission for exploring chemistry and mechanics
in order to exterminate us, which has been established by our savage
but sharp foes at St. Petersburgh: unless, indeed, ministers shall have
had Red Tape Street blown about their ears, the Russians having
bombarded the Treasury from London Bridge.
“Descend, Ye Nine!”
FROM the opera of the Etoile du Nord we learn the important his-
toric fact, that PETER THE GREAT suppressed nine letters of the
Russian Alphabet. However, we are secretly informed, that these nine
letters will shortly be restored, out of compliment to Mr. Gºostone
having given his name, which also consists of nine letters, to the
extension of Cossack barbarism.

The penny was instantly given.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NINETEEN FORTUNES FOR THREEPENCE.
UNCH sees that a fellow advertises,
that for twelve stamps he will send ºt
a circular enabling a person to earn
an income in “nineteen, respect-
able ways;” one of which is, pro-
bably, the obtaining stamps by
means of such promises as the
advertiser's. One of these hum-
bugs, having secured the stamps
he demands, writes to his .
that they may earn a respectable
living by buying potatoes whole-
sale, roasting them, and sellin
them about the streets by retail,
and this too may be another of the
nineteen ways in question. Mr.
Punch, desirous to undersell the
party, hereby offers to apprise the
public of nineteen ways of earning
an income, all for the price of three-
pence; and, in addition, presents

through the Insolvent Court.
5. Go into the House of Commons as an “independent” member,
and transfer your allegiance in return for a good place.
6. Open a private bank, and convert your customers' money and
securities to your own use-only get your passport before you suspend
payment.
7. Set up a *|†: shop, and “warrant” º: articles to

cription “not being held to exceed the ordinary licence of commerce.”
8. Enter into business as a baker, and take care that your loaves
contain the due commercial proportion of ground bones, mashed
potatoes, and alum.

money at a hundred per cent. to pay you not to expose them to their

Now in this moral, civilised, and Christian country, none of these
nineteen means of earning an income” are unlawful, and most of
them are in the highest degree “respectable,” and lead their followers
to honour and emolument. Mr. Punch submits that in suggesting them,
he has honourably earned his threepence.
GERMAN ARMOUR; OR, MAIL AND FEMALE.
The German warrior was, of yore, array'd in fashion grim,
A dragon on his helm he wore, an iron suit clad him;
His bonnet now of straw should be, with ribbons for a crest;
In silk or muslin, cap-à-pie, our Teuton should be drest.
For corslet in a corset should his bosom now be cased,
Thereto a satin sash were good for girdle to his waist;
He, also, for a stout mail shirt should wear a slight chemise,
And flowing robe with flounce and skirt much lower than the knees.
Gauntlets of iron let him leave for kid gloves, and prefer
The silken stocking to the greave, the sandals to the spur:
The arbalest §: ages saw the stalwart German pull;
The modern Berliner should draw the thread of Berlin wool.
For now the German's is the case of maiden or of wife,
His post is not in honour's place, he holds aloof from strife.
He owes protection, like a wench, unto the stronger hand
And leaves the Ínglish and the French to fight for Fatherland.
Break, enervated Prussian, break the needle from thy gun;
To needlework that needle take, and let thy work be done;
Whilst to defend thee from Cossacks the brave Allies advance,
Hem Tricolours and Union-Jacks for England and for France.
PLUSH UNDER SCHEDULE D.
A GENERAL meeting of the Livery of the West-end as well as the
City, that is, of the metropolitan domestics in the service of the fashion:
able and 1. classes, was held yesterday evening at JENKINs'
Hotel. The meeting was convened in consequence of a letter signed
“Omega,” which appeared lately in the Times, proposing to extend the
Income Tax to stewards, butlers, grooms of the chamber, cooks, upper
coachmen, stud-grooms, housekeepers, and culinary persons of the female
sex, receiving from £50 to £100 a-year wages, besides lodging, light,
fire, and food, and to assess those gentlemen andladies underschedulei).
THE DUKE of PIMLlco filled the chair very completely in the
person of that nobleman's butler, and in spite of some difficulty of
...; attendant on a plethoric state of system, succeeded in ex:
plaining the object of the meeting, amid murmurs and cries of “shame!”
The MARQUIs of BAYswATER, represented by one of his Lordship's
ootmen, rose to move a resolution that the proposed, extension of the
Hincome. Tax. to gentlemen and ladies in domestic, service was, a
unjust, himpolitic, and ridiclous suggestion. The Noble Lord said he
would stand by his horder. Hignorance of taxation had been their
F. time out of mind. It was always inseparable from plush, and
e oped it would hever remain so. “What is taxes?” should ever be
the proud question of a gentleman olding the hoffice which he had the
honour to fill. He didn't know, and he didn’t want to know, what
they was, and should resist every attempt to give him any information
on that unpleasant subject.
The resolution was seconded by SIR GEORGE TYBURN, BARONET,
who derives his family name from the head of the family in which he is
situated. SIR GEORGE dwelt upon the injustice of taxing a part only
of the master's wealth and taxing the servants' hall.
A gentleman wearing the denomination, as well as the boots, of
Montague BRUTON, Esq., moved a resolution pledging the assembly
to use its utmost endeavours to frustrate any attempt on the part of
Government to render the gentlemen and ladies of ladies and gentlemen
subject to Income Tax. It would be no ard matter to put a stop
to any sitch scheme in case it was started. The legislature was in the
ands of valley-de-shams, and if they found any, such projick was
lºwed they would only ave to give warnin’ and stand by one
another.
LoRD, MARYLEBONE, a nobleman by, the courtesy of the cloth,
seconded the resolution. His lordship observed that service was no
ineritance, and the wages that ought to go into the savings' bank
didn't qught to be grabbed by the Exchequer. They were found in
food, lodging, &c., but what then? What became of all that, if they

A SCRAP OF COLLECTIVE WISDOM,
MR. NAPIER is reported to have made a rather wise speech on the
motion for going into Committee on the Sale of Beer Bill. According
to the Times—
“MR. NAPIER was of opinion that the subject of the bill was not one in which the
House should lightly interfere; but at the same time he thought it would not be
worthy of the House to repeal in one session an act passed in the preceding session.”
By parity of reasoning, if MR. NAPIER, were such a thing possible,
made a foolish speech at one moment, it would be unworthy of him to
retract it the next moment., Perhaps the reporter, by mistake, has sub-
stituted “worthy” for “characteristic.” As MR. NAPIER's remark
stands § may be F. to be its sole advantage, and it lacks
that additions merit of sweetness which is necessary to render it, by
the popular similitude, equivalent in quality to a donkey's gallop.
The Banker's Chapel,
SIR John DEAN PAUI's Chapel, Chelsea, is to be sold by auction
in the course of this month. There are many reports as to the probable
purchasers. The Corporation of London will—it is said-be among
the bidders; with the intention of converting the edifice into a

oans for all taxes whatever, adjourned,
Commons and the Opera, where they
stationed themselves on the carriages of noble lords and honourable gentlemen.
SEA-SIDE INTELLIGENCE.
THE Season at Ramsgate is at its height, and the bathing
is at its depth; though, if the latter were carried out to
a somewhat greater depth, it would be all the better, for
common decency, if that can be called common which is
somewhat rare on the sands at Ramsgate. The Library is
in full play, and the “favourite tenor from London” is in
full sing, warbling Ben Bolt to the captivated ears of middle-
aged young ladies in beehive hats, and other adjuncts to a
sort of second-childhood juvenility.
The Sea-side commerce is limited to a few trays of shell-
pincushions, a small bundle of white boas, with a somewhat
doubtful lot of Chelsea buns, and a parcel of brandy-balls.
An attempt has been made to introduce a new article of
trade, by a melancholy individual, who has been walking all
over the town, and all along the shore, with a tremendous
air of Fº horns, which he offers to everybody, but
or which nobody makes a bidding. It seems to strike the
public that the proprietor of the horns looks as if he really
did not know what to do with them, where to put them, or
how tº carry them, and no one, seems disposed to place
himself in the same dilemma. The man with the hornsis,
in fact, becoming rather an object of sympathy, for it is
the general belief that, if he should become worn out with
his eccentric burden, and were to offer to give the horns
away, nobody would be willing to relieve him of the very
conspicuous article by which he is constantly accompanied.
PENAL MASQUERADE.
IF anybody wants to make a fool of himself, one very
good way is to put on a mask and an absurd dress, and go
and dance therein at Drury Lane or Vauxhall. It is never-
theless possible to make a more foolish use of a mask and
a costume than this, by which amusement is sought, and,
by persons of weak intellect and depraved taste, obtained.
It is possible to dress other people in a ridiculous manner,
and to mask them, with a view to-their moral reformation.
This is what is done by the authorities who direct the
arrangements of the model, prison at Winchester. The
convicts detained in that gaol, besides being clad in prison
dresses, have masks affixed to their faces in going and
coming to and from their respective cells. However,
causing the rogues to wear a mask is consistent enough
with the Ticket of Leave system, which makes them
hypocrites.
THE THAMES AND ITS TRIBUTARIES.
To look at the many floating masses that make of the
hames, a perfect sink of corruption, one would imagine
that in London it never rained anything but literally “cats
and dogs,” and that they all found their way down to the
river.
A TOWN OF TREES.
WE learn from the Morning Post that—
“The trees in the Champs Elysées have just had numbers attached to them, similar
to those of the houses of the streets.”
On what principle the numeration of the trees in the Elysian Fields
of Paris has been decreed. our º contemporary omits, to
inform us. We could understand why it might, perhaps, be desirable
to number the trees in the Jardin des Plantes. Perhaps each
tree may be destined to afford a locus standi to some Parisian analogue
of apple and oyster stalls, lemonade, and ginger beer, and toy ditto, and
'taturs all hot:—a splendid little establishment to be º num-
bered, like a shop. In any abstract numeration of trees, we, for our
own part, can get no farther than No. 1, which is the British Öak.

SoMEBODY advertises a complete set of the
London Gazette, from 1810 to 1854, which is
offered to the attention of the literary world and
book-collectors in general. We dare say a pur-
chaser will be found, inasmuch as there is
scarcely anything that one person wishes to sell
which some other person is not prepared to buy,
at some price or other. We confess the collec-
tion does not offer much temptation to us,
though the work may suit the tastes of many.
Some would like to have it, from an ill-natured
desire to peruse the bankruptcies of the last
forty years, as there are some to whom the
intelligence of the misfortunes of others is always
agreeable. Others there are who would find
a less censurable satisfaction in reading the lists
of promotions, and becoming acquainted by
name, with all the peers, baronets, and knights
that have been created since the year at which
the collection commences. We hope the pur-
chaser of the work will favour us with his name
and address, for we should like to include him in

PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
August 6, Monday. BARON REDEspale, Wiscount CASINo, whose
residence is Moreton-in-the-Marsh, and whose motto is Stick in the Mud,
tried to prevent the introduction of the Amended Beer Bill, on the
ground that there was “no urgency” in the matter. , His Lordship's
appearance is so exactly that of a pious butler, that nobody was astonished
at his º contempt for the “poor creature, small beer;” but other
Lords thought that the demands of the people were always matter of
. * the bill was read a second time by 25 to 16, and has since
een passed.
In the Commons, the Criminal Justice Bill, a measure intended to
save accused parties from a long and demoralising imprisonment, was
of course, opposed by a lawyer, CHAMBERs, but read a third time; and
the Charitable Trusts Bill, which is designed to keep charities out of
Chancery, was also opposed, chiefly by lawyers, and had to be greatl
mutilated in order to save any part of it. The Commons have passe
what remains.
Tuesday. In the Lords, LoRD CASINo, of Stick-in-the-Mud, above
mentioned, actually came out again as an obstruction, and tried to
º the introduction of the Limited Liabilities Bill, but was beaten
y 38 to 14. On Thursday, LoRD CAMPBELl, tried to render the
measure as, useless as possible, by endeavouring to exclude “small
companies” from its provisions, but this ridiculous attempt was suc-
cessfully resisted.
The Lords passed the Turkish Loan Bill, LoRD ST. LEONARDs
having opposed it, on the previous night, and that unfortunate word
“solidairement” having again come under discussion. The LoRD
CHANCELLOR, thus admits, that, according to our usual way of managing
matters, England has got herself bound “jointly and severally,” while
France is bound “jointly” only; but CRAN worth adds that “it’s of
no consequence.” May be so, but we don’t want a Toots for Chan-
cellor, nor slovenly bunglers for treaty-makers.
In the Commons LoRD JoHN RUSSELL took the opportunity of
trying to put himself in a better position with the country, but had
better have held his tongue. He ed about the expensive character
of the War, about nothing having been done in the Baltic, and about
rs to the common cause in Asia, and about the propriety of ac-
cepting the last, Austrian proposal. He complimented the Turkish
º to Vienna as one of the “best informed men in
urope;” but, as Mr. Punch had the pleasure a short time ago, of
WOL, XXIX. H
recording the interview between the Turk and the Whig, the nation
will understand what LoRD John's opinion on the subject is worth.
Then he made a pathetic and sentimental harangue about the way in
which civil and religious liberty is outraged in Italy, and much of what
he said was very true; and, as the speech was merely an advertisement,
in case the nation should happen to want a Liberal statesman of philan-
thropic tendencies, Loºp John will be good enough to send, eighteen
and sixpence to our Office in return for our thus copying it. LoRD
PALMERSTON laid it rather well into M.R. GLADSTONE for his previous
peace-mongering, after having helped to get us into war; and he sum:
marily disposed of LoRD JoHN's twaddle by announcing that he should
rosecute the War with the utmost vigour, and that the opinion of the
rks was of no consequence, as it was for France and England to say
when enough had been done. He admitted the truth of the Italian
icture, and on Friday night, when that well-meaning but weak-minded
}. Catholic, MR. Bowyer, essayed a defence of the Ecclesiastical
Governments of Italy, PALMERSTON told him that the best thing he
could do for his clients, was to hold his tongue. As . Austria,
the PREMIER declared, rather significantly, that she might not fight for
us; but he would guarantee her not fighting against us. By a curious
coincidence, Kossuth happened at this very moment to be drinking the
health of MAZZINI.
MR.WERNoN SMITH, the King of India, brought forward his Budget in
the Commons, and showed (rather reluctantly) that the East India
Company has, for a set of City merchants, singularly mismanaged the
splendid country entrusted to them. They are in debt to the amount
of £2,600,000; a sham surplus has been previously exhibited, as a com-
mercial dodge; their accounts are confused and mystifying; and there
is no longer any hesitation in admitting that torture is employed in
police and revenue cases. The decisions of their local courts were
stated to be a mass of contradiction and folly; and, altogether, the
affairs § India present the strongest conceivable case for administra-
tive reform.
Wednesday. The Commons were engaged in working up the fag-ends
of measures, and generally clearing away for the recess.
Thursday. Rather a day to be noted. There was a bill called the
Leases of Settled Estates Bill, which some* thought would enable
SIR Thomas Wilson to steal Hampstead Heath. The promoters of the
bill said that this was not so, but there must have been some grounds
for the suspicion, or the law officers of the Crown would not have
introduced into the measure a new clause expressly pointed at ToMMr,
No. 736.

whose enclosing, movements people have learned to regard with a remarkably vigilant
§ After much discussion on the subject, the Leases Bill was thrown over altogether in
the Commons; so, whatever, ToMMY's º: may be, they have not been increased by
anything done in Parliament this year. . To Mr. Punch's solemn warnings, given some weeks
ago, this lucky escape is due. . He merely mentions it—not for applause—being in the habit of
saving the country only about once a-week, while the Tizer, according to its own statements
and those of its correspondents, saves the nation at least four times a-week, besides keeping
its eye on the beer-barrel.
IORD PALMERSTON being asked, whether Joseph HUME was to have a statue, replied that
he himself had made a speech in HUME's honour, which PAM evidently considered quite as
distinguished a tribute.
Friday. The LoRD CHANCELLOR said he would bring in the ToMMY WILSON bill the very
first thing next year, and the law Lords were pathetic about the rights of Lords of Manors.
This shows what was in the wind.
The Commons did what they could, and having
waiting for Bills from the Lords. Mr. Punch,

THE WORKING MAN'S GUIDE TO THE BRITISH MUSEUM.
THE British Museum is
open on Mondays, Wed-
nesdays, and . Fridays
gratuitously; however,
you will practically be
unable to avail yourself
of its advantages without
money. Its doors may
be open to you three
times a-week, but they
cannot admit you more
than twice in twelve
months. Except on
Easter Monday and Whit
Monday, you are hard at
work on every working
day throughout the year;
tinkering, tailoring, shoe-
making, hammering, saw-
ing, planing, chiselling,
centre-bit-driving, rasp-
ing, filing, bricklaying,
painting, plumbing-and-
glazing, and so on, as
the case may be. There-
fore, if you want to see
the British Museum you
must, as Iago tells Rode-
rigo, put money in your
purse. For, although you
may see it at Easter and
Whitsuntide, you will
see only it. You will see
it, and nothing but it; deuce a bit of anything it contains. You will be surrounded by a dense
crowd of people, who will make the place too hot to hold you in any comfort, Besides being
squeezed and jostled, you will be stewed in a close reeking atmosphere. That atmosphere
will contain a large quantity of carbonic acid gas and steam, which the multitude of men,
women, and children that you are jammed in have breathed out of their lungs. The carbonic
acid gas will stupify you, and render you incapable of attending to the objects of art and natural
history by which you are surrounded, even if now and then you succeed in forcing your way
through the crowd so as to catch a glimpse of them. -
It is not the circumstance of the people around you being working people that will make
the place close and unpleasant. When the aristocracy are crammed together the nuisance is
just as bad; and perhaps the worse for patchouli, and other things of the civet kind. The
skin does not exhale any products the less for being washed with Row1AND's Kalydor, and if a
dense mass of nobility were to keep breathing the same air, they would make themselves as
mutually disagreeable, quite, as a body of the labouring classes similarly situated. This
actually happens when t ºjº to Court at St. James's Palace, where they are penned up
together in a passage, and half stifle one another. ...Nobody can make any intellectual exertion
when he is half-stifled. You, in that condition, will be unable to tell a lion from a leopard, or
to distinguish the bones of an Ichthyosaurus from the skeleton of a Mammoth. What delight,
or instruction either, will you derive from the Greek and Roman sculptures, and the Egyptian
and Assyrian remains, you being in a state of semi-suffocation?
As aforesaid, then, put money in your purse. If you want to see the British Museum, make
money. Put by your wages. {}. the system of limited liability, perhaps you will be able
to invest them so advantageously as to realise, in some years' time, an income sufficient for you
to live upon without working. Then, it will be in your power to see the British Museum.
You must not expect to see it before then. You might, to be sure, see it on Sundays, if you
had a different sort of superior classes to legislate for you. You might inspect the leopards
and the lions, the Ichthyosauri and the Mammoths, the É. marbles, the Egyptian antiquities,
MR, LAYARD's bulls, and all the other wonderful works of art and nature contained in the
Museum, if the inspection of such objects on a Sunday were not a heinous sin, and if you were
not blessed with pious and holy betters, who prevent you from committing that sin; a sin first
7-
discovered by the Puritans of CROMWELL’s time,
whose doctrine on this point we follow !
How much happier you are than the French
They have no kind Peers and Members of the
House of Commons to restrain them from com-
mitting spiritual suicide by walking over the
Louvre on a Sunday. On the contrary, their
Government is so regardless of their true welfare,
so indifferent to their #. interests, as to
give them, % an act of despotic power, admit-
tance to the Paris Industrial Exhibition on that
holy day, which your more benevolent and en-
lightened rulers, by constitutional means, endea-
vour to oblige you to devote to the serious
contemplation of brick walls. How tender your
tº. are for your souls! They really seem
to love them more than their own. Witness the
carriages to be seen on Sundays at the gate
of the Zoological Gardens, and at the Star and
Garter at Richmond. It is their determination
that the working man shall never see the British
Museum but on a working day. Of course that
determination must be submitted to. Therefore,
again, put money in your purse, in order that
you may see the British Museum before you die
on a working day, or you will never see it.

To add to Thames' filth their own.

THE PROGRESS OF CANT.
. APPEALs in favour of all sorts of charitable
institutions with F. pretensions are flying
about the country by post, and in most of them
may be noticed the following words:–“Owing
to the failure of MEssrs. STRAHAN, PAUL, AND
Co., we suffer loss.”
“Birds of a feather flock together;”
and we cannot help feeling that in many in-
stances Cant has $º attracted by Cant, for
several prospectuses...we have seen are as tho-
roughly crammed with the verbiage of piety as
the mouths of the peccant bankers were stuffed
with the sort of phraseology that is usually
but improperly supposed tº denote religion.
We seriously recommend to all really charitable
institutions to abandon as soon as possible the
practice of filling their circulars with bits from
the Bible; for the public have been so nauseated
by the pious frauds and religious humbugs which
have recently been brought to light, that nine-
teen persons out of twenty consign, at once to
the waste-paper basket all documents in which
texts are sprinkled about with most obtrusive
lrreWerence.
Curious Phenomenon of Colours.
According to the evidence adduced before
the Adulteration Committee, it appears that
ickles are coloured by copperas; the result
eing, that the more the pickles are done green,
the more the purchasers thereof are done
brown.

two-and-twenty feet in extent, which may be supposed to leave avery wide
opening for conjecture, on the part of those who are distinguished for
their capacity to swallow anything or everything that is submitted to

of such dimensions must form a very important feature, and, indeed, a
solitary feature, for there can be little room for any other, as neither

Notice OF MOTION.—Early next session, MR. SchoºſeLD to move
for a Committee to inquire into the adulteration of materials that

HOW “PUNCH." IS TREATED IN RUSSIA.
JAMES CARR, an English workman, has written a brief but ve
intelligent account of his sojourn in the interior of Russia. Englis
newspapers are circulated with blank columns; “and so expert are
they,” says our workman, “that they, (i.e., the Russians,) can com-
pletely erase the º on one side without injury to the other.” The
writer supposes that this must be done with sand-paper, or something
similarl Happy John BRIGHT, he is so very clearly Russian that no
particle of sand is applied to him. It is otherwise with poor Punch;
or, says our travelled English workman:-
I have seen Punch so much disfigured, that the owner has not had as much reading
left as the breadth of his hand for his money.
That the Russians, can so, cleverly deal with facts that they can
erase “all one side of them” to their own advantage, has been again
and again shown; and never more clearly than in the Muscovite ver-
sion of the Hango Massacre. For Mr. Punch's own part, he cares
little for the application of the process of erasure; for he has this best
and sweetest consolation, that no matter how much Russian sand-
paper may be bestowed upon him, no quantity soever of such scouring
can ever make him-BRIGHT!
Red Coats in Court.
Inter arma silent leges. Not so, says LoRD CAMPBELL. He likes to
see red coats in a court of justice; “his nerves are strong enough to
bear the sight of them, and he hopes he shall not discharge his duty
with less comfort because of their presence.” There is an old circuit
toast, “the glorious uncertainty of the law.” Now red coats in court
will give a deeper significance to this toast; for contrasting with the
black of the bar, they may further illustrate the uncertainty of rouge-
et-noir.
CENES IN THE FESTIVE CIRCLE I-SIgnor Insomnus (the well-
known Tumbler), gives notice that he has again joined the Festive Circle, in which
he has so often figured, and is happy to state that, during the Crab and Lobster Season,
he will as usual go through his daring Evolutions on the celebrated WILD STEED or
THE PAMPERs, known all over the world as the Furious Nightmare.-N.B. For terms,

So Punch, your weekly Mentor the dreary session through,
From this jovial circle's centre has a few last words for you.
For jaunty PAM, and warlike PAN, for LANspowNE wise and old :
For you, my gallant youngsters, ARGYLE and GRANVILLE bold—

For you, men of the future—for you, men of the past.
For the last time the Lords’ Order has to the wall been thrust
To the wrath of my LoRD REDESDALE and my LoRD GREY’s disgust.
From the pocket of John BULL–that milch-cow that ne'er goes dry,+
You have wrung, with dexterous squeeze, some more runnings of supply.
The last Bill has been rattled through at twenty knots an hour,

With their marimum of committees and their minimum of debate,
The concluding month of work crowns the previous five of prate.
Now M.P.'s about their business of pleasure have been sent;
Parler and mentir join no more to make up Parliament.
The time of words is at an end, the time of deeds begun:
There is a pause from making laws to getting work well done.
Let me warn you of last winter, of the fate of ABERDEEN;

Yet willing, as she was, and is, and will be to the last.
That cry, this winter, will raise more than motions in the House:
The mountain may breed earthquakes, when you look but for a mouse.
Look to it, merry ministers, a distant thunder rolls,
Where bolts may not be conjured by points or protocols.

Though in your eyes he wear the guise of a perfect gentleman.
He must be chain'd, and ſetter'd fast within his northern den-
This is no play for lordlings, but it is work for men.
The right hands must be found for this, though horny hands they be—
The right words must be used for this, though they lack courtesie.
The country's heart is great, the country's eye is wide— -
Obey you what that heart suggests, go where that eye doth guide.
The wind is sow'd—you deem'd it but a petty eddy's sweep:
Look out such gear as they must use who the whirlwind have to reap.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHURCHYARD CLAY.
It is not enough that
Churchman and Dissent-
er, lying in the church-
A yard, should have become
so much clay—they must
have a barrier of clay
between them. Bishops
do fight for bricks!
Hence, LoRD EBRING-
Ton, who just now seems
to have quite a rash of
liberality broken out upon
him, proposed a clause
in the Burials' Bill, “pro-
viding that it should not

burial-ground of any
parish to do more than

of demarcation had been
made between the parts
intended for the inter-
selves to themselves,” by a deep foundation of brick, or
the wall is a delusion; a mere flam of burnt clay, in no
manner carrying out the purposes of Christianity.
MR.W. J. Fox spoke against any wall soever: a wall
would be “unseemly in the extreme!” But this it is to be
a liberal! When how much real *:: would not only
have a wall between the established dead and the dead
dissenting, but a wall surmounted by a stout, strong
cheraur-de-frise?
SIR GEORGE GREY gave assuring comfort to certain
members, pained by certain doubts. There was no fear
that the dead would be otherwise than piously interred.
For “if clergymen buried the deadin unconsecrated ground
they violated the feelings of the members of the Church of
England, and "-and this is a penalty—“and deprived
themselves of their fees;” a dºm hardly to be
thought of... That earth, is only consecrated that yields
money; it is no Christian burial-ground, unless it also
partakes of the qualities of gold and silver mines.
Now, if there must be lines of demarcation, why not
mark them iniines of flowers? Why not let the final bed
of the Churchman and the bed of the Dissenters be sepa-
rated º a bed of heartsease; a line of forget-me-nots; a
strip of amaranth? And here and there º of grace?
But no, as the bill has passed, the Bishops may insist
upon a wall—so much toleration in burnt clay. The
Germans have a good name for a churchyard; Gottesacker

opinion, must bear a standing crop of bricks.
ment of members of the
Church of England and
others.” Bishops, it
seemed, require walls to
separate the dead of the
Established Church from
the Dissenting deceased.
There is great conservative power in burnt bricks: and the established and dis;
senting dead will sleep the more soundly until the last day, if kept in peace and
quietness by the handiwork of the bricklayer! LoRD EBRINGTON, however, lost
his motion; and the Bishops take their triumphant stand upon a brick wall. The
uestion, nevertheless, remains unsettled, as to the depth of the foundation of
the wall. If it be not sufficiently deep to separate the sleepers, some of them
sleeping six, eight, may ten feet deep in the earth-it can have no conservative effect;
the dead, according to the Christian meaning of the act, must be kept “them-

In the meantime, should the Kaffirs revolt, it is suggested
that MR. Hughes should be sent out with his staff to put

A nation that suffers war might suffer a great deal worse
It is worse to crouch, and crawl, and be tongue-tied, than to fight.

THE LAUREATE'S VIEW OF WAR.
TENNYson, you are an eminent bard; there is none of more note;
You have sung some capital staves; for example, your Bugle Song,
Out of numerous noble lines which I wish 1 had room to quote.
But I think that some of your views propounded in Maud are wrong.
I shouldn't º: to War for “shaking a hundred thrones,”
Provided it left that one at Buckingham Palace firm.
But I hate and detest it, because of its breaking brave men's bones,
And rendering many true hearts of heroes a meal for the worm.
I do not compare the British Grenadier to a sordid wretch
For a suit of clothes and a guinea who chokes out another's breath;
I esteem that gallant hero as a quite sublime JACK KETCH,
Who risks his own precious life in putting villains to death.
But I grudge that brave man's blood; I think it a grievous thing
That in sweeping off vile Cossacks a drop of it should be lost;
I wish they could be destroy’d, as the felons at Newgate swing,
I cannot agree with you, that War is better than Peace, Machinery and rope comprehending all the cost.
Because in Peace time men lie, and rob, and cozen and cheat.
They will bam and bite the more as the Tax-man shears their fleece;
But the miscreants are too strong, and battle alone remains,
For nothing makes people thieve like the want of enough to eat.
The means of ridding the world of the CzAR's enormous gang,
And we are obliged to |. our purses and our veins,
To put the criminals down, whom we cannot contrive to hang.
Your “smoothfaced snubnosed rogue” has a large per-centage to pay
On the gains of his fraudulent trade; that’s the worst of the War to
him.
Were a shell to burst in his shop, do you think he would not run
away
As fast as he possibly could, out of danger of life and limb
But suppose such a snob could be, by the pressure of War's distress,
Compell’d, or induced, to chouse in a somewhat minor degree,
And suppose he turn'd out with a stick if the Russians were off
Sheerness,
Would that be worth the blood that we shed by land and sea?
Imagine your stomach pierced with the lange or bayonet's point;
Just ſangy your own inside with the bombshell's fragments torn,
Or a Minié bullet lodged in the middle of your knee-joint,
And a wooden leg, if you live, for the rest of your life to be worn.
I abhor this War as much as I should a plague or a blight,
I wish the loss of life and enormous expense might cease,
But the more with dogged rage for that very cause would fight
In hatred of horrible War, and the hope to conquer Peace.
A Bone to Pick with Lord John.
THERE appeared the other day in one of the papers a letter headed
with the words “LORD John's last stake.” We do not think the

RABELAIS IN THE CRIMEA.
How RABELAIs went back to the Palace of Sound, and how the people
therein did hold April Fools' day every day in the Season, likewise
of the gigantic Roe that butled everybody.
OUR ship, such as it was, progressed gallantly through the dead cats
and dogs, the sewers, the and tan, the suicides, old kettles, lamp.
leavings, bottles, tripe-cuttings, decomposed fish, condemned meat, and
the like delicacies, whereof this wondrous river doth consist, back again
to the great Palace of Sound. In the which palace people did seem to
me to grow more insane than ever; and, sooth to confess, had I one
hundred mouths, two tongues to each, a voice of iron, a heart of steel,
lungs of leather, and the heads of all the asses that go to a cabinet, yet
I never could give you even a fifth part of the nonsense I witnessed in
the great Palace of Sound.
For, no sooner had the great and famous Cat NIMRODUs, sat down,
than another frightful, but brave beast got up. And this was the
gallant Roe, who with his horns did buck, and poke, and butt, and gore
the same animals which the great Cat had just scratched so handsomely.
And he did º that all the asses ought to be turned out, as .#
to consort with the nobler beasts, and that the first thing was to fin
out who the asses were.
But as he that doeth wrong careth little for publicity thereupon, as
he that knoweth himself an ass writeth not down his title, so did our
worthy Long-Ears stick to their thistles, and prefer their own stable to
the public air. But they did bray in vain, for that the Roe, albeit he
was but weak in frame, did so lay about him, that they did jump about
from one thing to another, braying, lying, trifling, fiddling, playing at a
e called amendments, moving for nothing and ſº the supplies,
osing their temper, sucking oranges, biting their lips or their fingers,
playing at pitch and toss with soldiers, defending those who had nothing
to say for themselves, turning asses into horses, making moons out of
#. Stiltons, fancying people believed in them; and so did they divert
themselves and the nation with all manner of Jacks in the Green, sham
fights over which the great Bottleholder did preside (and which were
ways sold or crossed), jumping into sacks (for that many were forced
to go out), duck and drake with the people's money, shooting the long
bow about, public, services, making dirt pies out of other people's
honesty—all the which some did assure me, was because in the great
Palace of Sound, the First of April did last all the season round, for the
which reason they did seek to provide amusement for themselves and the
people—especially as they were right well paid for their performance.
And there was a something or other named, Whom-to-Hang, the
which did indite, write, and scribble certain rubbish to show that the
herd of asses and merry jesters were perfectly right, sound of wind and
intellect, and that a de lunatico was not required. And the Great
Bridlegoose did very aptly and fitly condemn the same Whom-to-
Hang, for that he was a greater ass than his brethren he sought to
defend—for that, being nobody, he had no feelings for men; for that
being an anonymous scribbler, he had blurred, dirtied, spoilt, and wasted
good wholesome paper, which might have been better used than in
spelling out the ungrammatical and illogical brayings of an ass.
And so the row went on, and the asses brayed, and the i. stood
on one leg, some with garters curiously devised, and everybody defended
everybody. But it was of no use, for the great Roe did so buck and butt
that the great Bull came to his help; and these same will, it is devoutly
in all, honour to be prayed, prove that, -when heaven, rains larks,
cathedral commissions are not fed on extra bishoprics, income taxes
are repealed, and the great flunkey JEAMEs speaks the truth or the
GADstone a word of sense, or when any other impossibility comes to
pass—the t and dangerous Roe will buck to some purpose; and the
asses will be ashamed of their own ears, and put up with a “people's
allowance” of their own thistles.
ROMAN DUCKS AND GEESE.
THE Paris correspondent of the Morning Post says:-
“I observe the Papal journals of Italy are continually spreading false reports about
the Sardinian forces in the Crimea. Sometimes they are beaten by the Russians, and
at others decimated by cholera. Such falsehoods indicate the spirit of Papal priest-
craft, which of pºssity sympathises even with orthodox Russia, rather than with
constitutional freedom."
The Pope is, always complaining of annoyances which “grieve his
paternal heart”, One of them, perhaps, is the habit indulged in by his
children upon the Italian Press, of telling lies in his interest. It
seems that Papal canards are not confined to Loretto flying-houses
and Riminiwinking statues. Of course, these “canards,” or ducks of
Popery, find some geese who believe them.
“Messrs. Bright and Co." translated.
“MessRs: BRIGHT AND Co.”—writes the intelligent author of the
article in Blackwood on Russia—are very popular with the bigoted
national party. Their speeches are translated, and they are exhibited
“as the only true expositors of the feelings of the majority of the people
of England.”. In answer to this, Mr. Punch begs to assure the people
of Russia, that John Bull disclaims all and every connection with John
BRIGHT, alias JoHN MuscoBRIGHT.

of the same age, affords proof that a certain instinctive capacity for routine can
exist, independently, of brain. Everybody knew that such a faculty might be com;
patible with very little brain, but few were aware that, it could be exercised
irrespectively of any brain at all. It may be questioned by some people whether
this child, had it grown up to man's estate without brains
might not have been as dexterous in the manipulation o
Red Tape and as well adapted to that employment as most
of the officials in Downing Street. Of course the routine
of functions performed during the first ten days of life
is very simple, and, with the exception of squalling, which
requires lungs and larynx, demands no organisation superior
to that of an oyster. As more than ten days generally elapse
before babies begin to “take notice,” it is not likely that
this one differed from the majority by exhibiting any
more than the average intelligence of that mollusc.
JUSTICE UNJUSTLY TREATED.
THE time of Parliament has been occupied on a measure
bearing the name of the Criminal Justice Bill. What is the
meaning of Criminal Justice? If it is Justice, it is surely not
Criminal; and if it is Criminal, it is undoubtedly anythin
but Justice. We think, all the judges of the land shoul
meet together with all the magistrates and demand an
inquiry into the application of the epithet Criminal to the
word, Justice. If there is any Justice who, ought to be
called Criminal let his crime be brought to light, and let
the Justice be brought to Justice, that is to say, let him
be brought to himself, at the earliest opportunity. Until
this point is settled there is not a Justice from the Lord
CHIEF JUSTICE of the Queen's Bench, to the humblest
Justice of the Peace, who will not feel the peace of the
Justice disturbed by the imputation alluded to,
Delicate Attention of the King of Naples.
WE learn that on the occasion of the visit of the KING OF
PoRTUGAL to Naples, all the i. were put in prison.
Very delicate this of the much-abused KING of NAPLEs.
Knowing how much º had been º upon
families by Portuguese Bonds, his Majesty of Naples
would not awaken unpleasant memories in the sensitive
bosom of Portugal's sovereign.
MR. GLAT)STONE'S PEACE SONG.
HEAR, Europe, and especially hear, Russia, what I say!
An honourable chance of peace England has thrown away.
Hear me proclaim my countrymen the foes of all mankind.
Pig-headed, proud, vindictive, greedy, quarrelsome, and blind.
It is not you, my Russian friends, that now the war prolong,
It is the § and the French, and they are in the wrong;
Reverses too, yes, that 's the word, reverses they have met
In the Crimea; and will meet with worse reverses yet.
The Government of Britain is by far the more to blame,
'Tis dragging the French after it to play a desperate game,
And sink down, down, for ever, into Ruin's dark abyss,
Defeated and dishonour’d, 'mid a European hiss.
Ho, Russia, holy Russia! who thy warlike hosts can count P
Thy destiny it is to rule º and paramount,
Go forth and conquer, mighty CzAR, for strong is thy right hand,
Woe to the Anglo-Saxon slaves if thee they still withstand!
They for an abstract shadow fight—the freedom of the world-
Thou in Religion's sacred name thy war-flag hast unfurl’d:
Against the Champion of the Church all human arms are weak.
The Church: I mean the Roman Church, and also mean the Greek.
Thy warriors are a martyr-band whose progress nought can stop;
They march—not certain miles a day—they'll march until they
drop :
Ini. are they of pain; incapable of fear. -
What chance is there against them for the British Grenadier?
The people all are patriots; they’ll spend their last copeck
That º mayst place thy †: foot on prostrate England's
neCº.
They from no sacrifice will shrink, for no privation care,
A few more taxes will exceed what Englishmen can bear.
Snap, then, thy fingers at thy foes, thou nothing hast to fear;
Thy triumph is assured if thou wiſt only persevere:
And that thou wilt, for thou art firm as well as good and wise,
And overthrow thine enemies, and smite the blind Allies.
Before them is the winter: where they are they must remain,
And there they’ll have to undergo another cold campaign:
The British troops again will want, again will starve and rot,
Although we peaceful Peelites in the Cabinet are not.
Oh, that the horrors they endured had, as I hoped they would
Qur people taught that to contend with Russia was not good i
We did our best to teach them that—our best are doing now:
These are the sentiments I own: this purpose l avow !
I am thankful for the liberty accorded to my tongue,
And patience which the House has shown throughout the song I’ve
Sung;
And &#d will another time return me—I’m in hopes—
To do the business of the CzAR, and also do the Pope's.
FROM CREMORNE TO THE CRIMEA.
A corresponDENT of the Times, under the signature of N. R., has
suggested that, in order to make plans of the interior defences of
Sebastopol, and surveys of the neighbourhood up to Simpheropol, a
“veteran aéronaut” should be engaged, and sent out to the Crimea
with his balloon. , N. R. points out that the balloon might be sent up
on a calm day, out of range of the enemy's rifle shot, and retained in
its position by a long wire cord and a windlass, when an engineer with
his “spy-glass”, and other appliances could accomplish the desired
object. This really seems to be a very feasible proposition, and accord-
ingly we have the strongest reason for expecting that it will not be
attended to.
PHYSIC FOR THE PHARISEES.
THE amended Sunday Act relative to}. is very distasteful
to the Sabbatarians; who, notwithstanding, or ratherin consequence of
its mitigated severity, consider it, seriously, a Bitter Beer Bill.

SHALL JOSEPH HUME HAVE A STATUE!
MR. WILLIAMs, member for Lambeth, has ſº put this
timely question to the PRIME MINISTER, and his Lordship,
by his manner of answer, would imply that the Government
only need a little gentle pressure, on the matter. The old
woman wholives in the Lane of Shoe asks, “What right has
Joseph HUME for a place among the worthies of West-
minster Hall?” Anyway, the right, of exception; for
exception, that ordinarily proves the rule, in Joseph's case
proves the triumph of the Rule of Three. HUME has richly
earned his statue. Let twopence in the º for every
pound saved by HUME to the country, be taken towards
the cost of the statue, and we might have a statue, not of
marble, but of gold.
A WOICE FROM HOUNDSDITCH.
HoundsDITCH has its feelings, Petticoat Lane is sensitive as the
polished mirror to the breath of calumny, and Rag Fair is ready to faint
at the slightest imputation on its character. Somebody happened to
hint the other day, that the display of pocket-handkerchiefs in Petticoat
Lane might possibly include a few that had left the pockets of their
owners in an unlawful manner, when a body of Jews rushed sorrowfully
forth from the East to the West, and proclaimed in touching lan #.
their scorn of a dirty action—of a doubtful pocket handkerchief. #: e
deputation of Hebrews is to be believed, there is not the smallest trans-
action in Petticoat Lane which is not conducted on the highest
rinciple of integrity. Every article is scrupulously traced in its course
rom the manufactory to the Judaical door-post where it is exposed for
sale, and there is not a Bandanna admitted into the pure precincts of
Rag Fair without an elaborate pedigree. Of course there is no possi-
bility that a handkerchief should be described as got by Lightfinger
out of Pocket, and it is the general presumption of the Jewish tradesmen
that every little unchin who produces some “half-dozen best Indian,
worth 5s. 6d. each,” which he is ready to dispose of at sixpence a-piece,
is only some eccentric juvenile who is desirous of reducing, his pocket-
handkerchief establishment, which he has of course formed in a purely
legitimate manner. -
..We confess that we cannot expect society to º: yery deeply
with Houndsditch in the distress it professes to feel at the imputations
lately thrown on its commercial character.
Drunkenness at Bow Street.
On Thursday, a German appears before MR. HALL, at Bow Street:
“MB. HALL. Were you sober?

DISCUSSION ON DR, WATTS.
An interesting literary question has arisen in º: of the fol-
lowing lines having been quoted in the Times from DR. WATTs, with
a passing remark on their somewhat ungrammatical character:-
“Let dogs delight to bark and bite,
For 'tis their nature to.”
AMR, or MRs. A. L. Cope, of Peckham, has addressed a letter to
our leading contemporary, stating the belief that the lines were written
by DR. WATTs thus:–
“Let bears and lions growl and fight,
For 'tis their nature too.”
the line about the dogs commencing the verse, which consists of four
lines; the second line concluding with the word “so.” Now, cer-
tainly, this is the ordinary modern reading, and it is true that the writer
in the Times has put the dogs in the place of the bears and lions; but
our impression is, that in the early editions of DR, WATTs's poetry, at
least in those familiar to us, in early years, the last line of the verse
stood precisely as it was cited in the Times:-
“For 'tis their nature to.”
Besides, by the substitution of “too” for “to,” DR. WATTs is only
exonerated from the charge of having committed one blunder, by being
represented to have perpetrated another. “Too” cannot be brought
to rhyme with “so,” except by the pronunciation of “so "as “soo.”
In no dialect with which we are acquainted, has the adverb in question
any such sound; whereas, in that of some dissenting ministers,
the other adverb, “to,” is homophonous with the noun-substantive
“toe: ” and the circumstance that DR, WATTs was a Nonconformist
Divine, may seem to favour the supposition that “to,” pronounced as a
perfect rhyme with “so,” is the correct reading.

JUST GIVE MY WELLINGTONs A Good Polish, cos I LIKEs
THE WORKMAN'S PROMENADE CONCERT.
ON the evening of Sunday how pleasant to stray
In Kensington Gardens, and hear the band play,
With my leisure amused, and my feelings refined,
And with tranquil enjoyment elated in mind!
At that time, on that day, I shall seldom be seen,
With my pipe and my pot on the public-house green,
I shall not very often spend that afternoon
In continual exertions to fill a spittoon.
But what shall I do when the summer is o'er,
And the band will perform in those Gardens no more?
When church hours are finish’d why should there not be
Sunday concerts on purpose for people like me?
Let the music be sacred, and sacred I call,
Not parochial psalm-tunes, but good music all,
Such as quiets the troubled, and cheers the distrest,
And on Sunday would set a chap's spirit at rest.
I feel, when I hear certain pieces and airs,
Just the same as I should in attending to prayers;
And think time so employ'd is almost as well spent
As it would be in hearing a Reverend Gent.
But music.’s expensive, mayhap some will say,
And you’ll have the piper on Sunday to pay;
That scruple on my mind weighs not in the least;
Why not pay the Piper as well as the Priest?
And even º: I paid to go in,
Can any man look upon that as a sin,
Any more than what church-goers frequently do,
Namely, giving a bob for a place in a pew.
It will come in good time; and I hope that the move
In the right way now made a beginning will prove,
It is a concession—keep rolling the ball—
And let us give thanks to SIR BENJAMIN HALL.
PUNCH*S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
August 12, Saturday. (St. 3. The Lords, deplored that the
Commons had mutilated the Charitable Trusts Bill, but their Lordships
vanquished their grief sufficiently to assent to the mutilations. The
Limited Liability Bill, which had been a good deal altered by the
Lords, was then passed. LoRD LANspowNE, (as a Member of the
Government) tendered his thanks to the Peers for the amendments
#7 had been kind enough to introduce. A few minutes later, the
Bill was carried down to the Commons, where LoRD PALMERston, (as
another Member of the Government) said that the amendments were
very objectionable, but that it would be better to accept them than
risk the loss of the measure. ... After this pleasing instance of Cabinet
unanimity, both Houses adjourned, the Lords until Monday, the
Commons until Tuesday.
Monday. The Law Lords expressed a great deal of wrath at the way
in which the SoLICITOR-GENERAL had spoken of their free-and-easy man-
ner of hearing appeals. They vindicated themselves from the charge of
being a Court of terminer sans oyer, asserting that they very often
listened to what was going on, that sometimes one of them told
another what had been done in his absence; but the best defence was,
that counsel said the same thing over and over again so often, that
anybody, who would look in and remain for any reasonable time, must
know enough to enable him to decide the case.
LORD CAMPBELL expressed his particular desire that soldiers might
be allowed to attend in the Assize Courts, and the Chancellor added,
that he had once let in some soldiers at Chester, and that they were
most quiet and attentive auditors. All this was the merest clap-trap,
a springe which John LoRD CAMPBELL is thought to be always ready
to set. He added some utter nonsense to the effect, that “the con-
nection between the judicial bench and the military was more intimate
than was imagined by some persons.” Very intimate of course. The
soldier puts tº. in his gun, and the judge in his wig; the soldier
kills people by ; them, the judge by hanging them; both have
serjeants constantly before their eyes; the judge is a judge of assize,
and the soldier is a man of a size too, and often a good size; the soldier
charges a foe, and the *}. charges a jury; and in short they are as
alike, as . possible, and LoRD CAMPBELL deserves great credit for
enlightening the nation as to the interesting fact.
Tuesday. The Commons met, to be ready to receive their dismissal.
SIR I)E LAcy Evans made yº. use of the interval by a speech
upon the conduct of the War. He showed that the Army ought to be
strengthened, and how; and especially recommended the employment of
a Polish Legion, and the bringing a portion of our Indian forces to the
scene of war. . LORD PALMERSTON reiterated his pledge that the War
should be carried on vigorously.
The Black Rod was then held up, and the Commons scuttled away,
and up the long passage, into the House of Lords, where
The coup-de-grace was given to about as useless a Session as the
annals of our £ja. record. HER MAJESTY, as Mr. Punch inti-
mated would be the case, stayed away, but sent the CHANCELLO
ARGYLI, HARRowBy, GRANVILLE, and STANLEY, of Alderley, to get ri
of the Parliament. This they did in rather a meat speech, in which the
nation was not insulted by any particularly bad grammar, and in which
the small achievements of the Session were dwelt upon with consider-
able fluency of º; The War paragraph is, however, worthy
of being lifted out of the limbo, of oblivion, in which most speeches,
royal, and popular, are deservedly interred, and of receiving the dis-
tinguished honour of being used by Mr. Punch as an embodiment of his
own patriotic sentiments, and as a conclusion to his own inimitable
summary of the Session:

A SOCIETY OF HATTERS.
THERE seems to be nothing for which men will not
associate, for there is no object, however apparently absurd,
in which numbers are not ready to co-operate. Some are
drawn together by the sympathies of the heart, others are
attracted solely by the head, and of the latter class we
may consider the Hatters, who have, it seems, formed a
society. A hat reform has long been wanted, and fre-
quently asked for by the thinking portion of the public,
and we would gladly take off our present hats with a
respectful obeisance to any individual, or to any society
who would give us something more tasteful as a sub-
stitute for the existing order of chapeau. The Hatters'
Society took an excursion the other day to Erith, and
mustered 1800 strong, so that the body is evidenti
owerful enough to mould the hat into a new form, an
o crown itself with glory, by crowning the British public
with something more sightly than the head-gear which at
| present disfigures the community.
THE LADIES' PEW-COMPANIONS.
THE RIGHT MAN IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
SEBASTOPOL IN LEICESTER SQUARE.
To see Sebastopol it is not necessary to go abroad; it is enough to
travel to the foreign quarter of London only. This journey has been
performed by ourselves. We have been to see MR. BURFORD's Panorama
of '...} in Leicester Square, and recommend all our readers who
are within reach of it to do themselves the same pleasure. The London
“season” being now over, there are few places either of instruction or
entertainment remaining open, and this is a place of both. Moreoyer,
as Rank and Fashion have for the most part left Town, the possibility
of seeing all that is to be seen in the Panorama—to wit, very much-is
likely to be increased by some diminution of the hitherto attendant
crowd of the nobility, gentry, and clergy. There will be less danger
than there has been heretofore of having one's corns crushed by a duke,
of being hustled by an earl, or elbowed about and squeezed by peer-
esses and maids-of-honour, the bulk of a bishop being, in the meanwhile,
interposed between one's eye and the canvas. , However, to secure a
good view of the exhibition, it may be advisable to go early in the
morning, while Rank and Fashion are at breakfast, or late in the after-
noon, when Rank and Fashion are at dinner.
Sebastopol is depicted as firing and under fire, and the first impression
derived from the view of the “beleaguered city,” presented by MR.
BURFoRD, is that of astonishment at the preternatural stillness, com-
paratively speaking, of the scene. Comparatively speaking, because a
considerable noise is being made by MRs. MAJoRM'GAB, or some other
military lady, who is sure to be present, and to be explaining the
positions of the Allies with commanding gestures, in a loud voice.
Astonishment, because the picture has such an air of reality, and the
smoke of the bombardment looks so particularly natural, as to make you
wonder at not hearing the artillery's roar and the crack of the rifles.
The visitor finds himself situated, with reference to the Crimea, pre-
cisely as, with allowance for change of circumstances, he would be with
regard to London if he were on the top of St. Paul's: except that the
objects below him do not seem so distant, and that the smoke of the
ordnance does not obscure the prospect like the smoke of the chimneys.
He sees the bays and harbours that surround the Crimean coast, the
Allied Fleets, the enemy's vessels, as many as have not been sunk, and
the mast-heads of those ; and all the forts and batteries—the Mamelon,
Malakhoff, Redan, Flagstaff, Quarantine, Constantine, Nicholas,
wei, is in course of being announced under the title
of Woman's Devotion. We have not read this work, but we
ean form some idea of the nature of its contents, Travelling
in an omnibus the other day, we observed an advertisement
at the back of the vehicle, offering to the religious public—
“THE GUINEA FAMILY BIBLE, bound in best
orocco, with Plates.
“THE HALFGUINEA WELVET CHURCH SERVICE,
with best Gilt Rims, and clasps.
“THE HALF-GUINEA FAMILY MOROCCO BIBLE
with References, Maps, Gilt Rims, and clasps."
We suppose that these fancy Bibles and Prayer-books
are designed for instruments of “Woman’s Devotion.”
The advertisement is, doubtless, particularly addressed to
the more serious sex, to whose innocent insensitiveness
of incongruity a Bible might be expected to seem as
suitable for ºf as a Bonnet: and the designation of
the Scriptures and the Liturgy by coins of the realm would
not, probably, appear Alºf
y
Alexander, Star, and so forth :
head-quarters of the Generals, together with a number of other objects,
which, recalled to, his mind's eye, will enable him to read the Times
every morning with the advantage of illustrations.
There is somebody present (besides MRs. MGAB) who will oblige
the company with any information they may desire in reference to the
particulars of the Panorama.
It is not too much to say, that those who visit MR. BURFoRD's
Sebastopol will see more of that City than they would if they were
stationed before the CzAR's : for the Panorama was painted some little
time ago, since when a great many of the buildings represented in it
have been demolished: and we hope the time will very soon come when
the only correct picture of Sebastopol will be the accurate likeness of
certain heaps of rubbish.
There is one very important difference between the prospect of
Sebastopol held out by M.R. BURFoRD, and that afforded by the Govern-
ment—and paid for by the tax-payers. The Downing Street one is
rather expensive: that in Leicester Square will cost nobody more than
a shilling.
THE MINISTERS A CUP TOO LOW.
AMoNg, the after-dinner doings last week, at the Ministerial White-
bait ...; was the “presentation of a china cup to MR. HAYTER.”
The reports do not inform us whether the china cup was a tea-cup, a
coffee-cup or an egg-cup; but whichever of the three it may have been,
the material—which is in every respect the material point—was of a
brittleness which does not say much for the confidence of the donors in
the stability of the Ministry. Qf course the gift was considered to be
appropriate, and we hope therefore that the china was without a flaw,
for if otherwise it might be said that the Ministry is slightly cracked,
or that there is a split in the Cabinet. We have seen no account of the
speeches delivered on the occasion, nor indeed would it have been quite
fair to report exactly what, the Ministers over their cups may have
uttered. "We cannot | feeling that MR. HAYTER deserved some-
thing more than a mere china cup for the services he has performed;
and we think everybody will admit, that if his colleagues could not have
gone the length of giving him a tea-pot, they might at least have made
it a milk-jug.

How RABELAIs, in the Island of Sound, did anatomise and describe the
great beast SESSION,
As for the inward and outward parts, or close-cabinet-down-with-the-
opposition developments, of the great beast SESSION, they were pretty
much as follows:–
His head was like a barber’s block stuffed with woolsacks.
His brain was made of addled eggs and Vienna diplomacy,
His neck, of a gallows of public opinion.
His shoulders of other people's work.
His arms, of doing nothing all the week, and no beer on Sundays.
His hair, of a BROUGH AM-stick.
His chest, of a Chancellor of the Exchequer and a breviary.
His heart, of a leather strap.
His conscience, of an India-rubber purse,
His legs, of the knaves of Clubs.
His feet, of other men's shoes,
His toes, of a treadmill for young thieves.
His teeth, of opera ivories,
His gums, of red tape.
His tongue, of the ghost of chaos.
His fingers, of a banker's trowel.
His nails, of clenches.
His eyes, of blind puppies.
His ears, of other men's wit.
His smelling apparatus or nose, of rats and Thames’ water.
A continuation of SESSION's countenance, posture-making, and
manner of behaving:—
When he opened his mouth, the truth was shut up in a box.
When he pºyed, it was new bishops and Kentish rag-stone.
When he “fixed his eye” it was “bull’s” fixings and smiles.
When he told the truth, the birds fell off the trees when you shook
em.
When he was in a fighting humour, coals went to Newcastle and
came back again.
When he was religious, it was raw lobsters and wooden staves.
When he dined, it was off skinned eels.
When he #. an alms, it was the shadow of a skinned flint.
When he fought, it was with spiked guns and broken pickaxes.

THE DANGERS OF PLAYING AT WAR.
WAR is not a thing to be trifled with, and its horrors are much too
real to be the legitimate subjects of burlesque, or any other kind of
mockery. The nearer the imitation approaches to the real thing, where
an imitation of war is concerned, the more distasteful it must be to all
persons of common sense, and common humanity. The mania for con-
verting the horrors of war into a subject of amusement for the
million, has received a somewhat sad lesson in the accident that has
lately º: at Cremorne Gardens; where, for the benefit of some
charity, there was to be a mock representation of the Battle of Inker-
mann. There was all the usual pride, pomp, and circumstance of
in-glorious (theatrical) war; and, to give “reality” to the business, a
dreadful reality it turned out, some of the Guards were “allowed by the
authorities” to take part in the spectacle...Of course, the only real
element in the business was incompatible with all the shams of which
it was made up; and, amidst the sham fortifications, the sham defences,
the sham barricades, and all the other gim-crack appurtenances of a
sham-fight, the real soldiers tumbled to the ground from a height of
some twenty feet with terrible reality.
. Of course, when it is tºo late, everybody is exclaiming against the
impropriety of .# the Guards to take a part in these caricature
copies of the horrors of war; in which everything is purposely made to
eld, from the pasteboard ramparts, to theshilling-a-night supernumerary
ſ: The sort of enthusiasm that is excited, among the soldiers,
by an imitation attack on an imitation enemy, in the teeth of imitation
fire from imitation batteries, is not likely to be of much service in the
hour of real battle, when there is no stage-director ordering the enemy
where to fall back, and leading on the British troops to the point
where, by previous arrangement, they are destined to be victorious. A
panorama of Sebastopol is all well enough, and a pictorial represen-
tation of the siege may be made a matter of interest; but an attempt to
show the actual storming of a place with real troops, must always be
a melancholy, and, indeed, a feeble spectacle. Nothing can be better
than the picture now being exhibited at the Surrey Zoological Gardens;
but the moment the action begins, and the firing of the guns
sets the ducks quacking in the lake, while the º of the band
drowns, on the whole, the occasionally heard cries of "Now Dick, set
fire to that tow,” “Ready there with them red lights?” “Off with them
fireworks,” and other stage-directions of a kindred character, the whole
affair becomes ridiculous. - - - -
Considering the trouble and anxiety in the public mind on the subject
of the Siege of Sebastopol, it is a ghastly mockery to be told that it, is
being taken triumphantly every night, and sometimes twice a-day (for
there have been occasionally morning Fº at the Surrey
Zoological Gardens. Let the directors of places of public amusement
confine themselves to legitimate subjects of entertainment,...of which
there are quite enough, without resorting to dismal travesties of the

ADULTERATION OF GOVERNMENT.
Lord John Russell, Politi-
call)ruggist, late of Vienna,
stated that he had had con-
siderable experience in the
practice of adulteratio
more particularly in politi
drugs. Had examined seve-
ral samples of Whig Govern-
ment, and found them al
perfectly pure, bsolute
purity in mºst cases was
º, unattainable, but the articles
is he had exercised his micro-
scopic skill upon were as
free from deleterious matter
as they could be, and he
doubted strongly, if they
were made . º
whether the people of this
country would like them
half so well. He had found
the specimen marked “Re-
form Bill” extremely diffi-
cult to analyse. TÉ diffi.
culty principally. # m
*scertaining precise y its
‘constituent” parts. He
had been several years, in-
tent uponsolving its various
antagonistic elements, and
he should persevere several
years longer, until he clearly
saw a proper settlement of
them, though as one of the Old School, he was strongly averse to, precipitating
anything. Decidedly in all Governments a little adulteration was desirable, and
he could rººfnothing better for the purpose than a few grains of Whig's
Paradise, better known in the trade as “Eliott's Entire.”. About twº or three
dozen of these tender sprigs generally gave the ministerial mixture a fine bitter
flavour, which made it go down wonderfully with the multitude, and did, harm to
nobody. Had examined a packet of Whig statements, and had detected in them
no colouring-matter whatever. Strongly believed that Whig F. had never
been adulterated since the days of Magna Charta. Purity of representation was
decidedly requisite to ensure a good constitution, and he begged to differ from
that great authority, MR. CoPPock, whose wonderful laboratory at the Reform
Club for the manufacture of votes was well known, inasmuch as, it was his
conviction that purity of representation did not necessarily require a large deposit
of tin. Brass would do just as well, and in many cases went further. For instance,
a few brass filings from some of the strongest pillars of the aristocracy were
notoriously a capital thing for purifying the most corrupt channels of Government:
Had repeatedly analyseſ the votes of the House of Commons, and never found
anything but the purest motives in them. Had no particular test of ability, save
DEBRETT's Peerage, and never knew that to fail. - - -
The Right, Hón. B. DisrAELI.-Had principally devoted his time to the
manufacture of retorts. He had brought them to the highest state of perfection,
and his retorts were celebrated all over the world for discharging a greater number
of sparks consecutively, than any other. Their brilliancy would often, illumine
an entire House. Had often tried the power of his retorts on the Whigs, but
they were such a dense body, that they had failed in making º: of an im-
pression. The result of his analytical inquiries had all tended to one uniform
result, viz., that Whig Government was a regular drug in this country, a drug so
largely adulterated, that it could not be allowed for * length of time without
doing the greatest injury to the strongest constitution, The only remedy, he knew
was astrong infusion o º Politics. Had submitted the principles of the Peace
Party to analysis, and had detected in them a deleterious colour called “Drab,”
mixed up in large quantities with a popular fraud, of a pale transparent colour,
called “GLApstone,” which had been recently imported to a painful extent from
St. Petersburg. He had applied the microscope to this “GLADstone,” and, after
reducing him to an impalpable powder, had succeeded in detecting in it, in the most
tangible portions of its secret nature, a large preponderance of “Jesuit's Bark;"
and, though he had divided this Bark into º: heads—as though the Bark in
question belonged to Cerberusſº laugh)—still he had not found much to repay him
for the search in either head. He certainly had not been able to detect in the whole
composition of “GLAnstone” a single grain of sense (general expression of surprise).
This revelation might be a startling one, but still it was based upon the most
careful analyses, each one painfully arrived at, only after the most minute divisions
and sub-divisions of character. owever, the effect of this “Drab.” mixture was
unquestionably very enervating; and when administered in large doses, created
nausea, and moreover had the curious effect of making people quarrel. The most
* results were to be apprehended from a general use of this irascible
narcotic.

croachments on its strength. However, it was time that
a stop was put for once and for ever to the circulation
of such deleterious poisons, and a thoroughly healthy system
of government introduced for the moulishment of the people.

PITY FOR THE FOE.
WHILST, as patriots, we rejoice in the triumph of the
Allied arms at Sweaborg, as men we cannot but feel com-
passion for that suffering by which it has been attended on
the side of our opponents. MR. BRIGHT, MR. CoRDEN, SIR
JAMEs GRAHAM, M.R. GLADSTONE, and those who think
with them, that is to say the Greek firms, and the rest of
the philo-Russian party, have no doubt severely felt the
misfortunes of their beloved country. We should be happy
to suggest to them, any consolation, if we could think of
any; and perhaps it may comfort them to reflect that,
although Sweaborg was demolished without the loss of a
British or a French life, it is probable that the capture of
Sebastopol will not be accomplished without heavy loss on
the part of the Allies.
Attachments may be not the less sincere because they are
unaccountable; and the gentlemen above-mentioned may
have a predilection for Russia, just as it is conceivable that
they might be inclined to pet aboa constrictor. Russia,
indeed, is a boa-a great boa, as the fine young gentlemen
say—rejoicing in the alleged peculiarity of the amphisboena,
or serpent with two heads, one head at each end. The
Russian amphisboena has the superior head in the Baltic
and the inferior in the Black Sea, and a body curled half
round Europe, which the northern mouth and the southern
have opened to swallow. , Either head of the snake, how-
ever, has been considerably bruised, and we cannot help
expressing, the hope that both will be smashed, however
sincerely the Peelites and Manchester friends of the reptile
may sympathise with its agonies.

THE KING OF NAPLES ON THE CARPET.
% #i8turn anti nd 33dman re.
CHAPTER I.
CE upon a time (a very few years
ago) there reigned a certain Kin
(who, alack the day ! reigns still
talled FERDINAND, otherwise IL RE
BoMBA, of Naples. “See Naples
and die,” was a proverb that his
Majesty had often worked out upon
his faithful subjects. Now this
FERDINAND was a potentate of most
volcanic viscera, the very spit, saving
the reader's presence, of Wesuvius.
A King, much given to the stick
that was much given to his people.
He was withal a man of sport and
many humane accomplishments. He
could kill mosquitos like CoMMODUs,
and play upon the fiddle like NERO.
- . Now, it chanced one day, that this
excellent King, making a procession of himself through the rooms
of his palace, bethought him that the carpets thereof had become faded
and, for royal carpets, mighty threadbare. The Bourbon flowers had
sickened, and the moth, that spares neither the frieze of the peasant,
nor the coffin-velvet of the Emperor, the moth had devastated.
Whereupon, seeing these things, the superb and magnificent monarch
resolved within himself to have new carpets—carpets spick and span.
CHAPTER II.
“SEGRETARIo mio,” said RE BoMBA to his penman, “ straightway
write an order to that accursed heretical England;—for the Lutherans”
—and here his Majesty crossed himself—“the Lutherans can, it must
be confessed, do two things; truly they can grind razors, and they can
“Razors?” said the secretary; but ere he could add “your Majesty”
he was footed by a sudden movement of the royal muscles into the
extreme corner of the cabinet. -
“Cane!” (otherwise “dog!”) cried RE BOMBA-"Carpets!”
Whereupon the canine secretary gathered himself up on his ºf:
and like a dog returning to his seat, he sat him down, and pro ed
to write “carpets.” -
“Bestia /* cried RE BoMBA. “First, let painters be summoned;
and let the royal patterns be drawn and limned; and when this shall be
done, and we have ºś. then shall you write to the
Lutheran slave”—here his Majesty graciously spat—“and the carpets
be commanded.” - -
And in due season these things were done, even as the King had
given order.
ChapTER III.
A LovELY morning broke upon the Bay of Naples. The golden sun
The glittering dew! The azure heaven! The sapphire ocean'
There might be seen an English barque, cleaving the liquid field. The
Union Jack fluttered—to the eye of a Briton-defyingly from the peak.
Boldly, saucily, did that English vessel plough the main. She brought
up-she dropt anchor. She was straightway accosted by a boat of the
ing S.
That British craft was the H. bearer of the carpets woven by the
happy Lutheran, whom RE BOMBA, had delighted to honour. Now
the carpet-weaver—embracing his saddened wife, and kissing his happy
children—had quitted the soil of Albion to come, and in his own
person, to deliver and lay down, the royal ts. Perchance, too, the
sordid'dealer had brought with him a receipt for the royal ready-money.
Now the carpets were duly sent to the royal palace.
CHAPTER IV.
AN interval of six weeks is here supposed to take place; when a
British islander, of bilious and malevolent aspect—in the unalterable
opinion of a Neapolitan physiognomist, much attached to the Neapoli-
tan police-might be observed, with his dog, for every British islander
travels with a British bull-dog, pacing the sunny side of the Piazza
Reale. That bilious stranger was the lutheran t-maker, and hope

the carpets—the goods, as in his trade dialect he called those woven
fabrics—had been delivered to the King; and the King had vouchsafed
no word to the man whom with his royal commission he had delighted
to honour.
The islander—with a brutality that a love of truth compels us to own,
too much distinguishes the travelled Briton-resolved to write a letter
to the King. Yes: the sordid. Lutheran determined to tell unto RE
BoMBA, a bit of his carpet-dealing mind. With this thought, he took
his way to his Hotel. - - - - - - -
Arrived at his hostelry—his faithful dog still bearing him company—
he beheld at the door a waggon, blazing with the arms of Naples.
Now, in this van, or waggon, were the carpets returned to the carpet-
maker. Of averity, the carpet thrown back upon the carpet-maker's
hands.
chapter W.
It were vain to hope to paint the dismay, the rage, of the et-
maker. He called down not a shower of manna on the anointed head of
Bomba the King. He vehemently swore; but, with a craftiness that
characterised the tradesman, he swore in English. Whereupon, the
faithful servants of BoMBA the King let him swear his belly empty,
and arrested him not. - -
“What was wrong in the carpets?” “Did they think he'd be
swindled?” “He, a free-born Briton 1’’ ‘‘He, who was represente
in his own British parliament!” “He, who was never born to be a
slave!” “To come to Naples to be robbed—plundered-bamboozled
—and that, too, by a-a-’. - -
But, as we have said, felicitously for the ferocious Briton, he raved
and swore in his mother-tongue; and the officers and the King's
servants hindered him not. -
Of what availed it, that he commanded the muffins about him to
set him face to face with the Majesty of Naples! Of what availed it,
that he demanded to know in what whit, tittle, or particular, the carpets
differed from the order given. They were woven even as commanded;
and the arms of Bourbon and of Naples—- -
(The Bourbon arms'. How much blood has gone to paint them!
How much more blood of man, woman, and child; bloodin the dungeon;
blood at the wine-feast; blood on the scaffold; blood in the chamber,

air, will have more blood to keep it fresh. But, to return to our Briton,
perspiring, and ever, as he utters the sacred name of BoMBA the King,

The carpets were shot down at the door of the hostelry; they had
been looked upon by the eye of the King, and the King in his heart
spat upon them. - -
And now, the carpets being rejected of the sovereign, the law of
Naples required of the British islander to pay upon the British woven
fabrics the duty of import. The Briton had brought carpets into the
kingdom of Naples, and Naples was not to be fobbed of her due ; for it
is known that Naples has her duties, even as no Neapolitan has his
rights.
“Pay import duty Be robbed! No, the bold Briton would go to
prison. He would rot with pleasure, in a dungeon first.” And
then, exhausted º the expression of his unflinching firmness, the
Briton paid the cash.
Chapter Wi.
The Times newspaper, ſº by the stiletto of the Neapolitan
censor, lay upon the table of the Hotel Victoria. That sheet called up
all the home feelings of our wanderer. He looked at the “Births,”—
he knew not why, for he had no expectations. He read the “Mar-
riages,”—idleness all, for was he not already wedded? . He paused at
the “Deaths;” but somehow nothing cheered him. , And again and
again home-sickness pressed upon him, and he felt his heart-strings
twitched towards the sea.
He would É. he would shake from his polluted shoes the dust of

carpets, he must pay the state tax for the removal of the merchandise—
* the duty on export. - -
esuvius never poured forth streams more consuming in their fierce-
ness and fury than the volcanic Briton ejected at the paternal govern-
ment of Naples. -
No, he would not be swindled a second time; he would even at an
alarming sacrifice sell the carpets—sell them in the broad daylight by
public auction.
CHAPTER Wii,
THE day came. The mart was crowded. The º were
displayed; and great and general was the praise of the fabrics, glowing
like flowers. But of what use to the private modest Neapolitan citizen?
How could his foot trample upon the Bourbon arms? As well think to
put his shoe-leather on the anointed neck of Il RE BoMBA assoluto.
Who would raffle for an elephant? Who would put into a lottery
for a knot of rattle-snakes? Who would draw chances for a hippo.
Who, we ask, would bid for carpets—enriched and solemnised with
the Bourbon arms, the arms of Naples? Is there not constructive
treason in the yery thought of a bidding?
Even so. Hence, the carpets where put up, and no voice dared to
make an offer.
At last one man took courage. He made a bidding; a low and
modest bidding. But the auctioneer smiled, nodded his head, and was
satisfied; for to the amazement of the vulgar Briton, the auctioneer
knºcked down the carpets for an old song; and that a Neapolitan one.
And who was the fortunate purchaser Surely no private man—no
private woman? No.
The carpets were bought by an officer in the household of his sacred
Majesty BoMBA IL RE!

PALMERSTON'S BLAZE OF TRIUMPH !
THE COCKNEY MALAKEIOFF.
THE, storming of Sebastopol at Cremorne the other day, by the
Grenadier Guards and Artillery, seems to have been very much like the
real thing. Actual wounds and broken bones, at least, appear to have
attended that gallant affair, and if there was no mine under the soldiers’
feet to blow them up, it appears that they stood on a footing which
proved almost equally dangerous by letting them down. The brave
who, fell in the Crimea are more than sufficiently numerous, and
England cannot afford men to tumble at Cremorne, unless they do so
in the capacity of clowns and harlequins, and without the risk of
breaking their necks. ... It is to be hoped that the public taste is too
good to demand exhibitions of this kind—otherwise one would not
wonder at MR. SIMPson's catering for it, any more than at his sup-
**i. with carrion, if they preferred that to ordinary cold meat.
The thought of those who are dying and suffering for our ease and

King Henry. “Sweetheart,
I were unmannerly to take you out,
And not to kiss you.”
THE POPE AT TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE.
IF, during one of those persecutions which the Roman Catholics, from
the statements of their newspapers, appear to be continually suffering,
an attempt were made to fry the Pope, there is reason to expect that
his Holiness would come out of the process rather more lively, if any-
. than he was, before being subjected to it – indeed that he
wo 3 do himself no harm, even, should he step out of the frying-pan
into the fire itself.. The probability that the SUPREME PONTIFF is thus
fireproof is not derived from any similarity between his Holiness and
the Apostle, whom, Church history informs us, the pagans vainly
º to boil in oil; but from the very opposite circumstance, that
PIUs has, for some years, been existing continually in hot-water. He
has now quarrelled both with Spain and Piedmont, and with each State
on nearly the same ground. Spain has 5. him offence by refusing to
persecute anybody for his religious faith or opinions, so long as these
are not expressed by any public acts contrary to Popery; and also by
putting some limitation on the power of the priesthood to add to their
number, and create a swarm of “idle, useless, miserable clergymen,” to
uote the words of a memorandum of remonstrance with the Holy
ATHER issued by the Spanish Government. But, what no doubt is
much more vexatious to the paternal heart of his Holiness, the Govern-
ment of Spain has dared to attempt also to limit, in some moderate
degree, the power of the Church to retain prºperty. They might as
well have questioned the “Immaculate Conception.” Accordingly the
Pope threatens to retain the sins of the Spaniards; and, shaking what
he calls the keys of St. Peter at their heads, menaces them with ex-
communication. , He has pursued the same course with Piedmont;
where unserviceable convents have been abolished, and a stop thus put
to the rank luxuriance, of monkshood. Nay, a misunderstanding has
even arisen between the Papal Sovereign and his dear friend KING
BoMBA. Therefore, our lord the Pope may safely be said to be situated
in water of a very high temperature. As yet, certainly, he is not cooked,
though many expect that he will be in some little time, and DR. CUM.
MINg will perhaps inform the curious how long he will take to be done.

THE OPPOSITE PARTIES IN ST. GEORGE'S CHAPEL.
“The banner, sword, crown, and achievements of the EMPERoR of the FRExch
were placed on #riday }. Sir Charles Young, Garter King of Arms, over the Stall of
his Imperial Majesty, which immediately faces that of the KING or PRussia, in the
Chapel Royal of St. George, Windsor."
CoNFOUND that fellow, PALMERston, I’m sure it was his spite,
To get his QUEEN to make that man—that BonAPARTE– a knight;
The banner of that parvent, a studied insult, shown .
At St. George's Chapel, Windsor, hangs right opposite my own.
They knew I shouldn’t like it, if we two met ever there;
'Twould be impossible for me NAPOLEoN's eye to bear. ... .
Dash them they knew right well that I, all blushing with disgrace,
As blush I must, could never look that new Knight in the face.
For he has acted gallantly, without deceit or trick,
All Europe, saving Russia, says that I deserve a kick, .
For shuffling like a base, mean, shabby, dirty, double king:
My name is call'd a neuter noun, which signifies a thing.
Suppose I faced my vis-à-vis—hard matter to suppose!
Of course he’d instantly turn up that great, long, ugly nose,
And that mustachio'd lip of his would curl with bitter sneer,
Importing “What has that poltroon, I wonder, to do here f
“Off, Russia's underhanded friend! off lackey of the CzAR |
Thou in that place of Honour! Hence—but leave thy i. and star:
Go, in a beer-pot pl thy face—hide thy diminish’d head—
Until to ºši. they carry thee to bed!”
Whipping up a Joke.
THE Ministers in giving to MR HAYTER achina cup, are believed to
have intimated to the honourable recipient a wish, that he might long
live to enjoy as whipper in, the luxury of whipped cream in the test;
monial then presented to him.

COOL AND COMFORTABLE THIS HOT WEATHER.
A NIGHT WITH THE NATIVES AT DRURY LAN.E.”
We have a large marrowbone to pick with the Directors of the
Opera at Drury Lane. The other evening we attended the performance
of Der Freischütz at that theatre. The overture, to be sure, was admi-
rably played. Caspar did his spiriting not gently indeed, but, we will
confess, extremely well, dramatically and ºil, Agatha, or Agnes,
sang characteristically in the character of an angelic kind of girl. "We
never saw or heard a better Rodolpho, alias Mar, nor so good an Anne.
As to Zamiel, he played the deuce with a fine appreciation of the part.
Killian, Kuno, and the Hermit, all of them, behaved very well to
WEBER, and Prince Ottocar acted with almost as much propriety as
that which distinguishes PRINCE ALBERT. The Owl was . in
the Incantation scene, which the audience wanted to encore. But to
all of these personages the fashionably constituted mind will discern
one insuperable objection. Who was Caspar * MR. HAMILTON BRA-
HAM. Rodolphof MR. ARTHUR Locksiley. Ottocar? MR. GLAN-
ville. Kuno MR. Hodges. Killian * MR. Charles WEST.
4amieſ: MR. Costello...Agnes? Miss (not MDLI.E.) LANZA. Anne?
Miss DYER. The Hermit's name was omitted in the playbill—it was
probably Johnson.
This brings us to our marrow-bone. All these ladies and gentlemen
were plain Misters and Misses. There was not one Herr, Monsieur,
Signor, Madame, or Mademoiselle in the whole cast. It is very true
that the Chorus sang so well that it might have passed for German, and
that the Conductor would have been taken to be a modern Roman, if
instead of preserving the final y of his name he had denominated
himself SIGNOR TULLI. But the marrow-bone remains. The artists
above-named were so many examples of talent considerable indeed,
but merely native. We cannot say that the Owl and Supernumerary
Imps did not come from La Scala, or the Dresden or the Berlin Opera—
they hooted and danced well enough to warrant the pretence that they
did, but that was not alleged. The Opera was performed, too, after the
German manner; the whole of WEBER's music retained, and the con-
densation done by cutting down SNooks's dialogue.
Justice compels us to add, that the Drury Lane Operatic Company,
conscious of the serious want of foreign names and a corresponding
accent, appreciate their own abilities accordingly, so that their prices
for admission are expressed by low figures, and anybody who simply
wants to hear good music can get that article very cheap at their
establishment.
TAXATION AND TORTURE.
On Tuesday morning last, while MR. Timothy Brown, coal mer-
chant, was at breakfast with MRs. BRowN and his young family, at their
suburban residence, the Collector of the district, MR. Screw DRIVER,
called and demanded two quarters’ water-rates. MR. BRown went out
to him, and represented that the second quarter was due that day only,
but that the former one should be paid in a day or two, but money was
rather short with him, in consequence of the War, and so many persons
having left town without paying their bills. MR. DRIVER beckoned to
two men on the other side of the way, who came over, entered, and
closed the door. The party, without saying anything, conducted the
astonished MR. BRown down-stairs to the kitchen, out of which they
|turned the indignant servant. MR. DRIVER then said, “I must have
this money. The Company order me to get it.” MR. BRowN repeated
what he had said, and added that he had only, as it happened, a few
shillings in the house... “The Company must have it,” was the Col.
lector's answer. He then made a sign to his assistants, MR. BRowN.
was thrown º: the floor, his slippers removed, and a number of
blows were inflicted with a stick upon the soles of his feet. The
sufferer implored for mercy, but the only answer was, “the money.”
MR. B.Rown persisting in declaring that he had it not, he was dragged
to the fire, and hot water from the kettle was poured over his feet, the
Collector still repeating at intervals, “the money.” MR. B.Rown's
cries now brought down his wife, to whom the Collector explained,
with perfect civility, that he was only torturing her husband to get the
Company’s money, and then proceeded to heat a shovel red hot, with a
view to the infliction of further sufferings. Brown’s frantic
appeal for a brief delay was unheeded until she tore off her necklace
and ear-rings, and shewed that she was going to procure the money,
which she did by pawning her ornaments. The Collector gave her a
|receipt, regretting any inconvenience he might have occasioned, and
| departed, and we understand that this mode of collecting for the Com-
pany is found to work very well, and will be generally adopted.
[Mr. Punch utterly discredits the whole of the above report. It is
evidently the production of some penny-a-liner, who forgot that England
was not India, and that practices which MR, VERNoN SMITH admitted
to be the regular means of collecting “the Company’s” revenue in the
latter country, would not be tolerated here. To torture HER MAJESTY's
subjects with white faces and black clothes is one thing, to torture her
subjects with black faces and white clothes another, and the stupid
scribe who invented this ridiculous story clearly does not know the
difference.]
WONDERS OF THE WICTORIAN AGE.
OUR gracious QUEEN-long may she fill her throne,—
Has been to see Louis NApoléon.
The MAJESTY of ENGLAND-bless her heart!—
Has cut her mutton with a Bon APARTE;
And Cousin Germans have survived the view
Of ALBERT taking luncheon at St. Cloud.
In our young days we little thought to see
Such legs stretched under such mahogany;
That British Royalty would ever share
At a French Palace, French Imperial fare:
Nor eat—as we should have believed at school-
The croaking tenant of the marshy pool.
At the Trois Frères we had not feasted then,
As we have since, and hope to do again.
This great event of course could not take place
Without fit prodigies for such a case;
The brazen pig-tail of KING GeoRGE THE THIRD
Thrice with a horizontal motion stirr'd,
Then rose on end, and stood so all day long,
Amid the cheers of an admiring throng.
In every lawyer's office ELDoN shed
From plaster nose three heavy drops of red.
Each §. too, of PITT turn'd up the point
Of its proboscis—was that out of joint?
Whilst Charles JAMEs Fox's grinn'd from ear to ear,
And PEEL's emitted frequent cries of “Hear!”
Finis Coronet.
LoRD CAMPBELL boasted in the House of Lords, on the last night of
the session, that he had been a soldier in his time, and said he believed
that he could even now manage a Minié rifle. It is not improbable,
considering how well “plain John ” has succeeded in an aim requiring
some skill—that of lodging certain balls on the top of his own head.
HAWKS ABROAD.
A PROVINCIAL society has been formed with a laudable object, that
of counteracting the sale, by hawkers, of objectionable books. It has,
however, a curious title, being called the Book-Hawking Society. To
an association with such a name, the first purchases that would occur
would, we suppose, be the FALCON Family, with the productions of
|FAlconer's Mews, Hood's, BELL’s, and JEsse’s.
Look Again.
THE Irish papers, which publish MB. GAvAN DUFFY's hope, that
LIPRANDI and Todleben may gain victories over the Allies, also com-
plain that no allusion is made to Ireland in the Queen's Prorogation
Speech. In terms, perhaps, there is none; but is there not a con-
gratulation to Parliament on the passing the Criminal Justice Act?

And reluctantly
lends his ear.

Mayor and Al-
dermen went
swanhopping on
the Thames.
The Swell loseth

The Alderman
telleth how the
voyage pro-
ceeded.
How the party

How the party

How, being re-
plete, they re-
buked the discon-
tent of complain-
ing persons,
And the exagge-
rations of distress
by the press.
PART I.
It is an Ancient Alderman,
And he stoppeth one of three;
“By thy gouty hand and ruby nose,
ow wherefore stopp'st thou me?
The Adelphi doors have open'd long,
And I would save my tin;
Mº.; 's lost at seven o’clock,
ermit me to go in.”
He holds him with his gouty hand
“There is the Thames,” quoth he; -
“Bother the Thames,” the other cried’;
“Jump in, and let me be.”
He holds him by the glitterin d,
The Stunning Swell stood #ff-
And listens in most sulky style;
The Alderman hath his will.
The Stunning Swell against a lamp
Leant, as if bored to death,
And thus gasp'd on that Alderman,
With brevity of breath.
“The MAyor appear'd, the barge was steer'd,
Merrily we | drop, -
The Aldermen, in City Barge,
Along on our Swan-Hop.
“At the Blackfriars we did embark,
Where gapes the mighty sewer.”
The Stunning Swell he stamp'd his foot,
For he heard the overture.
MELLON hath mounted on his stool,
The desk he tappeth thrice—
Four Roberts now the Swell must pay,
Or wait for the half-price.
“We pull’d—at least the rowers did—
Bang through the Bridges Three,
And Lambeth Reach, and Chelsea Reach,
We pass'd full merrily.
“And then the hour of lunch was come,
Our appetites wax’d strong,
We eat and drank, and drank and eat;
The Chaplain sang a song.
“We drank and eat, we eat and drank,
Till full was every sinner;
And then we thought we'd go on deck,
While STAPLEs laid the dinner.
“We lean'd along the barge's seats,
Or o'er the bulwarks bent;
We said it was a jolly world,
And folks †† be content.
“We said it was a jolly world,
And everybody stated
That what we read of want and wrong
Was much exaggerated.
But suddenly
smelt as it were
a Smell.
Disgust of the
Chief Magistrate
and Conservator
of the River
Thames.
The Smell in-
creases,
To their discom-
fiture,
And still increas-
ing, it is dis-
covered to arise
from the stream
they ought to
have conserved.
Revolting details.
More revolting
details.
A drowning cat
garlanded with
drowned kittens
is seen.
The Alderman
| shoots the cat.
| The crew escape
into pure air and
pure water.
“That on the whole we really thought
Things went uncommon well—
When the Remembrancer bawl’d out,
‘GoG ! what a hawful Smell.”
“The MAYor he started to his feet,
Out of his lordly doze,
And ramm'd his scented handkerchief—
Close up unto his nose.
“And as the Smell came foully round,
We gasp'd and spit, and swore;
Such an abominable stench
We’d never smelt before.
“And after comments fierce and fast
On that unsavoury theme,
For reasons which I need not name,
Each turn'd him to the stream.
“When fouler, fouler rose the smell,
And then we did diskiver
The source of all that awful stench,
Dear GoG, it was the River!
“The river it was yellow mud,
With putrid colours varied,
And j, kind of filthy thing
Upon the tide was carried.
“Dead dogs rotund, and garbage vile,
And slime, and scum, and º
Clung round as in a foetid lake,
And oozed, and stank, and stuck.
“And in the mess a drowning Cat
Mid seven drown'd kittens sprawl’d,
And her great eyes stared wildly out,
And piteously she squall’d.
“There was a blunderbuss on board—”
“Old Cock, what are you at—
Are you not well?” “O gentle Swell,

PART II.
“We pull’d—at least the rowers did,
How long I cannot say,
But up to Richmond's pleasant banks
At length we made our way.
“There ran the river pure and bright,
Without a speck or stain;
So once it ran at Westminster,
And so might run again.

THE CRICKET ON THE MORMON'S
HEARTH.
WE learn from the New York Herald that the
crickets and grasshoppers are devouring up, and
serve them right, the Mormons of Utah. That
grasshoppers will devour men, nay, whole families
alive, is a fact not to be denied by any one
who will consider the doings of the GREshAM
grasshopper at the Stock Exchange. How many
a broker has that grasshopper nibbled to bits,
singing the while, and Bow bells ringing music
to the feast ! In like manner, the Mormons were
chewed up in the Illinois in 1846, devoured
—say the accounts—“by the crickets; great
| goggle-eyed, crook-legged, bottle-bodied mon-
sters.” They are more than a match for the
oriental white ant, that in a night will leave the
bones of an elephant as clean as a domino. Most
appalling are the accounts of the ravages of these
monster crickets on the hearths of the Mormons.
Cradles, with half-a-dozen babies in them, at
night, are found empty in the morning. And a
doting and incomparable husband—the spouse of
fourteen wives at dewy eye-finds himself seven
times a widower at sunrise. It is said, and we
give the fact as awarning to all about to emigrate
to marry at the Salt Lake, that the crickets have
a preference for wives; carrying half-a-dozen off
from under one roof, and º, them to a
music of their own, and that may be set to the
old words of “Plenty more where they come
from.”

St. BASTINApo.—THE government, of Rome
has, in imitation of Naples, introduced the
see why it should not be canonised; for what,
in the Calendar, is one stick more?
TWO KINGS AND TWO COUNTRIES.
FoEs in arms, when swords were swaying in the push of battle:
Foes in arts, when pens were weighing claims with critic prattle:
Foes in trade, at every haven, Jack 'gainst Tricolor;
Foes in habits, in the leaven of their lives, all o'er:
France and England, foes no longer, hand in hand are clasping:
For their ancient feud the stronger be that tardy grasping !
Bells from out a hundred steeples clash their gladsome greeting,
While the chiefs of two great peoples #. in friendly meeting.
Thick within my brain are clustering dim historic ſancies
Of our HENRY, bluff and blustering, kissing liquorish FRANcis;
While the Cardinal, prime mover of those º royal,
By ANNE BoLEYN's broad-back'd lover rears his brow disloyal.
What are our shows for the million to that gorgeous scene,
In the carved and gilt pavilion, on the plain of Guisnes?
Plate, and cloth of gold and arras, -ſountains running wine—
Gems that hungry eyes embarrass with their changing shine;
While, amid those blazing splendours—cynosures of all–
Move the Kings, with their defenders, proper men and tall.
BRANDoN, DoRSET, RATCLIFFE, NEVILLE, CAPEI, and CAREw,
England's champions in the revel, and the tilt-yard too;
St. Pol, MontmorENCY, BIRoN, FLEURANGEs, and CoMMINEs,
Lusty sires, in silk or iron brave alike of mien.
Meteor-like in trailing scarlets Wolsey rides along,
While Lords, proud to serve as varlets, at his stirrup throng.
In old time, ’twas in such journeys, with their pomp and pride,
Masques and mummings, jousts and tourneys, kings, not countries vied.
In the persons of their princes nations then were known ;
What of light that time evinces shines from round the throne.
Of the people, of their willing, ". suffering—nought !
Good for taxing, they, or killing, while kings spent or fought.
Times are changed. Nor mask nor tourney gilds our sober days;
Kings, like common folks, must journey by the iron ways.
For our QUEEN, of outward honour make we small ado;
Yet a splendour waits upon her bluff HAL never knew.
With no shows nor pageants pressing round her thcugh she move.
She has gems—a people's blessing; she has guards—their love.
In their Sovereigns’ courteous meeting France and England share,
The nations are repeating vows the monarchs swear.
THE FIRST SINGER GOING—BUT NOT GONE.
GRISI gave us the gratification of singing during the past season at
the Italian Opera, because happily her villa at Florence was not com-
pletely ready for her—the Glazier having omitted to glaze the windows,
or the Painter having forgotten to paint the doors. Happily for the
Parisians the same neglect still prevails among the tradesmen of the
Prima donna, for she is announced to sing in Paris during the ensuing
winter, in consequence, no doubt, of the Upholsterer having failed to
put up the curtains according to contract, and having thus left her free
to appear before the curtain again. We dare say the tradesmen of
GRISI will know how to accommodate their future movements to the
taste of the public; and if the Queen of Song is required next year at
Covent Garden, nothing will be easier than for the Ironmonger to
forget to send home the scraper, or the Bell-hanger to omit to hang the
street-door bell.
Qf course it would be unreasonable to expect a public favourite to
retire until everything is made perfectly comfortable for her reception;
and it is even possible that if she should have finally taken leave, and
the pipe of the cistern should burst, or the rain should come in at a
loose slate in the roof, she might be induced to reappear for a few
nights during the completion of the necessary repairs. The only thing
to be apprehended is the possibility that the lady herself may get a little
damaged in her vocal machinery, and that before her villa is in every
respect ready for her, the public may begin to feel that it is time to say
Farewell! The time has not yet approached, but we recommend the
still attractive favourite to keep her tradesmen up to the mark, if she
wishes to have her villa in perfect order for her reception, when it is
really time for her to take possession.
Official Incubation.
MR. MonsELL has confessed that Government has had MR. BASHLEY |
BRITTEN's improved shells, nine months under consideration. The
H. might be that the shells were empty, since Government
as been sitting on them so long without hatching anything, if we were
not satisfied of the fulness of the shells, and equally convinced of the
Government's emptiness.
THE ADIEUX OF DUFFY.
MR. DUFFY has taken, farewell of Ireland; and proposes to go to
Australia, there like the hunted ostrich, to hide his head in the Bush:

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BARNUM FOR PRESIDENT.
(From the New York Freeman.)
T is with no ordinary
pleasure that we an-
nounce a new candi-
date for the Presiden-
tial chair of this great
and enlightened Re-
ublic; and we shall
e much surprised if
the news, that the
individual in question
is about to tender
himself for this, the
most honourable office
in creation, does not
at once cause the
heart of every true
= American to leap with
rapture, while tyrants
upon the thrones of
the old world experience the shudder which foretells impending deso-
lation. The HonourABLE TAYLoR PHINIAs BARNUM, as will be seen
in another part of our columns, addresses the people of America, and
asks their suffrages at the ensuing election for President.
What the honourable candidate has urged in his own manly, masterly,
ay, and majestic appeal, we cannot hope to strengthen by our
advocacy. e has there shown with irrefragable force, why he is at
this moment the fittest man of all our glorious millions to take the
conduct of the State. His one irresistible and logical argument must
carry conviction to every bosom., “An American for the Amerieans,”
he not less boldly than truthfully says, is a maxim eternal as the
undying stars; but his corollary is scarcely less triumphant, namely,
“the most American of Americans is the man for America”. To that
title the honourable candidate appears to us fully to make out his claim;
and because we believe him to be the complete and noble representative
of all that is great and original in the character of our nation, we
humbly, but strenuously, proffer him a support which gold would vainly
seek to buy.
The honourable candidate has enunciated his views in words of
singular force, and it will be a proud, day for the Republic, when her
state papers are composed in a style which combines the lucidity with the
solidity of the diamond. As well might you seek to displace a stone
from a wall with the aid of your finger as to disturb his collocation of
phrases. He says:—“I own, not with shame, but with pride, that my
character is truly American. I glory in the thought that my nature
reflects that of the millions to whom I now *... I admit that I
have the true American admiration for all that I have myself achieved,
and the true American disbelief in the achievements of others. So
thinks the nation of herself and of her contemporaries, and I adore her
for that noble pride. I own that the cold petty dogmas of antiquity,
on what it arrogantly calls truth and justice, have as little echo in my
bosom as in that of this glorious Republic. A nation with a mission
like ours takes its creed from no less worthy source than its own
mighty intellectual organisation...I add too, and add proudly, that it is
not for a freeman to chain himself to what pedants call truth, but by
the inspiration of anticipatory prophecy, to state facts as he would have
them, and then, by his dominant might, to mould them into what he
has described them." Tºm an American, and I dauntlessly say, that he
best represents America who is bound by no tyrannic fetter, but who
ds his knee alone at the shrine of progress and enlightenment.”
. To the inherent nobility of this declaration, which has been made
in feebler words by many of our leading statesmen, who have, not always
ineffectually, followed out its principle, we can add nothing. But as the
yirulent pens of the hirelings of tyrants, will doubtless be let loose, both
in Europe and here, upon the honourable candidate, let us forestall
some of their venom. It will be scoffingly said, that MR. BARNUM has
been a showman. He has-nay, he is one at this hour, and millions of
dollars attest to his success. this a reproach in a land of liberty
and equality? From the haughty Ten Thousand, the miserable carica-
tures of English and French aristocrats, we may expect the taunt—we
should blush to think that a true American would think less of his
President because he had made his fortune by exhibiting the wondrous
creations of Providence. No, we will not answer this. But it will be
urged that he has lowered his dignity as a man by attending a wretched
dwarf from Court to Court in the Old World, and accepting the
gold and jewels of “patrons.” Patrons ! The THUMB tour was the
noblest work ever done by an American freeman. It was a death-blow
at kings, and king-ships. BARNUM has solemnly declared, upon the
unstained honour of an American citizen, that his only object in taking
the unhappy monstrosity to Europe was to humble crowned heads by
exposing their folly and weakness, and to show them to the New
World, slavering over a loathsome dwarf, and enriching him with a
| colossal fortune, while men of genius were tºº neglected in their
garrets. Such was the THUMB tour, and the deed alone entitles
ARNUM to claim the suffrages of republicans. -
|. We fearlessly and fervently echo that demand. Not for his efforts
to honour the sacred name of WASHINGTON, by honouring even the
aged negress on whose dusky bosom the liberator's infantine form had
lain,_not for his endeavour to confer upon the agriculturists of our
colder provinces the invaluable boon of an animal that could contend
with the icy wind—we allude to his introduction of the Woolly Horse
—not for his graceful tribute to the reproductive talent of the Republic,
when he gathered around him the childish loveliness of our States, and
rewarded the most exquisite of the baby forms with a prize the sickly
seedlings of royalty might envy—not for the yet more chivalrous
courtesy with which at this moment he proffers the golden apple to the
female beauty of the nation, but, with a delicacy unknown to regal
courts, he covers that beauty with the veil of the daguerreotype-not
for all this, but because TAYLoR PHINIAs BARNUM is emphatically an
| American, a type and a symbol of the glorious Republic, do we echo
the national cry—“BARNUM For PRESIDENT | *
A SPIRITUAL WEEKLY PAPER.
THE Spiritual Telegraph is a New York Paper, worth, it would seem,
many a rap. In South Nº." however, Vermont State, there are
weekly papers” edited and got up wholly by spiritual management'
We are told that a MR, and MRs. MERRILL of that, enlightened place
have, like JEPHTHA, a daughter—that is, a medium daughter.
“They have an interesting medium in the person of their own daughter, fifteen
years old, through whom volumes have been written."
Written, doubtless, on tallest foolscap, and bound in thickest calf.
But this is nothing.
“They receive ‘weekly papers printed in imitation of type, and edited by angels;”
and they have “sheets written by invisible hands in red and black ink,’ though they
have “no red ink in the house, and never had any. They have seen the Spirit-hand
which wrote these, seen Spirit-lights, and had many other demonstrations of Spiritual
presence.”
That papers should be edited by angels proves that the printer's devil
has, at least in Vermont State, been altogether superseded. Now, by
what means do these angels write * With sunbeams? or with quills,
plucked and nibbed from their own wings? that may, in some measure,
account for the redness of the ink. As for the “Spirit-hand,” we can
easily imagine what sort of hand this must be, Mr. Punch having, in his
varied experience, often seen the sort of hand, of exactly the same
crooked pattern, held up in the dock of the Old Bailey. Mr. Punch
can, in his own person, almost believe in the possibility of an angel of
an editor; but how about an angel of a penny-a-liner? Who is to

unpaid nursing ” is to be carried out. Mr. Punch will add no word of
his to the beauty of the design; for words are not wanted. He will
merely, as in blithe duty bound, observe, that those who think grate-
fully and lovingly of the notion of the NIGHTINGALE's Nest will, without
loss of time, duly deposit their golden eggs at CouTTs's. When golden

MR. DISRAELI, in the course of rather a severe article in the Press,

has resolved to show the country that he thinks the Comic History
England the best extant.” This handsome admission that, after a

does credit to the candour of a political opponent; and Mr. Punch is gla
to see that even amid the asperities of controversy, the Ex-CEANceſſion

might have done, by accusing the PREMIER of holding a reverse opinion.

BOMBARDMENT OF SWEABORG.
(From the Invulnerable Russe.)
A suppleMENT to the above journal contains the following despatches
from the commander of Sweaborg. They are dated 29th of July
(otherwise August 10).
The enemy’s fleet, consisting of 150 ships of the line, 120 mortar-
hoats, and 230 gunboats, anchored at 9 and 11 A.M., and opened fire.
They fired from 500 to 520 shots a minute, but with no effect.
2:40 after midnight.—The fire of the enemy has become so heavy that
three mortar-boats have been shattered to pieces by the recoil, the crew
of which were picked up by the boats of the ships of the line. The
| enemy has alſº lost 10,000 shells.
5:55 A.M.–A, shell has fallen upon a spirit shop, and the conflagration
of twenty hogsheads of raki is the consequence. Nothing can exceed
the enthusiasm of our brave soldiery, who burn for the hour of
vengeance.
$15 A.M.–A rocket has just entered a chemist's, and an explosion
followed. The chemist's unfortunately adjoining an oil and pickle shop,
the flames have spread. The conduct of our troops is excellent.
1025 A.M.–A shell has burst in a barrel of tar, in close proximity to
a powder magazine. The impending destruction was stayed by the
heroic BoMBADIER WAGhisownchinoFF, who flung himself into the
burning mass, and, at the cost of his life, and with incredible coolness,
extinguished it. His ashes have been reserved, and, duly enshrined in
an urn of platina, will be dedicated to St. ANDREw.
12:30 P.M.–The enemy has brought up all his boats, but, thanks be
to St. Nicholas, has done nothing of consequence.
1 P.M.–A lucifer match manufactory caught fire, but the flames have
been extinguished by a milkmaid (name not given).
2 P.M.–The enemy have withdrawn all their ships, mortar-boats, and
gun-boats that have escaped.
All our batteries are consolidated in their foundations by the thunder
of the enemy.
Casualties.—One Cossack missing.
SALARY FOR A SEHARP YOUNG MAN.
SHARP young men of business appear in a commercial sense to be
t. Here is an advertisement from the Times, whence it would seem
that in the labour market they are quoted at a very low figure:—
WAN.P. a sharp YOUNG MAN, thoroughly acquainted with the
examination floor, Custom House, and Dock Business. Salary about £30 per
annum. Address full particulars to A., 146, Leadenhall Street.
Perhaps the hours during which it is proposed to work the sharp
young man daily at £30 a-year are few in number: or perhaps that
moderate salary is to be a superaddition to board and lodging, with
treatment as one of an uncommonly happy family. It is rather un-
reasonable to expect the services of a sharp young man on terms not
exceeding those which would be expected by an able-bodied labourer;
and the sharp young man who would accept them would probably be
discovered by his employer to be, in regard to any property he might
be intrusted with, considerably more sharp than honest.
The Rule with many Government Places.
THE height of the place is not always in proportion to the merit that
fills it. You frequently see a weak person in a high place, and wonder
to yourself how he got there. But do not be discontented—at a dinner-
table is not the highest seat invariably occupied by the most childish?
As SURE AS A GUN.
THERE used to be a doubt as to the value of guns when brought into
operation against walls, but recent events at Sweaborg have proved that
. ºul mortar is more than a match for any quantity of Russian
Ticks.
BosNETs AND BIRTHs—The present style of Bonnet is certainly not
of a Malthusian character, for since they came into use there have been
more hairs-apparent than ever.

The landing of the luggage from the steamboat
is a great military operation, for not a sac de

beware of , entering too speedily into, friendly

missions from themselves, and taking the title
of Commissioner, who if he is an Englishman,
will attach themselves to him and follow him
wherever he goes. If he knows what to do, they
will tell him, in indifferent English, what he is
doing, and when he has done it they will touch
their hats and ask to be paid. If he does not
know what to do, or where to go, they will walk
about with him until they have got the keys of

moment the “master of the situation,” the tra-

On arrival in a Continental city, be it Paris
or Brussels, or any other, you will naturally go
to see everything that is to be seen. On these
occasions avoid taking a stick for your companion,
for a stick is always disagreeable, most especially
when you have to pay a couple of sous for
leaving it at the door. It has been said that a
horse can eat his own head off, but this operation
is more rapidly performed by a gold mounted
cane, which eats off its head in less than a week,
if a penny is paid every time it is left in a
porter's hands.
AN ENTIRELY NEW HOSPITAL.
THE proposed NIGHTINGALE testimonial announced in the Times—a
hospital served by unpaid nurses under her direction—is a tribute, the
idea of which we regard with feelings far different from those with
which we contemplate the gold salver voted to the arch-rogue of a rail.
way company, or the tea-service and slippers presented to the clerical
humbug. Indeed, we are rather ashamed at having named such very
dissimilar things in the same sentence. If the public gives Miss
NIGHTINGALE a hospital, it will acknowledge the good she has done by
giving her more of it to do. Virtue, in this case, will be its own
reward, but the case will be, that one of extremely rare occurrence,
wherein the meritorious party can enjoy the recompense. The sufficient
military hospital, also advocated by the leading journal, is an institution
of which not only is the establishment desirable, but the want is in-
famous. It may, therefore, be feared that the suggestion for the
foundation of such a hospital will not be adopted by any Ministry. But
there is a description of infirmary whereof the notion might very possibly
find favour with a British Cabinet. Many of our enlightened aristocracy,
among them, we believe, LoRD Robert GRosvenor, support a place
of provision for the treatment of disease by doses of medicine imper-
çeptibly larger than the ultimate particles of matter. Of course, these
fashionable philosophers and wise ladies have studied anatomy, phy-
siology, and pathology, and have thence been enabled to discern that
HUNTER and ABERNETHY were two humbugs, and that HAHNEMANN
was not one, for clearly he was one, if they were not two.
A homoeopathic hospital is not, however, what we are now alluding to,
although the ºW. might be likely enough to entertain the
proposal of that. e mean a hospital of an entirely novel character,
albeit conducted on medical principles, which have long been recog:
nised officially. This is to be a hospital without physicians, surgeons,
or an #."; One medical officer is to serve for all three. That
individual shall be the Patent Medicine Wendor. He shall supply the
atients, with whatever remedies they may choose to ...; they
aying to prescribe for their own cases. To enable them to manage
this not very difficult matter with perfect ease, let them be furnished
with plenty of advertisements of various and rival pills, ointments,
mixtures, balsams, elixirs, tinctures, &c. &c., including testimonials
and directions for use.
As Government not only permits the sale of
quack medicines, but encourages it by sealing them with the stamp of
its approbation, it of course thinks the self-prescription of specifics a
form of medical treatment proper for the public at large, and must
therefore approve of a hospital in which the indigent sick may relieve
themselves of their maladies by the same practice.
PEACE UPON CRUTCHES.
THERE is a very pretty story of the War that we hope foreshadows
the conditions of a peace. On the attack of the 18th on the Malakhoff
CAPTAIN M., a Frenchman, and CAPTAIN S., a Russian, meet and
exchange the “usual compliments” with sabres. Both are hurt; and
the Frenchman is made prisoner. Both are sent to Odessa: again
both meet. The Frenchman is cured of his wounds, is hale and strong;
but the Russian is still upon crutches. However, the old combatants
recognise each other; embrace; and become such friends that, when
they part, they separate with weeping eyes!
What a pity that men do not embrace before fighting, that no fighting
may come of it! Is it not so, MR. GLADSTONE; is it not so, Mr.
BRIGHT: We know that both of you will say “ay,” and so says
Punch; but since this cannot be; since the CZAR, strong upon the
wrong side, will cross his sabres, let us hope that, with the Russian
CAPTAIN S., he may have the worst of it. e can only embrace Russia
with safety, when we embrace her upon crutches.
Austria Slandered.
SoME evil disposed foreign journals have stated that Austria had
remonstrated with KING BoMBA on the wholesome punishments
introduced, under royal patronage, into Naples and the Two Sicilies.
There is no truth whatever in the malignant report. “Spare the rod
and º the child,”, says high authority. “Spare the stick and
spoil the subject,” thinks Austria. It is understood that KING BoMBA
. ºntinue to use the stick until compelled on his own account “to
cut it.’

as the givers and takers of these salutes may otherwise be a matter of
dispute, Mr. Punch proposes this easy mode of compromise. On the
base of the monument there will, of course, be four medallions. Let
one of these medallions show how the EMPERoR saluted the QUEEN on

RARE FUN AT RYDE.
ONE of the most amusing as well as intellectual of our old English
sports and pastimes, is a competition consisting in the pursuit of an
animal greased as to the tail, and in the endeavour to catch and holdit by
that appendage. Another is the rivalry of climbing, or rather attempting
to climb, a pole similarly lubricated, on the top of which is placed a
similar animal. That animal is the prize of . or prehensile
prowess; amusement results chiefly from unsuccessful exertion; the
iſ competitors are clowns in general: and the animal is always a pig.
The refined mind will admit that this diversion beats cockfighting by
much, if it is not very superior to chess or billiards. To a more robust
staste, if not to a stronger intellect, it may appear insufficiently exciting,
E and capable of improvement in that respect.
Something has been done
towards filling the room for that improvement; as witness the following
=|copy of a handbill published at Ryde, in the Isle of Wight:—

THE ROYAL SALUTES AT BOULOGNE.
MR. Punch very much regrets that, circumstances over which he of
course had no control—(whoever has *)—kept him from the shores of
Boulogne on the arrival of QUEEN Victoria; otherwise there would
not have been left for future historians, a great question—to be hence-
forth known as the Great Kiss Question—never, perhaps, to be satis-
factorily settled. The unsatisfactory report of that kiss will descend,
echoing through generations. We are told by the Morning Post, that
ought to know something about a question of “cheek,” that when the
royal yacht was brought to, a flying bridge was extended to her from
the shore. -
“But no sooner had the QUEEN put her foot on it and left the deck, than, as on her
first touching the soil of France, the EMPERon, who had previously dismounted, came
forward, took HER MAJESTY by the hand, and saluted her on both cheeks—a salutation
ry g royal per ges on such : --- **
The English present, not aware of the royal etiquette, were at first
taken, says JENKINs, by surprise. However, they soon recovered
themselves, and corroborated the salute on both cheeks “with three very
hearty cheers.” Now, history would be content with this ; but how is
it possible, when—on the testimony of the Morning Chronicle—the
cheeks are changed? The Chronicle, with historic gravity avers that—
“His Imperial Majesty immediately stepped on board, and, having bowed, kissed
the hand of the QUEEN. HER MAJESTY then kissed the Empehon on both his cheeks.’,
Will this question ever he cleared up We fear not. It is hardly
to be expected that HER MAJESTY will “write to the Times,” denying
the statement of the Chronicle; whilst, on the other hand, it would be
a shocking want of gallantry in Louis NAPOLEON to do so, he being
most delighted to enjoy the benefit of even a doubt. However,
Mr. Punch thinks he espies a way by which the difficulty may be
managed.
Boulogne has already one column, a column commemorative of the
landing (that did not take place) of NAPOLEoN in England; let there be
another Boulogne column that, to all future generations, shall perpe-
tuate the pacific landing of Victoria in France. The EMPERoR
would have come wielding thunderbolts, the QUEEN really lands,
offering the rose of Albion to be bound up with the violets of Gaul.
Very different memories will be awakened by the two columns.
“Colonels, forward!”, writes NEY in his Account of his Division for
the Invasion of Great Britain-and “in ten minutes and a half, twenty-

G. BUTLER, Printer, “Observer”. Office, Colonnade, Lind Street, Ryde.
The horizontal arrangement of the greased pole and the pig over the
water is a great improvement upon, the perpendicular, on terrá Jizº.
The fun of failure is much enhanced by the consequent ducking; besides.
which the sport has the interest of danger to the competitors. If one
of them, in falling, knocked his head against the pole, he would perhaps.
be stunned, and then he would not only tumble into the sea, but would
never rise out of it. However, some attendant emissary of the Humane
Society might succeed in spoiling this consummation of the sport; and
geese swim; therefore, instead of suspending the pole over the sea
another time, it would be advisable to set it over a tank of boiling.
water. A close plantation of spikes would answer the same purpose at
less expense.
But what public-spirited party is it that has been thus treating, or
offering to treat, the Isle of Wight people to games? Whoever that
party may be, the Ryde Pier proprietors ought to be particularly
obliged thereto: for no doubt the attraction held out by the pig and
the “Pole Dance” to the intelligence of the Island was calculated
largely to augment the receipts at the Toll House alluded to in the
| above-quoted announcement.

A PARISIAN SOLEMNITY.
OUR Parisian contemporaries have been full
of glowing descriptions of what they termed the
“solemnity” which took place at the Grand
Qpera on the occasion of the QUEEN’s State Visit.
The solemnity consisted of a trio from William
- Tell ; some yariations sung by CRUVELLI; an
élincelant bolero; le ſ"; cosmopolite; and, by
way of conclusion, le fameur Gode "Save the
Queen... Our vivacious neighbours have an odd
idea of a “solemnity” when they describe by
such, a term a sort of medley performance, in
which a bolero and a galop formed the principal
ingredients... We could conceive the title of
“solemnity” being given to a selection from
the Old Masters, whose Ops. present the most
ponderous specimens of abstruse counterpoint;
but to attach the notion of anything solemn to
an entertainment comprising sparkling boleros
and cosmopolitan galops is an idea we cannot
realise.
We can imagine a solemnity made up from
the labours of the old contra-pointists, but there
is a vast difference between the galop of mo-
dern date and the slow coach movements of the
ancient harmonists. With our mercurial neigh-
bours, however, everything is a solemnity, if it
has any object beyond the moment; and as such
we are willing to accept every incident connected
with the visit of the QUEEN to the FRENCH
EMPEROR.

terminus, she just left a lambent stream of light behind her to mar
her way, but that was all. Boulogne saw nothing of the royal counte-
nance-nothing of the royal smile, that, during the absence of the sun
from foggy England, ripens the royal peaches in the royal gardens.
Therefore, Boulogne resolved, on the return of the QUEEN, to embark
for faithful Albion, to have a good stare at HER MAJESTY by day-light,
moon-light, , and fire-light. To this end, the sun of sunny France
vouchsafed its brightest lustre—(it could not have been finer on the
morn of Austerlitz)—whilst the moon, with a gentle pale face, sweet and
fair as EUG#NIE's, looked mildly down; ºf yet the same moon that
shone on Agincourt! The fireworks slept like dragons in sheets of
}. ready to †. and sparkle with the first “Promethean touch.”
oulogne was so full, that many families slept with their feet out of
Hotel windows-English all; a fact easily, and withal painfully, commu-
nicated to the Gallic beholder by the clumsiness of the sleepers' shoe-
leather. One enthusiastic solicitor from Thavies' Inn could be accommo-
dated for a bed with nothing more extensive than a knife-board; but
being professionally accustomed to make much of a little, he was over-
heard to assure his friend KNAGGs (of Furnival's) that he couldn't
have slept more sweetly on a woolsack. Perhaps, indeed, he got up all
the sharper for that knife-board!
It touched the British bosom tenderly, musically,–so musically, that
the British heart-strings, vibrating to the sentiment, softly murmured
God Save the Queen—to mark the hospitable, the affectionate preparations
made to welcome the Bonne Petite Reine. She had shot through Boulogne
like a sunbeam onward to Paris; she had beheld, to the astonishment
of the dust of grandfather GeoRGE THE THIRD, the capital of his
natural enemy; she had beheld, and wondered; and was now returning,
ed and lustrous with the splendours she had gazed upon . The
glories of the Hôtel-de-Wille must still float about her—the glitter of
the thousands of bayonets, glistening in the Champ-de-Mars, must
make a halo around the royal bonnet, QUEEN VICTORIA, an excellent
little QUEEN, landed at Boulogne, and went on her rapid way to Paris.
But now she returns, glorified, sublimated by the homage, the raptures
of the past week, -and, par Dieu'ſ she is now not only une bonne petite
reine, but une reine magnifique / For, had she not gone, hand in hand
with the EMPEROR, to the coffin of Naroneos? Had not BRITANNIA,
a little remorseful about St. Helena, gazed with reverent softened eyes
at , what covered so much dust-dust, that once burned with the
quickening might of myriads! That right hand had hurled thunder-
bolts, every bolt bringing down some throne. One the thunder could
not reach, but still fºils hort, still went down into the deep that still
hissed in scorn. And now, the gentle woman who adorns that throne,
in her very gentleness embodying the calm strength of England, comes
to the .#. of the dead enemy of her land; and in his coffin—the while
the organ peals old England's anthem—buries all dead enmities. Such
an incident is, in its solemnity, the very religion of history. Painters
historical, prepare your palettes!
Punch changes paragraphs, and is again at Boulogne. At five
o'clock, a cannon boomed forth—“Here she comes!”, “She comes”—
“she comes”—bellowed another and another. “She is come,” another
bellows, with thundering satisfaction. The magnificent QUEEN has
returned to Boulogne, and Boulogne fetches a long breath !
There can be no doubt of the magic influence of Paris on the QUEEN OF
ENGLAND; yes, and on the QUEEN’s first and most dutiful subject,
PRINCE ALBERT, late of Saxe-Gotha. The Boulogne mind discerns
even in the improved bonnet of the QUEEN OF ENGLAND the blessed in-
fluence of the Paris visit. The QUEEN's brow is more ample; a tablet
enlarged to hold greater memories: the QUEEN’s eyes were blue as the
sea at its bluest,--but now, as the sea, they are deep. HER MAJESTY
has devoured so many wonders, that she has become exalted beyond
mere Britannic royalty. She has eaten and drunk of the ambrosia and
nectar of Paris, and her mien, her looks, declare the influence of the
celestial fare. So speculates and resolves the philosophic mind of
Boulogne ! -
In a few minutes, and the QUEEN is prepared to review the troops
on the Sands. The Champ-de-Mars had been honoured in Paris, why
not the Champ-de-Neptune in Boulogne? There were the #:
fellows drawn out, drawn in; and all of them very plainly understanding
their business; a truth Mr. Punch was immediately convinced of, when
he observed FIELD-MARSHAL PRINCE ALBERT give an approving nod.
The MARSHAL seemed particularly pleased with the marvellous move:
ments of the Chasseurs de Vincennes, who treat war as a practical
joke, and, would have as much fun and no more in dislodging monkeys
from a sugar plantation as in routing regiments of Russians. In fact,
to a Chasseur, a mounted Don Cossack is no more than a monkey on
pony-back-Nothing can beat the good-temper of these fellows: they
crack a skull as a good joke; and to their teeth bullets are merely
sugar-plums. If there be “dogs of war,” then are the Chasseurs war's
playful puppy-dogs! The review ended, and, it is said by some who

boast good eyes, that as the troops moved off the ground, the statue of
NAPoleoN on his own Column, bent a little forward; and his bronze
lips moved somewhat, as he vouchsafed down from his eminence, an
imperial bow. NapoleoN in the flesh had, in his time, been on that
.# : nothing could move him then: but now a scene was acting on
Boulogne Sands, that in its wondrous strangeness moved and melted
even bronze. To think that French regiments should, on a French
shore, pass in review before a Queen OF ENGLAND, the while English
i. calm in the magnificence of their might, should lie lazily
in the offing ! -
The QUEEN OF ENGLAND went to dinner, and all the fireworks, from
smallest, most spluttering squib, to tallest, and most starry rocket,
must have felt the warmth of impatience that still pervaded Boulogne,
growing the warmer as the hour came on. At length, God Save the
Queen was breathed through regimental brass! (Again, a very sharp
eye-witness averred to Mr. Punch that he saw the bronze NAPOLEON
just lift his bronze chapeau!) The QUEEN descended; and, at the same
time, the QUEEN’s º the Pictoria and Albert, like the Sea Serpent
illuminated—with fiery speed, dashed to the harbour to receive her mis-
tress. The thing seemed alive, and of its instinct seemed to know its duty.
Can MR. PUNCH write fireworks? Can he dip his pen in pyrotechnic
ink? Why, perhaps not. Butlet the reader consider the page before
him. Let him imagine every letter—black and small, and thronging-
suddenly touched into a firework of some sort—this P a marvellous
rocket, showering stars; this U a Bengal light; this N–this c-this H

reader obligingly think this, and so thinking, º the fireworks by
multiplication that shall reach, to the skies, and he may, perhaps,
imagine somewhat of the splendours that burned about QUEEN Vic-
ToRIA as she took her way on board. Out blazed a #. growing
to the heavens,—a bouquet of red, white, and blue fire-flowers—roses
red and white, and violets of azure—as the yacht, its quarter all a
flame, like burning arrow, shot along the sea! -
And then—and then—the guns of the English ships gave mouth; as
it seemed to Mr. Punch's ears—with a gruff affectionateness, welcoming
their mistress, the Royal Lady of the Lions, back again to them i:sili -
they roared, and still deeper and deeper, as though their satisfaction
deepened as their own QUEEN came nearer and nearer; and she was
once again among them -
And in such affectionate, such loyal guardianship—with the hopes of

we WICTORIA.
Two Mermaids rose in the offing. One sang God save the Queen, the

other French. When each had done her singing, each ; way of keep-

“WRITE ME DOWN’” A • RECORD."
THE Record lately quoted from our last number some lines
relative to the Promenade Concert given in Kensington
Gardens on Sunday to the Public, by the QUEEN. To this
quotation were annexed certain comments, reviling us, of
course, for ribaldry and profaneness. Our sanctimonious
contemporary accused us, moreover, of advocating, in those
verses, the institution of JULLIEN’s concerts upon Sundays.
If the Record writer has ever been present at the concerts
of M.JULLIEN, he must know that they usually include
quadrilles, polkas, and other frivolous and trumpery pieces
of music, whereas the music which we represented as
proper for Sunday, was distinctly described by us as having,
on the mind of the hearer, an effect essentially and bene-
ficially spiritual.
Veracity is not the forte of any of the fanatical journals,
Popish or Protestant: but we do not accuse the Record man
of haying uttered, to the prejudice of Mr. Punch, the thing
that is not, knowing it not to be. We dare say that he has
not the most remote idea of what we mean by good music.
To him, probably, sacred music is parish psalmody; nothin
else, and nothing more; miserable and vulgar tunes marri
to equally, miserable and vulgar verses; such as the doggerel
into which NICHOLAS BRADY and NAHUM TATE have pre-
sumed to turn the Scriptures, in diluting, corrupting, and
rhyming, the songs of DAVID.
Sacredness in music, as apprehended by him, is probably
what, to any person with an average ear, and ordinary
sensibilities, is maudlin dreariness; asthetically, the same
thing as the groaning, and moaning, and whining in the
pulpit, accepted by the sect which he represents for
devotional expression. Iſis allowance of ear, however, may
be said to be considerably above the average, and in re-

it is—which is likely to be destroyed rather than preserved

º “finally resolved that

But it seems that many
of the Aldermen had
strong feelings, upon
the su jihº,
that the inscription
ought to say a great |h
deal more. One of
This epigraph excited some approbation, and but
for the envy of other Aldermen and poets, would
have been at this moment on the pe estal." But
it was opposed by AIDERMAN GREENFAT, who,
with a loud voice, read his own composition:-
“To Sir Robeat PEEL, Bart.,
The City gives applause,
For taking an active part
In taking off the Corn Laws.”
ALDERMAN GLOBULAR thought that both of
these were well, so far as they went, but still
he considered that the Aldermen “ought to be
brought in somehow,” and he proposed to intro-
duce them as follows:–
“The Aldermen of London
Can appreciate public merit,
So erect this figure of PEEL
On account of his public spirit.”
The neatest inscription of all was, however,
tendered by ALDERMAN GHERKINs, who sugges-
ted this—
“Erected to SIR Ron ERT PEEL,
Because we think he did a deal
Of service to the common-weal."
A, fierce debate, however, arose upon the last
word of this composition, some maintaining that
it ought to be spelt “wheel,” being an allusion
to the helm of state, and others—indeed, the
majority, contending that its initial should be a
“v,” which produced some sarcasms of the usual
civic elegance, in which the changes were pleas-
ingly rung upon yeal and calf; and finally, after
a great storm, the Meeting sulkily decided that
there should be no inscription at all, except what
as been mentioned. And this is certainly the
right decision, for the less very small men have
them considered that the names of all the civic dignitaries who conspired to do the statesman
this remarkable honour ought to be engraven on the pedestal, as it would naturally add
to his fame if the world knew what very great men had thought well of him. Several had
prepared inscriptions, for which they fought with much animosity. The kindness of an offi-
cial supplies us with a copy of these. ALDERMAN GRUNTER moved the following—
to say about a very great man the better.

And so this is erected in Cheapside.”
that the fashionable mushroom hats are to be
called Ladies’ All-rounders,
OLD BRICKS AND OLD MORTARS.
YEs—we are an exceedingly practical people:
The History of England that virtue will show.
We don’t trust our eyes, when they say “there’s a steeple,”
But, bang, with our noses against it we go.
And not till our noses bleed after collision,
Do we feel we’re entitled to say, with decision,
“Yes—it is solid stonework, and not a mere vision,”
And the practical proof quite makes up for the blow.
|
-
Hence our wars have been triumphs: for, when we commenced them,
We conclusively proved all the stone walls we found,
By gallantly running our heads up against them,
inging out Q. E. D., as we came to the ground.
Thus we’ve proved the Crimea makes bad winter quarters,
And the proof has but cost us an army of martyrs:
To exact the same proof in all Russian waters,
Through our naval campaigns, we by logic are bound.
North-Sea skippers declared that the Baltic was shallow,
So, too, said the charts; but John BUIL’s not so flat
As, without some more practical proof, things to swallow,
On mere word-of-mouth and eye-witness, like that!
So of man-of-war stations our Whitehall assigners,
Send into the Baltic our first-rates and liners;
If they get aground, Sir, a fig for the shiners!—
That’s a practical proof there are shoals—perhum sat.
Theoretical writers maintain'd, for such waters, -
That gun-boats of some six feet draught were the thing:
That Russian forts to the pounding of mortars
(Though they mock point-blank fire) soon “peccavi" would sing.
Mere reasonings that gunboats are needed, we scout them!
Let’s have practical proof, first, by trying without them :
To show long guns won't knock the foes' casemates about them,
Long guns, and not mortars, against them we’ll bring.
Well, the practical proof–dear to BULL–has been given;
Qur liners have grounded, our long guns have fail’d— .
With short soundings and stonework in vain we have striven,
Wainly GRAHAM has written, and NAPIER has rail’d.
And at length—Hip-hurrah!—we’ve got ſº and mortars;
And now, spite of granite and sands and shoal waters,
Our Tars will soon have their own way with the Tartars:
* Sweaborg first, and then Cronstadt will soon be assail’d.
“But hold”—say the theorists—“mortars, 'tis certain,
Will wear out with firing—the fact is well known,”
Is it so? We can't rest on mere random asserting;
By a practical proof we must have the fact shown.
Send our mortarboats out with no relay of metal,
If the mortars fail, mend’em, as tinkers a kettle;
If they burst—why, the practical point it will settle,
That honey-comb'd gun-metal's best let alone.
Here, too, we’ve had practical proof that with firing
Gun-metal will crystallise, . and burst;
But who, save joirs Buil, would have thought of requiring,
Loss of life, and a half-and-half victory first
But what if we have lost some men by explosion,
lſ the granite of Sweaborg still frowns o'er the ocean?
We’ve got practical proof of what was but a notion
Of a few closet-writers, in theories nursed.
Now ’tis fact, that old officers wear like old iron,
And this fact Mr. Punch in John BULL's head would fix;
With old mortars our arsenal yards we environ,
Why not with old mortars get rid of old bricks?
We have gouty old admirals, cranky and crusty,
Peninsular heroes, grey, mildew'd, and musty:
Let us not wait for practical proof how untrusty
A WELLINGTON's self grows at sixty-and-six.
The glorious old boys! Punch profoundly respects them.
He knows what they have been, but sees what they are:
Their duty to do, he, like England, expects them—
Which is to lie up, and nurse chalkstone and scar.
Let them warm their old bones in the sun, and have pensions—
John BULL can afford it—of monster dimensions,
And like NAPIER, confining to print their pretensions,
With insular pen wage Peninsular war!

OBSERVATIONS ABROAD.
(By A PREJudiced MAN.)
PERHAPs there is no more striking difference between the gross English and the refined
French than in the matter of eating. “Les Anglais /–Mon Dieu/ Comme ils mangent/"
says your Parisian, and with reason, no doubt. For young MR. BULL would, in all probability,
have gone the length of eating an egg and a piece of dry toast, or even a rasher of bacon,
with a cup of tea, by way of breakfast; whereas the young fellows in the picture have had
nothing in the world but a couple of fowls, with nice greasy sauce—a dish of cutlets, accom-
panied by mushrooms, olives, and cockscombs—a melon—a bowl of eggs beaten up with
truffles—about a pint of currant juice and iced water—a large crayfish, or lobster, a bottle of
ordinary red wine, some salad, with plenty of oil, four peaches, two apricots, a dish of potatoes
3 la maître d'hôtel, two cups of coffee and some rum, a yard and a half of bread, and just a
handful or so of radishes, a few almond and ratifia cakes, and a dozen lumps of sugar I "How
much more delicate and sensible is such a meal! And yet, somehow or other, at the age of
thirty, a Frenchman is generally obliged to wear stays to preserve his figure, and he has no
digestion to speak of.
The more gold we expend,
The more Cossacks we end
To Nicholas, who loosed them on mankind.
How much of life we save,
In smashing every slave,
To work a Tyrant's murderous will design'd?
Delightful is the note,
From the blazing iron throat,
Answering the Muscovite hyaena's yell
When, Liberty to crush,

A PROBABLE GLUT OF GENIUSES.
AN anonymous individual, who is quite right
in concealing his name, has given 10,000 francs
some £400, to be distributed in prizes to men of
letters of every degree, and of every nation. We
tremble to think of the number of geese that
will be sacrificed to provide quills for the myriads
who will rush into manuscript on the chance of
obtaining a share of the proffered plunder. The
highest prize is one of £40, for the best novel,
consisting of not less than 50,000, and not more
than 60,000 letters. We suspect that even the
successful competitor will starve before an award
can be made, for the arbitrators cannot come to
a decision until they have counted all the letters
in all the novels that may be sent in for adjudica-
tion; and when this operation has been gone
through, it will be necessary to read every one of
the million manuscripts that will pour in upon
the harassed judges.
When all this has been done, there will still
remain the task of º: some £200
among the authors of second rank; and as the
numbers of those who come off second-best in
the literary world are incalculable, we look with
real horror on the task that has been imposed on
those who have been appointed to adjudicate.

PUNCH, OR
THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“PLEASE 'M, HERE's Fido BEEN A Rollin' of HIMSELF IN THE
“KETCH 'EM Alive, O !’”
ENGLISH CONVERSATION.
MR. PUNCH has read in some book or other, that “Conversation is a
difficult Art.”. Like most things in most books (except a series of
yolumes of which this is the twenty-ninth) the statement is ridiculous.
Conyersation is perfectly, easy. In England, especially, the art is
carried to the utmost pitch of perfection. You have only to listen to
what takes place in the omnibus, or on the steamboat, or in the next
box at the opera or eating-house, or as you come home from church, or
in the railway train, or in any other place where people talk publicly,
to be convinced that English people talk remarkably well—that their
conversation is easy, precise, pointed, full of information, instructive
but not pedantic, lively but not flippant, bold but not audacious, serious
but not didactic, and a great many other things, but not a great many
other things, and, in short, that the British Public talks admirably, .
Eager for the honour of his native land, Mr. Punch has been taking
notes of a good deal of Conversation which has lately reached his
immortal ears. And in proof of the justness of his eulogium, he
subjoins a specimen of a brilliant dialogue which occupied and amused
the j. individuals who delivered it, all the way from the Nine
Elms Pier to Blackfriars Bridge. He took it down in short hand, and
his notes may be seen on application at the publisher's.

THIS IS CAPTAIN GOGGLES, WHO WOULD SIT FORWARD IN A
HANSOM WHEN IT CAME ON TO RAIN.
A COMPLAINT FROM THE PADDLE-BOX.
By a Captain in the Above-Bridge Service.
ALL down the Thames I steam until I’m ill, O !
All down the Thames to London Bridge from Kew :
And I’m forced by way of antidote before I seek my pillow,
With § draught that is so black to wash down the pill
SO Olue.
If any one should ask me the reason why I sicken,
I tell him 'tis because I live on liquified manure:
For while all the drains of London the Thames with garbage
thicken,
Though its tide be e'er so slow, it will certainly be sewer.
Beside the drains, the bone-mills all add their ſoul out-pour.
1ngs,
And gaseous filth from gas-works flows in emetic streams;
And while the dirt at bottom defies all tidal scourings,
With cat and dog inanimate the surface thickly teems.
Then all down the Thames small wonder I’m so ill, O!
| And shall be until Parliament to cleanse it finds the way:
But except the River-Cholera some sitting Member kill, O !
The House, I fear, won't listen to advice from FARADAY.
THE IMPASSABLE PARK.
PRINCE ALBERT is Ranger of St. James's Park. He has
a fine view of it from the front of Buckingham Palace. The
prospect of the busy multitude of foot-passengers, diversified
by nursemaids and hoop-trundling children, must be pleas-
ing to his Royal Highness of a fine morning, when, full of
benevolence and breakfast, he surveys that scene from one
of the windows, with a serene countenance, and his hands
behind him under the tail of his dressing-gown. But he
must observe one deficiency in the spectacle. He beholds
his Royal Consort's foot subjects, but not HER MAJESTY's
horse. The comfortable carriage and convenient cab do not
cross the field of his vision. The look-out is pretty enough,
but deficient in the Hansom. PRINCE ALBERT being, as
aforesaid, Ranger of the Park, has the power, and doubtless
only wants the hint, to do the handsome thing by conceding
a carriage way across it to the cabs.
STREET NAMES.
AMONG the numerous benefits which London will derive from the
new Act for the Government of the Metropolis, is a revision of the
system of street momenclature. The mass of King Streets, Queen
Streets, Victoria Streets, Albert Streets, and the like, will have to sort
themselves. To each King Street will be put the Shakspearian
question, “Under which King, Bezonian P’’ and the Queens will be
expected to be equally explicit, and to apply to Miss STRICKLAND for
separate christening. Victoria Street (and Punch Street) will be names
restricted to the very highest order of thoroughfare, morally, socially,
and architecturally considered; and the Albert Streets, with perhaps a
couple of exceptions at opposite quarters of the town, will be ; Off
into Consort Street, Hat Street, Night-light Street, and other titles
which, preserving affinity, may avoid confusion.
Equal justice will be meted out to the plebeian localities. SMITH and
BRowN will not be allowed to stud districts all over with Smith Streets
and Brown Terraces, nor will it be held sufficient reason for having
eleven Mary-Ann Places in one suburban parish, that eleven respectable
and uxorious builders have wives of that name. As for John Street
James Street, William Street, Alexander Street, Henry Street, Edward
Street, and all the other streets with mere praenomina, they must pre-
pare, to take less ridiculous appellations. A Christian man may be
entitled to be called a brick, but bricks are not entitled to the Christian
name of a man.
A register is to be opened, and every street is to have its own name
recorded, and no street to take that of another. Why, indeed, should
it?, What is the use of an alias to a street? It can always be identi-
fied if it gets into disgrace; and though one street often runs into
another, it is sure to be caught. We hope, therefore, that all decent
streets will hasten to obtain their own distinctive names.
..Some difficulty, it is thought, may arise in the selection of the new
titles, and inhabitants who have settled placidly down under the no.
meaning names of Pleasant Row, Prospect Terrace, the Paragon, or the
simply declarative River Terrace, Thames Bank, or Parliament Street,
may rebel against any title which may have more definite associations.
But, while respecting this English feeling, let us remind such persons
that no vow of allegiance is at present held to be implied by residence
in a street with ever so specific a name. Living in Wellington Street
ou to go about in Wellington boots, residing in
Grosvenor Row does not pledge you to the Sunday Trade Bill,
chambers in Regent Street do not make you an admirer of GEORGE
TURVEYDROP, a house in Gordon Square does not constitute you a wor-
shipper of Lorp ABERDEEN, and you may dwell in Wood Street and yet
join the rest of your fellow creatures in considering the First Lord of
the Admiralty novery great statesman. Did a house suit Mr. Punch, were
there hot and cold water to the top, no black beetles or church bells to
be seen or heard, and the taxes reasonable, he would not hesitate to live
therein, even though the street were called after MR. DUFFY or
MR. CALCRAFT.
A Commission, with Mr. Punch at its head, will probably issue for
the allotment of names, and literature may be enabled to render some
assistance in the business. He is not inclined to forestal his work by
ublishing his whole plan, because in that case Government would pro-
ably steal it, and give him no money. But he will furnish a specimen
of his notion. He would divide London into districts, and by means of
his own immense topographical knowledge—not that he would not be
glad of the co-operation of his friends PETER Cunning HAM, and JoHN
TIMBs—he would decide what feature gave worthiest historical, social,
or other characteristic to the prescribed locality. Settling this, the
feature in question should give the key to the nomenclature. Suppose,
for instance, that the district included the New Palace of Westminster.
This is, evidently, the key required. Parliament Street exists. Add to
it ford Street, &: Street, Throne Street, Speaker Street, Mace
Street, Bauble Street, Green-Box Alley, Black Rod Passage, Lobby
Street, Order Street, Bill Street, Vote Street, Count Street, Bore
Street, Bribe Street, froñigate and Unexampled Expenditure Street
and so forth. Observe the great advantage of this system. It would
make no second title necessary. Who, hears the word Bore or Bribe,
and does not instantly think of Westminster?
Take another instance. Suppose Drury Lane theatre were the feature
of the district whose streets required names. Preserve Drury Lane.
Add Kemble, Street, Kean Street, Young Street, Siddons Street,
O'Neill Street, Macready Street, Westris Street, Braham Street, Mali.
bran Street, Stanfield Street, Grieve Street. Or, if it would not be toq
humiliating to a respectable locality, even the names of authors and

his works in the differ.
ent newspapers. We
are beginning to be al-
most as familiar with
the name of CUMMING
as we are with those of
Holloway and a few
others, who will go
down to posterity in
the supplement to the
Times, or the adver-
tising sheets of the
Quarterlies. It no
doubt answers the pur-
se of the pious pub-
ishers who wish to sell
a few extra copies of
the Voices of the Wight
or of the Morning, or
of the Afternoon, or of
any other hour that
may be thought suited
- º to the taste of the day,
to render DR. CUMMING notorious in newspaper paragraphs; but to the Reverend Gentleman
himself it must be—or it ought to be—most distasteful to have his “reputation kept alive,” as
the commercial phrase goes, by continual puffing. The latest instance we have seen of this
kind of §§ is a puff for one of DR. CUMMING's Sermons, which is said to have been preached
before SIR.J. CAMPBELL, previous to his leaving for the º: which Sermon is said to have
made him “ready to die as a Christian,” and he accordingly “fought and fell like a hero.”
Of course the inference is, that the Reverend Gentleman's Sermon was the cause of the
Christian heroism of the unfortunate, but gallant General, who we have no doubt would have
manifested all the noble qualities he evinced, even if he had not attended the Chapel in Crown
Court, Covent Garden, before proceeding, to Sebastopol. We hope we shall hear no more of i
gallant officers having been preached to death by DR. CUMMING.
EREAK DOWN OF THE INCOME TAX CART.
We have to announce a break down of the Income Tax Cart, whereby the CHANCELLOR of
THE ExchequER has been thrown out, but no one as º appears to have been seriously
ured. The accident was owing to a defect in one of the wheels, known as Schedule D,
which moves on the swindle, or unequal pressure principle.
... The Times, in commenting on the occurrence, observes, that Schedule D does not yield what
it ought to do, and illustrates this remark by the statement, that there are only § persons
in Great Britain returning between £900 and £1000 annual profits from trades or professions,
and that the number of those who return between £1000 and £2000, from the same sources,
does not exceed 5,350. That the Income Tax Cart should have thus broken down will not
surprise those who long ago foresaw that the vicious principle on which Schedule D was
constructed would sooner or later insure its failure.
No doubt this is a bad job, and our leading contemporary has reason in urging that the Tax
Cart must be got to go, if the War is to be carried on; and that the War must be carried
on, or the Cossacks will triumph over us. Qf course, it is a great, plague to Government
that the º: will not pay up and greas; the unlucky wheel of this fiscal vehicle. It is
natural that every, Minister should have “complained very bitterly” of that shortcoming.
But then, how bitterly did the industrious public complain of Schedule D1 They complained
piteously of the shame and the wrong, of taxing the whole sum of one man's earnings
inithéinterest only of another's capital; the entire property of Jones, and merely apart of
ROBINson's—that part being precarious. They
cried out, on the monstrousness of taxing an
income which, long before the call of the col-
lector, might have ceased to come in. They
cried, not indeed to deaf ears, but to callous
hearts. The iniquity was admitted: the answer
was, that they must grin and bear it. This is
the language of cool unprincipled Force address-
ing the helpless. ost people obey such a
recommendation as far as they please, and no
farther than they must. They grin; but instead
of grinning and bearing the injustice, they grin:
.# if possible, evade it. They grin, and evade
Schedule D, and the income Tax Cart breaks
Tell men to grin and bear the confiscation
that you are able to enforce at the point of the
bayonet; but don't be so silly as to give that
advice to persons whose own conscience is, the
instrument by which you mean to subject them
to extortion. What verdure a statesman must
imagine that he sees in the eyes of a people,
whom he expects to afford the information which
he asks for, avowedly in order to bamboozle
them. It is wisdom almost worthy of MR.
MERRYMAN to propose to swindle any person,
with the knowledge of that person, by means of
questioning him upon his honour. To question
any one for such a purpose, you should use the
thumbscrews. It may be the duty of the un-
fairly-taxed victim to be an accessory to the
fraud which Government seeks to practise on
him. lf an incorrigibly insolvent rogue, whom
ou do not wish to offend, asks you if you
ave five pounds about you, with a view to bor-
row the money, the rule of strict veracity may
require that you should answer in the affirmative,
if you cannot, in accordance with fact, reply in
the negative. But except our noble selves, and
a very few others, frail mortals appear to be
incapable of such exalted morality—and so we
have a break down of the Income Tax Cart.
Very lax, very lamentable, perhaps; a sad
bluntness of moral sense may be evinced in
meeting imposition with subterfuge, instead of
yielding to it with simplicity. A truly conscien-
tious man, perhaps, would rather be a party to .
cheating himself than cheat the Government, if
obliged to do one or the other. The generality
of people under such circumstances give them-
selves the benefit of the doubt. This is human
nature, in the face of which Chancellors of the
Exchequer must not, fly: if they do, Tax Carts
break à. Indeed, how is an unrighteous tax
ever to be got rid of, but by making Governments
discover that it will not answer P Let us have a
new Tax Cart—one that will go-rolling along
equitably. Our admirals and generals have just
found out that mortars are the best means for
a bombardment. Perhaps Ministers mav, by
deep study, arrive at as great and as simple a
iscovery in taxation. bat if an increase in
the Inhabited House Tax would furnish a satis-

be evaded, and which there would be no excuse
for evading if it could. At least, a man's house

Related by JoHN CoLLIN; his age is fifty-two, -
Of his two sons sent to Chelmsford Gaol for attending a Review.
The one is Thomas CoILIN, the other GEORGE by name;
GEORGE Collin is a married man and Thomas is the same.
GEORGE Collin he has one child and Thomas he has five,
Whom a Reverend Beak for fourteen days of their fathers did deprive.
John CoLLIN’s deposition, sworn to and taken down
Declares that he and his two sons were at work for Joseph BRowN,
Qf Roydon Hamlet, Essex—a sheep-jobber is he-
Ånd likewise a small farmer of petty mean degree.
Twas on the fourth of August these two young men did say
To MB,CHURCH, BRowN's foreman, that they wanted half a day,
To see the Essex Yeomanry review'd on Nazing-mead,
Whereto the foreman neither objected nor agreed.
Upon the following Monday, John Collin said and swore,
That he and his two sons got up as soon as half-past-four,
Which was before their regular time, their master's work to do,
So that they shouldn't wrong him by their going to Review.
They work'd till one o'clock, when CHURCH bade them to cease to
mow,
Then THQMAs unto Nazing-mead immediately did go,
GeoRº Collis follow’d after in about another hour,
Not thinking of curmudgeons, nor of Jack Priests in power.
On Tuesday and on Wednesday they work'd as they were wont,
On Thursday MR. Joseph BRówn call'd them unto account,
Before a reverend magistrate, George HEMMING is his name,
Who gave these poor men fourteen days' hard labour. What a shame!
On the REveREND GEORGE HEMMING did FARMER BRowN prevail
To give these honest young men a fortnight in Chelmsford gaol,
Along with rogues and scoundrels of base and wicked lives,
To work upon the treadmill torn from their families and wives.
In vain did MAJoR PALMER their hard case represent;
The Home Office would not remit their cruel punishment.
Inquiry on the subject having been, by SIR GEORGE GREy,
§§§. HEMMING made, to hear what he had got to say.
Three groans for PARson HEMMING and three for FARMER BRown;
And I think I see three scarecrows paraded through the town;
Then in a bonfire blazing, with a smell of pitch and tar,
A Parson, and a Farmer, and his Majesty the CzAR.

That would discourage fine young men from going to reviews,
Likewise to every Justice, whether clerical or lay, .
That backs them up in putting any hindrance in their way!

A PRODIGY IN THE PULPIT.
| OMETIMEs in ancient Rome the oxused to speak,
but till lately the bovine species has not been
'Known to utter articulate language in this
country. Rustics, of all people, have the
greatest experience of horned cattle; yet no
rural person, worthy of credit, has asserted
iº to have heard any animal of that kind
say anything, from time immemorial up to Sun-
day the 26th ult, when, according to a state-
ment in a letter to the Times, made by “A
MILITIAMAN” of the West Essex Regiment
in a calf walked into Moulsham Church, ascende
Wºl the pulpit and pronounced the following
words:-
“Now the people of the City of Corinth were ex-
ceedingly wicked people, for they were idolators, and
indulged in evil and idle sports; and the people of
Chelmsford would be equally as wicked as the people of
the City of Corinth, if they (the people of Chelmsford)
were all like the Militia.”
The calf then, says the MILITIAMAN, “proceeded with his Sermon,
wherein he again expressed himself as follows upon his own respon-
sibility:—”
* That the people of Chelmsford were tired and disgusted with the Militia, and that
they (the Militia) were a perfect nuisance to the town; that the people of Chelmsford
wished them away; that the Militia were going headlong to Hell–nay, every day
deeper and deeper.'
Sensible, no doubt, of the likelihood that these assertions would
encounter general incredulity, the “MILITIAMAN" does not call the
calf a calf, but names it the REveREND MR. WILson. But, º: it
is more easy to believe that the language above quoted proceeded from
a calf than from a clergyman. Yes—beyond doubt, if the words were
uttered at all, the tongue that spoke them might be an ingredient of

ASTONISHING THE “BROWNS.”
THE Laureate says that we are fools to trust “a tradesman's ware or
word,” but we hope that we may be permitted to recognise his polite-
ness. The remark is forced from us by observing the exquisite mode in
which the West-End traders now return us our very small change.
Before us lies the sum of two-pence, which, with a bottle of soda-water,
we have received from a Pimlico chemist, in return for a sixpence. The
“coppers” are enclosed in the neatest little square scented envelope,
on which is embossed a charming wreath of lilies and roses, the latter
coloured rosy red, and this legend is intertwined with the flowers–
“Cht Change—with Chanks.” Can politeness go farther?, Echo
answers in the affirmative, for we understand that other tradesmen
have even blander phrases engraven on their packets. One hands you
the change, inscribed, “What a lovely day!” Another, with an eye tº
business, says, “With hope to see you again,” and a third, “Wºuld
you recommend our articles?” The S aniards used to perfume their
money. The Englishman does this, and more—he . you perfumed

In the knapsacks of the Russian prisoners were found bread made of

day, SERGEANT BRooie, of the
First Royal Dragoons, whose con-
ductin preventing the duel in con-
nection with the ‘practical joking,'
has repeatedly been referred to in
these columns, proceeded, accord-

undergo the usual inspection pre-
vious to being discharged from
HER MAJESTY's Service; while
ADJUTANT WEBstER, who prompt-
ed the duel, and ordered his men
to “knock the Sergeant down with
the butt end of their carbines' if
he resisted being taken to the
guard-room, for preventing its
consummation, has been promoted
to a captaincy in the Turkish
Contingent, the Sergeant is to be
rewarded by his discharge from
the Service!”
Military justice is of a nature so peculiar that we beg to suggest an
illustration of it in the shape of a statue to be placed in front of the
building in St. James's Park, which is consecrated to the martial
authorities. The statue of Military Justice should be represented with
the sword of course, and also with the bandage, but let the latter,
instead of being tied over both eyes, cover only one eye, and let that
one be the right.
LETTERS REWARDED.—“NOCTES AMBROSIANZE.”
IT is not to be expected of flesh and blood—for Punch is no longer
ligneous; Punch, as Samuel Johnson would now allow, has feelings-
it is not for Punch, then, to suffer any reward vouchsafed by authorit
to letters, to pass unheeded, unacknowledged... We know not, indeed,
what may be in store for literature. , We believe that we violate no
confidence—and if we do, we cannot help it; joy, in its expression, is
apt to be incautious—when we state that a late Royal visit to our dear
and affectionate Allies may abound with much future §§ to Literature,
Art, and Science, France and England mutually feel that, they can in
no better, no stronger way, consolidate the alliance than by each
copying the excellences of each. . Therefore, England is about to pay
France the first compliment of imitation. In France, writers, painters
men of Art and science have, time out of mind, been acknowledged, an
from time to time, in so far as the state could dignify, dignified. Even
in the time of Louis THE FourTEENTH, Versailles was little more than
a palace-of-ease to poets, dramatists, painters, sculptors. They were
the birds of the sun; more considered by the Grand Monarch, than
were the ducks of St. James by his brother king and bought flunkey,
CHARLEs THE Second. And so, with a difference, it was with §.
NAºi, and so, it is again to be, with Nephew, Louis. This
pleasing fact was made very evident, on the QUEEN’s visit to Versailles
and other places, where men of genius were invited, and—no spoons
were missing !
It will be remembered that our excellent ambassador, LoRD CowLEY,
has been attacked in the columns of the Times—(the usual pillory for
ſº goodness, misinterpreted benevolence,)—because, forsooth,
e was not disposed to acknowledge the existence of English jurymen;
individuals, mixed up with literature and science, whom his Lordship,
by means of his Lordship's bellicose porter, kept at extremest arm’s
length. “Literature and science not admitted” were written—but in
shortest hand—upon that porter's forehead. It is now to be otherwise:
the frontal notice is to be forthwith erased: and, in obedience to the
advice ºf a distinguished Prince, LoRD Cowley is henceforth to receive
men of letters, Art, and science. His Lordship felt that he might have
justified his late ignorance of English jurymen by the example set in
the Royal palaces of Great Britain, but his Lordship is a courtier, and
as a courtier, held his tongue.
However, reward of the right men who have written the right books,
chiselled the right statues, and made the right discoveries, will hence.
forth be of daily occurrence. The first person, happily selected to
illustrate the new and better order of things is PROFEsson. FERRIER of
Edinburgh, The Professor, it may not i. nerally known, is the
editor of the collected works of PROFºssoR WILsoN; a man of ve
varied genius—a man who could dash off a Highland landscape, all fres
equalled by the physical|nº made his cave echo with blither bellowings, than did

with, the morning dew still glittering on it, a man, moreover, who
could impale either man or woman, if wickedly Whiggish, upon his
pen, with all the ease of heart, all the loud º; of a schoolboy
who runs a corking-pin through the bowels of a cockchafer. Poly-
PhEMUs never took a human marrow-bone with greater enjoyment,
HRISTO-
PHER North feel and utter, when he devoured alive, bones and all, a
wretched Radical! At such meals, his countryman, SAwNEY BEANE,
was not a fuller feeder. At Christopher’s Noctes Ambrosiana
|human hearts were served up—like the k's brains at LUCULLUs’
|suppers—a hundred to a dish. But these were strong-stomached times.
|A reputation—like a pullet, the whiter the better-was a mere mouth-
full. MR. MARTIN, i. by the cook CHRISTQPHER (he cooked his
own dishes), was served up as “an Irish jackass.” Joseph HUME la
on the sideboard as “a poor creature in mind, soul, and heart.”
BROUGHAM smoked as “a Billingsgate fish-wife,” M'CULLOCH as “an
obscure and insolent lout,”–and so forth; for we may not dwell upon
half the number of dishes that, from month to month, was served up by
the Apician CHRISTOPHER. -
Well, as we have said, certain party men had strong stomachs in
those days, and they, doubtless, enjoyed these things, even as a Kaffir
enjoys his rough meal of swine intestines. When, however, the col-
lected works of WILSON were first talked about, timid folks feared that
the Noctes would make no part of the reprint: they feared that they
might be allowed to pass away with the offal, the dead rats, and
drowned kittens that were once so buoyant, so biting and so scratching,
in the kindred columns of the Age and Satirist. Such timorous men
knew not the stuff whereof PROFEssoR FERRIER was compounded,
That conscientious editor has thought it a solemn duty to reproduce all
the dishes compounded and gloated over by the living CHRISTOPHER.
They were sweet and fragrant to the nostrils of an age when Toryism
tyrannised in the Commons, and doubted on the Woolsack; and, like
spices extracted from mummies, they must have a smack, a flavour
still. We must in 1855 still enjoy the memory of a good, eccentrio
man, as “an Irish jackass,” must still º heartily to have LoRD
BRough AM, a “Billingsgate fish-wife,”—still acknowledge the delicious

Out
With an industry only equalled by his conscientiousness has PRO-
FEssoR FERRIER so far acquitted himself of his edition of Noctes
Ambrosianae. The more pleasant part remains to be told. For reward
of the Professor's services, the learned gentleman has been offered,
under the operation of SIR Benjamin HAſſº's Metropolitan Act, a very
distinguished position in the sewers. Here, certainly, we have the
right man in the right place.
A FRENCEI BULL TAKEN BY THE HORNS.
John BULL is now a very familiar object in Paris, but an Irish Bull
is still a novelty in France, though one of our French contemporaries
has recently favoured us with what almost deserves to be termed the
Ba'uf Gras of Bulls of Irish origin. In speaking of recent, events, the
Constitutionnel observes, “We see everywhere in France the invisible
hand of Providence.” Our contemporary is, we admit, endowed with
a good deal of penetration, and more than an average share of keen-
sightedness, but, his being able to “see everywhere” that which is
“invisible,” evinces, an amount of visual power which we should not
have given him credit for. . When a writer begins an article by saying
“Nous voyons partout l'invisible,” &c. &c., we decline trusting our eyes
any further in the perusal of his remarks, lest we should see something
that is not to be seen, or lest in what our eye rests upon, we may be so
unfortunate as to see nothing. When a writer begins seeing the
invisible, the chances are, that he will proceed to utter some unutterable
stuff, or to touch upon that which is not tangible, and we therefore
think it better to drop what he has let drop, by putting down the paper.
Translation and Traduction,
SoME of the Handbooks to Paris are very good, but others, we think,
err in carrying to excess the attempt to render the names, of Parisian
localities into our vern For example, we have no objection to a
writer who tries to make his reader feel at home by calling the Rue des
Marais, Marsh Lane, or translating Rue d'Enfer into Holywell Street.
But we consider that he goes too far in calling the Rue des Trois Cow-
ronnes, Fifteen Shilling Street, terming the %. de Malte, Beer Street,
or denoting the Avenue des Anes as Alderman's Walk. This is what
Ophelia calls, “wearing your Rue with a difference.”
An Axe-idental Joke.
“WE met a fool in the forest” who had the audacity to ask us
the following conundrum:-
Why cannot the proprietor of this forest fell his own timber?-
Because no one is allowed to cut, when it’s his own deal.

RUSSIAN VERSION OF THE QUEEN'S VISIT
TO PARIS.
WE borrow the following statement from the Invalide Russe:-
The visit of QUEENVICTORIA and PRINCE ALBERT to Louis NAPOLEON
as proved a failure. The fºes f. to the BRITISH QUEEN were ve
poor and mean affairs, strikingly manifesting the exhaustion to whic
the French nation, has been reduced by the impious war in which it is
engaged against the children of the Orthodox Church, and its Father,
our august §
. The fête at the Hôtel de Ville, given by the City of Paris at the dicta-
tion of the EMPEROR, surpassed in dulness and heaviness anything of
the kind hitherto attempted. The Rue de Rivoli, and a portion of the
uays were decorated with some old flags, which were mostly worn out
theatrical properties. The Place of the Hôtel de Wiii, was stuck about
with a few smoky lamps enclosed in coloured paper. The vestibule was
hung with bunches of faded flowers, and tapestry of the same descrip-
tion, behind which some bands were stationed, which played God Sape
the Queen, and Rule Britannia, out of tune, whilst the populace outside
sang Marlbruk.
A few persons collected in lines between the Tuileries and Hôtel de
Wille to see their Majesties. They cried “A basles Anglais /*and “Vive
Henri Qing!” though some shouts of “Vive la République /* were also
mº with their imprecations.
The Royal personages were hissed all the way to Vincennes, and at
one of their visits to the Exhibition an oyster-shell was wn at the
Rºº. É. - -
he Review in the Champ de Mars was a miserable demonstration.
The French Army, decimated by its defeats in the Crimea, could furnish
but a mere handful of men for the occasion. -
At the Tomb of old NAPOLEON, the QUEEN evinced uneasiness, and
the EMPEROR frowned.
UEEN VICTORIA remarked, in the hearing of her Ally, that the display
at Versailles was nothing, compared to that exhibited every night at the
tea º at London, called Cremorne.
The fireworks prepared to signalise the departure of her Britannic
MAJESTY and the Prince CoNsort from Boulogne refused to go off, with
the exception of a few squibs.
It is said that the QUEEN and the EMPREss more than once exchanged
angry words on some question of precedence. The former looked thin,
haggard, and sulky, the latter more than usually plain, and intensely
isgusted.
#. QUEEN has sent a few sous for distribution among the poor of
Paris. This parsimony is not to be wondered at, considering the state
# º bankruptcy on which England is bordering, by reason of
6 War.
THE PRELIMINARIES OF PEACE.
PRINCE DOLGoRouski, Prince of Cutthroats and Assassins—for does
he not adopt and justify the Hango massacre?—alleges, in one of his
avowals of that atrocity, to which he has constituted himself accessory
after the fact, that—
“LIEUTENANT GENESTE, of the Royal Navy, landed without waiting for his character
as flag of truce to be legally admitted and recognised by the authorities.”
How to get a flag of truce admitted and recognised by the Russian
authorities is a question which will naturally occur to the French or
English Commanding Officer who may desire to send one to our mis-
creant enemy. Its solution will not be difficult. In letting them know
that a flag of truce is coming, it is necessary to keep out of their reach
and the obvious mode of intimating to them the approach of one, will
be, to precede the flag of truce with a discharge of shells, at a long
range, pitched accurately into the midst of the murderous authorities.
The Navvy of Netherby.
SIR. JAMEs GRAHAM, the other day, turned the first sod of the
Silloth Railway. This was a navvy's work to be sure: but the Right
Honourable Baronet could have condescended to a much more
unworthy employment. , , SIGNOR MAzzINI. M.R. LAYARD, and SIR
CHARLEs NAPIER, could mention much dirtier jobs, of which the
performance might be possible to SIR JAMES GRAHAM.

The Pope and the Conclave, and Priesthood all,
By sea and land, and all abroad,
They flung out their rope of lies and fraud.
A few crazed consciences in they drew,
And a nest of addled brains or two,
But for aught beyond this they strove in vain-
And the rope kept snapping at every strain.
Yet to knot and splice that rotten old rope,
Still toil the Cardinals, toils the Pope; .

OUR QUEEN AND OURSELVES.
THE Parisians were maturally very much puzzled at the daily
announcement in the Moniteur that QUEEN VICTORIA had taken Lunch
at one o'clock, and i."; one was full of curiosity to know the nature
of Le Lunch, to which HER MAJESTY was so constantly devoted. At
length it seems to have struck all Paris—of a heap—that Le Lunch was
a misprint for Le Punch, and the mystery was at once solved, for the
supposition became º among our French neighbours, that the
QUEEN set apart the hour of one every day for the perusal and study of
*Wºl. periodical.
... We have authority—our own—for stating that this view of the sub-
ject is in exact accordance with the facts, and that those who have
ignorantly supposed Le Punch, to be a mere physical kind of gro
instead of a rich intellectual draught, which Royalty drinks in §
appreciation and delight, are completely in error. No one is more
sensible than H&R MAJESTY of the force and value of a good example,
and when it is known, through the medium of the whole European
Press, that QUEEN VICTORIA devotes the best period of the day to her
Punch, it is probable that other crowned heads may be induced to
“improve the shining hour,” by a similar excellent use of it.
King Bomba Rewarded.
THE POPE is about to give his Orders!. On the Festival of the
Nativity he will, it is said, found “a new order of chivalry—the Order
of the Immaculate. Conception.” The KING or NAPLEs, it is widely
reported, will receive the ºf first Order—and for this sufficient reason.
He will become a Knight of the Immaculate Conception, because as a
King, he is a potentate more easily conceived than described.

A LANSDOWNE TO THE RESCUE!
THE matter has appeared in print, as it ought; and therefore Punch
may make a note of a new act of goodness on the part of the good
LoRD LANSDowne,—ever, ready, open-handed, to give more than a
cordial shake to the hand of genius. FRANCEs BRowNE, the blind
oetess, is permitted by the Government to make the experiment of a
ivelihood on £50 a-year. Even this she owes to the sympathetic
liberality of the late SIR. Robert PEEL; and even this is not paid out
of the miserable dole voted for the encouragement of science, literature
and art. Lately LQRD LANsdowne read a very sweet poem in the
Athenaeum , written by FRANCEs, BRowNE, called It is come. His
Lordship inquired into the worldly circumstances of the outwardly
darkened poetess, and learned sufficient immediately to place at her
disposal the sum of £l00. A humane and noble act, but tº worthy
of the coronet of a LANSDown E. Mr. Punch especially the
attention of the EARL of ABERDEEN, to this circumstance. If º
weighed in his equitable, in this his É. time of leisure, with
the freshening influences of country life about him, it may, perhaps,
urge him to do a deed of conscience-money. For it cannot be other-
wise than that the late Premier must now and then have a twinge of
conscience, when he remembers that under his administration, no less
than £1050 were diverted from the £1200 voted for science, art, and
literature-leaving only £150 to be shared by MR. KEIGHTLEy. and the
widow of the gifted, laborious Doctor Kitto., However, if we are
compelled to give up ABERDEEN, let us, hope that at the next distri-
bution of the grant next year, foºp Pºpston will follow in the
good work begun by good LoRD LANSDown E.
A FOUL COPY.
THE imitation of PEEL in every respect is pro by SIR JAMEs
GRAHAM to himself. It will not do. §º. differ from
PERI, in wanting the property of being candid.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 109
THE INDIAN CANDIDATES.
It was stated in an Indian paper, that among the exercises proposed
to Candidates at the late Examination, (which has fallen like a bomb-
shell among “University reputations” and other questionabilities) was
a quaint device of SIR GEORGE STEPHEN's. That learned personage
conceived a cruel plan for testing the intimacy of a Candidate's ac-
quaintance with history. This was, to propose to him an imaginary
situation, in which real historical personages were placed, and from
which he was to deduce the probable consequences. Some only of SIR
GEORGE's problems have been given, e.g. “ Suppose that GUY FAwkes
had blown up KING JAMES THE FIRST and the Parliament, what would
have been the effect, besides the bang?” and “Suppose KING
Charles THE FIRST had escaped from Carisbrook Castle, what would
CRoMweLL have done, after hanging the guards?” But Mr. Punch,
who takes gº interest in all the educational processes of the day,
§ to SIR GEORGE STEPHEN for the whole of the papers, with the
didates' answers; and these SIR GEORGE very politely supplied.
For the benefit of future neophytes, (and especially for students of
Trinity College, Dublin, which disgraced itself. outrageously upon
occasion of this first endeavour to ascertain what its alumni are good
for, not one T. C. D. man succeeding), Mr., Punch has made a short
selection from these suppositious cases and their solutions.
1. An Oxford Man was asked,
sº that the Spanish Armada had not been destroyed, and
º jºini, had seized London, what would have been the
eitec
After due consideration he replied, very neatly—
The Spaniards, having deposed KING CHARLEs Time Second, would
probably have placed the Pretender, CHARLEs Edward, upon the
throne, with FERGUs M'Ivor as his Viceroy, and would have repealed
the Habeas Corpus and the Bill of Rights, and revoked the Abolition
of the Slave Trade, for which they were infamously celebrated. They
would naturally have proclaimed the Roman Catholic religion, and the
horrors of the Inquisition would have succeeded those of JUDGE
JEFFRIEs and LoRD MONMOUTH's assizes. Wae victis /
2. A Cambridge man was asked,
Had RICHARD CROMWELL resenbled his father, what course
would he have adopted on the death of the latter?
His reply was—
He would have taken prompt and unhesitating steps to secure his
power. Recalling CLAVERhouse from §. he would have en-
trusted the English army to that skilful but ruthless leader, and, placing
a garrison in the Tower, under the command of the veteran, LoRd
FALKLAND, he would have dispatched a fleet, led by BLAKE and DRAKE,
to assail the... of France, whose Regent, D'ORLEANs, enfeebled by
pleasure, could not have successfull opposed British valour. He would
thus have had leisure to put down #: intrigues of WALPoLE at home,
and to baffle the philosophic but atheistic BoLINGBRoke, afterwards
HENRY THE FourTH.
3. A student from Dublin was asked,
Had the ring given by QUEEN ELIZABETH to LoRD Essex been
re-delivered to her when he was under sentence, would it have
saved his life?
His answer (deducting the brogue) was—
. The faymale heart is imminently º and the soight of the
ring moight have revolved impressions which niver before existed in
the bosom of the Virgin Queen. In the beautiful terrums employed by
HoRACE, Humano capiti cervicem, she would have humanely preserved
his head. But the deep insults the miscreant traithor had lavished
upon unhappy Oireland, made that felon head a grateful offering at the
shroine of outraged nationality, and the leebation of his heart’s blood
t º: foot of the tree of liberty projuced a harvest of unadulterated
0yalty.
4. A London University Man was asked,
Suppose the elder. PITT, “that terrible cornet of horse,” had
been "muzzled,” as the Court desired, what result would
have been avoided ?
He meditated for a considerable time, and then said—
Perhaps he wouldn't have had the gout, translated WIRGIL, or fought
a duel with MR.TIERNEy. Also, there might not have been that
statue of him in Hanover Square, or the picture of his falling into the
arms of LoRD LYNDHURST, in the House of Lords.
5. A young Barrister in the Temple was asked,
Suppose that when the thieves were stealing the Great Seal from
the house of LoRD CHANCELLOR THURLow, in Great Ormond
Street, he had jumped out of bed and caught them, what pro-
ceedings would his lordship have i.
He promptly answered—
The question is a difficult one. The seal is a part or portion, as it
were, of the Court of Chancery, which is inchoate and incomplete with-
out it; and therefore, if the article had been conveyed from the premises,
an injunction to restrain the thieves from going away could not have
issued. I imagine that it would be held demurrable to treat the seal as
if it were a marine animal of the same name, or else, a seal being unre-
claimed, and of ferae naturae, an action of trespass upon the case in
which it was kept would be the right course. But on the whole, I
should have advised Lord THURLow to lock the fellows up in the
cellar, and bawl for the police.
6. A Youth from Glasgow was asked,
Had KING EDward THE FIRST died of the wound from which
his Consort, QUEEN ELEANOR, sucked the poison, what would
have been the consequence?
He instantly responded—
I dinna preceesely recal the ceercomstaunces, but I just, ken this
consequence, that, live or die, I wadna have paid the useless doctors ae
single bawbee.
15MIGRATION OF THE LAWYERS.
THE Bench and the Bar may be said to be at present on their annual
Continental circuit, and in the majority of legal motions, the venue is
laid in Italy, France, or Switzerland. Several judges may be found
sitting in banco under the verandabs of Italian hotels, and various
members of the Bar are asking in vain for a rule to show cause, why
there should not be an order to tax the bill of some exorbitant Swiss
landlord. Our learned friend, BRIEFLEss, has converted his blue º:
into a sac de nuit, and was much hurt at being asked at the Frenc
custom-house, if he had “nothing to declare,” which he regarded as a
satirical allusion to his not having much to do in the way of drawing
declarations. When we last § of him he had just attained a §:
considerable eminence—geographically speaking-and was looking bac
on the Jura Mountains, which he had just crossed, when with excusable
emotion, he burst into a strain of eloquence, characteristically com-

THE LITERATURE OF THE TOLLET.
ON reading the subjoined extract from Le Follet, some people will be
inclined to think that the journal so called deserves its name:-
“The month of September is an epoch in fashion, and also in the customs of the
beau monde. In September we must begin to renounce the zephyr dresses of summer
—the grenadines, the muslins—those light materials we have worn with so much
pleasure—for taffetas d'Italie, moires; in a word, for tissues more solid and comfortable.”
Our finical contemporary talks, in a tone of regret, of renouncin
the grenadines and muslins which it, and the ladies, “have worn wit
so much pleasure,” although it says that they are going to “renounce”
these tissues for others which are more comfortable, and which they
will, therefore, have still greater pleasure in wearing. Of course, the
fair readers of the Follet do not prefer elegance to comfort. Surely they
cannot derive the vivid pleasure it alludes to from the mere circumstance
of being decorated with the specified tissues, with which they adorn
...” not for their own gratification, but for the delight of their
enoiders.
Sphere of Usefulness for Lords Spiritual.
IT appears that a visitor to the British Museum cannot be permitted
to see the Library there without an order, to be obtained only by appli-
cation to the ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY, the Bishop of LoNDON,
or some one or other of the directors. Considering the incomes which
the above-named prelates enjoy for doing a by no means Fº
amount of service, not to say work, would it not be as well if they were
to take turns of attending at the Museum, Library door to examine
applicants for admission as to their moral fitness for the privilege, and
to pass the duly qualified in? -

THE BOSTON BABY SHOW.
After TENNYsoN.
I went to our Gardens, CLAUDE, when the Boston babies were shown;
I went to our Gardens, CLAUDE, to criticise beauty and bone;
And my cheerless bachelor lot I abhorr'd, and long’d to have one of
my own.
The Royal Harmonics I heard on the flute, violin, bassoon;
Each gay little Mammy-boy coo’d like a bird, while its Mammy humm'd

Each infant to nourishment never demurr'd, with cheeks like a harvest

Mothers and nurses a hundred and one, with their charges, sat in array
But, Mº º JACKSON reign'd not alone as the *Priºriest Girº

Full hº § voters bow’d at her throne, while half to her charms
said “ ay,”
For the heart from a stone or the veriest croné ELLEN BRIDGEMAN
would steal away.
Then I said to Joe MAweR, “Now JoE—here goes, I'll bet you a

From the ºf: of his nose to the tip of his toes, he's the ‘FINEs.T

THE RESULT :
WANTED, THE “WAN.”
THE Betting-House scoundrels are making another attempt, upon
the forbearance of the police. They are working a system of “lists,”
which, according to the Sunday Times, is a change of the old system, in
one respect only. Money is still staked, but no tickets are produced—
except, we suppose, the tickets-of-leave, which are carried by most of
the betting-house fraternity. The Sunday Times reluctantly warns its
friends that “an open transgression of the law cannot in any case be
defended.”. Having preluded, in a wonderful sentence which we dare
not pretend to disentangle, that “however oppressive and unjust may
be the restraints which legislators in their wisdom may place upon the
liberty of the subject, however unpopular may be their enactments and
inquisitorial their statutes, that love of order and respect ºf the law,
which are supposed to be inbred and involuntary among Englishmen
ensures, their obedience, because it is known that they will be carrie
out with vigour,” the journal advises “circumspection,” for “however
unpleasant the fact may sound to ears polite, they (the ears) are under
the eye of the *.
| We should like to see a policeman with polite ears under his eye,
especially as it appears to be his duty to carry out Englishmen with
vigour-carry them out of the betting houses, we suppose. But if
nothing worse than eccentric grammar were in question, we should not
presume to interfere—a journalist knows what kind of composition is
|acceptable to the class he addresses. We, however, protest against
|any kind of expressed or implied toleration being extended, by any
|portion of the press, to the betting scoundrels, upon whom we trust

ANDER CockBURN's admirable Act, the duty of watching the rascals
º be expeditiously transferred to the keepers of HER MAJESTY's
gaOIS.
QUEER OBJECTS OF CHARITY.
THE Widows and Orphans of the Clergy can hardly be the sort of
eople they are generally º: the following remarks of the
orning Post, commenting on the “Festival of the Three Choirs,” are
correct:-
“Most proper it is that there should be a fund for the Widows and Orphans of
Clergymen, but is it not a roundabout way of raising it to spend £2,658 in pleasure in
order to give £900 in charity? Does it not show that, after all, the real object is not
appreciated? Would not nearly the same people have gone to the same festival had
the collection been for a totally opposite object—say, for the prevention of cruelty to
animals, or the promotion of teetotalism.”
Perhaps they would; but are not the prevention of cruelty to animals
and the promotion of teetotalism objects more especially, opposite to
the sale of spirituous liquors and the amusement of dog fighting than
to the sustenance and relief of Clergymen's Widows and Orphans? Is
there any opposition between the Widows' and Orphans' benefit and
the cause of temperance and humanity? Are the relicts and fatherless
children of the Clergy particularly given to gin and ratting? Surely
our aristocratic contemporary could not have said a severer thing of
the abandoned wives and children of the mobility.
TESTIMONIALS WANTED.
THE sound men and true of Sheffield are about to embody their
admiration of their out-speaking member, ARTHUR Roebuck, in a
Testimonial. We are glad of it. Were they to bestow upon him
another Koh-i-moor, it would only typify, in its unflawed purity, the
high integrity of the senator and the man.
ut this is the vacation, and are there not other members of Parlia:
ment with claims to testimonials, very significant of their services and
merits? Shall nothing be bestowed upon MR GLADstone, in comme-
moration of his oratorical aid to Russia? Old REGIoMontanus once
made a fly, so exquisitely constructed that it would use its .# make
circles, and buzz. ...Why should not Oxford offer a premium for a me-
chanical spider, with eight diamond eyes, the spider always carrying
eight that, politician-like, he may keep a sharp look-out for all sides;
a spider that will spin the finest gossamer, every line of film nicely
balancing the other? Or, if this mechanical achievement be impossible,
why not present to the Ex-CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer a full-
grown chameleon?—a logician, poetically, said to live on air, and a
politician by no means warranted of fast colours? .
As it is very probable that MR. John BRIGHT is at Rhyl, North
Wales, and as he must, on the early, fall of Sebastopol, write another
letter from the sea-side to Manchester, in condemnation of the
wickedness of the bombardment, we think a bran new pen from the
wing of a Russian eagle could not fail to assist him, even in his best
moments of inspiration.
A CoRRespondent wants to know, whether, considering the great
utility of the ocean, poets are not wrong to call it “a waste of water!”

ALEXANDER'S MASKED BALL.
THE CzAR is said to have commanded a series of mas-
querades, in order to recruit the spirits of his subjects, by
way of compensation for the recruits which they are daily
compelled to afford his army. We have not been furnished
with a programme of any one of the entertainments; but
We º: that the celebrated Dance of Death, arranged
upon the model of Hol.BEIN’s work, would be a principal
feature of them. The masquerade, to be complete and
characteristic, should include a masked battery, which,
- Majesty's own people. A. Flag of Truce Dance should be
composed for the occasion, to be performed by Dol-
GoRouski and GoRTschakoff, with all the flower of Russian
chivalry, in the character and costume of Ojibbeway Indians.
These masquerades will not deceive Europe. Russia threw
off the mask when she invaded the Principalities, and will
get no good by resuming it now.
PROCRASTINATION.—It is with our good intentions as with

“THAT FELL SERJEANT,” ADAMS I
A GREAT compliment has, all unwillingly, all unconsciously, been paid
to the undaunted, unbending integrity of SERJEANT ADAMs. To be
sure, the eulogist does not hold a very high position in the world: and
—the pillory being abolished—may never achieve the elevation that, in
other times, might have rewarded him. In a word, John JAcOBs, the
eulogist of the Serjeant is, in the stern English of the police-reporter,
“a well-known Jew thief and burglar.”, Nevertheless, even a Jew thief
may be capable of fine ºp. of character, and truth—to his own
astonishment—may break out from the lips of a burglar.
MR. INGHAM, the magistrate, proposed to send JoHN JAcoBs to
Clerkenwell to be tried."jogs jačois had strong objections to such a
movement. The earnest, burglar observed, “I would rather not go
before SERJEANT ADAMs.” e repeated his objection; and at last
emphatically declared, that “old AMs would convict his own
mother.”
Surely “this is more than Greek, and more than Roman fame !” We
have had BRUTUs condemning his own son; and we know—especially
at college—how very stoically sons do sometimes sacrifice their own
fathers; but for a Serjeant to suppress within him all filial risings, to
put down the hysterica passio, and convict his maternal parent, is the
very martyrdom of duty!
We earnestly propose the subject to Academician WARD. It would
make a fine fresco, and would be an illustrative and enduring memorial
of the judicial inflexibility of SERJEANT ADAMs as avouched by burglar
JAcobs. We, leave the treatment of the subject in the hands of the
ºl. merely stipulating for the introduction, in some corner, of
Acobs himself, looking straight at the Serjeant—straight as the crow-
bar flies. This is due to the thief and housebreaker as the proposer of
the subject. We are all familiar with the picture—Chief Justice
flºp. commits the Prince of Wales; but how poor the theme to
that of Mr. Serjeant Adams convicts his own Mother; MR. John HUM-
PHREYs PARRY, with all his horse-hair on end, vainly striving to move

“THEN MUST THE JEW BE MERCIFUL.”
THE “cruel Jew” was an old phrase, dear to persecutors, but one
did not expect to find it justified in the present day. It appears, how-
ever, that the Animals' Friend Society have discovered that the mode
in which the Jews put to death the creatures they eat is especially bar-
barous, and the law is invoked to put a stop to the system, under which
it is alleged that a poor ox is a quarter of an hour in dying. Time has
been given to the Jews to get up their defence, their advocate intimating
that “their religious liberties might be involved in the question.” We
trust it will be found that they are not, and that a Jew may be as free
as possible, without the necessity of his torturing beasts to show his
liberty. ...Anyhow, such practices must be abandoned, the rabbi must
be merciful to the rabbit, and however little else a Jew may stick at,
he must stick at a sheep with humane promptitude.

Sadly Flippant.
A LOCAL newspaper says,
“A marriage was solemnised at Darton on Monday, which excited much interest in
that locality. In the procession were seven asses, gaily decked out.”
A heartless, and disrespectful wretch, whom Mr. Punch instantly
kicked out of his office, remarked, on reading the paragraph, “What a
fuss to make about five more than ordinary.”
Our Foreign Relations.
ENGLAND and France have turned pawnbrokers in favour of Turkey,

AN UNWARRANTABLE AFFAIR.
CAN this be true?
“We have now found out that Policeman Hicks, of Roydon, had no
warrant or summons when he took us before Ma. HEMwing, on
Thursday the 9th of August; we thought that the piece of paper which
he produced at the time was one. But in consequence *::: state-
ments which appeared in the newspapers, the chief constable for the
county of Essex, CAPTAIN M'Haany, sent to the superintendent of
lice at Epping, MR. Godwin, on Saturday, the 25th of August, to
now if there was a warrant issued for Policeman Hicks to take us
before the Rev. MR HEMMINo on the 9th of August, when he, Ma.
Godwin, went to the Rev. Ma. HEMMng at Parndon, on Sunday the 26th
of August, and got from him a warrant, dated the 7th of August,
which he sent to Chelmsford to CAPTAIN M'Haady, thereby deceiving
him, and making him believe that all was done regularly, which turns
out now not to have been the case.”
... The above is the statement of Thomas Collin. Surely
it is not understood rightly if it appear to represent MR.
HEMMING as making out a warrant on the 26th August
and dating it on the 7th, in order to assist the superin-
tendent of police in deceiving his chief. We know that
MR., HEMMING committed the Collins; nevertheless, we
should think he would have been afraid to commit a

majority of our female friends and relatives; but that of as many yards in as many days,
an amount of walking exercise in the open air, which is not exceeded by a great many of them,--
is hardly far enough. For, in that case, the blood stagnates, and is insufficiently ačrated;
hence, headache and all manner of poorliness, besides, the more disagreeable, consequence
of loss of blooming complexion. This dreadful misfortune is aggravated by discolorations,
may, eruptions; in fact, not to mince the mat-
ter, breakings-out and pimples, consequent on
inaction of the skin. The muscles lose their tone
from disuse; and the figure, no longer braced by
their action, bulges and falls away; besides
which, it often becomes deformed by the calamity
of fat. The ligaments of the joints relax from the
same cause, the ankles thicken and swell, and, the
tarsal arch giving way, the feet, spread out, and
expand into slabs, in form and dimensions resem-
bling fire-shovels and flat-irons.

A BISEIOP MADE EASY.
It is proposed to split, the see of Exeter into
halves and make a new bishopric of one of them
under the name of Cornwall. The Bishop of
ExETER consents to the partition, which may
seem wonderful; but the endowment of the new
see is to be provided by the liberality of the
Rev. DR. WALKER, and it is not designed to
divide the income as well as the diocese. Dr.
WALKER is the rector and patron of St. Columb
Major, of which benefice, worth £1,600 a-year,
he offers to resign the incumbency and advowson,
giving up his own living to supply the Bishop
of CoRNWALL with a maintenance. He is pre-
exploit; “a femi- hº also to give the Bishop a house fi. for
No. him, and two other houses, for canons. Thus
DR, WALKER precludes a pun that might other-
wise be committed against episcopal extension,
in the shape of an objection that we are too
much in want just now of mortars and Lancaster
É. to be able to think of affording more
ishops and canons.
INSCRIPTION FoR A GERMAN BED-"Good
Stabling for Nightmares.”
THE CANT OF SQUARETOES.
The Liverpool Standard, in replying to the question, “Where are our
great men P” observes that—
“If our great men are asked for, the inquirer is referred to the names of FARADAY,
STEPHExson, BRUNEL, and other masters of science; the materialism of hard facts
having totally superseded the imaginative faculties, and wisdom given place to mere
human knowledge."
When, since the Britons wore coats of paint, and no pantaloons of
any other material, did the superhuman wisdom, of which our Liverpool
contemporary speaks, exist in these islands P. We can think of no
example of the wisdom of our ancestors more nearly divine than that of
the celebrated dramatic author to whom our Allies apply the epithet in
question, under the name of WILLIAMs; meaning SHAKSPEARE. At
present Šºkstrºng has º more readers than he ever had, so
that his wisdom, at least, has not given place to any inferior description
of knowledge. , We do not get a SHAKsięARE, as we do not kill a pig,
every day; and the same remark, with still more propriety, perhaps, in
the opinion of many, may be applied to BACON. Now, BAcoN's philo-
sophy is precisely the basis on which modern science is cultivated, and
by proceeding thereon such men as FARADAY discover facts instead of
imagining fallacies; but is it not a considerable advantage that the
materialism of facts, whether hard or otherwise, has thus superseded
the softer unreality of the imaginative faculties?
To attempt the search of truth by the imagination, instead of
the perceptive and reasoning powers, is rather characteristic of a
reat fool than a great man. hat the old Eldonite writer in the
- ol Standard probably means in complaining that the present age
is deficient in great men is, that there are few minds among us which
predominate over the f. mind; but this circumstance may be
owing not so much to the scarcity of great men, as to the circumstance
that solemn prosers and pompous mouthers do not now make that im:
pression ºn the public which they made in the good old times, and
sºil. perhaps, if they had any scope for their genius, make upon

The Manchester Bells.
WE read with satisfaction that on the arrival of the news of the Fall
of Sebastopol peals of bells were rung from the Churches of Manchester.
The Manchester School, bell, however, was tolled by the Manchester
scholars in a slow and solemn manner, sounding a knell,
A SERGEANT'S SILK HANDKERCHIEF.
THERE lives in the little jºf of Brentwood, a sergeant retired
from the 7th Fusileers, by name Thomas EveRETT, illustrated in the
Crimean War with five wounds, and the loss of one eye. A mighty
hunter of Russians was Thomas EveRETT ; having, it is said, bagged
fifty of the children of the CzAR,-the miserable little ones' At the
Almaa shot whistled through THOMAS EVERETT's ear, whispering danger
private and confidential. A bayonet went through his arm in a sortie;
and, by way of Nº. Thomas EveRETT enjoyed a ball on the same
evening through the hip. ...A cannon-shot made so near an acquaintance
with one of his feet, that it delicately removed the sole of a shoe. Two
of his comrades were taken into Sebastopol, prisoners, but Thomas
EveRETT stole into the city at º: shot the sentry who guarded
them, and returned with his rescued friends. Great, heroic have been
the deeds of THOMAs EveRETT; and great, magnificent has been his
reward, for—but the theme calls for a new paragraph.

The Bane and the Antidote,
It seems, after all, that the greatest adulteration of milk is with
water. But it is a question, with what kind of water? If it is with
Thames' water, there cannot well be a worse kind of adulteration, against
which chalk itself would be a thousand times preferable. In fact, the
chalk should be prudently reserved as an antidote against, the bane of
drinking, the Thames' water, for we all know that Chalk Mixture is
repeatedly administered in violent cases of cholera.

MANCHESTER IN PARIS.
WE rejoice to find that Manchester flaunts and flourishes in the
French exhibition. The Times’ correspondent does all honour to the
fineness, the delicacy of the drills—so fine that even the EMPEROR
#". of them, so delicate that the EMPREss became a purchaser.
e further learn that Manchester's agent, MR, MURRAY, in the
blandest manner informed His MAJESTY that these drills, notwithstand-
ing “the prohibitory tariff, found their way into the French market;
the cost of smuggling varying from 50 to 100 per cent.” At this
guileless avowal, His Esty merely observed, “It was a good thing
to know.” And as far as the benign effects of the smuggler may
operate, Mr. Punch will add, “a º .# to do;” for the smuggler
may, in a sort, be considere º lic benefactor: a citizen of the world
that circulates the world's good gifts. There were several LUTHERs
before the successful one, says a philosophic historian. There were
many WILL WATCHEs before RICHARD CoBDEN.
The name of CoRDEN brings us to BRIGHT, with whose house the
Times' exhibition critic is very wrath, The subject is carpets—carpets
which are exhibited by BRIGHT AND Co. The savage critic declares,-
“These carpets are execrable in design, though remarkable in other respects; and
for the sake of British taste, which the Manchester manufacturers appear to glory in
doing all they can to vulgarise, we could have wished that the gold medal said to have
been awarded in this instance had been withheld, on the special ground that it is a high
industrial offence to use the multiplying powers of machinery for the purpose of
debasing in any country the appreciation of the beautiful.”
These be bitter words: but we believe John BRIGHT AND Co. may
lead this much in extenuation: the carpets were not intended for
rance, but were originally manufactured for Russia; the unsophisti-
cated children of the CZAR, like all children of nature, having a passion
for the strongest conflict of colours. That Manchester delights to
debase the appreciation of the beautiful can hardly be true, seeing how
it at once appreciates and elevates JoHN BRIGHT, a very pattern-man,
though it would seem not quite the man of carpet-patterns.
We have, however, heard a trade report that, if true, will go very
far to enhance the reputation of John BRIGHT as a fancy carpet-weaver.
Qur readers are, of course,'familiar with pocket-handkerchiefs on which
the whole text of documents—poetic or patriotic—are printed. Well,
JoHN BRIGHT is about to produce for the Russian market—the goods
will go through Prussia—certain carpets with his own speeches in con-
demnation of the Russian war, and in praise of Russia, printed, to the
last letter, in the very best Russian,—the translation having been
obtained by means of a certain Greek merchant located in Manchester,
who every day drinks, in the choicest Samian wine, confusion to the
Allies by sea and land! -
There can be no doubt that these goods will, find a ready sale
throughout holy Russia. , Most fittingly, too, will the speeches of
MR. BRIGHT betransferred to carpets, for such specimens of Manchester
logic and Manchester patriotism cannot be too often or too much
trodden under foot.
RUSSIAN RECEPTION OF THE NEWS OF THE
FAILL OF SEBASTOPOL.

CzAR ALEXANDER, ground his teeth, and tore the letter to pieces.
The KING OF PRUssIA was seized with a vertigo. T. When he
recovered he expressed himself very unwell, and called for brandy and

The heart of Britain heaveth with an universal gladness,
From the Land's End to the Orkneys, from the Wash to Arran-more :
The voice of Britain cleaveth the air in jubilant madness,
And the clashing of her steeples,
And the shouting of her peoples,
Bear a burden to the cannon as #. roar!
"Twill be § for tears to-morrow, o'er their names that conquering

But now let those who mourn for their loved ones stricken down
Like Spartans hide their sorrow, in the thought that those they cherish'd

Their country's banner o'er them,
And hands clench'd in death upon the crown.
We knew they would not failus-that flower of four brave nations—
Though the struggle might be stubborn and the conquestdearlybought:
Coward doubtings might assail us, and petulant impatience,
But we knew that no contriving
When Wrong and Right were striving,
Could bring GoD's rule of justice unto nought.
All through the winter dreary, when the clouds were at their blackest,
We felt the sun behind them-soon in radiance to appear:
When inaction seem'd most weary, and progress at its slackest,
With heart and hope unbated,
The tidings we awaited,
That at length burst on Europe's listening ear.
Sebastopol is taken spread the news till it engender
A fear in all enslavers, a hope in all (mslayed:
Till the CzAR's proud heart be shaken, in his terror-haunted splendour,
And he own the wrath of Heaven,

Sebastopol is taken! as the scorpion i. by embers
Deals death upon itself with suicidal sting,
So Moscow’s blazing beacon the Muscovite remembers,
And in ruin lays the city,
While his wounded scream for pity,
As the fire round them draws its hungry ring.
Sebastopol is taken! its stored accumulations
For long-plann’d schemes of conquest in the air are idly hurl’d,
Or blaze, or stand forsaken for the victorious nations,
To break them or to burn them,
Or to noble uses turn them,
For the freeing, not the fettering, of the world.

Guarded arsenal and harbour and war-ships, frown no more;
Red tongues of fire unslaken the bastions environ,
Whose glare º: victors gazing,
On Russian hulls a-blazing
And her army to the northward pouring o'er.
Sebastopol is taken! But the work is not completed,
While a foot of the Crimea the CzAR dares call his own;
While a race with heart to waken under Russian rule is seated:
While Georgia Russian wrong holds,
And the Baltic has its strongholds,
Where the double-headed vulture sits in stone.
Sebastopol is taken! Peace is the cry already
From those who cried that cry, 'ere War's flag was well unfurl’d;
“No Peace”—say we. The Kraken, though stunn’d, yet welters, ready
With force or subtle suction,

SIMPLETONS WHO MAKE SOTS.
At a meeting of busybodies, which took place
last Monday week, at St. Martin's Hall, various
resolutions were agreed to, one of them being to
the effect:-
“That, as it had been proved that much drunkenness took
place on º night and on the evenings of Sunday, it
was important that petitions numerously signed should be
prepared for presentation early in the next session of Parlia-
ment, praying that public houses and beershops might be
closed at 10 o'clock on Saturday night, and remain closed
the whole of Sunday in every part of the United Kingdom;
and that strenuous exertions should be made to reduce, as
speedily as possible, the number of pullic houses, with a
view to their utter extinction so far as the sale of intoxi-
cating liquors were concerned."
These meddlesome persons constituted what is
called the “Temperance Conference,” and many
of them were members of an impertinent body
calling itself the “London Temperance League.”
We suspect that some large capitalists in the
wine trade are at the back of these “Tempe-
rance Leagues" and “Conferences,” the re.
sult of whose frantic ravings and insane resolu-
tions must be to produce a re-action against
that moderate use of fermented liquors, which
has been of late years gaining ground, and thus
to occasion a greatly increased abuse of those
fluids. The sanctimony of the Puritans was one
of the principal causes of the dissoluteness of
the Cavaliers, and the fanaticism of the teetotal
quacks and maniacs will, in a corresponding
measure, tend to the promotion of drunkenness.

Čºlijtreas the Harvest of 1855 was being got in under
the most favourable circumstances, and in the most
delightful weather; and whereas while such Harvest
was being got in, certain parties malevolently announced
the opening of Vauxhall Gardens, whereby Rain, as was
natural and habitual, instantly descended, and the
weather became cold and raw:

A COUPLE OF WONDERS.
The RE are always two money-questions, which puzzle people more
than any other social question, including even the celebrated question
repeated de die in diem, of “ What shalf we have for dinner to-day?’
These questions assume the form of riddles that are constantly being
asked, but to which we never recollect hearing an answer. Scarcely a
day passes, but what you hear, the question applied to some one you
know. Every one present, takes it up, repeats it in nearly the same
form, until at last the whole society loses itself in a labyrinth of
absurd surmises, out of which they are only conducted by the thread
of the next discourse.
These money-questions are:–

difficulty were solved, for the riddles once guessed, there would be an
end for ever to the amusement.
There are some friends who are worse even than the Income-Tax
Commissioners. Not satisfied with knowing the amount of your income,
and from what particular sources you draw it, they would also wish to
know how you spend it. What a pity these meddlesome persons are
not iſ...} to send round papers every quarter with questions relative
to one's income, like the above, drawn out at elaborate length, which
their friends should be compelled, under a heavy penalty to answer,
down to the smallest details, accounting satisfactorily for the outlay of
every penny of their disbursements. Some day, when we have nothin
better to do, we will draw out this new form of income Tax papers, an
give ample instructions as to the precise fines and, penalties to be im.

THE CLERICAL AUCTION MART.
ON Tuesday afternoon, says a paragraph in the Times, MR. ALDER-
MAN FAREBROTHER attended at GARRAway's Coffee-House, for the
purpose of disposing, by public auction, of the advowson and right of
resentation to the rectory of Lytchett Maltrayers, in the county of
orset. After stating various interesting particulars about the living,
the value of which was estimated at £607 a-year, the worthy Alderman
proceeded to inform his congregation that-
“The incumbent was thirty-three years of age, and some representations had been
made as to the state of his health. He (the worthy Alderman) would not say what
those representations were, but intending purchasers might easily satisfy them-
selves on that point.”
The Times' reporter, however, omits to state that the Alderman in

into howls, and yells, and notes of non-admiration, and other, intense
typography, but into the form of an advertisement by a Sheffield Firm,
which proposed to supply the Company with the newest and, most
excruciating appliances for ºf torture. Spasmodic appeals are
usually wasted—Mr. Punch's acid bit even into the brass of Leaden-
hall Street.
The Company's organ shall speak for itself:-
“The Torture question has got into Punch, and we annex to this article an adver-
tisement on the subject, written in his best style of racy and sarcastic humour.”
To this introduction we, have no objection at all. The writer, then
proceeds to say, that the “attack is in the highest degree unjust.” . Of
this, more anon. The Friend, after a brief analysis of the advertise:
ment, which he has the fairness also to quote in full, meets the alleged
injustice, by treating it as an imputation upon the “Company's Ser-
wants,” by which title he states that in England “European civil
officers in the Company's Service” are “exclusively” designated.
Now this, with great respect to the Friend, is something like trifling
with a grave accusation. Mr. Punch is not in the habit of making
charges that are either unjust or ridiculous. Every reader of Punch
knows perfectly well what he meant. Nobody, for a second supposed
that he imputed physical cruelty to one English gentleman engaged in
administering the affairs of India. When was Punch guilty of putting
such insane trash to paper? -
But he did make an imputation, and a pretty strong one, and one
which he has since repeated, and one which he means to repeat until
the last vestige of a reason for it is done away; namely, that Torture is
used in India for the collection of the Company’s Revenue. And as,
since he published the advertisement, the clearest proof of the fact has
been put forth at much length, and with due circumstantiality, by the
Times and other journals, and as the Madras Torture Report, about
to appear in England, will formally register the accusations, Mr. Punch
in nowise regrets that he has called universal attention to the subject.
The yery modes of inflicting the torture are before the world, and
therefore, luckily, it is needless for Mr. Punch to pain his readers by the
recapitulation of such atrocities. When the Honourable East India
Company has done what no doubt every gentleman, either in its
direction or its service, desires should be done, namely, rooted out the
infernal system from every Indian village under British domination, it
will be time enough for its advocates to become indignant with English
journalists. Meantime, it would be well for those advocates not to try
to ride off on a quibble, such rides generally, terminating where the
equestrian performances of mendicity are Fº held to end.
The Torture Commission sat but a short time, but, says the Press, in
|
|
reply to the attempt “to show that the use of Torture in the Company's
territories has been exceptional,” during that short time they received
“1440 letters of complaint of the practice.”
| In presence of this fact, and some hundreds of other facts which have
been and will be made known, Mr. Punch is obliged to intimate to the
Friend of India that, while entirely agreeing with him, that
| “The article in Punch will be read by millions, and it will now become the settled
conviction of the people of England, that the European [no, not Euro , but Asiatic]
servants of the Company are constantly in the º of resorting to most flagitious
modes of torture.”
he cannot concur in the sentiment that
“It is impossible to overrate the mischief which such an article will produce, and the
deep and fatal impression which it cannot fail to create in the national mind;"
for Mr. Punch is ha py to believe, on the contrary, that he will have
largely aided in the #º of a popular feeling which will º
| enforce upon the Honourable Company the necessity of doing away wit
a foul blot upon the Anglo-Indian escutcheon.
SOMETHING ABOUT THE KNOW-NOTHINGS.
“Knowledge is power;” but in America this power consists in the
knowledge mainly of knowing nothing. -
“A little knowledge is a dangerous thing;” consequently, to avoid
all danger, it is far better to know nothing at all.
The old precept, “Know Thyself” is quite wrong,
Nothing, if he carries out strictly the principles of fi,
right even to know himself. -- -
What becomes of State Education, when the great object of life is to
know nothing? only, in England, our many religious sects have for
years past arrived at this happy conclusion; for they are unanimously
resolved, that if a child cannot be educated according to their own
peculiar way of thinking, he shall not be educated at all-in other
words, that he shall be a complete Know-Nothing, and live and die in
that blessed state. -
We wonder if a Know-Nothing ranks as a cipher in the State?. and if
these ciphers are only valuable so far as they help, like other ciphers,
to swell the value of the figure that stands at their head? And again we
wonder, how many of such ciphers it would require before that figure
would be able to make anything like “Political Capital” out of them P
For instance, what would be their political market value to such a
figurative statesman as GLApston Ef and with what justice might he
be quoted, from being the º national º: of the Peelites, as
standing in England at the head of the English Know-Nothings.” .
A Know-Nothing is one who sticks at nothing in order that America
§: “nothing to nobody,” excepting to such as are regular Know-
otnings.
But, perhaps, the Know-Nothings are so called to distinguish them-
selves from the MITCHELLs, and the like in America, who are generally
Good-for-Nothings?
The man, who professes to know everything, is generally proved to
be a know-nothing; but, in general, mistrust the man who meets, an
accusation by ; he “knows nothing,” as it is pretty evident that
he knows something that he is most anxious to conceal, and a great
deal more than he would like to confess.
A real Know-
creed, has no
True Dignity.

English men of science forming part of the English jury; and thereto

A SPLENDID SPECIMEN OF CANT.
We have a contemporary calling itself the Christian Gabinet—a title
which conveys an insinuation against LoRD PALMERSTON's Government.
This journal is addressed to mechanics and labourers, whom it professes
to supply with news of a general character, and articles imbued with
Christian sentiment. A paper, assuming the prefix of Christian, of
course intends thereby to distinguish .# from the rest of the news.
paper-press, the larger portion of which claims, though it does not
arrogate, that epithet. It might be surmised that the Christianity of
such a paper would be something peculiar. Whether that is the case
may perhaps appear from the following taste of its quality:-
Idol. WoRship IN ENGLAND.—To the Editors of the Christian Cabinet-It cannot
be denied that idol worship is greatly on the increase in this country. Let any
thoughtful person go to the British Museum, and observe the earnest gaze of the people
at the hideous idols which have been brought into this country at an enormous expense
to the nation.”
But why not rather ascribe the “earnest gaze” to interest in objects
which illustrate and attest §. than to idolatry? The letter, of
which the above is the charitable and rational commencement, proceeds
in the ensuing language of modesty and humility:-
“Why were those abominations of a wicked nation brought into this land to be a
blot upon its fair escutcheon, and to bring down the wrath of the Almighty upon us, by
war, disease, and taxation?"
The signature attached to this sensible epistle is J. LANE. MRs. LANE
—for the sex of this writer must be female and her age advanced—is a
cool old lady to pretend to a knowledge, which of course must be of a
rophetic nature, that MR. LAYARD's bulls have brought upon us the
ussian war. We expect that J. LANE will shortly give herself out as
the successor of J. Southcote.
Poor old MRs. LANE continues—
"Let the people destroy those idols, and level them with the dust.”
Fair, but anile iconoclast! But how is your advice, GooDY LANE, to
be followed by the people without resistance to the powers that be,
which include policemen, besides the soldiers who mount guard at the
gate of the British Museum? Now, MRs. LANE, you know what is
the penalty in such case made and provided by a higher Court than
even that of Parliament.
m
SCENE ON THE ENGLISH COAST.
Goody LANE then moderates the rancour of her pen; and her next
suggestion is less dangerous, if not much more reasonable.
"Let tables be placed in those magnificent rooms, and cover them with religious
books and papers for the spiritual improvement, daily, of the people.”
There is one thing to be said in favour of this, proposal. The rooms
certainly would not be overcrowded, and it Wºlf be possible for the
frequenters of these religious reading rooms to pursue their studies
without the slightest mutual interruption. But we are afraid that this
plan would involve the presentation of the sack to SIGNOR PANIzzi.
We do not know what are the views of that gentleman as to the religious
character of literature, but apprehend that they would at least #.
from those of MRs. LANE... On that question the Public, moreover,
would entertain some diversity of opinion.
MRs. LANE adds the following piece of advice:–
* Let a large organ be placed in the rooms, that the people may hear solemn music,
at least once a-week.”
But the people can do that already. At St. Paul's and Westminster
Abbey there is an anthem and º º: Besides, there is
very solemn music in Le Prophète, which they have frequent oppor-
tunities of hearing, also in Robert le Diable. There is some deeply solemn
music in the Zauberflöte: and the opening of the overture to
Freischütz is marvellously solemn. But Mrs. LANE, we suppose, dis-
approves of the theatre, and disapproves equally of cathedrals.
§. LANE's last recommendation is, that | Christians should pra
for peace. Very proper. We trust, too, that she will in future §
her own. By printing that venerable lady's letter the Christian Cabinet
appears to participate in her sentiments on the subject of sculpture.
But then it ought to #. itself the Mahonetan Cabinet rather than the
Christian-save that all enlightened Turks have by this time outgrown
the old fanaticism of Islam in regard to imitative art.
Wiseman and St. Winifred.
ONCE upon a time, JAMES THE SECOND turned aside from a progress
to visit the well of ST. WINIFRED, in order to supplicate the Saint to
bless him with an heir to the English throne. A few days ago, Doctor
WISEMAN, it is said, not only visited ST. WINIFRED's waters, but bathed
in them! Is the Pope in want of another son to the “true” Church?

PUNCH'S ILLUSTRATIONS TO SHAKSPEARE,

Winter's Tale, Act iii., Scene 2.
LORD BROUGHAM MADE A WALUABLE
CONSIDERATION.
AN advertisement in Galignani announces for sale a
château in the South of France, which, among its other
attractions, is said to be “adorned with the Cactus,” to
be “within forty-four to fifty hours of London,” and “ only
five minutes' walk from the residence of Lord BRough AM.”
To the amateurs of the Cactus the inducement above held
forth is legitimate enough, and it is reasonable to intimate
that the château is within forty-four or fifty hours of
London; but the propinquity to Lord BRough AM is a
matter which no speculator has any right to take advantage
of. We do not imagine that it is with Lord BRough AM's
consent that he is thus introduced into an advertisement
as a means of enhancing the attractions of a château for
sale in his neighbourhood. . It is of course a merely
nominal advantage to be within five minutes' walk of Lord
BROUGHAM, unless the privilege of dropping in upon that
accomplished nobleman is to be included in the purchase.
Unless Lok D BRough AM becomes a party to the con-
veyance, and agrees to a clause, in º he undertakes to
be at home when the purchaser dropsin, we do not see how
the fact of !". will add to the value of the premises.
We think it would be only fair that Lord Brough AM
should have a portion of the purchase-money in consideration
of its amount being increased by the announcement that
his Lordship is within five minutes' walk of the property.
If the advertisement had appeared during the session, we
should have expected a motion to have been made in the
House of Lords on the subject.

THE POPE has lately been engaged spiritually in the sort
of work that other European powers are doing in a
material sense. He has been letting off his artillery, par-
ticularly at Spain, and our Allies, the Sardinians. The
ordnance of his Holiness is, however, of a small descrip-
tion, and makes but little noise; in fact, it is an almost
childish species of artillery, consisting of mere Pope-guns.
l
CAPTIVITY AMONG THE NATIVES OF RUSSIA.
WHAT can you expect from a bear but brutality?—but contrary to
expectation, it seemed that the Russians had treated some officers of
ours, who had fallen into their hands, humanely. A different story, how-
ever, is-told by the Paris correspondent of the Morning Post, who says–
“I have spoken to a gentleman who has just arrived in Paris from Constantinople.
A number of English exchanged prisoners had just reached the latter city, half dead:
They had been subjected to the nostinsolent and humiliating treatment by the Russians
whilst marching. One officer told my friend that he had been marched more than
1000 miles on foot, with nothing to eat but black bread and dirty water. When the
party arrived at certain villages on their way, he was made to walk two or three times
through the place, to be shown to the people, and was insulted and spat upon. The
guard gave him dirty water to drink when clean was at hand, and, throughout the
march, sought to annoy him in every way. I hope this gentleman, who is now ill at
Constantinople, will make his case known, for I am assured it is no exceptional one.
The Russians are taught particularly to insult the English, it appears."
The writer then makes the very natural remark, that the Muscovite
risoners in France and England are treated too well. But France and
ngland cannot stoop to retaliation. They do not scalp captive
warriors because those warriors have scalped French and English
captives. The worst we could possibly allow ourselves to do to the
Russian prisoners would be to send them back to Russia. But then
we must keep them, in order to exchange them for the men whom we
have had taken." The longer they remain among us the more thoroughly
they become imbued with j and the greater service they do
us as live bombs when they come to be thrown back upon the CzAR.
An Act of Dotage.
THE Times one day last week presented its readers with an uncom-
monly absurd case of “conscience-money:”—
“The CHANCELLoR of Thrs Exchequk R acknowledges the receipt of the first half of
a Bank of England £100 note, from ‘F.G.Y.,' on account of undemanded Income Tax.”
Of course, F—G-Y can only stand for Fogy.
WOL. XXIX.
THE TEETOTALLERS WANTED.
THE attention of the Universal Sackcloth and Cinder Sunday Society
is ... called to a flagitious ceremony too frequently acted in
HER MAJESTY's Dockyards. A few days since, Miss GoRoon stood
godmother to a new ship, naming it the Pearl. We are told that—
“Having taken a very brief survey of the Ship, Commodone Shephead placed the
garlanded bottle of wine in Miss Gondon's hands, which she immediately dashed against
the cutwater, exclaiming, “Success to the Pearl.'”
What can be expected of a Pearlso christened, but that, as in the
case with pearls in general, it should at some time be found at the
bottom of the sea? Why cannot HER MAJESTY's ships be baptised
with the pure lymph; or, for at least, a season, is it allowed that the
Lords of the Admiralty have cast sufficient cold water on the true in-
terests of the navy f What a moral is conveyed in the garlanded bottle !
Innocent roses, with the wine “biting like a serpent” under them!
We recommend this thought to...MR. Gough, to be duly made up with
his other flowers of rhetoric. We have, moreover, to call the attention
of the above Sackcloth Sunday Society to the fact that, under the
auspices of PRINCE ALBERT, whiskey was drunk about the bonfire
lighted at Balmoral, in commemoration of the tumble down of Sebas-
topol. Of what use, it º be asked, is the moral influence of For BEs
MACKENZIE in Scotland, if the good man is thus to be outraged by the
sad example and mischievous patronage of a PRINCE Consort P
“Cooking” a Barometer.
GREEK merchants of Liverpool in the interest of Russia, have been
accused of an attempt to depress the corn-market, by tampering with
the quicksilver of the Exchange barometer. They have protested
against the imputation, signing three names; they are GLADston IADI;
RAHAMILIzzi; and RºssELLAYANNI. A brass bar, now protects the
barometer from all meddlers: the quality of the metal suggested by the
impudence of the offenders.

appellation has been made the subject of that familiarity which is said to lead to contempt,
through the medium of advertisements. We should scarcely be surprised if the pious puffers
of Doctor CUMMING's books were to take advantage of the popularity of the present
connection between the name of CUMMING and the King of Beasts, and were to send forth
a list, of his works with the words, “DR. CUMMING, THE GREAT RELIGIOUs Lion of THE
DAY.” by way of an attractive heading.
While we are on the subject of pious puffs, we may as well remonstrate against a paragraph
in which one DoctoR CLose, the idol of the old i
with the interesting accessory of a bad leg, or something of the sort,
we lately met with
has been introduced
SOME VERY ODD FISH.
AMONG the pranks performed by the animal creation in what is called
the “dead season” by the penny-a-liners, we have met with nothing
richer than the conduct of a certain cod-fish, who, if newspaper para-
graphs may be believed, has recently indulged in the eccentricity of
swallowing a kitten. This feat appears to have been performed in a fit
of jealousy at the alleged achievement of a ling, who, according to a
Scotch paper, had º devoured the leg of a rabbit. Of course
nobody will inquire very closely how the rabbit lost his leg, or whether
the ling was at once the amputator and the devourer of the unlucky
limb; nor will any one be too curious to ascertain which way the cat
could possibly have jumped to have found its way down the throat of a
cod-fish. If these stories of lings, swallowing rabbits’ legs and cods
bolting entire cats are believed by the readers of a newspaper, it might
certainly give a portrait of one of its subscribers as that of an animal
that can swallow anything.
CURE FOR HOT COPPERS.
A cuRE for the complaint commonly called hot coppers would be a
great boon to a no small proportion of HER Esty's subjects, who
occasionally exceed in strong potations. If their coppers want cleaning,
let them eat some street-oysters, and wash those molluscs down with
street-vinegar. That fluid, in some cases, consists, according to a state-
ment made by DR. HAssaLL at the late meeting of the Association for
the Advancement of Science, of little else than sulphuric acid and water,
coloured with burnt sugar. Sulphuric acid and water are dilute oil of
yitriol, which, as most people know, is the proper thing to scour copper-
kettles with. Indulgence, therefore, in street-oysters is very likely to
cleanse, and, if repeated often enough, effectually to cool hot coppers;
so effectualſ , that the coppers will be rendered incapable of being
heated any more. .

We have already
called attention to the
lamentable case of
poor dear Doctor
CUMMING, who has
been so bespattered,
and be-
daubed with book-
sellers’ puffery, that
we naturally begin to
look for a list of his
works in that portion
of a newspaper which
is devoted to medical
and miscellaneous
quackery. Some of
our friends have be-
come so thoroughly
possessed with the
idea of a connection
between the name of
CUMMING and news-
paper notoriety, that
we have been seriously
same CUMMING whose
for which he has been taking a trip somewhere
on the Continent. The newspaper puff in-
forms us that his leg is getting better, and
that his “ le” at Cheltenham will soon
have him º: and that he , thinks of his
“lambs,” or some twaddle or other, which will,
of course, go the round of all the Cheltenham
tea-tables. If Doctor CLose's anile admirers
like to be called his “people,” we see no objection
to the title; but when we recollect that the
Doctor was one of those who wrote a book to
prove the Satanic agency of Table-turning and
Špirit-rapping, we think that a better term than
“lambs” might be found for those who accept
the Reverend gent as their guide; and we
should be disposed, in selecting a word from the
animal creation, to describe them as Doctor
CLose’s Donkeys.
The over-sanctimonious, and not over-chari-
table portion of the public, will believe, or rather
will assert without believing it, that we intend to
sneer at Religion or its ministers, because we
denounce the quackery and puffery which make
the latter contemptible. It is, however, obvious
to common sense, that the clerical profession is
only degraded by the unwholesome pandering
to personal vanity, to which it is in these days
so much exposed, and which has placed a “popu-
lar preacher” and a “popular performer” in
much the same position. We simply wish to
put down that morbid and usually feminine feel-
ing with reference to parsons which developes
itself in working slippers and antimacassars, or
in giving silver tea-pots to unmarried clergymen.
We recollect an instance in which a bachelor
divine had been presented with so, many em-
broidered shoes and tea services by the spinsters
of his flock, that he might have started with a
capital stock as either a slipper-dealer or a silver-
smith; but happening to marry a lady out of the
parish, he was nearly torn to pieces by his fair
adorers, who called on him to return all the
late that had been presented to him for his
s of Cheltenham, - - -
achelor piety—his single blessedness.
AN ACQUISITION TO PLAIN ENGLISH.
The writer of Notes and Sketches in the Morning Post makes the
following remark, among others of a more judicious character, on the
subject of “Discourse.”
“To say that some point has been excluded, or left out of the question, is much better
than to say it has been ignored.”
If conciseness is desirable in expression, “ignored” is better than
“left out of the question; ” besides, the word means more than that
phrase, and than the term “excluded.” To ignore is wilfully, and
cunningly, and deceitfully to leave out of the question; fraudulently to
overlook; mendaciously to affect not to know; to blink; to pretend
ignorance of a fact that the fact may pass unnoticed, and not be taken
into account. It is a word which describes, with beautiful precision, a
thing very common both in the writings and the conversation of zealots
and bigots, and especially of solemn ecclesiastical humbugs; it com:
pendiously expresses one of their artifices; it neatly bottles off a puff
of their smoke; therefore they don't like it; but therefore it is a lovely
word, and well deserving of incorporation with the QUEEN's English.
A WASHED DUKE.
THE Glasgow Citizen, in describing the Fºl. appearance of some
of the savans assembled at the meeting of the British Association, is
good enough to remark of the DUKE of ARGYLI, that he looked
“superlatively clean.” Did the Scotch reporter muddle the modicum
of French in § possession, and think it was a case of saron instead of
savant? Or, is it such a wonder that a Scotch Duke should be physicall
clean? Some of the Scotch Dukes (like some of the English ones
have done very dirty things in their time, but it was hardly matter of
surprise that the DUKE of ARGYLL, who, moreover, is a very estimable
young man, should have washed his face and put on a clean shirt upon
such an occasion. To be sure such a luxurious demonstration might
excite a trifle more notice in Glasgow than in most places, but even
there the upper classes occasionally set examples of unobjection-
able neatness. This Citizen has been showing his freedom rather
unwarrantably,

THE INFERIOR ARTICLES OF WAR.
UNCH is disgusted to
observe, that while
are looking at the War
in a patriotic spirit,
the merely mercantile
mind is inquiring,
how the War can be
made to pay, and how
it can be converted
into a medium for
puffing. The press, accord-
ingly teems with advertise-
ments of all sorts of goods,
bads, and indifferents, to
which the word “War” has
been attached, from the War-
Sermon of the puffing parson
to the War-Jacket of the
advertising tailor.
It is rather too bad that a
great cause should be dese-
crated by a connection with
one of the lowest of trades-
men's tricks, and that our
- - triumphs should be converted
into a peg for cheap and inferior clothing to hang upon. -
Already have the names of some of the heroes of the Crimea been given to all
sorts of coats, whose inventors may be said to be hanging on to the skirts of
Victory. It is nevertheless unfair, that our brave generals should be made to give
titles to all kinds of ill-made garments, and that a SIMPson should become synony-
mous with a wraprascal, or that a Pelisseshould usurp the appellation of a PELissner.
One of the advertising tailors has invented a jacket, which he declares is designed
to commemorate one of our recent victories, whose name has been given to the
article alluded to... Glory would indeed be short-lived, if the achievements of our
soldiers had no better commemoration than alow-priced coat, in the sleeve of which
our enemies might comfortably laugh, if they thought that the ſame of our victories
would not be more durable than a bit of º broadcloth.

WERDURE AND FOUNTAINS IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE.
For some time lately the water ejected by the Trafalgar Square Fountains
has been observed to be of a green colour. Speculation is baffled in the attempt
to account for this phenomenon. The Serpentine is the only known source whence
it is easily conceivable that water of such a tint could be derived. But the Foun-
tains are supposed to be supplied from an Artesian well; and there are many
considerations, besides those of a geological nature, which preclude any idea of a
communication between the well and that sewer. Had the well been out of order,
the authorities who preside over it might, perhaps, have entered into an arrange-
ment with one of the Thames Water-Companies, for the temporary, supply of the
Fountains with the fluid, which those societies distribute among the inhabitants
of the Metropolis for drinking purposes. In that case, however, the Fountains
would squirt up a liquid of an “opaque, pale drab-colour,” and not a green, Per-
haps a drainage-pipe leaks into the well, a pipe conveying away the slush from
an adjoining institution, the administrators of which have been at work again
scouring the Old Masters. A correspondent of the Times . the water of
the Fountains to “cabbage-water;” but its tint is more probably derived from the
Old Masters' greens. -
The sº of verdure associated with water-works is very charming, when the
relation between the water and the verdure is merely that of one element in a land:
:* to another. But, when the latter is chemically or mechanically combined
with the former in the º of a solution, the eye is offended; and the disgust of
that organ is usually shared by the nose.
PALMERSTON AT THE ANTIPODES.
We were rather startled a few days ago by reading in capital letters in a column
of the Times the somewhat striking words, “LoRD PALMERston AT MELBourne.”
We knew that Australia was in a condition to need the aid of statesmanship; but
we also felt, that whatever might be the necessities of Victoria in the Colonies,
there is a Victorſ.A at home with a paramount claim on the services of the PREMIER.
We were next disposed to think, that, the affair, was, a joke, and that by way of
showing how º the PRIME MINISTER had been “transported” by the
news of the fallo Sebastopol, he had caused himself to be announced as “LoRD
PAIMERston at Melbourne.” Again, we fancied we º: be indulging in a dream
of the future, and that we might be living in the year 1875, when it is probable that
a minister may be running over from Downing Street to Melbourne as rapidly as he
now passes from London to Paris. All these hypotheses were, however, put to flight
by the sudden recollection that there is a place called Melbourne in England as well

AN ERROR ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
NewsPAPER paragraphs have sounded the praises of the QUEEN, for
her generosity in giving £50 to a Scotch Station-master, for having
been “the fortunate person to bring before HER MAJESTY the glorious
news of the taking of Sebastopol.” The donation was no doubt very
handsome; though the Royal act was evidently one of impulse rather
than of principle; for it is difficult to see why the Station-master
who telegraphed the news, should have been better entitled to £50
than the individual who communicated the fact to him, or the still
earlier informant who worked the telegraph at the Crimea. If priority
of communication is the real ground on which a reward is to be given
the Scotch Station-master seems to be less entitled to £50 than any of
those engaged in transmitting the news, for he is clearly the last person
instead of the first who forwarded the intelligence, which is so graſi-
fying to HER MAJESTY. The practice of giving a handsome gratuity
to the one who immediately communicates a welcome fact, is likely to
retard rather than to expedite good news; for everyone has an interest
in keeping the knowledge of it to himself, until he can personally arrive
at the spot where the information is likely to be lavishly paid for.
Our remarks are not quite in accordance with the tone of flattery that
has been employed by our contemporaries in reference to this piece of
º generosity; but we are quite sure that HER MAJESTY will agree
with our view of the case; and we are ready to admit, that under the
same circumstances, we might have done the same as the QUEEN did, if
we had had £50 to spare, and taken no time for reflection.

would be almost as cruel as to tie a living being

—to bind the brawny limbs of active youth to the

accordingly recognise the wisdom of the citizens
in selecting age before fº else as a quali-
fication for the office of Alderman.
ENGLAND’S HUMILIATION.
(For the Invalided Russe.)
SUCH of our countrymen as are acquainted through our columns with
the real state of public opinion in England, as to the unholy war in
which that island is º: with us, will, we apprehend, be quite pre-
pared to learn that the intelligence of our temporary evacuation of
Sebastopol has plunged the entire kingdom into the deepest mourning
and dejection. Accounts slightly at variance with this statement have,
it is true, been published by the English press; and an obscure print,
called the Times, whose circulation is about as limited as its ability, has
had the effrontery to suggest that a medal should be struck to per-
petuate the memory of our triumphant retreat. . We need, however,
scarcely remind our enlightened readers, that nowhere is the censorship
of the press exercised with greater rigour than in England; and any
editor who had dared in this case to reveal the real feeling of the nation
would have been tried by a court-martial, and in all probability sent to
Coventry, an equivalent, it is well known, to our own Siberia. -
But, notwithstanding the dastardly attempts of the despotic British
Government to prevent the transmission of letters to the Continent—
evinced especially of late by their reduction of the rates of postage—we
have received from one of our own Manchester correspondents, a descrip-
tion of the way in which the so-called victory was actually celebrated: for
the veracity of which our known character of truthfulness will, we do
i. doubt, be a sufficient voucher. In part, for we epitomise his report,
e says:-
“The news of the partial capture of Sebastopol has occasioned here
the greatest sorrow and indignation. Throughout the Metropolis, on
the night of its arrival, the people were so incensed at the Government
that it was found necessary to call out the militia; and an attack being
meditated upon St. James's Palace (the usual autumnal residence of
HER MAJESTY), the %. and her Ministers fled with the greatest
precipitation to the Highlands, where they are still hiding under the
alleged plea of ‘living in retirement.” Knowing somewhat of the real
feeling of the populace, the LoRD MAYoR very prudently declined the
office ofP. the so-termed victory. There is little doubt that
he would have been torn to pieces if he had attempted it. General
illumination there was none, of course. At the French Embassy some
two or three lamps were lit up"on the sly, but on the approach of an
indignant member of the Peace Society they were hurriedly extin-
guished.
“At Woolwich there was a tremendous bonfire in the Arsenal, the
mob destroying several millions’ worth of Government stores. Effigies
of GENERALs SIMPson and PELIssier were burnt à la Guy Faur, and
the boys exploded a vast number of 10-inch shells and Congreve rockets
without the slightest injury to any of the bystanders. -
“The one ship left in Portsmouth had her flag hung half-mast high,
in mourning for the loss of the remainder of the Russian fleet. Her
captain has in consequence been dismissed the service, and is now en
. for St. Petersburg, where he will doubtless be received with
Onour.
“As may be supposed, the demonstration at Manchester was extremely
gratifying. All the manufactories and shops were closed, and the
principal inhabitants appeared in deepest mourning. The bells rang
muffled peals throughout the day, and most of the churches were hung
with black. At a meeting in the evening, a vote of condolence with the
EMPEROR and PRINCE GoRTschakoff was unanimously agreed to, and
a subscription for the late inhabitants of Sebastopol was most liberally
commenced., Three groans having been given for the murderers
SIMPson and PELIssIER, three hearty cheers for Russia were led o
by MR. BRIGHT.
“P.S. There is little doubt that on their return home, the British.
troops will be lynch-lawed and their officers beheaded.”
“OH, BRING ME SHOWERS!”
It never rains but it pours when the penny-a-liners are describing a
storm, and the newspapers are accordingly inundated with torrents of
a most overwhelming character. A recent paragraph describes a series
of showers in the Jura, which were distinguished by hailstones of the
size of an º and the appearance of which must have been greeted
with a cry of, Hail, fellow, well met!” from the delighted dealer in
!. s. We have no doubt that if the hailstones in question re-
sembled eggs, their existence may be traced to some adjacent mare's-
nest... It is possible that the reporter may have somewhat exaggerated
the violence of the showers; and although he cannot be, accused of
giving the reins to his imagination, it is not unlikely that his imagina-
tion j. have been the principal source of the excessive rains he so
copiously dilates-or dilutes—upon.

POETIC REWARD.
The Athenaeum corrects an error of Mr. Punch, and Mr. Punch owns
that he blushes for the mistake, albeit really not his, but the scurvy
blunder of whosoever for the time being distributed the pensions
to literature, art, and science. Mr. Punch lately stated, that Miss
FRANCEs BRowN (the Blind Poetess) was in the small enjoyment of
£50 a-year. The gratification is not, it seems, half that amount, being
no more than £20. The liberal, the literary (for the Wiscount has in
his time dallied with quill and ink), the chivalrous PALMERston will,
surely, on the next partition of the pension list, end this scandal.

How many a plain cook, whose genius stops short at the perfect boiling
of a potato, rejoices in a larger income! It is even better to be maid-of-
all-work to the Mowbrays of Baker Street than handmaiden to the
Muses of Parnassus.
QUICKSILVER MARTYRS.
THE Greeks always paid great homage to Mercury, because he was
the God of Thieves and of Merchandise, whence latter word came his
name. It would seem that a hankering after this idolatry is still sup-
to prevail among the modern Greeks, and an illustration of the
act is found in the circumstance that certain Greek corn-merchants, in
one of our large towns, have been accused of not being able to keep
their hands of a Barometer much consulted by folks whose corn trans.
actions are guided by the state of the weather; The suspected indi-
viduals have denied the charge of tampering with the instrument, but
we should have honoured them more had they admitted it (if true), and
oured for the right of exercising their religious worship in a free
country. This would have shown that Greeks make some pretence to
conscience, and the novelty of this discovery would render it doubly
acceptable.
A Letter for Doctor Pettigrew.
Doctor PETTIGREw, of London, acknowledges the receipt, per post
from Somersetshire, of “a live lizard, measuring 19 inches in length;
lively, after having undergone no less than eight post-office stampings.
A live bluebottle, placed as food for the lizard, was dead at the journey's
end.” This is all very well for an experiment, but we hope it will stop
here. Otherwise, should the hint be maliciously improved upon, we
may have porcupines delivered by post in their own letters, and hedge-
hogs in their own envelopes.
CHEAP TESTIMONIALS.
A TESTIMONIAL has been presented to jolly SIR. John Tyssen
TYRRELL, in the shape of his own portrait painted by lucas; and
showing the best and most gratifying evidence of the fact that, º
England is destroyed, ..i. wiped from the map of nations by
the repeal of the Corn Laws, SIR John, like a protectionist.and a
philosopher, still looks gay and hearty, “smiling at ruin.” We are
glad that ŠIR John is favoured with his own picture; but in other
cases would suggest a more economic style of testimonial. For in-
stance, instead of giving a man his own portrait fixed in oils, why Lot

OUR eye is continually falling on an advertisement relating to the
stomach and its difficulties.” §. should find it no easy task to fill a
book on the subject, but we believe that a great deal may be got into a
very small compass where the stomach is concerned. The difficulties
of the stomach vary of course, according to the circumstances of the
owner, for while with one, class the difficulty is “how to fill it,” with
another class the great object is to º it within moderate dimensions;
We have no doubt that the author fully understands his subject, and
#. numerous his readers, he wººd of course have “stomach for
them all.”
“A Line must be Drawn."
THE EMPEROR of Russia, in his despatch on the downfall of Sebas-
topol, thanks its valiant defenders even in their defeat, saying–
“There is a line which is impassable even to heroes!"
That line has now been found the line in blue, and now the line in
red. There is, however, another line, to be drawn in diplomatic ink; a
º#. be traced in the new map to be prepared by the Western Powers
Or Ivussia.
Shah! Nonsense !
WE have carefully perused the Persian Treaty recently entered into
between the Shah and the EMPEROR or the FRENch, We see no
objection to it, except that in recounting the glories of the high con-
tracting parties, it states that each “takes the Sun for a Standard.”
The Persian sovereign may know no better than this, but the EMPERoR
is well acquainted with our journals, and ought not to have been
described as capable of making such a blunder. He would be as likely
to take the Record for a Punch.

butcher, as an intermediate agent between the owner of the animal and
the individual who eats it. e confess we should feel considerable
inconvenience in having to kill the whole of our animal food, and we
are quite sure that not one of our readers, who . wish for a pound of
steak, would feel disposed to purchase and slaughter an entire bullock;
Such, however, would be the case if the butcher were to be abolished, and
every transaction in meat were to be an affair between the grazier and
the consumer. It would be hard, indeed, if one could not indulge in, a
pork chop without buying an entire pig, which would be going the
whole hog in a most unequivocal manner.
CAPTURE OF THE GREAT AMERICAN
WATER-SNARE,
We may now very soon look for the capture of the Sea Serpent,
seeing that as a sort of instalment of the “take,” the dwellers on the
Silver Lake, near Perry Willage, New York, did on the 12th of A t
harpoon and haul to land the Great American Water-Snake! There
can be no doubt of the interesting fact, all the circumstances being
detailed with that precision, that delicacy of touch, that so distinguishes
every American record of wonders and triumphs....When Niagara sub-
sided to a dead level, what other quill, save a quill from the American
eagle, could so truly have painted the catastrophe. A kindred pen-a
pen from the same pinion-traces, the last moments of the Great
American Water-Snake. The Snake, in an evil hour for himself,
appeared to the whalemen provided with a harpoon. He was laying
“quiescent on the surface,” when-
“The iron whistled in the air, and went deep into his body!"
Under these circumstances, prolonged quiescence was not to be
expected; assuredly not. Therefore-
“Instantly the whole length of snake lashed the airl"
That is, the snake bird-like raised its whole body in vacancy; but
only for a while, for he darted off, almost †† boat under
water. However, in due season, he was hauled to land, when, as was
very natural on their part-
“Four or five ladies fainted on seeing the snake, who, although ashore, lashed his
body into tremendous folds, and then straightened himself out in agony, with a noise
that made the earth tremble."
BARNUM himself had shaken in his shoes at such a snake-quake.
And now follows a most interesting description of the victim:
“He is fifty-nine feet eight inches in length, and has a most disgusting look. A
slime a quarter of an inch thick covers his body, and if removed is instantly replaced
by exudation. The body is variable in size. The head is the size of a full-grown calf.”
In fact, exactly the size of the heads of the believers in the Fejee
mermaid and in WASHINGTON's negress nurse.
“Within eight feet of the head, the neck gradually swells to the thickness of a foot
in diameter. It then tapers down, and again gradually swells to a diameter of two feet
in the centre, giving above six feet girth. It then tapers off towards the tail and ends
in a fin, which can expand in fan shape three feet across or close in a sheath. Double
rows of fins are alternately placed along the belly.”
The “fan-shaped fin” must have some affinity to the mermaid; whilst
the “sheath” would imply, at least, a distant relation to the sword-fish:
“The head is most singular. The eyes are large, staring, and terrific, with a trans-
parent membrane attached to the lids, protecting the eye without impeding the vision.
No gills appear. The mouth is like that of the fish called a sucker. It can stretch so
as to swallow a body a foot and a half in diameter.”
In fact, about the same capacity of swallow as that required of the
docile and elastic reader.

at, and the air rushes forth with a heavy short puff.”
There is this *: in the last faculty of the Great Water-Snake;
for dealing in “heavy, short puffs,” he will be able to write, his own
advertisements from the Museum in the Broadway. The “slime, that
a quarter of an inch thick covers his body,” will supply him with ink:
exudation.”
We have solicited the scientific opinion of the first maturalist of the
day-need we name him—as to the classification to which this Water-
Snake is clue; and have received the following brief summary—“It is

KNIGHTHOOD OF THE STEAM-BATH.
THE Order of the Bath is an order of chivalry almost as
oddly named as the Order of the Garter: . One would think
it should rather be the reward of dirty doings than of noble
deeds. The Order of the Bath is a very proper sequence
of a committal to the House of Correction, and shameful
behaviour is suitably requited with a ducking. A warm
bath is a very good and a very comfortable thing; but so
is a sofa, so is an arm-chair, so is a hot-water bottle, so are
many other domestic conveniences, which, in relation to
warlike achievements, or any other grand exploits and
magnanimous actions, are º: absurd. What sort of a
Bath can that be, the Order of which is esteemed a fitting
recompense for the valour of the heroes who fought before
Sebastopolº
It appears to be a Vapour Bath, a Bath designed to
promote perspiration. Warriors, by means thereof, are
subjected to that process to which certain Semitic persons
are accused of being accustomed to subject sovereigns, and
with similar results. Admission into the Order of the Bath
costs the Knight Grand Cross £164 13s. 4d.; that is to say,
the Knight on whom that honour is conferred is let into
it for that amount. This money is distributed among
various persons employed about the Bath. A head man
called Bath-King-at-Arms, for example, sacks two separate
º of it, amounting together to £28 13s. 4d. The
ean of the Order pockets £22 6s. 8d.; the Gentleman
Usher nets the same sum. The Messenger walks off with
£18.13s. 4d., the Secretary sweeps up £6 13s. 4d. The
Registrar and Genealogist come in for £22 a-piece. One
would suppose that the service rendered by these persons
consists in shampooing the Knight; they appear to do
º effectually, for they certainly squeeze a great deal out
Ol Illin.
What does a man get, then, for bleeding for his country
who gets the Qrder of the Bath? He gets antiphlogistic
treatment. Having lost blood, he has to swallow a
sudorific.

A Generous Enemy.
PRINCE GoRTschakoff takes credit to himself and his
troops for having rendered Sebastopol aheap of “blood-
stained ruins” for the reception of the Allies. We are very
much obliged to him.
A BARGAIN ON HORSEBACK.
We are always happy to assist in the º: a problem; and,
although we think that the following inquiry should have been repub-
lished by our excellent contemporary, Notes and Queries, rather than by
Mr. Punch, still, we cheerfully submit it for the consideration of the
world. The demand originally appeared in the Stamford Mercury. The
names of the parties not seeming to affect, the interesting inquiry in
question, we substitute asterisks, in order that the philosophical world
may proceed, unimpassioned, to the abstract problem.

which I did; and then, after it was wrote, he refused to sign!—Is that a Gentleman, or
what? (Signed) * * * * * * * *.
We would rather abstain from giving our own opinion at the present
stage of the investigation; but we incline to the conviction, that that
is rather to be considered a pronoun than a gentleman; and we cannot
at all assent to the view that it is what. Qther interesting points arise
on considering the above advertisement. It may be surmised from the
allusion to the horse, that the advertiser was smoking, and that the
other party told him he was welcome to a light. The word “wrote,”
would seem out of place, but (the subject being agricultural) may have
something to do with the wrotation of crops. #. mystery deepens
as we proceed; and we invite everyone to forward speculations on the
topic, distinctly pledging ourselves that none of them shall be inserted.

THE DISTILLER
IN DIFFICULTIES.
E are informed by a
Scotch Distiller, that
the Commissioners
of Inland. Revenue
have published, for
the guidance of Su-
rvisors and Distil-
ers, a book of in-
structions: in which
occurs the following
direction:-
“The windows of the
mill-room, if not glazed,
must have coverings of
wire gauze or perforated
metal, and be so secured
that no malt can be re-
moved through them.
The man is to be locked
in, and the door must not
be opened for his ingress
or egress oftener than
once in three hours, and
then only on notice in
writing, except in cases
of emergency.”
Poor man! How is he to make his emergency known? The Board
does not, we suppose, require that anybody shalſ be in attendance out-
side the door to open it, in the event of an “emergency” occurring to
the man...What is he to do? Write a formal demand for liberation
and F. it under the door—for he will be unable to throw it out of
window-and take the chance of its getting picked up and conveyed to
the key-keeper? Or shout and scream º ground of his
º to * released in a loud voice?-Bit suppose his emergency were
apoplexy
Our spirituous Scotch friend furnishes us with two other notable
precepts from the same code; viz., firstly:-
"The sacks in which malt is removed must be free from patches or holes, and the
folds of the seams must be in the inside. The mouth of each sack is to be securely
tlosed by the trader with strong cord, sewn or fastened to the bagging, and when tied,
passing twice at least round the neck.”
That a sack of malt should be free from holes is not merely very -
desirable, but absolutely necessary. But one would think that the
urchaser might be safely left to take care of that. Caveat emptor.
hat the folds of the seams of the sack should be in the inside is mani-
fest, but the Inland Revenue Board might have been saved the trouble
of making an express order to that effect by the consideration, that
there is hardly anybody who would be likely to turn the seamy side
outwards.
Secondly:-
"With a packing needle, a piece of red tape is to be drawn through a fold in the
neck of the sack, drawn tight round the neck, and tied in a double knot, the ends are
then to be passed through the small holes of a leaden seal, the tape drawn tight and
tied in another double knot, when the lead is to be shifted, so as to cover the last
named knot, and the seal is to be firmly closed upon it, with an impression of the die
with which each officer is to be furnished.”
The great Macedonian cut-throat and robber, the namesake of the
º EMPEROR of Russia, contrived to deal with the Gordian knot
y cutting it. That knot had to be untied,—this has to be tied; pro-
bably, however, the Distiller will treat the Government knot as the
despoiler treated the Gordian, and cut the thing. Being Davus and
not (EDIPus, he will never attempt to solve such a puzzle as the formula
above quoted; which the Commissioners of Inland Revenue had better
send in for publication in the next edition of the Boys' Own Book,
accompanied, of course, by an explanatory diagram. It will not have
escaped observation, that the ligament by which this wonderful knot
has to be tied on the malt-sack, by order of Government, is Red Tape.
A very proper material for that application. Red Tape to the sack–
the sack to Red Tape!
GERMAN DOMESTIC ECONOMY.
How is it, that in the German hotels they never give you any more
than one towel? - -
How is it, that they are just as liberal with their water?—the quantity
iven º, the proportion that in England is generally put into a
r-glass
ow is it, that at dinner they only give you one knife and fork to do
duty for about five-and-forty dishes, consisting of every possible variety
of joint, game, pastry, fruit.preserve, pickle, and cabbage?.
f this is the cleanliness, if this is the system of domestic economy
practised by the Germans in their best hotels, where everything is open
to the criticism of strangers, we tremble to think what can be the state
of cleanliness, and what must be the awful destitution of domestic
economy, practised by them in their own homes! -
CRIMINAL PREFERENCE.
WE read in a weekly contemporary,
“Many of our most active thieves now prefer immediate punishment under the new
larceny act, instead of the former system of delay.”
This statement must afford gº to every reader. Any legis-
lative improvement which tends to the facilitation of commerce—the
equivalent of thieving, according to court poets—must be welcome to
a commercial population. The “delay,” which used to impede the
“activity” of operations in silk, specie, purse-leather, and other articles,
was much to be deplored, and we doubt not that the amended “system.”
will be found to have an invigorating effect upon the markets, especially
those in Field Lane and Houndsditch. Could any further plan be
suggested for Fº the unnecessary shackling of commerce, or
commercialists?: A Thieves' Clearing-House, perhaps, might be advan-
tageously established, and the banking experience of an eminent and
saintly prig-now in durance—would naturally point him out for its
Superintendent, when the expiration of certain probable engagements
shall permit him again to i. his attention to business. In the
meantime we trust that the Magistrates will do their best to carry out
the intention of the Legislature, and with as little “delay” as possible
consign."many of our most active thieves” to the sphere in which
their activity may have the amplest scope, and where Whips and Cranks

may reward its “wanton wiles.”

OUR affectionate cousins in America so seldom give us credit for
being in advance of themselves in the smallest matter, that it is doubly
vexing, when they do condescend to praise us, to find the praise unde-
served. A case of this kind occurs in the last file of New York papers.
A fearful railway catastrophe-"massacre”—the New York Herald
more justly calls it, had elicited a very severe article from the Editor,
who vehemently denounced the cupidity and negligence of railway
Directors, and the inefficiency of the laws to compel them, to º:

taken place on our own lines. The only Fº which, we are #.

tendency to the most vul-
gar display and tasteless
extravagance. ... We are
therefore not disposed to
be very hard on a Gover-
nor, who gives a cheap and
wholesome lemonade to a
population, saturated with
strong drinks; and who
offers limited supplies of

whose usual beverage is
described by the greatest
possible combinations of

ETURN BALL.--To His Excellency the Governor of
Victoria, SIR CHARLES HOTHAM, K.C.B., Rear Admiral of
the Blues.
Several Gentlemen being Highly Gratified with their reception at
TOORAK HOUSE, on the evening of the 24th of May last, the Anni-
versary of the Birth Day of
HER MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY THE QUEEN,
And having fully appreciated the Lesson of Economy which His
Excellency so graciously and feelingly taught them that evening, have
entered into arrangements with MR. CUTITFINE, to give a
RETURN BALL to His Excellency, On the 24th of June next,
And are happy to say that, in order to bring it within the reach of all
parties,
Tickets are 1s, each. Ladies Free.
This seems to be a discharge of very small shot against
SIR CHARLes HotHAM's Ball, and it is only fair to the
Governor to say, that if he exhibits economy in his public
entertainments, it is not for the sake of pecuniary profit to
himself; , for while he practises retrenchment on those
beneath him, he sets the good example of voluntarily
relinquishing a portion of his own salary. In a colon
where, animal indulgences are eagerly squght, while inteſ.
lectual pursuits are almost entirely neglected, a lesson of
abstinence from the grosser kind of gratifications should be
regarded as a subject of encouragement rather than a theme
for ridicule. Even in our own, more civilised society, a
wholesome example would be set by any one in high quarters
who would hold out some nobler inducement than gluttony
to ºf people together. Somebody has already introduced
the fashion of “dancing teas,”, and we wish somebody else
would boldly establish “boiled-beef-and-beer balls,” in op-
position to those extravagant quadrille suppers which half
ruin the host, while damaging the digestion of his visitors.

THE WOMEN'S FRIEND SOCIETY.
It is not very easy, if we look abroad upon the world, to find a more
atrocious kind of savages than the Russians; wretches who fire on their
own comrades, if in murdering them they have a chance of shooting their
enemies; miscreants who bayonet their º helpless antagonists;
demons who set the haunt they are expelled from on fire, and leave
their own miserable sick and wounded men to burn alive in the ruins.
The subjects of the KING OF DAHOMEy, or those of the Sovereign who
rules the roast of the Cannibal Islands, may be a little more disgusting
in their customs, but in conduct they are not at all more barbarous
than the slaves of the CzAR of MUscovy.
A more anticelestial set of brutes than the Russians we do not see in
the world if we look abroad. No; but ruffians of a yet lower grade
are to be found by anybody who will look at home. He has only to
walk into the London slums, when his ears will be assailed by the most
hideous yells, the most revolting words, and the most blasphemous
curses, uttered by those ruffians, and mingled with the most piercing
and dreadful screams, which proceed from women whom they are
beating, kicking, and trampling to death, and who are their wives.
A Russian female has, or had, on the occasion of her marriage, to
present the male with a whip, usually manufactured by herself, in token
of her *'. to the stronger brute; but it does not appear that

frantic ferocity of the British blackguard.
The outrageous maltreatment of women is becoming a specific crime,

battery; and provision that, if convicted of that dustardly offence, he
shall be duly, punished, should be the object of an Association hereby
proposed, to be called the Society on is Preven mono, CRUELTY
To WomeN.
It is quite clear that, the object of this Society can be accomplished
only in one way, namely, by securing for the cowardly offender the
infliction of an extreme and acute amount of bodily suffering, pain, and
unpleasantness.
Whipping is for brutes; and only for those brutes that are incor-
rigible by any other means. A dog ought not to be whipped for any
purpose which could be answered by coaxing. But the habit of walking
on two legs, and the faculty of speech, are not sufficient to constitute a
human being; and the brute who beats women, has no sensibility to
appeal to but that of his skin. He cannot be degraded; he has sunk
to the zero of laseness, and is fit for nothing but to be lacerated by the
cat-of-ninetails, that he may howl and scream, and stand as a scarecrow
for a warning to other brutes like himself.
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty, to Women should en-
deavour to get a whipping-clause added to the Women's Protection
Act as soon as possible.
If the Whip will not suffice, add the Pillory. It will not demoralise
the populace to cast any filth on a recipient much fitter for it than any

IN 1798, says the Annual Register, “Eight hundred heads
of Frenchmen were exhibited before the Seraglio in Con-
stantinople.” In 1855, a good many more were to be seen
in the same place, with the advantage of having stalwart
bodies attached to them. The SULTAN has discovered that
the Seraglio itself is all the safer from his importing his
Frenchmen entire, and this advance in commercial science
warrants us in hoping for further progres:Teven the
exportation of the “old Turkish *. ” one of these days.
This is the most objectionable old party we ever heard of,
worse than MRs. HARRIs herself, or her Protectionists, and
the sooner its heads—we mean, of course, its leaders—are
sailing down the Bosphorus, the better, under the direction
of their friend, the new and bigoted Caroopaun Pasha.
We know that the SULTAN has Punch read to him, and
we trust that he will excuse this hint: we make no
scruple in poking him up for his good, as the Turkish is
the only Porte benefited by being shaken up.
BOW, WOW, WOW I
ONE of the features of the “organ nuisance” which appears to have
escaped notice, is that occasioned by the newspapers themselves when
they become the organs of twaddle. A weekly contemporary, which
seems to have what the French call a spécialité for the gossip of
servants, and the other “ kitchen stuff” of the Court, produced last
week from its collection of literary perquisites an account of the QUEEN
jº'º. an apartment at St. Cloud, during her recent visit, and
remarked *, the EMPEROR, “If my own little dºg were lying in that
chair, I would assuredly fancy myself at Windsor.”
In the first place, it is not likely that HER MAJESTY would have
been so ungracious to her. Imperial host, as to have expressed any
hankering after Windsor while on a visit to the French capital. There
are, however, more absurdities as the story proceeds; for we are told
that on the QUEEN's entering the apartment the next morning the
“canine favourite” was sleeping on the identical chair, which HER
MAJESTY had been pleased to indigitate. How the dog found his
way to Paris is a mystery that is solved by the statement, that “the
EMPEROR had telegraphed for the animal, which, being sent off by
express, arrived in time to surprise and delight its Royal mistress.” Of
course there must have been special trains on both sides of the Channel,
with a special steamer to cross it, and special attendants to take charge
of the pet, who must have been sent specially to º in order to
secure its position on the chair specially selected by the QUEEN for
canine occupation. When all these little difficulties are got over, there
yet remains the puzzling question, how the facts came to be known to
the newspaper reporter, whose information must, in the first instance

PROOFS THAT PARLIAMENT IS UP.
(With a Sub-Editor's Compliments.)
º
HERE is an old lady now
living at Sherborne who has
attained the age of ninety-six
years, having been born in
1759. She has therefore
lived in five reigns; namely,
those of GEORGE THE SE-
cond, GeoRGE THE THIRD,
GeoRGE THE FourTH, WIL-
LIAM THE Fourth, and Our
Gracious QUEEN, the present
occupant of the throne of
these regions.

gleton Church, Gloucester-

tribute this to a conductor
having been put up in 1825.
The weather has been so
unusually mild this autumn,
that in various parts of the
country, cages of canaries,
ring-doves, Java sparrows,
and 9ther domestic favour-
ites, have been left out of doors during the entire night without doing
the animals any injury.
FROM the circumstance of several flights of birds, on the peculiar
species of which our informants differ, having passed over
lain, apparently on their way to the sea, the observers of the weather
in that part of England are inclined to believe, that there will be a good
deal of severe weather either before or after Christmas.
As some labourers were lately digging in a field near Petersham, the
spade of one of them struck upon a hard substance, which being disin-
terred, proved to be the blade of a knife. There is no evidence as to the
date of its being deposited, but the REvKREND WILLIAM BoDGE, F.S.A.
(in whose domain it was discovered), has deciphered the letters
R. o. G. E. R. upon it, and considers that it may have belonged to RoGER
BAcon, who is known to have visited Petersham.
WHAT might have been amelancholy accident took place at Worthing
last Monday. A small boat, capable of holding about eight persons,
broke away from her anchorage on the sand, and drifting out to sea,
nearly capsized. Fortunately there were no persons in her (though as
late as the previous Saturday she had taken a party out for a row), and
she was ultimately recovered by a shrimper.
THE Gentlemen of the Long Robe will, it is whispered, derive more
satisfaction from an action about to be brought at the next assizes, to
be held not a hundred miles from * * ***, than a gallant gay Lothario

verdict for breach of promise of ºf; that though “a Rose by any
other name might smell as sweet,” stil that “the labour.” the learned
counsel “delight in” will decidedly “physic Payne.” We say no more.

THE RUSSIAN PIG-MARKET.
An old English saying expresses a man's i. unpleasant con-
sequences through any speculative proceeding, by describing him as
having driven his pigs to a pretty market. According to “A SUNDER-
LAND MAN,” writing to the Times, there are certain Sunderland swine-
merchants who deserve to find that they have driven their pigs to a
market of that sort. It appears that,
“At the present time there are many thousand tons of pig iron lying on the quays of
Sunderland Dock: this iron is being (and has been during the year) ship off for
Stettin. The captains of the Prussian vessels say: “We carry it to Prussia, it then
walks off to Russia.'”
Are there no means, by an Order in Council, for instance, of walking
off such pigs as these into HER MAJESTY's arsenals, and their pro-
prietors into some of HER MAJESTY's prisons. hulks, or penal
settlements?

FIGHTING DOG EXTRAORDINARY.
Wondeºrull will be the ejaculation of some people, whilst others
perhaps will invoke the name of WALKER, on reading a very extra-
ordinary story of a fighting dog related by the Gazette of Trieste. At
the battle of the Tchermaya, according to that journal, as quoted by
the Post:
“While the struggle was at its hottest, a large dog belonging to Colonel METTMANN,
of the 73rd Regiment of the Line, broke his chain, and rushed into the midst of the
combatants. Having saved the lives of a sergeant and a soldier, and made three
Russians prisoners"—
This twofold ſeat we presume the sagacious animal accomplished by
the single act of seizing the three Russians who were going to shoot
the two Englishmen. He probably managed the matter by grasping
them all three between his fore-paws; which he must have been a large
dog to do: but it would have required a still larger dog to hold three
men at once in his mouth. Without, however, stopping to explain this
little difficulty, the Trieste paper proceeds—
—“he received a severe bullet wound in the leg, notwithstanding which, he continued
in the field, and ppling with an officer among the enemy brought him to the
ground, and secured his capture.”
This clever º only brought his prisoner to the ground, but,
when he had got him, there, secured him--by what means our Trieste
contemporary omits also to state; no doubt by tying his hands and legs
together with his own sash, . It is astonishing what dogs can be
trained to do, The reader will be gratified by the information that—
"After the battle the leg of the animal was carefully dressed by an army surgeon,
and it is said that he will receive a medal, in token of the fidelity and prowess which
he displayed.”
There will not be wanting some persons who will be of opinion that
a bone, perhaps, would have been a more suitable reward for this
yaliant dog than a medal. But he could not have wanted bones. He
had doubtless killed a great many Russians in the course of the day,
and eaten all he had killed, and a very proper meal for such a consumer
are the brutes who bayonet our wounded, and fire upon our ambu-
lances removing their own.
The breed of this remarkable animal is not mentioned. Displaying
so much bull-dog courage and enormous strength, he may reasonabl
presumed to have been a bull-dog of fºliº size; a bull-dog muc

THE NUDE IN RAILWAYS.
A cuRIous difficulty has accompanied the opening of
railway traffic in India. The Mofussilite—a very smartly
edited paper, by the way-apprises us that the natives have
an objectionable custom of taking aticket—and nothing else
—for their journey, or, in other words, that they insist upon
getting into the trains either in puris naturalibus, or with
such an apology for clothing as is more to be deprecated
than the statuesque negation of raiment. A Baboo seems to
have been pitched out of a carriage for such Arcadianism,
and to have brought an action against his ejector. We
hardly know what ground he will take, unless he puts for-
ward the legal fiction, that, having purchased his place, he
was what the law calls, “clothed with the freehold,” but
whether the Indian courts will consider this a sufficient
travelling costume, we cannot say. The Directors should
put in the corner of their tickets, as our theatrical managers
do on private box-orders, “Full Dress,” and an Indian Jew
might turn an anna by keeping a stall at each station, and
letting out costumes, varied in price and elegance, according
to the class of carriage to which a traveller aspired. It is
odd, that while the Crystal Palace people are assailed by
silly folks, for not attiring their casts, the people whose
castes are the originals, renounce attire. However, we trust
that the difficulty will be amicably adjusted, and that when
our Indian friends take a ride in the Company's carriages,
they will remember their company manners. Every elephant
they pass on the line should remind them that a trunk is
essential, and they should consider, that if they would bring
their journey to a fitting close, they must really bring
fitting clothes to their journey.
A Wash to Cure a Nuisance.
An interesting modification of a well-known hydraulic
apparatus has been devised by an ingenious mechanist. It
is an elegant form of the common garden engine, adapted
to drawing-rooms; and its purpose is not to irrigate the
lants in the balcony, for promotion of their growth, but to

they have all evidently a great objection.
WHO HAS ASCENDED MONT BLANCP
SINCE MR. ALBERT SMITH has made the ascent of Mont Blanc the
º to popularity and profit, there seems to be a fashion for following
is steps, and another and another, expedition to the summit of the
Monarch of Mountains is continually being chronicled. Among those
who have made the experiment during the present year is a resident of
Barnard's Inn, who is much hurt at an insinuation that he did not reach
the top; and who has written to the Times to complain of this cruel
imputation on his altitude-attaining character. He admits having made
one failure, but then he had “lost his Alpentstock; ” a guide had
“refused to carry his great-coat;" and the same guide had cruelly left
him “without any stimulant.” e were not aware that “stimulants”
were needed on these occasions; for, though we have heard of people
being “elevated” by champagne, we doubt whether anyone would be
able to get to the top of Mont Blanc by such a mode of elevation. It
seems, however, that the occupant of Barnard's Inn was not to be kept
own by common disasters; and he accordingly made another attempt,
which was so perfectly successful, that the Syndic has given a certi-
ficate under his hand and seal of the feat having been accomplished.
Considering how pleasantly one can ascend, Mont Blanc, in the
company of MR. ALBERT SMITH, at the Egyptian Hall, it seems un-
necessarily laborious and expensive to perform the task elsewhere than
in Piccadilly. As there are many, however, who will, not be satisfied
without going up something or other, and being “able to, say” they
have actually “been at the top,” we think that Primrose Hill might be
used as a cheap and commodious substitute for the Swiss original. An
arrangement might be made for the attendance of a “Syndic” |. 8.
policeman specially appointed for the duty might be figuratively called)
io grant certificates to those reaching the summit of the Metropolitan
Mount; and the payment of a small fee would amply repay any expense
attending the performance of this extra duty. As the object of most
people in going to out-of-the-way places is to be able." to say they have
been,” it matters little what the place may be, if it is understood that
it shall be regarded as an achievement to have arrived there.
“I’LL LEND THEE A WIND.”
THE British Association, for the . Advancement of Science has
advanced it at last, with what revengeful. call a vengeance. The
DUKE of ARGYLL, with characteristic m *}; abstained from alluding
to the feat in his inaugural address, but Mr. Punch is restrained by no
ducal mauvaise honte fromat once proclaiming the fact in his loudest tones.
Among the papers which were read before the Association, was one
thus described in the Syllabus:-
“Captain Fitzroy, R.N.—Communication of New CHARTs or WIND Movement ox
The SURFACR or The Globe in Accordance with the Directions of the Board of Trade.”
The Board of Trade, therefore, now directs the Movements of the
Wind over the surface of the Globe, and the vulgar joke about a Clerk
of the Weather-Office becomes a mere administrative truism...The long
and exhaustive experiments of Government in raising the Wind have
finally, resulted more satisfactorily than could have been expected, an
we hear that the rate of insurance at Lloyd's has been greatly reduced
since it has been known that a captain, instead of 3. to a Lapland
witch to buy a wind, has only to send to the President of the Board of
Trade. It is needless to dilate upon the great commercial advantages
which this acquisition will give us over all other nations, or to show
how we shall take the wind out of their Sales; but what does THOMAs
CARLYLE say to official Windbags, now? It is delightful to think that
we shall be able to give a heavy #low as well as a great discouragement
to all competition, and we trust that the Board of Trade means to take
care to have the #ight Wind in the Right Place.
Dead Weight.
AMERICA may certainly boast that her contributions to the Paris
Exhibition are on a very extended scale, for the principal object sent
from the United States consists of a long row of weighing machines.
This is quite characteristic of a calculating people like the Americans,
who attach more importance to the power of the balance among them-
selves than to the European of power.

RAILWAY LUXURIES.
We have been rather mystified by an advertisement issued from the
offices of the North-Western Railway; and as the publishers of Christ;
mas collections of puzzles will be shortly on the look-out for “novelty,”
we beg to call their attention to the following:-
ONDON AND NORTH WESTERN RAILWAY CONTRACT for
PERMANENT MATERIALS.—The Directors of the London and North Western
*:::::::::::::: are prepared to receive Tenders for the supply of the undermen-
tioned 100,000 Sleepers.
4,000 Tons Chairs.
500 Tons Fish Plates.
275 Tons Spikes.
120 Tons Bolts and Nuts.
Specifications, with Particulars, may be obtained on application to the Permanent
Way Office, Railway Station, Stafford.
Tenders addressed to the Secretary, at this Office, to be sent in on or before Wednes-
day, 10th October, 1855.
By Order, CHAs. EDWD. STEWART, Secretary.
Secretary's Office, Euston Station,
15th September, 1855.
We think our readers will admit that the above announcement pre-
sents * materials for the ingenuity of any Wizard of the North, or
the South, or the North-East-by-East, or any other still more acute
quarter of the compass, to go to work upon. ...We can understand an
extensive demand for sleepers on, certain lines where, somnolency
among the officials is such a constant habit as to amount to what may
be called their “permanent way,” but we should hardly have expected
that “sleepers” would be in request on a line so generally wide awake
as the London and North-Western. The other requirements of the
Directors appear to be of a somewhat festive kind, including, as they
do,"4000 tons of chairs,” and “500 tons of fish-plates;” from which we
infer that a fish dinner on a most extensive scale may be in contem-
plation. We cannot help thinking that the number of fish-plates seems
rather excessive, and that a few dessert-plates might be substituted,
especially as the advertisement shows that several tons of nuts—which
can only be introduced by way of dessert, -are required. What on
earth the Directors intend to do with such an enormous quantity of
nuts is a mystery, which we leave those who are desirous of dealing
with "nuts to crººk” to elucidate.

MR. PUNCH does not very, often waste his space upon bumptious

e must sacrifice an inch of room to a nest of folly which he routed the
other day out of the Globe.
“MR. and Mrs. Poppy Bloor have arrived at the family mansion, No. 51, Barnacle

AS SAFE AS THE BANK.
THE writer of the money article of one of the morning
papers talks of “the suicidal course adopted by the
Directors of the Bank of England.”. This is rather strong
language; and would make a timid person believe that
the Directors contemplated self-destruction. . If the Bank
housemaid should be a nervous individual, and were to read
the paragraph in question, she would be afraid, to open the
Bankshutters, lest she might find a quorum of the Directors
hanging together in the Bank Parlour. We must confess
that the word “suicidal” is rather objectionable in other
tº: for as the Bank happens to be a Corporation, and
a Corporation never dies, it would be an absurdity on the
art of the Old Lady in Threadneedle Street to attempt to
ay, violent hands . herself, as she could not make away
with herself in an effectual manner.
RUSSIAN REASONING.
s HAT ingenious
|\) print Le Nord,
evidently at its
wit’s end to find
an excuse for
the evacuation
of Sebastopol,
(which by the
way, we under-
stand was first
telegraphed to
St. Petersburg
as a “success-
ful retrograde
movement of our
troops,”) apolo-
gises thus:
“Impartial his-
tory will do justice
to the resolution of PRINCE GoRTschakoff, who by making a momentary sacrifice,
and avoiding a useless effusion of blood, has preserved for Russia an army trained to
war by a struggle of a year's duration, which for intensity has no parallel in military
annals, and placed that army in a position which enables him to hold a commanding
situation."
We have small wish to detract from the character of PRINCE GoRT-
schAkoFF as a military genius, but we cannot help remarking that the
successful “preservation” of his army, for which he is here so abun:
dantly commended, must not be regarded in the light of an original
conception; it clearly is a plagiarism of
“He who fights and runs away
May live to fight another day.”
We do not know what precise duration of time the writer in his own
mind would assign to the “sacrifice” he here describes as merel
“momentary;”, but certainly, unless that adjective have a widely dif-
ferent meaning in his dictionary to that which DR. Johnson gives it, we
think he might with greater chance of truth have used a more endurin
one. As for PRINCE GoRTschAKOFF's retreat enabling him to “hol
a commanding situation,” that, for Russian ears, is well enough; but
it reads to us certainly a little akin to sarcasm. For with our know-
ledge of despotic governments, we should not be surprised if the loss of
Sebastopol were to entail upon PRINCE GoRTschakoff the loss of the
only “commanding situation” we can admit him still to hold-namely,
the situation of Commanding Officer.
TRUMPETERS.
THERE are three sorts: 1st, the Impudent Man, who blows his own
trumpet: 2nd, the Clever Man, who gets the trumpet generally blown
for him: and 3rd, the Really Clever Man, who will see all the trumpets
blown first before he will stoop to any such trumpery expedients. It
is for the latter that Fame takes up the instrument, and, with a
trumpet-note, sounds their names all over the world; but, as this class
is necessarily a very small one, we cannot quarrel with the modesty of
certain men, who, feeling there is but little chance of Fame, ever
blowing the trumpet for them, become subscribers of that highly-
º Musical Society of, “Every Man His Own Trumpeter,” and
low away lustily for themselves. Some of our greatest politicians,
patriots, doctors, tragedians, and tight-rope dancers are already
members of the above Society, and the numbers are increasing daily.

JONES BAYS THE “MOON.”
ONE Jon Es, at the election of the new LoRD MAYOR-(and the LoRD
MAYOR’s Dinner is now become removable into a Jewish Feast)—
opposed the resolution of thanks to LoRD MAYok Moon, inasmuch as
he “had not sufficiently encouraged Art and Science by inviting
members of the various City Guilds to partake of the hospitalities of the
Mansion House.” This is, no doubt, a serious charge: heavy as the
MaroR's mace; but, tell us, Jones, where are Art and Science in
civic guilds? Where do they, unlike the noses of the liverymen, blush
unseen-where, unlike the turtle, do they waste their sweetness? Is
there a CHANTREY among the Spectacle-makers, a CLARKSON STANFIELD
in the º of the Fishmongers? Does another author of another Cal-
culating-Machine glorify the Goldsmiths? ...The Art and Science of
the City Guilds might have been very effectively represented by Gog
and MAGog; but them, in defence of LoRD MAYok Moon, it must be
confessed, they are somewhat above the ordinary dimensions of the
most elevated, diners-out; whilst, as they have not been provided
with hinges, they could have hardly stretched their legs under the
civic *:::::::
We think One Jones has with the very worst grace bayed our Moon.
We firmly believe, that when the eventful civic year of 1854-5 shall be
written in a pomp and manner worthy of its events, that the mayoralty
of Moon will shine like his gold plate, will abound with cordial sweet-
ness, like his own loving-cup. The greater, too, is the credit of Moon;
inasmuch as though it was his fortune to cross twice to Paris, and
twice to come within the cold, shady influence of LoRD CowLEY, our
English Ambassador who keeps continual fast in the Rue St. Honoré,
—his Lordship each time returned to town as genial and as ripe as ever;
eventriper, like a travelled pine-apple.
Having alluded to LORD CowLEY, it will be only humane in Mr. Punch
to warn his fellow-countrymen against the savageness of a French
mastiff, who, in his Lordship's service, receives passports from timid
travellers, to be viséd, &c. §: We have heard that there are no less
than six Englishmen at the present hour lamed for life, having been
wantonly bitten in the calf of the leg by the mastiff aforesaid. LoRD
CowLEY, with only £8,000 a-year, and no dinners to give, may not be
able to afford to . a gentleman to do the passport duty of his office;
but, at least, he might employ a well-mannered Christian. Or at the
worst, if his Lordship will not, or cannot part with his present growling,
snarling official, he might humanely cause something like the following
notice to be painted up in the office below.—“Persons coming here on
business are requested to beware of the dog.”
UN-FASHIONABLE MOVEMENTS IN BRIGHTON.
MR. and MRs., Jones and family have left the Bedford Hotel—at
the door of which they stopped to inquire the prices—and then pro-
ceeded in the direction of the Railway.
MRs. PoppleKINs has not quitted her apartment in Brunswick
Terrace. She has torn up the notice to quit; and tells the landlord to
“do his best and do his worst.”
The MARQUIs PoliGLOTTO, a Polish nobleman, has visited several of
the tradesmen of the town, to whom he has given large orders, none
of which are likely to be executed.
MR, and MRS. Roley Poley have taken the whole of the back por-
tion of the third-floor of a house in the neighbourhood of Regency
Square. Their stay will be limited.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A BATCH OF ADVERTISEMENTS.
EW more amusing articles have
appeared in the Quarterly Re-
view than a recent one on the
subject of Advertisements, past
as well as present, and every
day affords such a choice of
materials, that another article
as interesting as that to which
we, allude , might already be
written. As our voluminous
contemporary cannot devote
much less than some forty or
fifty pages to any topic (though
we might dispose of it in about
half that number of lines), it is
not probable that the Quarterly
will within the present century
give another article on Adver-
tisements. The subject, how-
ever, is too good to be allowed
to drop, and we shall therefore
continue to take it up and let
it º as our humour prompts
us, and as the theme may
appear to be one that requires
dropping or dealing with. The
- - - - - - - Times of Wednesday, the 3rd,
is rich in curiosities of the second column. Among others, is an
invitation to a gentleman, late of Kennington,” who is requested to
“oblige a well-wisher,” by “leaving his papers at-Chancery Lane;” a
recommendation which looks very like the commencement of a law-
suit. How any well-wisher can ask, anybody to leave papers in
Chancery Lane is a puzzle to us, but the mystery is perhaps capable of
solution. , True friendship would, in our opinion, rather suggest the
committal of one's papers to the bottom of the Thames, than propose
their being left in Chancery Lane, for we should expect them to go off
by a sort of spontaneous combustion into a Chancery suit, if we were to
leave them in such a dangerous locality.
The next advertisement is a º of the offer of five pounds—to
which we have already alluded—for the “loud and 'extravagant talker
addicted to drink,” who has “lost his right eye,” and was “last seen at
Sheffield.” It is possible that he has by this time lost his other eye, or
become otherwise so mutilated as not to be known to others, while it is
obvious that he occasionally （fºlimºl, and thus the probability is,
that he will never be discovered.
A little further on, we find the following interesting announcement:—
A LADY LOST A PAPER, on Saturday last, in an omnibus, near the
Bank; a Gentleman spoke to her respecting a scarf she wore, saying he had thirty
tenants who made such; will he, if he saw the paper, kindly write to A. B., &c., &c.?
This gives an insight into what may be called omnibus life, and
affords a glance at the habits and manners, the conversations and
opinions, of travellers by those useful vehicles. A gentleman speaks to
a lady about her scarf, and §§es into a description of the occupations
of his numerous tenantry. The lady seems to have picked up some-
thing that dropped from the conversation of the gentleman, who it is
delicately hinted may have º: up something that dropped from the
hands of the lady. This º e of thing may come under the denomination
of “give and take,” but when the thing given is gratuitous information
about one's tenantry and the article taken is “a paper,” there may be
an inequality in the exchange, which on one side mi º: beinconvenient.
We shall wind up for the present with a lamentable instance of error
which seems to have occurred recently in the neighbourhood of London.
AME ASTRAY, A DONKEY. The owner can have the same by
paying the expenses. Apply to John LAMRERT, 27, Norland-road, Notting-hill.
If not claimed within seven days, will be sold to pay the expenses.
Considering the number of donkeys that daily go astray, it is for-
tunate for the errant ass who is aboveNº. that he has fallen into
such considerate hands as those of MR. John LAMBERT. It is not
everybody who would trouble himself about a poor creature who has
been such a thorough donkey as to go tº. and indeed it is not every
donkey in that predicament who would be kept for even seven days on
the possibility of his being of sufficient worth to pay his expenses for
that limited period.
The Belle-Isle Nuisance.
WE have lately seen a 'good deal of correspondence in the News-
papers on the subject of the Belle-Isle Nuisance, but we have been
reluctant to go very deeply into a matter which everybody seems to
view with disgust. We were not aware that the suburbs of London
possessed an Isola Bella, and we can only regret, that a place with so
taking a title should have got itself into j odour.
THE PEACE-MONGER'S PEACE.
WE hope that no Peace-at-any-Price man will be allowed to have
anything to do with any Peace that may be entered into with Russi
else the following will be about the Price that England will be calle
upon to pay for it:—
. To surrender possession of the Crimea, and to rebuild Sebastopol as
it formerly existed. -
| To provide Russia with another fleet, in every way as good as the
one that was sunk at Sebastopol. -
To make, good Bomarsund, Sweaborg, and Kerteh, and to repair
generally all the damage that has been committed, either in the Baltic,
or the Black Sea, or the Sea of Azoff.
To pay Russia an indemnity (hereafter to be calculated by MEssrs.
BRIGHT, GLADSTONE, COBDEN, and SIDNEY HERBERT) for all the
expenses of the War.
And further:
That the PRINCE of WALEs be sent to St. Petersburg, as a hostage,
until such indemnity be paid.
|
The above would be, probably, the principal items of the Peace Price,
|but there would be smaller disbursements, of course. For instance,
England would pledge herself to guarantee:
That all HER MAJESTY's inferior Ministers should be tried before a
Russian and Manchester jury for high treason. - - -
That LoRD PALMERSTON should be sent (without trial) to Siberia.
That LoRD PANMURE, or MR. Roebuck, or PRINCE ALBERT, should,
with a lighted candle in his hand (such candle to be made of the finest
Russian tallow), do public penance before the statue of PETER THE
GREAT, and, in the name of England, beg pardon of the EMPEROR for
having dared to wage war against the Autocrat.
That the swords of GENERAL SIMPson, LoRD RAGLAN, SIR CHARLEs
NAPIER, SIR EDMUND lyons, SIR DE LACY Evans, LoRD CARDIGAN,
and others, too numerous and insignificant to mention, should be sur-
rendered up, in order to be laid as trophies upon the tomb of St.
NICHOLAs THE GREAT, implying thereby the penitence of the owners
that they had ever drawn them against such a holy martyr. -
That every gun used in the Crimea or elsewhere against Russia,
be given up for the purpose of erecting out of the metal avotive offering
to §: same blessed martyr. - -
That MR. RQEBUCK's testimonial, be it what it may, be confiscated,
and the proceeds devoted likewise to the same sainted purpose.
And lastly:
That HER MAJESTY's crown jewels, together with the coronets of all
her nobles, be lodged for the next thirty years in the Kremlin at Mos:
cow, as some small security that England during that period will
maintain peace with Russia.
And further, as a still better security, that during that same period,

inlster.
We do hope, however, that England, anxious as she may be for
Peace, will never consent to §: so exorbitant as the above
Only consider–LoRD John Minister for thirty years!!!
- ROYAL CHAFFING.
WHATEVER may be the merits or demerits of PRINCE FREDERICK
CHARLEs of PRussia, he is evidently a *: or he would never have
“left Berlin on the 18th to compliment the EMPEROR or Russia.” We
should like to have heard a few of the compliments passed on the occa-
sion, though we can imagine the effect they must have produced when
the PRINCE n to compliment the EMPEROR on the state of the War,
and the aspect of affairs, at Sebastopol. If we had just had our house
burned down about our heads, if the servant we had left in charge of it
had run away, and if we had recently lost nearly all our money in amad
speculation, we don't know exactly what we should say to an individual
who came to pay us compliments. Perhaps, if we knew the precise
answer addressed by the EMPEROR of Russia to the compliments of
the PRINCE of PRUssIA, we should have some guide to follow.
Logic of Le Nord.
We really cannot understand the exultation of the French and #.
Journals, and the rejoicings of the respective peoples, not only of those
countries, but of all the other European states, at the result of the late
operations of the Allied Armies at Sebastopol. The one Point of the
celebrated Four, on which Russia held out, was the limitation of her
preponderance in the Black Sea. That point is now disposed of; the
question at present to be determined is, that of the preponderance of
|the Allies themselves in the Black Sea. Thus the tables are completely
turned upon France and England.

THE PHILOSOPHY OF LIGHT.
It was settled that Liverpool should not illuminate on the occasion
of the DUKE or CAMBRIDGE's visit. Many ardent souls were bursting
into light, when suddenly MR. J. R. JEFFREY, in the expansive shape
of a wet blanket, came down upon them, and the nascent fires were put
down. We avow and admire the courage of the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE.
He fought like a trooper at Inkermann; and, doubtless, even as a Royal
Duke, won his after-ease and his round of nobility visits, although
Sebastopol remained to be taken. But wherefore illuminate? If the
English Duke were a Russian DUKE ConstanTINE, a huge offering of
oil and tallow would be only a due sacrifice to the idol. It is otherwise
with our hearty DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE. Let him be highly and fully
feasted; and let all the wind instruments of Liverpool blow till they
crack again on his advent “See the Conqu'ring Hero Comes /* and let the
dear women flutter their cambric, and scatter their roses; let them,
moreover, in their own eyes light up the best Liverpool illumination, to
the great economy of Liverpool gas. -
MR, WET BLANKET JEFFREy talked, it must be confessed, in avery
º way on what he democratically stigmatised as “tom-
foolery!” he, moreover, more than hinted that it would be far better
to expend the £4,000 at least, required for gas, oil and candle," on those
who would be left widows and orphans” by the War. To this senti-
ment there were—could it be doubted 2–"loud cheers.”
Ere the damp periods of the Wet Blanket aforesaid had penetrated
to the skins of the hearers (who finally voted against the illumination),
promises had been received, “when the books were first put round,” to
the extent of about £200. The light was put out in favour of the widow
and orphan # when the “actual cash” that came to hand, “did not
exceed £31° Such is the philosophy of light at Liverpool. And how
should it be otherwise? hen Dot, of the house of DoT, CRoss, and
Co. gives £5 for an illumination, his eyes have the money’s worth. He
sees the brilliancy of his public spirit, the lustre of his citizenship. But
when the £5 is expended in coals and candles for the widow and orphan,
what knows he of the tallow and Wall's-End? They make an illumi-
nation of which he must needs be insensible. DoT, therefore, buttons
| his º and if the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE is not to be illuminated,
neither, shall be the fire-side of the soldier's, widow. . If the Duke

candle.
A PATENT has just
been taken out for an
invention which will
very much increase
the pleasure, and in
the same degree di-
minish the danger of
travelling by railway.
Not only that, but
the excursion of a few
will be rendered con-
ducive to the delight
of the many by this
contrivance.
The railway whistle
has hitherto been a
necessary nuisance.
But what a nuisance!
Ten thousand screech-
owls, as many cats,
and an equal number
of infants in concert,
could hardly make a
more horrible noise.
! It is worse than the
most piercing squall
wherewith an young
lady that couldn't sing
and would sing ever
split our ears at an
evening party.
The invention above
alluded to will substitute railway harmony and railway melody, for railway discord and rail-
It is, in fact, a sort of -
to be connected with the engine, capable either of mechanical performances, or of being
played upon by a competent musician, who will accompany the engineer and stoker for that
Steam Apollonicon;
Besides delighting the ear of the passengers and the public, this instrument will form
an important addition to the present means of making railway signals, -
different intimations by distinct tunes. There is a song called, “Men ºf Action clear the
It will give
way.”, Well, on approaching a station the
Siderodharmonicon—that seems to be a simple
and appropriate name for the instrument—might
play the air of that song. “There’s a goods-
train coming, boys,” would be the unmistakeable
import of an obvious popular air. The approach
of the Parliamentary train might be indicated
by what fast people denominate slow music—
because they cannot discern any other quality in
it than slowness of time; for instance, the
“Dead March in Saul.” A graver occasion
for the performance of that funereal com-
position might be averted by thus playing it in
tlme.
During the whole Royal Progress to Osborne,
Balmoral, or elsewhere, the Siderodharmonicon
might play, “God Sare the Queen,” for the enter-
tainment of HER MAJESTY; thus she would
have music wherever she went.
Old stagers miss and regret the guard of the
ancient coaching days, and his horn. This defi-
ciency, of the iron road, as compared with the
turnpike, will be more than supplied by the
iderodharmonicon.
No doubt this invention will be forthwith
adopted and applied by the Railway Companies,
and they will appoint an able Professor of Music
to travel with every train, and perform appro-
priate airs, at an ample salary; behaving in this
respect with that generosity, liberality, munifi-
cence, and solicitude for the public safety,
accommodation and comfort, for which all their
arrangements are so justly celebrated.
Human Forgiveness.
LET cymics say what they will, Man is not
windictive. Here for years we have been sub-
jected to the daily torture of wearing the Hat,
and we haven’t even preserved the name of the
wretch who invented it !

fore dinner with his dear
little wifey.”
It is about the rarest thing in the world, when a wife is favoured, in
public, with her husband's company, and it would be too bad to deprive
that rarity of one-half its charm by attempting to strip it of its prin-
cipal attraction... An afternoon's walk down Bond Street, or a quiet
saunter whilst dinner is getting ready through the Rue de la Paix,
would be dull, indeed, even in the very finest weather, unless there was
the incentive of a bright new bonnet #. in the distance. It is
the belief of some, that a woman would lose her head sooner than part
with her bonnet! But still the question, remains unanswered, “Do
ladies bet? and what is the nature of their bets?” The latter may
be (for what we know) gloves, or bottles of Eau-de-Cologne, or packets
of pearl-powder, or boxes of bonbons, or pots of pomatum, or night-
º but we strongly suspect they are cups of tea. This is, of course,
only amongst themselves, for with all wagers entered into with gentle-
men, no lady would ever think of demeaning herself by paying her
losses. A bet with a lady is only valid so long as she wins.
We confess the question, even now, remains involved in the greatest
obscurity, and we hope the fritish Association will take it into
consideration at their next meeting. In the meantime, we think it is
satisfactorily proved that, if ladies do indulge in bets, at all events
they never stake bonnets on the issue, as gentlemen stake hats. just
as if a bonnet was not by far too important a thing to be left to the
caprice of a wager! And, besides, where is the lady who would trust
another lady to choose a bonnet for her? or care about choosing a
bonnet at any other shop than her own?
THE LITERARY LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS.

the work, for we cannot see how sixty minutes, spent in the company
of a rather vulgar-looking plant, can afford matter of either an amusing
or instructive character. We would much rather have Fire Minutes
with a Pine-apple, or even A Moment with a Peach, or 4 Quarter of an
Hour with a #: Apricots. The º of flowers is all very well;
but we do not believe.; the biggest hollyhock, or the downiest of
daffodils, can have anything to say for itself that would justify any
reasonable being in, giving up even half an hour to its society. An
Hour with the Hollyhock appears to us, therefore, to promise nothing but
the details of a very dull and unsatisfactory interview. We should have
preferred A Minute with the Mignonette, or Sir Seconds with the Seringa,
or even-though the experience of such things at an evening party is
not very promising-A Quarter of An Hour among the Wallflowers.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BABY SHOWS.-A SEA-SIDE MONSTER.
At the late Baby-show at Withemsea, the sea-bathing place of Hull,
all the visitors were, as a matter of course, canvassed for subscriptions:
in order that the prizes might be equally worthy of the precious child
carrying off the prize and the proud mother carrying the baby. We are
appalled at the capable atrocity of human nature; but we are moralists
satirists, and part journalists, and, at whatever cost of feeling, will
perform, like Cerberus, our triple duty. A hideous old bachelor, with
a face corrugated like a walnut, and a mouth like a tweezer-case (we
forbear to give his name—indeed, it is unnecessary), received, in due
course, a circular soliciting his mite for the triumphant poppet. To this
urbane, and most humanising epistle, the º: monster wrote the
following reply:—
- Griffin Hotel, Sept. —, 1855.
“Sir, I thank heaven, I am sixty-two; and what in a few years ma
be made a show of in what was once domestic and respectable Englan
I am happy to say I am not likely to see. I can understand a lamb;
show, a pig-show, or even a learned pig-show, but why parents should
ask to be rewarded for fine babies, like a couple of mountebanks sending
º the hat for clever tumbling, I am not yet old or wise enough to
earn.
“I see a great many old women about this place; visitors, who I hear
are spinsters, every one of 'em. These women go about with big
round brown flop-hats, to save their skins; just, I suppose, as we cover
up furniture in summer to keep the mahogany from cracking. Now,
Sir, why not make a show of them, and let the oldest that can pass for
the youngest carry off the prize? It might amount to enough to make

THE ROMANCE OF EUCLID.
THE papers informed us the other day, that MR. SYLVESTER, the new
Professor of Mathematics at Woolwich, has “a passionate love for the
Science.”..We do not doubt the Professor's high qualifications, but we
cannot believe that there is anything passionate in the attachment of
this gentleman, or that] he is either sentimental, or what is usually
termed “spooney,” over the pursuit to which he is devoted. If we are
to believe the paragraph alluded to, MR. SYLVESTER, is a sort of
Mathematical Romeo, with one of EUCLID's figures for his Juliet. If
this were the case, he would, of course, be jealous of every other clever
individual who pays attention to the alleged object of his affections;
and no other Professor of Mathematics would be safe in his Chair, if
the assertion of the paragraph-monger were to be credited. If
MR. SylvestER had anything like “a passionate love” for Mathe-
matics, he would be writing odes to Problem 1, or sighing over the
Pons Asinorum, and," pº ºpiº himself, from very senti-
mentalism, over one of its parapets. We, however, believe nothing of
the sort; but we are satisfied that MR. SylvesTER has a sensible regard

WE cannot share the surprise of our contemporaries at the elevation
of certain veterans to the rank of Field-Marshal, for the operation is in
§ uniformity with the system that has generally prevailed at the
War-Office. Age and incapacity are quite as worthy of promotion as
some of the other materials out of which Field-Marshals have been
made; and it may, at all events, be said, in defence of one of the recent
instances of exaltation, that the “party” has a name which entitles
him to the step he has gained; for Cumber-mere is an *. that
may be considered appropriate to a rank, which, from the objects on

ABSURD RUMOUR OF AN APPROACHING MARRIAGE IN
THE HIGHEST LIFE.
THEY say that young PRUssIA our PRINCEss will wed,"
Which shows that we can’t believe half that is said.
What she marry the nephew of CLIcquot the mean!
The friend and ally of the foe of the QUEEN ?
Why, nothing keeps CLICQUoT from standing array'd
Against her in arms, but his being afraid.
His near kinsman the spouse of HER MAJESTY's child!
Pooh l—the notion is monstrous, preposterous, wild.
His nephew her husband!—whilst over his head
Dethronement apparently hangs by a thread.
He is far below zero in Honour’s scale down.
How long with good name lost will he keep his crown?
Suppose his liege subjects made him cut and run,
Would his brother succeed him, or that brother's son?
They’ll bundle the dynasty out, neck and crop,
And set up, most probably, quite a new shop.
Deposed, we shall have him to keep over here,
And find him in brandy, in wine, and in beer; -
And his nephew and bride we should have on our hands,
And to grant them a palace, and money, and lands.
The PRINCEss is—bless her!—scarce fifteen years old;
One summer more even o'er Dinah had roll’d.
To marry so early she can't be inclined;
A suitable Willikins some day she’ll find.
Moreover, in her case, we know very well,
There exist no “stern parients” her hand to compel,
Affording the LAUREATE a theme for a lay,
With a burden of “Teural lal leural li day.”
INK FROM BEER.
MR. PUNCH's admiration of that remarkable paper, the Morning
Advertiser, is not habitually expressed, he hopes, in terms which may be
considered fulsome. But he is bound to say, that the mode in which it
would appear that the journal in question is governed is so preposterous
that much may be excused to the unfortunate executive. The paper is the
property of a set of Licensed Victuallers, who hold periodical meetings,
and thereat discuss, not ... the general management of their organ,
but the merits of the Editor, Writers, and Reporters, and the proceedings
at these meetings are not even kept private, as might be expected from
men of business, but the Witlers’ criticisms on the articles are reported
and published. One Boniface declares that the Editor “draws it a deal
too mild,” and another complains that the editorials are “frothy,” and
that the paper wants “more head to it.” A Witler of practical character
suggested, at the last meeting, that one of the writers should be told to
“leave out some of his poetry,” possibly thinking that the poor quoter
gave unsatisfactory measure. en GRAHAM, GLADSTONE, and HERBERT
retired, and bread became dear, the crisis was discussed as that of the
“Quartern and three Outs,” when the Sewe Bill was debated,
doubts were expressed whether the rate-payers ought to “stand a drain,”
and one day a leader-writer gave awful offence when, in citing from the
Anatomy of Melancholy, he remarked, that there were many objectionable
things to be found in Old Burton. Now this kind of supervision, by
personages whose education has been somewhat “concentrated”
must be peculiarly undesirable. We admit that, fas est ab Host:e
doceri, but doubt whether a Newspaper-writer who understands his
business can be taught much by the Host of a public-house. With-
out the least disrespect to the Witlers, who, no doubt, deserve
all the compliments lavished upon them the other day by MR. Warvey,
and fully subscribing to the truth of that gentleman's tribute to the
“grace and sweetness” of their female relatives, we must think that a
publican knows less about Ink than Beer, and that he had better leave
the management of a Newspaper to those whose business it is to under
stand the subject. We doubt whether even the WARREN,” who kept a
Poet” insisted on mixing blacking with his ink; and we confess that
only one thing surprises us more than this kind of interference with the
legitimate functions of those who, having been chosen considerately,
should be trusted implicitly; and that is, that any English journalist
On recollection,

“Poor Tom's a-cold.”
King Lear, Act iii., Scene 4.
ILLUSTRATIONS OF SUNDAY READING.
To the ARCHIBIshop of CANTERBURY.
My LoRD ARCHBIs Hop,
Excuse my apparent rudeness in not addressing you as the
most Reverend FATHER, &c. I rather think I am prohibited by a very
high Authority from calling you FATHER at all in the spiritual sense.
Certainly, I have not the honour of being MR. SUMNER, fils.
Your Grace—I am not forbidden to apply that title to you, although,
perhaps, your primitive predecessors would have repudiated it for
themselves—is probably aware that a petition has been got up by the
jewellers, goldsmiths, and other trades, praying that the British
useum and National Gallery may be open on Sundays. I respectfully
ask 3. Grace to support the prayer of this petition on the following
unds.
º Grace, as a sound Protestant, must subscribe heartily to the
roposition, that a material body cannot be in two places at once.
W#. therefore, a jeweller, or any other artisan, or indeed, individual,
is engaged in inspecting objects of art and natural history, at the
National Gallery and British Museum, he cannot also be employed in
drinking beer, and smoking tobacco, at the Cat and Fiddle.
A divine, named WATTs, a Doctor of Divinity, has propounded a
dogma which, although the divinity of that Doctor does not on all
ints coincide with that of Doctor SUMNER, your Grace will
oubtless endorse: namely, that the great Enemy of your Grace, and
myself, and all mankind,
– “finds some mischief still
For idle hands to do.”
I invite your Grace seriously to consider, what employment a
journeyman or mechanic of any sort can find for his time between
church hours. Will you say that he ought to be reading the Bible all
day? That would be a new duty, may it please your Grace, for a
common Christian man: a duty not three hundred years' old, whereas
we are now living ANNo Domini 1855. That he should be thus
availing himself of the advantage afforded him by the invention of
printing, and the solicitude of JAMEs. The FIRST, would be ver
desirable, if the occupation were as consistent with his bodily healt
as it would be conducive to his spiritual welfare.
if heread the Book with intelligence. How many working men does
your Grace suppose capable of so reading any, but a very moderate
portion of that Book, on the meaning of which DR. CUMMING and
other Doctors so widely differ? -
Your Grace should not forget that, having heard the text of that
same volume expounded in Church, the working man might, were the
|Gallery and Museum open on Sundays, go and see illustrations of its
narratives at the former institution, and attestations of its authenticity
at the latter. Does any more innocent-may more edifying-occupation
for him occur to your Grace? -
Had he better sit during the intervals of Divine Service twiddling
his thumbs That expedient, certainly, would preclude any mischief
which might result from the idleness of his hands.
Had he better literally observe the Day of Rest by going to sleep?
Your Grace, of course, would consider his making a railway excursion,
or taking a steamboat trip, quite out of the question.
| You could hardly desire that he should walk in the Park, and
countenance and encourage the desecration of the Sabbath on the part
# º: superior classes, by gaping and staring at their equipages and
unkeys.
|. And surely your Grace will not prefer that he should spend his time
in the public house, as he can if he likes, though he cannot spend it
among the biblical pictures, and the scriptural monuments, and the
wonders of creation.
A few policemen might supply the place of the keepers of the
Museum and the Gallery. Or a proper number of guardians might be
appointed, selected from that class of HER MAJESTY's subjects to
which the LoRD MAYork elect belongs, and who observe the Sabbath
according to the written Law of their Lawgiver, and not in a
different, manner and on another day, that other day being prescribed
|by the Tradition which your Grace altogether protests against, but
insists upon in this one instance. The holyday of the keepers would be
preserved by the substitution of the gentlemen in the blue clothes, or
of those with the aquiline noses; Anglican consistency would be
maintained; satisfaction would be given to everybody but the neopha-
risees; a great boon would be conferred on a great many people; muc
less gin, much less beer, and much fewer mechanics would be drunk on
Sunday; and very much pleasure would be afforded to your Grace's
|humble Servant, 33üºC#.
P.S. Don't listen to the dishonest suggestion, that the concession of
any point whatsoever, whether right or wrong, is damaging to clerical
power.
THE DUKE OF SOMERSET-‘‘WHAT DO YOU WANTP*
THE DUKE of SoMERSET has taken the earliest opportunity of cele-
brating his accession to his title, by still further illustrating_that
magnanimous contempt of courtesy that distinguished him as LoRD
SEYMQUR. His Grace, it may be remembered, refused to give security
of voting to tradesmen, because certain dealers adulterated their goods.
If only men of unadulterated gentlemanly habits were admissible to the
House of Lords, where would his Grace be?
The DUKE of SoMERSET’s “What do you want?” to MR. ALFRED,
HAMILTON, the visitor from Totnes, is quite equal in dignity to his
"Get out of that, old woman,” to MRs. ANNEHicks, of the Serpentine,
Hyde Park. They may both, at some long-distant day, make part of
his epitaph. We would further suggest as typical of his Grace, that
the monument should be capped with one of ANNE’s ginger-beer bottles:
an earthy utensil, cold without, bottling mere pop and froth within.
A SLICE OF BULL BEEF.
THE Irish Fº called the Nation, has published a letter which is
truly national. The writer is a MR. ALEXANDER PELIssier, of Mast-
|field, Clonmel, and the object of his communication, says the Dublin
correspondent of the Times,
“Is to prove that there can be nomistake with regard to the Irish descent of the
conqueror of Sebastopol.”
Which fact the Hibernian PELIssie R proves thus:
"The family, he says, is originally Huguenot. Alexandra PELIssure, PETER, and
John, with two sisters, escaping from the persecution, settled in Dublin.”
So that Irish descent is identical with French extraction; and
|PADDywhack Pelissier originally came from France—no doubt with
his coat mately buttoned behind him.
The Sweetest Moment of Friendship.
FRIENDSHIP dearly loves to crack its nut after dinner, more º

VERY garbled letter of RACHEL's has
appeared in the papers. The letter
º; to be a reply to certain of
er fellow-countrymen, who on the
natal day of old chivalrous LAFAY-
ETTE, ingenuously desired the Hebrew
maiden to sing to them, as she had
been wont to sing seven years before,
the Marseillaise at the #. Fran-
çais. Magnificently, too, did she
Čhant that strain-those notes that
have beaten like “the double, double,
double drum” upon the hearts of
generations. She seemed to glide
upon the stage, moving like a snake
erect; and clutching the tricolor
about her, as though in its web were
the charm of her existence, she mut-
teringly chanted that grand air, as
though beneath the doomed thrones
of kings, she sybil-like, chanted their
universal, downfall. Now, such, a
sybil could hardly have written the
letter that JonATHAN has printed in
her name. Punch is fortunate that
he can give the true copy:—
“Dear Countrymen, -It is seven
years since, in public, I sang the
Marseillaise, although daily I sing
it for my own patriotic consolation, Then, DELAMARTINE was thun-
dering, like another MIRABEAU, at the Hôtel de Ville, and the barri-
cades of Paris were not removed. Under those circumstances, a je ne
sais quoi gave me something that resembled a voice. Now, the empire
is K.; and were I to make the least effort to sing the Marseillaise
in New York, I feel that, on my return to Paris, I should be compelled
to sing very small indeed. Remembering what the Marseillaise was,
and as the Ophelia of the divine WILLIAMs says, “seeing what I have
seen, seeing what I see,” I often feel exhausted after thinking of it.
“As a daughter of Israel, I should really fear to do wrong to interests
no other than my own if I were to augment my fatigues.
“You will, I am sure, believe as much as myself in the deep regret
which I feel at this moment—(what I may be permitted by my strength
to do on my next visit events must say)—at not daring to promise what
you wish for me.
“I did love to sing the Marseillaise as much as I now love to play
my finest part in CoRNEILLE, but—but—nous avons changé tout cela.
'est-ce pas ?
“Accept (not the Marseillaise) but the assurance of my distinguished
sentiments;- cº RACHEL.
“P.S. In the home of their adopted country, if I know anything of at
least the hearts of Frenchmen, I must know that the native airs of that
country must by adoption be dear to their bosoms. Hence, it will give
me great pleasure to execute Yankee-Doodle. This beautiful, but
inspiring air, whilst it animates all the emotions that must, ever fire the
American breast, is, nevertheless, I venture to hope, still within the
compass of my voice; or, pardonnez-moi, that je ne sais quoi that
resembles a voice.”
Parliamentary Intelligence.
MR. BERNAL OSBORNE, it is said, is busily engaged in putting the
finishing touches of caustic to a tremendous Philippic e intends
delivering against the Protectionists next season. The speech is the
same that the clever Secretary of the Admiralty had prepared against
the present Ministry just before he accepted office; but it is found that
with a few alterations, and of names principally, the speech will answer
just as well now as then, and that there is no fear of a single “point ’’
being lost to the country.
I don't Believe you, my Boy.
To the category of Old Boys, which used to be limited to Post-boys
and Pot-boys, we must now add the whole tribe of Beggar-boys; for we
perceive that a book has been recently published called the Autobio-
graphy of a Beggar-Boy, comprising his fifty years’ experience... We
have seen Post-boys old enough to have reached their second childhood,
but this, autobiographical Beggar-boy may be said literally to beggar
every other description of boy by the duration of his puerility.

PRIWACY IN SCOTTISH INNS.
THE “Scots wha hae wi' WALLACE bled,” shed their blood in com-
pany with that hero from a strong objection which they entertained to
‘chains and slavery.” . The slavery, however, consisted in forei
domination, and the chains were of alien manufacture; but our Cale-
donian friends now submit to be bound hand and foot by native tyranny
exercised through the Act of a species of busy bailie body. Not that we
mean to say that MR. For BES MACKENZIE is literally a bailie-we
mention this to save him the trouble of writing, perhaps, and informing
us that he is some other kind of Scotch magistrate. This gentleman
appears to have been devoting his energies to the diminution of the
comfort of Scotch inns, as far as comfort is , comprised in toddy.
Such, at least, is the natural inference from a letter signed “Bon A
FIDE,” which lately appeared in the Scotsman, headed “For BEs
MACKENZIE’s Act,” and stating that a respectable tavern-keeper in
Leven had just been fined £15s, with läs. expenses by a bench of
Cupar justices, under the circumstances following:—
“At the last annual fair in Leven, on the 4th July last, a gentleman from Lochgelly
put up at the tavern-keeper's and engaged his bed for the night. Although the even-
ing of the annual fair, the tavern-keeper's house was cleared before eleven o'clock P.M.,
and the traveller from Lochgelly retired to his bedroom, where he was furnished, some
| time before eleven o'clock P.M., with a gill of whisky and cold water. After eleven,
P.M., the police constable demanded admittance, and went through the house. He
found the Lochgelly gentleman in his bed-room with whisky and water on the table,
and reported the case. The tavern-keeper was summoned at the instance of the Super-
intendent of Police, and on the case being called yesterday, he gave the above expla-
nation, and submitted to the Justices whether he had contravened the statute. The
Police Superintendent thereupon rose and stated, that if a drop of whisky was found in
a public-house before a traveller, even in his bed-room, after eleven o'clock at night,
the keeper of the public-house was clearly liable in a penalty under the statute. The
Justices adopted this view, and the tavern-keeper was fined, as already stated, the
Justices warning him to take better care in future., “I am, &c., Bona FIDE.”
When a policeman can walk into a man's bed-room, in order to see
whether or no he is drinking grog at a late hour, without incurring the
peril of being legally kicked out again, the degree of personal liberty,
to which a people amongst whom that possibility exists has descended,
may be iſ'to be low. Are there no ‘; from liability to this
surveillance of the Police? If so, the Highlands will be a very unsuit-
able destination for any tourist wearing petticoats other than tartan,
and reaching, below the knee. Sex constitutes, no exemption, from
being taken ill in the night, and wanting a drop of brandy—or whisky;
It might pay an officious constable in Scotland to watch hotels late of
nights, mark any sudden light º in the window, rush up and
demand entrance, and get considerably bribed for waiving his right of
intrusion into a lady's chamber. HER MAJESTY, on her way to Bal-
moral, if she ever chose to put up for a night at a hotel, may run the
risk of being much incommoded by some over-active and fanati
officer. The happy pairs who leave St. George's, Hanover Square, will
not so often quit #: sacred and fashionable edifice for the vicinity of
Ben Nevis and Loch Lomond, as such beatified parties, used to do
before the Act of this MACKENZIE gave such very extraordinary3.
to constables, in order to check the consumption of the produce of
Islay and Glenlivat.
Dropping a Line.
The clever fellows who undertook to lay down the electric telegraph
for communication between England and America have laid it down so
thoroughly that nobody can get it up again. The whole of the cable
has dropped into the ocean, and the only person who will receive, any
communication through this telegraph is old FATHER NEPTUNE, who is
destined to be literally “troubled with a line,” for a large twisted rope
at the bottom of one's bed must be a source of very considerable
annoyance. -
GREAT BENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY.
A REGULAR Cockney says: “There is certainly one decided advan-
tage that a person derives from living in the country; and that is, it
enables him to wear out his old clothes and boots, and to put on such
...?" shabby things generally as he never could think of wearing in

A Certainty as Safe as the Bank.
A BANK-Note is frequently cut in two, and sent, on different
days through the Post to ensure its safe delivery., And so it is with
Sebastopol; we have already received, one-half, and expect the remit-
tance of the other half by the arrival of the next despatches.
FROM THE HIGHLANDS.

THE PLAYGROUND IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE.
WE do not know which is a greater nuisance, the playing of the
fountains or the playing of the boys, in Trafalgar Square. This locality
is daily the scene of a variety of games in which the passengers reluc-
tantly find themselves implicated; for every moment they are liable to
become involved in the popular diversion of Cat, or the still more
exciting sport of Rounders. Now and then, a quiet pedestrian becomes
the centre of a game at Leap-frog before he is aware of it, and it will
occasionally happen that he is made to serve as “a back” by a string
of promiscuous young blackguards, who in the enthusiasm of the
moment, are going. “over” everything that falls in their way. The
appearance of a Policeman only serves to add variety to the daily sports;
for directly he comes in sight, he acts as a sort of signal for the com-
mencement of a race of the most exciting character, when the whole of
the assembled gamins rush off at a tremendous pace, tumbling over the
parapets, and executing a kind of steeple-chase over old gentlemen and
apple-stalls, ladies and children, anything and everything, in the
direction of St. Martin's Church.
| Since it seems that Trafalgar, Square is to be converted into a play-
| ground for all the tag-raggery of the Metropolis, we can only call upon
the authorities to appoint a ter of the Revels, that there may be
something like order in the conduct of the games. If one of the basins
were to be cleared out, and a Clown to the ring appointed, his facetiae
would be useful in filling up any gap in the entertainments which the

ABOUT the only Education that the State gives its children are the
letters of the Alphabet on the Collars of the Police. Government
doubtlessly imagines that a boy who has gradually worked his way to
the Old Bailey through the letters of the Alphabet is sure in after-life
to mind his letters. Thus, the State shirks its parental duty of Educa-
tion, and the consequence of this neglect is, that so many of the boys

IMMACULATE CANNON.
IT is said that the EMPEROR of THE FRENCH has lately called that
very naughty old boy the Pope to task; and that Pio NoNo, far from
continuing to feel the obligation of French bayonets, has answered in
full pontificalibus. We yet live in hope-we have seen such twirls of
the political teetotum—to see LQUIs NAPOLEoN a very moral imperial
schoolmaster. He has snubbed the Pope, and may yet birch the King
of the Stick himself. In the meanwhile let us live in hope.
If, however, anything could add to the possible ingratitude of a Pope
—if the deepest scarlet could still be dyed a fiercer tint—it is the fact
patent against his Holiness, that the clergy of Paris, -good, obedient
sons !—have taken the Pope's last manufacture of the Immaculate
Conception as joyfully, as huggingly, as your own little girl—parental
reader—would embrace and fondle a doll. Why, it is not generally
known, that Sebastopol has finally succumbed, not to the bombs of the
Allies, but to the flams of the Vatican, Sebastopol, has gone down;
but it, was the wrath of the immaculate Virgin that blew away the
Malakhoff, even as she might have blown away a thistledown in Galilee.
To be sure, she was induced—we may not say bribed—to the act, by
the promise of a handsome present. The Univers, in its triumphant
piety, testifies to the fact:—
“Scarcely had one of our Bishops obtained an assurance that the bronze of the
cannon taken from the enemy should be employed to raise a colossal statue to Notre
Dame de France, when two days after, 4,000 guns fell into our possession.”
The assurance of a few more statues might, haply, leave. Russia
without a single gun. It is the more kind of the immaculate Virgin to
have brought about this victory, seeing that so many heretical allies
were fighting for it. But this may have been vouchsafed as a
merciful inducement. Hence—who knows?—a single piece of brass
ordnance, delivered to us from Russia, may bring over, more of
Belgravia to Rome than twenty WISEMANs'

THE LEAGUE OF CROWNED SAUSAGES.
MR. Punch presents his most abjectly reverential compliments to
the KING of PRussia, and all the rest of the German Sovereigns up-
wards, and hastens to retract every line and syllable which may have
appeared in this work, calculated to give the faintest offence to any one
of the aforesaid Sovereigns, from the pettiest in point of territory, down
to the pettiest in point of character—need he again name the KING of
PRussia?
He hopes that this retractation will be attributed to its proper cause
(conviction that he was wrong in venturing to offer any criticism upon
the conduct of these illustrious personages), and not to the bewilder-
ment of terror, into which he has been thrown by the following
announcement of the intentions of the above-named Sovereigns to
castigate France and England.
In the correspondence of the Press, appeared, on Saturday, this
appalling notification:—
“How do the Germanic Sovereigns propose to combat the rational demands for a
reformed Confederation which shall form a barrier against Russia? Here is the
answer. By forming a league of neutrality, by attempting to induce France and
England, by persuasion, and that failing, by force—this is not said injest—by Force,
to accept such terms of peace as they, the Sovereigns of Prussia and Austria, with the
fº. º shall deem satisfactory, and which shall at the same time repress the
iberalism of Germany.”
“By Force!”. Yes, CLIcquot AND CoMPANY are going to put us
down! And high time, too. Nay, there must be nomistake as to the fact.
The writer of the abovčparagraph adds, that the King of WURTEMBERG
and the KING of PRussia met at Coblentz to establish such a league
as is abovementioned—the Great Sausage League is, we believe, to be
its historical name—and the Party of the Kings, which is self-named
the Parti de la Croiz, has an accredited organ, which puts the threat
in explicit language, and proceeds:-

The League of Kings is to prepare Its sea AND LAND Forces, to in-
timidate the Allies. ń. Great Sausage League will be down upon us
in thunder. Already, the terrible “seaforces” of Prussia are swarming
at Dantzic; the mighty navy of Saxony is crowding the noble sea-port
of Dresden; Wurtemberg, from her ocean towers, is signalling her
ships to come from the uttermost parts of the world; and the #.
naval arsenals of Ratisbon and Munich are alive with the clang of the
shipbuilders of Bavaria. Russia has a fleet in the Black Sea; but the
keels of her German * plough the surface of the deep, and the
sun of the Allies is set. tus make terms—the Sausage League tells
us that we shall “reflect,” but we will not wait disrespectfully to
do that—let us accept “cette Médiation,” and humbly ask what the
League would like us to do?. It is no time to trifle, now. The Baltic
Fleet is coming home, º but what—even if we presumed to
think of resistance—could that do against the navy of Germany?
There was another Sausage e in former days, and for its
exploits, are they not recorded by the faithful historian RABELAis?
The furious Sausages of the Wild Island, incensed at the acts of the
wise and kindly-natured giant PANTAGRUEL, and his friends, determined
to give him battle. It was fearful times for the giant. PANTAGRUEL
was naturally “very much daunted,” for after discerning “an ambus-
cade of squab chitterlings in a thicket,” he beheld seventy-eight
standards advancing with the greasy º “Their order, proud gait,
and resolute body made us judge that they were none of your raw,
paltry links, but old warlike Chitterlings and Sausages, and their right
and left flanks were armed with a great number of forest (proba ly
Black Forest). Puddings.” . But victory is not always to Kings or
Sausages. A legion of cooks was let loose upon the daring League,
and after some slashing and hacking and “slicing of the fat thieves in
twain, the survivors betook themselves to their heels, scampering of
with full speed, as if the Devil had come for them, while a wonderful
shower of Mustard suddenly descended and completed the rout.”
What if it should be thus with the Parti de la Croir—the League of
Kings? There are about seventy-eight standards, in Germany, and
terrible as it may be to the PANTAGRUELIAN Alliance to see them
approaching, and the devices of the Crowned Chitterlings flying in the
air, France and England may yet find artists who, having cooked the
Russian Goose, will not despair of being able to deal with the German
Sausage. Only, instead of Mustard, it is possible that the Anointed
may get Pepper.
“Coalized Kings threaten us,” said DANTON: “we throw at their
feet our gage of battle—the head of a King!” The Allies will not do
this, for several reasons; one being that they would be perplexed to find
a King with a head at this present writing. But if the coalized
Sausages threaten us with their “forces de terre et de mer.” Punch
thinks that—much as he grudges wasting good victuals—he must throw
at CLIcQUoT's feet a pound of the most superior Eppings. Punch
retracts his retractation, and defies even the mighty Armada of Germany,

TAKE CARE OF YOUR COMPLEXIONS I
The processes of gilding gold and painting the lily are becoming
quite surpassed as hyper-superfluities by the means which are adopted
by young ladies now-a-days for protecting their complexions. Some
few seasons since we fancied that the force of preservation could no
further go, when those feminine infernal º: called “uglies”
were invented. But a recent visit to a watering-place (we will not
make, the others envious by specifying which), has completely unde-
ceived us: and although we now imagine that the climax has been
reached, we have still a latent fear that we shall find next year it hasn’t.
Our readers will, however, probably agree with us, that it will require
some ingenuity to increase the methods of º which have
already been adopted, when we tell them that the other day we saw—
or rather we vainly tried our utmost to see—a young lady, who pre-
served at once her complexion and incognito by wearing—
Item. A Round Hat, of the first magnitude: doubled down to eclipse

Item. A Parasol! !!!
And the worst of it is, that very many of these young ladies who
muffle themselves up in this more than Turkish manner (for the
Turkish women do at least, allow their eyes to be looked at), have
nothing to be ashamed of that they should so hide their heads for.
On the contrary, indeed, it is a cruel fact, that the prettiest faces
are in general made the most invisible.
A HANDFUL OF GERMAN SILVER.

away, and now there’s nothing but the dirty cloth left.

sented by:-Sourkrout, Small Beer, and Small Germans.
13. The first step a Prussian takes in public life is the goose-step.
14. If Prussia is an Eagle that has shown the Russian white feather,
Austria is only a paper Kite—a Kite that is only enabled to keep up by
the enormous length of Bills it has tied to its tail.
15. One grain of English Sense is worth a whole bushel of German
Philosophy.
MANAGERIAL DOCILITY.
THE Manager of Drury Lane has set an example, to which we see no
particular objection, except that its adoption might entail some little
inconvenience. Having produced a drama to which one of the critics
takes exceptions, the Wilſ er writes, to the paper in which the stric-
tures º, and states that he will comply with the Critic's wishes,
cut the drama into the number of acts recommended, and otherwise
follow the directions given. We have no doubt that in the present
instance the process will be an improvement. But if dramatic produc-
tions are to be thus dealt with, we think that the Critics ought to meet,
and agree as to what they shall demand of a Manager. Otherwise the
latter may be embarrassed. . One Reviewer may have a pleasant home,
and social habits, and therefore may like short plays, which enable him
to get away early—another may have a controversial wife and declama-
tory offspring, and therefore may desire nine acts and fourteen tableaua
as a justification for the latch-key, and non-domestic oysters. Then
one, being of a kindly and gentle nature, will, as is usually the case,
like murders and all sorts of horrors on the stage, and his contempo-
rary, being of a savage disposition, equally of course *...* elegant
dialogue and repartee, and the Manager may be advised, on the same
morning, to “cut out the brutal scene where the ruffian throws his
mother-in-law and grandmother into the fiery furnace,” and to “excise
the scene where all that snip-snap talk, intended for epigram, interferes
with situations.” . However, so long as Managers, pa, the utmost
attention to everything but the literature of their dramas, the com-
petent critic must do in type what ought to be done by the Reader
to the theatre.

THE AT TITUDE OF PRUSSIA.
E have observed that
“Our own Correspon-
dents” see strange
things. Here for .in-
stance is a picture of the
present attitude of Prus:
sia, which “our own”
avers to have been
drawn by “an eminent
diplomatist,” and, .
have been, exhibited
lately in print at Berlin:
“Prussia in the present
world-crisis is like a noble
animal of the forest, sitting
motionless on its kinder part,
with head erect, showing her
teeth, and with watchful eye,
attacking no one, but ready to
spring on the first, whoever
he may be, that menaces or
irritates her."
Not being much of a
zoological turn, we are
somewhat at a loss to
guess what “noble animal of the forest” is referred to. As far as we can com-
prehend it, the description seems to us to point to something between a mad dog
and a donkey at bray. If, however, we were asked to find a zoological represen-
tative for Prussia, we should say it might be typified in that respect most fitly
§ ºvereign who, according to all accounts, now daily makes a beast of
imself.
In which case the above description might with greater truth to life run thus:
“Clicquot, like a noble animal of the mahogany, sits with fuddled head and bloodshot eye,
attacking no one but the man, whoever he may be, that stops the bottle.”
THE LAMBTON CASTLE BABIES.
WE read in a provincial paper,"
“The young Viscount LAMpton, heir of the EARL of DURRAM, being a twin, is distinguished
from his younger brother, FREDERick WILLIAM, by a blue silk ribbon tied round his right wrist."
This will not do. Emphatically, Mr. Punch, as an adorer of the House of
Lords and the respected aristocracy ſº repeats, this will not do. May he
be permitted to show why? He will put a case without intending the slightest
offence to the EARL or DURHAM, or Wiscount LAMBTON, or the Honour ABLE
FREDERICK WILLIAM LAMBTON, or anybody else; but still a case worthy of
grave consideration.
Mr. Punch knows nothing of the arrangements of Lambton Castle, but he takes
it for granted that the nursery department is confided to the care of a head nurse
of the most exemplary and conscientious character, one whose faith in the mystic
value and influence of primogeniture is worthy of the nurse of an Earl's heir;
one who would shudder at the profanity of a mistake in such a matter... But
suppose—it is almost profane in Mr. Punch to suppose it, but he will patriotically
venture—this nurse should, in carelessness, or in wilfulness, or under the control
of a wicked and democratic husband—privately transfer the blue silk ribbon from
the Wiscount’s little fat creased wrist to FREDERICK's, and this . done in
the secrecy and silence of night, the following morning the brothers should ºf:
places, and the Wiscount's wet nurse should administer to the comforts of the
younger baby, who should thenceforth become “the EARL's heir.” And some
day, -many days to come, we trust, for LORD DURHAM is under thirty, but still
coronets must be transmitted—suppose the wrong, twin should take his place in
the House of Lords, and in the discharge of his function as arbiter of our
destinies, should give the casting vote for an unjust war, or a disgraceful peace,
or against a reform, or in some other way interfere with the history of England–
having no right to do so whatever, and taking his seat only by virtue of nurse's blue
ribbon. This is too dreadful to contemplate, and, we protest against the identity
of one of our hereditary legislators being left to the caprice of a nurse, or to the
security of a little piece of silk. Our constitution in Church and State must not
be left dangling on so frail a support. - -
Mr. Punch would not hurt a fly, far less a baby; but there are stern duties which
he owes to his country, and to his aristocracy; and on behalf of the nation, and
of the House of Lords, he must insist that no time be lost in tattooing an Earl's
coronet (which so nearly resembles the celestial crown, that it is no wonder Earls
are so *:::::: some portion of the Wiscount LAMBton, so that there may be
no mistake hereafter. The process may not be pleasant for the moment, but when
the baby Wiscount can read and comprehend from what Mr. Punch proposes to
save him, his gratitude will be certain. Besides, if he inherit the spirit as well as
the name of his noble grandfather, the first EARL or DURHAM, he will not shrink
from a display of patriotism, even at discomfort to himself. The LORD CHAN-
;” as Speaker of the House of Lords, ought to go down and see the
thing done, and afterwards register in the Lords' Journal an attested copy
of the marks.

greatly addicted to the use of bad language, consisting in answers which
are much more concise than perspicuous, delivered in a rough and rude
tone and manner, to applicants for information which it is their busi-
mess to afford. These brief and brutal replies, moreover, are, in effect,
misdirections as to forms requiring to be filled up, and therefore not

At a recent meeting of the Creditors of PAUL, StrahAN AND Co.,
a º was made and agreed to, that two of the º:

chief has been stolen, shall at once provide for the light-fingered “party.”
and his family, if he happens to have any. We really cannot see why a
bankrupt—and especially a fraudulent one—should continue to be kept
at the expense of his unfortunate Creditors. . If the parties have sym-
pathising friends, let the friends by all means show their sympathy in any
manner they may think fit; but if the ex-bankers are really without the
means of support, the law—we mean the Poor-Law—supplies a refuge.
It may be said, that there is money in hand, but this money no more
belongs to the bankers than does the “swag,” as it is expressively
called, which is found in the possession of W. of thieves who are
detected in the midst of their operations. e can make allowance for
a good deal of human frailty, but we must say that an allowance--of a
pecuniary kind—to PAUL, STRAHAN AND Co. is far beyond the limits
of our rather “enlarged” philanthropy.
NOTES AND QUERIES ON CHANGE.
Is there no law to hang for high treason any person, or persons,
knowingly concerned in negotiating a Russian loan in this country, or
in sending or procuring to be sent pecuniary supplies to the enemy? If
not, why is not Parliament called away at once from the pheasants, and
such a law enacted instantly What can there be more eminently
contraband of war than the sinews of war?
Note, in reference to the question of the gallows: that war is an
exceptional state; and an extreme case demands an extreme remedy.
Af. not a law, not generally desirable, be advantageously intro-
duced on the Stock Exchange—the law, to wit, Transatlantically called
Lynch? Not, to suggest that capital punishment should be inflicted,
might not tar be applied, with feathers, under this law, to all manner of
persons convicted of wilfully spreading false rumours, with a view to
create embarrassment in our national affairs? In, which case, would
not certain Greek Firms assume the very suitable externals which
denote “birds of a feather?”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NITOCRIS AT DRURY LANE.
THE play-bill reading public of the Metropolis, who are versed in the
literature of large type and the poetry of the paste-pot, have for some
time been amused and amazed by a placard issued from Drury Lane,
which throws all previous broadsides into the shade—or, the waste-
paper basket—by its display of learning and mystery. Antiquarian
research has become fashionable among theatrical managers, who
appear to be up to their eyes in the dust of ages; and it will soon
begin to be a question of rivalry as to which theatrical lessee shall be
regarded as the regular dustman of the past, and which theatre shall
be looked upon as the original dust-hole of antiquity.
The play-bill of Drury Lane commences with the announcement of
“an original Egyptian play,” followed by the confession, that “the
early ages of Egypt are lost in dark mystery.” Undaunted by this
obscurity, the management has been groping about in the dark for the
last #. months, aided by the lights of . DENON, FITZBALL
DYKwyNKYN, and HERODoTus. “No research has been too trying’
for the patience and purse of the lessee, who has distributed his agents
and his money over every spot where anything was likely to be ſound
to aid in “reviving the associations of the Pharaonic period.” Every-
thing bearing any pretensions to an Egyptian character has been ran-
sacked, from a coffee-cup to a Colossus, and we dare say that even the
Egyptian Hall, in Piccadilly—where the lessee of Drury Lane recently
exhibited the African Twins—was occupied in the hope that some
Egyptian notions might be got out of it.
After so much expectation had been raised, the house was, naturally
enough, crowded to semi-suffocation, or partial asphyxia, on the
opening night, when the result of so much learning and so vast an
outlay of money was to be presented to the public. To preserve the
antiquity of the whole affair, the writing of the piece had been en-
trusted to the celebrated MR. FitzBALL, one of our oldest dramatists.
The list of characters commenced rather mysteriously with Mes-
phra (King of Egypt), MR, EDGAR, and Tihrak (a young Egyptian,
conquered by Mesphra), MR. BARRY SULLIvaN. This seemed to
us very like Wictoria (Queen of #!") MRs. ANYBODY, and
Jones, (a young Englishman, conquered by Pictoria), MR. Nobody.
If Mesphra went about “conquering” his subjects, his sovereignty
must have been no sinecure, and it must have been rather a relief to
him when, in an early part of the play, he was stretched lifeless on the
stage, pierced—or rather poked—to the waistcoat by a formidable and
rather authentic-looking Egyptian weapon.
We will not go through the whole of the plot, which turns upon the love
of Nitocris for Tihrak, who saved her life—or rather her leg—from the
jaws of a crocodile. While the lady was walking near the Nile, the brute
in question opened his mouth, in the hope that Nitocris would put her
foot in it, when Tihrak turned the animal into a sheath for his scymitar.
Nitoºris becomes Queen, and marries Tihrak, who is, of course, conspired
against, and who, by what is called in the bills “a great effect, intro-
ducing a new electric tinted light, invented by MR. KERR,” overcomes
his enemies. This “effect” is certainly striking, and says a great deal
for the completeness of the water-works of Egypt; for Tihrāk, who is
suddenly elevated from the chair he has just taken to the roof, turns on
the main, and the water is supposed to rush into the Banquet Hall.
The water is, however, of a peculiar kind, for it does not extinguish the
lights, which are seen burning as brilliantly as ever through the
inundation. The conspirators, thinking, perhaps, that they are born to
be either hanged or drowned, quietly ; the latter alternative ; and,
instead of even jumping on to the chairs and tables, or hanging on to the
lofty columns as well as they can, surrender themselves quietly to their
fate, and lie down with a dºgged determination not to struggle, or to
rise even once to the surface. Tihrak having turned on the main to
subdue his enemies, quietly turns it off, that he may have the satisfac-
tion of viewing them grouped together, like so many drowned rats,
under “the new electric tinted light, invented by MR. KERR,” and
contributing greatly to the ghastly appearance of the swamped
conspirators.
Nobody, we believe, claims any literary merit for the piece itself,
which is a mere vehicle—and rather a slow one—for the effects arising
out of it. Some of the incidents were rather dangerously ludicrous,
and the audience appeared to relish the absurd position of a certain
“dark warrior,” who coming in with a “mission” which he might
have easily fulfilled half a dozen times over, if he had proceeded at once
to his work—that of killing Tihrak-became so extremely dilatory over
the business that Tihrak killed him instead, and the “mission” accord-
ingly failed by the dispatch of the missionary.
It must be allowed that the piece is well got up, and does credit to
the liberality of the management. On the first night, the audience
clamoured for a few extra acts that seemed to have been left out, which
proved that the public, when it can’t have too much of a good thing,
will not be satisfied with having too little of a bad one. This remar
refers to the dialogue and not to the accessories of the piece, for the
latter are yery gorgeous, while the former had been very properly cur-
tailed, and the restoration of the missing act is no improvement. It is
;
only just to the lessee to say, that he has done his part well—that he
has engaged the best available performers—including Miss GLYN
who did all she could for an indifferent part, and that he has succeeded
in producing a spectacle, the splendour of which will be sufficiently
attractive to repay much of the outlay that has been bestowed on it.
WHY DON'T NEWSPAPERS GO BY POST P
THE above .."; which is now made on all sides, may perhaps be
*. y the following copy of the last Instructions furnished on
e subject.
Instruction No. 185,990, cancelling Nos. 11, 1002, 3097, 4608, 9751,
and 15,555.
INSTRUCTION TO POSTMASTERs.
It being desirous to check a Ribald Press, by placing every possible
obstacle in the way of transmitting journals, you are hereby ordered to
take that notice as the basis of your dealings with all posted Newspapers.
In answer to any inquiry by the public as to the proper mode of for-
warding any journal, be perfectly civil, and give the most elaborate
instructions, always, however, conveying the impression, that it would
be wiser not to attempt sending the paper at all.
In the event of a journal being sent in a way which palpably violates
the new rules, do not, always detain it. Its exemption under suc
circumstances, will produce imitation, and then a large crop of disputes
and complaints will arise.
If three journals are.." by the same party, all in violation of the
rules, deliver one and detain two. The apparent inconsistency of this
course will create fresh confusion in the public mind.
. When an indignant, recipient who finds his paper inscribed “Not
in accordance with the law,” and himself mulcted in an enormous
postage, comes in to demand explanation, tell him that you cannot
understand the reasoa of the over-charge, but that he had better write
to head-quarters—the utility of this latter process being proverbial.
There is no wish that the transmission of Newspapers should be over-
burdensome to you, and you are at liberty to delay them, should your
own business make it inconvenient for you to forward them until next
Close examination is strictly enjoined, and this cannot be done in a
hurry, nor is it expected that you should sacrifice valuable time to the
urpose. Breakfast and supper offer the best occasions for your looking
over the journals, and gº morning for the weekly press.
Lose no opportunity of abusing the recent alteration and the new
orders, as this will cause additional conviction that the chance of a
Newspaper being delivered is very scanty.
You are aware that the affixed stamp is very liable to be detached in
your letter-box, or if your counter happens to be damp, or if your
thumb should be sticky while sorting. On no account omit to notice
the absence of an affixed stamp.
Act up to the spirit of these instructions, and the present belief of
the public, that the chances are against a Newspaper being delivered,
will become certainty, and the desired effect will be produced.
General Post Office, St. Martin's le Grand.
APPEAL TO THE TRIUMWIRATE.
KossuTH, and MAzzIN1, and LEDRU Rollin,
Why not be content to effect what you can P
You are doing your utmost dissension to sow
In what should be one camp with one common foe.
Why—blindly and doggedly bent on extremes?
Why will you insist on unfeasible schemes?
Accept an instalment, and wait for full pay:
Rome was not built, and will not be freed in a day.
Oh! how can you be such a triad of fools?
You serve the CzAR more than his creatures and tools;
You are three Russian agents—and all we can say
Is—we trust that you are so without Russian pay!
Imperial Small Talk.
THE EMPEROR of Russia is going about º: his readiness to
shed “the last drop of his blood” in defence of his country. ... We have
no doubt that when he makes up his mind, to part with the first drop,
the last will be quite at the service of anybody who chooses to take it.
We suspect, however, that the CzAR has no intention of putting him-
self on tap in the manner proposed, even pour encourager les autres, who
are being hourly drained of all the blood they possess to suit the plea-
sure of their imperial master.

“WHY DON'T YER STAND BY 'IS 'EAD? CAN'T YER SEE THAT THE MISSUS IS NARYOUS?”
UNIFORM FOR ARMY CHAPLAINS.
CoNs|DERABLE scandal having been given by some of the Chaplains
to the forces in the Crimea, through going about in wide-awakes and
wrap-rascals, the military authorities have, we understand, in compliance
with urgent representations from many quarters, issued regulations
assigning to those reverend military gentlemen a distinctive uniform,
whereof the following are the details.
The hat will be of the same material as that worn by the men of
infantry regiments generally. It will be a modification of the shovel-
hat, to which it will be similar in the size, and shape of the brim; for
the rest it will be identical in form with the common soldier's hat.
Thus it will, so to speak, exhibit, in appearance, a combination of the
fire-shovel and the flower-pot. The pompon will, be white. To the
fore part will be affixed a plate of white metal, whereon will be
enamelled, in black, the number of the regiment, under the letters
W.R., surmounted by the ace of clubs. The stock will be made of
leather of considerable stiffness, so as, to give the Clergyman that
character of ºf. which is doubly appropriate to the clerico-
military officer. The colour of the stock will, with the same view to
the Chaplain's two-fold capacity, be white, and also have white leather
bands depending from it in front. The coat will be black, and differ in
cut from the ordinary tunic only in being somewhat longer. It will fit
with a moderate degree of tightness, as a military Chaplain, by appear-
ing too straight-laced, might incur ridicule, and lose his influence.
The epaulettes, facings, and belt will be all white; the collar will be
broidered with lace of the same colour. The trousers will be white
with a black stripe down the outside. - -
The gloves will resemble in form those worn by ancient Bishops, for
example ARCHBishop von EPSTEIN, a cast of whose effigy, representin
the great Bishop crowning several small kings at once with dislocate
hands and arms, may be seen in the German Mediaeval Court at the
Crystal Palace. The colour of old EPstEIN's gloves is violet; that of
these will be lavender, in order that they may not present the appear-
ance of any error of Popery, but, on the contrary, exhibit that of
#. becoming gentlemen who are at oncé'officers in Her
Ajesty's service and champions of Protestantism. -
It is whispered that the hat, if not the whole of the military Chaplain's
orm, has been designed by an illustrious FIELD MARSHAL.
ACCOMMODATION IN GAOL.
The following announcement appears in a daily contemporary:-
“SouTHAMProx New Gaol.—The prisoners at Southampton have been removed to a
new gaol just built in that town. The new gaol will accommodate about 120 prisoners.”
. Accommodate! “It is good,” as Justice Shallow says: “yea, indeed,
is it: good phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable.
Accommodated 1–it comes of accommodo: very good; a good phrase.”
Doubtless, the “phrase,” accommodate, is a very good phrase con-
sidered as a verb, governed by the noun substantive “hotel” in the
nominative case, and governing the like noun “ guests ” in the accusative.
But with “gaol’’ in the former relation, and “prisoner” in the latter,
the “phrase” may, with some show of reason, be considered rather
inappropriate. It is however “commendable” as expressing a fact-
commendable for the merit of truthfulness; and just as “a soldier,” as
Bardolph told Shallow, “is better accommodated than with a wife,” so
is a rogue in gaol better accommodated than with a garret, in which
many an honest hardworking man is incommoded.
HORRIBLE INTENTIONS.
AN Oriental Journalist, desiring to explain the intentions of the
rebels in India, horrifies us with the following information:-
“Their plan was to loot Pikoor, then take Kuddums Saw on their way to Doolean,
after looting, which, they would go up stream, taking everything in their way to
Rajmahal, which they would loot, and then go on to Bhaugulpore.”
This is truly awful. We are as º as we can possibly be; and
we do not believe that our º the slightest idea of the nature of
this “looting” process would add one bit to our terrors. Surely,
MR. VERNoN SMITH must be hurrying to the scene where his subjects
are conducting themselves in such an atrocious manner, and wanting to
play the loot so unseasonably. Will he at once ascertain what they were
going to take KUDDUM's Św for, and whether KUDDUM gave them
leave to take it. Justice ought to be done to the poor man. Alto-
gether, we are very much bewildered, and by no means sure, that the
union between England and the natives of India is so tight, that it
would not bear a little more luting.

:
A SUPERSTITION EXPLODED.
FROM time to time circumstances occur which signally refute popular
superstitions. GoRTschakoff attended the DUKE OF WELLINGTON's
funeral, and employed himself on that occasion. in examining the
soldiers' shoes. All this while the knell was tolling. , Now, the fol.
lowing story is related of GoRTschakoff, in the Times, by “ONE who
stoop. By,'... not at the DUKE's funeral, but at another spectacle in
which the Russian General was concerned :—
“He º to his prisoners on all occasions the alternative of the Russian service
or the kuout. Once a body of 2,000 insurgents were defeated and took refuge in the
Austrian territory. The Austrians disarmed them, and sent them to Gontschakoff.
He gave them the usual choice of entering the Russian ranks; they desperately refused.
It is said that the General was present at the execution that followed. The flogging
lasted many hours; ten died under the lash, seven more yielded after horrible tortures,
and were borne to the hospital. GoRTschakoff stated his determination to go through
the whole number, if the execution lasted a month. The Poles then bowed the head
and were drafted into the Russian legions."
The knell has evidently not the virtue ascribed to it by the old
monks. It tolled at #e DUKE's funeral; nevertheless, PRINCE
GoRTschakoff continued quietly to examine the soldiers' shoes. There
he remained in spite of the knell; he, the ministering spirit of the
demon then incarnate under the name of NICHOLAs. No; the knell
has not the power which the mediaeval friars believed it to have, of
driving away the FIENDs'
BABY SHOW BRUTALITIES.
HE Baby Show abomination, which
had its origin in the vulgar brain
of a greedy American quack, is
making, to the disgrace of some of
the women of England, considerable
progress among us. There was a
recent show at Boston, and another
at Withernsea, of which more pre-
sently. Before us lies an announce-
ment of a third, to be perpetrated
in a suburb, and the walls and
hoards are placarded with invita-
tions to a fourth, to be appropri-
ately held among the beasts at the
Surrey Zoological Gardens.
As no decent woman of any class
would take her infant into a crowd
to be examined, handled, and pinch-
ed, as if it were an animal for sale,
to have it weighed, and its little
bones and muscles commented upon
its fat estimated, and the general
rocess gone through with which
armers and butchers buy and sell
their live stock, Mr. Punch has no hesitation in using language upon
the subject, which he would abstain from employing, were he merely
remonstrating with thoughtless persons. e is perfectly certain
that upon such, women as are not ashamed to assist at these exhibi-
tions, his remarks would be utterly wasted. To the train of coarse
and impure thought, suggestion, and comparison which is generated
at such shows, he need not allude, because the offensiveness of the
original idea is more than sufficient to repel and disgust any true
womanly mind, no matter in what station of life the woman may
move. He addresses himself to the question as one of humanity,
and because he deems it to be a case in which police interference
should take place. The greediness of gain has sometimes, to be
met rather promptly; and here is a very proper occasion for helping
the helpless.
Of the nature of the º excited by these shows, of the treat-
ment to which the unhappy babies are exposed, and of the general
character of the scene, an idea may be formed from the following
account of the proceedings at the Withernsea Show. . .
After describing the crowd and the confusion which prefaced the
examination of the candidates, the reporter says—
“At half-past three the judges entered the building, and the previous quiet of the
scene was changed into bustle and excitement. Nurses and mothers, with babies in
their arms, fought their way through the crowd, and blushed not beneath the fire of jokes.
How all were safely settled without accident we know not. Those who know what it
is to carry a child through a crowd may appreciate the scene. Ultimately the compe-
titors, on the laps of their mothers and nurses, were arranged all round, and in the
centre of the building.”
That such mothers and such nurses should not “blush” beneath “the
fire” of such “jokes” as were likely to be launched on the occasion,
we can well believe—those who did not blush to be there at all had
little to fear for their modesty. The “judges” proceeded to their
examination, and during this,
“Great noise and confusion prevailed, and attempts were frequently made to force
open the front door. At about five o'clock the anxious duties of the judges were com-
# eted, and the children were placed in the orchestra, just in time, as the door was then
orced open, the impatient crowd rushed in, and all order was at an end.”
The bones, and the fat and the weight of the poor little creatures
having been duly tested, the decision as to the quarter in which Provi-
dence had acted most kindly (the profanity of the affair being another
of its amiable features) had to be announced.
“Then the uproar reached its height. The time for sweet simpering to the judges
was past. Tender mothers expanded into viragoes, frantic protestations arose on all
sides; unsuccessful babies were held screaming up at arm's length by the eacited parents,
and a jury was demanded. The uproar, however, became so intense that the promoter
of the display, after handing over the prizes to the parents of the successful competitors,
left Hull without delay, fearing that any longer stay might perchance prove personally
disagreeable.”
(We heartily wish that the “frantic.” women had finished the display
by dragging the fellow through the foulest horse-pond in the neigh-
bourhood, but this par parenthèse.) Such is the treatment to which
the babies, are exposed—a hot crowd, a frightful noise and riot, and
personal ill-treatment. These are the boons proffered to babies by
Baby Shows. - -
A great outcry, with great justice, was made when it was alleged
that the humbler classes were in the habit of enrolling their infants, in
Burial Societies, with the frightful desire to profit by their deaths.
This was a foul libel, upon the mothers of England. But there was
some ground for the charge—the practice, with the alleged object, was
not-is not-unknown, comparatively small as is its extent. And if we
had to investigate the subject of Burial Societies, we should try to
obtain a list of the women who join in Baby Shows...The mother who
would pocket money from the degrading exhibition of her infant's limbs
and proportions might possibly find consolation for its loss in the money
obtained at its death. But with such women if. Punch can hold no
argument—the person to argue with them is the Policeman,
PERSONAL TO OURSELWES.
THE official Gazette of Colombo, º we have some reason to
think may be somewhere Ceylon way, but we do not Pg. to know
more about the Colonies than the late noble Colonial Secretary) has
been forwarded to us, and contains the following announcement:-

By His Excellency's Command,

Mr. Punch is anxious to say, that the gentleman whose appointment
is thus announced is, he has no doubt, a most excellent and respectable
erson; but is no relation, as has been supposed, of Mr. Punch. The
atter is not in the habit of imitating the aristocracy, and quartering his
relatives upon the public. He has, however, every confidence in
MR. KETALABokkE, which he can reasonably repose in an individual of
whom he never before heard in all his life, and trusts that his office
will ; such a sinecure that he will have time to become as punchey as
possible.

“I BEG Your PARDoN, MA’AM, BUT I THINK You DRoPPED THIs?”
GREAT PERAMBULATOR RACES.
(From our Sporting Correspondent.)
THE return of sunshine, during the past week, occasioned a pretty
numerous meeting, on the Gower Street course, on Thursday and
Friday, and some good sport was shown. There was no great punctu-
ality in the attendance of the competitors; but, when they did arrive,
they went to work in good earnest, and, in their sportswomanly
ardour, would not even wait for the course to be cleared. Several
minor events came off, as did the hats and bonnets of the infant riders;
but nothing of much public interest took place until about twelve
o'clock, when the following exciting race was run.
The Pascº as PERAMBULAToB RACE, from the barin front of University College Hospital
to Montague Place. Open to all competitors. The following started:—
MRs. Brown's b. Pretty Pet, 10 months ........................... Sarah.
MRs. ALPhoxso Jones's g. Duck o'Diamonds, 14 year ...... Mary-Jane.
Mrs. Bathsheba's twins, Mosey and Nosey, 9 h Rachel.
MBs. Figgins's b. Only Treasure, 1+ year .. Matilda.
Mrs. DE Buggs's g. Ma's Image, 13 year .. Susan.
MBs. Monrºomency's g. Young Slut, 6 months Sally.
MRs. Wobbleby's b. Blessed Darling, 14 year . Sarah-Ann.
Miss PARCHMENT's Niece Nelly, 2 years ........ . Buckram.
MRs. FITzgingER's b. Take Notice, 8 months. . Eliza.
Mrs. Popple's g. Toddlekins, 1 year.............. . Bella.
Mas. Bloggs's b. Ittle Tootums, 10 months ..................... Laura-Maria.
Of the eleven ten got away, but BELLA's eye was unfortunately
caught by that of a favourite baker, and she was left behind. The ten
kept together so well until past the Hospital that you might have
covered them with a Turkey carpet, but here the laughter of the drivers
and the screeching of the riders began to tell, and the running became
more frantic than precise. At the Torrington Place crossing, Ma's
Image encountered the legs of an Italian, boy, and his images fell all
over the carriage, to the great delight of the inmate; and here too the
Hebrew Twins were beaten off by a stratagem of MATILDA's, who
pretended to drop a halfpenny accidentally, and RAchEL, pulling up º
seize it, lost the race, and indeed her time, for the coin, was a bad one.
The rattle over the stones also proved too much for Duck-o'-
Diamonds, whose convulsive screams caused the º: to inter-
fere, and the field was thus reduced to seven, of whom Young Slut and
Qnly Treasure kept the lead until opposite Chenies Street, where Only
Treasure was thrown out into the gutter, and Blessed Darling took up
the running, collared the Slut, and made capital º until SARAH
ANN, unfortunately looking round to return the wink of a life-guards-
man, drove the carriage up the steps of an eminent medical man who
was at that moment coming out, and the whole party were floored on
the doorstep. The ruck was now but four, Pretty Pet, Wiece Nelly,
Take Notice, and Ittle Tootums, who all dashed past Keppel Street
in fine style, but here BuckRAM lost a shoe, and at the corner,
the owner of Take Notice, who happened to be out for a walk,
and met her infant tearing along at that tremendous pace, stopped
the vehicle, seized the baby, made ELIZA herself take notice on
the spot, and sent her home with a policeman, to have her boxes
searched. The race was now between Pretty Pet and Ittle Tootums
and they ran very hard and even, until Ittle Too/ums, breaking a shawl
knot, rolled out of the garriage; and though LAURA-MARIA, with true
sporting feeling, would not stop, but screeched to somebody to pick
up the pieces, and dashed after Pretty Pet, SARAH's superior Gloucester-
shire wind was too much for her thin-chested London rival, even thus
lightened, and she landed {{ Pet under one of Pickford's railway
wans ſuckii. standing still) at the Montague Place corner of Bedford
Square, in eight minutes eleven seconds from the start.
No casualty of any particular consequence occurred; but we must
advert in terms of censure to the conduct of an elderly gentleman, who
was so incensed at one of the carriages (Young Slut's we believe) run-
ning over both his gouty feet, that he wrote a violent letter in the
Times on Saturday, condemning the perambulator system as a nuisance.
The article is now an institution of the country; and no grumbling old
misobabist can injure it. Let him keep at home. As friends, however,
of popular amusements, we think that it might be well were one side
of a street devoted to these races, while the ordinary traffic went on
upon the other; and we also think that some stringent rule should be
laid down as tº the weight carried. A driver, should, we consider,
stop when the infant is flung out; and an owner ought not to interfere
(as in the case of Take Notice) when a start has once taken place; it is
unfair to the other competitors and to the public. But these are trifles;
and, we are glad to state, that Perambulator Racing is rapidly in:
creasing in popularity; and, though certain selfish and prejudiced
parents set their faces against it, they little know what is done when
their backs are turned. Let them content themselves with looking to
the springs, while we look forward to the next Spring Meeting, which
will be held in Qxford or Regent Street.
. Since our packet was made up we are informed that Only Treasure
is scratched. This we expected—the kerb-stone being a new and rough
9ne. Ittle. Tootums has sustained no injury, except that its nose
being irretrievably damaged, Tootums is scratched too; namely, out of
the will of a rich uncle, who had fancied it like himself. Eliza is at
the station-house.
ADWICE TO ADWERTISING SNOBS.
MANY a useful lesson may be derived from the animals called
lower, but which are not inferior creatures to you. The kite is a
clever bird: learn of the kite. When this knowing bird sees a
partridge with a broken wing, it forthwith swoops down upon the
crippled partridge, and takes a meal out of the victim. As the kite
sweeps the fields with its sharp and long-sighted eyes in search
of wounded game: so do you sweep the column of “Deaths” in the
Newspapers, on the look-out for bereaved relatives. The parties are
stricken and afflicted, and you, kite-like, may pick a profit out of
their sorrow and affliction.
For instance, if you see that a lady has just lost a son—a young
hero who has fallen in action in the Crimea—forthwith. in case that
you are in the furriery line, drop the broken-hearted mother a circular,
K. your “Real Aztec Monkey Furs, particularly adapted for
lourning.” Or, suppose you, are a stonemason, pounce down upon

ADWERTISEMENT.
O RAILWAY DIRECTORS, FATHERS OF FAMILIES, AND
THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL-A new and instructive game for Christmas.
MEssas. FAIRLARN of Fleek Street, beg to announce, that they have lately produced a
most amusing game of chance called “Railway Accidents.” It consists of a board on
which is drawn a miniature railway, with an “up” and a “down” line, and likewise
several branch lines. Each player is furnished with a small railway train, such as an
“express,” a “stopping,” a “goods,” “cattle,” “first,” or “second class,” either on the
“up” or “down" line. Each player is likewise furnished with a “time-table,” which
indicates the times fixed on for the departure of the trains from the various stations
marked on the board. The mode of playing is as follows: Each player having paid a
small sum of money into the “pool,” the train of the first player is started at the time
mentioned in the “time-table.” The time of departure of all the other trains, although
fixed, is in no way regulated by the “time-table," but on the contrary, by the cast of
dice. The great amusement of the game consists in each train endeavouring either to
overtake or to come in collision with the trains of the other players. The train which
arrives at the end of its journey without accident, pays a forfeit to the “pool.”
On the other hand, if a “down” train, for instance, should be so fortunate as to get on
the “up” line and run into an “up" train at full speed, that “down” train wins the
game and clears the “pool.” Various other little accidents incidental to railway
travelling, are introduced and add to the excitement and amusement of the game. For
further particulars, see the printed directions, which may be had, gratis, at every Rail-
way Station in the United Kingdom.

“OUR PARK'S " PARLIAMENT:–PRICE OF BREAD,
A FEw earnest patriots have, for a Sunday or two, returned them-
selves to Hyde Park, as representatives of the wrongs of the people.
Duly contemptuous of all property qualification, they have deemed it
sufficient to feel in its fullest influence the incitement of their mission,
and therefore, like much-moved Quakers, have given tongue simpl
because they could not help it. As it is likely that the Hyde Par
Parliament may, for awhile at least, be prorogued by the police, we
think it the more incumbent upon us to save from oblivion-(putting
them in decent language as in the case with St. Stephen's) the few
remarkable pithy speeches delivered on the passing occasions. At
four o'clock the Park assembled, when a Speaker took one of the
highest trees.
MR. CHIPPs (joiner), believed that the rise in the price of bread was
solely caused by the preposterous number of bakers. The only way to
bring down the loaf would be to hang up a baker. (Cheers.) As
bakers increased, loaves must go up; or otherwise, how were the
bakers, with their º wives and luxurious families to be sup-
ported? . It mattered nothing that we had plentiful harvests: the
greater the growth of wheat, the greater the number of bakers. He
considered bakers to be the poppies among the corn, and did not be-
lieve that the loaf would fall to its natural price, until a baker was given
to the people to be hanged, one at least every morning. (Cheers.)
MR. BLUFF (bellows-mender) said that his friend—for although a
nobleman, he was not proud, and had no objection to call him his
friend;—his friend the MARQUIs of GRANBy, had hit the right nail
upon the head when he declared that the

graph. He thought the same with regard to the dear loaf. When
all the ends of the earth could tell one another the price of corn,
why, of course, all the corndealers and all the bakers would lay their
heads together to keep the figure up. He would say, though he
knew, very well that MR. Chowler would not agree with him—he
would say, cut adrift the telegraph, and the loaf would come down to
its natural obscurity.
MR. CINCINNATUs SMITH º had but one opinion. The price
of bread was kept up by the cakes of the children of the aristocrac
and the muffins and crumpets of the bloated fundholder. There º

two with a twopenny buster hung round his neck was hung up every
morning when the rolls were drawn, bread couldn't but fall, as the
flunkey went up. (Laughter and Cheers.)
MR. DANTON Jones had but one opinion; and, were that opinion

the present price of bread to two things; the visit of the man
Louis-NAPoleoN to England,-and the starched collars and rufflers

tion. The gorging in the City had first created a dearth of corn, and
the collars kept it up.

THE PENITENT'S PROGRESS.
LAs" SIR John SAUL, be-
trayed by the Evil One—
whose name too often
appears in the indict-
ments of the Old Bailey
—forgot the frankin-
cense and manna of
another life, and gave
heed to the flesh-pots
of this valley of tears.
SAUL, in the abstraction
of an uplifted soul,
soared above all mate-
rial bonds; and made
acovenant with himself.
and affliction chasten the proud and worldly-minded, resolved to make
of himself an instrument of chastisement, of the pomps and vanities
of his brethren. No sinner was too rich, scarcely any too poor for the
discipline of his regards. The rich he humbled, and the poor he
flayed; for SAUL, in his Christian love for the heathen had, as we
say, made an especial covenant with SAUL. If he loved the benighted
Carib, still the more dearly did he dote upon SAUI.
SAUL had built unto himself and his poorer friends a tabernacle—
had set up an Ebenezer. And in this tabernacle Saul would, to the
confusion of the scorner, show how the riches of DIVEs might be enjoyed
with the spirit of LAzARUs. And this was the comfortable faith of
all men, when it chanced that, even as the Golden Calf was cast down,
so was SAUL tumbled into the dirt, and all men mocked and made
mouths at him. Of a truth, SAUL was reviled as a hypocriſe and an
abomination: a younger brother of BARABBAs; a despoiler of widows,
and a grinder of the faces of orphans. - -
The goods of SAUL were §§. by the strong hand. His chariots
and his horses, his oxen and his mules, were put up and knocke
down after the manner of Basinghall; and SAUL had no rest for the
sole of his foot, save in a cab or an omnibus. And SAUL's private
tabernacle, the Ebenezer of stone and cedar, was also conveyed away
from SAUI, and also, after the manner of Basinghall, disposed of.
Now SAUL, released from bonds, took heart; and on a certain day
sought the Ebenezer. He entered what was once his pew, and set
himself to work to wail and pray. Now the congregation were scan-
dalised, and the elders, with a strong hand, sought to remove SAUI,
but SAUL would not move a foot. “What!” cried:SAUL, “and is it
thus you would spurn a penitent?” - -
And again SAUL came, and again and again; and still he cried-
“Would you thrust me forth-me, a penitent?”
And the story runs that, after a time—for SAUL was not to be
rebuffed nor downtrodden, he was so strong in his repentance—after
a time, a new and beautiful house rose up in London's city, even, a
house known, as the United Myrrh and Spikemard Bank, with the

A MAIN REASON FOR A MAINE LAW.
We never felt so much inclined to turn Teetotallers as we did after
reading these remarks upon the qualities of Cocculus Indicus, extracted
from hºaring's Practical Therapeutics:–
“The berries are never given internally. The kernels contain a poisonous principle
—picrotorin—the properties of which have been lately examined by DR. GlovER. From
numerous experiments, he concludes that it acts on the spinal cord; that under its use
the animal temperature is much increased. In all animals killed by it he observed
congestion of the base of the brain. From its intoxicating properties it is used for
entrapping game and fish, but animals thus caught are often very dangerous to eat.
Dishonest persons use the extract for adulterating porter.”
The first sentence in this statement appears somewhat difficult to
reconcile with the last: and as it is said subsequently, that “above
2000 cwt. of the drug are imported into England annually, of which
about 1 cwt. is used for medicinal purposes,” we are disposed to
give the writer credence for his last assertion, rather than his first.
We think, however, that the “persons” he refers to, deserve a
stronger epithet than the word “dishonest.” To be asked for porter,
and serve Cocculus Indicus, is something worse, it seems to us, than
giving stones for bread, or wooden knobs for nutmegs. With an eye
to what may happen from it, we think that the transaction may be
called, in the completest meaning of the words, a dead swindle.
If we were writing for the Morning Advertiser, (which, most un-
happily for our credit, we are not) we would endeavour to exercise
its great public influence—that is to say, its great influence with the
“publics,”—in showing that this practice of poisonous adulteration
has not merely a murderous but, commercially considered, a suicidal
tendency.
It is obviously rather a short-sighted policy to endeavour to increase
the profits of one's trade, by killing off one's customers; and surely no
ublican can expect to have a very brisk demand for his porter, when
it is known to be a thorough drug in the market. For ourselves, now
we are so well acquainted with the virtues of Cocculus Indicus, we mean
certainly to adopt all possible precaution to escape being catalogued
among the “animals killed by it :” and, so long as we are in possession
of our sober senses, we will never run the risk of being “entrapped ”
into drinking like a fish, nor in any way made “game” of, through an ex-
hibition in our person of the drug’s “intoxicatin rºperties. Indeed,
we in future never, mean to enter any doubtful “public,” without
asking the landlord for his chemical diploma; and, if he fail to show
one, and, instead, recommends us to “’ave a drop o' porter,’ we will
inform against him for prescribing drugs without authority; and,
perhaps, drag him from his bar to that of the Old Bailey.
A DEFENCE of THE SYSTEM.–Every General ought to be able to
look Death in the face. What, then, more reasonable than to select
for Generals veterans who are at Death's door?

PRAYERS FOR PRISONERS.
Though in conformity with the Church Service by law established,
we are in the habit o º; “for all prisoners, and captives,”
it appears that all prisoners and captives are not allowed the pious
privilege of praying for themselves; or at least they are not permitted
to do so in an audible manner. An exception had, however, been
made in favour of the inmates of the W.t. House of Correc-
tion, who are, nevertheless, to be prohibited from any further extension
of the right of devotional utterance, as we find from the following
extract from a report of a recent meeting of Surrey Magistrates.
The passage, though rather lengthy, is sufficiently remarkable to
warrant our giving it entire :-
“The REv. M.R. KETCH, the chaplain of the Wandsworth House of Correction, in his
report to the Court, stated that the conduct of the prisoners had been generally good,
and he said also that the permission given to them to make the responses in the chapel
at Divine Service had been attended with satisfactory results, and he prayed the court
to sanction their being permitted to sing psalms, as he considered it would be attended
with more effect during the celebration of Divine Service.
“MR. AustiN said, he felt compelled to express his opinion that it would not be
advisable to push the request of the reverend gentleman. The county had been put to
great expense in the erection of this prison upon the silent system, and it was found
that the permission to give the responses had already had the effect of enabling pri-
soners to communicate with each other, and if psalmody were allowed, it would give
greater facilities for this being done. Psalmody, under ordinary circumstances, no
doubt rendered Divine Service more solemn and imposing, but they must not forget
that they were dealing with criminals, and it was a most important object that they
should be prevented from communicating with each other, as, if they did so, all the
expense they had gone to to carry out the silent system would be thrown away.
“Ma. CLARK, as one of the Committee of Visiting Justices who had sanctioned the
prisoners being permitted to give the responses, begged to say that it was only intended
as an experiment; and undoubtedly, if it should turn out that it enabled the prisoners
to hold conversation with each other, it would at once be discontinued. He added that
the Visiting Justices undoubtedly had no idea of sanctioning the introduction of
psalmody among the prisoners.
“The matter was eventually referred back to the Visiting Justices to consider
whether any alteration should be made.”
The chaplain, who Qught to be the best judge in such matters, is so
satisfied with the effect of allowing the F. to join in the
responses, that he wishes them to be allowed to sing psalms; but the
cautious, Magistrates are afraid that the gaol-birds would turn their
...; to an unholy account; or, in other, words, would parody the
psalms for the purpose of communicating with each other.
We confess we have not much apprehension on this subject; for the
keeping up of a conversation through the medium of psalm-singing
would require a considerable, power of improvisation, and a degree 5:
musical ability which the prisoners are not likely to be masters of.
Every psalm would of necessity have to be converted on the moment
into a concerted piece, with original words, or at least into a series of
independent duets or trios; according to the number of prisoners
that might be interested in the musical dialogue. Any attempt to
hold a communication by means of psalms could only be carried out
by a combination of literary and musical talent, which the inmates of a
aol are not likely to possess; and we do not think the chaplain would
ave testified, as he has done, to the satisfactory working of the
system of responses, if he found that they had been travestied into
“the means of communication between the prisoners.”. . -
The Silent System may be all very well; but we think the Magis-
trates are hardly justified in applying it to the performance of Divine
Service, where the members of the congregation are called upon,
according to the rubric, to utter the responses in an audible manner.
Though prisoners must not address each other, it is hard to say that
they É.i. not address the Source from which mercy for all prisoners
and captives is invoked; for if audible prayer is an *: it is One
: Yºh the unfortunate inmates of a gaol should be allowed the
enefit. -
Limited Liability for Noblemen.
SEEING the recent decisions of some of the Country. Justices, we are
disposed to imagine that they have got an idea into their heads, that
the Limited Liability Act, of which they may have heard something, is
an act to limit the liability of the higher classes to be punished like
common people for any offences they may have committed. It is diffi-
cult to account in any other way for the mode in which the recent case
of assault at the Windsor theatre was disposed of; for while any ordinary
rufian would have been liable to be committed for trial, Lord ERNEST
WANE TEMPEST seems to have had his liability limited to a fine of five
pounds, which might as well have been five shillings.

children, to set them thumping on the piano, screaming sentimental ballads, and jabbering
bad French, without any remuneration for the
onerous task, beyond the vague prospect of
“advantages offered.” We certainly see some
“advantage” to be gained in such a situation
by the scope it must afford for the exercise of
patience, resignation, self-sacrifice, and a whole
catalogue of other virtues, but the obvious im-
possibility of doing what is required to be un-
dertaken, will prevent any person of real worth
from accepting the situation.
T. Number Two is somewhat more liberal than
T. Number One, for he holds out the temptation
of “laundress's expenses” to a person who is
expected to combine the characters of Compa-
nion, Dress-maker, and Governess. The “Com-
panionship” would probably be the most objec-
tionable part of the work, for one would be natu-
rally anxious to avoid all association with a
“lady” who values the education of her children
at “nothing,” and wishes to make a milliner
of their Governess.
The Times of the 11th contains an advertise-
ment too lengthy to quote in full; but which
demands the services of “a well-educated accom-
plished gentlewoman, not under twenty-one
years of age,” to “train and educate a little
girl,” and “be willing to undertake the entire
charge of her pupil’s wardrobe,” for a salary of
£10 per annum. In addition to her intellectual
and millinery acquirements, the accomplished
gentlewoman is expected “to combine firmness
with gentleness” in her disposition; or, in other
words, she is to unite the strength to execute
her various labours with the softness necessary to
make her satisfied with the shabbiest possible
salary.
If people cannot, or will not, pay a Governess
for the qualities a Governess ought to possess,
they should forego an appendage to their esta-
blishment which is in reality a badge of meanness
and degradation, though employed for the sake
of display, and the Governess is thus the real
“victim to appearances.”

DISCOURAGEMENT OF YOUTHFUL GENIUS.
IT would be unfair to blame the Magistrates who, according to the
Hampshire Independent, adjudicated on the following case the other day
at the Southampton Petty Sessions:—
“UNPLEASANT NAMES.
“HENRY YATEs, a lad, was summoned by JAMEs BRooks, of the Back of the Walls,
for repeatedly annoying him, and calling him, on Sunday last, by the names of ‘cow-
mouth,” “slobberchops,' ‘pig-jobber,’ ‘belcher,’ and “bladder-blower.’
“He was fined 10s. and costs, or fourteen days imprisonment.”
| Certainly the Southampton magistrates cannot be justly found
fault with for passing the above sentence. It seems a heavy one,
erhaps. Ten shillings fine for five abusive names'—that is two shillings
| fine per name, besides costs; amount unknown. A large sum for an
urchin to be amerced in l—but when it is considered that the language
of HENRY YATEs was calculated—highly calculated—to provoke JAMEs
Brooks to a breach of the peace, consisting in the fracture of HENRY
YATEs’s head—for which solution of continuity MR. BRooks would
have incurred a penalty of more than ten' shillings—the judgment of
their Southampton Worships will appear perfectly righteous.
Yet, whilst we concur in the award of the judges, we cannot withhold
our sympathy from the case of the culprit. The juvenile railer was
mulcted for the use of strong expressions, but it is impossible not to
admire that very strength of them to which the fine was proportionate.
How graphic too—“cow-mouth”—“slobber-chops!” We hope the
º Magistrates have not nipped a genius in the bud—a
genius of invective. Surely, if anybody conversant with his country’s
literature had been asked to guess the author of the epithets applied to
MR. BRooks by MASTER YATEs, he would instantly have named the
late WILLIAM CoBBETT. Instruction rather than punishment is
desirable for such an offender as MASTER HENRY YATEs. Were his
matural faculties disciplined and directed by education, he would learn
to substitute refined inuendo for coarse vituperation, to speak cutting
diamonds instead of unpleasant toads and frogs, and desisting from
indulgence in the application of abusive terms, to couch an insult in a
uibble. By fining MASTER WILLIAM YATEs ten shillings and costs
or his untutored and unadorned insolence, who knows that the South-
ampton Magistrates have not spoiled a brilliant wit of the personal
species, and deprived future society of a sparkling ornament in the
shape of a smart utterer of rude things?
PUNCH AT THE PLAY.
The Little Treasure, at the Haymarket, is a little gem; its great
yalue arising from its great purity, its surpassing brightness. Even as
in the fairytale, a whole mansion is to be illuminated by a single jewel
suspended, from the roof, so is a whole household gladdened and
delighted by the one fireside jewel—bright, pure, and on all sides
glancing lustre. The story is full of tender athos, and yet with
merriment in it; a baby’s tear. A few words tell the tale. Husband
and wife have been twelve years separated: the husband claims our
merciful consideration, in virtue, or rather in terror of a mother-in-law.
Though a soldier, it is only needful to look at the adamantine curls of
Mrs. Meddleton—those fireside bolts!—to think somewhat leniently of
the naughtiness of the Colonel. To be sure, Lady Howard seems a
charming woman; but then—with the golden fruit is there not the
mother-in-law dragoness P Now Gertrude, the little treasure, otherwise
the priceless little pearl, learning the cause that separates her parents-
(she has no recollection of her errant father, who ought to be ashamed
of those lodgings in Curzon Street)-determines to bring them
together; and this she does with all the might of gentleness, with

added, “the EMPEROR OF Russia will not visit Odessa.” Haply,
his Imperial Majesty has no taste for fireworks?

CANT AND THE CONJUROR.
MR. PUNCH presents his compliments to the
Governors of the Caledonian Asylum, an
to know what amount of contribution was paid
to their funds by the juggler at the Lyceum for
the loan of the “fourteen orphans in fullScottish
costume,” the orphans whose “fathers have
recently perished while defending Sebastopolº”
| Mr. Punch learns from the printed puff, that the
|juggler himself “who was also attired in the dress
of his native land, the MAcqREGOR tartan–
made a very touching speech concerning them,
which enlisted the entire, sympathy of the
| audience.” It may be all, very proper that
these poor children should be occasionally
regaled with wine and cakes; but, why for the
profit of a jº. should they-like the animals
* at the Park—have their feeding time in public?
§ | The conjuror himself only carries out his trade.
| He, of course, would ply his gilt balls and shuffle
his cards for the penny's-worth in a hospital;
but Mr. Punch must, in conclusion, put it to the
|Governors of the Caledonian Asylum, whether
they do not, at such a time, betray a sacred trust,
when they suffer the orphans of their guardian-
ship to be turned into the ready-money tools of
the mountebank?
IDelicate Attention.
Who says that France and England can be
real Allies P England has thrown down the
gauntlet to France. We have reason to know
that HER MAJESTY has sent over to the EMPEROR
one of her own white kid gloves for tying up the
Tuileries' knocker.
A SCHOOL FOR TIGERS IN THE EAST.
THE following rather alarming account is taken from a daily News-
paper:-
“RAPID DEPopULATION of SINGAPORE BY TIGERs.-Two deaths by tigers every
week (says the Singapore Free Press) are read of in the papers just about as much a
matter of course as the arrival or departure of the P. and O. Company's steamers. It
is notorious that during the last fifteen or twenty years many thousands of men have
lost their lives from this cause. Yet the only measures adopted by Government, so
far as we know, to prevent this enormous sacrifice of life, have been to dig tiger-pits in
various parts of the island (which we are now told did little or no good), and to give
a reward of 100 Company's rupees for every tiger killed on the island. The reward
is, for all practical purposes, ineffective; it ought to be increased to 250 rupees; for the
price of procuring the destruction of one tiger in the jungle of Singapore is a hundred
dollars, and the thing cannot be done for 110 Company's rupees. Such is the position
in which we are now placed.”
If the population of Singapore is really being converted into food for
tigers, and the inhabitants are departing as regularly as the steamers,
it is high time that something should be done to save the remnant of
the populace. Considering that the tigers have evidently got the
upper hand, we think they show a sort of moderation in taking only two
inhabitants per week, and there is consequently no hope of any further
diminution, for it is clear that the brutes are already on what º be
considered low diet. We cannot be surprised at the anxiety of the Editor
of the Singapore Free Press, who may any day be selected as a moiety of
the weekly allowance of the somewhat abstemious tigers, who appear
to be practising the negative virtue of moderation and regular living.
Since the Government will not, or cannot, take the matter up, and put
the tigers down, we would advise the population of Singapore to enter
into an arrangement with the brute-slayer at the . of the Haymarket,
and we have no doubt that MR. CUMMING would be hailed as the
Coming Man, if he were to offer his services.
. The Singapore journalist expresses his fear that the “evil will go on
increasing,”—or in other words, that the population will go on diminish-
ing—and we fully sympathise with his editorial fears; for even should he
be so lucky as to escape till after every other inhabitant is disposed of,
it would be but a sorry consolation to feel oneself constituting the
last mouthful at a feast of tigers. - -
We suspect that our Eastern contemporary is either indulging in a
little romance, or is agitated by fears that have grown up under the
enervating influence of the climate, for we cannot suppose that the
people and the Government are quietly submitting to the gradual con-
sumption of the inhabitants in, the manner described, and our friends
at Singapore will excuse us, therefore, if we have treated somewhat
lightly a subject that we should certainly regard as no joke, if we put
faith in the statements on which we have commented.
COUP D’OEIL EXTRAORDINAIRE.
IT is a foolish motion, that Art languishes while War proceeds. War
developes the resources of Art. A singular proof of this has been
given in the gradual advance of pictorial art in reference to represen-
tations of the scenes in the Crimea. When the struggle began, a few
modest sketches of Russian scenery, and a few barren charts of the
coast, issued, and satisfied the public. But the interest deepened, and
our artists had the benefit of the graphic letters which came streaming
in on all sides, and which enabled them to do wonders in the way of
illustration.
The immense progress which illustrated Art has made is, however,
splendidly shown by the last pictures which have come out de-
picting the fall of Sebastopol. #. is really impossible to have much
more for your money. Never was such a coup d'ail. The stronghold
is in a blaze, while the gallant Allies are respectively attacking Malakhoff

from the same point. , You can also see the Duke of NewcasTLE on
the hill whence he, less happy, could see nothing. You can behold
GoRTSCHAKOFF encouraging his men to run away from the “blood-
stained ruins,” you can see the commanders of the Russian ships sink-

their decks with rage, and ordering bombardments of all kinds. §.

Medals and Clasps.
WE hear much of clasps being given, whereas medals were due, to
the Crimean heroes. The relative value of clasps and medals depends,
let the medals be ever so valuable, very much upon what sort of clasps
the clasps are. There is, for instance, the clasp with which the hero,
on his return from victory, is welcomed by the object of his affections.
This clasp is worth any medal, and we hope it will reward all those who
deserve it, as soon as possible.

THE IDOL-WORSHIP OF THE WHITE NIGGERS.
|, ...WHAT a pity it is that the European peoples do not realise the con-
dition in which they would find themselves if the Russians were to
succeed in the attempt to subjugate them | Could they but imagine
that, they would unite instantly, and form a general coalition against
these ambitious and powerful savages. The superiority of the CzAR's
subjects to those of KING Kossoko may be great, but is only military.
Nor, to judge from some antics of an idolatrous kind in which he has
been lately indulging, does the former potentate appear to be, intellec-
tually and morally, a very much more exalted monarch than the latter.
The following extract from a contemporary exhibits the EMPEROR OF
ALL THE Russias engaged in devotions very closely resembling those
X; are wont to be performed by the dingy sovereigns of Western
rica :-
“A letter from St. Petersburg says that the EMPEROR ALExANDER, in his recent visit
to Moscow, not only went with all the Imperial family to the holy places, temples,
catacombs, and chapels, kissing the relics of the saints, and prostrating themselves
before the altars; but in order to fortify the courage of his army, determined on
carrying to it a relic of St. Sergius, consisting of a painted image of the saint from one
of the sides of his coffin, which is supposed to be of great sanctity and virtue, and which
figured in the wars of the CzARs, MichEL FEodohovich, and PETER THE FIRST, and in
that of Moscow in 1812. On giving up the image to the CzAR, a grand religious cere-
mony took place, and the Metropolitan, in the course of it, made the following solemn
appeal to the Saint:- St. Sergius!—Thou gavest thy blessing to PRINCE DIMITRI, to
the Czars, MichEL, PETER, and ALExANDER—look down favourably on the CzAR,
ALEXANDER Nicola IEvitch, who comes to demand from thee thy holy image, in order
to show it to his Army as the sacred mark of thy prayers of benediction and protection.’
. . . The CzAR, on receiving the image, reverently kissed it.
“The EMPERoR has taken the image in question with him to the south.”
Away CzAR ALEXANDER has gone, with his Fetish; and, perhaps, if
he resolves on perpetrating any wickedness whilst he holds, it in his
keeping, he will, in order that it may not see him, bury it in the
earth, after the manner of one of his royal brethren of the Guinea
Coast uninfluenced by Missionaries. If such is the Sovereign, what
must the subjects be? And these debased and º but for-
#. adorers of ridiculous idols are menacing the civilisation of
urope :
But, some cosmopolitan gentleman will tell us, this is an illiberal and
narrow-minded way of looking at a practice of the Greek Church.
However, Fetishism is Fetishism; though, perhaps, our cosmopolitan
friends would insist on having a large and liberal view taken of that.
If we are ever at peace again with Russia, the gentlemen concerned in
the Birmingham idol trade, who export gods to India, will probably
find an extended market for their manufactures among the natives of
the Autocrat's territory,

is allowed to proceed.
The CzAR may not be accustomed" to sport a footman's gold-laced
hat and a peacock’s feather. His undress may not be a state of half-
nakedness, nor his full costume an old red coat and a pair of striped
cotton drawers. His usual posture, when seated, may not be that of
squatting on his hams. Neigher his Russian MAJESTY, nor his sub-
|jects, may wear rings in their lips; and, finally, we know that their
skins are not black. This is to be lamented; for, if their hides were
sable, the darkness of their exteriors would symbolise their internal
want of light, strike the mind through the eye, and scare all the
civilised races of mankind into a confederacy, resolved to disarm
or destroy them.
Bear and Forbear.
A RECENT paragraph, from a Toronto paper, informs us that a
“struggle with a wounded bear is considered generally hopeless.” If
this is the case, it is, probable that MR. HAMILTON will abandon in
despair his dispute with the DUKE, OF SoMERSET, notwithstanding the
mauling which the latter has experienced.

A CABINET QUESTION.
THE superior sorts of German wines are
called “Cabinet.” We have a shrewd, unchari-
table opinion, that these are the only kinds of
Cabinet that the KING OF PRUssíA ever opens
his mouth at. Thus, when the Court Circular
of Prussia informs us, “His MAJESTY, FRED-
ERICK WILLIAM, attended a Cabinet yesterday
afternoon: ” it simply means that he was present
at a meeting at which none hut the choicest
Cabinet wines were admitted. It is a pity, how-
ever, that the same Court Circular (the Heidel-
berg Ton, filled with Johannisberg, would not
be a bad emblematic Circular for such a Court)
never informs us how many bottles with the
KING's private seal were discussed upon these
august occasions?—and how long his Teetotal
Teutonic Majesty was engaged in discussing
them? Again, there is another great lapsus;
—we are always kept in the dark as to whether
MADAME CLIcQUoT (Meure) is ever present at
these little Cabinet réunions? We fancy that
at a meeting, where the order of the day is the
exclusion of all politics, that her presence would
give cerve and sparkle to many a dull moment.
But, without a doubt, the poor Court Historian
has a difficult task of it. It would be unkind
to wish to increase his perplexities. . . If he were
to publish all the truth, we should be having
into the Royal record:—
“The Cabinet sat for four hours, when it was suddenly
from his chair, and spraining his ancle. His Majesty
received every attention from his Ministers, who even
carried their solicitude so far as to carry their Royal
Master up to bed.”
Spanish Arithmetic.
IN a Spanish paper there is an account of the
execution of twenty-five rebels. The writer de-
clares that “the rebels were all of them taken
out, and shot by fours.” This comes of a nation
never paying its debts;, it inevitably, loses the
knowledge of the first elements of arithmetic.
the above instance, is well enough, but when justice is interlarded with
in Sunderland.
BENCH BUFFOONERIES.
If some of the County Magistrates are deficient in wisdom, they
appear to be making a desperate effort to make up for the deficiency by
a #j. of wit, of which we have been favoured with the following
specimens from the town of Sunderland: -
SUNDERL AND POLICE.
“JAMES FLINN, drawing his knife to stab the officer who was taking him up for
fighting.—All I have to say is, the policeman took me out of my brother's hands. I
was taking the knife out to cut some tobacco.
“P. C. Holmes. There was no tobacco found on him.
“MR. Simpson (one of the Magistrates). You won't baccy us in that manner.
* Fined 40s.”
To our southern apprehensions, this kind of thing seems to want all
the ordinary attributes of humour; but to the northern appetite for
waggery which finds wit in the effete balderdash of. CHRistoph ER
North, whose feeble-minded play on the word “Mulligatawny” has
been seriously cited as a specimen of first-rate facetiousness, it is
possible that the pun of MR. Justice SIMPson on the word “bacey”
may be voraciously devoured. A joke at the end of a sentence, as in
jokes, and the decision is affected by the ribaldry with which the case
is interwoven by the Bench, the matter becomes rather more grave, and
we therefore protest against the mode of proceeding indicated by the
following paragraph:
“BARTHolomew GANLEY, and his wife, MARY, kicking up a shindy in their own
cabin in Church Street.
“BARTH. I believe, Sir, the officer is telling the truth. I've been six or seven years
“MR. Simpsos. How often have you been here?–Only once, Sir, and it was for a
very small thing.
“Mr. SIMPson (to the Mayor). I would let him go, Sir, that's a good character for an
Irishman.
“The MAyon. My brother magistrates think you should get off, as you have behaved
so well previously; you are therefore discharged.
“MR. Simpson. And let it be six or seven years before you come back 1"
humorous the notion, of letting a man off who is charged with one-
offence, because he has been only once previously charged with another,
we cannot recognise the law or the logic, in accordance with which
the arrangement was come to by the Magistrates. The parting advice
of MR. JUSTICE SIMPSON, “Let it be six or seven years before you come
back,” would seem to involve the dictum, that offences committed at
intervals of six or seven years may be committed with impunity.
It is possible that the whole report may be erroneous, and that none
of the waggeries recorded in the extracts we have made were perpe-
trated by the Sunderland Bench, but presuming the facts to be fairly-
stated, we think there is ground for a quo warranto, to know by what
the borough alluded to.

The ingenuity of SoYER makes rations go so far, that one wishes.

the north side of Sebastopol! One more achievement Soy ER has
to perform for the completion of his glory. It is to cook the Russian
eagle, which no doubt he would do beautifully, if we could but catch.

CASUALTIES AT HOME.
Tire Balaklava Railway does not appear to have been so dangerous.
as the trenches, at least, we do not hear that more lives were lost on
the former than in the latter. Railway travelling seems to be better
managed in the Crimea than it is at home.
A Muscovite JERUSALEM.–There is, it is said, a sham Jerusalem
built at Moscow. Very proper. The “mock tomb” exactly harmonises.

mote on a very large scale sound

induced to advance it, he would undertake to pay 5 per cent. interest, to repay the prin-
cipal by instalments in five years, and to give insurances on his life as security in the
event of his decease. He is ready to admit of the fullest inquiry into the circum-

We do not know what may be the advertiser's notion of “Sound

—either moral, social, or commercial—upon which a gentleman of
eminent position has run into debt to the tune of £2000, without the

attribute his difficulties to *:::::: on his own part, and roguery
on the part of others; but with a “large income,” and a “position of
enlinence,” the debts which would be pardonable in early life, cannot
be so indulgently treated. We admire the determined rebuff which the
advertiser is prepared to give to “mere curiosity,” and his resolution
to treat only with one who “sincerely desires to meet the case,” or, in
other words, is prepared to “dub up a couple of thousand pounds
before asking . questions. It is rather difficult to conceive in what
way “our Church” is to profit by getting one of its “eminent” members
out of a pecuniary scrape; and, indeed, it would seem to us that, to
#. the debts of this rather improvident Churchman, would tend to
emoralise the Church, º iving encouragement, to extravagance.
There is some ingenuity in ºft out the double temptation of love
for the Qhurch, and five per cent...interest, which the advertiser
“undertakes to pay,” though he candidly admits that he “cannot offer
what is called legal security.” -
Qf course, therefore, there will be nothing to depend upon, but, the
“Church principles” of the advertiser, and it is not likely that these
principles, judging from the mess their owner has got into, will provide
very efficiently for the payment of the promised interest. Had we the

will possibly reply to it. We foresee a correspondence, in which the
advertiser will be requested to forward his acceptances for £2000, to
some gentleman of a Jewish name, but whose principles are sound
º who has a friend also a high Churchman, who, when quite
satisfied that Church interests will be served, will be ready to advance
the sum required. We can imagine a police case arising out of the
business, when the gentleman of “eminent position” and “Church prin-
ciples” §. chiefly by a white choker) will call upon that
eminent Churchman, MR. Davis LAURENCE, to show cause why he does
not return certain acceptances which sound Čhurchman Number one
entrusted to sound Churchman Number Two, and on which the former
has not received a shilling. If the Church wishes to keep itself out of
danger, we recommend its keeping itself ". free from bill transactions,
even though they be of the tempting kind suggested in the above

It is a º: mistake to suppose that prodigals and spendthrifts aſe
chiefly to be found, amongst the youthful heirs to great estates. The
most extrayagant dog in existence is the Norfolk agricultural labourer.
This assertion we make on the authority of MR.T.G., Tuck, a magis-
trate of that, county. At a meeting of the Blofield and Walsham
Agricultural Association, MR. Tuck is reported to have stated certain
particulars,concerning the Norfolk peasantry, which exhibit them as
accustomed to indulge in reckless profusion to a degree without parallel
in the annals of the Insolvent Court. The cause of their lavish and
profligate conduct is precisely the same as that which has ruined so
many juvenile inheritors of riches—the seeming immensity of their
affluence. These ploughmen and carters are rolling in wealth, amount-
ing in many, instances to 10s. or 12s. a-week; thus overloaded with
abundance, they evince the common weakness of human nature so cir-
cumstanced: and, as MR. Tuck says,
“What was lightly "... was little valued, and this was the case with the
labourers. In the years of 1848 and 1849, when flour was extremely cheap, they did not
care how it was wasted, and he would give an instance of it. He once saw three chil-
aren of one family>in the middle of an afternoon, with a large piece of bread in their
hands, eating some of it, giving some of it to a dog, and throwing the greater part of
it on the road. He rode up to the cottage in which they lived, and asked their mother
why she encouraged such waste in her family? Her answer was, 'Sir, my husband
would be extremely angry with me if I refused these children a piece of bread and
cheese at any hour of the day.’”
This wasteful woman had actually given her children more bread than
they could manage to eat. Of course she might easily have known
how much they absolutely required. The test of their being really
hungry would have been their crying bitterly. She ought not to have
complied with their mere demand for bread. Had she not been utter
devoid of any feeling of frugality, she would have made them wait §
they screamed for it. All that MR. Tuck could get from this dissolute
woman in answer to his remonstrances, was, that “it was very hard to
deny the poor children a piece of bread.” An astounding reply, pro-
bably, to that gentleman who, doubtless, thought that nothing could be
unore . ote, that this instance of profusion occurred to MR. Tuck
not less .."; than once.
MR. Tuck further averred that,
“He knew a gentleman who frequently visited the cottages of the poor, and that
gentleman had told him that he went one Tuesday into a cottage, the occupier of which
had received his wages on the previous Monday, and witnessed such extravagance as
he would not have allowed in his own house. The following Friday he visited the
same house again, and the people were eating dry bread.”
. In eating dry bread, did MR. Tuck mean to say that they were con-
tinuing the course of extravagance, on the Friday, which they had
commenced on the Tuesday? It would be natural to conclude that he
did, as he evidently considers dry bread a thing of which it is possible
for labourers to eat too much; and probably, with wages of even 10s.
or 12s. a-week, they would not, although they had just been paid, have
been so outrageously extravagant as to eat anything better.
To some people, the case last quoted may not seem so strong against
the luxurious Norfolk labourers as that of the children, but it is equally
so ; for eating too much bread is the worst way of wasting it. That
which is given to a dog, nourishes the dog; that which is thrown away
may feed the sparrows; but, that which is unnecessarily swallowed is
wholly useless. If digestible, it goes to form superfluous fat; if
indigestible, it is so much, rubbish, which cannot be shot into any
more unfit receptacle than the stomach. This is said with all deference
to MR. Tuck, who, no doubt, thinks that children ought to tuck all
their bread in.
The Norfolk labourers, by their excessive consumption of bread,
inflict severe suffering on the class of which MR. Tuck is a member.
According to this gentleman :-
“There was a great deal of suffering after the measure for the repeal of the Corn
Laws was passed, and no one knew better than he did that the loss of property was
enormous; but he believed they were suffering still from the repeal of the Corn Laws,
and he would prove it. The repeal of those laws caused such extravagant and uneco-
nomical practices on the part of the labourers that years and years would elapse before
they returned to their förmer habits.”
MR. Tuck, then, related the above quoted anecdotes in proof of the
extravagant and uneconomical practices of the labourers.
Surely, every feeling heart will commiserate MR. Tuck and his
order, on account of the suffering and privation which must have been
entailed upon them, through the loss of Protection, by the labourers'
inordinate indulgence in bread. We dare say that many of them are
actually no longer able, by reason of the scarcity of flour which has
thence arisen, to afford their livery-servants hair powder.
A Hero Actor.
THE conduct of LoRD ERNEST WANE in the Ladies' dressing-rooms
of the Windsor Theatre, proves to demonstration that that very fine
young English gentleman is able at the very shortest notice to act the
|part of Caliban in his own Tempest.

INSPECTION OF FIELD-MARSHALS.
ONE of the most remarkable military ceremonies which we have
lately had the pleasure of recording, took place on Saturday last, at
the tº. Service Institution, in Whitehall Yard, where several
gallant soldiers, officers, and privates, who have distinguished them-
g. in the Crimea, inspected the Field-Marshals in HER MAJESTY's
ervice.
The recently made Field-Marshals arrived punctually in their respec-
tive perambulators, and were received by the attendants with the
utmost kindness and tenderness. They were lifted along the passage,
and placed in three of the easiest chairs which could be procured. The
windows were carefully closed to exclude draughts. - -
While waiting the arrival of the veteran F.M., whose creation, dating
1840, is much older than that of the Peninsular Generals, and to whom
more latitude was therefore very properly allowed, the objects of in-
terest in the Institution were explained to the Marshals. The skeleton
of Marengo, the horse ridden by NAPOLEON, at Waterloo, much
delighted them, as having belonged to an acquaintance of other days,
and GENERAL Woº's Quebec sword recalled to them an event of
their younger lives. -
The other Field-Marshal's carriage was then heard, and presently
H.R.H., entered, in the uniform, which he wore at the taking
of his last quarter's salary. With him came the Colonel of the
Scots Fusilier Guards, the Colonel-in-Chief of the Sixtieth Rifles, the
Grand Ranger of Windsor Park, the Lord-Warden of the Stannaries,
the Chief Steward of the **ś Cornwall, the Governor and Con-
stable of Windsor Castle, the High Steward of Plymouth, the Colonel
of the , Artillery Company, the Chancellor of the University of
Cambridge, and the PRINCE ConsorT. Mr. Punch was also present.
The inspection was then gone through, and the Field-Marshals were
examined as to their efficiency, and their capability of rendering mili-
tary service to HERMAJESTY.. The Peninsular Generals admitted that
their day had gone by; but said that they were delighted to hear that
younger men were appointed to do their work. From motives of deli-
cacy it was thought best not to undeceive them. They were then
asked if they had any complaint to make, and they replied that they
had, that their promotion to the highest rank in ſe Army had either
been earned forty years ago, or not at all; and that both the delay
Which had taken place, and the moment selected for conferring
the honour, were equally unfair. Mr. Punch promised that this
should be motified, and expressed his entire concurrence in their
sentiments.
H.R.H. was then inspected, and was warmly complimented upon
being in such apparently excellent condition. H.R.H. stated that he
was at that moment, quite as fit to discharge the duties of a Field-
Marshal as he ever had been, and that he long, hoped to serve his
Sovereign in that capacity. Although he could not as yet aspire to the
renown of his colleague in honours, F.M. Leopold, KING of THE
BELGIANs, who had received £1,200,000 of the people's money up to
last pay-day, and who therefore was º anxious to negociate a
peace (as such items might in war-time be thought objectionable), he
trusted that he should not be found unworthy of the relationship.
The examination being º: the inspectors departed, with the
single recommendation, that the Field-Marshals, being happily lodged
in a collection of military curiosities, should be kept in what was
evidently their proper place.
BREAD AND STONES.
. CERTAIN patriots, altogether guiltless of their country's good, con-
tinue to meet on Sundays in Hyde Park, to discuss the question of
high H. and believe in their philosophy that the only remedy for
dear bread is in the use of stones. Hence, these worthies fling about
their arguments in a manner, not so much calculated to convince the
heads of their opponents as to split them. We have no doubt that
these patriotic young gentlemen are animated by the best intentions,
and are quite in earnest in their desire to construe the cause of dear
bread. e therefore beg leave to refer them to the EMPEROR OF
Russia: and further propose that a recruiting company should be in
attendance at the Park, in order to enlist the sympathies of the
º young gentlemen to the confusion of the CzAR of the dear
oaf, . As they are so fond of flinging stones, we do, not see why they
#. | nºt be incorporated into a force, to be called “The Heavy
0.001CS.
AMENITIES OF POLITICAL LIFE."
A LApy of the good old Tory School, and closely related to the one
of the old women at the Horse Guards, declares, that “She never can
forgive Nineveh for having discovered MR. LAYARD.”

AN ORTHODOX RUSSIAN LEGEND.
THE following interesting particulars, have reached us
respecting the *. whose aid, combined with that of
ardent spirits, the EMPEROR OF ièussix has put his trust,
and through whose power and might he hopes to conquer.
The image of ST, SERGIUs was prepared by its priests
for presentation to the orthodox Monarch by being freshly
gilt, painted, and illuminated. It was supplied with a new
wig; and some holes, which worms and earwigs had eaten
in certain portions of it, were stopped with putty. Its
fingers and toes were also mended.
hen the Czar worshipped his image, and kissed it, a
wonderful circumstance occurred. The nose of the devout
Monarch turned suddenly red, in consequence of the trans-
ference thereto, on the part of the holy image, of a portion
of #: colour with which its cheek had recently been
painted.
ALEXANDER has made a solemn vow, that he will not
wash that paint from his imperial nose until his pious
troops shall have retaken Sebastopol, and driven back the
Allies into the sea.
The ears of the wooden ST. SERGIUs have been so won-
derfully constructed as to hear; the eyes, as to see; the
nose, as to smell: the Saint enjoys a sniff of incense as
Inuch as lº, could a pinch of snuff. The prodigious
mechanism of the tongue enables it to taste; that of the
hands to feel; and that of the feet to walk: insomuch, that
the holy image will not be carried in the van of the Russian
forces; no doubt being entertained that it will march, and
lead them to victory.
Young Prime Ministers.
It is said that LoRD PALMERSTON has become so sensible
of the necessity of filling all public offices with, at most
middle-aged men that he resolves at the earliest period of
the Session, to lay albill before Parliament, by which no man
shall be permitted, after the present minister, to hold the
post of Premier beyond the : of fifty. LoRD JoHN
RUSSELL will, it is said, earnestly support the principle of
the Bill; moving, however, the following amendment,
namely, that for the present minister, let there also be an
exception in the case of the next Premier who is immedi-
ately to succeed him.
MAUD FOR AGRICULTURAL MEETINGS.

Talk o' prawsperity—pshoo!—what times was there ever wuss

Now arter varty year long we ha’ got to pull up at last, , .
And gie up all them there schemes for the benefit of mankind.

Raisun the price o' carn, costun enarmus loans !

Until we all was like to be choked wi' cotton-twist.

But these here times o' war is bringun our mills the grist.

Behind a counter, mizhurun lengths of tape. -

So is banes and paes, and likewise clover and hay.
Therefore I holds that War is a blessun to the land,
And as to the blessuns o' Pace I takes no account o' they.
EXTRAORDINARY ATTRACTION IN THE QUADRANT.
AMONG the gratuitous exhibitions of London is a spectacle to which the
public is treated in the Quadrant, Regent Street, by the benevolent pro-
º: of a shopfor boots, gloves, and other articles of dress and ornament.
mmediately inside the window of this shop there are to be seen,
throughout the day, not only the gloves, boots, and miscellaneous
§. but also one or two young ladies, busily engaged in needlework.
he establishment bears a name which appears to be a French one:
and may therefore *ś. to some minds, an explanation of the dis-
play in the window. Our Allies entertain an idea that a wife, among
us, is a commodity of traffic; and it may be surmised, that the young
ladies are placed in Monsieu R or MADAME CHOSE's window for the
same purpose as the boots and gloves, namely, for sale. If this is the
Case, #. it had better be indicated by the recognised token of a
halter worn in lieu of a necklace by the goods. A ticket fixed on each
of them, stating their prices, would save much idle and superfluous
inquiry. A notice-card in the window might also mention that there
is a great variety within, if such is, the fact, and the shop is really a
matrimonial emporium and conjugal depôt. ---
The girls, however, who are placed in the very forward, position
above described, do not appear to evince a corresponding character.
Their demeanour is rather confused, and their looks downcast, as if
they were afraid and shamed to lift their eyes; which, certainly, if
they did ever raise them, would meet those of grinning street-boys
. leering fast men about Town. The situation, in fact, to any
modest young woman, must be little preferable to that of a pillory;
and we {. these seamstresses have not been condemned to undergo
such exposure for the crime of want: and that they are not suffering
- 3. servitude under a grinding employer, who compels them to
dge in the capacity of live dummies.
MILITARY THEATRICALs.-We are sure that our readers will be
delighted to learn that the farce of “SIMPson AND Co.” is no longer
to be played in the Crimea.

CHARIVARI. [November 3, 1855.
A LION-HUNTER'S MUSEUM.
HE celebrated Lion-
hunter of Belgravia,
MRs. NIMROD, has
for years past, been
hunting Lions all
over the Metropo-
lis. The trap she
was in the habit of
setting for them was
simply a rose-co-
loured note, baited
with a sandwich and
a cup of weak tea.
These, diluted still
further with a quan-
tity of washy music,
were sufficient to
entrap a Lion, no
matter how savage
in his #. or
easy an empt
; the mane. When
she had caught one,
she would assemble
some three or four
hundred fashionable
º and let him
oose amongst them.
- Her happiness was
unbounded if he roared, let it be ever so gently; but if he happened to bring a long
tail with him, or was attended by a lioness, or some young cubs as ferocious as
himself, then she would retire to bed the happiest of the happy, and dream of her
extended fame as a celebrated Lion-hunter. - -
In the course of her numerous chases, she has collected innumerable trophies
and curiosities. These she has arranged into a Museum, which she intends opening
shortly in º to MR. GoRDON, CUMMING's at the top of the Haymarket.
It will indeed be a rare exhibition, and quite unique of its kind. -
We subjoin a few interesting items, from the valuable Catalogue, which, like
#i. at the BERNAL Osborn E Collection, will be charged not less than five
SIllilungS.
R 1. The celebrated Long-Bow, lately in the possession of the Editor of the Invalide
w886.
2. One of the lashes of the whip with which America intends, one of these days,
to “flog the world.”
5. A false collar, §§ to a distinguished leader of the Irish brigade. Rare.
25. The famous Scotch Mull of LoRD ABERDEEN, whilst he was Minister at
the beginning of the Russian War. - - -
46. The iron ring that fell from the nose of one of the "Ojibbeway chiefs, after
he had been taking a pinch of snuff, offered to him by the Pig-Headed Lady, on the
evening of my celebrated soirée, Juſy 19, 1848. - -
57. The bone of the leg of mutton which BERNARD KAVANAGH, the living
skeleton, devoured at supper on the same occasion. In perfect condition.

marriage.

Mantle.” Very valuable.
: The Pope's Eye, when FATHER NEwMAN went over to Rome to eat his
InuuLOil.
The New Cerberus of Downing Street.
This Cerberus is to have, like MR.'GLApstone's speeches, the usual number of
three heads. One head will have a broad brim, under which you will recognise the
features of a well-known Manchester man; the second † wear a Church of
England beaver, with just a slight turn towards Puseyism; and the third will
be an Asiatic Mystery, buried under a Mosaic tiara of hats, darkening the already
dark physiognomy underneath. This Cerberus, presenting the rare combination of
three heads under five hats, will have around its neck a brass collar, on which you
will be able to read, in half-Roman half-Hebrew characters, “CoALITION.”
NURSERY REIYMES FOR FIELD
MARSHALS.
THE appointment of some persons in a state of second
childhood to the rank of Field-Marshal has suggested the
º of furnishing a few appropriate Nursery Rhymes
to be sung to the venerable military ñº way of
lullaby. It would be cruel to disturb their very tender
ears by...martial strains, and we prefer putting them to
“by by" on their bed of laurels to the tunes which are
usually sung at the side of every respectable cradle.
* Hush-a-by Baby.”
Hush-a-by, Marshal, on the tree top,
When the storm blows the System will rock:
When the shock comes the System will fall;
Down will!come System, Field-Marshal, and all.
“Ticketty, Dicketty, Dock.”
Ticketty, dicketty, dock!
The people know what’s o’clock:
The public will frown,
Routine must go down,
Rieketty, tricketty, dock!
* There was a little Man.”
There was a man of birth,
Of very little worth,
And his cranium was full of lead, lead, lead.
A commission he obtain'd
influence was strain'd,
Till he got to the army's head, head, head.
“Dance a Baby diddy.”
Dance a lordling diddy; .
What shall mammy do wid’ee ?
His frocks he discards,
And into the Guards
Dances the baby diddy.

BEHIND THE SCENES AGAIN. '
A PROVINCIAL Critic, whose lucubrations Punch notices
in one of the journals with which he is favoured, says of a
certain actor, “We must also deprecate his most objection-
able habit of Playing: the pit, and gallery, and sometimes
to the boxes!” In the name of THESPIs, to whom is the
unfortunate man to play ? We almost imº that pit,
gallery, and boxes made up the audience. The Critic was
evidently standing at the wing, and felt insulted that
Hamlet ää not give the audience his mere profile, and play
full face to the visitor who condescended to come round
and look at him. This comes of admitting people behind
the scenes: first a Lord smashes a Manager; then a Critic
º: an Actor. The practice should really be put a
stop to.
The Shepherd of Christchurch.
MR. Brown, the Rector of Christchurch, aided by the
church-wardens, took the łº and aged poor of his parish
—from baby in the lap to the eld of eighty—to the Crystal
Palace on Tuesday,+in all nearly two thousand persons:
This is, indeed, to act the part of a good shepherd, to lead
the weakest and the most helpless of the flock to drink
a fill of enjoyment at the Crystal Fountains. . .

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW MAP OF EUROPE.
A Review Mr. Punch expects shortly to have to write.
HEindefatigable
MR. .
Charing Cross,
has jº pro-
duced a map
of Europe, in
which the alter-
ations,occasion-
ed by recent
revolutions and
dynastic chan-
ges are marked,
and the new
boundaries are
given with
º: precision.
mong the
more important
variations from
the old º are the annexation of the dominions of the late KING
BoMBA to the kingdom of Sardinia, and the substitution of the Roman
Republic for the States of the Church. The fall of the House of Haps-
burgh, and the restoration of Hungary, to its independence have also
occasioned alterations, as, of course, has the cession of the Rhenish
provinces to France. The i. of KING CLICQUoT, and the
elevation of his brother to the throne, as a constitutional monarch, and
the consequent close alliance of Prussia with England (since the brilliant
feat of the Prussian cavalry at the taking of Moscow, they have been
named the Daughter of England's Own) have caused no great change
in the map, except that Prussia has absorbed several of the wretched
little sovereignties in her neighbourhood. Poland now figures as she
did, before 1772; may we hope that she has learned wisdom, and
that her intestine broils will no longer tempt the appetite of aggressors.
The extermination of the Greeks, and the addition of Greece to the
QUEEN OF ENGLAND’s dominions, throws some more red colour into the
Mediterranean, and the Crimea, restored to Turkey, ceases to be yellow,
Russia is strangely shrunk up, and her humiliated and diminished
* is a perpetual caveat against the will of PETER THE
REAT.
The independent provinces, which have arisen where stolen regions
have been wrested from her, are the best guarantees against her ever
in extending herself. The map naturally includes a portion of Asia
Minor, and shows the Pashalic of H. R. H. PRINgE WILLIAMs, Pasha
of Armenia, the protector of the SULTAN's Asiatic dominions, who holds
the province as SAID PASHA at present holds Egypt; a country which,
however, HIS MAJESTY ABDUI, MEDsCHID has some idea of presenting
to QUEEN VICTORIA, as a small token of º: and esteem. We do
not know that there is any other alteration which we need note, as the
conflagration which happily and utterly destroyed Holywell Street and
its contents produced a change which, though great to London, is too
small to be inserted in a map of Éurope. WYLD deserves all
credit for his, &c., &c.
FIELDING ON FIELD-MARSHALS,
It is one of the advantages, of an author who takes nature for his
guide, that what he writes will be as true to-day as it was yesterday,
and as it will be to-morrow. We have been struck with the following
passage in FIELDING, which might have been written to describe the
condition of the heads of our army that have recently served—if that
can be called serving which is of no servicel at all-in the Crimea.
FIELDING certainly hit the right nail, or the right Fº on the head,
for he came down like the right man on the right place, when he wrote
thus on the mental qualifications of those who are sometimes entrusted
with the command of armies.
“Nature (who, as wise men have observed, equips all creatures with what is most
expedient for them) takes a provident care, as she always doth, with those she intends
for encounters, to make the skull three times as thick as those of ordinary men, who
are designed to exercise talents which are vulgarly called rational, and for whom, as
brains are necessary, she is obliged to leave some room for them in the cavity of the
skull: Whereas, those ingredients being entirely useless to persons of the heroic
calling, she hath an opportunity of thickening the Bone, so as to make it less subject
to any impression, or fiable to be cracked or broken; and indeed in some who are pre-
destined to the command of armies and empires, she is supposed sometimes to make
that part perfectly solid.”—Joseph Andrews.
It is clear that heroes with thick heads, and commanders with abun-
dance of bravery and an absence of brains, were quite as familiar to the
imagination of FIELDING as they are unfortunately to our ownexperience.
THE COMING MAN.-GENERAL S-MPs-N.
WYLD, of
A PUZZLE FOR A COUNTRY COUPLE.
In the following advertisement excised from the Salisbury and
Winchester Journal, there is rather more, perhaps, to be understood
than will prove generally intelligible:-
ANTED,--A MAN AND HIS WIFE: the Wife, 80 to 35 years of
age, who has been brought up in a Training School, as MISTRESS of a small
Willage School. The salary £20 a-year, and a comfortable Cot and good Garden.
The Man, if able to work on the Farm, at the usual Farm Labourer's wages, or if
capable of taking care of a Hackney Stable, he might be so employed.
Apply, by paid letter, to J.T., Post Office, Weymouth.
The º: for which the wife is wanted, appears to be that of
filling the situation of mistress in a small village school; but it is by
no means clear that the punctuation of the above announcement can
be depended upon as indicating the meaning of its author, and that all
which that individual intends to express, is not merely the indefinite
requisition of a married person who has been educated as a small
village schoolmistress in a school for training schoolmistresses. That a
salary may consist of £20 a-year is comprehensible enough; but some
little difficulty must be experienced in conceiving how a periodical
payment can include a cottage and a garden.
Considered as the commencing clauses of some imaginable sentence,
there is no great obscurity in the next succession of words, as far as
Stable, “The Man, if able to work on the Farm, at the usual Farm
Labourer's wages, or if capable of taking care of a Hackney Stable,”
might be the subject of a great yariety of verbs, but his case above is
that of an unconnected, nominative. The Man might do something;
what, we are not told; the statement of what he might do is omitted;
but if capable of doing, something else, also unmentioned, it appears
that he might be so employed.
If we suppose that the wife is wanted as the mistress of a school, and
the man to work on the farm, or to take care of a hackney stable,
a question still remains to be decided. What is the connection
between the school on the one hand, and the farm and stable on the
other, rendering it desirable that the parties wanted in reference to
them should be conjugally related to each other?
We should think it would pay country papers to employ somebody to
edit their advertising columns.
LONDON. BELLS.

Those foolish times are pass'd away,

The fact from every steeple knells,
That Pewter Pots are London Bells.

TELLING TRUTHS,
Which much better had never been told at all.
Women are never satisfied. If a man is jealous, they cry
out against his tyranny; if he is not jealous, they complain
of his indifference.
A man ceases to be “a good fellow,” the moment he
refuses to do precisely what other people wish him to do.
Tell a woman that she is a flirt, and she will laugh; that
she is ugly, and she will get angry; but just hint that she
is growing old, and she will never forgive you.
Self-love is Love with two bandages overits’eyes instead
of one.
A man marries generally to leave society—a woman to
enter it. -
Those who live only for appearances generally end in
making one in the Insolvent Court.
Many aman talks with loud complacency about the charm
of his fireside, and yet, let temptation give but the smallest
tap at the door, and he evinces the most wonderful alacrity
in leaving it. -
Satire is a dangerous acid, which none but the most skilful
should presume to manipulate. Many a clumsy hand at it
has been blown to pieces by the explosion of his ownretort.
Rather Late in the Day.
THE LORD MAYoF and the principal Members of the
Corporation of London went on Wednesday, last week in
State to Windsor, to present the QUEEN with a congratu-
latory address upon the fall of Sebastopol.
Considering the length of time which has elapsed since
the event took place, some surprise has been expressed that
the Lord MAYor and Aldermen did not accompany their
address of congratulation on the capture of Sebastopol by
one of condolence with HER MAJESTY on the lamented
demise of her Royal predecessor, ANNE.

NEWSPAPER NOODLEISM.
THE London correspondents of the Liverpool, papers seem to be
lamentably hard up for matter, or they would certainly abstain from the
violations of good taste and common sense, which their communications
occasionally exhibit. London correspondents are not usually remark-
able for delicacy; but if one of them happens to be admitted to a
private party of gentlemen, he must be fearfully “put to it,” indeed,
for the means of supplying his weekly amount of copy, if he avails him.
self of what he picks up over the dinner-table, and converts the little
confidences of social life into newspaper material. Sometimes, when
the whole field of realities, private and personal, as well as public and
political, has been exhausted, the London correspondent resorts to his
imagination to make the food he lives upon. A curious example of this
sort of thing has just been set by a correspondent of a Liverpool journal,
who has taken the forthcoming volumes of MacAULAY's History of
England as a theme for some rather rampant absurdities. He has first
made a guess at the number of copies ordered, and, having got hold of
these, he goes through a series of ridiculous feats of arithmetic and
measurement, of which he gives the results for the entertainment of the
enlightened people of Liverpool. He tells them that if the whole edition of
MACAULAY's England were to be piled up, one book on the top of the other,
a height would be attained equal to that which GARNERIN reached in
his balloon, and that if the volumes were placed in a line, they would
extend from Hyde Park Corner to Hammersmith. Nobody—but the
London correspondent of the Liverpool paper—could have entertained
the absurd idea that MEssRs. LoNGMAN would so, trifle with an
expensive work as to pile it up to the utmost possible height, or lay it
in a long narrow row in the public thoroughfares.
The London correspondent might as well have continued his ridicu-
lous, speculations by suggesting the quantity of butter each volume
would enclose, if torn up, for the use of a London butterman, or
how many trunks the whole edition would furnish with lining. The
same ingenious calculator might, also apply his powers to other
subjects, and give an elaborate table of the number of brandy-balls at
four a penny the Lord CHANCELLOR could purchase with his quarter's
salary, or #. number of times that the CHANCELLOR or THE ExchE-
UER could visit the pit.of the Victoria Theatre with the produce of
the Income Tax.

It has long been the practice of a certain class of housemaids to
assume the dress and even the address of a lady, for who has not been
disgusted by the arrival of letters at his residence, directed to Miss
Sp-and-So, who is called by the knock of the postman from the makin
of the beds, or other household duties. We certainly admire the coo
impudence with which the person in want of a housemaid’s place
adopts the position of “a Lady in want of a re-engagement.” We shall
not be surprised at a stipulation on the part of one of these “lady
housemaids” for the privilege of practising on the piano an hour in the
day, with the allowance of an hour in the evening, to be devoted to
drawing or other accomplishment. Dancing, of course, they manage to
enjoy at the public-houses in the neighbourhood, and social intercourse
is easily attainable on Sundays, when the praiseworthy desire to go to
church affords an opportunity for a soirée at a beer-shop, or some other
equally improving rendezvous.

AN OPINION BACKED BY SOMETHING LIKE AN
AUTHORITY.
“The ‘Times' is quite right in saying they should send Men out,
and not Boys.”
“HOW VERY LIKE SPOONBILL!”
TheRE is not amore foolish fallacy than that which avers that nature
in her boundless variety has made no two objects precisely alike. The
truth is, we are too apt to be too º to nature. Nature is
all very well in her way; but nature, being feminine, is too frequentl
flattered by our ignorance and simplicity. We very much doubt if,
after all, nature is not sometimes a very much oyerrated, female. We
propose to make a short narrative in explosion of the fallacy aforesaid.
We feel, too, that we shall have the sympathy, the consent of our
reader going along with us. . -
MR. SpoonBILL is a distinguished parishioner of Marylebone. He is
in fact a model parishioner. He has upheld all the respectabilities of
life, a moral Atlas. Propriety is his atmosphere. Even as it is said
the white-coated ermine, when one spot of dirt has tainted its snowi.
ness, stops, turns upon its back, and there and then dies—so we believe
would Šroonami cease and determine, as the lawyers say, if brought
into rude and sudden contact with the least possible indecorum.
MR. SPOONBILL is rather a peculiar-looking person: in fact, he has
been called a very odd-looking man; a man not to be easily mistaken.
When nature thought of the ens, the mind of SpoonBILL, she thought
of an earthen vessel of harmonising character wherein to enshrine it.
The mind of SogRATEs in the head of SoCRATEs was, we know, likened
to the precious drug or spice of the apothecary in the pot or jar deco-
rated with the face of a faun or satyr. Well, it is very plain—as we
shall prove—that nature, in the case of śī. two mugs so
alike each other that nature only, it is our belief, could tell the
SPQONBIII, mug from the other vessel belonging to the other party.
: with less faith—faith, did we say?—creed, religion—in the
respectability of SPOONBILL might have been deceived into scandal of
that pure and very upright man. But no: we knew it could not be
SPOONBILL; it was morally impossible; and yet—again and again—
we could not suppress the exclamation—and yet “how very like
SPOONBILL!” - - - - -
SPOON BILL was distinguished for his affection for his country; his
dogged love, -nay, his bull-dogged love for old England. He had
never been to France; and never intended to go. Not he Talk of
the belle alliance, all such fine words wouldn't change one frog into a
nightingale; , He would live and die, and never stir a foot out of the
blessed, tight little island. And yet, with this conviction of the sin-
Perity of SPOONBILL, a few days ago in Paris, turning round the Rue de
la Paix, we came plump upon a man-his 'hat was genuine Parisian
certainly, and there was a day or two’s tendency towards a moustache,
but otherwise, comingd; upon that man-we had hardly breath
enough left to say—“Gracious ! How very like SpoonBILL!”
We went to the Exposition of the Beaux Arts: we could have been
content to winter there. We were in the Belgian Court and—imme-
diately opposite, with eyes nailed to a lorgnette, opposite that most
beautiful Leda was our man of the day before—the man so very like
SPOON BILL! Now, SpoonBILL, as a shareholder of the Crystal Palace
|had it was, his pride to dilate upon it—churned up a very stormy
meeting, and had lost his resolution only by twenty, a resolution that
went to put the Venus de' Medicis into a shawl, and DEBAY's First
Cradle-(who can forget that divine young mother with her dove-like
|babes?)-into a dressing-gown. And here was that man—except with a
|sort of satyr-like leer-that man, before that Leda, so very like
SPOONBILL! -
In the evening, we went-and why not?—to the Bal Mabille. Does
not MRs. BEECHER STOWE say of this place, and there is not a grisette
of Paris who will not agree with her, that it is “a scene where earthli-
|ness is worked up into a style of sublimation the most exquisite con.
|ceivable?”, We repeat it, then: we went to the Bal Mabille, and there
|-he—he who in the morning was fixed by Leda, was whirling away
in the whirlpool of a waltz. (There are not less than four w’s in that
|bit of fine description.) There he was, the moustache still looking up,
|spinning round and round, that man so very like SpoonBILL! Now
SPOONBILL hated, loathed all public dancing.—Had he not, on his side-
board, a salyer, a testimonial subscribed to him by his neighbours for
his successful g sition to a licence for music and dancing for the
Cat-in-Walnut-Shells? Nevertheless—though we thought of the salver,
we could not help saying—“How very like SpoonBILE!”
Another night, and weº; and thought we would take a seat and
take an ice outside the Café Vachette. e turned round and—there
was the man so very like SPOONBILL! So like, and yet so differentſ
The man was stirring hot brandy-and-water, and smoking a vile rank
cigar... Now MR. SPOONBILL is a rigid teetotaller, and has been seen
more than once to weep copious water-drops at the discourses of MR.
Gough the water moralist. Nevertheless, as the man stirred, and
smoked-and that, too, on the public Boulevards, with all the varnished
vice of Paris, all the hollowness of the brass, all the tinkling of the
cymbals, passing and sounding before and round about him—neverthe-
less, we felt a sort of vague terror, as we cried in our inmost soul—
“How very like SpoonBILL!”.
The next day was Sunday. We went to Versailles. The fountains
were to play. The grandes eawºr The crowd was great; the fountains
magnificent. Great was the well-bred admiration of the French. At
the climax, however, I heard an Englishman roar out—and the French
laughed—"Bravo! Capital! Ancore!” It was that man again! Now
the good, gentle, pious SpoonBILL himself had petitioned in favour of
the Beer Bill, º had resolved to support LoRD EBRINGTON again and
again for Marylebone, if only for his lordship's support of that Bill.
SpoonBILL was the darkest of British Sabbatarians; and yet here was
a man on a French Sunday in a French show-palace, roaring and
º and that man—so very like SpoonBILL!
e returned to London with an uneasy sense of *ś We could
not help it: we inquired about SpoonBILL. Surely he had never left
London P Left London! Impossible. MRs. SpoonBILL had been to
Cornwall to see a well-to-do aunt, and how, under such circumstances,
could SPOONBILL leave the house? Both could not be from home at the
same time. -
Unfortunately, however, SpoonBILL had had a fit of the gout, that
had kept him in his bed; but he would not have MRs. SpoonBILI, know
it—no—for that would only shorten the dear soul's holiday with her
aunt.
And yet with a startling fact, or facts, like these staring us in the
face, it is to be expected of us that we are to continue to subscribe to
the fallacy that mature, in her boundless variety, makes no two things
alike... If such were the case, how could that dissolute—for we will call
him dissolute-man in Paris be, we might almost say one and the same
with the punctilious, temperate, pious man in London P. How could
such a roysterer be so very like the respectable SpoonBILLP
A JOKE IN SPITE OF HIS TEETH.
SoME people may imagine that the expression, “mad with the tooth;
ache,” is a mere phrase, but the following joke made by an individual
when suffering under acute pain in one of his molars, affords proof of
the existence of what may be called dental insanity. While rolling
in agony from one side of his bed to the other, this unreasonable being
asked himself in the middle of the night, “What property is a man
likely to come into, if all his lower teeth should become affected?”
The reply was as mad as the questio “About a dozen achers in
Rotten-Row.” Surely this man's, friends must either take out his
teeth, or take out a commission of lunacy.
Cause and Effect.
ThE American publishers lately held a festival in New York.
BRYANT the poet was among the speakers. He said-"When I hear
of a rich bookseller, I know there have been successful authors.” Just
so. Whenever Punch hears of a fat American fox, he knows there have
been English geese with “plenty of meat upon ‘em.”

WHO KILLED COCK ROBIN P
“SIR,--I am no enemy to the Peerage, but rather a well-wisher.
wish every Duke was as valiant and courteous as the DUKE OF
SoMERSET. I am glad there is only one LoRD CLANRICARDE. I for-
give LoRD CARLISIE his diary, and am really glad to know what a first-
class man of the old school can do with his pen, especially when he is
well-conditioned... I do not mean to call the Balaklava charge the
greatest piece of tomfoolery that military annals record, nor do I
altogether adopt the French estimate of the two chief culprits who were
implicated in it. They say, “if such a thing had happened in our
service, one of those officers would have been cashiered, and the other
shot.’ I cannot go that length; the utmost I can allow is that one, and
certainly no matter which, might well have been cashiered, but I cannot
for a moment believe that either was born to be shot. , .
“Thus much in palliation;–on the other hand, I admit frankly that
so many noble lords going out at the beginning of the campaign, with
such a flourish of trumpets, and almost to a man, except poor old Loºp
RAGLAN, that gallant gentleman, sneaking home again on one plea, or
another before winter set in, thus enjoying the advantages and reaping
the honours of war themselves, but leaving its hardships and privations
to be endured by ‘common fellows, bears a very awkward look about
it indeed, and forcibly suggests the trite remark of ‘the least said the
soonest mended.”
“Having thus cleared the way, and proved myself, I hope, an
impartial witness, neither a lord-lover nor a lord-hater, I approach with
more self-possession the great question which heads this article, ‘Who
killed Cock, Robin?’ which every right-minded Englishman will
instantly understand to mean, what is become of LoRD J. Russell?
And, Sir, I ask boldly, what is become of him P Has he been quietly put
out of the way? Has he been made safe? When and where was he last
seen P Was, there any peculiarity in his look, or manner, anything
unusual in his *: Was he well, drest? Did he smile or say
anything clever? In short, was there anything about him unlike him-
.# É. must know these things; it won’t wait for a committee,
as Sebastopol did. But if this man has been really filched from us,
and nothing is left of him but a blest shade, what must be the feelings
of the wretched press that killed him * 'What! to be assailed with
obloquy till his little heart broke, because he failed at Vienna! Why
was he sent there? Can a man be made a first-rate diplomatist at half
an hour's notice? it took more than half a century to make the great
LoRD WesTMORELAND what he is;–the fact is, this mission to Vienna
was a delusion and a snare, and success impossible. They say, that his
first landing in France was a perfect treat, although to an Englishman
rather a humiliating one. We have all seen the same thing happen a
hundred times, a grand Johnny, no matter whether a John NY
fussºil, or a Johnsº Rºw, a miſordo in short—arrives, and steps on
to the quay: he is twigged in a moment, his air, his look, his gait, his
suite, his importance, his ignorance of French, betray him in an instant.
Mock civility, half-suppressed smiles, boys with their tongues in their
cheeks nudging each other, saucy girls staring and laughing outright,
pursue him at every step. Everybody knows and feels that a great gºose
is just landed, to be plucked by the first comer, and it is difficult indeed
to recognise in him the clever Ambassador who is to outwit all the
practised diplomatists of the Continent, where the medium of communi-
cation is French... It is said of poor LoRD JoHN, that, being aware of
his deficiency in that language, he never ventured upon it but once
which was, I believe, in Paris, where, on leaving the room, he desire
} waiter not to let the fire go out, saying, ‘Garçon, ne laissez pas sortir
e fow.”
“Thence this ill-used man is packed off to Vienna, to be cast
headlong into a circle of professional mystifiers, astute schemers,
heroes, whiskered, and decorated, self-important and self-possessed,
conversant with all the arts of which he knows nothing, the manners
customs, plots, in a word, dodges and languages of that phase of
Continental life. . What boots it to oppose to them an accurate know-
ledge of Hansard, quotations of parliamentary precedents, an intimate
acquaintance with the SPEAKER or the SERJEANT-AT-ARMs. Of what
value is the cock of St., Stephens, in such an assembly as that ? Many
of us have seen, no doubt, in our lives, a strange little dog introduced
all of a sudden into a kennel of fox-hounds; it is a pitiable sight; the
F. little animal is naturally frightened to death, and does not know
how to humble itself, and to submit and to cringe enough; it twists
itself into shapes, bends and wriggles about, and hides away its little
tail; presently it rolls on its side, then on its back, holding up its poor
little paws, begging, pardon, and ready to die; they jºi. stalk
fiercely round with bristles erect and half-suppressed growls at their
small and abject foe.
“Such was our luckless Ambassador, at Vienna. Fancy him in the
council-chamber, attacked at once by all the grandees of many empires.
First, there advances against him the fierce Prussian Count ALLPUFF
voN BIERUNBACKIE, then comes up the portly Austrian BARon

ownwhiskERoff. -

KING CLICQUOT'S HORSE.
HERE shall be no
blame to Punch, if
º the KING of PRUs-
- SIA’s horse be not
duly chronicled, in
order that some
future historian of
our times may give
it its rightful place.
Bucephalus has a
º — and
why not KING
FREDERICK WIL-
LIAM's one-legged
charger? ... We say
one-legged, as it ap-
pears that the other
three are merely
auxiliary to the po-
tent one. The horse
that carries Prus-
sia's king is, in
fact, uno-ped. The
Times'Prussiancourt
chronicler thus speaks of the horse and his rider:—
“The King can only ride his own horse, trained and schooled to canter always with
the same leg, and to keep that pace, and that leg even when turning round corners, &c.
The animal is left to its own conception of what is becoming in Royal equestrian
etiquette, for the King sets in motion neither thigh nor heel nor whip to convey to it
any expression of his own wishes in this respect.”
Style is the man, says BUFFON. Sure we are that the natural philo-
sopher might have added—the horse is the man: for how admirably
does the KING's horse develop the KING's policy! . He can only go his
own way upon one leg, and with one leg turn round all political corners.
How different was WELLINGTON's horse Copenhagenſ For is it not
upon record, after Waterloo, when the fight was done, that that im-
mortal chesnut as his master descended from him, gave a whinny,
a caper, and a caricole, as much as to say—“get, up again once more,
if you like; I can go through as much again.” But where should
we have been if Copenhagen had had the merit of only one leg?
There can be no doubt that KING WILLIAM's horse, like the horses
of RINALDo and all the other knights of fable, has some deep intelli-
gence with his mystic master. Sufficiently animated by the mind of
the KING the animal acts wholly as befits his Majesty. PHILIP DE
CoMINEs relates how his horse, after a certain battle, plunged his head
into a pail-full of red wine, and drank it up. And we know, on the
credit of Robert, BRow NING, how the good horse Roland won and
enjoyed his draught:-
“And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,
As I pour'd down his throat our last measure of wine,
Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)
Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.”
The KING of PRUSSIA’s horse is similarly addicted to wine. When
turned out to grass, he is always caught, not in the ordinary way with
a sieve of oats, but with successive poppings of champagne corks. In
fact, although the horse has only one leg to canter, or rather decanter
upon, it is hitherto unknown what amount of champagne he can
carry, especially when KING FREDERICK WILLIAM is upon his back.
A Parliamentary Pudding.

THE Press irreverently calls, MR. HENRY DRUMMOND “the Jack-
Pudding of Parliament. MºDRUMMOND may still have some pudding
left in him, but what, oh, what, have become of all the plums?’ -

|A TOUCHING SCENE AT THE OLD BALLEY.
In the case of the fraudulent Bankers, PAUL, STRAHAN,
AND BATEs, we should be rejoiced to say that the Prosecutor
and the Judge had “done their duty like men,” if unfortu.
nately they had not laid themselves open to the charge of
having done their duty like women. BARon ALDERson
was “deeply affected” while passing sentence, and DR.
GRIFFITH, the prosecutor, “shed tears” on the occasion.
We really cannot see the necessity for all this sentimental
snivelling over one of the clearest matters of duty that any
persons could have to perform; and we say, without hesi-
tation, that there is a great deal more to cry about, more
matter for §§ and commiseration in nine cases out of
ten, at the Old Bailey, than in the case of these dishonest
Bankers.
We seldom or never hear of either prosecutors or judges
crying over the trial and sentencing of the friendless and
uneducated criminal, nor can we excuse the weakness that
weeps over the richly-merited punishment of three of the
most offensive culprits that ever added to the enormity of
crime by the basest hypocrisy. Delinquency is always a fit
subject for § but we scarcely remember a case in which
the guilty deserved less commiseration than did MEssRs.
STRAHAN, PAUL, AND BATEs, who were beset by none of
the temptations of want, and had none of the excuses
usually claimed for ignorance. The punishment of such
persons is a subject of general congratulation to all who
are interested in the purity and impartiality of justice; and
so far from there being any legitimate cause for the shed-
ding of tears on the Bench, we are satisfied that the Crier of
the Court might have been very properly left to do all the
crying that was suitable to the occasion.
Diplomatic.
THE EMPEROR SouLouquE has just instituted a new
Order, the Order of Uncle Tom. His negro ambassador,
black as the night, BARON DAMIER, has arrived at St.
James's, and the American Ambassador has not yet given
notice to quit. It is said that the EARL of WesTMoRELAND
º relieved from his duties at Vienna, will represent
England at the Court of Haiti. He may be hourly expected
in London en route; for his fiddle-case arrived yesterday.
CHASTISFMENT FOR CROWNED CRIMINALS.
HE EARL OF ELLESMERE,
in a lecture on the War,
delivered the other night
at Worsley, near Man-
chester, estimated the
total Russian loss, since
the commencement of hos-
tilities, at not less than
300,000 men at the least.
Suppose, we divide these
victims between the late
and the present MoLoch
between NICHOLAs an
ALEXANDER, this.com-
putation gives 150,000 vic-
tims a-piece to each of the
Molochs.
Now that symbol of
Russian dominion and
instrument of Russian rule,
the knout, is, as adminis-
tered by CzARs, an inven-
tion of the same kind and
quality as the wheel, the
- - stake, and the impaling
iron. Nothing so diabolical exists anywhere out of Russia in the
º world, except in the Southern States of civilised, America.
et for a murder, for one human life deliberately sacrificed to pride
and ambition, it would hardly be too severe a sentence to award
one cut of the knout. Three or four strokes delivered by a practised
hand—by that of an accomplished Muscovite artist—are sufficient
to supersede the final operation of Jack. KETCH...Even of such
stripes one would scarcely be one too many for the wilful, determined,
cruel author of a single murder. Few people will consider that one
stripe of * sort per murder would be an excessive measure of
punishment.

After a torture of as many as three hundred lashes, inflicted at the
ordinary rate, recovery sometimes happens. One of these lashes would
robably be borne with some fortitude by an average rascal, and even
É. preferred by him to a common whipping. Now, suppose there were
European sessions or assizes, with European judges to preside at them,
and É. juries to sit, and try, convict, and sentence European
criminals; suppose Nicholas to have been arraigned before such a
tribunal, and to have been condemned to one knout-stroke of customary
smartness on account of each of the 150,000 murders for which he
ought to have suffered. The death of the culprit under the knout does
not arrest the hand of the executioner; the sentence is carried out on
the corpse. Into how many shreds would the anointed body of
Nicholas have been flogged?
Had such an example been made of NICHOLAs, would the successor
to his seven-league-boots of ambition have dared to walk in them,
and be, at this moment, meritorious of the whipping which, if every.
body had their deserts, his father, at any rate, would certainly not
have escaped? -- -
Of course, we are aware what stuff and nonsense it is to say that
aggressive war for territorial aggrandisement is equivalent to murder,
with a view to robbery; because we know that there is all the
difference between them that exists between a wholesale and a retail
transaction. Moreover, the former is sanctified by religious invoca-
tions, and attended with a tremendous deal of pomp and circumstance;
whilst the latter is committed either with oaths and curses, or in
silence and in the dark. Still, there will be no end of war, and con:
sequent taxation, in this world, till it becomes fashionable to hoot and
hiss national aggressors, however extensive, as assassins and thieves;
to raise a hue and cry after them living; and to name them with
execration when dead. What is the use, Jones, of such execration,
hooting, and hissing, considered as the solo of you, Jones?, Hiss,
hoot, and execrate away, friend Jones, with all your might, heedless
of wet blankets—your solo in good time will become a chorus.

It is unnecessary to add, that the House rose at RACHEL before the
end of the song.
A DRAMATIC WORD FOR MES. BROWNRIGG.
WHAT are our dramatists about? We have magnificent revivals, but
wherefore have we not fine originals? We know that stage genius will
create a soul under the ribs of a state chair, and breathe a grand spirit
of inspiration throughout the universality of upholstery: we know that
so many gilt nails studding a footstool will flash with more than the
brilliancy of mere poetic metaphor: we know further that there is a
learned and withal a very reverent, appreciation of these things that
cannot, and indeed ought not to be otherwise, than sustaining and
sweetly rewardful of the enterprising mind that exhausts all old forms
of furniture, and then imagines new. These things are called solem-
nities. The drama may be dead; but then, is not its very funeral a
solemnity? The tragic mute who stands at the door of defunct Mel-
PomeNE,--is not that mute a solemnity? Unquestionably. However,
to leave this part of the question, the velvet and rosewood auxiliaries
of the Fº drama, let us give a minute to the consideration of the
º drama, as its elements lie around us. - -
ewgate is shamefully neglected. That is a quarry that remains, in-
exhaustible. The statue of MEMNON became vocal to the kindling
touch of APOLLo; there is not a stone of Newgate that, under the in-
spiring exhortation of the poetic lyre, would not give utterance to a
powerful drama; a drama as neatly, as strongly, and withal as cohe-
rently constructed as JACK SHEPPARD's chains, to be still shown to the
curious in Newgate lobby.
It has long been our fixed opinion, that MRs. BrownRIGG has been a
very ill-used and most neglected gentlewoman. Why should she not
make at once the brain and the heart of a four-act drama? Wery
beautiful effects of chiar’oscuro might be produced in the coal-hole;
whilst MRS. B. might whip the apprentices out of life to a death-chaunt
SELLE RACHEL consented to sing the Marseillaise at the Metropolitan
Theatre. Her delivery of the spirit-stirring composition elicited, on
every occasion the tumultuous applause of an overflowing audience.
But, we understand, this was º to the frantic enthusiasm ;
which she lashed her republican admirers by º -
another version of it—the hymn of Liberty rendered into the negro
dialect—in character. With her face and arms blacked, she unex-
pectedly rushed upon the stage, *::::: the tricolor, and shrieked
out, amid a storm of impassioned thunder, the following verses:-
sing
Jim 'long black chillern"ob de nation,
De day ob glory we behold,
De agin our’mancipation
De stars and stripes um hab unroll’d.
Hark don’t you hear de sogers drummin’?
Dem wicked debbles, how dey swear!
Our babies from our breasts to tear,
Desabage bloodhounds is a comin'.
To arms, my niggar men
Formee de battle band: -
March on, march on, wid deir vile gore,
Dat you may drench de land 1
What want dem fellahs, dem dare oders,
Agin dese niggars leagued in vain?
To rivet upon men and broders
De handcuffs and de slabe's ole chain?
Niggars, ah, how dis would disgrace us!
Our fury how him ought to flare,
'Tis us to threaten dat dey dare, -
In our ole slabery to replace us! |
To arms, &c.
O sacred lub obblessed freedom,...,
e niggars arm sustain and guidel
O Liberty, direct um, lead um,
Fight by thy champion niggar's side
Range us beneath dis victorious,
To #. and conquer on de field,
Until de Tyrant forced to yield,
down de niggar triumph glorious.
To arms, &c.
that would alike vindicate the versatility of the strong-minded actress,
and vary the deep emotional effect upon the spell-bound hearers.
There is great moral teaching latent in the . Of '. BROWNRIGG:
whilst all her domestic history is full of a grand, grim power of intellect
that is especially available to the strong-minded actress; to that .
instant, vehement energy that tells like a crowbar on the under:
standing of a most thinking audience. With, we hope, a full sense of
the peculiar merits, the pathetic household interest, of The Beginning
and the End, inflicted at the Haymarket,_we nevertheless, incline to
believe that the story of MRs. BRowNRIgG contains still stronger
elements of the dramatic in all combinations of forgery, suicide, and
murder. We understood from a distinguished translator that MR. CAL-
CRAFT, of the Old Bailey, was in the gallery, and marked his strong
sense of the moral fitness of the drama with the most powerful lan-
e. He airily observed that The Beginning and the End was very
ike a halter, bearing nothing but a dead weight.
In conclusion, we must again recommend MRs. BROWNRIgG to the
dramatic genius of the country. The homeliness of the subject in no
way precludes the adjunct of the picturesque. What, for instance–
supported and buttressed by antiquarian authorities—could be finer
than A Moving Panorama from the Old Bailey to Tyburn, with a Vision
of Mercy to the inexorable George the Third at St. James's Palace?
In addition to this, MRs. BrownRIGG's victim, apprentices, in white
satin, might ascend on a milk-white cloud raised from this world to the
next by invisible wires. In conclusion, we hopefully ask, will the
honoured, the venerable bard of Nitocris try his master hand upon
the neglected MRs. BRowNRIGGP If not he, will the original English
writer of the German Ingomar essay the task?. After The Beginning
and the End, we are surely taught to be satisfied with something very
middling. The Beginning and the End, it seems, is taken bodily from
HoRACE SMITH's tan-pit novel Jane Lomar / It was announced, of
course, as “original:” but this no doubt was done on philosophic
principles. “The mixture of a lie doth ever please,” says BAcON.
Hyde Park Parliament.
WE hear that the Government is about to take decisive and strong
measures to stop the Sabbath gatherings in Hyde Park. If they are
attempted to be continued, the Government—it is said-haye come to
the determination to throw open on Sundays the British Museum, the
National Gallery, and the Crystal Palace. This resolution is the best
evidence of a really strong Cabinet.

however, budged no further from the coast of Brittany than Guernsey;

We respect VICTOR Hugo for his genius and for the sincerity of his
opinions; but he has fallen into questionable company, and rouge is apt
to come off. We hear that several of his English admirers have
resolved to present him with a testimonial in token of their sympathy.
The gift is to be a statue of Liberty, Nothing could be more appro-
priate than a statue under the circumstances; for a statue teaches what
may be the wisest of all human lessons,—namely, silence.

SIR PETER LAURIEPS MISSION.
NEXT, to a “man with a grievance,” a “man with a mission” is
one of the most serious nuisances that afflict society. A man with a
grievance has the best possible intentions jºinţii and a man
with a mission may have the best intentions towards his fellow.
creatures, but the latter individual may become almost as great a bore
as the former. The mission of SIR %. LAURIE is to put down
...; to tear the mask from the face of commercial false#.
and to administer such rubs as will effectually rub the gilt off all com:
mercial gingerbread. The vocation is not an unworthy one, but it
sometimes leads to irregularities and absurdities, when the judicial
Bench is converted into a place for making all sorts of inquiries, which
as far as the administration of justice is concerned, may be classed
under the head of impertinent curiosity.
An instance of this sort of thing occurred the other day at Guildhall,
where SIR PETER having a person before him charged with forgery,
expresses, an opinion that the accused “is a respectable man,” but
remands him because, in SIR PETER's own words, “I should like to
know something about you and Colvill.” Now Colvill, is the pro-
secutor, and why a respectable person should be remanded in order to
gratify the Magistrate's curiosity as to the person who makes a charge,
is somewhat mysterious. The only light thrown upon the matter is to be
found in the exclamation of SIR PETER: “I will remand you till Saturday,
and will then attend here myself, for I should like to pursue this inquiry.”
SIR PETER has evidently an inquiring mind, but it would be better
to keep his general researches into private character distinct from his
investigation of a P. charge, unless the former have any real bearing
on the latter. If one man accuses another, it is rather irregular to
remand the latter for the purpose of learning “something about” the
former, unless that “something” has reference to the matter imme-
diately under investigation... The fact, however, is that SIR PETER
feeling it to be his "mission” to expose fraud, is not very particular as
to the regularity of the means of doing so. he is apt to forget that he
is placed on the Bench to perform the duties of a magistrate, and not
to act the part of a detective. In the case to which we are referring,
he exclaimed, “It is astonishing the credulity of tradesmen. I have
been sitting here for thirty years, and I can’t put them on their guard.”
This remark proves beyond doubt the impression of SIR PETER LAURIE,
that the City Justice Room is intended as much for the exposure of
fraud as for the punishment of criminals. Some people may be of the
same opinion as the worthy Alderman on the subject, but for our own
arts we think that any irregularity in the administration of Justice is
É. poorly requited by any amount of exposure that may be accom-
plished under the pretext of conducting a judicial inquiry. For ex-
posures of the kind, the press is a far more legitimate and more effective
remedy than the Police Court.
EARLY CLOSING.--THE LADIES” LEAGUE.
WE learn that Committees of Ladies are about to be formed to carry
out the principle of Early Closing; the ladies º; themselves,
and if necessary, all that is dear to them, to abstain from all evening
shopping. We are delighted to hear this, as we are convinced that
the news will be most welcome to thousands of affectionate husbands
driven out to their clubs by the evening absence of the best and
brightest ornament of the fireside—the wife. With evening shopping
rigorously suppressed, the fond husband will be enabled to take the
partner of his bosom to the opera, the theatre, the concert; places
which, if he visits at all, he is now too frequentl compelled to visit
alone. The movement on the part of the ladies, if successful, will be
a great boon to husbands. It is, besides, a promising beginning.
Who knows? In time, if properly 'provoked, women may give up
shopping altogether.
STARTLING ANNOUNCEMENT.
A PARAGRAPH in a recent number of our fashionable contemporary
has the following remarkable heading:-
“SALE of Royal, BEASTs IN WINDson GREAT PARK.”
There being no Royal Beasts in existence except Lions, and KING
BoMBA, and perhaps another monarch, who is said occasionally to make
a beast of himself, the above announcement is calculated to excite
terror and alarm in the minds of HER MAJESTY's subjects. It suggests
the idea that there are live lions roaming about. indsor Park: a
frightful thing for Cockney excursionists, and, indeed, anybody also
roaming there, to think of. However, it might also convey the notion
§."#. THE EIGHTH, and certain other of his predecessors and
successors had been exhumed and disposed of—say, to the College of
Surgeons; which would have constituted a sale of Royal, Beasts, at
least of their carcases; but all apprehension will be allayed when the
fact is, known, that the Royal Beasts alluded to, were only seventy-
three “superior hormed Scotch oxen.”

THE WANTS OF A GENTLEMAN.
THE author of the following advertisement has his wants, or rather,
his deficiencies, though he seems to be sadly mistaken as to what he is
really in need of; for instead of advertising for a Wife, he had much
better apply for a Governess. His domestic condition may be bad
. but his grammar. is still worse; and he must be enjoying a
double felicity, for in addition to his single blessedness, he must expe-
rience the bliss that is said to be united with ignorance.
ATRIMONY.—A GENTLEMAN by birth, in appearance, manners,
and address, age 86, but of most lonely condition, not having scarcely a friend,
with a view to marry, he would be happy, in secresy and honour, to treat with any
amiable single or widow lady, of independent position, not more than forty-five, fond
of travelling; her means, with a part of mine, can be settled on herself. Any letter
will be attended to in a few days, should I be favoured with any. Address, Baaville,
Post Office, opposite Kingsland Gate, London.
We can scarcely wonder at the lonely condition of this “gentleman
by birth, in appearance, manners, and address,” for if he looks like a
gentleman, he will naturally repel the advances of the ignorant; while
on the other hand, the detection of his ignorance will exclude him from
the Society of gentlemen. The lady he requires must indeed be “very
fond of travelling,” if she can sympathise with an individual who travels
from the third person to the first with the recklessness and rapidity
shown by this “most lonely” man, who, whatever may be his ante.
cedents, inflicts the mºst barbarous treatment on his relatives. Possibly
he contemplates suicide, for we cannot otherwise explain the passage
“any letter will be attended to in a few days, should I be favoured
with any.” If this does not mean that he will answer a letter in a few
days, should any days remain to him, it means nothing. We recommend
the wretched BARVILLE, of Kingsland Gate, to join an evening school ||
for adults on the very earliest opportunity.
DESTRUCTION OF WORKS OF ART.
A PARAGRAPH with the above title has been going the round of the
papers, for the purpose of puffing the property of a parcel of tradesmen
who are anxious to get a good price for a quantity of old prints, on the
strength of their being the last of the stock, just as the orange-women
in the streets tempt a purchaser by the offer of “the last penn'orth in
the basket.” The whole affair is a piece of Wandalism, without any
excuse in these days; for though we are certainly a nation of shop-
keepers, there are few of us who would think that the destruction of
any Work of Art or genius is to be excused for the sake of adding to
the gains of a few shopkeepers. Perhaps, however, there is no real
sacrifice in the matter after all, for the plates, about the destruction of
which so much fuss has been made, are understood to have been pretty
well worn out, and consequently, of no further use to the Proprietors.
This is a far more sensible view to take of the matter than to pretend
that the articles were still of any material worth, and indeed who would
believe that the parties concerned would have made any sacrifice at all,
if another penny was to be turned in a commercial enterprise? The
principle on which, it was pretended that the Engravings have been
destroyed is too ridiculous to be entertained for a º moment, and
indeed, it would be equally absurd to knock LoRD MAYOR Moon on
the head at the close of his Cockney-regal career, to prevent the possi-
bility of there being another like him.
Shakspearian Lectures.
MR. Gough, who has been shamefully mulcted of his quota of income
tax, is about to give a lecture at Exeter Hall to re-imburse himself: the
ecture will be on the following passage from SHAKSPEARE-"Now

THE RHAPSODIES OF THE ROSTRUM.
HERE has been a struggle among
a few advertising auctioneers for
the mantle of the late GEORGE
RoBINs, which not having fallen
on any º air of shoulders,
seems likely to be torn to tatters
in the tugging and pulling that it
as experienced from the rather
inferior hands that have had a
snatch at it. Once we thought
a certain MR. ALFRED Cox had
got the garment about him in an
awkward way, but he had not
strutted about very far, when we
find it torn from him and employed
Mond...This latter º has
evidently found neither a grammar
nor a spelling-book in the pockets
of the mantle, or, if he has, he
declines to make use of them ;
and, indeed, he has got the article
so strangely twisted about him,
that it trips him up every now and then, as will be seen from the
following advertisement:-
TIME HOUSE, MONMOUTH, beautifully situated on an eminence
declivitating precipitateously to the banks of the river Monnow, picturesquely
studded with foliaged underwood; lies adjacent to the town about two miles, and is
approached from the rustic village ef Rockfield by a private bridge across the stream-
let scene, entering by a lodge of characteristic design, along a park-like drive to the
substantially erected donnain, built with every carefulness to preserve the neatness of
its more imposing architectural style, altogether surrounded by those more delightful
instances of our richer tastes, with a varied and undulating landscape, embracing a
mountainous and valley view, of a truly rural cast. To those lovers of nature and of
sport in its many forms, here is offered to them the full indulgence of their pleasurable
of so vast a fund of cheerful recourse. A right would be granted to shoot over 1200
acres of farm lands adjoining, with liberty to the preserves of the abundantly stocked
rivulets and streams. In the season, a 3. of most favoured fox hounds meet regu-
larly in the adjoining covers. The residence, in every way, is in neat and decorative
repair, is in readiness for the immediate reception of a family of distinction, together
with about 27 acres of parklike grounds, consisting of meadow and orchard land, well
stocked with valuable fruits, with an *::::: productive kitchen garden, and an
ornamental and tastefully laid out lawn. Coach house, and stabling for six horses and
farm buildings. To be let for a term of years. Rent £140.
To the inquiring mind the above picturesque piece of writing will
º: a variety of questions, to which no one less audacious than
Echo would attempt to give an answer. We will, however, set forth
the queries, for the amusement of those who, in the approaching season
of Nuts to Crack and other popular puzzles, may wish to exercise their
ingenuity. In the first place; Is it the “rustic village,” or the “private
bridge,” or the “streamlet scene” that “enters by a lodge of charac.
teristic design?” and, secondly, though it is often said that one street
runs out of another, How is the mystery of a “rustic village,” or a pri-
wate º ” or a “streamlet scene,” “entering by a lodge,” to be
accounte for? -
Passing over the more poetical portion of the announcement, we
would inquire, as a matter of business, and in the most prosaic manner,
What can be the use of the right of sport in its many forms,” if there
is to be “liberty to the preserves of the abundantly stocked rivulets and
streams?” for, if the fish are to have their liberty secured, the labours
of the sportsman would be superfluous. We dont quite understand the
allusion to “a pack of the most favoured foxhounds;” and cannot
say whether they are lightly worked, or are well “favoured” in the
ordinary sense, and are a good-looking pack of animals. The capacity
of the residence must, indeed, be enormous; for we are told it is ready
“for the immediate reception of a family of distinction, together with
about twenty-seven acres of park-like grounds.” So that, while the
; allows an entrance through it for a “rustic village,” a “private
bridge,” or a “streamlet, scene,” no less than twenty-seven acres of
land can be accommodated inside the residence. The coach-house and
stabling are equally capacious, being adapted “for six horses and farm-
buildings;” an arrangement which must have its inconveniences, as
well as its advantages. The proprietor of Tump House may, accordin
to the above advertisement, be prepared to find a “private bridge,
or even a “rustic village,” in his lodge; “an extremely productive
kitchen-garden "in his dining-room; and, finally, a barn, or granary,
or any other species of “farm building” in his coach-house .# stable.
It is clear that there will be a good deal to doin the way of turning the
house, or rather the grounds, out of window, before comfortable
possession can be taken of the premises.
THE PRINCIPLE or THE NEW CoALITION,+Three Heads are better
than one.
as a wrapper by one MR. HAM-
desires in an available manner, delightfully changed by the well-selected assortment
-— — —
MUSCOWITE WIT.
THE Russian Papers are filled with the most ridiculous stories
against the English. As some of these are weak and clumsy and not
so violently absurd as they might be, we make the Muscovite journals
a present of the following extravagant fictions, which, of course, they
will solemnly present to their readers as positive facts:
Ean Egious ExTRAvAgArce IN ENGLAND.—The inhabitants of London not only
wear hats to protect their heads, but umbrellas also to protect their hats. The wonder
is, they do not wear something over the umbrella to protect the umbrella also? How.
ever, the crowning folly is, that the umbrella, which gets all the rain, frequently cost:
twice the value of the hat that it protects from it!
The DEPTH of AN ENGLISHMAN's Folly.—A Cossack had fallen into one of the
wells that abound in the neighbourhood of Sadlers' Wells. “Oh, help me! help me!'
he cried piteºusly, “I will give two roubles to any one who helps me out of this
dilemma,” “But how is it to be done?” inquired a fat idiot of an Englishman from
the top. “Why, put yourself in the bucket that is up there, and when you are down
|here we will talk about it.” The Englishman did as he was bid, and his superior
| weight in descending had the effect of pulling up the Cossack, who was in the opposite
bucket. “Thank you, my good friend, a thousand times,” he exclaimed, when he had
safely reached the surface, "wait there, please, until I come back, and pay you the two
roubles," and he went away grinning hugely in his sleeve.
How AN ENGL1shMAN was DoNE BY A Cossack.-An Englishman and a Cossack
agreed to pull for a tallow-candle. It was to be held between their teeth, and the
were to pull and pull until one side was the conqueror. The candle was firmly fix
when the Cossack said, “Are you ready?" The stupid Englishman exclaimed
“Ye-e-e-es;” but no sooner was his mouth opened than the crafty Cossack pulled away
the candle, so that he had the whole of the luscious morsel to himself.
THE SUMMIT or BRITIs H. Folly.—Will it be believed that the English º long
spikes of iron, longer than any Cossack's lance, on their º: and the tops of their
public edifices—and the object of this absurd precaution, it is said, is to prevent any
one falling upon the buildings and damaging them?
BRITIsh. AbsURDITY.-The English: noblemen put furs and bearskins round the
hammercloths of their carriages. Now, as the coachman sits outside and not inside the
hammercloth, this cannot be to protect him from the cold—and we should like to know
what can be the benefit of keeping the hammercloth warm? They might as well put
muffs on the ..º. or wrap boas round the spokes of the wheels? But it is
just like those stupid English!
INCREDIBLE IGNoHANCE IN THE BRITISH NAvy 1–One of the Lords of the Admiralty
(and they are men generally selected for their superior wisdom), finding that his
| weathercock annoyed him terribly with its creaking noise during the night, gave
directions that it should be mailed fast so that it could not move, but that a man should
come every Monday and set it right for the ensuing weekl
THE Roy AL INTELLECT or THE UNITED KINGDowl—We have all heard of the
PRINCE of WALEs, who cried, ready to break his heart, because on breaking open his
drum he could not find the noise he expected to find inside, but this is as nothing com-
pared to the PRIxca or PAddingtoN (the QUEEN's second son), who bought a magpie
purposely to test the experiment, whether such birds were in the habit of living seven
hundred years 1 . Such is the state of education of the barbarian country that dares to
go to war with civilised Russia!
THE NEWGATE BANKERS.
SIR John DEAN PAUL, whilst he *. had his religion in his
mouth, rarely failed to have his hands in other men's pockets. , Whilst
at liberty, Sir John's religion was, of course, a counterfeit and a flam.

tween which there is comparatively little, chemical affinity; and if
taken into the mouth disorganization of the teeth must inevitabl

they are composed than it, has for the alumina, or than has the phos-

Confectioners at large for the service which they render us in allowing
their plum-buns, to contain so frequently little pebbles and bits of
stone. These things are connected with the plums or currants, and
sugar, and could only be removed from them by a careful process of
F.; and picking, which, happily for us, is not always, resorted to.
The pebble-stones have no chemical action on the teeth, like the alum;
but they exert a mechanical one, which we find nearly as advantageous.
They crack, the teeth, which are not strong, enough to crack them.
Chipped and starred thus, the grinders soon decay, ache, have to be
drawn, and replaced with our terro-metallies. We derive a deal
of business from these stones contained in plum-cakes; but not half so

It then goes on to intimate that there is “to be let, for a
term of 99 years, without restriction } the Freeholder as
to offensive Trades, an isolated Freehold Estate of 180
acres.”
We presume the landlord intends to be non-resident on
this Estate, which he seems desirous of converting into a
region of pestilential vapours. We wish the place, were
large enough to accommodate all the obnoxious trades in
England; but if the advertiser succeeds in carrying away
one half of them to his own domain, he will have deserved
well of his country.

THE intense respect one feels for the speculations of the
American journalists on the subject of European politics can-
not be increased, but still, if they would take the smallest
pains to inform themselves of the facts of the cases they die-
cuss, it would not injure theyalue of their lucubrations. Qne

A PRESENT TO THE KING OF PRUSSIA.
PRussia is not generally supposed to be the Land of Freedom;
nevertheless its inhabitants do, appear to take strange liberties with
their .# The other day, as our readers are aware, when
FREDERICK-WILLIAM visited Cologne and Aix-la-Chapelle, the people
exhibited#. of his Majesty, representing him crowned with vine-
leaves / Fancy, during a Royal Progress to Qsborne or Balmoral, the
railway-stations decorated with pictures of PRINCE ALBERT in the
ALBERT hat! ... Well; but still more recently the officers of the Prussian
army—men of breeding we should have º had the
impudence to present the King with a Sword; and what is more, the
Crown Prince himself accepted the office of delivering that emblem of
courage and honour to his brother. Such a practical sarcasm was
perhaps never before perpetrated on any man, not to say monarch.
The only joke of the sort that we ever heard of, approaching it in
severity, is that of sending a cake of soap to a slut. It was wise to get
the Crown Prince to deliver the satirical testimonial. The offer of the
hilt was a moral stab, and an apprehension might well have been enter-
tained, that the outraged Sovereign would instantly have repaid
the cut at his dignity with a thrust in the stomach, and have plunged
the weapon into the viscera of any person less nearly related to
. Yet, surely, the Prince, in doing such a thing, could not have
known what he was about; though of the two Royal Brothers we
have never understood that this one, at least, is occasionally subject to
that sort of ignorance. FREDERICK-WILLIAM himself appears to have
had no suspicion of the irony conveyed in the F. of steel. He saw,
it seems, the point of the one no better, than he could have seen that
of the other, and his mental vision may be concluded to have been, on
that occasion, as hazy as his bodily eyesight is always. For he is said,
indeed, to be as blind, physically, as he is to those considerations to
which the chivalry of his kingdom has attempted to give him a hint of
his insensibility in a sword. Whether or not the sword was a broad-
sword, we cannot say, but we are sure that it was infinitely less broad
than the hint. The latter was, of course, thrown away, and’so we
should think was the former too; not at the time of presentation, nor
from then till that of bed, but, certainly, as early the next morning, as
his *:::: awoke, and was informed of the gift which he had accepted
the day before.
The ATRICAL.
It is rumoured that young FITzsPURs, late of the 2ndLife Guards, is
about to º: at the Haymarket as Jºliº. All we shall then want to
complete the cast will be one of the last Field-Marshals as the Nurse.
THE CLERICAL ADWERTISER.
..HERE is an advertisement which we copy from John Bull, but if we
did not know from what T. it came, and that it was a bond fide
announcement, we should have taken it for a squib let off by some
heterodox periodical. Its authors, however, offer, in all gravity:
“To the Clergy and Profession . . . . . Unique study chairs, particularly
adapted to the Clergy, &c.; from the ease and relaxation afforded, the fatigue of long
3.ºftenurely obviated, and the change of position without exertion instantly
Certainly, if we did not know better, we should have regarded,the
above as intended to insinuate against the Clergy an extraordinary love
of ease, so intense as to demand a chair that would be easier, than any
already existing easy chair. It represents that reverend º aS §.
ticularly subject to a fatigue which is simply that of sitting still, and at
the same time it proposes to save them the trouble of making any
exertion in *:::: their sedentary positions. If this is not to impute
the height of laziness to the clerical profession, we cannot imagine
what that altitude can be.
Of course, instead of reclining in study chairs and amusing themselyes
—as lolling about in that way would imply—with the perusal of light lite-
rature, accompanied probably with cigars, the Clergy are habitually on
their legs, visiting the sick and the poor, and hunting up the vicious; so
that the advertiser who would wish to get anything out of them by
catering to their personal comforts, should offer them, not commo-
dities like easy-chairs, but such articles as stout boots, Indian rubber
goloshes, and waterproof over-gowns.
Natural Indignation.
WE perceive that the beasts at the Surrey Zoological Gardens have
been offered for Sale by Auction. It seems that some of the husbands
of the females who exhibited their infants at the Baby Show there,
were naturally anxious to get rid of such partners, and wished them
included in the catalogue (the formal sale to be conducted in the old
halter fashion), but the four-footed brutes, .# those which had
taken the honours of maternity, howled so indignantly against such an
association, that the unfortunate husbands’ petition was rejected.
“where IGNORANCE Is BLIss—”

Ain't I happy? Here’s the Dentist coming to-morrow, and Pa has
promised me sixpence for every tooth that I have pulled out!”

ARMY FASHIONS FOR NOWEMBER.
WINGs hitherto have only pertained to the army collec-
tively, drawn up in battle array; but the individual soldier,
if we are rightly informed, will, in the case of a particular
regiment, very soon be, if he is not already, in possession of
at least something very like those appendages.
We believe it has been determined, by an illustrious
Field-Marshal to make a change in the uniform of HER
MAJESTY's Life Guards; which will impart to those gallant
fellows an appearance closely resembling that of Cochin-
China fowls.
This result will be obtained by the investment of the
military man in a very short tunic, which will stick out
laterally in a most ridiculous manner at the hips; and, in
combination with the thickness of look about, the legs
occasioned by the jack-boots, especially as the lower ex-
tremities of this corps are also very long, will suggest a
strong resemblance to that species of poultry.
The aiguillettes, also, we are told, are to be removed, by
the command of the illustrious Field-Marshal, from all the
uniforms, in order to distinguish them from his own, which
will retain those ornaments. There is some show of reason
for this arrangement, if it has been made; for the
a guillettes form the only military, distinction that the
illustrious Field-Marshal has acquired.
The Field-Marshal has further, we believe, ordained that
the officers shall wear their pouches when in full uniform
on all occasions, including the nobility and gentry's balls,
for which the pouches are not generally considered suitablr.
The principal reason for this change is said to be that the
Field-Marshal has so willed it.
The Field-Marshal has not changed the Life-Guardsman's
uniform to * tawny. If he has made the other changen,
he had better add this to them, and complete the resem-
blance of these fighting cocks to the fowls of Cochin China.
Walls have not always Ears.
WE maliciously enjoyed the dilemma of an organ-player
the other day. An obvious stranger to the English º
the Italian monster was grinding away opposite a D
Asylum, and went on pouring out tune after tune, evidently
wondering to himself that he made no impression upon the
establishment. Occasionally he would whistle to enhance
the discord, but not a window of the obdurate house was
ºpened, not a servant appeared at the door to pay him for
“moving on.” When we left, he had been there full ten
minutes, and he may be there now for what we know.
THE PASS OF THE PRINT-SHOPS.
WHATEVER progress the War may be making now abroad, it is dail
more and more º ..". here at home. The blockades whic
we have maintained in the Black Sea and the Baltic have, we fancy
been productive to the enemy of but trifling inconvenience, compared
to that which we are suffering from those in London. Every print-
shop that one passes—or rather that one doesn't—of course has its
window full of “Battle-scenes” and “Illustrations of the War,” and
the crowds who stand to look at them are becoming, to less curious and
leisurely pedestrians, what may be correctly called a standing nuisance.
By careful notes and calculations we have ascertained that, on an
average, we are now precisely sixteen minutes and three-quarters longer
walking to our office than we used to be formerly, before the War began:
and this serious delay would doubtless be much greater, if we were at
all less reckless of our dignity and coat-tails in the crowds we have to
crush through. -
We must be distinctly understood, however, that in noticing this
nuisance, we have not the slightest wish that the police should inter-
fere, nor the remotest motion of suggesting that the shops in question
should, for the time being, be asked to keep their shutters up. . We
would ever be among the last to deprive the British public of the least
of its privileges; .# although we may suspect that very many of these
“authentic sketches from the seat of War” were executed in reality on
a camp-stool, down at Margate, we have no desire to stop their being
publicly exhibited, without any charge except the rush to get a look at
them. At the same time, however, as a matter somewhat of importance
to the nation, we think it right to state that, while the crowds continue
we shall consider it a duty to our family to have our ribs insured, and
shall conceive ourselves injured if we are, left to pay the premiums. As
it is at present, the Pass of the Print-shops is to us a daily struggle
fully equalling in danger the Pass of Thermopylae.
THE LAMBTON BABIES AGAIN.
MR, PUNCH is ha # to learn that he has done some good by calling
attention to the #; ul peril to which the country was exposed, by its
being left possible that an EARL of DURHAM who did not inherit by
aristocratic succession, might some day legislate for the country. An
officially authorised person writes to say, that the blue ribbon which
the elder twin used to wear, in proof of his primogeniture, has been
rejected; and that the babies are now distinguished, the one by “a
bracelet with a ruby,” the other by a similar ornament “with a
topaz.” This is better, supposing, first, that the mischief has not
been already done; secondly, that the family can remember which jewel
belongs to which baby; and, thirdly, that the bracelets, are annealed
round the children's wrists (like the collar round the neck of Gurth in
Ivanhoe); so that when the infants are washed, the ornament cannot
be removed. These things understood, the Constitution and the House
of Lords are rather safer; but Mr. Punch confesses that, with his
devotion to the aristocracy, and his abiding and abounding faith in the
mystic influence of primogeniture, he should have preferred the tatoo
suggested by iº However, he has now done his duty, and will
merely wish the rightful heir and his brother happy minorities, and
joyous coming of ages in 1876, when Mr. Punch proposes to offer some
further remarks upon the subject, which may by that time be capable
of being treated in a varied point of view.
Ingenious Suggestion.
THE alleged difficulty of finding a brace of noblemen who would con-
descend to be Post-Master-General, and Colonial Secretary, might have
been lightened by fusing the two officers into one, and then the Colonies
might have a change of what they say seldom or never happens to them
now, namely, the delivery of their letters and newspapers.

prove to the inhabitants of the landward portion of Old Luce parish, a
useful auxiliary to his present complete arrangements in the posting

We should have thought that a Hearse would be literally
about the last thing that the inhabitants of any place could
have required, and we can only lament, that 6. Luce is
in such a dismal state, that the funeral arrangements for
the interment of the º ulation have become a
subject of such interest as to call for a congratulatory article

It is the EMPEROR's wish that they should be distributed amongst the

will be a joy to his paternal breast to learn that they are thus worn by
Messrs. BRIGHT, GLADSTONE, CoBDEN, and others of his beloved
children, to whom he owes more than he can ever pay.

be taken out-for it is the fatherly wish of ALEXANDER to show as much

mixture of both. -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[November 17, 1855.
How THE “MAN IN BRAss” RECEIVED THE INTELLIGENCE THAT IIIs
SERVICEs would BE DISPENSED witH AT THE LoRD MAYor's SHow,
Nov. 9TH, 1855.
ONE CURE FOR DRUNKENNESS.
LoRD ALBEMARLE says, truly no doubt, that the great obstacle to
the social improvement of the labouring classes is constituted by their
habits of drinking. Of course a Maine Liquor Law, stringently
enforced, would oblige them to discontinue these habits, by denying
their passion for drink the means of its gratification, and then that
passion would in all probability act after the manner of steam generated
at high pressure without any safety valve, or indeed * valve what-
ever. There would be a blow-up of some kind, or the vapour of
human nature would ooze out by the vent of perhaps a worse channel
of depravity. There were teetotallers before MR. Gough ; not only
FATHER MATTHEw and his disciples, but MAHOMET and the Turks.
So, then, it is desirable to invent some other plan of abolishing drunk-
enness than that of repressing the º to it from without.
Drunkenness is not a moral disease, but the symptom of one, called, in
plain English, unhappiness. The proper treatment consists in curing
that, which is impossible, but it can be sufficiently, palliated for the
purpose in most cases. People get drunk because they are not jolly;
if they were jolly they would not get drunk: the object is to make
them jolly without drinking.
Many methods of doing this have been suggested, but really the most
º one lies on the surface: it is that of making them jolly by
eating.
The great majority of those who drink too much belong to the class
of those who have not enough to eat. There are several reasons why
their food is insufficient, want of money among others; but one, if not
the least serious cause of that deficiency is, that what they have is
not made the most of
If philanthropists would patronise well-conducted eating-houses for
labouring persons throughout, the country; cook-shops at which they
could obtain the best meals that could be got out of the materials at
their command, there can be little doubt that the victuals would
powerfully attract them from the drink.
It has been proposed by the Colonel of a regiment in the Third
Division in the Crimea, to try the internal remedy of plum-pudding,
with a view to counteract the intoxication so unhappily prevalent
among our heroes there; and we have no doubt the prescription will
be much more effectual than the mere external application of the cat.
A Voice from a Clock.
THE Clock at Somerset House has appealed to the public, through
the columns of the Times, against the injustice of being made to say one
thing with its tongue, and another with its hands; or, in other words,
to strike three, while it shows the hour to be twelve on the face of it.
It was a good idea of man “to give atongue to time;” but, if the tongue
is false, it is idle to assume the aspect of truth in the face; or, in
: al r º, to exhibit such cheek as to negative any accusation

CANT IN THE COAL TRADE.
CHELTENHAM has long been remarkable for the spirit of Cant by
which its atmosphere is pervaded, and indeed, it is almost equally
notorious for its sanctity and its salts, its pump-room, and its piety:
The assumption of Religion is indeed amatter of business with many of
the inhabitants of Cheltenham, which is consequently converted into a
hot-bed, or we might venture to say, a forcing-ground of hypºcrisy:
Piety—we mean of course the pretence to piety—is “the fashion”
among some of “the most respectable people” in the place; and as
Cantis used for professional purposes, we are not surprised that trade
has availed itself of the “serious dodge,” in order to invite customers.
The following copy of a Circular has been sent to us by one of the
inhabitants, who complains that nearly all, the tradesmen in the place
are infected by the spirit of Cant that is breathed from some clerical
mouths over the whole locality.
FAMILY COAL DEPOT.
WILLIAM THOMAS, late Scripture Reader in the district of the
Rev. J. Browne, of Trinity Church, in again presenting his circular
before the Nobility, Gentry, and Inhabitants generally of Cheltenham,
desires, while acknowledging the goodness of God in prospering his
efforts in business during the past year, to express his gratitude to those
Ladies, Gentlemen, and other kind Friends, who have favoured him
with their support; and begs at the same time to assure them that he
will spare no effort to supply the best quality of Coals, at the lowest
possible prices, consistent with the principles of honesty and justice.
We confess a participation in the disgust of our Correspondent at
Religion being converted into the means of a puff, and employed for the
purpose of getting off coals, or any other article. -
if it were not that we have more reverence for Religion than those
can have who drag it into business advertisements and trade circulars,
we might suggest a variety of the most absurd incongruities arising
from the union of puffing and piety. We, however, have too high a
regard for sacred matters to allow us to imitate the conduct of those
who bring the Bible and the Ledger into unseemly contact; and though
we might render them supremely ridiculous, we are satisfied to leave
them to the contempt and good faste of the public in general... We
fear that in Cheltenham there is too much of Cant personified and
parsonified to enable us to effect much good in that home for genteel
hypocrisy and feeble-minded conventionality; but if our remarks open
the eyes of only a few, the result will be so far satisfactory.
PROTESTANTISM AND PLEASURE.
THE Birmingham Journal publishes an incoherent discourse, which
it ascribes to the REv. Thomas Tys AN, Catholic priest of Sedgley, on
the subject of mixed marriages; that is to say, marriages between
Roman Catholics and other people. MR. Tysan, according to our
Birmingham contemporary, concluded his address with the following
reflection and dogma:—
“How dreadful it is for those who troth their faith and love to each other, when
they leave their door, one going one way, and the other the other way, thinking the
one is going to the devil, and the other thinking the other is going to the devil, and so
they live on. All Protestants think of is their own gratifications, pleasures, and
selfishness; and all that is bad.” -
MR. Tysan’s reflection is judicious, but his dogma must be doubtful,
even to Roman Catholics themselves, at least until FERRETTI shall have
stamped it with the seal of infallibility. On reflection, he will himself
erceive, that his condemnation of Protestants is rather too sweeping;
or, surely, something more than their “own gratifications, pleasures,
and selfis ness,” must have been thought of by the numerous persons
of Protestant opinions who, rather than renounce them, have suffered
themselves to be burnt alive.

A NIGHT WITH CLICQUOT.
(From our own Correspondent.)
Potsdam, Nov. 8, 1855.
KING CLIcQUoT asked
yesterday, and having
no better engagement,
I accepted the invita-
tion. spent a tole-
rably pleasant evening.
We dined tâte-à-tête,
|because his Majesty
wished, as he often
does, to ascertain my
opinion on . Various
questions of European
policy.
Before dinner the
King was what we call
in the vernacular rather
down in the mouth; he
said he had been up
the night before. I re-
commended him a petit
terre, which he was dis-
inclined to take, but I
i made him, when he soon
became all right; and,
the repast having been
.. ate and drank,
particularly the latter,
as heartily as usual.
The champagne was
first-rate. state this
- - on his Majesty's au-
thority, for I stuck to Johannisberger; although he partook of both, contrary to my advice
not to mix his liquors. On the removal of the cloth, however, he yielded to my suggestion,
that the best thing he could now take was whiskey-punch; for which we had the materials
in, and I brewed a “jorum” for myself and him.
Having given the King a prime Havannah, I lighted my “weed,” and his Majesty followed
my example. We, then chatted together for some time on moral philosophy, metaphysics,
the belles lettres, table-turning, spirit-rapping, religion, and the other topics of the day, including
the Greek Tragedy of Antigone; of a ficult passage in one of the choral odes of which, I
gave my Royal entertainer the correct translation in German. -
From the subject of a Tragedy we soon i. by a natural transition, on the War; respectin
which, as his Majesty has often heard me descant concerning the wrongs of poor Old Irelan
in terms of fervid eloquence, he naturally supposed me exempt from English prejudices entirely.
He therefore unbosomed himself to me on that subject quite confidentially; and, as I have no
fear that your columns will ever meet his eye, there is no reason at i why I should not
relate you his discourse thereon. -
It was pretty late in the evening, and we were both very well primed, although for my part
there was nothing the matter with me, when I told the King how cleverly I thought he had
managed in steering clear of the Eastern scrape. “Your Majesty,” I said, “has displayed
the most brilliant management in keeping out of that.”
. “Shink so?” said §: in answer to my delicate compliment. I give his Majesty's pro-
nunciation of the English . which usually becomes peculiar as the evening advances.
...; I do, Sire,” I answered; “by Jovel Austria was very near being drawn in once
or twice.”
“Aus’ra knows wellnuff washsabout,” replied the Monarch.
verwell whatsabout. , FRANTz's upsnuff.” -
“Yes”. I remarked, “but FRITz put him up to snuff.” Hereat the King poked the fore-
finger of his Royal right hand into my small ribs, and I returned the compliment by giving
him a cordial slap on the back.
“Boseof's knows veywell whatsabout,” repeated CLICQUOT.
“Think ALEXANDER knows what he’s about?” I asked in my off-hand way.
“No!” answered his Majesty in a monosyllable.
“He seems determined to persevere in the War,” I said. “Sebastopol’s gone, and
#º ; sure he’s playing a losing game. Why doesn’t your Majesty get him to throw
it up P’
“Know a trickworth two that,” responded the King.
“Why, of course, as long as the blockade lasts, you get all the Russian trade,” I observed.
“Yesbesure,” was the Royal answer. “But 'tisn't that Ilooktosmuch—'tishn't that.”
“Austria,” I remarked, “has no such interest in the War.”
… Certainly nosh,” assented the King. “But zshash only a temp'ry inst inshwar. , Ausht’s
permaninshtst in schwar shame ash mine. Look here, olefella! Shpose Ip'suade sh'CzAR t”
accept §: tºº? Wash zshen Englanfrance and Sardinia.’spose of Turkey.”
“Yes, Sire,” I said.
-- Well, but,” resumed CLIcQUoT, “wash I want ish for Prussianausra 'spose of Turkey!
So we mean to le’m go on till zhey've ezshaushed oneanuzher, and zhenaknow we shtep in an
'vide sha prize zhey've been figh’n for, like zha whosname in zha fable.”
*By the Powers!” I exclaimed, “what a deep old file your Majesty is l’”
“I razsher shinkiam; ” replied his Majesty. “But come I shay, olefella—thish all
“FRANTz-Joseph knows
me to dine with him t
*tweenourselves.”.
I ºured him that I considered his confidence
sacred.
“Pfoundshecret !” *::::::: the King.
“Dead,” I returned, in the same tone.
“Nosh a word about sha pig, TIM,” said
CLIcQUoT.
i Divil a bit, FRITz,” said I; “nor about his
al ."
His Majesty then called upon me to sing a
song, and } gave him Nora Creina with so much
tenderness and pathos as to cause him to lie
with his face upon the table and weep. By the
time I had finished, he was buried in the arms of
Morpheus, on which, having rung the bell, I had
him carried up to bed by a nobleman in attend-
ance, and wished him good-night.
THE STRONGEST OF ALL ALLIES.
ENGLAND, France, and Sardinia, stand united in
a great Anti-Cossack league. To this triad of
nations we hope very soon to acquire the addition
of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. But there
is one other nation of which the cordial alliance
would be more effective, perhaps, than that of all
the rest in the world. That is a nation without
a geographical limit; a nation without a place
on the earth's surface; a nation partaking little
of the earth's crust, but very much of the riches
of the earth's interior; a nation interspersed
throughout all nations. Need we say that the
nation to which we allude is that of the Hebrews.
The CzAR ALEXANDER has issued an ukase for
the levy of fresh myriads, to be sacrificed, for the
success of his felonious ambition, to MoLoch.
In every thousand Jews the Tyrant has com-
manded that ten shall be seized upon, and devoted
to the slaughter among those wretched victims.
These Israelites are to be driven by the knout and
the stick to shed their own blood and that of
others, in the name and under, the tutelage of
the Muscovite's idols of wood and pain, the
carved images of his gods SERGIUs, and VLADIMIR,
and ALEXANDER NEwsKI. -
Shall not the Israelites draw the sword for this
against the oppressor of their brethren? . That is
not necessary. Iſet them only draw their purse.
strings close and tight. Let that individual of
the Hebrew community who dares to lend the
despot a farthing he cut off from the congre-
tion of IsrAE.L., To stone him to death will no
onger be practicable: but let him be thrust out
of the synagogue; and be evermore an unclean
beast; an abomination in the sight of his people.
Invitation to the Brave Belgians.
O BELGIANs bravel you ought to be
Against the Cossack our allies,
To France by consanguinity,
To England bound by jºr ties;
By ties, how strong I cannot say;
Butiam sure they’re very dear:-
The sundry thousand pounds we pay
Your Sovereign, LEoPold, a-year.
THE ROAD TO GLORY.
AMONG the decorations very properly con-
ferred by the French EMPEROR on the troops
in the Crimea, is one of a rather dubious cha-
racter, in the shape of a cross of the Legion of
Honour, to a cºrporal of Chasseurs, who had
“carried away his companions by his example.”
Considering that there are always two ways in a
field of battle, it would have been as well if the
direction in which the Chasseur carried away his
companions had been clearly indicated. Though
we have little doubt that his movement was for-
wards on the foe, it is just possible that his
enthusiasm might have been of such an awkward
sort as to have run away with him.

as he hears of most of them
for the first time—the GoTHA

THE CHELTENHAM CONJURORS.
WE, should like to know the wiseacre who drew up the annexed
advertisement:—
HELTENHAM COLLEGE.-The Present War.—It has been deter-
mined by several Cheltenham collegians, both old and present, to erect a suitable
MONUMENT in memory of their schoolfellows, who have fallen and may fall in the
present war. Any old collegian who is willing to aid this object can communicate with
the Secretary of the Memorial Committee, the College, Cheltenham.
We respect the feeling which dictates the erection of a monument to
those who “ have fallen” in the War; but we do not see how those who
“may fall” are to be included in the honour, unless the Cheltenham
worthies are gifted with, the power of prophecy. Perhaps the
REVEREND, MR. CLose, who has written on Spirit-rapping-whether
against or in favour of it we are not prepared to say—may be able to
enlighten his associates on the possibility, or otherwise, of ascertaining
the names of those about to fall, so that their names may appear with
those of the already deceased heroes on the suggested monument.
The Way to the Bank.
We see there is to be a new Omnibus Company formed in London,
and, certainly, an improvement in these vehicles of abuse is sadly
needed. If well-conducted—that is to say, if they have good conductors
—we hope this new speculation in Omnibuses will turn out as profitably
as the recent investment of Kars in Asia.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR GALLANT ALLIES-PROPOSED COMPLIMENTS.
HE Post inserted a letter from a butter-
| hearted correspondent—he signs him-
self RUSTICUs—who meekly “recom-
mends that, the name of Waterloo
Bridge should be changed in compli-
ment to our gallant and generous
brothers in arms, the French.” He
further recommends that the new name
should be the Bridge of Peace! Punch
would further recommend that the
Bridge should be called Pons Asinorum,
with free toll for the whole length
of the life (ears included) of Rus-
TICUs. Our friend may, however,
prefer his first suggestion because it
enshrines a sentiment, and want of
sentiment he declares
Saxon population of this country is
degrading the masses below the least
of any other civilised people.” The
Fins and Muscovites, for instance, in purity of politeness and intensity
of sentiment beat us hollow-hollow as a mug. -
However, we quite agree that we should wipe out all recollections
of former victories over the French; that we should destroy all an
every institution, sign or symbol that may keep alive the memory
of our little tiffs by land and sea. And first let us begin with the
House of Lords. A certain, EARL NEIson is there, who inherits
his peerage and his fortune by the good luck of being descended
(we will not say how many steps), from a certain .NELSON, who
won the Nile and the Trafalgar. , Let that earldom, be wiped out
from the peerage; the Earl's fortune, confiscated, and his name be
changed to JAcques Bon HomME. And in the like manner-we cannot
help it—we must treat the Duke or WELLINGTON. We must have
that Strathfieldsaye estate back again, the national grants reſunded,
the title abolished, and the DUKE OF WELLINGTON made plain MR.
WELLesley. SouthEY's Life of Nelson, together with every, copy
of the Wellington Despatches must be burnt, say in Leicester Fields.
Of course the Wellington Statues, with the statues of NELson must
away to the ...; whilst, as a final act, a law shall, be passed
making it a high misdemeanour to write or speak of any little squabble
that may have unfortunately happened between England and France,
later than the dispute at Poictiers or Agincourt. This, for the present,
is all that Mr. Punch can suggest; but he will very cheerfully give
ear to any further proposition for mixing the two countries into one.
He yet hopes to see the day, when cabs may pass under the tunnel
from Calais to Dover, and from Dover to Calais as thickly and withai
as safely as they pass in Fleet Street. France, we doubt it not, will
reciprocate the feeling. Indeed, she is so anxious to let bye-gones be
bye-gones, that as an opening compliment to Austria, she proposes—the
time is not yet fixed—to change the name of the Bridge of Austerlitz
to the Pont de Blucher.
HORRORS OF THE MONEY MARKET.
OLD ladies with weak nerves should beware of reading any News-
papers except those which are well known to be addressed exclusivel
to themselves. In the Paris correspondence of a contemporary, whic
appeals both to youthful and ancient females of the superior classes,
there occurs the following statement:—
“Messrs. Maitland, Cuthbeat, AND Co., in their circular of Nov. 3, observe,
* The settlement in the shares of the Crédit Mobilier has again been painful, and some
executions took place, which caused a further decline in their value.’”
This very cool and cursory manner of mentioning executions would
surely very much shock and harrow the feelings of any one of the
sensitive and venerable parties above contemplated. What is the
nature of this commercial concern, the settlement in the shares of
which has been so painful? is a question which cannot but occur to her
bewildered mind, taking “painful” in connection with “executions.”
Is it a Punishment of Offenders Company, contracting with the French
Goyernment to carry out the sentences ºf the tribunals on criminals?
Is it a Joint-Stock Society, which provides stocks, and whipping-posts,
and agents to correct culprits at the one, and invest their legs in the
...;" Does the Mobilier send guillotines about the country? These
are not pleasant speculations to be suggested, at breakfast time, to the
fancies of the grandmothers of refined society.

“THE PLAYFUL POLECATS.”
THE fact has escaped the attention alike of PETER CUNNINGHAM and
ohn TIMBs in their books of London, that there exists at the present
time a club of young fellows (it must be confessed very poor and spirit-
less imitators of the Mohawks and Bloods of the good old times),
calling themselves the Playful Polecats. The object of the society is
to illustrate the English character in all public places, in a variety of
modes and manners, that whilst they shall impart a playful air of
ruffianism to the actors themselves, shall at the same time, fill with the
most possible amount of disgust their audience and beholders. The
first meeting 'of “The Playful Polecats” takes place on the first an-
nouncement of M. JULLIEN's Concerts, the wide arena of the promenade
affording the amplest scope for the wit and repartee of even the smallest
Polecat or Polekitten. e are enabled to give a º of the circular
issued to the Members who, in default of personal attendance at the
Club-room, might nevertheless be duly instructed in the intentions of
the Society in general.
“THE PLAYFUL POLECATS.”
Brother Polecat, Old JULLIEN sports his baton and his white choker
on Monday. You are expected to meet the Playfuls, and no mistake.
|, The row is to be opened about nine. There is a Frenchwoman going
to chaunt, and won't it be jolly to our blessed Allies, just to show 'em
what bricks Britons can be, and so just as the Gallichen begins to
crow, to get up a fight? Hold your head up—like a true Polecat-
and hit low. This will conclude, the “first part.” -
| Part two will be opened with a game of leap-frog, every Polecat being
expected in his turn to make a back, and jump.
uring the Galop, a Shower of #alfpence, and a grand scramble, to
conclude with a fight!
Peas and detonating balls to be scattered and let off as our beloved
Allies say of their bread–at discretion.
| Three live hedgehogs will be flung up at the “Zouave's Trumpet
|Call,” which is expected to make a jolly lark in the way of football,
and no mistake.
| The Playfuls, are, desired to pay in their annual guinea, to the Pole-
cats' Affliction Fund; namely, to discharge the fines which inexorable
Bow Street Beaks levy on the captive Members. As FITZBALL says,
“They hates us youth.”

RUSSIAN REINFORCEMENTS.
WE should like to see enforced the following enactment:
|... “THAT all Brutes, convicted of beating their wives, be immediately on their convic-
tion enlisted in a New Regiment; to be called “The Wife Smashers," or “The Woman
| Bruisers,' and be sent out of the Kingdom as soon as possible, to fight the Russians.”
There would be only one fear of the above Law being carried out—
and the further it was carried out of the country the better—and that
is, the inhuman wretches so enlisted might turn out such poltroons, that
the mere sight of a Cossack would be sufficient to put them all to flight.
It is but fair to infer that a man, who has proved himself a rank coward
at home, would be an equal coward in the ranks abroad; and conse-
quently it would be a great risk to entrust the fº of England to such
worthless guardians. Besides, such monsters, having thrown off all the
attributes of Englishmen, have no right to appear before the enemy in
the honourable uniform of Englishmen. We would propose, therefore
that the dastardly regiment, when duly formed in the Crimea, should
retain as its distinguishing mark the prison-dress it had so well earned,
and further, that it should be allowed every opportunity, and, in fact,
iven every possible encouragement, to desert over to the Russians.
|By this arrangement, the ruffianly “ Wife:Smashers” would stand the
best chance of being severely punished by their own countrymen, and
would thus be made to feel on their own persons what it was to be
beaten within an inch of their lives. We should be ridding the
country of a disgrace, and at the same time inflicting on the Russians
a great injury. #. new Russian corps tº: out of compliment to
their secret allies, the Austrians, be called “HAYNAU's Own l’”

together, but he cannot control them.

medium—as you will see nurses administering medicine to children in
a silver spoon.

“I az yer Pard'm, but yer haven't sich a thing as a Lucifer about yer ; have yer, Missus #"
RUSSIAN OIL ON THE FIRE I
To RICHARD Cobden, Esq., M.P.
MY DEAR SIR,
How glad I should be to find you writing or º something
calculated to put a stop to this horrible War ! What could have pos-
sessed you to write that letter to MR. BAINEs, which can have no
other tendency than to prolong it? Don't you see that, in trying to
discourage the British Public, you simply encourage the CzAR, and
rouse, instead of cowing, the spirit of §. countrymen? Are you not
conscious that, in, proclaiming our difficulties, you are doing your
utmost to increase both his obstinacy in resisting our demands, and
our determination to compel him to yield to them? Those difficulties
you invite MR. John BULL to inspect, through your microscope, in
order to terrify him, don't you? Well they do terrify him; and in the
agony of his terror, he will strive desperately to surmount them, well
knowing that if he does not surmount them now, he will have much
greater difficulties to contend with hereafter. John BULL is afraid to
stop the War; endeavour to allay that fear. But ; : evidently don’t
know what fear is, rational fear; fear in the British sense of the word.
This, my dear Sir, is the fear of being beaten; which prompts those
who are affected with it to fight instead of running away.
MR. John BULL is afraid of Russian aggrandizement and domina-
tion. , MR. Richard CoBDEN is not., Now, my brave MR. CoppeN,
why don't you disabuse timid JoHN of his delusion, iſ he is deluded, on
that ; That, if you could manage it, would be the way to restore
peace. Show that Russia had not, for centuries, cherished designs
upon Turkey: that Sebastopol, with its fleet and thousands of cannon,
and enormous accumulations of shot and shell, was not intended for
their execution. Show that the arsenal was not the analogue of a
burglar's premises; and its munitions of war the counterparts ofiemmies
and centrebits. Show that the seizure of the SULTAN's dominions
would not have been followed by the conquest of Europe. Show that
the aggression on the Principalities was not the first step towards that
conquest. Demonstrate all this, and I, at least, will cry “Stop the
War!” as loud as I can squeak. Dread of ultimate subjection to
Russia; horror of slavery, Siberia, and the knout, maintains the war-
like feeling of the country. Speak or write to this question. But no.
You never do. You ignore it almost as quietly as a fact which cannot
be denied or disposed of is ignored by a controversial clergyman.

SHE's all her fancy painted her,
Her tricks you can’t divine;
First one and then another
She gets into a line.
She looks like innocence itself—
As open as the day;
But a humbug and a take in,
Is simple ALICE GRAY.
Her artless air has varnish'd o'er
The black with purest white.
Her roſt false tongue, prefers a charge,
And juries think her right.
Her artless air is all assumed—
Her victim's sent away,
And the prison crank he's turning,
Through the lies of ALICE GRAY.
I’ve seen impostors have their run
I’ve seen them caught at last;
But ALICE GRAY has all outdone—
Each humbug she’s surpass'd;
And when her story shall be told,
Truth will be forced to say,
She was the yery Queen of quacks,
That artful ALICE GRAY.
The Invasion of Paris.
Such has been the enormous number of En-

Did we not, before going to war, exhaust all the means of preserving
peace recommended by the very Peace Society?, Did we not have
recourse to arbitration; was not the award given in our favour: and
did not the CzAR refuse to submit to it? What, then; would you have

you would wish the dangerous classes, provided *; arm themselves,

arch-cateran, cut-throat, cannibal, and so forth, had chosen to fortify
his den with certain mudbanks and firearms, you would have been for
suffering him and his gang to remain unmolested? Ridiculous to com-
pare the EMPEROR OF Russia to SAwNey BFAN ? Yes; as ridiculous
as to compare Mont Blanc to Primrose Hill. The worst atrocities
º by SAwNEY BEAN and his crew, thousands of times multiplied

yes: the Press gives publicity to your letters and speeches; otherwise
it merely embodies the national sentiments for the information of your
friend, the EMPEROR of Russia, and much good may it do him! Your
letter to MR. BAINEs is very, likely to diminish any, amount of good
which the Press may be capable of doing him. By the Nº. my dear

Suppose your letter to the Editor of the Leeds Mercury had been ad-
dressed to his contemporary of the Invalide Russe ; only mutatis

and you a Russian by birth and residence, but an Englishman at heart.
Where, in the world, would you be at this moment, my dear Sir; and
what appearances would be presented by your bare back? Commending
this question to your serious consideration, believe me, my dear Sir, in

people, to guard against sur-

rom being unpleasantly as-
tonished at finding it report-
ed that, in Fº Sentence
upon one of those “brutal
assault” cases, which are be-
coming really a national dis-
grace to us:—
“MR. JARDINE said, he had not
been hitherto called upon to inflict
the full punishment authorised by
the new act in reference to these
brutal assaults upon women, but
this was one of the worst cases he
had ever heard of. The prisoner
* must be committed to hard labour
: for six months."
The “full punishment”
which the law has prescribed
; for these cases is considered
jº'ſ to be at most a
rather homoeopathic dose.;
and the frequency of their
---
given, is a sufficient proof, we
think, that it is not severe
enough to act as a preven-
| tive. But of course its effi-
cacy must be much dimin-
ished, when those who should
administer, it shrink from
fully doing so; and although some cases may demand a milder treat-
ment than others, we will venture to say, that since the *. of the
act, . have been few which have not merited the full punishment
it inflicts.
Now Bow Street is not the least frequented of police-courts, and we
doubt not, has received at least its average proportion of assault-cases,
since the ſaw for their prevention has come into force. We are sur-
prised therefore when we hear its magistrate asserting, that he “has
not yet been called upon” for the six months' hard ſabour, which is
the sentence he is fully authorised to pass. We are puzzled indeed to
know by whom MR. JARDINE expects ever to be “called upon” for
punishment. Can he fancy that a criminal, struck perhaps by the dis:
proportion of his punishment to his offence, would spontaneously call
upon the sitting magistrate to double it Or has he been waiting all
the time since the passing of the act, to be called upon by somebody
with instructions to direct him when fully to administer it? For our:
selves, not inclining to either of these suppositions, we are certainly of
opinion that justice, like charity, is not good for much if it waits till it
is called upon.
Retirement from Parliament.
It is rumoured that, in the event of SIR CHARLEs NAPIER being
returned for Southwark, SIR JAMEs GRAHAM will make an application
on the very first day of the re-assembling of the House, to be appointed
Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. We hope there is no truth in the
above report, as the retirement of SIR JAMEs would be lamented by a
large class of people, who have been looking forward with the greatest
anxiety to the meeting of Parliament, in the hope that it would con-
tribute in no small degree to the amusement one naturally expects at
º: of the year. The absence of SIR JAMEs would

“ DESTRUCTION | *
We have arrived at the knowledge—certain and minute-of the
approaching destruction of three or four distinguished printsellers.
Altogether there are about half-a-dozen intellectual tradesmen who make
their daily bread (the butter is hardly worth speaking of) by the sale of
'engravings from the pictures of our own glorious English artists. Now,
these gentlemen, reasoning doubtless on the most correct principle that,
things become the more precious as they become the more scarce, have,
for the furtherance of the interests of true art, resolved to lessen the
number of printsellers by at least one half. If half-a-dozen Boys are
valuable, how much more priceless will be three Boys P. If two Moons
are a great social advantage, how much more useful, more socially É.
fitable will one Moon be; or even a half-Moon? We have seen flow
successfully, how admirably this principle has been carried out by the
chopping into little bits, plates of “Waterloo Banquets,”“Sanctuaries,”
“Deerstalkers,” and so forth, and, having great faith in the logical
É. of all artists soever, we have no doubt that by the contemplated
estruction of one half of the number of printsellers at present ‘...;
the value of the fortunate survivors will be, as predicted, incalculably
enhanced. Be this as it may, their fate is decided; though, we are
happy to state, that the chosen victims will not, like the doomed plates,
be first disfigured, “ploughed into deep indelible lines,” to be finally
“cut in pieces by machinery.” No; they will be tenderly put out of
the way; being made to retire at once from business and from life by
means of painless extinction.
Various R.A.’s and, A.R.A.'s are pledged to the good work. ... The
gifted painters of “The Princess and the Pet Guinea-Pigs,” “The
|Curl Papers,” “Chaos,” “The Unheaved Sigh,” and “The Ungushed
Tear,” with other artists, equally distinguished, are mutually bound to
this act of enlightened destruction. "Čards have already been sent to
the unsuspecting victims, to meet the sacrificial artists to a genial
banquet at the Goose and Gridiron.
Feeling very warmly for the success of the attempt, Mr. Punch would
not have risked the publication of the design that, by the sacrifice of
the three men, is to enhance the value of the three print-selling sur-
vivors, had not Mr. Punch been assured that the work of enlightened
destruction will have been some hours completed before the appearance
of his journal. The mortal banquet will be of the most choice descrip-
tion. Professional singers are ; and will execute a dirge and a
requiem. Mutes and bearers from BAYNTUM's will, on the occasion,

“NOW, BOYS 1"
AMONgst the lives of Celebrated Boys, now being published in a
certain Boy's Magazine, we miss the
“LIFE of JIMMY GRAHAM :—THE DIRTY Boy, who was always in a mess.”
It might be made very instructive, and we should like extremely to
write it. The moral would, of course, be very impressive: ‘You must
not dabble in dirt, like that naughty, boy JIMMY GAAHAM, or else you
will certainly get into mischief, and be shunned by all good men.”
By the bye, since we have got the Boys in hand, we think an Old Boy's
Magazine would at the present moment be a most profitable speculation.
It should be dedicated to the juvenile octogenarians at the War Office,
Admiralty, and other Government Offices, and might be filled with
Ciceronian essays inculcating the advantages of Old Age, and proving
how necessary it was to have the gout before one could take a step in
official life. Such a boyish Magazine could not fail to be popular with
our Ministers, who are so fond of rewarding aged incapacity, that they

with a quickness and an accuracy that makes him ashamed of his male
pupils); but he will illustrate the way in which the lawyers deal with
such matters, by making an ordinary article of lady's use the subject of
a conveyancer's treatment.
MRs. Swansdown (née MARIA GoosingtoN) has an old-fashioned
Work-table, beautifully painted, and inlaid with silver. It belonged to
her grandmother, who received it as a present from the grateful wife
of a young officer (a friend of the Pretender's), to whom Granny, then
a romantic young FLORA. M'Ivor, gave shelter after Culloden. MRs.
Swansdown's pet daughter is married; and her husband, MR. FondLE-
squaw, wants to give his mother-in-law a splendid Epergne in exchange
for this Work-table, which his wife, from childish association, desires to
possess. All parties are agreed, but (we write as if the two articles of
roperty had acquired the dignity of land) the arrangement must be made

kind of observations:-
“The title to the Work-table, subject to the following remarks, seems
satisfactory.
“You must obtain evidence to prove, that the lady who presented it

“If she is living, I think her declaration to that effect would do;
but, as she was no doubt 20 at the gift, and this is 109 years ago, this
would make her 129, and she may therefore be deceased, and her
representatives must be sought for. -
“The letter presenting the table is dated Amiens, in France. See if
you can get any evidence of her having been seen to post the letter.

“I do not think that the Table went through the post; but, as this
depends on French law, obtain the opinion of a Parisian advocate on
the subject. (Translate this for me, as I only understand Norman
French, such as sur conuzance de droit comme ceo, &c.)

engagement, cannot go to the Mons., it is quite right of the Mons.
to go to the Italian Opera.
We were happy to find that our Mons.—the Monarch of Music-
unlike the Monarch of Mountains, is not yet crowned with a diadem of
$now, for his luxurious locks retain all their ancient resemblance to the
jet of the most brilliant blacking. His hair has, in fact, all the dark
and dazzling polish of other Days and MARTINs, and it is delightful to
witness the freshness and vivacity with which he still wields the baton.
We have, however, a crow to pick with the Mons:—
a certain drama. What name shall be given to M. JULLIEN’s last per-
formance? He has brought out a Quadrille, the theme whereof is the
“Fall of Sebastopol,” and the music whereof, to which we are to dance
and smirk, and flirt, is intended to represent the various noises hear
during the final struggle. We are unaware whether it is yet published
for the pianoforte, but in due course the young ladies will no doubt
have it, with a splendidi fiery frontispiece, representing Sebastopol in
red flames, and in the . some adorable officers (with wasp-
like waists) raising the standards of the Allies. For Art-pictorial and
Art-musical are sisters.
Looking at the º with a practical eye, and a recollection of
divers, First Sets, and the duty to be done therein, we seem to see a
little difficulty in the way of any eight or sixteen couples who may call
3. for “The Sebastopols.” One of the subjects is “Dialogue of the
hiefs during the passing the banks of the beautiful Tchernaya.” This
might possibly be adapted to the dialogue of the partners during the
performance of the beautiful pas seul. “The cavalry gradually dis-
appears,” may be a hint to a gentleman to hope that a lady's hoarseness
is going off. But after the business begins in earnest, and the themes
so appropriate to a ball-room or theatre (where is scarcely an individu
who has not mourned relative or friend lost in the fray now set to the
fiddles) are being fairly worked ºutſ when the French “rush with the
rapidity of an eagle,” and the “gallant English fall by hundreds, and
dig. like, heroes”—we do not see how the setting, and turning, and
ladies' chain illustrate the subject. Nor, though “the roar of the cannon,
the whistling, of the bullets, the cries of the fugitives, and the ships
blown into the air,” may, according to M. JULLIEN’s charming phra-
seology, “form an Awful Fête,” (does he mean a pun ?) it does not
seem exactly aféte dansante. Then, too, in the finale, “a soldier mortally
wounded, is borne up a hill and prays,”&g., at length “dying happy;”
a º: which must, one would think, be treated in slow time; an
a little out of place in the galop at the end of the Quadrille; nor should
|
|
we care to hear “Now, then, Mortally Wounded, all round.”
Such a theme for a Quadrille must surely, have been selected in
deference to the*f; who acted as jackals to the swell-mob on the
opening night of M, JULITEN's Concerts. , English society has not yet
learned to like its Quadrille music mixed up with blood, and groans,
and tears, and must, condemn the bad taste that found in the terrible
incidents of a siege the materials for an Awful Fête.
Nothing can be more perfect than the manner in which JULLIEN
-Reeps his excellent orchestra together, but there are many imperfec-
tions in the º: which he-or rather his servants—get his audience
together; for there is a want of harmony between the seats in the

theatre and the plan in the box-office. Having taken your places for a

booking-office, you may find yourselves all scattered when you get into
the house; , and thus, some of the tenderest ties in life—those of
husband and wife, or father and child—are, for one evening at least,
most cruelly severed. . The Mons, in spite of his exaltation, is always
ready to stoop to meet the wishes of the public; and a nod of his head
H. probably be sufficient to remedy the evil we have pointed out to
-
HOMILIES AND HOAXES.
ERE used to be a great deal said about “wolves
in sheep's clothing”—the wolf of that species
meaning a bad style of clergyman. We do not
ear so much of these wolves, now: there are one
or two to be met with here and there; for instance
on certain County Benches; but it may be hoped
that this breed of wolves will soon become as ex-
tinct in these dominions as the fourfooted. If,
however, clerical wolves are scarce, there is no
great lack, apparently, of another sort of ecclesi-
astical animals. Witness the following advertise-
ment, extracted from the Times:—
D CLERUM. NEW LITURGICAL ISSUE
by the Author and Editor of “The Churchman's Sunday
Evenings at Home,” “The Devout Churchman,” “Sermons
for Sundays and Holy Days,” &c. The Rev. ALExANDER
WATson, A.M., having been often applied to by his brethlen
in connection with the subject of the present advertisement,
now invites attention to a proposal for the circulation of a
limited number of a course of manuscript sermons adapted
to the Divinely ordered system of the Church's Ritual; viz.,
a set for one year of manuscript sermons setting forth the
faith and practice of the Christian man in exact accordance with the Divinely appointed
order of the Church's Annual Cycle.
Here we pause; for at this point the existence of those other animals
than wolves among the clergy becomes manifest. It is evident that
there are a great many 3. in holy orders; donkeys so stupid and
so lazy as to be either unable, or unwilling, even to write their own
sermons. M.R. WATson has “been often applied to by his brethren in
connection with the subject” of having that work done for them. He
isplays some humility, to be sure, in owning them his brethren—in
fraternising with such a long-eared kind of parsons. But let him now
proceed—the issue of his cut-and-dried spiritual provender is
“To be continued annually, until each portion of the Liturgical Services for each
Sunday and Holy Day shall have been illustrated and their united scope enforced.
The advertiser is ready to issue the first number of the above series in time for the
ensuing Advent Sunday, with sermons for the Saint's day which fixes the date of
Advent Sunday, if he receives the names of a sufficient number of subscribers to
protect him from loss before November 23rd, 1855. Terms for the first series, seven
guineas per annum, paid in advance, or the Sunday sermons may be had separately
price five guineas; and those for Holy Days, price three guineas. Only a limited
number of copies of each series will º in circulation, due regard being had to the
number issued in any one neighbourhood; and where desired the strictest secresy will
be observed. The sermons will be sent post free in packets of a season, or a month, as
the case may be. Subscribers' names, with particulars of remittance, to be for-
warded,” &c., &c.
What business has a jackass, who is such an ass that he cannot
compose his own sermons, in the pulpit? The only assignable excuse
for his occupancy of that position is, that he is gifted with a peculiarly
impressive bray, a tºº. and solemn hee-haw : insomuch that the
truths worded by the wisdom of other men “fall mended from his
tongue.” . Be it, so; but let the donkey stand there professedly for
what he is, to bray, simply, in an edifying manner: to read the Rev.
MR. WATson, or the Rev. Mr. Punch, as condescending Noblemen
and Gentlemen sometimes read SHAKSPEARE at Mechanics’ Institutes.
It is a swindle on the part of a preacher to palm off somebody else's
sermon as his own; and besides being an ass, as aforesaid, the utterer
of such a discourse is the utterer of spiritual forged notes; a reverend
impostor, an ordained cheat, and a consecrated humbug.
f_course MR. WATson has as, much right to sell sermons, as
Mr. Punch has to sell jokes. . But what if Mr. Punch were to publish
a series of manuscript conundrums, for the express *W. of enabling
dunces to palm themselves off on society as wits ould not Mr.
Punch, the layman, incur rather general contempt?. How much more
contempt would the Rev. Mr. Punch incur by publishing sermons for
the analogous purpose of abetting asses in the personation of divines.
Qf course the object of the publication of these sermons in manu-
script is to cause them to be mistaken for the preacher's own compo-
sitions: to make believed the thing which is not. Therefore “due
§. will be had to the number issued in any one neighbourhood.”
Qf course; to preclude the possibility of the delivery of one of these
“crib” compositions being occasionally interrupted by a cry of
: Halloal—we heard that in tºother church this morning.”. No doubt,
“the strictest secresy will be observed.” The Party, will keep dark
tº: ; Plant. A very pretty system this, certainly, for preaching

COMPANION TO THE LATCH-KEY.
..If anybody happens to be returning to his abode late at
night, or, early in the morning, in or about London, what
course is he to pursue?, That of going straight home, if
º: appears to be the obvious answer to this question.
ere are two other courses, however, open to the belated
individual. One of these is that of taking a cab, and the
other is that of carrying a revolver. If the former is not
adopted, the latter should be; for the unarmed nocturnal
pedestrian in this metropolis runs a very considerable risk
of becoming the subject of a garotte robbery. A cab will
rotect him from the foot ºbut it will not protect him
rom the cabman; and as the price of a revolver would
soon made up by the saving of extortionate cab-hire, whilst
the weapon would remainto be shown and used if necessary,
therefore it would come cheaper than the vehicle in the
end. If the aid of the Police could be depended upon at
call, there would be no necessity for either, but under
existing circumstances one or the other is indispensable.
For the reason #. stated, we prefer the revolver, and
pending the amelioration of police arrangements, recom-
mend it as a constant companion to the latch-key.
MILITARY REVIEW.
PRUDENT RESOLVE,
Little Party. “Go AND walk In HYDE PARK ?
OH, AH !—I DESSAY –AND GET
PELTED For A HARISTochat?–No THANK'E–Not IF. I know IT.”
F. M. PRINCE ALBERT passed in review, on Thursday last,
the PRINce of WALEs’s Infantry, in the back nursery of
Buckingham Palace. The force, which was drawn out in
battle array one deep on the slate of His Royal Highness,
consisted of half a squadron of wooden cavalry §:
“Spotted Reds º and a full battalion of tin infantry (the
“Painted Flats”). The latter excited great interest, as
they had only the day before been rescued from a fierce
fire, in the midst ºf which they must have perished to a
man, by the Royal nurse discovering them just in time in
the thick of the coal-scuttle. The troops were put through
their several evolutions by His Royal Highness, assisted
in the most playful manner by his little brothers and sisters,
and were afterwards complimented by F. M. the Prince
upon their neat and soldier-like ap ce.
At the termination of the review, fresh colours were
presented to a yeteran Sergeant, who had become
quite pale in the face from falling accidentally into the
water-jug.
THE UNCIVIL CIWIL SERVICE.
It is a subject of very general remark, that it is difficult to find a
subordinate in the Civil Service who has got a civil tongue in his head.
The Post-office authorities have hit upon a happy expedient at the
Money Order Office in Charing Cross, where written directions are
placed in front of the bars, behind, which the bears are to be heard
growling, out their indistinct replies to any question that may be
addressed to them. . We recommend every one who applies for, a
money-order at Charing Cross to read the written, directions, if he
wishes to avoid the surliness and º to which he will pro:
bably be “tº if he ventures to ask one of the Civil servants a civil
question. We strongly recommend the adoption of the same system at
other Government offices; for there is undoubtedly much more polite-
ness in printer's ink—notwithstanding its black looks-than is generally
to be met with from the lips of official underlings. Perhaps their pay
may be unreasonably low, but we are quite sure that the public would
not object to the “iwo-pence more,” which, according to the old anec.
dote, is the normal price at which instruction in manners may be
acquired.
STOPPAGE OF THE TIMES.
WE read in the ecstatic Post that—
“At a meeting of the Oxford Union Debating *. held on Monday night, the
subject under consideration was, “That the Times has deserved well of this country.'
To this an amendment was proposed, “That the Times exercises a pernicious influ-
ence, and is unworthy of our sympathies, which was carried by a majority of 6—the
numbers being 28 to 22."
In consequence of this important decision, we are requested to state,
that the proprietors of the Times will continue that journal so long only
as is necessary to keep faith with subscribers who have paid in advance.
It will then be discontinued, in obedience to the fiat of the above 28
Qxford lads, and its, connection, (somewhat a large one) will be
§:.." is supposed, between the Morning Herald and the Poultry
Chronicle.
THE RE-"PUBLIC” OF LETTERS.
F we are to believe its own state-
ments, there is no journal so
well informed on all Ministerial
matters, as our contemporary
the Morning Advertiser, who so
foamingly and characteristically
...; º: hº -- #. the
great beer interest. It is, perha
natural that a mixed §.
like the present one, should adopt
as its º: in the p
a journal with which Hºſt
is closely identified. The Morning
Advertiser, accordingly, professes
to make itself the organ—the
great beer-barrel organ—of all the
movements and intentions of the
- Ministry... We can fully under-
stand the plausibility of the assumption by which the literary embodi-
ment of the tap asserts its acquaintance with everything that is on the
tap-is. We do not know whether the writers of the Morning Advertiser
are admitted to the society of the Premier 3, but, if anyone could draw
him out, or draw him off, it would, probably, be some one cognisant
of the bar-practice of the publicans.

2. “I’ll send that to Punch.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ETIQUETTE FOR THEATRICAL CRITICS.
He great success of the various little
books for teaching good manners to
everybody, and the great quantity of good
manners which are prevalent in conse-
) quence of the study of those works, have
induced Mr. Punch to put together a few
hints for the use of theatrical critics, in
order that the rising generation of writers
of that class may not be behind their age.
He has based these hints upon very
careful examination of the dramatic and
musical notices by the most distinguished
critics of the day, and he can assure the
young gentlemen who are training for
the judicial function (in so far as such a
trifle as sitting in judgment may be held
to require training) that, they will be
perfectly safe in following accredited
models.
In noticing an opera, of other musical work.never ##" the noise
was unbearable: say that the composer displayed is ability of
developing to the full all the resources of the orchestra.
If an actor is an abominable stick, do not use so, coarse an ex-
pression; say that he rendered the part intellectually, rather than
theatrically.
. When an author produces a dull, stupid play, full of prosy talk
instead of action: say that the literary element somewhat predominated
over the dramatic.
When an actor rants like a maniac'., say that he avails himself of his
singular physical advantages, with a determination that shows he has
formed, and can adhere to, a definite idea of the traditions of
melodrama. -
When an author writes the baldest of balderdash, without a poetical
hrase, or a pointed repartee, and merely works, up to hack “situa-
ions:”, say that if somewhat conventional, the structure of, the
drama shows that the writer has much experience, and has studied the
*#. of the stage. - - -
fan actor takes a part for which he is physically unfitted, and of
which he makes an atrocious mull: say that he exerted himself credit-
ably, but would, perhaps, not have been less welcome to the audience,
in a character more akin to his ordinary personations.
When a new production or revival is all gilt gingerbread and u
holstery: say that the splendour of the spectacle left you little time for
the ungracious consideration that, had the drama been stronger, the
whole affair would have been faultless.
When, on the other hand, it is got up in a skimping, beggarly manner,
with no attention either to effect or to accuracy; say that the manager
relied, and not in vain, upon the intrinsic merits, or long established
º of the drama itself, and appealed to the intellect rather than
the eye.
When atheatre is chock full of “double orders,” whose bearers are
sent to clap and stamp from the rise of the curtain to its fall: say that
the favourable, verdict of a first night is sometimes qualified, subse:
quently; but that there could be no doubt of the enthusiasm manifested
throughout the whole performance.
If, again, the theatre is half empty, and the piece falls flat; say
that no factitious excitement had been sought to be created, and that
the silent attention with which the drama was received, must have been
eminently fº to the author, and to actors who desire to be really
*Hºº rather than blindly applauded. -
f an author has stolen a French piece bodily, and merely upset
it out of good French into bad English: say that his object was to set
before the London public a faithful transcript of what is enchanting
*iº. of Paris.
he >
au contraire, (as he would write) he “adapts” it, that is, to say,
changes, M. DUPONT, into. SMITH, CoQUELICOT into SAM
Snoggs, and, the Bal Mabille into Cremorne; say that the felicitous
mode in which he has transplanted scene and characters almost entitles
him to the honours of originality.
And, in a word, contrive, by avoiding all straightforward expression
of opinion, to escape the one great crime, the “giving offence.” So shall
actors, authors, composers, and managers “nod to you and do you
courtesies,” and so shall you be d ed “an exceedingly fair and
liberal critic.”

Quarter of an Hour between his being told that Angelina
would be down in a Minute, and his getting her over the

A WOICE FROM THE WAN.
THE final Old Bailey defence has been made;
The final Old Bailey fee has been paid;
On the final º: sentence has past,
And the Old Bailey session is over at last.
The Pentonville Yan at Newgate stair,
Has received its freight of felon fare,
Androlls on its way through london's roar
With a blue on the box, and a blue at the door.
In each of three cells of that Pentonville Wan,
Is sitting a highly respectable man,
All snug and smooth, and one of the three
With an unctuous mask of piety-
And each as he jolts on his narrow shelf,
Is communing nervously thus with himself:
ntility, and Christian humility
“Here's business and !
ATEs, whose awful fates have shock'd respecta-
sº PAUL, and
ility.
Whose decent gig, so trim and trig, now lies a wreck most scaley,
From having met a sad upset at the bar of the Old Bailey.
Down in the dirt, with serious hurt to its inmates, hath sunk low,
Beneath the thaw of equal Law the ancient house of SNow!
“What little bird will tell us, shall we go in black and yellows?
Wear prison slops and prison crops, like our felonious fellows?
Beforced to swallow ‘skilly, and warm, ourselves when chilly
With a turn at the crank, or the treadmill, willy-nilly.
Must our friends—humiliatingſ—if they call, all through a grating,
Accompanied obligato by Policeman X in waiting.
In short, will our gentility and late respectability,
Procure for us attention and something like civility,
Or will justices and Home Office, cow’d by the Press that flout us,
Put us upon the level of the wretches round about us?”
Then to BATEs, the man of business, said STRAHAN the man of º,
“In Pentonville, nor crank nor wheel, º the prisoners' leisure,
Each in his cell, the convicts dwell and find their sole enjoyment
In weaving, cobbling, tailoring, or other mean employment.
These vulgar ways ºf killing time may suit what's call'd the masses,
But they ne'er were meant for convicts of the superior classes.
No craft is ours to cheat the hours, yet as men of business training,
P. The whole day long in laziness we can't think of remaining.
You know who will find mischief still for idle hands to do;
So say, my friend, how you intend, to get the twelve hours through.”
Then to STRAHAN, the man of ſº said BATEs the man of businesse
“I can’t say that, on that head, I feel the least uneasiness.
Making a mat or coat or hat, true I don't know the way to,
But there is one kind of industry that I am quite au fait to.
Familiar with every form of extensive cash transaction,
In keeping of the prison-books I shall sure give satisfaction.”
But pious PAUL a groan let fall, like a wheezy pair of bellows,
As that babe of grace reproved his brace of carnal-minded fellows.
“A heathen Turk might talk of work in our sad situation,-
I’ll spend my days in prayer and praise, and pious meditation:
I’ll ask to be flogg’d privately, as out of use the lash is;
For a suit of sackcloth I’ll apply, and a skuttle full of ashes.
The storm that breaks the stubborn oak still spares the pliant sapling;
And now-a-days there's mothing pays like gammoning the chaplin.
It’s very queer if, eer a year is out, my deep repentance
Haven’t purchased from the Home öffice remission of my sentence;
In Pentonville I really feel none but sinners long need lodge, my friends;
So, if you can, adopt my plan, and come the pious dodge, my friends.”

LORD JOHN AT CONFESSION.
IORD John, Russº has been lecturing the #. at Exeter
Hall on the subject of “the Obstacles to Moral and Political Progress.”
He attributed many of the “obstacles” in question to the conduct of
governments, and as he has been for a considerable portion of his life a
member of a government, his lecture must be regarded as a confession
of his own obstructiveness. There was something of satire in the
observation of the HoN. and Rev. Montagus WILLIERs, that “ev
act of Lord John RussRLI's life had been of service to his country.”
We presume that his repeated acts of resignation, are included in the
serviceable doings of the Noble Ex-Premier, and Ex-Secretary of State
for every department.

a building in London that has, throughout the
whole of its long tolerant career, been less of an
obstacle in the way particularised, we should
say it was decidedly Exeter Hall. It is quite a
Temple of Liberty, and LoRD John is in every
sense worthy to be its Prophet !
THE LORDLING'S LECTURE MANIA.
An interesting Lecture was delivered yesterday at the Pumpwater
Young Men's Mutual Instruction Society by LoRD Fitz-MoUNTEBANK,
on the subject of Entomology.
The noble lord prefaced his observations on the subject-matter of his
discourse by the expression of his sense of inadequacy to the task
which he had undertaken. The term Entomology was derived from the
Greek, and meant “talk about insects.”. It might be said that insects
were small things; but it was no small thing to talk about them.
Insects, from the remotest times, had attracted the attention of phi-
losophers. ARISTOTLE had penned some valuable observations on them
which were unfortunately lost. There were good grounds also for
believing that PLINY THE EIDER, had written much that was highly
important on the *::: of insects. Insects were well known to the
Egy tianº; the beetle was an insect, and the Egyptians worshipped
beetles. To worship a black beetle was ridiculous; but was it not
quite as absurd to worship Mammon P. Those who lived in glass-houses
should not throw stones, although it was to be admitted that the
Crystal Palace at Sydenham was a marvellous edifice. The web of the
spider was a wonderful contrivance, and its meshes were, to the con:
templative mind, suggestive of the arts of diplomacy. No one could
look at an ant's nest without having suggested to him the idea of an in-
dustrious community, and a community not only industrious but sober.
Now let them compare the ant with the fly. The fly was always
etting into #. and the consequence, a premature termination of
is career. The blue-bottle was a j the bee an example.
The early bird picked up the worm...The tardylocomotion of the snail
and the slug might remind them of the old coaches, though they might
also, perhaps, be suggestive of Parliamentary trains, and possibly of
farliamentary proceedings. A species of caterpillar produced silk, in
the state of raw material, and, so far, resembling a leg of mutton as
delivered by the butcher. The earwig was an insect to which might be
applied the prºverb, current respecting dogs—“give a dog an ill-name
and hang him.” The earwig did not, as the vulgar belief was, crawl
through people's ears into their brains. This, if he might be pardoned
the observation, was a ; The chirp of the cricket on the hearth
had been described as a arly pleasing, and he dared say it was, but,
in the position which it was his lot to occupy, that music was seldom
heard. No station, however, could exempt any man from the attacks
thus much he would say, that he hoped our enemies the Russians
besides the infestations to which they were habituated, would, each o
them, at the conclusion of the stupendous contest in which, they are
engaged with us, find himself with what is popularly termed “a flea in
his ear.” The Noble Lord, on resuming his seat, was loudly cheered.

tion of imbecile Lords as our
Ministers—a Peerage being ap-
parently the very best Title a
man can show for office.
Again, there is, leaving the
i reins of power in the hands of a
few Whig and Tory families—it
being long a favourite delusion
that the Constitution would not
be safe unless a GREY, or a RUS-
SELL, or a DERBY was driving it.
Another obstacle, just as mis-
chievous in its effects, is the
appointment of old women as

are guilty of abroad.
There are other little obstacles, that LoRD
John might cursorily have touched upon, such
as the nepotism that prevails in the distribution
of all Government favours. Our mock Field-
Marshals, who have never smelt powder, except
at a royal salute-class-legislation-unequal
representation—and the practice of petty tyran-
nies, such as your Sunday Beer Bills, and the
observance of bitter Sabbaths. There are, also, .
the Whig and Tory parties, who have always
been squabbling for power, instead of contending
for the welfare of their country.
To the above might be added the absurd
obstacle of long speeches; but to have touche
ever so slightly upon the latter, LoRD JoHN
would inevitably have made his speech three
times, as long, and we do not think that such
a beginning would have promised much to miti
gate the evil.
THE SOMERSET HOUSE CLOCK AGAIN.
WE understand there is some intention, among
the parties interested, to bring this Clock under
the Winding-up Act. At present the hands are
out of employ, and the works are at a stand-
still. It is believed that when the case of the
Clock is thoroughly looked into, the balance
will be found to be on the wrong side. . We
really cannot help thinking, that very little indul-
gence can be claimed for the Clock, which has
been allowed to take its own time; and though
it is true that the meeting of the hands at
twelve led to a strike, there is a great deal that
is wrong on the face of it. o books have

LITERARY INTELLIGENCE,
(From our own Clairvoyant.)
EveR anxious to maintain our position as the leading journal of lite-
rature (as of everything else), we have succeeded lately in completing
an arrangement, which we consider will be very highly calculated to
support our supremacy, With our usual utter regardlessness of expense,
where the interests of the public (and our own) are at stake, we have
secured the services of an eminent Clairvoyant, whose assistance, we
anticipate, will enable us, from time to time, to see into the middle of
the literary next week. We shall thus have the power of forestalling
the announcements of the Grub Street º and of dealing a
death-blow to those puffs of the publishers, by which the public first
gets wind of new forthcoming works.
That our intelligence will always be most thoroughly exclusive may
be inferred, we fancy, from the sample we intend at once to furnish:
for we think we may with confidence assure our readers, that of the
books we are now privileged to promise them, not a single one has yet
been even thought of by the writer. In authorship, however, as well
as in conveyancing, it is a matter of extreme importance now-a-days to
make a good title; for it has been ascertained that a large class of
| readers may be caught by one as readily as a plebeian millionnaire. It
will, therefore, be as clear as Thames' water (which we take to be the
current synonym for mud at present) that, when a work has gained a
share of pºpularity, its writer thinks it policy to follow up the hit; and
a titular plagiary becomes as sure a sequitar as is the nightmare to a
supper of pork-chops. -
e imagine, then, the º: will have little cause for wonder, if the
pen which lately furnished us with Notes on Noses should be nibbed
afresh for writing us some Letters upon Lips; nor, we apprehend, will
The Tulip, and the Drone be found deserving of less notice than The
Lily and the Bee. In connection also with this latter insect we are re-
minded, by a natural transition of ideas, that A Jarof Honey from Mount
Hybla might be followed very aptly by A Pot of Pickles from Snow Hill,
... We cannot promise much addition just, at present to our illustrated
| literature: but it would not much astonish us if the hand which lately
Fº those Purple Tints from Paris should depict in like manner a

truthful one, could not well be too highly coloured. Neither should we

irregular.
as the lately published Provocations of Madame Palissy; while, as a
statistical work, the Lexicon of Lemons might appropriately follow the
Dictionary of Dates.
With the exception of the birth of MR. MACAULAY's twin volumes,
our historical novel readers have just now not much to look for. Those,
however, who take pleasure in narratives of suffering may expect to
find one soon in the Confessions of a Bishop, in which, it is believed, ther
writer will reveal a few of the privations he has suffered since the time
of his promotion from the ranks of the working clergy. This reeord of
episcopal experience will have a second title of Smoothing it in the Lawn,
in antithesis to the widely known Roughing it in the Bush.
AN UNPARDONABLE OMISSION.
T. R. GLApston E, in his Lecture on the “Colonies,”
said, that of the topics called forth on this subject,
he might
“Mention the discovery of gold in Australia—the laws that
govern and regulate emigration—the history of negro slavery,
and the means by which it had been brought to an end—the
treatment of the aboriginal tribes in the various settlements
of this great empire—and to name but one more, the transpor-
tation of criminals to our distant possessions.”
We think Mr. GLADston E might have mentioned
still one more topic; and, considering that it was
the thought evidently uppermost in his mind, it is
surprising to us how the talented lecturer so care-
fully omitted all allusion to it. The topic we refer
to is, “The APPoINTMENT of MR. GLADstoNE As
MINISTER FOR THE ColoniEs.” He might have
divided it into three heads:–the past, the present
and the future. MR. GLADstoNE has been Colonia
Minister; and,curiously enough at the very time of
the Lecture, England was without a Colonial Minis.
ter! So, without disparagement to the vacancy, MR. GLADstonºmight
have fitted the three heads of his discourse in such an inferential manner,
as to allow them to fall gracefully on to the shoulders of himself. The
purport of his long speech would not have been in the least impaired
whilst it would have gained considerably in self-laudation and
Gladstonian candour. -

EARLY in the new year we are promised a total reform of
the present omnibus system. The omnibuses themselves
will, it is said, be turned inside out; and the omnibus
drivers and conductors will become so refined and cour-
teous that even the wives of their bosoms will hardl
know them. We are to owe all this to the benign an
enterprising example of our gallant Allies. As in Paris,
all the London omnibuses will form only one company;
and, a preliminary fourpence being paid, an extra penny
will take the enlightened traveller § any other omnibus to
any other point. The imaginative and vivacious author of
Heliondé, or book of the Sun, especially remarks upon those
in the planet Sol, whom on “this †† spot named earth”
we call “cabmen, cads, conductors, and omnibus-drivers.”

THE “SPREAD " OF WEGETARIANISM.
UR old friends, the Vegetarians, have
been enjoying, a tremendous feed of
“green meat” at Birmingham. We
have no objection to the consumption
of any amount of herbage by these
graminivorous enthusiasts; but we
must protest against their toasting
the QUEEN in iced water; a pro-
ceeding which is calculated to throw
an almost death-like chill into eve
loyal bosom: Iced water, at this
time of year is, of itself, sufficient to
break sociality into shivers; but all
- the springs of feeling appear to be
congealed, , when, we hear of the
health of our Sover EIGN, having been drunk in this uncomfortable
beverage, . Putting aside the disloyalty of the very freezing politeness
exhibited towards HER MAJESTY, there were some points of interest
abºut the Vegetarian Banquet. Among the stars of the evening were
four gentlemen, whose united ages amounted to 263 years, 178 of
which had been spent in advocating Vegetarian principles.” It is diffi.
cult to understand the arithmetic, by whose rules 178 years can have
been consumed by, any number of living individuals. According to
such a mode of calculation, half-a-dozen pickpockets, committed for
three months, might argue, that, when they had “served” their four-
teen :each, their period of three months' imprisonment would be
completed.
Perhaps, however, the most remarkable feature of the whole affair
was the presence of a Vegetarian Alderman, who declared that for forty
}: he had lived upon cabbage-leaves, onions, arrowroot, stuffin
erbs, and other garden produce. We must confess that we :
with a mixture of surprise and admiration the man who, while holding
an office essentially identified, with the º of almost every
living thing that is calculated to form a plāt, should have reached a
green old age in the quiet enjoyment of his apples, oranges, nuts, and
W. other kindred esculents. We do not wish to disturb the
egetarians in their ruminant propensities, and if we cannot sympathise
with them in their abstinence from animal food, we will not grudge
them their indulgence in the delicacies of the kitchen garden. it is
the fashion in these days to popularise principles by lectures and vocal
entertainments, we would suggest to the Wegetarians, the propriety of
engaging some favourite performer or singer to visit the Literary Insti-
tutions of the country with a sort of Monopolylogue, called
A BUNCH of GREENs, or A NIGHT WITH A MARKET GARDENER.
Such an entertainment, with gastronomical illustrations, in the course
of which the performer might cook and consume a variety of herbage,
would perhaps give an impulse to the Vegetarian movement, or at least
bring it so palpably before the public that an opinion could be formed
of its advantages or otherwise.

We know an Old Woman (you will find his name in the Peerage)
who, upon ºf solicited to join the present Ministry, humm'd an

enough to say “If you please, Sir, I don't know—but if you will allow
me, Sir, I’ll go and ask Mamma.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI,
A PETRIFIED COMEDY.
Our readers have beheld
certain curiosities of Der-
byshire petrifaction. They
have seen a periwig turned
into the most delicate
stone-work, with every hair
that was, perfect; but still
every hair stone. They
may have seen what was
once a hedgehog with every
prickle a petrified thorn.
Well, we last week, was
- present at the exhibition
of a petrified comedy, called, when alive, the Provoked Husband. Very
curious, indeed, I-that is, for the first five minutes—was it to behold the
process of petrifaction that had entered into every hair, every skin-pore,
of the Provoked Husband once in the flesh, and once so animated. We
believe that if Howe, who appeared as the petrifaction,-the exhibition
took place at the Haymarket—had been gently tapped with the back of
a knife, he would have tinkled.
Lady. Townley, too, was a still more surprising specimen of the pro-
cess. What a fine, gay, dazzling lady she was—as we read—in the time
of DAVID GARRICK, Esq. How her hoop would seem to “cast a girdle
round about the earth,” making subject all it encompassed! And now
has that lustrous ladyship no more life than so much pumice-stone. It
was a burning existence; and now the virtuoso may take and crumble
it between his fingers.
We are assured that these specimens absolutely talked; that they
formed audible words. We have moderately quick ears—especially for
their length—but we did not detect any sounds. We grant that we
saw mouths open and shut, and from them proceed a stream of what
seemed air; but we º: this was only the petrifying process con-
tinued. . As we know that the petrifaction of wigs and lace is . a
º by which the stone in minutest particles is gradually absorbed
y curls and threads, so did we think his lordship was becoming
more petrified as her ladyship opened her mouth at him, and vice versä.
We still believe this to be the fact.
Such, however, was the influence of the Provoked Husband upon
the humblest person accessory to it, that the call-boy—we are tº.
remarkably impressionable lad—was found, when the curtain dropped, a
É. of soft stone from head to heel. in the graphic words of the
ousekeeper to the theatre, “you might have scraped the child like a
Bath brick.” - -
Really, if these things are continued, the police must interfere.
LITTLE LECTURES FOR LORD JOHN.
We beg to offer to LORD JoHN the following subjects for future
lectures:— -
“The Obstacles which retard the progress of an Omnibus from Kew
Bridge to the Bank.
“The Difficulties which lie in the way of a Husband, when he goes
out º. with his Wife.
“The Dangers which, from day to day, beset the progress of a leg of
mutton-hot, cold, and hashed-in a Margate lodging-house.
“The Objections which are sure to be raised, if a married man pro-
to smoke a cigar in the drawing-room. -
“The Moral Impossibilities, which always prevent a man coming
home in rational time, whenever he’s been dining at the Club.
“The Insuperable Obstacles, which invariably retard the removal of
a squalling Baby from his father's bedroom to some other room at
the top of the house, where his cries cannot be heard.”
Small Talk of the Army.
AMoNG the marvels of the Mons: JULLIEN's. Monster. Military
Quadrille is a passage descriptive of a “Dialogue of the Chiefs,” intro-
ducing “solos, duets, and quatuors for four cornets.” We do not exactly
see how “four cornets,” though they may be made to speak by the skill of
the performers, can possibly represent the dialogue of the chiefs of the
army. A cornet is altogether an inferior officer, and it is not likely
that a “general commanding in chief’ would, select the cornet as a
mouth-piece. A movement in A Major would, we think, have been
somewhat more appropriate.
THE CZAR'S IDOL-TRICKS.
OUR contemporaries' advices from St.Petersburg state, that the CzAR
ALEXANDER is making efforts against the Allies, which may, with literal
truth, be described as superhuman. Not only has he ordered a tre-
mendous conscription of his subjects, but he has also pressed into his
service every available Saint in his dominions. Besides the miraculous
image of St. SERGIUs, he took, the other day, to his faithful army, a
picture of the same holy personage, probably no less miraculous, for
which the EMPREss had worked a splendid case in gold and silver
crochet. To one regiment alone he has presented three thousand crosses,
for which also he was indebted to the devotion of his Imperial spouse,
who had brought them from her pilgrimage to the hermi of St.
SERGIUs. That Saint appears to have had the same passion for accur
mulating crosses as some eccentric individuals have for collecting canes
and snuff-boxes. His hermitage was evidently quite a dépôt for those
objects of Russian worship: but the EMPREss must have pretty nearly
cleared off the whole ...
In addition to the above, particulars, we are enabled to state, the
following, which show that ALEXANDER, rather than yield, is resolved
to use up his last Saint and his last Image.
.The EMPEROR has issued an ukase to the Metropolitan Arch:
bishop, commanding him carefully to examine all the holy images, and
see if any of them have had their noses put out of joint by the recent
reverses of the defenders of their divinity; if so, every nose to be duly
mended. The document likewise ordains, that the holy wires, and
springs of all the images that go by miraculous clockwork, shall be
repaired, if out of order: and that every saint that moves shall be regu-
larly wound up. The clergy are also invited to avail themselves of the
powers of galvanism, for the greater glory of the saints; so that by
º º their images may be rendered illustrious and reſulgent
In Une (lark.
His IMPERIAL MAJEsty, in further application of the resources of
modern science in aid of the Orthodox faith, has sent orders to America
for the construction of a ST.VLADIMIR, to act by steam. If St. VLADIMIR
does not answer, the EMPEROR intends to try St. ALEXANDER Newski,
and should St. Airkander deceive his expectations, he will fall back
on ST. SERGIUs.
In that event, however, the idea of a steam Saint will be relinquished
for a notion which is, perhaps, happier. Emboldened by, the example
of his father of pious memory, who marked his cannon-balls (as was
discovered at Alma) with the sign of the Cross, this devout son of a
religious sire has employed Professor JAcoBI, to invent, a submarine
apparatus modelled in the form of ST. SERGIUs, of colossal proportions
for the purpose of blowing up the whole of the Allied Baltic Fleet, and
to be denominated a Celestial Machine.
FRENCH AND ENGLISH KNIGHTHOOD.
THE reasons for making an English Knight are often so utterly
unreasonable that we do not wonder at the “honour” being frequently
declined by those to whom it is offered. They manage these things
better in France, notwithstanding the fact that the Legion of Honour
was getting a little into discredit, by being so indiscriminately aug-
mented that many of the members could boast of no name beyond the
fact that their name was legion. A batch of Knights has, however,
been made very judiciously by the EMPEROR OF THE FREnch, who has
conferred such honour as he is able to bestow, on a number of names
already distinguished by their connection with art and cience."We
look in vain for the Moons and the MUGGERIDGEs in this very satis-
factory list, which somewhat puts to shame the catalogue of our own
very miscellaneous knighthood. Such names as FARADAY, FAIRBAIRN,
STEPHENsoN, and BRUNEL, are names of which we and the French
Legion of Honour may be equally proud; and we cannot help feeling
that even our old electrotyping friend, ELKINGTON, though he receives
his Knighthood as the alleged reward of gilt, has contributed most
º; to the progress of vertu.
Heroic Resolution:
WE read the subjoined in the Sunderland Times:-
“The directors of the Northumberland and Durham District Bank have, we under-
stand, ºrdered all the employés who adorned their faces with a moustache to shave or
resign.'
And—to the honour of Englishmen, we, are * y to record the fact
—the heroic young fellows have returned this defying answer—“We
will not shave; we will dye first l”

has presented to his Holiness sixty pence: or, at least, with the English
equivalent to a Crown.

those “would-be’smart men ; they will sacrifice everything for the sake of appearance.”
WISEACRES AND FOOLS,
. The º: is quoted by the writer of Notes and Sketches
in the Morning Post from some other sage:—
“If the present rage for prostituting literature to the most casual purposes of tem-
porary amusement continues, we shall expect that as we have sliced up our novels
into shilling numbers, and boiled down our BLAckstoxEs and our NiebuhRs into
flabby hebdomadal drivel, we shall in process of time have a comic Prayer-Book and
a Bible in monthly parts, with illustrations by Phiz.”
When shall we hear the last of the Comic Bible and Prayer-book?
The original idea of those two publications was a very nice mild
leasantry, of which the expense had to be defrayed by some unwise
ool, who had stupidly attempted to expose ºf venerable to
ridicule. But why do the platitudinarian censors of literature, keep
circulating this joke in their little sphere, after the manner of MR.
Pope's pigs in the satire?, Well, perhaps, the racy morsel is rather
too strong for their mental digestion. ey do not quite discern that
there is some little difference between themselves and their views on
the one hand, and the Bible and Prayer-book on the other; and, that,
to exhibit the former in a ludicrous point of view, is not exactly the
same thing as to profane the latter.
If, in a wordy and windy essay, you were to tell these gentlemen, for
the millionth time, of the littleness of ambition, the yanity of earthly
glory, and the º, of human affairs, they would gravely assent
to every word you said. But illustrate the littleness, expose the vanity
show the mutability forth in its actual pettiness, and then the ji
exclaim, that the next thing you will do, will be to write a Comic Bible
and Prayer-book. - - -

stinctively hate burlesque. They feel, that they are the bufoon's
natural quarry. , Hence their continual iteration of the idea of a Comic

The fact probably is, that the didactic dunces who sneer at second,
third, fourth, fifth-hand, about Comic Bibles and Prayer-books, are
simply disgusted with the circumstance, that their own platitudes are
not so marketable as other people's zanyisms. They have tales to tell
“full of sound and fury, † º nothing; ” and they are aggrieved
by finding that monthly and weekly serials are preferred ; the public
to their own serious bosh. There is, perhaps, not one of them who
would not give six inches of each of his ears to make a successful pun.

THERE was a LAss of RICHMOND HILL,

That Hill will never, in her place,
See such another Lass.

She dwelleth in a house not much
O'ershadow’d by the trees.
But from her windows since they shut
To some extent the view,
Down are those elm-trees to be cut
In number not a few.
And who are they, to please this Lass,
That mean those trees to fell?
Some Beadles of the better class,
Whose names I need not tell.
The Parish vestrymen select;
The men for tasteless jobs.
And what but such can you expect
From such a set of snobs?
These self-same snobs, some years gone by,
These noble elms did lop,
Rearing their grand heads then so high,
Which crested that hill-top; -
Now at their roots their axe they’ve laid
To gratify the will

THE PAINTER'S MEDAL.
MR, PUNCH has nothing to say here about the jº which has
been displayed in the award of the French, medals to the English
artists. . No doubt SIR EDw1N LANDSEER (whom Mr. Punch abun-
dantly honours and admires, all hereinafter said notwithstanding)
received the great medal, because animal painting is considered in
France to be the grandest department of Art, and his being an old
friend of the EMPEROR's, and a favourite of the EurºRoº's gracious
y, in no way.influenced the selection. It was simply this view of
Art that subordinated the painters of the Light of the World, Jeru-
salem, The Rescue, The Poet's Evening Walk, Don Quirote, and the Last
Sleep, of Argyll, to the painter of PRINCE ALBERT's hat and gloves,
and the Quºn's lovely cockatoo. Let all that pass.
But Mr. Punch must take leave to put it on record, that he humbly
rotests against this calling together the first artists of the day-men who
ave already made their mark, and had their position settled º the
world—to stand in a row, and be judged, comparatively, like schoolboys
in a class: That MASTER THoRBURN is to take up sTER FRITH,
and MASTER Roberts is to take º MASTER HUNT, and MASTER
LANDSEER is to go up to the top, and MASTER GIBsoN is to stand out
of the class altogether: This style of treating eminent men, Mr. Punch
considers utterly unworthy. -
He could quite understand the propriety of the presentation of a
medal to every artist, in eful recognition of his kindness in aiding
to form the wonderful collection just closed. But that a great artist
should receive a medal in token that the verdict of the world is con-
firmed by that of the judges in Paris, and that other great artists
should not receive it, or should be placed in a second, third, fourth, or
fifth class, implies arehearing of claims to reputation, and such rehearing
is ſº intolerable. -
It is well that literary art was out of this affair. It would have been
a worthy sight to have seen our authors sending in their best works,
by invitation. Imagine MACAULAY, HALLAM, ALIson, TENNYson,
RoGERs, BRowNING, DICKENs, THAgrº, LyTTON, CARLYLE,
LANDOR, Punch himself—selecting, their choicest, works and trans.
§ them for judgment. And then imagine the judges deciding
that Mr. Punch was inferior to MR. CARLYLE, or MR. MACAULAY to
MR. ALISON, and that the great gold medal should be §§ to MR.
Jesse (who nevertheless deserves better things than medals), because
he has written Anecdotes of Animals, and has lived—at Windsor:
This part of the French Exhibition business is the only blemish upon
its general, merit; and Mr. Punch mentions, it, §ſeeing with the
EMPEROR himself, that in some cases “Silence is an Error.’

along delay, and a frightful expense, they would geta" reference to the
Master,” as he is called, and in about four years, this gentleman, if, in
good temper aſter a holiday in Switzerland or italy, would give his
report on the facts, and then they could go back to the Court again,
and some day or other a decision would be pronounced. But as MR:
Fondlesquaw did not want to be off, this exercise of professional skill
was not needed. All,"dears, that his attorney, and that attorney’s
conveyancer, MR, DE Kºvn, had to do was to raise as many objections
as possible, in order to make more costs. -
K. very well MR. De KAVIL did it, at the price—his very handsome
fee. The Abstract was sent to him, that he might “advise on the
title,” that is, say whether MRs. SwassDown could show that she had
a right to seiſ the Table. . He sent, back the document to his employer
with the following “opinion” written at the end of it:-
“Subject to the grave question to which I shall presently advert,
an e requisitions here matter made, I thin 18 title may be
d to th t h ft ade. I think this titl b
safely accepted.
“The question is, whether the Work-table belongs to MRs. Swans-
Down at all, or to HER MAJESTY QUEEN VICTORIA
“The officer, whose wife is stated to have given it to MRs. Swans-
powN's ancestress, was a traitor in arms against KING GEORGE THE
Second. Ineed not refer to authorities to show, that British subjects
who fight against the Royal troops are rebels, or that their property
becomes forfeit to the Crown. Unless it can be proved that the officer's
pardon was duly granted, the Work-table ought in strictness to be
sent to Coloneſ. PHIPPs. -
“I think, however, that the Crown might be inclined to relinquish
its rights, and that if it appear that no pardon was issued, a short Act
of Parliament might be procured, next Session (at MRs. Swanspown's
expense), doing away with the treason and confirming the Work-table.
This is commonly done. (See 3 Barn. & Adol., 291; 7 Bosh & Bunkum,
83% and other cases) - . . .
“This Act would complete the title. But if it be shown that the
pardon was duly granted, the Crown is disposed of, and I proceed to
other points of considerable, though unequaſimportance.
clerk was des-If
“On the silver inscription place, the donor is called ‘LETITIA.” In
the letter the signature is “Your ever affectionate and grateful LETTY.”
Evidence must be procured to show the identity of the two names.
The lady's marriage certificate, º: the name “LETITIA,” and any
letters from her husband in which he uses the apparently playful name
‘LETTY,” might throw a light upon this.
“I am not clear that any good consideration was given for the Table
and therefore the gift was void. The letter speaks of ‘shelter and
protection,’ but if we recollect that this was afforded to the KING's
enemy, it will be seen that this is an immoral consideration. The
descendants of the officer might therefore lay claim to the Table, and
if the purchase is to be completed they must be sought out, and §eeds
of renunciation procured from them.
. “These deeds I think the Court of Chancery would compel them. to
sign, because in the letter their ancestress says, “I hope my darling
friend will need no further assurance of our gratitude; but if she does,
and mine will ever testify to it.” This I take to be clearly ‘a
Covenant for Further Assurance.”
“As such a gift is revocable in the life-time of the giver, evidence
must be procured that the lady is deceased, if such be the case. I assume
that if she is now, alive, she is about 130 or 140 years of age, and would
º join in the present arrangement. The husband seems to have
!een some years older, and would therefore be about 150. Is he still
living, and will he join?
“Some time in the reign of GEORGE THE SEcond, there were four
small knobs at the corners of the Table. One of these is gone. When
was it alienated, and by what authority?
“As the letter was written before the Stamp Act was passed, I
think that, the Post-office mark may be held sufficient stamp, but
unfortunately the date hereon is obliterated, and the defect is not
cured by the writer, who dates “lst January, 46.” This might be 1546,
1646, or 1846 for anything we know. You must ask for evidence on
this point. There is no water-mark in the paper, and if there were, the
fraudulent practices of paper-makers, in using untruthful dates, deprive
such testimony of value.
“The same document says. For your dear husband's trouble in
#. this to you, make him the prettiest of courtesies, and give him
the sweetest of,’ &c. As this may be held to constitute him Tenant by
the Courtesy, we must have proof of his demise.
“MRs. SwansDown being an only child, her inheriting the Table
from her mother was in due course. But her mother was one of
seventeen children of the original donee, and we must have evidence
as to the reason why she was selected to possess it, and also that the
other sixteen acquiesced. From an expression in a note of one of
these, on page 91, that ‘..MADGE, as yow'sual gits hawl mother as to
give,” the writer evinces discontent, and her descendants may even now
set up a claim. It will be safest that the representatives of the sixteen
children should all join-on the average of increase and deaths there
will not be more than a hundred and ninety persons to be sought out
and satisfied.
“The donor says ‘Such of my family as survive have come over here
much discontented.” These must be held as Cross Remainders Oyer,
but as the abrupt termination of the sentence amounts to Discontinu.
ance, the regular searches must be made in the Register Office of
Middlesex, the Scotch Nonconformist's º: the Moribund College
of Madagascar, the Harleian Miscellany, and the Index Expurgatorius,
especially as the donor's husband was a Catholic. -

whether we are not proceeding regularly.
Clothed with Authority.
We find from the Civil Service Gazette, that the Clerks in the Custom
House at Hull have adopted, of their own accord, a meat uniform.
Of course, if these gentlemen like to go into livery, there can be no
objection to such a proceeding; but we do not quite concur with our
contemporary in recommending the Civil Service generally to adopt a
similar plan. The only uniform we are prepared to recommend to the
adoption of the Government Clerks is uniform politeness, of which
some of them are very much in need.

ED SMOKER,
HAve SoMewHERE to SMoke | *
the blessed Pope on that sacred and ever memorable festival
of St. Guy Fawkes, FRANcis-Joseph generously resigned
to for Frus ºne Ninth the virtual sovereignty of the
Austrian dominions. This was no lip-service; no hypo-
critical kissing of the cross embroidered on what heretics
may denominate the ScARLET LADY's white satin slippers.
No: the act of pious humility consisted in the bond fide
surrender of the supreme Imperial authority to the sovereign
PontLFF.
At the time when fireworks were fizzing and bonfires
were blazing in abjuration and contempt of the Pope's
authority and jurisdiction in these dominions, the EMPEROR
of AUSTRIA solemnly ratified the establishment of the Pope's
Church in Austria with all its rights and privileges. Among
these rights and privileges are expressly enumerated the cen-
sorship of the press, and the right, to have heretics pun-
ished. The EMPERoR engages to be subservient to their
enforcement; and with a modesty unparalleled, in the
world's history, his Majesty has nearly limited his own
functions to that subserviency.
The Bishops are to superintend the education of youth in
all public and private schools, with the power to forbid any
teaching in any study which they may consider contrary to
that of the Papal Church—the º expressly invested
with the right to pronounce on that subject. Where would
the permicious teaching of GALILeo and NEwton be now
if that authority had universally and always been enjoyed
by the Roman prelates which was formally conceded to
}.} by FRANCIS-Joseph of Austria, on last GUY FAwkEs’
ay
The EMPEROR resigns to the Pope all control over the
national church: the Bishops are to have complete autho-
rity over the Clergy, subject only to the Pope: his Holiness
complete and irresponsible authority over the Bishops.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
That is the way to show a sincere belief in the vicarious deity of the
Pope. That we might now have had a QUEEN MARY THE Second
doing, if Guy Fawkes had been as successful in 1604 as CARDINAL
WIAir PRELA was on the Fifth of November, 1855.
Was not the agitation into which this country was thrown by the
so-called Papal aggression five years ago as ridiculous as the profoun
CoBDEN and the judicious BRIGHT maintain it to have been? Was not
the outcry against the paternal attempt of the Pope to establish an
imperium in imperio here, a senseless clamour: a vulgar howl, “offensive
to the feelings of our Catholic fellow-subjects?” But oh! who are
our Catholic fellow-subjects?. The sovereignty of the Sovereign Pontiff
is not yet established in this realm. QUEEN Victoria is still the
Sovereign thereof; not Pius THE NINTH: she has not yielded up her
authority to him as the EMPEROR of Austria did his on the last
anniversary of Guy Fawkes.
Ah! It was a great mercy—the preservation of the EMPEROR of
Austria's life from the assassin's dagger. But as the stroke, did not
prove fatal—may there not be some reason why believers in the Pope
should believe it to have been a º blow? The blow took effect on
the occiput-effect extending to the brain: the proximate effect, we
think, of stunning at the time... Do we not see the increasing effect of
that blow on the head, in the illustrious sufferer's º surrender of
his own dignity and of theiberties of his subjects to the Pope P
THEY MANAGE THESE THINGS BETTER IN
FRANCE,
MAGNA Charta’s a wonderful charter;
Habeas Corpus a glorious thing:
For our great Bill of Rights, as a martyr
Mr. Punch would be happy to swing.
For King, Lords, and Commons, as stoppers
On each other, a long life he craves;
Britannia he loves on our coppers,
And trusts she may long rule the waves.
But while sure that John Bull, of his neighbours
urope, is far in advance;
There are things, which, spite of John's labours,
Somehow seem better managed in France.
John BULL offers incense to BUMBLE,
Till his vestries are turn’d into mobs;
Till his town-legislation’s a jumble,
s. Fruitful only in rates, jars, and jobs.
Not a nuisance John hints at removing,
But the vested rights sound their alarms;
Not a fever-nest Johns' for improving,
But Bumbledom's straight up in arms.
If John wouldn’t think it to absurd to
Condescend towards Paris a glance;
own Improvement’s one thing Ireferr'd to,
Which they manage much better in France.
Foreign Railways excite John's derision,
Check’d and cow'd by the Government's power;
John enjoys unrestrain’d competition,
Spins along sixty miles in the hour:
Till with pace, as with loans and debentures,
He finds he’s been rather too rash,
And both travellers' and shareholders’ ventures
Too often result in a smash. -
If aught beyond JoHN Bull's own pale weighs
With Joãs, Punch would break on his trance,
With a hint that join's pet hobby—Railways–
been managed much better in France.
John boasts of his comforts—of taking
at John, calls “his ease in his inn”—
Through the day in hot coffee-room baking,,, .
Through the night with hot feathers tuck'd in...
“Chops and steaks,” “steaks and chops,” for his eating,
British Port and Cape Sherry to swill—
Then comes taxing the bill, and brow-beating
The harpies “not charged in the bill.”
Mr. Punch doesn't wish by comparison
John's trav’lling regrets to enhance; .
But your London hotel'gainst your Paris one—
They manage things better in France.
John BULI's every town is a centre
Of inventions most useful to man;
But, alas! for John's greatest inventor,
Unless he can patent his planſ
John's titles, and ribands, and garters
Are for rank, or for wealth, or for war,
His º ones of science are martyrs,
Who have still worm the cross, not the star-
At John's court art and science are zeroes,
Or if counted, 'tis favour or chance;
As for homage to peace and its heroes,
They manage things better in France.
John flatters himself never nation
Than his has more practical been—
It was hoped in his war-preparation
This practical power would be seen.
Yet his army to death's door, last winter,
Within six miles of plenty, was brought;
And what Russ shot, shell, sabre, and splinter
Could not do, John’s own hand all but wrought
Yes—though John, like the Doges, in marriage
Has taken great Ocean's expanse,
Let him own, after last year's miscarriage,
They manage things better in France.
John’s instincts, however civilian,
Tell him tools for their work should be made;
For John's army last year, thirty million
e old boy un udgingly paid.
It has chiefs, to whom dotage is no bar-
A staff, still at school in its work—
Rank and file, whose advance, drunk or sober,
Pride of wealth and of birth join to burke.
From his fool's dream if John would awaken,
Let him look over sea—not askance—
And he’ll find, unless Punch be mistaken,
That they manage things better in France.
A NICE MAN FOR A SMALL (PEACE) PARTY.
ExETER, a lecturer named FRY, whom,
from his want of influence, we may
be excused for calling Small Fry,
has been, it seems, recommending the
formation...of a regiment of News-
Wº: Editors, to take part in the
ar, whose prosecution they so vigor-
ously insist upon. This proposition
sounds well enough; but if everybody
were to leave his own business to go and
do somebody else's business, the neglect
which is the usual fate of what is cºiled
“everybody's business,” would soon be
realised. The same principle recom-
mended in one instance would apply to
all others; and, if everybody was liable
to be, what our friend FRY would call, “taken at his word,” it would
be impossible to advocate the doing of anything, without º: pre-
pared to go and do it oneself at the first bidding. We do not know,
what may be the ordinary occupation of this particular FRY; or
whether he lectures because he has nothing better to do, which would
be equivalent to his having nothing to do of any description whatever;
but we are quite sure, if he were to want his dinner cooked, or his cont
mended, or his shirt washed, or his boots patched, or any other domestic
operation performed, he would think it . hard to be told to go and
do it himself, because he happened to say, he thought it ought to be
done effectually. We shall now quit the subject, and apologise to our
readers for having occupied so much time over the subject; for the
largest Fry is never worth roasting.

our mistake, and indeed it is obvious that the Magazines which are

neither the fire of genius, nor a spark of talent about them.

REFORM YOUR REFORMATORIES.
PHILANTHRoPIsTs are asking in all directions, “What is to be done
with juvenile delinquency P. Common sense. would reply, that it is
better to prevent juveniles from becoming delinquent than to wait for
the development of childish innocence into infantine roguery, before it
is considered ripe for the action of the philanthropist. Reformatory
schools are all very well, but formatory schools would be much better;
for the first have to undo as well as do, while the second would only have
the latter and comparatively easier work to execute. Unhappily, the
philanthropists generally decline to deal with juveniles in a wholesome
state; but, like moral epicures, they wish humanity to have a “gamey”
flavour, and in fact to have become “high” and rather corrupt, before
they will have anything to do with it. We have known instances in
which juvenile humanity has been rejected as unfit for P.
food, on the ground that it has not been kept sufficiently long in that
larder of iniquity, the gaol; that “safe” for what may be termed our
criminal provender.
The moralists who will not interfere to prevent a disease, but are
active in trying to effect a cure, are like those doctors of more than
doubtful honesty, who stand by and see apatient falling into a sickness
which might perhaps be kept off, except for the wish of the medical man
to obtain the credit-and the profit-of restoring an invalid to salubrity.
The old maxim, that “Prevention is better than cure” is not only the
best, but it is the only sound principle to act upon with reference to
that part of the juvenile population from which the ranks of crime are
now recruited. Philanthropists may talk by the hour, and print
pamphlets by the pound, but a nut-shell—a walnut-shell at all events—
will contain the whole gist of the question. Compulsory education, and
F. responsibility duly enforced, will cure the monster evil. Ter-

AN OPERATIC BLOW-OUT.
It seems, from sundry advertisements, that there is an Italian Opera
progressing, we hope successfully, at the foyal Soho Theatre. This little
dramatic snuggery has often been compared to a Band-box; and the
ager seems resolved that the capacity of the Band-boxshall be tested
by the introduction of a Band, on a scale of some pretensions: for we per-
ceive that an engagement has been entered into with Mons. PRosPERE
whose name will reach the portals of posterity (not on the Trumpet of
Fame), but through the tubes of a monster ophicleide. We confess we
are rather startled by the announcement in question; for, if all the
arrangements, are upon the same, tremendous, scale; if Prospers,
on the monster ophicleide is to be seconded by BottesiNI on the
gigantic double-bass; and CHIPP on the very grossest of gross cases; the
effect in the limited salle of the Lilliputian Soho in Dean Street will be
literally stunning. We admire boldness in every undertaking; and we
must admit that the attempt to perform Grand Opera, in a space a
very few yards square, is entitled to every encouragement. It is all
very well to snub the affair, and talk about a storm in a tea-cup; but we
must remember that the storm is always respectable, i. the tea
cup may be insignificant. We therefore wish every success to th–
stupendous speculation in the Soho snuggery; and we hope that the
engagement of Mons. PROSPERE may be the source of much prosperitye

HOW TO GET AN ADVERTISEMENT.
BERE are several meat
and successful ways in
which you may obtain
an advertisement with-
Out jº for it. One
good plan is to watch
the legitimate corre-
spondence of a leading
journal, and when any.
wise or benevolent pro.
position, immediately
to tack yourself and
}. shop on to it.
or instance, if a lady
offers to send linen to
the Crimea, write to
the Times next day,
and say that you deeply
admire her benevo-
lence, and shall be
happy to mark all the
shirts with your Iudeli-
ble ...; Ink, the
properties o which are
so, &c., &c., that the
marks will defy wea-
ther, washing, and dis-

takes to forward books
to the soldiers, write to the Editor, and offer to have *. tied up with your Incorrodible
and Unsnappable Cord, whose durability, &c., &c., prevent any chance of loss. These
courses º naturally suggest themselves to the tradesmanlike mind;—and the great point is
not to forget to add your name and address in full. A letter in the Times, which that
journal good-naturedly inserts for nothing, is read by everybody, and is better than fifty
pounds' worth of º advertisements. - - -
Another good plan Mr. Punch would notice, as it may be useful to literary men and
publishers, of a certain grade, to know it. You are the proprietor of some obscure paper,
which at its price j be cheap, if it were good for anything. You engage ANYBody to
write a story therein, and he, with a wise forethought and concern for your interests, gives
his story the same name as that borne by the work of SoMEBODY., Let us suppose. that he
takes Night and Morning, or the Cricket on the Hearth. The rubbish proceeds to its close
without attracting any particular notice, and then ANYBody begins a new story...This you
advertise, perhaps, as My Eye and my Elbow, by the Author of Wight and Morning. The SoME-
ody has put forth a |&
honest nurses. Or, if
Body who wrote the latter story puts four lines
into the paper, disclaiming connection with My
Bye and my Elbow. . Now is your chance—you,
or your ANYBODY—for you, must send this letter
to the Times.
“SIR,--I am very sorry that SIR. B. L., BART.
(or MR. D., or as the case may §. have
thought it necessary to disavow the authorship
of anything in my paper, the Penny Buffer, a
paper which whether from its &c., its &c., or its
&c., may boldly challenge competition with any
paper in the world, and whose circulation is
C., &c.
*A most masterly and noble story, which has
attracted the attention of everybody, did appear
in the Penny Buffer, under the title of Night
and Morning. I was not aware that SIR. B. L.
had written anything under the same title. But
the selection of it by the author of My Eye and
my Elbow was his own doing, not mine.
“I can only say, that the author of Wight and
Morning and My Eye and my Elbow is a most
admirable and popular writer, who is already
favourably known by those splendid fictions,
the Haughty Peer and Honest Pauper, the
Daughter of the Workhouse, the Gory Locks, the
Spectre Sausage, the Mysteries of Billingsgate,
the Dagger of Blood, the Skeleton in the %;
and many other first-rate works, all of which may
be procured, at my publishing office, in penny
numbers, and each with a coloured frontis-
pleCe.
“Hoping this "explanation” will be satisfactory,
“I am, Sir, Your obedient servant,
“TIMOTHY CLUTCII.
(Publisher of the Penny Buffer.)”
“13 and 14, Plugghole Street.”
Now, you know, if you send that to the News-
paper, with a few lines about the Editor's “sense
of justice,” and the “injury an uncontradicted
paragraph, may do a person in business,” you
will get that royal puff into enormous notice
and circulation. You might send Mr. Punch
i. handsome for giving you the hint,
though the idea is not his own. But all is fair
in trade.
THE NEW ALIEN BILL.
We have the authority of the Morning’Tizer for the alarming fact,
that at this very hour a new Alien Bill is in course of preparation, if
not already prepared; in obedience to the wishes of a certain foreign
potentate. Are we to be surprised, if the 'Tizer should i.e. ask
the country, if this is a time when Englishmen should sit quietly by
their fireside, seeing that through the fireside of the foreigner, a
tyrannical minister may have a poke at their own bars P. We cannot
and we will not be surprised if, in the most candid, tone of patriotism,
the ’Tizer calls º true Britons to be up and doing! -
We are requested not to name the undoubted authority, to which we
owe a few of the disclosures as to the clauses in the new Bill; a Bill
that, if suffered to pass will, of course, make England a mere appanage
of France. The boot of the tyrant has already, marked its heel in
Jersey—another step takes. Guernsey; a hop another step brings
him triumphant at every Englishman’s fireside. And this, we doubt
not, is what the Morning 'Tizer must, socner or º, sonorously pre-
dict. However, we give a few of the atrocities of the contemplated

FURTHER DECLINE OF THE DRAMA.
We had hoped better things for the ºf. Drama at Drury Lane
than the doings promised, or we should rather say threatened, in the
following advertisement:—
“On Monday next, Nov. 26, will appear (for the first time in Europe) MADAMs
LABARBRE º a Troupe of flions, Lionesses, Tigers, Bears, Dogs, &c. (in a cage)”.
After going through various performances, they will sit down to dinner with MADAMIf
LABARARE and feed from her mouth. The Dog will feed the Lionesses, &c. Besides
oing through the usual performances of putting her head in the Lion's mouth, &c.,
ADAME LABARRBE will fire a pistol, at which the animals will all crouch at her feet.
These wonderful animals have created the greatest surprise and enthusiastic appro-
bation wherever they have been seen.”
We should have thought MR. C. MATTHEws and his Twenty Minutes
with a Tiger would have rendered quite unnecessary the introduction
of MADAME LABARBRE and the brutal guests with whom she sits down
to dinner. The age for exhibitions of this kind had, we flattered our-
selves, been brought to a close, with the days when people wished to
see the unfortunate enthusiast, who insisted on descending like a
cannon-ball from a balloon, in a basket attached to an umbria, which
he hoped would break his fall; and, when the enlightened British
Fº who had flocked to see a man hang himself by the neck at Vaux-
all, applauded him for ten minutes after he had
their being aware of the fatal termination of the disgusting exhibition.
It is true we have had men suspended by the heel to balloons in the
air; but, as we have lately seen an account of the insolvency of one of
these flighty gentlemen, we came to the conclusion, that the profession
yf throwing oneself out of a car, at an altitude of some thousand
feet in the air, was not adapted to the present taste of the public. We
regret, therefore, the apparently retrograde step that has been taken by
the Managers of Drury Lane, in inviting the public to a feast so far
removed from a feast of reason, as to include beasts for its guests,
while the hostess rams her head down the throat of the Lion, her
principal visitor.

“HEAVEN BLESS THE DUKE OF ARGYLE!”
IT seems the DUKE OF ARGYLE is to be the Postmaster-General.
is is the first time that in England the name of ARGYLE has been
brought in close connection with the Post, though in Scotland, we
believe, some such institution has long flourished under the ducai
auspices, having for generations past been most efficacious in bringing
all hands up to the scratch. Let us hope one of the Fº: effects of the
Duke's appointment will be, to cure the postmen of the terrible itch
they have for opening our letters. In our opinion, the most effectual
cure, and the one that would produce the least irritation, would be to
increase their miserable salaries, which at present are scarcely sufficient
with the tremendous amount of walking they have, to keep body and
soul together, of their boots, much less their persons. Let the new
Postmaster-General do this, and many a poor, fagged, worn-out fellow
will fervently exclaim, as he rushes to the Post, “ Heaven Bless the
DUKE OF ARGYLE!”

“TO BE, OR NOT TO BE.”—(A BARONET*)

MAYOR, would be re-created, that is, would be made a baronet, it was
also made known to all Aldermen who had still to pass the chair, that
such an incident was not to be misinterpreted into a precedent. The
line was to be drawn at Moon.
We earnestly trust that this determination will be re-considered. The

#. of the King of Wurtemberg's carriage, was about to, order
the triple salute; on which the officer in command cried out—“Silenceſ
it’s only a King?”
Therefore, should the precedent we have alluded to be rigorously
held, the LoRD MAYOR, denied his baronetcy, must console himself
with the thought that his royal guest was “only a king”. Perhaps,
however, his lordship is open to a composition. Will he take a

belonged to the Russian service. Their names *::::::::: were John
Bright, Richard Cobden, and William Gladstone. hen brought into
§ they were severeſ examined, and plenty of evidence secured in
the shape of speeches, &c., to prove their close relationship with the
Court of St. Petersburg. The tendency of all these documents mani-
fested but too clearly a strong, antipathy to the policy of England,
whilst, at the same time, they advocated the warmest interest in favour
of the tactics pursued by the barbarian Colossus of the North. Other
proofs established beyond a doubt their Russian origin and sympathies,
and accordingly they have all been condemned as Russian Prizes. It
is not expected, however, that they will fetch much, as not one of the
craft has anything of value on board.
A Hint for Jullien.
THE great maestro has given us, with all the Fº emotions of the
subject most musically rendered, The Sebastopol Waltz: why, does he
not, as a moral warning, produce. The Gent's Galopf. It might begin
with a silver opening indicative of the spoon stirring the gin-and-water,

“Fragile!”
THE Public Hall of Taunton, lately devoted to the meetings of the

glass can be more brittle than the “weaker vessels;” that his mugs
can be more cracked than the elders.

A CLERGYMAN, nearly 20 years in orders, is close upon starvation
or the workhouse. £20 would save him; will no one offer it? MS. sermons of his
own for sale; one lent for a stamp.–Rev. J. R. H., Post-office, Brighton.
This must be a case of imposition. Is it likely that the Bishop or
FLEshpots, for instance, would be deaf to such a cry? No; he has no
doubt sought out “J. R. H.,” has weighed him, and found him want-
ing. Again, the loan of a sermon for a penny is suspicious. Sermons

The RR is aſº want, it seems, of Reformatory Institutions for
Juvenile Offenders. Perhaps this want might be advantageously sup-
plied by a slight improvement of existing institutions for the correction
of old rogues; namely, those marine varieties of “quod” which are
commonly called hulks. The hulk in its earlier stage would perhaps
supply a convenient asylum for delinquents of early years. In a word,
why cannot untaught urchins be sent to a boarding-school on board a
man-of-war, and there trained up to be honest tars, instead of thieves
and vagabonds?

THE FLOWERS OF THE TEMPLE :
THE Templars have been again radiant and vigorous in their show of
chrysanthemums in the Temple Garden. These floral glories have
become a delightful fact; and very humanising, very pleasing in its
influence. The coal-bargemen of the Thames pause on the oar to con-
tºpº the flowers of law, and the Captain of the Bride, cries “Ease
her!” that he may drop gently by the Garden, bright and gaudy with
the floral triumph. However, it must not be supposed that this annual
chrysanthemum show meets with favour from all the benchers: by no
means; there are among them men who, with a due reverence for the
severity of law, have n known to express an opinion, that the
annual display of flowers is only an exhibition of great legal weakness.
Think of the awful THURLoe with a rose-bud in his button-hole !
Imagine the great LoRD ELpon (and that, too, in the Court of
Cº.) having .# to do with heart’s-ease !
Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the Temple chrysanthemums
carry away the prize of admiration at least from all other chrysanthe-
mums SOever. e resolved to take the trouble of practically inquiring
into the cause of this. We therefore put on an over-coat with two
very large pockets—and (what will not Mr. Punch do in the cause of
truth and science and the readers of his journal price 3d. P) making our
way to the Temple Gardens, we, from time to time, looking closely
into the retiring merits of some individual flower-(they are all chris.
tened)—some " Blackstone splendens,” some “Coke simpler,” some
“Eldon dubitans,” some “Talford benevolens,” some “Bacon dupler,”
—furtively filled both pockets with the garden mould, in order to
analyse its component parts. As usual, we found that all the success
was a question of soil. The chrysanthemums were magnificent because
of the excellence of the loam and compost in which they were planted.
On a careful analysation, Mr. Punch found the soil to contain one
part of horse-hair; three of parchment; one of silk and two of stuff.
As rags are necessary for the cultivation of hops, so it appears are
legal silk and stuff most beneficial to the chrysanthemum. To these
there were four parts of scrapings from the scrapers of the lnns of Court;
and thirteen parts of fine bone-dust—making, no doubt, a beautifu
“top-dressing”—ground from departed suitors in the Court of
Chancery. ow, then, can we wonder at the magnificence of the
Templars’ chrysanthemums, looking at the cost of the soil that
nourishes and developes them?
“THE HOUSE OF ELMORE.”
..We see a Book advertised under the above title. As we are not
visitors of the ELMoREs, we are anxious to know what kind of a House
they have. Is it a private, or a public House? Is it a House in the City,
or a Greek House, or a Manchester House? Is it a House in the
hardware, or the dry, or the soft goods line P or does it deal in coals,
pickles, periodicals, greengrocery, baby jumpers or perambulators? Is
it a safe House, or a cheap and dirty House? it respectable, or
merely a shabby-genteel House that gives dismal evening parties, where
you can get nothing but Marsala and ham-sandwiches? As yet, we
only know that the House is to be Sold in Three Wols, and as we have
no particular affection for the name of ELMoRE, and know nothing
about his House, excepting that the valuation modestly put upon it is
£l lls. 6d., we are not very likely to become tenants or visitors of his.
The agents for selling the House (whether, it consists merely of one
story, or several stories, we are not told) are MEssRs. HURST AND
BLACKETT; but we believe any one can become a day-tenant upon the
ayment of a penny a volume to any circulating library. Upon those
erms, we may look in upon ELMöRE some foggy afternoon, and run
through his House.
Decision in Irish Lunacy.
In the Court of Queen's Bench, Dublin, JUDGE CRAMPTON, with
the concurrence of JUDGEs PERRIN' and MooRE, ruled, in the case of
BEAMISH wersus BEAMISH, that a Clergyman might .

TORY TREATY AND TRAITORS.
. OUR odd friends the "Conservative Statesmen,” (who are not busily
intriguing in concert with Messes. GLApstone AND BRIGHT, O dear
no!), are º: in their 3. now. They want to
upset LoRD PALMERSTON at any price, and high prices and consequent
privations appear to these patriots a capital leverage. So, they are
promulgating a rumour, that the EMPEROR or Russia offered terms
ºf peace, that the EMPEROR OF THE FREngh has approved them, and
that Loan PALMRAston rejects them, in order to prolong the War for
the sake of prolonging his own popularity as a vigorous War-Minister.

EMPERQR of Russia has privately signified to MR. DisBAELI, that he
should like to make peace upon certain terms, and these be they:-
1. That the Allies should withdraw from Russia.
8. That they should formally, restore all they have taken, thereby
confirming the Russian title to it, for the future.
3. º: they should pay Russia for whatever damage they have
Caused her.
4. That a treaty should place everything as it stood before the War.
5. That Russia should promise to give pe no further cause for

Ministry should include Lond ESBURY, as a “material guarantee”

that if they took office, the spirit, if not the very letter, of such terms

EAT NO SUGAR
It being an understood thing, that the high price of sugar was
caused by three or four avaricious speculators, who went into the
sugar-market and bought all they could find, we hope these *::::
mercenaries who were so anxious to sack the saccharine, will be allow
to keep full possession of their bargain. , Let everybody abstain from
sugar as much as he can, so that those who rapaciously forestalled the
sweets, may now have some of the bitters. , Let the holders of su
find that the article, which was supposed to be “a very nice thing,” has
become a drug in the market. Let.infancy be taught to abstain from
the tempting lollipop; let old maids practise patriotism over their
cups—we mean of course their tea-cups—by drinking their favourite
beverage without sugar. Already the sugar abstinence inovement is
taking effect, and the sordid speculators are obliged to submit to a
reduction of their unhallowed profits. Let those who can't afford white,
refuse to adopt brown, and thus set the principle of “snowing brown
when you can't snow white” at defiance. Bread is a necessary, but
sugar is not; so let all who wish to give a lesson to avarice, renounce
sweet-stuff of every kind, eschew pastry of all sorts, and allow all the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
º
AN EXCOMMUNICATED KING IN FRANCE.
THE KING of SARDINIA suffers the blight of the Pope's excommuni-
cation. His Holiness has breathed the red plague upon that forlorn
creature, Victor EMMANUEL. Wheresoever his Majesty walks or sits,
there walks or sits in shadow, the Evil One lacqueying him unto the
end—and such an end l. WrºtoR EMMANUEL has laid his profane hand
upon the monasteries of Piedmont, having no more mercy of the pious
things that harboured there than vigorous, housewives in summer-time
have of the winter tenants of their bedsteads. In his ruthless extermina-
tion, VICTOR EMMANUEL would not have spared even the chosen flea of
ST. Francis; the saint, as it is well known tº all pious students of his
affecting life, in his humility, claiming brotherhood with the smallest
things that hop or crawl. Nevertheless, so hard had the heart of
VICTOR ANUEL become, that even the sacred garment of a St.
FRANCIS would have failed in the sacredness of its asylum to the things
that are commonly harboured and comforted in a monk’s gown. For
the evil of excommunication was and is upon VICTOR EMMANUEL; and
like the KING of IsrAEL, he had become foolish under the visitation—
foolish and frantic. He knew not what he did; but that was no reason
he should not be all the more scourged for his ignorance.
Well, Victor resolves to visit heretical England—the only º:
fitted for him, on his downward way, thinks His Holiness the Pope.
He must, however, pass through France; pious France; France with a
fresh fragrance, as of lilies and violets upon her from the fresh oaths
of bishops; newly-sworn to new fidelity to their Catholic Master, the true
son and servant of the Pope, NAPOLEoN THE THIRD of Iron Presence.
VICTOR is an excommunicated man. All that approaches him is
cursed by the ..ºf breath of the Church! Fire only can º
whatever has touched him. . He stands, alone, made solitary by the
perdition that is hung around him. Let him die to-morrow, and—with
the Pope's holy will working—VICTOR EMMANUEL must even cumber
the earth; for no consecrated dust may cover him. Nevertheless
this curse-crowned King—this King robed with the maledictions of
the Pops—comes to France, and French Cardinals and Bishops, with
the wisdom of serpents and the innocence of doves, forget the moral
sores of the tainted backslider. Though a LAZARUs of Šín, he is to France
fresh as the Shepherd, DAVID, Is not this beautiful? Does not the
Christian heart melt like ambergris at the thought of this charity,
stirring and active-(there can be no doubt, of the fact, for is it not
written in the Moniteurſ)—and yearning with affectionate forgetfulness
towards the chosen, the honoured guest of the Most Catholic and no
less Most Resolute NAPOLEoN THE THIRD ! These good Churchmen
behold not the excommunicated of the Pops; they only look upon the
King whom the EMPEROR delights to honour.
Therefore is it, that the wise Imperial heart resolves to do a speeial
grace to these honey-hearted sons of the Church; and therefore NAPO-
LEQN THE RESOLUTE determines to receive anew their plighted oaths
to him and his state, even in the presence of Victor EMMANUEL the
Rxcommunicate. But the Cardinals and the Bishops behold not the
leper of Rome. . No: they smile upon a hirsute Christian; one with
hair that might have honoured SAMsgn ere he laid his head in the lap
of DELILAH Heresy. And Cardinals and Bishops swear again; take
another oath, with a new relish, even as though the new oath of fidelity

Ips at lt.
More than this. So wholly had the thoughts of the direful condition
of WigtoR EMMANUEL passed from the ecclesiastical mind, that the
Pope's Nuncio-yea, the Nuncio of the Pope ; of that PóPE whose
destroying breath had passed over the sacrilegious Victor, making,
from head to heel, blotches of his whole body—the Pope's Nuncio
with a face bright as the face of any painted Saint in any cathedral
window; -introduced to that right royal, hirsute and debonnaire sove-
reign, all the ambassadors of all the kings; even as it is ever the blithe
duty of the Pope's Nuncio to do. Yea, even the ambassador, the
chosen one of FRANCIS-Joseph, the chosen one of Pio Nono, by the
servant of the Pope was brought face to face with the excommunicated
Sardinian; and, Nuncio, and Ambassador, and Potentate Excommu-
nicate all smiled º
And so healing is the will of NAPOLEON THE REsolute that, albeit

TOLERATION FOR THE BIBLE-BURNERS.
IN a Natural History of Enthusiasm might be described a tribe of
fanatics, -Class, Popish; Order Monastic.....It appears that some
maniacs of this species have been burning Bibles at Kingstown, in
Ireland; and we are sorry to find, that certain monks, accused of that
rofanation, are in course of being prosecuted for it, Prosecute such
#. for committing an act calculated to provoke a breach of the
eace, if you like—but not for the theological crime of burning Bibles.
he Bible, surely, will vindicate itself. ye them to burn the Bible
if they please, and their own fingers. Let them burn the Bible; and
do you get it read; their use of the book will second yours.
A sincere Protestant would think it a very impious act to burn the
Douay, or Roman Catholic version of the Scriptures... He believes it
to contain mistranslations—which is all the Papists allege against the
authorised translation. Nay, more, he believes it to contain interpo-
lations, additions, and ridiculous fables. But he knows that the re-
mainder of it consists of genuine text, and he would shudder at the
idea of burning that with the rest of it... That Papists should exhibit
themselves as burning Truth, because of its presumed admixture with
a little error, is an advantage to Protestantism.
The “Redemptorist, Fathers,” as they, call themselves, are the
parties charged with Bible-burning. It is but fair to say, that one of
them, a MR. DE BUGGENOMs—this ridiculous name is no coinage of
ours, reader—denies, the impeachment—so does, FATHER MEvoy:
but whilst contradicting the fact, he justifies the thing. He would do
it himself, he says, with the help of a pair of tongs to seize the Bible.
These “Redemptorists” are said to have burnt the Bible, together
with some immoral works. If this is so, it is a very strong argument
against prosecuting them. Burning the Bible in the company of bad
books is such a very edifying imitation of a certain deed done by the
Jewish Priests imperante Tiberio, when TIBERIUs was Emperor of
Rome—and Pontius PILATE procurator of Judea.
Don’t prosecute them. Give them º: enough, and leave them to
unish themselves., Let them burn a pile of Bibles, if they dare; only
É. thankful that they cannot have a Protestant in, the centre of it
chained to a stake... Be content, in the meanwhile, to burn, Guy

fellow-subjects,” is nevertheless no insult to, Christianity. Allow the
friars to fry what they like-taking only good care that they shall not
fry us.

not altogether harmless, but that it aims at the

THE AUSTRIAN EXHIBITION FOR 1859.
THE EMPEROR FRANCIs-Joseph has resolved, that there shall be an
Austrian Exhibition in 1859. The EMPEROR is right to name so ºf
a day. After the astounding exhibition, he has just made of himself,
the world can afford to wait. What do we say,+the world? The
world is to have nothing to do with the show. The world is desired to
keep its distance. The Exhibition is to comprise only the products
and manufactures of Austria, Hungary, and her Italian, Slavº-States.
This is quite right; otherwise Mr. Punch had, at the first blush of the
thing, resolved to take a certain space for the exhibition of his own
volumes—books from which the thoughtful, Austrian, might, haply,
have learned a still finer *. of the abounding beauties of the
Austrian Constitution as therein pictorially, and at times poetically,
illustrated. As, however, Mr. Punch is not to be permitted to exhibit
the marvels of his own genius, he will nevertheless, not refuse the
service of his advice as to certain of the articles to be shown to an
instructed generation—articles of Austrian, and Austro-Italian produce
and manufacture. We give a few : namely-
Specimen of the stone of the Spielberg, in which ſhe wicked SIIyio

Specimens of the paper of Austria in the letter written by Count
BETHLEN, in which he narrates how Count LEININGEN in his dungeon
ropheti warned HAYNAU “not to venture on a visit to England,
or the people would stone him.”
Specimens of the precious gems of Austria, comprising among others
the bracelet of rubies worn by the ARCH-Duchess Sophia (mother of
“Austria's hope”) on the anniversary of Arad. The rubies set in so
many roses as were the number of heads of the Hungarians who fell
there; "a bracelet she delights to wear!”

ABUSE OF BRITISH HOSPITALITY.
CAN it be endured that the organ of a set of Aliens should presume
to hold the following language concerning HER MAJESTY's illustrious
ally, VICTOR EMMANUELP
“With all loyalty towards our Gracious Soverrior, be it permitted us to say, that if
our Sardinian ally could be well and effectually humbled without extending the horrors
of war over Western Europe, and without inflicting misery and bloodshed on his
innocent subjects, few things would be more pleasing, as few things would be more
richly deserved.”
Ah! there is no doubt that we must have an Alien Act passed, and
fellows, who dare to express wishes for the humiliation of one of the
QUEEN’s allies in time of War, bundled out of the country neck and
crop. “With all loyalty to our Gracious Sovereign,” forsooth, these
worthies pretend to combine that traitorous wish-traitorous in regard
to QUEEN VICTORIA. . All their loyalty may seem to be a ...? little all
—but it must be considered, that the real sovereign of these foreigners
is Pius THE NINTH, Pope of Rome...The paper whence the above
passage is taken is one of the organs of the papal residents in England,
called the Catholic Standard. It is said to be the official organ of
CARDINAL, WISEMAN; which we hope is not true; if it is, we can only
say that what is sauce for L’Homme should be sauce for the Catholic
Standard, and that Aliens who are tarred with the same brush, ought
also to be indiscriminately feathered.

It must be confessed, that the *. are not clever at Masquerades.
“The fact is, (says Öld Whyte Choaker of Exeter Hall), the wild
recklessness, the furious abandon, the dishevelled riotousness of your
continental carnivals cannot be transplanted into an English soil. The
national character, Sir, is against it. Thank Heaven, a French mas-
querade in England is quite a Moral Impossibility!”
Look out Below !
An article on the Improvement of the Dwellings of the ºi

the inhabitants, but it is 5.ºf at least to know, that "the houses
of the poor fall under (instead of over) several heads,” which might
otherwise be placed in considerable jeopardy.

I do not want to give you too many illustrations of the beautiful system
of swindle, by means of which lawyers thrive and land is an article kept
out of the market, but I must just show you another step or two in the
history of the Work-table.
Will you be kind enough to look back to our last lecture? You will
see that it comprises DE KAVIL's objections to the title. These
objections were laid before MR. GRUBBY, that he might answer them.
And he did so in this way.
“With all deference to the opinion of the eminent counsel who has
perused this abstract, I retain my opinion of the perfect, goodness of
ihe title. The question, whether the Work-table does not belong to the
§ of ENGLAND, as forfeited by the presumed treason of the
acobite officer, may be thus disposed of. The rebellion (see SMolleTT,
PINNock's Catechism, GoLDSMITH, HAYDN's Dates, the Stream of Time,
the Penny History of England, &c.) took place in 1745. We are now
in 1855. A simple arithmetical process will show that the distance
between the two dates is l10 years. By the statute of Nullum Tempus,
which seems to have escaped the learned counsel's memory, the time
for forfeiture is limited to 60 years. Now, we have had quiet enjoy-
ment for 109 years, and we do not mean to let in the Sovereign.
“As regards the difference between the signatures ‘LETTY” and
‘LETITIA, I admit that the difficulty is considerable. Reasoning by
analogy, it is as fair to presume that a lady named ‘LETITIA’ should,
in the permitted licence of playfulness and affection, be called ‘LETTY,
as that another, who has been christened ‘MARGARET,” should be
called |MAngº, ‘Meg, or even "MEGGUMs;’ that “ALIce' should be
termed 'LAL;' or ‘MARy Cºtigning” abbreviated and condensed
into “Pol-KITT.’ But more stringent proof may perhaps be reasonably
demanded, and we will obtain a commission to send and examine wit:
nesses, in several of the counties, of England, where old-fashioned
names are most likely to linger, as to the use of the word ‘LETTY.”
Affidavits shall also be obtained from old inhabitants who may have
known similar abbreviations.
“Deeds of renunciation shall be procured from the descendants of
the Jacobite officer. These number, about one hundred and twelve.
Qne is a lunatic, and therefore we shall be obliged to issue a commission
de lunatico inquirendo against him, and get up evidence of his lunacy,
but this will not be very difficult, for we are instructed that he is fre-
uently detected in reading the Morning Advertiser. We believe that
the hundred and eleven will sign; but if not, a friendly Chancery suit
will be the shortest way to induce them to do so.
“The lady and her husband are so far from being alive, that they
have been dead for seventy years. A certificate of the burial of the
former shall be obtained, but he went to America, and died there
shortly after the breaking out of the Revolutionary War I think at
this distance of time his death may be assumed, as few men of active
lives survive over 150 years. But, if insisted on, we will send over to
America for evidence. -
“Of the missing knob we can give no account, except a tradition in
the family, that one day a nursemaid rushed up-stairs to her mistress
§: Swansdown's mother) and exclaiming, O, Mum, Mum, Mum,
iss have been and swallerd it,” immediately fell into a large spongin
3ath full of water. On investigation the ūj little gir j
that she had swallowed nothing. It is thought that the article referred
to as ‘it’ was the knob in question, and that its being silver had
tempted the cupidity of the girl, who had recourse to this ingenious
method of diverting suspicion. Mrs. Swanspown will have no objec-
tion to let the knob be replaced by some respectable silversmith.
“As regards the date of the letter, 46, I think it is not likely that a
lady, shown to be alive and young in 1746, would have, written, a
sportive letter in 1646, or in 1846, but evidence as to the date of the
rebellion shall be furnished.
“The reason why MRs. SwansDown's mother received the gift,
instead of any of her sixteen brothers and sisters, is stated in a docu-
ment, of which a copy is herewith sent. It was fº her for being the
.# one of the lot who would take black draught, jalap, or castor-oil,
without being previously whipped, and having her nose ...; during the
administration of the medicament. The family apothecary, now of a
great age, but in perfect retention of his faculties, is willing to depose
to this fact, which he well remembers. We will endeavour, however,
to obtain the hundred and º signatures, and give a covenant or
guarantee against claim by any who decline to join.
“The searches in the various registers shall be made, but MR. DE
KAVIL is in error in supposing the donor's husband to have been a
Catholic. He had no particular religion, beyond that of an officer,
until he went to America, where he became a Quaker, and preached
non-resistance, to the great disgust of GENERAL WASHINGTON.
“GIDEON GRUBBy,
“Lincoln's Inn.”
This being sent back to MR. DE KAVII, he made a variety of counter-
replies, and at last it was thought best that the two learned gentlemen
should meet and talk over the business. For this purpose, what is
called a Consultation was arranged, at which the two counsel and the
two attorneys attended, and you also shall attend, my dears, if you like.

A GLUT OF NATIONAL ANTHEMS.
THE visit of the KING OF SARDINIA to the EMPEROR OF THE
FRENCH has necessitated the addition of another national anthem to the
repertoire of all the French orchestras. If the alliance against Russia
should become general, it will be impossible in the .."; of any of
the Allies to §: up a concert the programme of which will consist of
...; but National Anthems. ready the Mons. JULLIEN is com:
pelled to devote nearly one-fourth of his orchestral performances to God
Save the Queen, Rule Britannia, and Partant pour la Syrie, which are
usually played twice each, at least, in every evening, and these are about
to be added to by the introduction of the Sardinian, with possibly also
the Turkish National Anthem. Of course we can have no objection to
these compliments being paid to our Allies, but we merely point out the
fact, that if Sweden joins with us (as we are told it will), if Austria
should become our ally (as we hope it will not), and if Prussia should be
ermitted to associate with us (as we don’t think it ought), there will
§. no less than eight National Airs or Anthems to be performed and
encored at every concert in London. This will give a tremendous total
of sixteen pieces of a Fº or complimentary nature to be gone
through, irrespective of any other addition that may be made to the
programme. We must therefore suggest, that if all the contemplated
alliances should take place, we must be satisfied to give up all other
music, and content ourselves with concerts consisting entirely of
National Anthems.

Humanity and Moral Philosophy are also paid for at the same

Moral Philosophers have sometimes dodges of their own, which are
frequently turned to º account; for we have known philan-
thropists and moralists whose names have been better known in the
Courts of Law than in the Schools, and are more often in the mouths
of the bailiffs than on the lips of the truth-seeker. We do not however
believe that the ill-paid teh Professors have any such doubtful

his hair perfectly black. All his teeth were in the finest preservation. In brief, he

THE HEROES OF THE CITY.
THE public may not be generally aware, that the military resources of
the City are not limited to her Artillery: but that there is a body—a
very extensive body as far as corpulency is concerned—called the Court of
Lieutenancy of the City of london. This extensive—we use the word
in reference rather to fat than to numbers; this extensive force consists
chiefly of a body (a very pinguid body), of tradesmen, who wear a
military, uniform, and are chiefly to be found on duty at a lon
House dinner, where the sword is converted into a knife, and where the
fork may be said tº change places with the scabbard., These civic
warriors are generally foremost where anything like war to the knife is
ing on; and they have º: assisted at the ºf of a 'great
eal more than has been º for them. We perceive that the troop
has been called together by the LoRD MAYoR, that the Members may
have an opportunity of expressing their feelings on the occasion of the
Visit of the KING, or SARDINIA...Unless they are all going to talk to
His Majesty, we do not see how they can express, their feelings other:
wise than by a stare; and, as the Monarch will be sufficiently stared
at by thousands of others, we think the Deputy-Lieutenants had better
be left to mind their shops or other business; for, if called out, they will
give no satisfaction.
The Idol Trade.
A NUMBER of little images in brass of John BRIGHT, Connnn
GLADSTONE, and other Russian Saints, have been manufac In
thousands and tens of thousands at Birmingham, for the purpose of
being forwarded to St. Petersburgh. It is the intention of, the
EMPEROR, after they have been duly blest by his priests, to distribute
them tº his valiant soldiers as the highest possible reward of merit.
More than this, they will be § held up to them as infallible
talismans against the attacks of the English. The breast of the Russian
soldier, that treasures the image of such a patriot as John BRIGHT,
must be invulnerable ! The Cossack, who on the battle-field feels he
has CoEDEN or GLADSTONE by his side to defend him, is sure, by the
mere force of inspiration, to perform prodigies of valour!

THE LATEST ROMISH MIRACLE.
ExTRAoRDINARY APPEARANCE OF THE AUSTRIAN SPLIT CROW, CAUBRD
BY THE RECENT CONCORDAT.
PROSPECTUS OF MR. PUNCH'S RUSSIAN
WOCABULARY.
DR. Max MüII.ER has published an interesting little work On the
Languages 3. the Seat of War. M. SAUERwels announces his
Tº Pocket Dictionary for the use of officers. Mr. Punch begs to
put forward a prospectus of his Russian Kocabulary for the use of the
world in general, and the subjects, victims, and dupes of Russia in
particular. - -
The work will be published in parts, each part to appear at the
close of a year's campaign, so as to keep pace with the rapid changes
in the meaning of Russian words, according to the progress of eyents.
The work ºf be in the largest possible size for the accommodation
of the Russian words, which are known to be extremely big, especially
in the number published for the first i. - -
As the War proceeds, the size of the numbers will be reduced, with
the gradual reduction in the bigness of the Russian words. -
ords, for which the Russian language has no exact representatives,
but which yet cannot be spared in a Vocabulary intended fºr, the use
of Non-Russian populations, such as “truth,” “faith,” honour,”
“friendship,” º . represented by the periphrases, used for the
expression of these ideas in the Chancelleries of the Russian diplo-
mºtic service. Mr. Punch regrets to say, that these periphrases will
be found most unsatisfactory, but they are the only ones which pass
current in Russia, and it is essential to be familiar with them, if we
would estimate the meaning, and, above all, if we should have to
encounter the acuteness of Russian diplomates.
The Russian words have been extracted -
authority, such as the general orders and bulletins of her Qom.
manders, the proclamations of the Czar, the official pºrtions ºf the
fºrgiº.” Russº, the Northern Bee, Le Nord, L’Assemblée Nationale,
and other Russian Journals.
The following examples will convey an idea of the style in which the
work will be executed:-
“Pictory.”—When used of a Russian army, any achievement which
results in anything that can be exhibited,
flag, a cannon, aſ assured that its case shall meet with eve
ſº ...”iº The word is never used of a
oreign army. Instead of it the following º: may be
employed;—“Stubborn resistance,” “movement in advance.”
“reconnaissance,”, “deplorable, blunder,” “ incomprehensible
delusion.” (Bulletins: Gortschakoff, Osten Sacken, Liprandi.)
“Movement ºf Concentration.” - When used of a Russian garrison
Evacuation of a town under the assault of the Enemy. (Word,
Invalide Russe.) When used of an army in the field, #he being
driven off the ground. E.g.: “The movement of concentration
of Sebastopol.” “The movement of concentration of the Alma.”
(Idem,
-- sº Sortie.”—When used of a Russian force, the coming out
of a large force, and their .# driven back by a small force of the
Enemy. E.g.: “The successful sortie of the 5th of November.”
(Russian Correspondence in Der Wanderer.
“Repulse.”—Never used of Russian troops. When used of a hostile
force—The return of troops to quarters, whether after a victory
a reconnaissance, or a foraging expedition. E.g.: “The repulse o
GENERAL D'ALLONVILLE from Sak.” (Northern Bee.)
“Guarantee.”—“Anything taken, with no intention of returning it.”
E.g.: "For this Finland shall be held as guarantee.” (Proclama-
tion ºf the Czar Alexander the First to the Finnish nation, 1809.)
“Protection."—Taking possession of a country by an armed force,
garrisoning its towns, appropriating its revenues, and displacing its
authorities. E.g.: “Georgia, was then under the Protection of
Russia.” (History of Russia for the use ºf Schools.)
“Decrepit Nationality.”—Any nationality too weak to resist Russia.
E.g.: “The decrepit nationality of the Crim Tartars.” (Corre.
spondence ºf Catherine the Great.
“Destiny.”—When used of Russia–The determination to get all that
can be got. E.g.: “I have faith in the destiny of my nation.”
(Will of Peter the Great.)
“Sick Man.”—Applied to any potentate whose dominions"Russia seeks
to appropriate. (Sirthamilton Seymour's notes of Conversation
with the Emperor Alexander.)
“Enthusiasm.”—When used of recruits—Handcuffs, and fear of the
Knout. E.g.: “The children of the soil flock to the Army with
enthusiasm.” (The Czar's address to the Army,
“Sedition.”—Any statement by a Russian of facts offensive to authority.
ºf: of the Police of St. Petersburg,ſº
“Allies.”—Tools; persons to be cajoled first into weakness, then
bullied into resistance, and finally absorbed. (History of Europe.)
“Negotiations.”—Any pretext for talking in order to gain time.
E. g. “The Czak has never shown himself averse to negotiation.”
(NEssFIRoDE's Circular to Russian Diplomatic Agents.)
“Offerings.”—“ Sºlies, serfs, or money, taken for the use of the
Army.” E.g. “The offerings of the landholders continue topourin.”
The Nort Bee, L’Invalide Russe, Kreuz-Zeitung, Nord,
*Assemblée Nationale, and other Russian Official Newspapore
published at Brussels, Berlin, Paris, and St. Petersburg.)
A KEY TO THE ANTI-MOUSTACHE MOVEMENT.
WE lately noticed an order of the Directors of the Newcastle Bank
to all their moustached clerks, to “shave or resign.” The following
extract from the Assize intelligence of the Northern Circuit will throw
some light on the matter:-
“(Before Ma. BABox MARTIN.)
“THE QUEEN v. Robert MARTINson, THE Young ER.
“The prisoner, a good-looking and fashionably-attired young man, wearing mous-
taches, was indicted for having, on the 19th of July, 1855, he then being Clerk to
WILLIAM BERNARD Ogden, the public officer of the Northumberland and Durham
District Banking Company, feloniously embezzled £4,264, received by him on account
of his said master.
“The prisoner pleaded “Guilty.'”
We do not exactly see the force of the reasoning; but there can be
no doubt that the Directors have come to the conclusion, that the
moustaches have done, it all. The new regulation proves that the
Directors are now particular to a hair in the selection of their clerks.
The Right Step in the Right Place.
ONE of the movements in Mons. JULLIEN's Sebastopol. Quadrille,
from works of officialli” º: (by the author of the playbill, who must evidently be a
man of great imaginative talent) to be descriptive of the movement of
the Russian army across their floating-bridge on the night after the
assault. Not having much Terpsichorean ingenuity, we are somewhat
at a loss to know how this description can be realised in dancing;
unless, as we have overheard a wag suggest, it be done by a sort of
chassez across-eh?
THE CAREER or A, DEPUTATION.—It is courteously received—it is
consideration-it is politely
as a
musket. Eg., "The Victory of Sinope,” the “Victory of Hango.” |bowed out—and then you never hear anything more of it.

“Ring vich? Vy, that won, in course.-7’’other's only for the Flunkies.”
A REALLY G00D OPENING.
. SomeBody once offered to anybody an almost fabulous sum for the
invention of a new excitement; and perhaps, in the overcrowded state
of our Metropolitan streets, that individual may be said to deserve well
of his fellow-citizens who invents a new thoroughfare. The discovery
has been made, and the public may now pass from the Strand, to the
Suspension ; without being jostled } dealers in shrimps,
requested to purchase a live lobster, or ‘. in head and shoulders
to buy a cod; for all this fishy fussy perambulation is prevented by the
opening of the Hall of Hungerford. This measure has effected, in a
small way, for this part of the world, what the cutting, through of the
Isthmus of Suez is expected to accomplish for its own locality.
In addition to its advantages as a short cut, the Hall of Hungerford
presents to the intelligent mind a variety of food far more ;
than the fish at the stalls, the penny ices round the corner, or the *:::
low-priced pies at the “genteel dining-room”, which nestles near, the
base of the building. Hungerford, Hall is full of information, where
those who run may read, while, those who walk may peruse more
leisurely a mass of announcements, where every want is offered to be
*. and every longing satisfied. The walls are in fact, covered
Wit advertisements, presenting a large. mass of broadside lite-
rature, such as could not be found within the walls of any other
building in the universe. If you want to insure your life, or buy a bed,
take a bottle of soda-water or a pinch of snuff, purchase a rick-cloth or a
wig, a pair of shoes, an estate, an organ, or a pound of grapes, you will
find at Hungerford Hall the particulars as to where any or all of
these articles inº: attainable. To the gentleman of bad
address or no address at all, the opportunity is afforded of having his
correspondence directed to him, at the high-sounding and central Hall
of Hungerford, No ºf: is...it necessary to rent a door plate as in the
olden time, or trust to, the reluctant and sometimes oblivious green-
grocer to take in all letters;” for now, by a small payment, anybody
may give Hungerford Hall as his address, and be sure of getting every
communication that is intended for him. Apart from its commercial uses,
we recommend the lover of architectural proportions, or disproportions,
to pay a visit to º Hall, which #. take its ; by the
side of Westminster Hall—if it were not half a mile distant,
TWO POETS IN A PULPIT.
MR. PUNCH seems to have given some kind of umb
to a couple of excitable #.º.e auctioneers. They reside
at Stokésley, and take the opportunity of being selected to
sell five young cows, three fat ewes, some pig-troughs, and
other trifles, to burst into the following lyric appeal to the
world.
“We are two faithful Auctioneers;
With mirth we use the hammer.
Some of our Puffs they do seem queer,
And make that old Punch stammer!!
Mr. Punch hastens to assure the poets in question, that
he entertains towards them the most friendly feeling; that
he never heard of them, or of Stokesley, until he received
the above notification, and that though they modestly admit
the queerness of their puffs, he never stammered at them in
aſ his life. He fears that he has been made a victim to the
exigences of verse, and that when “hammer” imperativel
called for a corresponding rhyme, the poet forgot—whi
was odd for auctioneers—that there was such a word as
“crammer.” However, he repeats the assurance of his
friendliest feelings, and hopes that on the day of sale the
pulpit did justice to the pig-troughs.
A QUESTIONABLE FASHION.
THAT i.; pretty periodical, Le Follet, in announcing
the “Fashions for December,” states that
* Braces also continue in great favour."
“Braces also.” What besides Braces? The answer is
obvious to the masculine mind, and surely cannot be dubious
to the feminine; for the least logical of ladies even must
be alive to the inference from Braces. . Of course it must
be presumed that Braces are fashionable amongst wives
.. for the rest of the fair sex cannot be very
intelligibly in a position to wear the Braces. From the
prevalence of this female fashion of Braces, it would seem,
that the Rights of Woman have obtained a rather wide
recognition; unless indeed we have been speculating on the
delusive basis of a §§ error, and, for “Braces,”
ought to have read “Bracelets.”
A GREAT LADY-TRAVELLER.
MADAME IDA PFEIFFER has been twice round the Globe, but we
think we know a far greater traveller than she is. There is Mrs. Ap,
Robinson, of Keatish Town, who has just succeeded for the third
time in making a tour round the Promenade Concerts of Juillen'sſ She
started from the Pit entrance, in the centre of the house, threaded the
narrow passages that skirt each side of the Proscenium, doubled the
orchestra (the latter, as all travellers know, a most difficult bit of
navigation), paid an exploring visit to the ºf...; took in pro-
visions (a cup of coffee, and a bishop's thumb) at the refreshment stall
and arrived in safety at the point, she started from, after an absence of
less than three hours! She speaks of the wild tribes she encountered
in her journey as being extremely savage, rude, and uncivilised to the
last degree of what, in barbarian circles, is called “Gentishness;” and
congratulates herself upon having arrived at her journey's end without
. or serious damage...The population, she states, is excessivel
thick—so dense at times, that it was almost impossible to p
The natives are frightfully wild, and, indulge occasionally in certain
vulgar games—one of which called “forming, a ring,” seemed to be
highly popular. It is her astonishment, considering the rough way in
which §. was treated, and the dangers to which she was every now and
then exposed, how she escaped without an accident. This journey is
very peculiar, as we never recollect lº, of an instance of a lady,
who É. ever made the tour of Jullie N's Concerts before... To have
accomplished it not less than three times is indeed a daring feat of
courage and perseverance that places the name of MRs. ADA RoBINson
amongst the foremost of our female travellers!
A White Lie.
THERE is no truth, in the report that his MAJESTY SouLouque,
EMPEROR OF HAYTI, has entered into negotiations for a Concordat
with the Pope, and has insisted that as a basis of agreement, his
Horness shall engage himself, at the next vacancy to create a black
Cardinal. We are authorised in #. that SouLouque will consent
tºº arrangement, because his sa le Majesty himself is too deep

We are, however, merging a particular case in the general question, and we will
therefore proceed at once to quote a few verses which might appropriately figure
in the Rogue's Album, or The Domestic Servant's Manual ºf the Art of Rºbbing a
Master. After a prosaic intimation, that “24d. to 3d per lb. is given for kitchen-
stuff, and 4d. for good dripping” the poet of the grease-pot thus proceeds:-

MR, PUNCHPS GENERAL ORDER.
Urgest Private irs.
ryes! Affairs Head Quarters.
..We have at times had occasion to express sentiments in some degree
differing from those which have been attributed to illustrious person-
ages, of various nations. But upon, no occasion, we trust, have we
sought to render Royalty contemptible. That work we leave to its
friends the flunkeys, and it will be seen from the following age,
taken from the Morning Post's account of the progress of the KING of
SARDINIA through the Westminster Road, on the day, of his arrival,
that they address themselves to it with no ordinary skill. . The readers
of the Morning Post are not as a body the wisest le in the world,
and what must be the result of their being induced to believe that the
PRINCE ALBERT, an educated man, a scholar, and a gentleman of taste,
could think or talk such penny-a-liner's balderdash, as it “appeared” to
the Post that he was inflicting on his Wife's Ally?
“His Roy AL HIGHNEss appeared to be explaining that these were the men
(MAUDslay's), the skilled artisans of England, to whose industry and art were due the
works which, of old, were ascribed to giants; that these men bridged the seas and
spanned the earth with iron girdles; that by them were those chariots forged which
speed our friends on their º fleeter than the wind; by them were those bolts forged
which hurled a fiery destruction on our enemies.”
There is the libel,and as truth ºf pleaded injustification,-first,
because the PRINCE could not have talked such ineffable trash, and,
secondly, because, if he had, the writer for the Post could know nothing
about it, we have enclosed the paragraph to SIR ALEXANDER JAMEs
Edward CocKBURN, M.P., HERMAJESTY's Attorney-General.
ETER THE GREAT AND ST. PETER.-The Pope, like the ror
Alexander, has had his ; levy, for what is the Concordat but a
levy of the Austrians en mass
FIELD-MARsHAL PUNCH has observed with equal surprise and
concern the extraordinary number of applications from officers of all
: - and arms of the service, to return home on “urgent private
alts.
F. M. PUNCH has one and the same answer for all such applications.
He cannot #. leave of absence to officers for urgent private affairs;
while the following most urgent private affairs require the presence of
officers in camp, viz.:-
Hutting the privates.
Keeping up the discipline of the privates.
Keeping down drunkenness among the privates.
Promoting rational amusement among the privates.
Sharing the hardships of the privates, and
Setting a good example to the privates generally.
All these appear to F. M. PUNCH to be the most urgent,"private”
affairs that can be conceived under existing circumstances.
An Extraordinary Mistake.
In the account of the opening of the Prussian Chambers by KING
CLICQUOT the reporter writes-
“The KING entered the saloon in full General's uniform, and carrying his helmet
in his hand.”
This is a palpable blunder. It was not a helmet, but a wine-cooler.
fact is established by the subsequent incident; for the reporter in
ue time tells us, that “the KING put it on his head!”

THE ORIGINAL ROUND HAT.
Old Lady. (log.) “WHAT CAN THEY SEE TO LAUGH AT; NASTY RUDE PEOPLE P IT's A very SENSIBLE HAT-ESPECIALLY FOR
Those who DoN'T LIKE A STRONG LIGHT.”
THE DISSATISFIED INDEPENDENTS.
Poor MR. SERIEANT SHEE, despondent at the humiliated condition
of the hungry Irish Brigade, has been writing, a letter to one of the
Hibernian papers, setting out his conviction, that in the next session,
the only chance for the Band to make itself felt—that, is, to get its
members into places under Government—is to adopt “a determined
course of dissatisfied independence; not only in regard to important
uestions, but in every-day matters.” By being generally disagreeable
§. Irish members, according to the great patriot SHEE, may compel
LoRD PALMERSTON to fling them sops to keep them quiet. . . .
We understand that on the Serjeant's suggestion, the Dissatisfied
Independents are having rehearsals, in order to be ready for the open-
ing of Parliament. A correspondent in Dublin informs us that they
go through the whole business of an evening's debate, and get up a
row upon each of the “Every-day matters” as it arises. He sends us
a list of some of the manifestations of “dissatisfaction.”
When the Spaker takes the cheer, he is to be º: for
#: an English, Scotch, or Welsh mimber catch his eye before an
18m. One.
When he shouts out the name of an Irish mimber, he is to be abused
for not spaking in a more deferential tone. ..
When any mimber spakes of the “English”, army in the Crimea,
or of “British” arrums, he is to be assaulted by six Irish spakers in
succession. - - - -
No bill is to be allowed to be inthrojuiced that does not in some way
refer to Oireland—or if it be permitted to be brought in, Irish clauses
are to be added. For instance, to an India bill, a provision is to be
appended, that the next Governor-General shall be an Irishman, and
§ .# * of taxation, a proviso that it shall not apply to poor
Ireland.
The House and the Spaker are to be made to understand, that when
an Irish mimber wants to º: all others give way.
All Irish petitions are to have precedence of English ones, and are to
be read at full length by the chap in the small :
If any mimber cries "question”, while an Irish mimber is spaking,
the Brigade pledges itself to move his impachement.
..One Government night in each week is to be given up to the exclusive
discussion of Irish questions, and if MR. #. ever permits a
“no-house" upon such a night, he is to be exterminated.
In counting the House, the Spaker is to reckon every Irish mimber
as two; he being worth any two of his malignant oppressors.
In the case of a row between Irish . no English or Scotch
ones are to, presume to interfere, but the spapeems are to wait in
respectful silence until the gentlemen are plazed to be done.
t is for the Irish mimbers to settle what time the House shall rise;
and no one is to take the liberty of going away until the desire of the
Brigade has been signified.
It is to be made a standing order, that MR. HENRY DRUMMOND is
not to make any profane fun of a Roman Catholic saint, praste, reli
or miracle, and on the least allusion of that kind, he is to be committe
to the custody of the Serjeant at Arrums.
With the aid of these, and similar improvements upon the present
system, MR, SERIEANT Širº and his friends hope soon to diminish the
causes for their Dissatisfaction, by procuring a market for some of the
Independence, which, like tradesmen anxious to sell, they now puff so
lustily. The worst of it all is, that parties are so evenly balanced in
the House,that such a set of gentſemen, after such an avowal, may
command their price.
MORE LAURELS FOR PRUSSIA.
LIEUTENANT GENESTE has published the official account of the
Hango massacre; it seems that the murders were committed in due
form, and by the most regular butchers. The men were not slaughtered
under the sanctity of a flag, of truce by a raw, rash, undisciplined
troop of marauders; but killed in all due form, and in the coldest
blood by “one of the best Russian regiments, the Grenadiers of
FREDERick WILLIAM or PRussia, as they are called, the KING OF
PRussia being their Colonel.”. It is expected that the flag, of truce
will be sent as a trophy-atrophy of "a dignified neutrality”-to the
King-Colonel; and further, that the Grenadiers, which his Prussian
Majesty delights to command, will henceforth carry, emblazoned on
their regimental flag, the word-"Hango.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 241
Cattle Show, Sir I'll take you all the way there for a Penny.”
THE OMNIBUS COMMITTEE.
It is not generally known that, with a resolution to meet and over-
come the opposition threatened by our gallant Allies to the British
Omnibus, the proprietors of these native vehicles have resolved to-to-
yes, to make an omnibus really comfortable. With this intent, a com-
mittee has been sitting for the last week at the Shillibeer Arms; and
although the press—as the press—was excluded, Mr. Punch was, o
course, invited to send a guinea-and-a-half-a-liner (the rise of the half-
guinea, dates from the late advance of provisions) to, the Shillibeer;
Our faithful retainer, like “the bee with honey'd thigh,” duly rendered
himself at 85, Fleet-street, laden with evidence anxious { sought by the
committee, and readily, supplied by all, conditions of people. It is
observable that the female evidence greatly preponderates, an omnibus
evidently being considered by them a woman's question. It is, how-
ever, impossible for Mr. Punch to do more than to cull, with a very
light and careful hand, certain samples from the evidence adduced.
MR. John PollewHISTLE examined.
Rides daily from .#; to Old Jewry. Believes that babies-in-
arms are the great blight of 'busses. Would have no child under seven
ride, the register to be first shown to the conductor. Has a strong
objection, in a crowded 'bus, to have his shirt-collar smeared by the
dear infant next him with a raspberry tart. With respect to luggage—
that is, female luggage—would not permit any woman passenger to
bring luggage into a 'bus of more than twelve cubic inches. Yes: he
stand, at the door of the 'bus... Wouldn't be hard upon parasols;
though could not, for the life of him, see the use of 'em.
MRs. MARY QUILTER eramined.
Often rode in a 'bus. Was generally set down near Swan-AND-
EDGAR's. Thought that it was not always pleasant to be flung into
people’s lap. ; sometimes less so than others, and sometimes quite the
reverse. The conductors would say “all right ” before a lady was in
her ſº º that if a rope, something like a bell-rope, was hung
up along the roof, it would be a great assistance, especially when the
conductors would say “all right.” With respect to luggage, did not
think four band-boxes and a small child with, a drum and a hoop too
much for the mother of a family., Thought that a magistrate ought to
be able to fine anybody, if a single man, who refused to ride outside in
the rain to oblige a lady.
Miss ARABELLA PERKINs eramined.
Seldom rode in an omnibus, but had done so on dividend days to the
ank; since that most wicked and shocking double Income Tax to
* the War, undertaken as she understood to support the infidel
Turks, who sew up poor women in sacks and -certainly, yes; she would
keep to the question of the omnibus, Well, she brought to
had Fº his attention to umbrellas. He would have an umbrella-
ride in the thing, but †† since the Income-Tax,-never before: and all
she hoped was, that all of us might five to see the end of the War—but
for her part—very well; yes, she would keep to the omnibus. What
had she to propose—what to object to? Well, then, she wished to
speak upon the omnibus straw. hy not put down a Brussels carpet
and in a season of such inclemency as the present, why not have bottleso
hot water? People might get their death, and what would the omnibus
care? Yes; she was coming to the straw as fast as she could. Had a
great objection at all times to the straw in the 'bus; when it was old it
was dirty and damp; and when it was new, it was * and tickled,
Thought the whole difficulty might be met by a strip of Brussels.
MR. JABEz Mogsby earamined,
Sorry to say, had given much of his time to omnibuses. Thought
for a rope under the roof should be substituted a stout brass bar; for
from the gentlewomen he’d seen ride in "busses, believed that no ;
would long bear 'em. ...And this º him to what he had specia
to say. Providence hadn’t made us alſ alike—and, therefore, he looke
upon it as little less than presumption to say, that a 'bus should carry
twelve inside. The law was arbitrary and un-English. What’s
twelve? Twelve Tom Thumbs—twelve Daniel Lamberts! He would,
therefore, have arms—arms to all the seats: when every man, woman,
and child, whatever they might be, would sit upon their own merits.
Miss ARABELLA MITTENs examined.
She occasionally rode in 'busses. Had given some attention to the
last improvement under M.R. FITzRoy's Act: she alluded to the light
now burnt in the interior of the 'bus. Thought altogether it worked
well, , Had ridden in a Paris 'bus or two: she should think so. She
thought, then, if a small mirror was put up at the end of the English
"bus, it would help, to give a cheerful . to the interior gene-
rally. When the 'bus was full, the looking-glass, might be positivel
tºl, ºil. in an uncertain climate, with the Black that :
fly so hen nobody at, all was in the 'bus—as had sometimes hap-
pened to herself-wby, a looking-glass was always company.
MR. Jollidogs examined.
Used to use "busses, but had given 'em up. Why should he be made
miserable? Every 'bus was placarded with puffs of burying-grounds;
might as well ride in a hearse. Didn't see why the 'bus driver shouldn’t
have a hat-band, and the horses feathers in their heads. Had had his
dinner spoilt more than once by the bills about the Neckandcropolis
Burying Grounds all over the 'bus. Didn't object to advertisements in
'busses on a º for this was a commercial country—thought there
was no harm in “Six Shirts for 30s,” if they were worth anything—
but , thought it too bad to be always given the blues by the
Neckandcropolis.
Mr. Punch concludes his extracts with this; regretting that he has
no room for the very valuable testimony of the REveREND MR. SPIKE-
NARD, on the impropriety of religious controversies in "busses generally.
The Reverend gentleman had been compelled to discontinue the use of
the Knightsbridge 'busses since the shameful persecution of St. Bar-
nabus and St. Mary's. Thought that a line of 'busses—The Lamb and
Flag line—if comfortably hassocked and glazed with painted windows,
would meet with great encouragement in the neighbourhood of
Knightsbridge and Belgravia.
No report has yet been made; but Mr. Punch has a lively hope that
| certain points of the evidence will have a telling effect upon the mind
of the Committee. A fixed cubic measurement is certainly desirable;
neither is the º; or bar suggested by MRs. QUILTER unworthy
of attention. Even Mr. Punch himself has found the omnibus straw
|unpleasant; and therefore wholly agrees in the objections so graphically
rendered by Miss PERKINs; and believes, with her, that there is some-
thing in hot water and carpets of Brussels' texture. Surely, too,
there is good sense in the Pºiº of MR. Mogsby. The adoption
of arms in the 'bus would so define every place for every passenger;
whilst the measure so admirably harmonises with our habits and feelings
as a domestic people. With respect to the mirror suggested by Miss
MITTENS, we think we must leave that an open question. Possibly,
some of the Committee will take the opinion of their own wives upon the
|matter...As to the Neckandcropolis advertisements, we do not think that
an omnibus should in any way suggest a charnel-house; though, alike
with MR. Joi IIDogs, we do not object to the commercial genius of our
country clinging to the roof of a busiike a bat to the .#of a church.
In all seriousness, we trust that the English Committee will lose no
time in setting the English.'bus in order; otherwise, they may rest
i. º our faithful Allies will take the very needful work out of
€lr Ilands,
Serenade for Sir Charles Napier.
A PARTY of Southwark Electors, on Tuesday, evening, assembled
under the window of Šm Chaºs Nºnº's residence, and celebrated
the honourable and gallant officer's election for Southwark, by singing
the appropriate song of the “Return ºf the Admiral.”

z A COMMENTATOR ON COLONEL HAWKUR.
HIs Royal HIGHNEss PRINCE ALBERT appears to be
rather fond of lecturing to young men; it is a labour of
love to him seemingly, and one, which he performs to
admiration. Now, in the Court Circular, passim, it will be
read that
“PancE ALBERT went out Shooting.”
Shooting is an amusement to which young men are
naturally partial; many of them, if they had little else to
do, would do little else. But how many lamentable acci-
dents from fire-arms are daily recorded in the Newspapers!
A few observations from the PRINCE, when he has the
opportunity, on loading, priming, &c., with which opera-
tions his Royal HIGHNess must of necessity be familiar,
as also on the proper method of carrying the gun, so that
no fellow-sportsman shall ever find himself looking down
the muzzle, might prove the means of preventing many
untimely deaths, if not of saving some valuable lives.
The lives, also, of numerous yellow-hammers and green-
finches, sacrificed by juvenile metropolitan and inexperi:
enced fowlers for snipes and partridges, might be saved
through the judicious admonitions of the PRINCE. And
whilst he was about it, PRINCE ALBERT might do good
service by communicating the results of his experience in
fox-hunting to ambitious but awkward riders.
SCIENCE UNDER SEVERAL, HEADS.
EveRYBoDY who is curious as to the very odd things that
ladies take into their heads, or on, to their heads, should go
to the Polytechnic Institution; where—amidst the hundrei
other attractions—is being delivered a lecture on Ladies'
Head-Dresses, from the Time of William the Conqueror.
When we look at some of the massive structures that
have been raised upon the female head from time to time,
we wonder whether the object has been to make up for
the want of furniture within, by a tremendous pile of
external ornament. It must, however, be admitted, that
those ladies who have stood erect under the ponderous
arrangements with which fashion has occasionally encum-
bered their brows, could not have been very weak-headed.
A Consuming TRUTH-Men never begrudge the money
they spend on dinners nor women on pastry.
DETERMINED SUICIDES IN THE ARCHDIOCESS
OF WESTMINSTER.
THE well-known papal advocate, MR; GeoRGE Bowy ER, in a letter of
reply to DR. CUMMING, published in the Times, makes the following
admission:-
“I will only add that DR. CUMMING will find a parallel to the 16th article of the
Concordat, which so much alarms him, in statute 1st ELIZABETH, c. 2, which forbids
anything said or done in derogation of the poor of Common Prayer.”
Just so. The statute 1st ELIZABETH, c. 2, inflicted penalties on the
riests who should refuse to read the Prayer book in their churches.
he first offence on the part of the recusant priest was punished by the
forfeiture of a year's revenue of his benefice, and six months' imprison-
ment. The second, by loss of all ecclesiastical property and imprison-
ment for life. For speaking in derogation of the Prayer-book, or for
satirising or burlesquing the Reformed Church, the penalty was a fine of
one hundred marks for the first offence, four hundred ditto for the
second ditto (£1000 of our present money); for the third, forfeiture of
all goods and chattels, and perpetual imprisoninent.... Everybody was
bound to attend the church service under divers penalties, or on pain of
imprisonment. Prelates and other church dignitaries were empowered
to inflict these punishments. Does not. QoEBETT in his Legacy to
Parsons, pp. 35,36, chronicle these atrocities? And to these same
Elizabethan atrocities of 1558, now obsolete, if not repealed, the
Concordat of PIUs THE NINTH., A. D. 1855, according to
Bowyer, affords a parallel. Austrian Protestants are to be subjected
to the same persecution now, as that which English º: were to
incur º ust not. Fancy, "...º. º depict sº
as an unhappy pig, swimming up stream, and inflicting the injury
§: * Animal inflicts, under those circumstance, on his own
throat
What will CARDINAL WISEMAN say to this rash act of MR. BowrºR's f
Something, perhaps, to the same effect as what he himself said the
other day, about this same Concordat, from his pulpit; to wit:-
“The document in question came first to this country from the correspondent of a
Newspaper, who showed in the remarks with which he accompanied it, that he did not
know the meaning of the words used in it. It was drawn up in the peculiar language
of Catholic ecclesiastical diplomacy—that was to say, the words used in it had a different
meaning from that of ordinary Latin, in which it was written, and it required a person
versed in ecclesiastical Latin and in the principles of the Canon Law to understand it
and interpret its reaning and signification.”
Thus, by the statement of CARDINAL WISEMAN, ecclesiastical Latin
is not plain Latin, and, in like manner, MR. Bowy ER's English may not
be plain English. We are to conclude, that neither MR. Bowy ER nor
the Pope say what they mean. To characterise this peculiarity of
expression, #. dictionary of DR. JoHNSox supplies a pithy term,
consisting of one syllable in three letters, whereby, also the Doctor, in
common conversation, was accustomed to designate that peculiar
liberty taken with º: -
So then, it seems, the Pope, and CARDINAL WISEMAN are misunder-
stood, by reason of º supposed to mean what they say; and }.
adventure, the same misfortune may have befallen MR. Bowyer. But
why cannot they, preaching or penning documents, which will appear
in partibus infideliºn, vouchsafe to accommodate their style to the idiom
of the natives, and say what they mean?... When CARDINAL WISEMAN
talked of governing $ii. and the adjoining counties, he Qught not
to have been surprised at being taken at his word. ... A few foot-
notes, even so monosyllabic as “Bosh,” or “Fudge,” subjoined to the
MR. |tremendous passages in his pastoral, would have forestalled alarm. So
of the Porz. If his Holiness would only notify, that everything, in
his Allocutions *; savouring of intolerance was mere papalrho:
domontade—all the Popº's eye—much unnecessary excitement would
be obviated. ... The Holy #. should advertise us that those
thundering Allocutions of his are, in so far, addressed ostensibly to the
Secret Consistory; but, in reality, to BUNCOMBE. - -
The Cardinal declaims horribly about the eruptions of certain

Protestant volcanoes, in the fires of which a plain impartial reader might
infer, from the #. language of his #: that sundry Roman
Catholic martyrs had been burnt alive. But wh blow up those burning
mountains needlessly by inflated bombast? by does he bellow like
a mad bull to enunciate sentiments which, he would express with
accuracy by roaring as gently as any sucking-dove? -
If we are to j CARDINAL WISEMAN's explanations—but who
knows in what sense he is to understand them?--a new etymology
must be assigned to the word Romance, which it will be reasonable to
consider derived from Reme, regarded as the Papal See... -
In short, the peculiarities of Roman Catholic ecclesiastical diplomacy
and eloquence, by the Cardinal's º: and by his example, are
.. as so many instances of bold hyperbole, flights of the arrows
of an inordinately long bow, very far overshooting the mark of veracity.
Now, then, does not CARDINAL WISEMAN appear to swim up stream
at the same rate, in a similar form, and to the same deplorable purpose,
with MR. Bowyer P His Eminence will, not complain of the implied
analogy when, in venturing to suggest it, we respectfully remonstrate
with #m. for casting his pearls of exaggeration before us poor literal
swine.
THE KING WHO HAS LOST HIS LOWING-CUP.
r
CERTAIN ignoble sovereign, who
shall be nameless, by this time
has probably seen reason to regret
the mean and shuffling policy
which he has pursued with respect
to the contest between Russia and
the Western Powers. Afraid even
to *: out, and declare which
side he believes to be in the wrong,
he must be sensible of being a
conspicuous object of that ...;
with which ind in gener
regard a person equally destitute
of moral courage and moral sense.
He must have at least discovered
that his “silence” has been an
“error;” must have found out
the mistake of having basely held
his, tongue. How, sadly, vexed
with himself for the paltry, and
unprincipled conduct which he
has pursued, if not ashamed of
himself also, will he be, when he
comes to read the account of the
reception experienced by the gal-
lant KING of SARDINIA on his
visit to the City! . It cannot but
occur to him, that if he likewise
had acted as an honourable man
and a constitutional King, he might also, if he had ghosen, have taken
his turn to ride, the hero of a triumphal procession, to Guildhall-saluted
by the acclamations of a free and generous British public. He must
think with what transport he would have beheld in §§ shop-window
along his line of progress, and not only in that of 85, Fleet Street, a
rtrait of himself, crowned with vine-leaves and º of myrtle.
#. in deplori what he will see that he has lost by his
mousness, he will probably be affected by nothing more bitterly than
by the followin passage in a contemporary’s account of the banquet
%. the LoRD MAYoR regaled WICTOR EMMANUEL:-
“The age and quality of the wines used on this occasion was much vaunted. A
sherry, said to be 80 years old, and a bottle of which placed before the King was known
to have been in the Victory at the Battle of Trafalgar; champagne of 1834; hock from
the Steinberg cabinet; and a wine which HoRACE celebrates were among the bonne-
bouches supplied to the Royal table.”
Just let, the nameless, but not, we trust, shameless, monarch fancy
that! Only let him think of the octogenarian sherry! But, above
all, of the champagne of 1834—without doubt) it was some of his
favourite widow’s I Let him imagine, how copiously he might haye
uaffed the Steinberg, and how he might have imbibed the classical
alernian and quoted HoRACE, in any quantity! -
His Majesty will sorrowfully discern that he has missed a good
thing-has, to use ayulgar, but perhaps not inappropriate expression,
missed his tip, in missing the above-named liquors. only consor
lation can be, that if he had stood forward, and behaved honestly and
firmly in the first instance, it is very probable that there would have
been no war-no Guildhaſ feasts for oyal monarchs-no effusion of
Amontillado, Clicquot, Steinberg, or Falernian, in honour of them;
and—no effusion of blood.

JOHN BULL TO JONATHAN.
IT strikes me, brother JonATHAN, we both have cause for blushing;
You for being one moment nose-led by MISTER CALEB Cushing,
I for e'er allowing Consul, Musquito KING, or CRAMPTON,
To have tamper'd with your laws, or your soft corns to have
stamp'd on.
We're tiºn; we're working-men; we’re customers; we’re
rothers;
Though we overlook'd the fact in the days of our grandmothers;
Heavily we paid for it, in debt and in disaster:
While ; #. wounds and raws for which Time scarce has yet found
plaister.
I’ve been turning up our history, how our Third GeoRGE's crown's
en
Was nearly ". about by unlucky MR. TownshenD,
When by his resolutions he affirm'd our right of taxing you;
Or, in other words, of taking your money without axing you.
We imposed—you resisted impositiou. I'd have done
The self-same thing, if my name had been JonATHAN, not John;
You met us both by land and sea—lick'd us both on one and t'other;
In short I fail'd in my attempt to whop my little brother.
Again, in eighteen-twelve, the right of search caused mystic huffs,
And mutual rows, that drove us, a second time, to fisticuffs.
There was the usual amount of being thrash'd, and thrashing done;
Your º: metall'd) ships took ours; we (more shame for us!) burnt
ashington.
When these unlucky tussles grew—the first as well as second—
Kings and Lords were all-in-all with us; the people was not reckon'd.
To maintain that for a colony leading-strings aren't always seasonable,
Or that Trade could e'er be free, was held Utopian, if not treasonable.
When that first war broke out, GEORGE THE THIRD was on the throne;
The second found the ent there—blind sire and bloated son.
The first had his LoRD NonTH; the second, for our woe,
Had his LIVERPool, and SIDMoUTH and CASTLEREAGH and Co.
Free .# was not; Free Press was not; free speech, free thought were
No wires electric girt the earth, no steam the ocean spann'd.
The nations sat apart, or only met as foes;
While kings and courts and cabinets hounded them on to blows.
All this is changed; link'd hand and heart—link'd pocket, too, to fººt.
When JonATHAN goes bankrupt, John may think about his docket.
The nations speak: If President or Premier storms or truckles,
The nation's hands are free, to come down on either's knuckles.
Then, JonATHAN, you keep an eye on Cushing, PIERCE, and MARCEy,
And fºlitake care my Cabinet plays no pranks and isn't sarcy;
And that all alarm of quarrel between you and me may cease,
We’ll bind over both our Governments to keep the (nations') peace.
Very Brave—when not Exposed.
THE conversation was running the other evening upon the Russians
£ing by universal consent “the best soldiers in the world behind for-
tifications,” when young BUMPTIous, who iº, erhaps, the greatest
coward living (out of Belgium), exclaimed, W. do you know, I
think I should be extremely brave if I were behind a good thick wall,
where there was no chance of being hit, and with a jolly bomb-proof
casemate behind, where one could run into in the event of any danger.
I do believe I should distinguish myself, by some wonderful act of
bravery, if I could only convince myself there was not the slightest
occasion to be alarmed !”

To John BRIGHT.
FRIEND BRIGHT,
Thou art an eminent member of the Society of
Friends, whereof, I believe, sundry other eminent members
are also eminent corn-dealers. I suppose thou art intimate
with a sufficient number of those other eminent friends of
º to answer me a question which I would fain ask
of thee.
I wish to know of thee, whether the present high price
of corn has not been occasioned by the wilful contrivance
of thine eminent friends the corn-dealers, with the view of
engendering among the people an impatience of the present
War with Russia?
That thou and the rest of the Friends constituting thy
Society are opposed to the War, I do not wonder. In being
so, you are only consistent with your creed. But thou dost
not seek, or at least thou seekest in a very small measure,
to dissuade us from prosecuting the War on religious
grounds. Thou dost not so much denounce perseverance
in the War as dangerous to our souls as thou representest
it to us as perilous to our pockets. I surmise that thou
expressest the feelings of thy Society, and, if thou dost, it
seemeth to me very probable that they would be naturally
glad to do anything in their power to cause the pressure of
the War to be felt by the country.
Moreover, I perceive that thou, and others of thy way
of thinking, do not content yourselves with deprecating our
endeavours against the Russians. Ye also show an evident
bias towards, and leaning in favour of, those same Russians;
wherefore men cannot but shrewdly suspect that ye are, for
reasons best known to yourselves, interested in their behalf.
When, therefore, thou next makest a speech or writest
a public letter, take iſ beseech thee, the opportunity of
replying to that ittle question which I have above pro-
pounded to thee. -
If thou dost not give a satisfactory reply to it, I think

dearness of bread, and who are persuaded that the high

A POOR HUSBAND ON BONNETS.
"THE expense of a new Bonnet does not stop with the purchase. I
only wish it did...The worst is, when your wife has got a new Bonnet,
she must go to this place and that place for the purpose of showing it.
The new Bonnet of itself is but a small matter, but it is the constant
£xhibition of it afterwards that inflicts the injury on a husband's pocket.
I should like there to be some simple cheap remedy for the º: I
wonder that ladies, when they wish their friends and all the world
to know that they have recently come into the possession of a new
chapeak, do not, instead of publishing the fact on their persons, resort
to the far easier and cheaper plan of advertising it in the Newspapers-
somewhat in the following style:–
This IS TO GIVE NOTICE, that I have, within the last two days,
purchased a new Bonnet, which is the prettiest little duck of a thing that was
•ver sººn.,.It was bºught of MAPAMR CLAAA Nouvsaurs, de Paris, and cost £4.15s, if it
cost a farthing; as the receipt that I have at home in my desk can testify. I may as
well state that it is a love of a drawn bonnet, or, in other words, a little capote d'hiver.
The crown, which is of the richest plum-coloured satin, is crossed and crossº (like the
bars you see on the jam tarts) with tiny bandeauz of velvet (the very best Genoa), of a
warm damson colour. Round the edges run small plumes of feathers of a nice jelly
nuance, and inside are puffs of white blonde (French), that look for all the world like a
cluster of snowballs in danger of being melted by the warmth of the colours above.
The ribbons are chocolate au lait. To sum up, the bonnet falls off the head, reclining
languishingly on the shoulders, as though it were too weak, poor thing, to hold itself up,
and was going off in a kind of fashionable swoon. In one word, it is so light, so pretty,
59 ravissant, and such a perfect dear, that Eugºnis herself could not help being jealous,
if she were to see it. owever, I shall wear it next Sunday in church, so that all my
friends will have a charming opportunity of judging of the effect, which is as delightful
as it is distingué.

"Occasionally, when the fair correspondents were afraid to trust
themselves to their powers of description, engravings might accompany
the advertisements, whilst coloured portraits could be given, not only
of the bomets, but of the lovely wearers themselves, in the Follet,
Petite Couriers, and other soft-minded Magazines that devote their
paint-brushes every month to the illustration of the Fashions. I am
ºure my plan would be the saving to husbands of a deal of expense,
time, and annoyance.”

A Heavy Blow for the Light Bonnet.
AMONG the latest Parisian novelties in dress is an article called a
Caspiato, or Folding Bonnet; which, we are told, will go into a box
measuring two inches. The only difficulty we see about folding a
fashionable bonnet is, that there is really nothing to ſold; and, there-
fore, to wrap up a bonnet for the purpose of diminishing its bulk, is
º: doubling up a fourpenny-bit, in order to reduce its size, or
making two bites at a cherry. Perhaps, however, the Folding Bonnet

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH AT HOME.
THE ENEMY AT BERLIN.
To the Right Honourable the LoRD MAYor. SALOMons.
MY DEAR LoRD MAYor,
YoUR Government—the Municipal Government of the City of
London—is the envy of surrounding nations. The respect which they
entertain for it is immense. They consider the LoRD MAYOR to be the
reatest institution in the world. If any of them ever again try a new
É. I am convinced that it will be modelled on that of the
Corporation of London. A Common Council of citizens; a number of
Aldermen eligible to the Mayoralty in turn, a Chief Magistrate or
LoRD MAYon to be elected out of these annually, when his turn comes,
but liable to be passed over if unfit for his dignity, and to hold office
for twelve months only, which will give them a sufficiently frequent
opportunity of gratifying their love of political change without actual
revolution and bloodshed—I am quite sure that this is the system to
suit the prevalent complaint of the European peoples.
Now, my Lord, read this:—
* Yesterday the house of MENDElssohn here opened a subscription for a new
Russian Five-per-Cent. Loan at 86, with but little success."
The above is an electro-telegraphic communication despatched to
the Times from Berlin. Your Lordship knows that the MENDElssohns
are members of the same community as that to which you are yourself
an ornament. I need not say, if they have taken this Russian loan,
that they are a disgrace to it. You are well aware that the Czar has
ordered a conscription of the Jews, and is driving them to fight, by the
stick and the knout, under the auspices of wooden and painted idols,
for the purposes of his own pride, rapacity, and aggrandisement,
under the pretence of fighting for Christianity. Every shekel, every
sixpence, subscribed to this loan is a contribution towards driving
Hebrews as sheep to the slaughter; a means of causing RACHEL to
weep for her children. If the MENDELssohns have been guilty of
this atrocity, have their brethren no power to make them repent it?
If they have done this thing, are they not dogs? I beg pardon of that
faithful animal the dog—and have you no tin-kettles which you can,
among you, contrive to tie to these dogs' tails? Can you not combine
to avenge on their villanous heads this sacrifice of their kindred to the
Golden Calf and to Moloch? And with the influence which you, as
LoRD Maron of London, must possess among the Israelites, is it not
in your power to set the movement against these rascals, which I
* on foot * -- -
"he flectric Telegraph sometimes tells fibs, but if it shall have
proved veracious in this instance, I respectfully invoke the indignation
and the power of your Lordship against a firm who, in that case, are
the accomplices of the great Russian felon, and you are well aware,
as a magistrate, that the accessory is as bad as the principal. If they
have done this wickedness, my Lord, stir up your people, I say, against
these traitors, these abettors of robbery and murder, these greatest
unhanged blackguards in Christendom, Heathendom, or Jewry.
Monarch of the City, I have the honour to be
Your faithful Subject,

WHAT GENTLEMEN OUGHT TO DO.
AdventisBRs seem to have very odd notions of the duties and obliga-
tions of gentlemen. We have been told of all sorts of things that
“every gentleman ought” to do, or to buy, or to suffer, and we are
convinced that if we were to endeavour to construct a guide to gentle-
manly conduct from the advertising columns of the papers, we should
find that unless a man is either bruising his oats, having his hair dyed,
purchasing a º dining at a particularly cheap eating-house,
or purchasing a real head of false hair, he can be no ... Some
times we are told that “No gentleman should be without” some pecu-
liar kind of tooth-brush, or shirt, or shaving soap, and we are led to
draw the inference that our social rank is regulated by the contents of
our carpet-bag, or the fittings of our washhand-stand.
One of the latest and most extraordinary rules for the conduct of a
gentleman that was ever promulgated, is a sort of moral law, laid down
in an advertisement, that “gentlemen should see their linen dressed
with the starch” sold at a particular establishment. How they are
to "see their linen dressed,” unless they attend at the residence of
their washerwomen, is a question we cannot solve. Nor do we under-
stand how they can be sure of the employment of the right sort of
starch unless they either purchase it themselves, or go with the laun-
dress when she lays in her stock for washing day.
At an extensive Laundry, º regulations would be necessary to
prevent confusion during the ceremony of the starching of eve
gentleman's linen in the gentleman's presence; for as it is a mo
obligation on his part to see it done, there must be no compromise of
principle, no doing the thing by proxy, no appointment of a deputy,
but a bond fide conscientious supervision of the starching process by
the owner of every separate article. In the height, of tº: London
season the doors of the West End blanchisseuses would be besieged by
the noble and the gentle, all jostling each other for priority of admit-
tance: and it would be necessary to make such arrangements as would
prevent too great a rush, by setting aside one morning for Shirt Fronts,
and appointing—after the custom of the Court—a day now and then as
“a Collar Day.” We confess that after weighing the advantages and
disadvantages of the plan, we have come to the conclusion, that the
advertiser is wrong, and that gentlemen, should not see their linen
dressed with starch from his establishment.
LULLABY BY A SOLDIER'S NURSE.

Thou must not, thou canst not, be suffer'd to fight;

It is intended to give a dinner to SIR. B. HALL, to celebrate the
passing of the Act for the local management of the Metropolis. We
are quite ready to admit that the honourable Member has earned a
dinner by what he has º done; but we confidently expect that he
will yet do much more, and that he will prove himself still the B. HALL,
though far from the End all of his career of usefulness.

BUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. .
A NEW IDEA OF HAPPINESS.
We all know that “what is one man's meat is another man's poison.”
We recollect the fabulous illustration of, that which is sport to one
being possibly death to others; but we have been taught for the first
time within these few days, that drunkenness may be a source of
domestic felicity. There is certainly, no accounting for tastes; and,
perhaps, the taste indicated in the following announcement, is one of
the most unaccountable that anybody was ever known to manifest:-
A FAMILY .# in the country will be happy to TAKE CHARGE
of a LADY or GENTLEMAN addicted to INTEMPERANCE. Apply H.M., &c.
The “Family” here alluded to must really be a strangely regulated
family, when it publicly proclaims that, the addition of a drunken lady
or gentleman to its circle will constitute its happiness. We cannot
conceive the possibility of any wholesome pleasure being derived from
seeing a fellow-greature reeling about one's house, in a state, of in-
toxication which is usually regarded as disgusting, but which is
evidently conducive to the happiness of this family, which is so eager
to obtain a drunkard as an inmate. -
We should really like to know the sort of happiness the “Family.”
can expect to derive from “the charge of a lady or #. addicted
to intemperance.” Does the “Family” wish for the excitement con-
sequent on the companionship, of one who gets habitually “roaring
drunk;” or will the “Family” be satisfied with the calmer, pleasure
of contemplating a human being, in a state known among the police
as “ and incapable.”
Is the drunken inmate expected to be always drunk, as his or her
part of the bargain which the family is prepared to enter into with a
view to its happiness? If the family is never happy without the ;
of a drunkard, we recommend that every male member of the family
should join the Police Force
combined; for º,
obligation, instead of
and thus duty and pleasure would be
a drunkard in charge, would be imposed as an
aving to be advertised for as a privilege.

“ URGENT PRIVATE AFFAIRS.”
BROWN, JONES, and RoBINson, three gallant fellows
As ever held HER MAJESTY's commission,
Through perils vast and various as Othello's,
Served the campaign out, each with his division:
Contentedly eat ration beefs and muttons,
Contentedly drank ration rums-and-waters,
Darn'd their own socks, and sew'd on their own buttons,
And fried in summer, froze in winter quarters.
Each at home might be something of a dandy,
Swell at “the Rag,” or Ladies'-man in garrison;
But, by Crimean needs and knocks made handy,
Each had §. his old self past comparison.
Besmirched with summer's suns and winter's drenches,
Their smooth and shaven cheeks now bronzed and bushy 'uns,
At Alma, Inkermann, and in the trenches
Bearded themselves, they bearded the Russians.
Each of the three had fairly earn’d his winter rest,
(Provided Duty was not too emergent,)
But only RoRINson, at home, had interest,
So his “private affairs” alone were “urgent.”
The friends of BRowN and Jones made vain objections,
They had affairs as urgent quite as RoRINson’s ;
But urgency with youths of good connections, , .
Is none with your mere cotton-twist-and-bobbin's sons.
BROWN and Jones stay’d; while Robinson more lucky,
For Malta by the earliest steamer started
To grudge their friend's luck, Brown and Jones too plucky,
Wish’d him “no end of luck” as he departed.
To home and Christmas fare, and fostering beauty
He went, while BRQWN and Jones screw’d up their patience,
To bare hut-life, and dreary routine-duty,
Dog-hunts, vingt-un, short pipes, rum-punch and rations.
Last night on CAPTAIN ROBINson I stumbled,
In clover, after a Belgravian dinner;
How BRowN and Jones had sigh’d—I don't say “grumbled”—
To see their comrade, then, Fthe happy sinner!
There the young hero sat, amidst a bevy
Offair elgravianº cluster'd three deep round him:
While his war-medall'd highness held his levée,
There was no chance for us black-coats, confound him
Not the least chance for us, smooth, smug, civilians,
Against his sun-brown'd cheek, and beard so martial;
Swells, poets, acred men, and men of millions,
Had such been there, had met with nub impartial.
Those girls had ears and eyes but for the Captain,
For him the rogues put on their daintiest graces;
His tales of breach and field their hearts were raptin,
As round him paled and flush'd their pretty faces.
And once, I thought to go up straight, and shame him,
Comrades, and camp and hardship for forsaking.
But then I felt I couldn't fairly blame him,
For the immense sensation he was making.
Under Crimean huts, snow, sludge and dirtin,
BRQWN and Jones grudged not ROBINson's enjoyment,
And RoPINsoN wish'd BRowN and Jones, I'm certain,
Could be employ'd in just his own employment.
'Tis easy for us, in our fireside leisures
Of our young soldiers to be harshest judges.
Angry, if, fighting o'er, they seek home-pleasures,-
Pleasures which no less lucky comrade grudges.
To happy RoPINSON let us be ſenient,
Nor sneer his Christmas mirth to melancholy;
But rather let us wish it were convenient .
That every BRowN and Jones could be as jolly.

THE TOY OF THE FIELD-MARSHAL’S CHILD.
Translated from the original German of an Illustrious Personage, by
PROFESSOR PUNCH, of Fleet Street.
It is the Royal Castle—a castle high and strong
The Walk by which §: may approach is more than three miles long;
The Railroad's much your better way, the Staines and Datchet one,
For then you’re at the Castle gate before your day's half gone.
'Tis the Field-Marshal's daughter—of daughters he hath four–
In childish mirth she wanders near her father's armoury door,
And peeping in, her sweet blue eyes are lighted with a glow
To see his implements of war that make so fair a show.
In a more splendid Uniform no soldier e'er hath sat,
More curious forms were ne'er combined than make that wondrous Hat,
And there is that he never yet has fail'd to draw, at beck—
A sword P. There is a sword, no doubt, but she beholds a Cheque.
And on a crimson cushion lies a polish'd ivory stick,
Some two feet long, in velvet clad, with rich embroidery thick:
A Bâton, such as Kings bestow when the red fight is done,
And heroes take the guerdon for a kingdom saved or won.
"Oh, pretty º cries the child, “I’ll walk thee off with me,
My ſºily will be very glad the lovely thing to see.”
So in her dainty pinafore she gently wrapp'd the prize,
And to the nursery tripp'd away with gladness in her eyes.
She hastes with §: steps and swift (we know what children are),
And pass'd her father's study, and the door it was ajar,
There sat the bold Field-Marshal, at a costly BROADwóoD's Grand,
And with a skilful touch he playå “The German's Waterland.”
She caught his eye, and caught his smile—he cried, “Come hither, Miss;
Passing papa's own door, and never stopping for a kiss?”
SMALL BY DEGREES, AND BEAUTIFULLY LESS.
Shopman. “Oh, I BEG Your PARDON, SIR-BUT THE LADY LEFT HER PARAsole on THE CountER!”
Swell. “HAw! YA—As—No! THAT Is, IT’s My UMBRELLAw. THANKs | By Jove | HAw !”
“O father, dearest father, what a plaything I have found;
Our Christmas tree won’t hold one half so lovely, I’ll be bound.”
The Marshal laugh'd, and touch'd the keys, and play’d a minor mild,
Then, turning to the little one, he ask'd the happy child,
“What hast thou found that mak’st thy heart so overflow with glee,
Thou really look'st as pleased as Punch; come, open, let us see.”
She oped her pinafore, and look’d quite slily, you may deem,
And started from his outstretch'd hand, with a merry little scream;
But when she placed before his sight the new-found pretty toy,
She clasp'd her hands, and cried aloud, and danced for very joy.
But the Marshal look’d quite seriously, and shaking slow his head, .
“What hast thou brought me here, my girl? This is no toy,” he said:
“Go, take it to . room again, and put it down below,
The Bâton is no plaything, child, how could you think it so?
It forms no mean addition to one's prizes, little fay, -
To the Consort's rank, and Colonel's, and their very º: pay;
It sets one's name where WELLINGTON's, and NEy's, and BLUCHER's are

be used in its place. We have come to this conclusion, after reading
the proceedings the other day at the Court of Common Council, when
Deputy PEAGOCK, who will by some persons be regarded as a stranſ
bird, resigned a post of honour, or, to speak atively, voluntarily
shed his tail. Declining to accept the office of Member of the Metro-
litan Board of Works, Deputy PEAcock proposed the election of
[R. T. H. HALL, and that gentleman was accordingly invested with
*:::::::feathers, of which we hope the new wearer will have reason
proud.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN APPEAL FROM SMALL TYPE TO CAPITAL.
WHAT SHALL I po witH My Money? is a question propounded
daily in the advertisements by a financial author, who professes to
solve it for those whomsoever it may perplex. We have not read this
gentleman's book, but we presume it is intended for the instruction of
those who have not too much money, want to make the most of it by
the safest investment, and do not know how. Perhaps he has not
thought it necessary to afford an answer to his question for that not
very small class of persons who have more money than they know
what to do with. For the class is not small. Look on all sides of you;
see how many people are throwing money away: all these belong to it.
Fancy, for instance, a thousand fellows in one night, or more, paying
half-a-guinea for the privilege of dancing under, a glare of gas, in an
unwholesome atmosphere, tawdry disguises, and disgraceful company.
Fancy people, in greater numbers collectively, dancing about, in better
company, for the greater part, perhaps, here and there, at this and that
distinguished mansion, in the midst of hundreds, nay thousands of
pounds’ worth of drapery, and crystalline or metallic trinkets. Fancy
people still more numerous, shooting their money in the form of liquid
and solid superfluities; that is to say, rubbish; into their own stomachs:
the very worst imaginable places they could possibly choose for shoot-
ing rubbish in; Fancy people more than sufficiently numerous, and
most highly select, so overburdened with money as to have, not only
one sixpence, but forty, fifty, or sixty thousand times that sum to
hazard on the comparative speed of a quadruped. The existing state
of society verifies all these fancies, and more, apparently as absurd,
and presents so many instances of people who are so wealthy that they
know not what to do with their money. Rather, however, than throw
it away, they might at least do one thing, presently to be mentioned.
Consider what armies of unnecessarily embroidered, illuminated,
variegated footmen are kept by the sumptuous and festive classes. If
all these domestics were to be put into reasonable breeches, and other-
wise attired at the same rate, how many poor unable-bodied persons
might be maintained on the difference of expense?
By retrenchment in plush, merely, it is very? probable that the
number of necessitous and helpless people, whom it would be possible
to support, would considerably exceed Twenty-Four.
Now that is, the number of superannuated worthy persons, useful in
their time, whom it is the present §. of the PRINTERs' ALMs-
Houses Fun D, to accommodate. Their design is near completion; the
houses have been built, in a pleasant and healthy place at Wood Green,
Hornsey, and º are making to elect inmates in May; but
to complete these, by enclosing and laying out the ground, there is
need of £250.
The workmen in the printing business have contributed a consider-
able portion of the º which has been laid out in getting thus far
with their Almshouses, and surely they have a right to expect that the
; and friends of the Press will help them out with the remainder
needful.
The friends of the Press are every constitutional person who can
read; its patrons everybody who is able to patronise anything: and
though the Press occupies a proud position, it will be seen on refer-
ence to the PRINTERs ALMsHoush FUND Šubscription List, that the
Fund is not so proud but that it will be thankful to receive the smallest
contribution.
THE AUTHORS OF WAR AND THEIR WORKS.
THE crippled heroes at Chatham have received no small, consolation
for the loss of their limbs: that is, as much as the QUEEN herself could
afford them. HER MAJESTY visited the sick and wounded in the
military hospital of that place lately. Among the gallant sufferers,
says the Times' reporter—
“Another special object of Royal sympathy was Robert CLINToN, 88th Regiment,
only nineteen years old, who lost both eyes in the attack on the Quarry Pits. After
being engaged an hour, a ball entered one eye, passed under the bridge of the nose, and
out at the other eye, entirely depriving him of sight.”
Thus does War tear out human eyes—yet monsters, who involve
mankind in this misery, die with their own eyeballs glaring whole in
their sockets!
Read on :-
“The case of Thomas Doroghan, 14th Regiment, twenty years old, was also pointed
out. While ...; in the trenches he received a ball through the upper lip,
which, after carrying away all the teeth on one side of the upper jaw, broke the lower
one so completely as to be wedged into the fracture. It had to be pulled out by
forceps.”
Here is another small fraction of the vast sum of human agony and
wretchedness meant by War, But brutes that are the wilful cause of
such an atrocity expire with their fangs entire in their unbroken jaws.
Bear with one more horror:-
“Another most extraordinary case was that of WILLIAM ClaRKE, of the 88th
ball which entered the right side of the nose, passed completely through the palate of
the º fracturing both upper and lower jaw, and y passed out at the back of
his neck.”
No retributive bullet, however, smashed the nose and mouth of the
tyrant who set balls flying by thousands,and tens of thousands. The
wretch departed this life grinning with all his teeth. -
He departed this life—and what then? ... Well; that is for the
demons to consider who initiate these horrors in the holiest name, with
psalms in their mouths, crosses in their gripe,and tongues in their cheeks.
But we are not to use such language as this in talking about Princes.
It is “bad taste.” They are “august personages,” and “it is wrong
of us to speak evil of our enemies.”. Yes, you canting noodles; but it
is not wrong to express loathing and detestation of the enemies of our
common race. It is not wrong to execrate the memory of GREENACRE;
there is one sufficient reason why it, is not: there are, perhaps, a
million of reasons as strong, many of them stronger, for execrating the
memory of the EMPEROR NICHOLAs, and for doing all that poor .
and ink can do to rouse the wrath of mankind against the fellow who has
succeeded him, and whose avowed intention is to act out his father's
crime. De mortuis nil nisi bonum. Yes, indeed. Add no epitaph to
the roses on NERo's tomb; record nothing of JUDAs IscARIOT except
that he was an Apostle ! § Think of the torn-out eyes, the shat-
tered jawſ, for which the world is indebted to your “august, person-
ages.” Bah!, Pursue such curses of the earth as wild beasts while
living ; hang them up for scarecrows when dead.
THE HERO OF A HUNDRED FEASTS.
HE electors of Southwark are con-
tinuing to give dinners to SIR
Charles NAPIER. This is all very
well. They consider him an ill-used
old boy (though a little unruly), and
are resolved to make all amends to
him. As Christmas approaches, we
i. to have at least a hundred
bullocks roasted in his honour through-
out the borough of Southwark, with
some fifty pair of blankets, duly em-
broidered by the wives and daughters
of the constituency, duly presented to
him. Every feast is only another bit
of training of the old sailor, that he
may go in, and do fight with SIR
JAMEs GRAHAM ; at present, from
sheer apprehension, it is said, reduced
to a gruel diet at Netherby. We
only hope that SIR CHARLEs will not make too much preparation;
will not allow himself to be over-trained. Let SIR CHARLEs bear in
memory the story of a Dutchman, who, resolving to lº over a
ditch, took so long a run, that when he arrived at the brink, he
was fairly out of breath; and was thereupon compelled to sit himself
down, the jump unjumped! We therefore hope that, with, all this
É. feasting and promising, SIR CHARLEs will take good
eed to husband his wind.
A LEARNED FLY.
WE have read somewhere of a saint, who had trained a favourite fly
with so much success, that the insect performed with perfect, accurac
the functions of a bookmarker. "This sagacious creature, it is alleged,
was in the habit of attending on its master during his studies, for the
purpose of following him in their track, and !". up at any point
where the eye of the Priest left the page it had been resting on. We
should have thought that there might have been danger of the insect's
falling asleep on his post, in consequence of the dulness of the work, or
being prevented from proceeding by the state of the roads, for those of
learning are sometimes remarkably heavy. -
We doubt whether the practice of using a fly as a book-marker will
ever become general; but if it should prevail to any extent, the ſol-
lowing Literary Police Regulations might be found convenient.
Every Fly to pull up with his head towards the next paragraph.
No Fly will be permitted to leave the line until he is ready to pro-
ceed to another line, where he is to remain till ordered off in the
regular manner. - -
Svery Fly found blocking up any passage, will be liable to be
removed immediately.
No Fly to stand across any column, or at the entrance of any Royal
road to learning on any pretence whatever.

A REAL BLESSING TO EVERYBODY.
The #º. are making a great effort to turn Saturday
into a half-holiday for themselves, and we are sure that
everybody will second such a very salutary movement. If
the Lawyers can be got to abstain from work for, only half
a day in the week, an immense amount of mischief must
necessarily be prevented. There is something quite refresh-
ing in the notion that one-twelfth of the time devoted to
the horrors of law may be henceforth rescued from their
present frightful use, and that the Lawyers may, for six
hours in the week, be engaged in some humanising occu-
aſſions. "We shall hail the establishment of a half holiday
or Lawyers as one of the greatest boons that can be con-
ferred on society. -
That the proposition should have come from themselves is
more than we should have anticipated, though in the present
philanthropic age we might have expected some friend of the
human race to have º: that the Lawyers should
be made to cease from their professional pursuits at least
once a-week for the good of the public in general. We
greet the step on the part of the Lawyers as a good omen;
for when conscience is once awakened, there is no knowing
the extent of its beneficial influence.

THE ORDER OF THE CHIMNEY-POT.
We have recently been enlightened as to the existence of an officer
of the Royal Household whose name we never recollect to have
stumbled over in the pages of the Court Calendar, or in the columns of
the Court Circular. e, however, have much satisfaction in present-
ing to the world, and dragging from the bushel under which his light
has hitherto been hidden, no less a personage than WILson, THE Royal
Swººp, who we are told was “active” the other day in putting out
(or fancying he was putting out), a fire that had broken out (or was
believed to have broken out) in Windsor Castle... We trust that in all
future editions of Royal Red, Blue, or other similar official books, the
name of WILSON, THE ROYAL. Sweer will be assigned its proper place
in the list of the Royal Household. The office may be humble, but it is
undoubtedly very useful, and quite as honourable as those which were
formerly held, and ostentatiously heralded as PURVEYor of Asses'
MILK to THE KING, and Bug DESTRoyER. To THE Roy AL FAMILY.
We confess to some little astonishment that in these days there should
exist such a post as that of Royal Sweep; for we should have rather
expected the functionary in question to have been distinguished as
Royal Ramoneur; but perhaps the #. process is not pºiſ; to
one who has not yet arrived at the dignity of a patent office. If the
Royal Sweep is ambitious, there may be personal reasons for his con-
tin to adhere to the old school of high art with reference to chim-
neys, but we would warn him } the fate of the many historical person-
ages who, especially in the neighbourhood of a Court, have lost their
lives #: bing. Some inconvenience may arise from the prominence
into which Wilson has been brought, for now that the Court News-
man has officially recognised the “Royal Sweep,” we shall be having
claims made by the Royal Dustman, who no doubt thinks himself far
above the common dust, the Royal lheaver, and a variety of other
officials of a similar class, demanding the courtesy of a line in the list of
the Royal Household.
A CHARTERHOUSE CAROL FOR CHRISTMAS.
WE understand that the WERY REVEREND ARCHDEACON HALE is
about to give a great treat to the boys of the Charterhouse at
Christmas. He will sing, or rather execute, a church chaunt, to be
called in some manner after MR. RoBson's Humours of a Country Fair,
the Humours of Five Pluralities. It is our present opinion, that nothing
can surpass the marvellous flexibility of feature, the extraordinary
variety of intonation of the Olympic actor; nevertheless, much is to be
expected of the powers of face of a churchman who, at one time, can
represent five characters. Again, although the actor has doubtless a
deservedly high salary, still, the several pickings amounting to between
£4,000 and £5,000 per annum, must impart to the voice of the church-
man a volume of silveriness to be despaired of by the richest comedian
—out of a pulpit.

trust that if he has a house to sell, he would not think of asking more
than nine years’ purchase for the freehold.

UBLE.
UR poor little Kensington
Railway has got itself
into a sad hobble in a
simple endeavour to
move a few coals,
which came into col-
lision with a goods
train on the Great
Western. The fact
is, that a Railway,
like an individual. can
never be idle without
getting into mischief;
and as there is no
work for the poor
§ little line, it has been
§ playing tricks with
|tº one of its engines,
tº which, ran on the
| ground of one of its
ñº. neighbours.
t is really high time
that our poor little
| Railway should either
have some useful oc-
cupation found for it,
or, be at once abo-
lished; for it seems
hopeless to get up
any traffic between
the desolate Scrubs
of Wormwood, and
the almost equally wild district of Warwick Square. These two localities seem to maintain
a stubborn isolation, notwithstanding their geographical propinquity, and it appears to be as
impossible to cultivate a friendly communication by rail between Wormwood Scrubs and
Warwick Square as to get oil and vinegar to coalesce. We do not mean to depreciate the
capabilities of the poor little line, if it were extended to some points within the pale of
civilisation and beyond the palings of the Square, which enjoys a sad celebrity in the midst of
its solemn seclusion. - -
The onlyW. that is now made, is to carry the º Railway by a bridge across
the Great Western, which seems to be only a new mode of “throwing it over;” a fate which
it has in other ways º; experienced. The real remedy for the misfortunes of the
line, is to give it something to do beyond the mere child's F. to which it has hitherto been
limited; for, a Railway which starts at one end from nothing, and comes to nothing at the
other end, can only have one terminus-and that is, Failure... Even the market gardening
operations, which once cecupied, the painful leisure of the oficials, appear to have come to
a stand; for the rails are no longer fringed with a border of radishes; and the sleepers
no longer sleep in the midst of cabbage-beds. Why not extend the concern, so as to
make it available, as it might be, for very valuable traffic; but at present it serves no other
purpose, than to cause everyone, who has anything to do with it—(though it supplies no
3ommunication)—to be continually troubled with a line.
OUR OWN RAILWAY IN TRO
º
THE CONTAMINATION OF IRON.
It would seem as if the stable was not the only Temple of Dishonesty. At one time,
roguery and horses apparently ran together... No sooner did a man have anything to do
with a horse, than from that moment he was either making for the Old Bailey, or else starting
boldly on the Road to Ruin. But la'ely it would appear as if the four-footed monopoly of
robbery had become forfeited in favour, of railways. , Is there anything immoral in the
touch of iron? Is there, a rust, in the metal that a P. character acquires the
moment he comes in contact with it? And yet we could enumerate the reputations of
certain Railway Kings and other potentates, that have become exceedingly rusty from the
habit of fingering too freely railway iron! We suppose the contamination only follows in
the proper order of things, for, as railways have *. horses, it was but natural that
the roguery of the one should, in time supplant the roguery, that formerly was so closely
connected with the other, And as a steam-engine goes much faster than a racer, it was
only to be expected that railways, in the race of dishonesty, would certainly run con-
siderably a head of horses. Iron has become lately such a suspicious article of commerce,
that it ought decidedly to exclaim to any respectable man who is morally anxious to keep his
fingers clean, “Noli me Tangere!”
Russian Beeswing.
THE EMPEROR of Russia has presented to the Editor of the Northern Bee a snuff-box set
in diamonds. We presume this compliment to the Bee is a .." of the value which
the EMPEROR sets on Buzz. We do no recollect having ever heard, until lately, of the
Northern Bee; but we may be sure that if any Literary Bee is suffered to “live and breathe
and have its Bee-ing” in Russia, the Bee in question must be a very humble one. It would
be it. death to the Bee if it dealt in any other than honeyed words, or dared to turn

This, interesting young lady is, every day,
strengthening her claims upon the admiration
and the sympathy of a most moral and most
thinking British public. Scraps of her hand-
writing, we are told, are anxiously sought for:
and locks of her hair will, no doubt, command
eager buyers. A young, gentleman, who has
just entered upon a fortune of £15,000 per
annum, is said only to await the liberation of the
fair captive from gaol, to offer her his heart and
hand and income. The young lady is, it is
averred, duly aware of the ... that awaits
her; but with a sense, we should rather say with
an under-current, of honour that has glided
through her life, she is first determined to
fulfil a theatrical engagement, into which, on
her final commitment for trial, she entered with
a London manager. FITZBLUNDERBuss

Taming of the Shrew, Act iv. Scene 3.
UNFORTUNATE MR. BARBER,
. It has been said of actors, that “when they do agree, their unanimity
is wonderful;” and it may be also said of the lawyers, that when they do
make up their minds to a piece of purity, their puritanism is quite mar-
wellous. , The case of MR. W. H. BARBER is a case in point; for though
pardoned by the Crown for an offence he is believed to have never com-
mitted, he was for many years refused pardon by all the law courts, for
the sin of having been suspected of that of which the Royal pardon
virtually pronounced him innocent.
We have the fullest sympathy for every effort that can be made to
purge the legal profession of its corruptions, but we cannot approve the
persevering refusal to re-admit MR. BARBER into its ranks, so long, as
those ranks are infested by some of the most obnoxious miscreants that
ever contributed to render an occupation odious. Poor MR. BARBER
seems to have been made the scape-goat for all, the villainy which the
profession of the law is said to contain; and while no steps are taken to
remove from the roll those who are notorious for their mal-practices, an
obstinate determination was evinced to keep of the roll a man against
whom charges had been made, which the Government had negatived by
restoring him to freedom, . His case, however, furnished a very
convenient text upon which purity might be preached, and his
wounds were kept open as a sort of issue, instead of dealing directly
with the numerous sore places and corruptions which the professional
body is burdened with. The Court of Queen's Bench has at length
done a sort of tardy justice, which from the lateness of its arrival
is i." of the Court of Chancery in its old days of slothfulness.
The Judges “could no longer withhold the permission for his
taking his former position as a certificated attorney of that Court,” and
after several years of prohibition, from his professional pursuits, he is
allowed to resume his practice, if he can obtain any, in a ground now
occupied more thickly than ever by active competitors. Of course
compensation is out of the question: and MR, BARBER having already
been once transported for life and freely pardoned, after undergoing a
portion of a sentence for a crime of which he is virtually declared
innocent, must console himself as well as he can under the reflection,
that he has been improperly debarred from practice if he is now pro-
; admitted. #. however, it will be thought that MR. BARBER
ardly, needs commisération under his unmerited sufferings, on the
ground referred to in the old case of the eels, who, we find in the books,
were “used to it.”
HOW THE NIGHTINGALE WAS NOT CAUGHT.
A TRAP was set for the Swedish Nightingale; a twig was limed; a
pinch of salt was held between thumb and finger for sure yet tender
caption of the bird; that, being caught, was to be coaxed to sing for a
certain purpose, the coaxers fº much praise of worldly worth
or not, as it may be, for skill of bird-catching. The Nightingale was
to sing, for a Nightingale! that was the appointed, settled lesson for
the melodious bird. Somehow it happened that our Nightingale
would not thus be, beguiled or constrained. So she first perched at
Exeter Hall; and there divinely sang, singing as near.'...at Heaven's
ate” as may be permitted to mortal utterance. Well, this being
one, who doubts that the Nightingale of Sweden will, in due time,
sing in affection and reverence of sister NIGHTINGALE of England:
melody of sound doing homage to melody of soul?. Are we to forget
a certain Nightingale wing somewhere in the region of Brompton,
under whose cover the hectic tint of consumption may be deepened into
the ruddiness of assured health Are we to forget the thousand and
thousand Nightingale notes, scattered in Sweden, in England, in the
United States, in Germany, to cheer and solace, the sick, the weak,
and world-weary Therefore, we know that at her own time,
and of her own free emotion, the Nightingale will warble for the
Nightingale.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MORE BRIGHT IDEAS.
CoNSISTENT advo-
cate of peace with
Russia is MR.
BRIGHT. For he
observed in his
speech the other
day at the Mars-
den Mechanics’
Institution:
* what a wonder-
ful thing is one of
these penny News-
papers! It is as well
written and as good
in tone and morals,
as one of the old and
costly papers we have
been accustomed to
see. A steamer comes
in from the United
States, a great ship
from Australia, a
mail from India and
china, despatches and
correspondence from
that unhappy region
where four Christian
nations are engaged in mutual slaughter, messages by telegraph from all, the great
capitals of Europe; all the tidings from all quarters of the Globe are gºhered into
that wonderful sheet, which, for one penny, is placed before you every day."
The gentleman who praises that wonderful sheet, naturally also
sympathises with Russia. Wonderful, indeed, are the contents, of
Mr. BRight's penny sheet. They would be more wonderful, still, if
the vendor of that sheet to MR. BRight had paid for them all. Per-
haps he has, though. Make that reservation. Fº he maintains his
own correspondent at New York, Geelong, Calcutta, Madras, Bombay,
Canton, before Sebastopol, at Constantinople, in Paris, and every
ºther capital in Europe, not excluding St. Petersburg, if he is a
“friend” of MR. BRight's. Perhaps his foreign correspondence is
all original. But, if otherwise, his news are simply prigged; and the
#." of his paper is no better than a receiver of stolen goods. If
R. BRIGHT approves of this man's style of business, he cannot, but
approve likewise of Russian policy; nor ought it to surprise anybody
to learn that he is .."to buy his silk pocket-handkerchiefs, in
the cheapest market, wherever that may be, which has succeeded
Field Lane. -
MR. BRIGHT in the same speech, moreover, exhibited himself as a
consistent professor of the doctrine of non-resistance at large. Against
the national hostility to Russia, he contented himself with preferring
the gentle plea, that Russia is not so barbarous as we generally sup-
pose. ... He based this argument on two notable facts. These facts
were, that Russia had at one extremity of the empire a library con-
taining a great many books: and, at the other, a city containing an im-
mense quantity of corn, MR. BRIGHT ignored, as usual, the real cause
of the anti-Muscovite feeling of the people; namely, their conviction
that the Russian attempt on Turkey was the first move towards the
intended subjugation o º e did not dispute, that point; he
only disputed the assertion that the Russians were barbarians; and
was satisfied to leave unprejudiced minds to draw the conclusion, that
the Russian yoke was not so hard as it was supposed to be; and that,
to take the chance of having to wear it was preferable to fighting, in
order to keep it off.
It is very true that MR. BRIGHT predicts that—
“By-and-by we shall find out that CaRDINAL Wisemax, the French Invasion and
the Russian Emperor may be classed in the same list of imaginary perils.”
MR. BRIGHT should speak for himself and his minority. They may
º at the idea of foreign supremacy; for they would submit to it
with smiles. Concordats and invasions are not imaginary eventualities;
witness Austria and Turkey; though we may, perhaps, find them
imaginary perils, if we persist in not being advised by MR. BRIGHT.

A Frozen-Out Clock.
We have seen with some surprise, but without much º: an
announcement that the clock of St. Paul's had been stopped by the exces-
sive cold. We have no doubt that the case of the clock will occupy the
immediate attention of the City authorities; and, as the cold has had
the effect of stopping the hands, we should not be surprised if the
Corporation should order that the hands be forthwith provided with a
pair of gloves... If a muſt would answer the purpose, perhaps the want
might be supplied by a Common Councilman.

MRS. SWANSDOWN’S WORK-TABLE.
A CONVEYANCING LECTURE FOR THE LADIES.
“Steal, foll the wise convey it call."—Shakspeare.
AND now, my dears, we approach the conclusion of our little illus-
tration of the system which defrauds you all of so much happiness
and comfort. I told you what a pleasant Consultation was held by
the four lawyers, and how agreeably they got on. Two or three other
meetings, of the same kind, took place, and the counsel talked over
some of the points they had ...}. the papers, and left others for
future discussion. In the meantime Mrs. SwansDown's solicitor,
MR. Buster, was not idle, and the costs he was incurring in fulfilling
the demands of the lawyers on the other side were highly pleasing to
him to contemplate, when he made up his “attendance book,” as a
lawyer's waste-book is called, or when he was walking home from
church with Mrs. Buster, after an excellent discourse at St. Pancras
upon the worthlessness of earthly treasures.
Now, as you may like to know the way in which MR. Buster's earthly
treasures were accumulated, I will show you a page or so from the
bill against MRs. Swanspown, which was regularly made up, every
week, by a clerk kept for the purpose of attending to such matters.
I will take out a leaf at random, there are already eighty or ninety
pages of the same kind. Any one is a good specimen.

and therefore the lawyers had no right to complain. By a recent Act, a
convicted thief or other if he can impose upon a §º

was arranging for “further exertions,” three of these Ticket-of-fleave
gentlemen, entered MRs. SwansDown's house, with a false key, one
night, while the family were at the theatre. One man descended into
the kitchen and soothed the servants into silence by means of a loaded
bludgeon and an empty pistol, and the others stripped the house. The
silver-mounted Work-table was too large to carry away; but they
smashed it to pieces with a hammer, and stripped off aſ its orna.

motto with which I have adorned these lectures, you will note that

THE BRITISH MERCHANT PAST AND PRESENT.
THERE was a British Merchant in the jolly times of old,
As some of us, in our young days, by grandfathers were told;
He was a man of ample means and corresponding mould,
Who throve by what he wisely bought and profitably sold.
A spacious beaver hat he had, and powder'd was his hair,
Blue, with brass buttons, was the coat which he was wont to wear;
Encased in a buff waistcoat was his corporation fair,
A chain and seals hung from his fob; his watch he carried there.
A frill'd shirt, ruffles at his wrists, and buckles in his shoes
He wore, and shorts, which calves display’d as solid as his views;
He never ventured more than he was well prepared to lose,
And therefore all who dealt with him were certain of their dues.
He look’d upon his counting-house with pleasure and with pride,
And used to live above it in the precincts of Cheapside;
There Father Thames bore wealth, to him and riches on his tide,
'Twas there the British Merchant lived, and when his time came, died
But now his modern counterfeit is living like a lord,
In some suburban mansion, and a style he can’t afford;
But, being a director of some Company or Board,
By means of peculation he replenishes his hoard.
His business is to make things pleasant, cook accounts, and play
With other people's money and his sacred trust betray,
Until the bubble bursts at length-there comes a crash one day,
And then he’s not forthcoming: for the knave has run away.
If caught, he gets some barrister to undertake his brief,
Who probably will get him off, like many another thief;
And if he should convicted be, although he comes to grief,
The people he has ruin’d still remain without relief.
Oh! for the British Merchant of the former times, that could
Command, in case of exigence, whatever sum he would,
His name was held in such esteem; so high his credit stood,
And nobody required his bond—his word was thought as good.
Oh! for the British Merchant that was wont to s
And jingle pockets full of gold he honestly possess
Whilst sentiments of probity and virtue he express'd,
Where is that British Merchant now? The Law replies Nonest!
And how should things be otherwise when noble Lords we see,
That scorn the honest trader, will, as thick as thieves can be,
Hob-nob with wealthy Railway Kings, though rogues of base degree,
And when their bankers come to break, 'tis no surprise to me.

WANT of MILITARY INTELLIGENCE.-Lord Lucan has received

MAN AND BEAST.
A Society has lately sprung-or, we should rather say, tumbled—
into existence at Paris, whose object is the accomplishment of what
may be called the “disgusting feat” of eating horse-flesh. These in-
dividuals style themselves the “Hippophagic Association;" and the
grand purpose of their lives seems to be, the getting down their throats
as large a quantity of dead horses as possible. If these animals—we
mean the Society, not their food—are allowed to followup their horrible
plº and satiate their appalling appetites, the question may arise,
*Where are we to get our cat's me.” i. the Society to con-
sist of one hundred Members, and each Member were to moderate his
hunger so as to eat only one horse per month, we get the frightful total of
twelve hundred horses annually withdrawn from the stock of the regular
dog's-meat man. It is true that many persons who frequent the cheap
restaurants in Paris, and, perhaps, even the lower order of London pie.
shops, may be acting on hippophagic principles without being aware of
it; º that any human being can calmly sit down to a dinner off dead
horse, is really inconceivable. If there is a body of epicures who have
carried ſº to such a morbid pitch that they cannot eat wholesome
animal food, such as satisfies the rest of the human race, we would
direct their attention to a less valuable beast than the horse; and we
recommend them to that more congenial animal the ass, which would
be very likely to agree with them. It may be said that the arrange-
ment savours somewhat of cannibalism; but, if it should even be the
death of them, it would only make a still further diminution in the
number of donkeys.

SEASONABLE GOOD-HUMOUR.
.ACUTLER, who has the reputation of being rather a sharp blade in
his business, has stuck up in his shop-window—which is not a six-
penny fare from Oxford Street—the following announcement:

We must not forget to mention, that just above the inscription is
suspended a pair of Skates.
Destitution of Brown Bess in Russia.
PERQūssion locks are by no means universal in the Army of the
“first Military Power in Europe;” hence has arisen, on the part of the
Russian troops, a great demand, which it proves difficult to meet, for
flints. Surely, if the heart of the Czań is with his soldiers, the
deficiency might, in some measure, be supplied out of that.

HEAD-QUARTERS OF BULLY BOTTOM
GenTLEMAN named BERINGTON
has invented a new knapsack, the
recommendation of which consists
in its being comfortably adjusted
to the soldier's back, instead of,
like the old one, hampering his
movements and impeding his
respiration. In reference to this
invention, the Times says:
“An overwhelming weight of testimony
in favour of Braington's plan, coming
not only from the soldiers themselves, but
from army surgeons, eminent medical
authorities, and experienced officers, has
hitherto failed to secure its adoption at
the Horse Guards.”
We have been calling “Head
Quarters” the “Horse Guards,”
quite long enough. ... It is high
time that the Authorities of those
Guards exchanged the name of
that noble animal for the desig-
nation of another quadruped, to
which they correspond, in nature and quality, a great deal more closely
than they do to it. Henceforth, unless they show, somewhat like
reason to the contrary, they had better be denominated the Ass Guards.
