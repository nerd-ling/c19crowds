PUNCH's PREFACE.
It is narrated of the philosophic Bayle, that his only relaxation from the severest
studies, was to wrap his cloak around him, and watch the vagaries of PUNCH. Philosophers
have accorded the same homage to ourselves—our weekly show-box is anxiously sought by
all who are unwilling to let their minds moulder; and, amid our own wearying exertions
for our country's good, we derive a priceless consolation from the reflection that myriads
are made wiser and happier for “PUNCH."
Gentle readers—sensible Subscribers—we touch our cap, and honestly and heartily
wish you a merry Christmas—such as we knew of old, when
-
“The damsel donn'd her kirtle sheen,
The hall was dress'd with holly green;
Forth to the wood did merry men go
To gather in the misletoe:
Then open wide the baron's hall
To vassal, tenant, serf, and all;
Power laid his rod of rule aside,
And Ceremony doff d his pride.”
Scott.

UNCH'S PROLOGUE TO HIS THIRD VOLUME,
A Mystic Number, is Number Three
º For are we not told
Ö By Pliny of old
g That three, and but three, were the Sibyllae :
- Three were the books they left behind ;
(A second edition who can find )
Three are the thimbles, and only three,
That have covered the wonderful little pea.
The Poor-law Commissioners are no more ;
Their spell would be broken if they were four ;-
And never again could the poor be fed
On a ha'porth of cheese and a ha'porth of bread.
Fatal that Number has been, for we
Married our wife from Number Three ;
And won't the next year as ever is, be
Eighteen hundred and forty-three ?
Over the paper and on to our quill,
Jumping from table to window sill,
Are two little imps,
As lively as shrimps
Before they are boil’d—Will they never be still
One has settled at last—such a strange little prig–
In a square-cut coat and a full-bottom'd wig,
And under his arm he has placed, ha! haſ
Such a queer little three-corner'd chapeau de bras;
The buckles are silver he wears in his shoes,
Which were made when they used to be square at the toes.
Bless us and save us ! how changed he appears,
His pucker'd-up face seems the text-book of years,
And no one would think that a moment ago,
He was skipping about like Ma'amselle Cerito
With his toes turn'd out as tho' he had stood
In the wooden box,
'Yelept the stocks,
Which is used to turn naughty girls into good;
He hands us a card which we never can hope
To decipher without we’d a microscope ;
But the little sprite
Now does the polite,
And stepping up with a gentle hem 1
Says, “The name you see, belongs to me,
It's Doubleu-i-s—dee—o–m.”
“Wisdom –Are you that hoary sage
Iteally you seem very small for your age.'
Says he,
gº I be,
And I’ve come to assist at ‘Punch, Volume Three.”
And then without pausing a single minute,
He has leap'd to the throttle
Of our little ink-bottle,
And just like a dabchick, has soused himself in it.
Help! help : he will surely be drown'd,
And what will the coroner say when he's found !
We've poked all about with our pen, but O la :
We can fish nothing up but his chapeau de bras I
The other sprite
Doth now alight, |
As though to inquire “What are you at "
O my what a pair of luminous eyes,
We never saw any so bright for their size,
And so wide awake,
O wouldn't they make
Two “Union-pins” for a satin cravat,
With one of the “Albert ties º'
Gingerly over the table he trips,
Swaying his body about from the hips,
As much as to say
If you wish to convey
To the world that you're inade out of porcelain clay,
You'll own that my style is the right time o' day
“I'm Wit,” says he,
“So, Signior P-,
'Twill be rather hard if we cannot agree.
“You’ve occasioned some sport
In my own joyous court,
So I've come to assist in your Volume Three ;
And, to prove my good will,
Let me creep in your quill,
And each word shall sparkle that flows from its tip.
We can surely devise
To be witty and wise,
For Wisdom lies hid in the fount where you dip !”
Presto
Just so—
9r the time was, if anything, shorter—
Yit few to our pen,
And its nib we saw then—
Was a gem of the very first water.
So, tho' wondrous the tomes that we've written may be,
You'll find they’ll be nothing to Volume Three

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ST. PAUL’S AT SEA.
We take the following from The Times:–
“On the passage out in the Acadia, Captain Alexander Ryrie reports that,
on the 16th of May, in latitude 46, longitude 47, there were scen about 100
icebergs, some of them of large size, and one from 400 to 500 feet high, bearing
so strong a resemblance to St. Paul's, that it was at once christened after
that celebrated cathedral. The dome was perfect, and it required no extraor-
dinary stretch of imagination to supply the turrets, pinnacles, and other parts of
the building. But this is not the most extraordinary part of the affair; on the
homeward passage of the Acadia to Liverpool, on the 6th inst., the same object
was seen ; and the immediate exclamation on board was, ' There is our old
friend St. Paul's.” In the interim between the two views, the iceberg had
drifted about 70 miles.”
There is something more than curious in this ice-formed cathedral.
We have little doubt that it is intended as a significant warning to
certain dignitaries of the church—to certain bodies of protesting
Christians. For our part, iceberg as it is, we think it should be im-
mediately dignified by deans, prebends, canons, choir, and all the
other ecclesiastical ornaments to be found in the stone St. Paul's.
We should mightily like to have the appointment of the whole body.
We think we could lay our finger upon a bishop, whose hot political
zeal would be reduced to a very healthful temperature, if submitted
to an ice-pulpit. Then his discourses would have the refreshing
coolness of his own port. Most of us know what hot Bishop is ;
Losing his BALANCE.
therefore, for a trial, we should mightily like to taste the bishop we
could name—well iced.
We know not whether Sir Christopher Wren's Saint Paul's could
spare a few of its body for its glacial counterpart, but we have no
doubt that Sidney Smith can immediately resolve that question. We
think there are many attached to the stone edifice, very much too
warm for zealous churchmen—they would cool down admirably, pre-
ferred to an iceberg. -
As for the congregation, we could ship off thousands who, with lips
of Christian love, have hearts of snowballs—zealous church-goers
who come and go, frozen in their orthodoxy, whose constitutional
piety never rises to blood-heat.
There is, however, one appointment that we insist upon having in
our own gift—it is that of Beadle, which, in the handsomest way, we
shall bestow on Mr. PLUMTREE, whose recent efforts in Parliament to
stop by statute the chirping of sparrows on Sundays, demands the
grateful acknowledgments of the whole Christian world. Neither,
should Sir ANDREw AGNEw apply for the place, do we think we
could find it in our hearts to refuse him the appointment of Pew-
Opener.
We have not entered upon this subject in a thoughtless vein. We
are aware that the frequent cry of “The Church is in danger!" may
be repeated on board the iceberg St. Paul's, the more especially should
it float into a warm latitude. We have heard of the dissolution of
abbeys ; but what a dissolution would there be of the Cathedral, as,
piece by piece, it melted into the relentless waters : We have, how-
ever, provided for the dignitaries and the congregation; nay, the
Beadle and the Pew-Opener shall partake of our benevolence: for,
in the true spirit of philanthropy, we propose to present one and all
with—a cork jacket ! Q.
BLACK AND WHITF.
THE French papers give the following story—received neat as im-
ported from the isle of Cuba. Six hundred negroes had been sold by
an American slave-dealer, but in three weeks after the sale, they all
disappeared in one night.
- 1

A LEFT TENANT of The luxt BER TRoop.
It was afterwards discovered that the 600 pretended negroes had
sailed for Jamaica, takin: their places as-white passengers | The
fact is, they had stained their skins with nitrate of silver or lunar
caustic to pass for blacks—a fraud deposed to by a chemist who had
sold the commodity. -
We have received a letter from Cuba (from “our Own Corre-
spondent,”) on the matter. He states that the authorities are so
indignant at the fraud, that they are about to pass a law to prevent
its repetition. Henceforth, every person who buys a black man will
be allowed to boil him before paying for him. If he stand colour, the
bargain stands good; if not—Nor.
SONGS OF THE SEEDY.—No. XVI.
My lute hath only one sad tone,
It hath a mournful twang,
Its other strings are crack'd and gone,
By one unlucky bang.
Punch Delivered GRATUiTOLSLY.
You ask me why I don't restore
Its early sweetness, and fresh cord it;
Oh, no! I'll play on it no more—
Between ourselves—I can't afford it.
You tell me that my light guitar
Is now as silent as the grave,
That on it now I play no bar,
Though once it thrill'd with many a stave.
Alas ! to strike it once again,
More power than I possess requires;
The effort would be worse than vain-
My light guitar has lost its wires.
My heart, my lute, my light guitar,
All broken as they be,
As like unto each other are
As little pea to pea.
Come heart, come lute, guitar, and all,
In one lament ye all are blended !
Hang on your nails against the wall,—
I can't afford to get ye mended.
WAR PRIZES.
A GENT LEMAN at Holborn Chapel, Holborn Bars, a few nights
since propounded this doctrine, viz., “That the tenth of all spoils of
Christian States” ought to be devoted to the Church 1 A deputation
of Chelsea and Greenwich pensioners attended on the occasion, and
were so convinced that a tenth of everything obtained by war was
justly Church property, that both Greenwich and Chelsea, have sent
a tithe of their wooden legs to be manufactured into Lucifers for the

HORTICULTURAL INTELLIGENCE.
The new process of grafting cherries on to

THE NATURAL HISTORY OF COURTSHIP.
Chapt ER. I.-ConcenNING THE ORIGIN THE REof.
ND be sure you make it sharp,” ex-
claimed the blacksmith's lady, as she
stood over him at his work.
“As the tongues of Hydra, my
love,” answered the obedient husband,
bouncing his hammer upon the anvil
with an unnecessary clatter, so as to
! drown the sound of his wife's voice.
# Of the two noises he liked that of his
tº own making by far the best.
“And when Eros comes back with
ſº the shaft, do not lose a minute in finish-
*ing the arrow. Where can he be stay-
ing He has been gone nearly an hour, and it is not quite two hun-
dred miles to Paphos : Meantime it is really quite distressing to
think how many of my admirers this newly come-out beauty may
have withdrawn from the sphere of my attractions.”
At this moment the missing young gentleman appeared, and the
arrow was completed in a trice.
“And now,” began Venus, when her son was equipped, “fly your
swiftest to where all the eligible inen in the world are flocking to
behold this Psyche, whose beauty is said to rival mine. Transfix her
heart—inflame her with a passion for something mean ;-for the clerk
of a Memphian bank—or, if you like, for one of our cyclops. This will
spoil her coquetting, and she will soon fret herself into the ugliness
of Atropos.”
“Mother, I fly (" exclaimed the dutiful son, suiting the action to
the word.
When the young archer arrived at his destination, he heard that
the belle who gave his mother so much uneasiness was dispensing
the hospitalities of a fête champetre to the élite of the surrounding plains.
He instantly sent in his card, and concealed himself amidst a group
of nymphs to watch the effect the announcement would have upon
the hostess.
“Good gracious !” exclaimed the beauty, on receiving the card,
“what an odd sensation . I never felt so strangely in all my life. I—”
“Hadn't you better faint, my love?” interrupted her chaperon :
“there is young Dandelius and several of your admirers looking on.”
“No, no. I really am too much overpowered for that. To think
that he should come to do me homage . All the way from Lemnos,
too. Say, how do I look '"
“Divine ! Yet, now I examine more closely, there is one stray
curl which—”
“To the brook, to the brook, for goodness sake and let me
arrange it.” “Eros, Deus Amoris ' ' she repeatedly ejaculated, speak-
ing ‘by the card.” “Where will my triumphs end ?”
But Psyche's agitation was stoicism compared with that of her new
visitor. He saw—and
loved 1
with one of his own arrows, he could not have been more dead to all
around but Psyche. In his ecstacy he dislocated one of his wings,

while flapping them for joy. He rushed to the brook where the
nymph was arranging her coiffure, but fearful of committing himself
to the ill-breeding of a scene, stopped suddenly short, apologised, and
politely tendered the compliments of the season.
Psyche's embarrassment was of short duration; she received the
god cordially, and pressed him to make a long sejour as the shooting
season was just commencing. Alas! with Cupid it was over; for he
not only forgot all about his arrow, but his errand.
Time (considerably more than twelve hours) passed on, and again
Venus had to call her son a naughty boy for staying so long on his
errands; whilst he, to make amends, sent his anxious motheramessage
in which he gave an exaggerated account of the accident to his wing,
and referred his detention to that cause. But Venus, a shrewd
woman, was seldom out, though she knew her son was. She guessed
the truth. The new beauty did possess all the powers which were
attributed to her, had–horresco referens—actually entrapped her son 1
The ! but no, she would not call names—thank the gods, she
was too well bred for that. “The nameless minx —to be sure she
was called “Psyche;’ but what did that mean — butterfly. A
more suitable title would have been “mushroom ; 'for nobody knows
who or what her family were ; as to fortune, the Delphian on dits
declare she has not a penny And to dare to aspire to so splendid
an alliance | Something must be done—something desperate. I’ll
Had he committed psychological suicide, by shooting himself
speak to Mercury on the subject, and if he cannot hit upon a prompt
and effectual scheme, the whole affair, together with the parties to it,
shall be swallowed up in a grand catastrophe. Vulcan must oblige
me with an earthquake.”
By a fortunate apropos, Mercury had just arrived at the forge with
an extensive order for thunderbolts from an “illustrious personage.”
The irate goddess instantly stated her case, which even Vulcan, who
was by, agreed was a hard one. Mercury heard her to the end with
wonderful patience, and then addressed her thus:—
“I grieve, my dearmadam, that any son of mine—but more par-
ticularly such a son—should prove so extremely soft as to fall in
love. Had it happened before our divorce, I might have cured him
by stopping his allowance, or cutting off the entail of the Paphian
estate. As it is, however, I am rather glad that this affair has hap-
pened. Don't start. The truth is, it offers me a valuable opportunity :
for introducing some reforms into the Olympian legislature that I
have long contemplated. The privileges belonging to both of us are
shamefully circumscribed by the simple, artless state in which the
law of elections at present stands. I of course mean the mutual elec-
tion and (by our son) predestination of lovers. A glance of the eye
—one coup from his arrow—Hymen is called in, and the whole matter
ends. Matrimony, which most of us have found a serious matter”
(here Vulcan groaned assent), “is brought about in by far too off-hand
a manner—difficulties ought to be thrown in the way—difficulties of
the parties' own making. To enjoy the happiness of wedded bliss with
the greater zest, lovers ought to pass through a previous purgatory.
Beauty, my dear Venus, will then possess a new power—that delicious
one of teasing ; while my privilege, chicanery, will also have full
scope. What say you? May I count on your support Grant it; and
Cupid and Psyche shall be our first victims.”
He said; and off the trio started for Olympus, delighted with the
measure.
Meantime, Cupid was in the most agonising embarras. He knew
full well that, by marrying without parental consent, he stood a dis-
gusting chance of being kicked, like his father-in-law, out of
heaven. Yet, could he forget Psyche –Never. Besides he had no
time to reflect, for at that moment she was flirting with Dandelius ;
should he cut him out Distraction 1
His mind was made up, and his bow-string—he aimed point blank.
His victim approached—he shot—she staggered, and fell—into his
arms. -
“It's all right !” exclaimed the god, in the poetical fervour of
passionate enthusiasm. “She’s mine ! Send for Hymen, and tell
Bacchus to prepare a champagne breakfast for the entire populationſ”
“Too late 1" screamed Venus, who, with Mercury, became dis-
agreeably visible to their son. “Faltering boy how dare you act so
unworthy of your parentage and education ? Alas! as you hare
inspired the girl with a passion, there is no help for it.”
“But un peu de réranche,” interjected the father of Frenchmen, the
light fantastic Mercury.
“Since we last met, the union has been repealed. Love was,
last evening, partly taken out of your and Nature's hands—it
is now decreed to be an art, which not only yourself, but all under
your influence, will in future have to study as a practical science ; and
before Hymen's torch can be lighted you must pass through an inter-
mediate state, which, by the DCLX. of Jupiter I. cap. 11, is intituled—

Here the paper from which the above is translated (a Greek MS.
consisting of an acta diurna, called “The Lemnonian Morning Post,
and Olympian Court Circular,” for which we beg to return our
sincere thanks to King Otho, who obligingly discovered it amidst
some ruins on purpose to present to us,) breaks off. Other historians,
and particularly Tooke, in his “Pantheon,” inform us that, after a
series of reverses, Cupid and Psyche were married, and had one
pledge, called “Pleasure.” That the story is ºuthentic, the exist-
ence at the present day of Courtship, as one of the finest of the fine
arts, fully proves.
And now, my dear Lady Letitia, cease to simper, and say you
are only thirty—You, excellent Miss Smith, who are dying for
matrimony, yet have said “No” to a dozen offers–You, enchanting
Angelica, who love Julian to distraction, because your mamma ap-
proves of Jenkins—You, amiable Rosa Gaiety, do leave off waltzing
with every man who asks you—Let me implore you, beautiful Lydia,
not to ask any more my “candid opinion” of your love verses-

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON IDLER.
1,–WHICH IS MEli ELY INTRODUCTORY.
EAR Readerſ
once more, at
the commence-
ment of a new
volume, do we
offer you our
hand in greet-
ing; not with
the slight for-
mality of here-
tofore, but we
hope as an old
friend. From
5 week to week
have we com-
muned toge-
ther in buoy-
ant company
—haply the
whims and
sunshine of our
harmless co-
lumns have
driven away
an occasional
cloud of vexa-
tion; and if we
have not ex-
actly met at
the saline
board, or saun-
tered together on the same promenade, yet let us regard each
other with such feelings of companionship, as a passing opinion in
which you agreed with us, or found your own ideas reflected,
should generate.
We confess that we are rather nervous at beginning our new
series. Every bather will allow that the first plunge of the season is
an awkward affair, even if he is not a novice at such aquatic exer-
cises, and the sun is out, and the water tepid. So do we feel a slight
timidity at making a fresh dive into the stream of public favour,
although we trust we have many and kind friends about us, who will
lend a hand if required, and come forward in the capacity of a literary
Humane Society.
We would commence with the usual invocation; but we found in
“Evening Parties,” after every spell we could summon to our aid,
that no muse appeared to inspire us: we almost think the lady has
been so much called upon of late, to no purpose, by various amateurs,
that when an author in sober earnest raises the cry of “Help!” she
refuses to come.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Neither can we hope for any necromantic assistance from the most
potent incantations: even if we illuminated our laboratory (by
which, be it understood we mean our solitary attic) with candles
made from Madame Tussaud's choicest figures melted down—if we
kindled the fire which heated our alembic with the last new plays
and ballads—blew it with a full band of ophicleides, trumpets,
bassoons, and cornopeans, and damped its ardour when it burnt too
fast with certain newspapers and periodicals. But the glamour of
magic expired with Dr. Dee; and the happy purchaser of his piece
of small-coal at Strawberry Hill, found no longer any visions reflected
on its polished surface: the imp of darkness has not appeared since
his celebrated “Walk”—possibly feeling hurt at O. Smith and Wie-
land, for their assumption of his character: the race of wizards left
in dudgeon, when Dobler and Anderson came to conjure at our
theatres; and the wrinkled hags of old ordered relays of broom-
sticks at the different posting clouds on the air-roads to the Hartz
mountains, and flew off, as soon as they became sensible that Vestris,
Nesbitt, and Murray, with the score of beauties that twinkle around
them, possessed far more powerful spells to enchant us in their eyes
and lips. Despairing, at length, to elaborate any new subjects at
home, we will rush out into those never-ending miscellanies of
original and striking scenes, which cost nothing to study, and never
tire by their monotony—the streets of London.
We adore the streets. We know there are thousands of our fellow-
men who regard them merely as the spaces included by two boundary
lines of bricks and mortar, subservient only to the purposes of com-
merce, or the transition from one spot to another. But we look upon
them as cheap exhibitions—al fresco national galleries of the most in-
teresting kind, furnishing ever-varying pictures of character or inci
dent; and in this feeling we will loiter on the pavements of their
noisy and bustling thoroughfares, and strive to draw our likenesses
from the every-day life and every-day people we may there encounter.
But we will not keep exclusively to the streets; if occasion requires
it we will follow the idlers of this great metropolis to their different
haunts—for the idlers alone are we about to sketch in their various
spheres and phases.
And so, loitering loungers, we warn you all—“a chiel's amang
ye takin' notes;” and he may be at your elbow when you least ex-
pect it. The simple pavement-beater of Regent-street; the listless
bachelor of small independence—that unfortunate medium, which
debars him from indulging in the most available luxuries, whilst it
gives him a distaste for any exertion; the mere sight-seer from the
country; the habitué of the playhouse; the spectator of the street
exhibition—may all find a place in our Physiology.
And, finally, in the words of Fielding, we will submit our sketches
to the candid reader with only two requests; “first, that he will not
expect to find perfection therein; and secondly, that he will excuse
some parts, if they fall short of that little merit which it is hoped
Inay appear in others.” For we would be respectful to all, and not,

PUNCH2S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
73tbitation.
To THE RIGHT HON. THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN (WHOEVER HE MAYBE.)
My Lorn,
Take my word for it, you have greater reason to be proud of
this Dedication than of your wand of office. Having read it, you may,
for the remainder of your official life, walk in the eyes of all men at
least half an inch higher. As, however, persons in your exalted rank
are not always inevitably promoted to the eminence by the profun-
dity of their reasoning powers, or the subtlety of their wit, it may,
perhaps, be necessary for me to explain to you why, from this day
forward, you should enjoy an increase of official altitude. Few things
irk a man more, than to know he has inflicted the heaviest, yet withal
the sweetest obligation on another, who yet obstinately remains in the
most Stygian ignorance of the fact. Fancy, my lord, a pearl-diver—
your lordship may possibly guess the perils of the trade—having
plunged to the bottom of the oozy deep; strange, horrid monsters
about him ; the ocean booming and rolling over him; fearful thoughts
of his wife and little ones stirring in his breast; imagine him groping
for the treasure which, it may be, is destined to repose upon the pal-
pitating bosom of an Eastern queen. He rises to the surface of the
deep—he is on dry land. Happy diver 1 he hath fished up an onion—
“Richer than that which four successive kings
In Denmark’s crown have worn "
He believes his fortune made ; the precious pearl has enriched him,
his wife, and little ones for life. Alas, no the waywardness of Fate
denies to his pearl the asylum of a crown, refuses to it the ear offi
queen. No : that pearl, by the very wilfulness of Destiny, is flung
among the wash of pigs, and is swallowed with a grunt by that bacon
hog, altogether unconscious of the treasure to be dissolved into
nothing by his porcine chyle. Now, he must be a hard-hearted man—
a lout, a churl—who would deny to the poor pearl-diver the barren
satisfaction of pinching the pig's tail, to assure the beast, as well and
as reasonably as a beast can be assured of anything, that he has swal-
lowed the jewel—that he has the worth of I knew not how many bars
of gold in his ignorant bowels. No: Justice—who though she may
not choose to use them, yet keeps her scales and weights in every
man's breast—Justice declares that the man shall have the rightful
privilege of pinching the pig's tail; or, in familiar phrase, that he
shall not lose his pearl without having a squeak for it" |
Now, my lord, hold me not guilty of any unseemly parallels. It is
true, in the following letters you will, I know, meet with as many
poarls as you ordinarily see at a royal drawing-room; nevertheless,
do not for an instant believe that I libel you as a hog. No, my lord,
repress, annihilate the nascent thought. Yet, consider, that as this
Dedication, like a patent iron coffin, is expressly hammered out to
last until doom's-day—consider, my lord, how many chamberlains,
and how various their capacities, may exist between this time and the
world's end It is to meet all possible accidents that may occur to all
• It is, perhaps, not generally known, that this common expression originated in
a decree of one of the Eastern courts; which alluded to a pearl-diver, deprived of his
property by the ignorance of a hog, all the satisfaction that was to be obtained was
from the hog's tail.—See Asiatic Researches.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
future Lords Chamberlain, that I here insist on dwelling upon the
obligation I have laid them under, by dedicating to them these–
adamantine letters 1
Having resolved to publish, I looked serenely round the world for
a nominal patron. At first, I thought the Lord Chancellor, as legal
guardian of the defenceless rich—for there is not one of these letters
that may not be considered as the orphan inheritor of invaluable
wealth, that is, if wisdom always went as at the trunk-maker's, by
avoirdupois weight, I thought the genius of the woolsack might fitly
protect these costly epistles; but reflecting upon the many orphans,
the many lunatics, too, yet upon his lordship's hands, I instantly re-
solved not to swell the number of his responsibilities, and, therefore,
thought again.
Next, the rattle of the Prince of Wales fell upon my ear. “These
Letters,” said I, “shall be dedicated to the Prince : they will
especially serve to commemorate the day on which his Royal High-
ness was taken out of long frocks—the brevity of every epistle will
touchingly illustrate the shortness of his coats.” My wife exulted
at the idea. “The very thing,” said she ; “for, isn't there our last
boy. Ugolino he'll want something as he grows up ; and the Prince
can't do less than make him a tide-waiter.” The mercenary specula-
tion—for all women are not mothers of Gracchi—determined me to
give up the Prince of Wales. “No 1" said I, “the dirty motive-
makers of the world will be sure to misconstrue the act; they will
swear that ‘PUNch’ was only loyal that he might be prosperous;
they will say that he only worshipped the rising pap-spoon that his
own brat might catch the fragments that fell from it.” My heart
swelled at the suspicion, like a new-blown bladder, and I struck off
from my list the Prince of Wales.
I next looked into the Houses of Parliament. Here, I thought,
are people whom the world sometimes persist in taking for my blood
relations; and, it must be confessed, that both in the Upper and
Lower Senate words are spoken and capers cut, that—were I to be
impeached for either—it would, I fear, be very difficult for me to prove
an alibi. “Why, there's fifty of 'em, at least,” said Judy, “that you
can't persuade the world ar’n’t your own kith and kin.” “And for
that reason, Judy,” I replied, “I will have none of 'em. No ; I am
fully aware of the relationship myself; but it's their dirty pride that
chokes me—their arrogance that makes them sometimes pass me,
even in Parliament-street, as if I was to them an alien in blood, in
manners, and religion. And why?—I get my living in the open air.
Well; didn't Julius Caesar, the Duke of Marlborough, do the same
And when Wellington and Sibthorpe were on service, didn't they
labour, too, sub die? Can you gather laurels in a back parlour—can
you grow bay upon a hearth-rug f"
It was then, my lord, I resolved to dedicate these Letters to you.
The reason is obvious : the Lord Chamberlain merer did anything for
“Punch 1” You have graciously let me alone; and I have flourished
under the benignity of your neglect. I pitch my stage wheresoever
I will, in Westminster or not, without your warrant: I act my plays
without your licence. I discourse upon the world as it is, on the life
that is moving about us, and on the invisible emotions of the heart
of man, and pay no penny to your deputy. I increase in social im-
portance; for I am not withered by your patronage.
Had Fate made me, for these last two hundred years, the master of
a play-house, how different might have been my condition —Had
I, since the Act which made you protector and censor of the dramatic
sisters, Melpomene and Thalia—poor girls 1 there are people who
swear you have treated 'em worse than Mrs. Brownrigg used her ap-
prentices—had I felt your patronage, how often had I been banco
rotto, how often had I played—understand me, not paid—a “doleful
dump” in Portugal-street
Wherefore, then, do I dedicate to you these Letters —From an
exalted spirit of independence. I owe you nothing, my lord, and have
flourished rich upon the obligation. “ PUNCH.”
CROPS AND THE WEATHER.
They have already begun to gather in the barley for barley-water in
some parts, and a small grower at Brompton housed a pound and a half
of new potatoes last week, from the sixteenth of an acre of ground, with
a fine S.S.W. aspect.
The buttercups are very promising in the neighbourhood of London,
and if the fine weather continues, we may expect to see more of them.
Groundsel, which has lately risen into an important article of commerce,
is plentiful on the romantic embankments that skirt the suburban lanes;
and when we see the individuals clambering half way up in the dangerous
pursuit, with a ditch yawning at their feet, we are reminded of the de-
scription by Shakspeare, of “those who gather samphire.”

FoR THE
ADVANCEMENT OF EVERYTHING IN GENERAL,
AND NOTHING IN PARTICULAR.
ENTLE READER this
enlightened body is now at
Manchester, whither we have
despatched our own reporter,
for the purpose of collecting
all the interesting informa-
tion to be had; and we are
happy in laying before our
readers the following very
exciting particulars : — Pro-
fessor Dowell, in opening the
business of the day, was glad
to observe a large attendance
3 of foreigners. There was the
: distinguished Herr Cracken-
: jaw, from Poland; Professor
High-Sky-High, the great
# Astronomer; and, besides
- Him, Punch ; there was also
Herr Judy. A deputation was also present from the Eel Pie Islands,
and Professor Gratisgrub was also among the distinguished foreigners.
The Chairman began by announcing the gratifying fact, that the
Queen had graciously placed at the disposal of the Association, the
modern building in Richmond Park, formerly used as an Observa-
tory and latterly converted into a cow-house. (Heart hear!) A de-
putation had visited it, and found it very commodious. It was cer-
tainly falling to pieces, and no one could venture up the stairs; but a
civil engineer, and a very civil engineer he was, (heart hear!) had said
that it would hold together for twenty years, for any use that the
Association were likely to put it to. It was stated that the Royal
Society had declined the building, but they, the Association, had
jumped at it. (Loud cheers.)
A Member begged to inquire whether the building was not some-
times resorted to by the park-keepers in a shower.
The President admitted that it was. He, however, thought the
building chiefly of importance, as it gave a sort of local habitation to
the Association, which had hitherto had no direction to give, if
called upon for its address at a moment's notice. (Hear 1)
It was then moved, that the children of members be admitted.
A member approved the suggestion, and proposed, that the admis-
sion should be confined to the children alone; but as it was sug-
gested, that the presence of the parents would be necessary to make
the fun, of which the children were to have the benefit, the amend-
ment was withdrawn.
officers, civil AND MILITARY.
The association next proceeded to appoint the sections, and to
arrange the business of the week. The president was happy to say
that the civil authorities had met the association in a proper spirit,
and had resolved to throw open to members the Blind Asylum, the
Deaf and Dumb School, the New Prison, (heart hear!) and last, but
not least, the Asylum for Lunatics. (Tremendous cheering.)
A member wished to know whether any order would be required
for obtaining admission to the Lunatic Asylum ?
The president had no hesitation in saying, that the mere fact of
belonging to the association would be considered, of itself, a suffi-
cient qualification to obtain an introduction to any of the Asylums
for Lunatics. (Loud cheers.)
The sectional meetings commenced on Thursday.
Section A included Physics; and Professor Woodenhead read a
paper on the Blue-pill, taken in connexion with the Black-draught,
which excited considerable interest. A paper was also read on the
Distribution of Light, which included a very interesting episode on
the Window-tax. A practical illustration of the Polarization of Light

was unexpectedly exhibited, by a scaffolding-pole being accidentally
thrust through the window of the room in which the members were
sitting.
sºlos B.—Dr. Dulltone made some observations on the pen-
dulum of a clock, as affected by the playfulness of a kitten; and
concluded, from experiments he had made, that no clock could bear
more than two minutes worrying. He had also remarked that a
person who ate well and took little exercise rapidly fattened; while
the Bedouin Arabs, who hunted a great deal, were lean and sinewy.
He attributed the active properties of tea to the quantity of birch
introduced into it; while its sedative qualities were accounted for by
the sloe particles.
Section C.—GEology.—Mr. Professor Blowhisnose read a paper
on the chain of the Alps, which he contrasted very cleverly with St.
Paul's Chain; and he concluded his remarks by some allusion to the
ordinary Berlin chains, one of which was attached to his eye-glass.
He thought that the word straighter or strata should not be applied to
the soil of mountains, but that the word crookeder would be much
intelligibler, if he might be allowed to say so.
Mr. Softinwitz, who had been appointed to keep a register of the
shocks of earthquakes in Regent-street during the past year, handed
in four reams of blank foolscap as the result of his observations.
Section D.—BotANY-Professor Sorrytwaddle produced a large
quantity of preserved leaf, which he had met with in a cupboard of
his own residence: it was red and crisp, exhibiting all the ordinary
characteristics of pickled cabbage. A committee was immediately
formed to set upon it; and they did set upon it in good earnest, for
in a few minutes the jar was empty. A verdict was unanimously
returned of preserrata rehiculi attas; or, pickled cab-age.
Mr. Moore exhibited a piece of pickled salmon, which gave rise to
an interesting discussion, for the salmon was at once discussed, in
conjunction with a rare specimen of Dublin stout, and a curious col-
lection of rolls, usually called French-cut, entirely manufactured in
England.
SEction E.-MEDIcAl SciENcE.—Colonel Sibthorpe, and Mr.
Muntz, who were both invited to the Society as extraordinary fel-
lows, presented two alarming cases of enlargement of the whiskers
SEction F.—STAt 1st Ics.-This section came out, as usual, par-
ticularly strong. A paper was read on the average number of Con-
greves in each box sold in the streets, and some very interesting
calculations were gone into of the amount of cherry-stones picked up
between Clerkenwell Green, and Clapham Common, on the 15th of
last August.
At the general meeting a statement of the funds was gone into by
the chairman. It appeared that the association had got its own
reports in hand, which at three pence a pound (and a scientific
butterman had offered three-pence halfpenny) (enthusiastic cheers),
would bring the members quite home, at least as to being called upon
for any deficiency. It now became a question, what was to be done :
The association had already visited all the large towns, and it was
very doubtful if it would be advisable to return to any one of them;
or, to speak candidly, it was pretty certain that the large towns would
rather decline their company. It was true there were smaller places,
and Hockley-in-the-Hole, as well as Stoke Pogis, had sent pressing
invitations, and probably, if they went to either Stoke Pogis or
Hockley-in-the-Hole, they ought on the whole to prefer Hockley.
THE NELSON MONUMENT.
The rapidity with which the works of this national column are pro-
ceeding, astonishes, it is said, even the subscribers themselves. The two
workmen have actually succeeded in raising another stone A third
hand is to be taken ou immediately :
CONCERNING SISTERS-IN-LAW.
I.
Thry looked so alike as they sat at their work,
(What a pity it is that one isn't a Turk 1)
The same glances and smiles, the same habits and arts,
The same tastes, the same frocks, and (no doubt) the same hearts.
The same irresistible cut in their jibs,
The same little jokes, and the same little fibs—
That I thought the best way to get out of my pain
Was by—heads for Maria, and woman for Jane;
For hang me if it seemed it could matter a straw,
Which dear became wife, and which sister-in-law.
II.
But now, I will own, I feel rather inclined
To suspect I’ve some reason to alter my mind; -
And the doubt in my breast daily grows a more strong one,
That they're not quite alike, and I’ve taken the wrong one.
Jane is always so gentle, obliging, and cool ;
Never calls me a monster—not even a fool;
All our little contentions, 'tis she makes them up,
And she knows how much sugal to put in my cup :-
Yes, I sometimes have wished—Heav’n forgive me the flaw —
That my very dear wife was my sister-in-law.
III.
Oh, your sister-in-law, is a dangerous thing!
The daily comparisons, too, she will bring !
Wife—curl-papered, slip-shod, unwashed and undressed ;
She—ringleted, booted, and “fixed in her best ;”
Wife—sulky, or storming, or preaching, or prating ;
She—merrily singing, or laughing, or chatting:
Then the innocent freedom her friendship allows
To the happy half-way between mother and spouse
In short, if the Devil e'er needs a cat's-paw,
He can't find one more sure than a sister-in-law.
IV.
That no good upon earth can be had undiluted
Is a maxim experience has seldom refuted;
And preachers and poets have proved it is so
With abundance of tropes, more or less apropos.
Every light has its shade, every rose has its thorn,
The cup has its head-ache, its poppy the corn ;
There's a fly in the ointment, a spot on the sun–
In short, they've used all illustrations—but one;
And have left it to me the most striking to draw—
Wiz.: that none, without wives, can have sisters-in-law.
“BROUGHAM FOR SALE.”
This important sign of the times appeared last week in the Herald;
coincident, too, with his Lordship's Tory Speech on the Income-Tax.
The price was not stated. -

MISS TICKLETOBY'S LECTURES ON
ENGLISH HISTORY.
A CHARACTER,
(to INTRomuce ANothen chan acter).
E have the pleasure
to be acquainted with a
young fellow by the name
of Adolphus Simcoe, who,
like many another person
of his age and rank in
life, has been smitten with
a love for literary pur-
suits, which have brought
him to early ruin.
He gained a decent
maintenance as assistant
in the shop of Messrs. , apothecaries, Cheapside, but even then
was observed never to move without a Byron in his pocket, and used to
amuse the other gents in the establishment, by repeating whole pass-
ages from Shelley, Wordsworth, and Moore. To one young man he
confided a large ledger of poems, of his own composition ; but being
of a timid turn, and the young man falling asleep during the reading of
the very first ballad, Adolphus never attempted a similar proceeding
with any of his comrades again, but grew more morose and poetical,
frequenting the theatres, coming late to business, living alone, and
turning down his shirt collars more and more every day. Messrs.
Butler had almost determined, although with regret, to turn away
the lad, when he prevented that step on their part, by signifying his
own intention to retire. His grandmother, who, we are led to
believe, kept a small shop in the town of York, left Adolphus a
fortune of three hundred pounds in the three per cents., which sum
he thought fully adequate for the making of his fortune in his own
Way.
i. passion was to become an editor of a Magazine; to assemble
about him “the great spirits of the age,” as he called them ; and to
be able to communicate his own contributions to the public, aided
by all the elegances of type, and backed by all the ingenuities of
uffery.
P .. celebrated miscellany, the “Lady's Lute,” then being for sale
—indeed, if agentleman has a mind to part with his money, it is very
hard if he cannot find some periodical with a broom at its mast-
head, Adolphus, for the sum of forty-five pounds, became the
proprietor and editor of the Lute ; and had great pleasure in seeing
his own name in the most gothic capitals upon the title-page—his
poems occupying the place of honour within. The honest fellow has
some good mercantile notions, and did not in the least hesitate to
say, on the part of the proprietors, and on the fly-leaf of the maga-
zine, that the Public of England would rejoice to learn, that the
great aid of ADOLPHUS SIMCOE, ESQ., has been secured, at an
immense expense, for the Lady's Lute; that his contributions would
henceforth be solely confined to it, and that the delighted world would
have proofs of his mighty genius in song.
Having got all the poets by heart, he had a pretty knack of imitat-
ing them all, and in a single ballad would give you specimens of, at
least, half-a-dozen different styles. He had, moreover, an emphatic
way of his own, which was for a little time popular ; and the public,
for near a year, may be said to have been almost taken in by Adolphus
Simcoe—as they have been by other literary characters of his kind.
It is, we do believe, a fact, that for a certain time Adolphus's Magazine
actually paid its contributors; and it is a known truth, that one India
paper proof of the portrait of himself, which he published in the
second year of his editorship, was bought by a young lady, a sincere
admirer of his poems.
In the course of eighteen months he exhausted his manuscript
ledger of poetry—he published his “Ghoul,” a poem in Lord Byron's
style; his “Leila,” after the manner of Thomas Moore; his “Idio-
syncracy,” a didactic poem, that strongly reminded one of Words-
worth; and his “Gondola, a Venetian Lay,” that may be considered
to be slightly similar to the works of L. E. L. Then he came out
with a Tragedy, called “Perdition, or the Rosicrucian Gammons,”
of which the dulness was so portentous, that at the end of the fourth
act it was discovered there were not more than thirty-three sub-
scribers left to the magazine.
Suffice it to say, that though he continued the work desperately
for six months longer, pouring, as he said, the whole energies of his
soul into its pages—(the fact was, as that there was no more money,
there were no more contributors)—though he wrote articles pathetic,
profound, and humorous, commenced romances, and indited the most
bitter and sarcastic reviews, the “Lady's Lute” fell to the ground—its
chords, as he said, were rudely snapped asunder, and he who had
swept them with such joy, went forth a wretched and heart-broken
Inan.
He passed three months in Her Majesty's Asylum of the Fleet,
from whence he issued in brocade robe-de-chambre, and the possessor
of the cut-glass bottles and shaving trumpery of a dressing-case, the
silver covers of which he had pawned, in order to subsist while in
durance.
Our belief is that MissTickletoby is his relation : it is certain that
he sleeps in her back garret (and the venerable age of the lady puts
all scandal out of the question); he has, we are fully certain, in-
structed her pupils in penmanship, filling up his leisure moments by
writing what would have been contributions to the Magazines, if
those works would but have accepted the same.
He still speaks of the “Lady's Lute” as of the greatest periodical that
ever was produced, and but the other day apologised warmly to the
writer of this for having abused his early volume of Poems—“Lyrics
of the Soul” they were called—written at sixteen, when we were
students at the University of London. He persists in thinking that
the author of “Lyrics of the Soul” has never forgiven him, that he
has never been the same man since, but has pined away under the
effects of that withering sarcasm. Our next work, he says, was the
bitter Slough of Despair—it was called “The Downy Dragsman, or,
Love in Liquorpond-street.” This, at least, the reader will remember.
Could anything be more frank than its humour—more joyously low
than every one of the scenes in that truly racy production
It is needless to say, we have no sort of anger against poor
Adolphus; but that on the contrary meeting him very wild and
gloomy, and more than usually dirty, at the Globe, in Bow-street,
which we both frequent, it was a great pleasure to us to lend him
seven shillings, which enabled him to order a dish of meat, in addition
to that unhappy half-pint of beer which seemed really to form all his
dinner.
The dinner and the money made him communicative ; and he
was good enough to confide to us the history of a vast number of
his disappointments—“His blighted opes—his withered dreams of
hearly years—his “vain hambition,’” (Adolphus is a Londoner, what-
ever his grandmother may have been), and at the end of all, he
pulled out a manuscript (which is always rather a frightful object to
a literary man), but instead of reading it began, thank Heaven only
to discourse about it. It was another's writing, not his own.
“Halfred,” said he, “you know I hoccupy no common position
in the literary world. I ave at least done so, until misfortune
hovertook me. Since my sorrows, I’ve been kindly oused by a
munificent being—a woman (‘’ere's to er,’” said he, draining his
glass solemnly, “who doubles hall our joys, and alves hall our

sorrows—to woman.") Having finished his brandy-and-water, he
resumed :—
“Hever since hi've been in the ouse of that hangelic being—she's
hold, Halfred, hold enough to be my grandmother, and so I pray you
let the sneer pass away from your lips—hi’ve not neglected, has you
may himagine, the sacred calling for which hi feel hi was born. Poesy
has been my solace in my lonely hagonies, hand I’ve tried the news-
papers hall round. But they're a callous and ard earted set, those
literary men—men who have feasted at my table, and quaffed of my
wine-cup—men, who in the days of my prosperity have grown rich
from my purse—will you believe it, they won't accept a single har-
ticle of my writing, and scornfully pass me by 1 Worse than this—
they refuse to elp me by the most simple puff, for me and mine;
would you believe it, my dear friend, Miss Tickletoby has just com-
menced a series of lectures, for which hi'm hanxious to get the world's
good opinion, and not one paper will hinsert the little description
I’ve written off. The Hage, the Hargus, the Hera, hi’ve applied to
'em all, and they’re hall the same—hall, hall, ungrateful.”
“My dear fellow, if you will write verse,” said I—
“It's not verse,” answered Adolphus, “it’s prose—a report of Miss
T.’s lecture, prefaced by a modest leading harticle.”
“I’ll see if I can get it into “Punch,’” said I.
“Hush, Punch 1” shouted he, “Heavens, have you fallen so low
I, write in Punch Gracious powers . In Punch—in Punch l’”
“Rum or brandy, sir?” said Betsy, the waiter, who caught the last
word.
“Rum,” said Adolphus (with a good deal of presence of mind); and
as he drank the steaming liquor took my hand. “Halfred,” said he,
“tell me this one thing—does “Punch' pay for, between ourselves,
Miss Tickletoby says that she'll turn me out of doors unless I can
make myself useful to her and—pay my bill.”
Adolphus Simcoe is to be paid for his contributions, and nert week
we shall begin Miss Tickletoby's Lectures.
-
THE NEW HALF FARTHINGS.
It is expected that the new half farthings will have a very powerful
effect upon the money market, and a great deal has already been pro-
spectively done in them. We have heard that the difficulty of expressing
the value of the great unactable tragedy of Martenuzzi by any coin then
in existence, first gave the idea of coining a piece of half a farthing; but
even this measure, it is supposed, will not meet the case alluded to. We
beg to submit the following design for the reverse.
THE HEALTH OF THE METROPOLIS.
For the week ending June 25th, there were no less than five million
sneezes and twenty-four thousand colds in the head, which, taking the
population at ten millions, gives half a sneeze to each. This is a quarter
of a sneeze less to each person than in the corresponding week of last
year, and one-eighth of a sneeze less than the average of the last four years.
It appears, from a report given in to the Board of Health, that there
have been twenty thousand cases of chilblains among fifty thousand tight
boots; so that dividing the one by the other, and seeing #. many times
the chilblains will go intº the boots, we find that Two forms the very
alarming quotient.
CONUNDRUMS OF THE SEEDY.
When are my snuffers not my snuffers —Ans. When they are my
scissors.
Why is my purse like Sibthorpe's brains?—Ans. Because I have not
got any.
Why is my coat, whether in doors or out of doors, exactly the same –
Ans. Because when it’s worn at home it is also worn out.
Why am I not to be imitated by any well-dressed person 1
º
-
Ans—Because no one who wished to be taken for a gentlemen could
possibly walk in my shoes.
what is the difference between me and my tailor, now that I am in
prison at his suit t—Ans. He won't let me out, and I have let hina in

THE Promenades de Soir have commenced for the season in Lambeth-
Walk and the New-Cut, where they will be continued every Saturday.
There was an excellent Show in both places of Congreve lights, children's
chairs, and three-penny cinder-shovels. The amusing process of selling
spinach at a halfpenny a lapful, is to be continued every Saturday until
further notice.
Giuseppe Rinaldi has left Town for Margate, with his hand organ. His
suite included a monkey.
Among the arrivals we have only to notice Frow Swindel (the broom-
girl), from Bavaria.
THE “SLIGHT” SCHOOL OF DRAMA.
August “PUNch,”—Inasmuch as I find my little exhibition of the
Elizabethan style hath called forth, from an abler hand, another in the
Victorian style, I do flaunt myself about right heartily; for I find I
am likely to be the father, as it were, of those who do subtilely inves-
tigate matters connected with stage-plays. Allow me, therefore, to
send you an entire Drama, belonging to what I call the “Slight
School,” for it be very slight, in construction, language, wit, in short,
of the mass, I know not what it be not slight in. I send it, not
because I am vain of my work, for I do utterly despise it, but to
show what I think to be the amount of wit in such stage-plays as
are written about Sylphides, Gnomes, Grottoes, and the like. The
play itself, I warrant not to occupy ten minutes in the performance;
but if the manager will introduce a pas-de-deur or a pas-de-trois, as
we conceitedly term them after our Gallican neighbours, he may
make it last three hours. Allow me to call myself, not “ONE of THE
MANY,” as in No.43, but—exalted by your encouragement—
“Out of THE Common.”

NTRODUCTION
TO PUNCH*S LETTERS.
In humane compliance with the incessant and af.
fecting supplication of many hundred bosom
friends, these epistles are for the first time sub-
mitted to print. Yes, Iswearit; and to solemnise
the oath, I am ready to kiss a bank-note of any
amount above fifty pounds,--I do not rush into
type, scourged to the act by an empty purse;
but am wholly won to the proceeding by the
have—as, indeed, I feel I ought to have—yearnings of peculiar
affection.
These letters were originally addressed to, I verily believe, my own
son. In these letters I have endeavoured to enshrine the wisdom of
my life. In them, I have sought to paint men as they are—to sketch
the scenes of the world as they have presented themselves to my
observation—to show the spring of human motives—to exhibit to the
opening mind of youth the vulgar wires that, because unseen, make a
mystery of common-place.
I am prepared to be much abused for these epistles. They are
written in lemon-juice. Nay, the little sacs in the jaws of the rattle-
snake, wherein the reptile elaborates its poison to strike with sudden
death the beautiful and harmless guinea-pigs and coneys of the
earth—these venomous bags have supplied the quill that traced the
mortal sentences. Or if it be not really so, it is no matter; the
worthy, amiable souls, who would have even a Sawney Bean painted
upon a rose-leaf, will say as much : so let me for once be beforehand,
and say it for them.
The child for whose instruction and guidance through life these
letters were especially composed, has passed from this valley of
shadows—he is dead. Death, in its various modes of approach, is an
accordant mystery with the mystery of life. To one man it comes in
the guise of a grape-stone—to another in the aspect of a jackass
eating figs. To my dear son Death appeared in the tempting shape of
a fine South Down wether. Yes, mutton was his fate.
Had it pleased fortune to make me a man of Bank-paper, the life
of my darling child might have been spared. Then had I shown that
the dear boy acted only in obedience to an irresistible impulse born
with him—strengthened by maternal milk—made invincible by oft
indulgence. Then had I proved that the child in what he did was
but the innocent accessary of his unconscious mother.
I have dried my eyes, and will endeavour to explain myself.
Three months, to a day, before the birth of my child, we had not
for the previous eight-and-forty hours rejoiced our loyalty with the
sight of his majesty's head even upon copper; and yet—be Mercury
my judge —we worked most gallantly—handed round the hat most
perseveringly—laughed most jocosely, and all with bleeding hearts
and a slow-fire burning in our bowels. Nathless, halfpence came not.
At that time, I remember, we were terribly run upon by Parliament.
The madness of politics took away the people's brains; and literature,
and art, and Punch, while the mania lasted, were—strange infatua-
tion of men —neglected for the House of Commons !
Four-and-twenty times in four-and-twenty streets had we acted that
day, and yet no coin fell in the oft-presented hat. With thoughts of
an empty garret, a supperless destiny if money came not—of my
unrepining, much-enduring wife—of all her wants in that her time of
weakness, with all these horrid memories blazing in my brain, I
rattled away, and laughed, and cried and crowed roo-tooit-roo-tooit in
entreaties of sundry fathers, for whose children I
every key and cadence, and heard myself bruited by the mob as a
merciless, unfeeling rascal. without one touch of humanity for aught
that breathed. Alas! at that moment I had an ulcer in my heart big
as a rat-hole.
Evening came on, and with it cold and drizzling rain. We were
preparing for our twenty-fifth representation, when a delicious odour
suddenly steamed through the canvas, and on the instant, a voice
—to my foolish ear sweet as the multitudinous voices of cherubin–
cried—
“Hot, hot—all hot—mutton pies, all hot!”
My dear wife placed her hand upon her heart—she knew I had not
a penny—softly sighed, then fell in a dead swoon into my arms.
There she lay, and still the retreating voice rang through the night—
“Hot, hot—all hot—mutton pies, all hot!”
At length my spouse returned to life. With the fine delicacy, the
mighty self-denial of her sex, she breathed not her wish. But I looked
in her eyes, and read—Mutton 1
And who, after this, can wonder at—much more blame—my darling,
blighted son for his uncontrollable affection for South Down, or in
fact any other, wethers ?
Oh, ye thousands of philosophers dozing, dreaming, yawning in
garrets— oh, ye broad-brimmed, long-shirted, ankle-jacked sages, who
look into men's skulls as men look into glass-hives—who untwist the
cords of the human heart carefully yet surely as the huswife
untangles a skein of silk—could not twelve of ye be found to go into
a box to discuss, and by your verdict dignify as pretty a case of morals
and Inetaphysics as ever came from the Press-yard But no dry-
salters, hardwaremen, yea, ropemakers (for my innocent boy never
thought to challenge the last jurymen as peculiarly interested in the
verdict), judged him, and of course he was lost.
As a further illustration of the benighted intellect of the jury, it
was argued against my boy—my doomed one from the womb 1–that
he had on a previous occasion shown a violent love for a bale of
Welsh flannel, the property of a hosier on Ludgate-hill. Of course
he had. It was the inevitable result of his constitution. The flan-
nel was part of the sheep. What he did, he did from necessity. He
was organized for the act. The jury—asses —called it a second
offence. Why, it was one and the same thing. Nay, had my child
made off with a gross or two of lambs'-wool socks, and half-a-dozen
Witney blankets, a philosophic jury would have considered the col-
lective acts as but an individual emanation of pre-organized tem-
perament; and, pitying the mother in the son, have returned a tri-
umphant acquittal. But what knew the jury of affinities
Had I been rich I could have proved all this, and my boy had
been saved upon a constitutional eccentricity. As it was—but I will
no longer dwell upon the theme. Enough for the curious. My boy's
fate may be found in the archives of Seven Dials.
These letters will, I trust, testify my paternal solicitude. It is my
pride, that they were treasured by my son, and were bequeathed by
him, with other effects, to the individual whose adroit attention to
my boy in his last moments was witnessed by hundreds, and com-
mented upon in the handsomest way by various distinguished writers
of the English press. It is to the liberality of this individual I am
indebted for the original documents; for, elevated far above the
petty spirit of huckstering, he at a word took a pot of porter for the
treasure, and, with a significant wink and a light-hearted laugh,
wished me joy of my bargain.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MISS TICKLETOBY'S LECTURE.
We have just had the joy to be present at one of the most splendid
exhibitions of intelligence which has been witnessed in our splendid
and intelligent time.
The great spirit of History, distilled in a mighty mind's alembic,
outpouring clear, rich, strong, intoxicating oft—so delicious was the
draught, and so eager the surrounding drinkers—the figures of states-
men and heroes, wise heroes and heroic statesmen, caught up from
their darkness in the far past, and made by the enchantress to shine
before us visible; the gorgeous and gigantic memories of old Time
rising stately from their graves, and looking on us as in life they
looked : such were the thoughts, sensations, visions, that we owe to
the eloquence of Miss Tickletoby this day.
We write under a tremendous emotion, for the words of the fair
speaker still thrill in our ears; nor can we render account of one
tithe part of that mystic harmony of words, that magic spell of poesy,
which the elegant oratrix flung round her audience—a not readily-to-
be-dissipated charm.
Suffice it to say, that pursuant to her announcements in the public
prints, this accomplished lady commenced her series of lectures on
English history to-day. Her friends, her pupils, those who know and
esteem her (and these consist of the rarest of England's talent, and
the brightest of her aristocracy), were assembled at one o'clock
punctually in her modest dwelling (No. 3, Leg of Veal Court, Little
Britain, over the greengrocer's; pull the third bell from the bottom).
We were among the first to attend, and gladly give the publicity of
our columns to a record of the glorious transactions of the day. The
reporters of this paper were employed in taking down every word
that fell from the speaker's lips—(would that they could have likewise
transferred the thrilling tones and magic glance which made her
words a thousand times more precious): we, on the other hand, being
from our habits more accustomed to philosophic abbreviation, have
been contented with taking down rather the heads and the suggestivity
(if we may use the phrase) of Miss Tickletoby's discourse, and we
flatter ourselves that upon a comparison with the text, the analysis
will be found singularly faithful.
We have spoken of the public character: a word now regarding
Miss Tickletoby the woman. She has long been known and loved in
the quarter of which she is the greatest blessing and ornament—that
of St. Mary Axe.
From her early life practising tuition, some of the best families of
the City owe to her their earliest introduction to letters. IHer Spelling-
book is well known, and has run through very nearly an edition ; and
when we rank among her pupils the daughter of one of the clerks of
Alderman Harmer, AND A Niece of A LATE Honour Ed Lord
Mayon, we have said enough to satisfy the most fastidious votary
of fashion with respect to the worldly position of those who sit at
Miss Tickletoby's feet.
Miss Tickletoby believes that education, to be effective, should be
begun early, and therefore receives her pupils from the age of two
upwards. Nay, she has often laughingly observed that she would
have no objection to take them from the month, as childhood's train-
ing can never be too soon commenced. Of course, at so tender an
age, sea is no consideration. Miss Tickletoby's children (as she loves
to call them) are both of the sterner and the softer varieties of our
human species.
With regard to her educational system, it is slightly coercive. She
has none of the new-fangled notions regarding the inutility of corporal
punishments, but remembering their effects in her own case, does
not hesitate to apply them whenever necessity urges.
On Wednesdays (half-holidays) she proposes to deliver a series of
lectures upon English history, occasionally (it would appear from a
hint in the present discourse) diversified by subjects of a lighter and
more holiday kind. We shall attend them all—mor can the public of
this city do better than follow our example. The price of tickets for
the six lectures is—ninepence.
Can such things be,
And overcome us like a summer cloud
Without our special wonder 2
THE LECTURE-ROOM.
The lecture was announced for one o'clock, and arriving at that
our, we found the room full of rank and fashion. Excellent accom-
modation was arranged for the public press. Flowers, some of those
cheap but lovely and odorous ones which form the glory of England's
garden, were placed tastefully here and there—on the mantel, on
the modest table at which stood the lecturer's chair, and a large
and fragrant bouquet in the window-sill. These were (with the
exception of a handsome curtain that hung before the door from
which Miss Tickletoby was to issue) the sole ornaments of the simple
academic chamber.
The lovely children, with wistful eyes and cheeks more flushed
than any roses there, were accommodated with their usual benches,
while their parents were comfortably ranged in chairs behind them.
'Twas indeed a thrilling sight—a sight to bring tears into the philan-
thropic heart—happy tears though—such as those spring showers
which fall from the lids of childhood, and which rainbow joy speedily
dries up again.
The bell rings —one moment—and the chintz curtain draws aside,
and midst waving of kerchiefs, and shouting of bravos, and with
smiling eyes fixed upon her, and young hearts to welcome her, THE
LEcTURER steps forth. Now, our task is over. Gentles, let the en-
chantress speak for herself.
Having cleared her voice, and gazing round the room with a look
of affection, she began
- the Lecture.
My LovEs, - -
With regard to the early history of our beloved country, before
King Alfred ascended the throne, I have very little indeed to
say; in the first place, because the story itself is none of the most
moral—consisting of accounts of murders agreeably varied by inva-
sions; and secondly, dears, because, to tell you the truth, I have
always found those first chapters so abominably stupid, that I have
made a point to pass them over. For I had an indulgent mama, who
did not look to my education so much as I do to yours, and provided
she saw Howell's Medulla before me, never thought of looking to see
whether Mother Goose was within the leaves. Ah, dears that is a
pleasant history too, and in holiday time we will have a look at that.
Well, then, about the abominable odious Danes and Saxons, the
Picts and the Scots, I know very little, and must say have passed
through life pretty comfortably in spite of my ignorance. Not that
this should be an excuse to you—no, no, darlings; learn for learning's
sake; if not, if I have something hanging up in the cupboard, and
you know my name is Tickletoby. (Great sensation.)
How first our island became inhabited is a point which nobody
knows. I do not believe a word of that story at the beginning of the
Seven Champions of Christendom, about King Brute and his com-
panions; and as for the other hypotheses, (Let Miss Biggs spell the
word ‘hypothesis, and remember not to confound it with “apothe-
cary,') they are not worth consideration. For as the first man who
entered the island could not write, depend on it he never set down
the date of his arrival; and I leave you to guess what a confusion
about dates there would speedily be—you who can't remember
whether it was last Thursday or Friday that you had gooseberry pud-
ding for dinner.
Those little dears who have not seen Mrs. Trimmer's History of
England have, no doubt, beheld pictures of Mr. Oldridge's balm of
Columbia. The ancient Britons were like the lady represented
there, only not black; the excellent Mrs. T.'s pictures of these, no
doubt, are authentic, and there our ancestors are represented as
dressed in painted skins, and wearing their hair as long as possible.
I need not say that it was their own skins they painted, because, as
for clothes, they were not yet invented.
Perhaps some of my darlings have seen at their papas' evening
parties some curious (female) Britons who exist in our own time,

CHARIVARI.
and who, out of respect for the country in which they were born, are
very fond of the paint, and not at all partial to clothes.
As for the religion of the ancient Britons, as it was a false and
abominable superstition, the less we say about it the better. If they
had a religion, you may be sure they had a clergy. This body of
persons were called Druids. The historian Hume says that they
instructed the youth of the country, which, considering not one boy
in 1,000,000,000,000 could read, couldn't give the Druids much trouble.
The Druids likewise superintended the law matters and government
of Britain ; and, in return for their kindness, were handsomely paid,
as all teachers of youth, lawyers, and ministers ought to be. (Hear,
hear, from Lord Abinger and Sir Robert Peel.)
The ancient Britons were of a warlike rude nature (and loved
broils and battles, like Master Spry yonder). They used to go forth
with clubs for weapons, and bulls' horns for trumpets; and so with their
clubs and trumps they would engage their enemies, who sometimes
conquered them, and sometimes were conquered by them, according
to luck.
The priests remained at home and encouraged them ; praying to
their gods, and longing no doubt for a share of the glory and danger;
but they learned, they said, to sacrifice themselves for the public
good. Nor did they only sacrifice themselves—I grieve to say that
it was their custom to sacrifice other people : for when the Britons
returned from war with their prisoners, the priests carried the latter
into certain mysterious groves, where they slew them on the horrid
altars of their gods. The gods, they said, delighted in these forests
and these dreadful human sacrifices, and you will better remember
the facts by representing these gods to you as so many wicked Love-
groves, and their victims as unfortunate Whitebait.
[Immense sensation.
And as your papas have probably taken some of you to see the
Opera of Norma, which relates to these very Druids that we º
talking about, you will know that the ancient Britons had not only
priests, but priestesses—that is, clergy women. Remember this,
and don't commit an error which is common in society, and talk of
two clerical gentlemen as two priestesses. It is a gross blunder. One
might as well speak of the Blue Posteses (in Cork Street, Burlington
Gardens, where, I am told, excellent beef steaks are served), or talk
of having your breakfasteses, as I have heard the Duchess of
often do. Remember then, Priests, singular Priest. ‘Blue Post,
(Cork Street, Burlington Gardens), singular—Blue Post. ‘Break-
fasts, singular—What is the singular of Breakfasts, Miss Higgins
Miss Higgins. I don't know.
Master Smith, (delighted and eager). I know.
Miss Tickletoby. Speak, my dear, and tell that inattentive Miss
Higgins what is the singular of “breakfasts.”
Master Smith (clearing his voice by rubbing his jacket sleeve across
his nose). The most singular breakfast I know, is old John Wap-
shot's, who puts sugar in his muffins, and takes salt in his tea :
(Master Smith was preparing to ascend to the head of the class, but
was sternly checked by Miss Tickletoby, who resumed her dis-
course.)
It was not to be supposed that the wickedness of these Priests
could continue for ever: and accordingly we find, (though upon my
word I don't know upon what authority), that, eighteen hundred and
ninety-seven years ago, Julius Caesar, that celebrated military man,
landed at Deal. He conquered a great number of princes with jaw-
breaking names, as did the Roman Emperors, his successors, such as
the Trinobantes, the Atrebates, the Silures, all richly deserving their
fate, doubtless, as I fear they were but savages at best. They were
masters of the Britons for pretty near five hundred years, and though
the Scotch pretend that the Romans never conquered their part of it,
I am inclined to suppose it was pretty much for the reasons that the
clothes are not taken off a scare-crow in the fields, because they are
not worth the taking.
About the year 450, the Romans, having quite enough to do at
home, quitted Britain for good, when the Scots, who were hungry
then, and have been hungry ever since, rushed in among the poor
unprotected Britoners, who were forced to call the Saxons to their
aid.
'Twas two o'clock—the Lecturer made her curtsey and reminded
her auditory that another Lecture would take place on the following
Wednesday, and the company departed, each making a mental
affidavit to return.
THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON IDLER.
II. THE REGENT-STREET Lou NgER.
AFTER the unceasing labours of Linnaeus, Buffon, Cuvier, Shaw,
and all the other animal-fanciers on an extensive scale, had sur-
mounted the apparently impossible task of marshalling all the earth's
living curiosities into literary rank and file, a worthy old parson at
some out-of-the-way little village in Hampshire put together his
observations on the Natural History of Selborne. Like the great
gems just mentioned, a crowd of deep thinkers from Plato down-
wards, have defined man in general, and, in like manner to Gilbert
White, do we follow in our description of man in particular, and
thus define our specimen :-Class; Mammalia. Order; Man. Genus;
Idler. Species; Londoner. These we shall subdivide according to
our own taste, and we will first mention the Regent-street Lounger.
As soon as the season has fairly commenced—when the first warm
afternoon in May tempts the delicate flowers of aristocracy from
their domestic conservatories, and turns the West-end into a whirl
of dust, dash, and driving, and the carriages stand along the curb of
the pavement in double rows, like the lines of a race-course; when the
bright planets rise at the opera, and attract a crowd of brilliant satel-
lites around them; when attentive young gentlemen purchase bouquets
for their innamoratas at something under a guinea a-piece, and philan-
dering young ladies throw out dark hints respecting the probability
of their appearance at the next Horticultural mob at Chiswick; when
economical daughters with small allowances wear themselves to
thread-papers, in endeavouring to find out by what sort of harle-
quinade they can turn a last year's mantelet into a this year's pelerine;
and extravagant sons quite frighten their mothers by the accumula-
tion of dirty-white kid gloves discovered in the drawer of their
dressing-table: at this time the loungers appear in Regent-street.
We believe it has never yet been ascertained for a certainty where
the Regent-street loungers live when they are at home. They affect
the neighbourhood of the West-end generally, and sometimes give
their day address at a club ; but beyond this we can give no clue to
their domiciles, for some of these gay loiterers reside in localities
only known to tax-collectors, election canvassers, water-rate men,
and people who engrave maps of London. And wonderfully dazzling
are they in the sunshine; but on the approach of wet weather, they
disappear to their mysterious abodes in the same unaccountable
manner as their prototypes, the butterflies. We say unaccountable

because, although we have paid deep attention to the subject, we
never could make out where the butterflies go to, or what they do,
on wet days; no more than we could solve another enigma of equal
obscurity—viz., what has become of all the pins.
Men of enterprising spirit, who have contrived to increase the
penetralia of the lounger's home, affirm that his toilet when there,
partakes more of the Costume du Queen's Bench, than the dashing ap-
pearance which it assumes in the streets. There, the blouse or
dressing-gown with seedy elbows, and the slippers formed of boots
cut down, are the favourite articles; whilst the worked satin scarf
yields to a Spanish cloth stock, or more probably none at all : for the
incomes of those would-be men about Town are exceedingly limited,
Why will the half-farthings be issued 2–Because Queen Victoria has given her
countenance to the design.
Why won't the half-farthings be issued 2–Because Queen Victoria has set her face
against them.

III.-The HAUNTS OF THE REG ENT-STREET Loun GER. * Beang.”
As we wish our Physiology to be strictly English, we cannot make 9. the dialogue may go on thus:— - -
particular mention of the foreigners who saunter along the trottoir Garsong—donnay moi un petit tass du cafayet un peu de l'eau de
of Regent-street; but the nearest approach to them is— vie-par beaucoup.” -
“Oui, monsieur: une d'mie tasse et un p't'rerre.”
“Et une papier des nouvelles.”
“Platt-il, monsieur º’”
(Lou DER) “Une papier—des nouveautés—comprenay voo !”
“Oui, monsieur.”
The waiter departs, and not exactly understanding that the visitor
means a newspaper, brings him a paper of bonbons.
But when the journal is procured, and the same “garsong” says to
him, “I will take zat paper after you, sare, if you please,” he begins
to think that he might just as well have spoken English, and feels as
we did on our first visit to Boulogne (to which place we crossed one day
from Ramsgate to say we had been to France, and on which account
we have affected to call it Bou-loyne ever since), when having sum-
moned up courage to plunge into the pastrycook's shop at the corner
of the Rue Neuve Chaussée, and address the young lady therein pre-
siding with “Avez-vous de l’eau de soda f" received as a reply:—
| “Oh, yes, sir, plenty of soda-water.”
The pleasures of the Regent-street lounger are attained at a very
small outlay of capital. He loves the shop-windows, looking upon
them as gratuitous exhibitions of curious articles, and thinks that
Ackermann, Fores, Stocken, and other card-case and caricature mer-
- - - - - - | chants, deserve a piece of plate from the loungers (if they could only
and, having returned in safety, goes any lengths to gratify, his am-' afford the subscription) in return for the very cheap amusement
bition of being thought a Frenchman. He inclines to a shady frºck which their establishments offer. And we may here observe that the
coat of napless cloth, with a collar of half an inch, in depth; light, Taglioni, in spite of its alleged resemblance to a coal-sack fitted up
cloth brodequins, with patent leather tips; grey pantaloons puckered with buttons and sleeves, is an article of dress which must have been
in at the waist, and fitting as closely to the boots as a coloured stock- invented expressly for these loungers. Thrusting their hands and
ing with the toes cut off; and a fifteen-franc velvet hat. His hair half their little walking-sticks into the front slanting pockets, up to

being withdrawn from the beautiful gipsy by two portraits of mortal

window, and the second combing her hair at the other. He peers
into all the artificial flower-shops, to see what hidden divinities are
therein concealed by the bowers of tinted gauze and tinsel; and hav-

The Regent-street lounger invariably gets on better by himself
than with a companion. Few men are born with precisely the same
taste; they may like one pursuit in common with each other, but they
will differ in twenty. The lounger, for instance, is a keenly-suscep-
tible admirer of female loveliness—he cannot keep his eyes from the |
pretty women in the carriages, whilst his friend cares for nothing but
the horses, and somewhat scandalises the other's meditations by intrud-
ing occasional remarks about their (the horses') broad chests and fine
action. The lounger likes to inspect the articles in a jeweller's shop, and
make imaginary purchases of any indefinite number of pins and studs
he may have set his mind upon ; whilst his friend falls in raptures at
every gun-maker's he passes, and will not be drawn away until he has
descanted upon the merits of every piece in the window, down to the
seven-barreled pistols. The lounger likes to walk across the road
with becoming ease and indifference to the vehicles—his friend rushes
over as if a mail train was coming down upon him. In fact, should
the lounger run the risk of being saddled with a friend, it is always
best to have some ready excuse for shirking him constantly at his
finger's ends. In answer to the fatal question “which way are you
going, because I'll walk with you ?” the lounger knows it is useless to
give a literal reply, because these annoying acquaintances always
chance to be progressing in exactly the same direction. He had
better say that he is going nowhere in particular, but waiting to keep
an appointment with a lady. If the friend has any delicacy he will
retire ; if not, he must be cut—henceforth and for ever.
mence their conjurations. If you look in a dictionary for a meaning
to the word, you will find it designated “the organ of sight”—a vilely
meagre definition; implying that its use is simply visual, as if it had
nothing to do with flirtation. Why, even my excellent friend Pel-
ham Plumer—the precise, punctilious clerk in Her Majesty's Trea-
sury—knows better. It was, if I understand him rightly, when the
buds were first peeping forth upon the trees of the Russell-square
inclosure, (a key whereof he had just purchased), that he first be-
came aware that eyes were made for other uses than mere seeing.
The pair from which he learnt the lesson are, according to his ac-
count—bright, lustrous, and blue. They belong to a charming face,
shine under a very “love” of a garden bonnet every morning,
exactly half an hour before breakfast, and, next to them, Pelham
loves punctuality. The first encounter happened whilst he was
sitting in the round seat under the great tree. He was putting on a
new pair of gloves, and mentally cursing the one thread that pre-
tended to fasten the wrist-button, when he beheld the blue orbits.
They were taking a general view of his person—a periscope from
under a parasol. They gradually travelled from his boots to his hat,
and called up a smile ; they then rested upon the embarrassing
glove-button, and invoked a frown. Plumer was paralysed, for he
translated the smile into an approval of his person, and the frown
into sympathy with his mishap. He never saw such a lovely figure
—one at least that stood sitting so well—nor such a tasteful morning
robe—nor such pretty feet—nor such a tiny parasol. He stared, and
the lady would have hid her face had her sun-fan been big enough,
so she turned away her head, and pretended to watch with earnest-
THE NATURAL HISTORY OF COURTSHIP. A mes, the gardener, as he swept past with a broom. The back-view
CHAPTER II.--THE IMPLEMENTs of Countship.
WHEN the gods decreed, as per last chapter, that Courtship should
be numbered amongst the fine arts, they presented us with the
necessary implements—that the making of love, like the making of
barley-sugar or gunpowder, might be duly carried on, secundum
artem, by machinery. Brunel would be nobody without his pistons
and cogs. Apelles would never have been heard of but for his
pencil. What was Phidias without his chisel ? and not the labora-
tory of the chemist, nor the ateliers of the mechanist, contain instru-
ments of such varied, complicated, delicate construction, as those
employed by the true artist in love.
To mention only a few of the articles in a lover's laboratory:—
the eyes to glance, a purse to bribe Abigails and to make presents,
the hands to “press” and to write notes with, the brains (though not
absolutely essential) to spin into verses, the lips as ingredients in a
smile, the lungs for sighing, the tongue for fibbing (“at lovers' per-
juries, &c. &c.”), the feet and a few lessons from D'Egville, for
waltzing; besides a hundred others, many of which are not even
mentioned by Ovid.
thus presented was perfectly enchanting. What an elegantly-turned
figure : What a sylph-like waist Plumer took this opportunity of
arranging his cravat.
Again those blue eyes shone upon the hemisphere of his attrac-
|tions. Half closed, they at first peered with curiosity—then opened
with surprise—and called up the sweetest tinge of shame that ever
deepened the tint of a lovely cheek. Plumer was right in rendering
these motions and emotions into English thus:—“I wonder if he is
gone yet ! As I live he is still looking this way ! Good gracious ! how
| very odd he must think me !”
Thereupon the lady rises, and the gentleman follows her—but only
with his eyes. At a turn of the walk she again looks round. One
short, twinkling, but decisive glance is exchanged, and Mr. Plumer
rushes to the square-keeper, and promising him a handsome reward
if he will divulge who the lady with the pale pink bonnet and infini-
tesimal parasol may happen to be. The answer is, “Miss Murray, of
|Number 96, in the Square;” and the rejoinder, a half-crown.
Mr. Plumer's destiny from that morning was settled. For the first
|time since “taking office” he was fined for being late, and when the
blue eyes were innocently mentioned as the cause thereof, those
enchanting orbits were vilely coupled by his doubting fellow-clerks,
with a lady well-known as “Betty Martin.” Still, Pelham—not having
the fear of the clerk of the cheque before him—continued to visit the
interior of the Square at the time of trysting, and thus a silent tele-
graphic courtship was established, solely by two pairs of eyes. The
staid Plumer now became another man, and actually went to a fancy
ball dressed as a French Chasseur.
Let us begin with the EYEs—for with them lovers invariably com-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Let me here mention a few other important elements in the
science. Compli MENTs are most difficult tools to handle ; for
all women are most particular in assuring us that they abhor
flattery. Hence, if you cannot manage to bring your compliments
within the pale of their implicit belief, you had better not use them.
As skilful anglers proportion the size of the hook to the fish's capacity
for swallowing, so the clever courtier must measure his flattery by
the known amount of the recipient's vanity. To be sure, this is
sometimes incalculable, as I believed Julia Summers's to be, when I
thought no extravagance of praise applied to her personale would be
too great for her credence. But I was mistaken. I happened, (it
was at a Champagne pic-nic, and that must be my excuse), to make
some outrageous allusion to the planetary system in connection with
her eyes; forgetting, alas! at the moment, how awfully she squints.
Unluckily she knew I was quizzing her, and never forgave me, which
I have repeatedly regretted, for she possesses as pretty a fortune as a
professor of courtship would wish to wed withal.
Neither should the best deserved compliment be directed point-
blank, even from the glibbest beau, but wafted to the ears of the belle
upon the insinuating zephyrs of a puff-oblique. It should be adroitly
implied, and not directly paid—“ duly as the Turk's tribute,”—but let
fall by apparent accident. If, however, an evidence of intention be
unavoidable, let the honied words drop from your lips as though you
really could not help it. Should you, by mistake, address a sensible
woman, truly conscious of what is due to her in the way of admira-
tion, she will laugh at you ; but laugh, too—be not mortified—and
never retract.
Again, of LovE LETTERs.-Above all things be very particular
about your stationery. I don't wish to drive you to the expense of
arabesque envelopes, gilded borders, or any of the mere fripperies of
papeterie; but let me assure you, that despair, be it ever so touch-
ingly expressed, looks anything but genuine upon shabby post; whilst
love, merely hinted at upon pink note, receives a tinge of reality
which no words can express. Always seal with your crest, (if you
have one—if not, get one “found" at your stationer's), and never use
those abominable mottoes which are sold in the bazaars by the
dozen.
There can be no doubt that the outside of a billet is of far greater
consequence than its contents, the which few women absolutely and
religiously believe. “Men,” it is their common axiom, “are deceivers
ever,” and rather than put faith in what we say upon paper, the dear
ones form their judgment from little accompanying circumstances; as
thus:—a crest, bespeaks good family; a neat envelope, gentlemanly
habits; the groom, whom you must always contrive shall be your
Mercury (whether he be your own or another's), hints a horse, and
some affluence. These points once established, the contents of your
note—in all cases where the charmer has passed her twenty-fifth
year—go for nothing. Should, however, your enchantress be in her
teens, they have their weight, but in that case some circumstances
of mysterious difficulty and romance must be added to the opera-
tion of delivering; to which end always bribe her maid, that your
winged messengers of love may occasionally fly in at a three-story
window, and fall exactly under your angel's dressing-case, or be
folded up somehow in her kerchief, or magically drop upon the
pavement when she opens her parasol. And here, too, what are the
contents —Nothing; for your cause is inwardly advocated by the
pouting beauty, thus—“How exceedingly impertinent—but then he
is so very persevering—I really must tell Mama to discharge
Flounce—to be sure he is not handsome, but then so affectionate”
—(the pink paper)—“and so well bred ”—(the crest).-“How shall
I act when I meet him at the Watertons' to night !”
How Why, in a manner that shall convince the lover he has
made one step in the fair one's favour.
For these reasons, I am convinced that the authors of the “Complete
Letter Writer” lay by far too much stress upon the interior of a billet
d'amour. Yet, as a matter of secondary importance, that demands a
remark or two. Be sure to invoke inspiration from Honour, and in
your first note make decided but delicate allusions to the true end
and aim of courtship. Be sparing of your imagination, and only use
it to heighten the feelings you really possess; never pretending to
emotions you are an entire stranger to. If you indulge in sentimen-
tality, let it not be—as you value a character for sanity—sickly or
maudlin. We are loved as men ; our sentiments and actions should
therefore be manly. Your style should be divested of all formality ;
never commence with “My dear Madam,” or “My dear Miss Watson;"
but plunge in medias res at once. I knew a worthy young attorney,
who lost a lovely, lively brunette, by addressing her as “Respected
Miss Gay.”
PREs EN 1s should be more tasteful than costly; apropos rather tha:
numerous. Visits must never be too prolonged, or without excuse;
to manufacture which, various plans may be adopted. Never, for
instance, separate at a party, or elsewhere, without a proposition
for the opera, or some sort of excursion, that you may call next
morning to get the arrangement ratified or rejected. Always forget
to return a handkerchief, lorg.nette, or scent-bottle on the evening
you may be indulged with their charge ; for that creates another
morning visit. -
Finally, the finishing implements are—(be not alarmed, dearest
prude, for I am not going to pen a physiology of kissing)—the lips 1
“What!” warmly asks my esteemed Priscilla, “and has the HEART
nothing to do with courtship !” -
“Nothing, my dear Madam ; for when that inmost temple of the
affections is entered, courtship and its arts have fled.”
FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. - -
OUR express in anticipation of the overland mail (brought in a flaming
red cab), from Hounslow, is full of news, which is nearly all of an unsatis-
factory character. The traders of the city had been detected in using
short weights, and a number of them had been solemnly condemned in
the presence of the proper officer.
The news from the Heath is still gloomy, and it is as barren as usual of
all interest. A tribe had lately passed over it with a caravan, and had
been seen to halt on the way, and to light a beacon fire, on the top of
which our informant had distinctly seen a kettle and a set of

Firr-irto Ns.
Our correspondent gives a graphic description of the position taken up
by the wandering tribe, and gives a pleasing anecdote connected with the
turning loose of a horse to “fatten on the rich pastures of the verdure-
clad heath,” but we have no room for extracts,

The editor of The Morning Post—who, when very loyal, writes as the

carriage might pass over them, as the car of Juggernaut did over the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DIET OF DEBT |
DEBT is to be stripped of its dignity, and is henceforth to stand before
the world in all its pauper ugliness. The Queen's Prison Act destroys
all the romance of credit, and the man who owes money is to be
dealt with as a mere prosaic wickedness; henceforth, from the
Queen's Bench to the Penitentiary, how short the step ! It is thus
the poetry of life is plucked and plucked at by the horny fingers
of Utility—it is thus every gay, though draggled feather, that
covered its nakedness, is torn relentlessly away—and Life has be-
come a poor nude groundling, naked as a poulterer's capon.
We confess to a rising feeling of resentment, as we struggled
through a perusal of the regulations that are, henceforth, to assimilate
what was once the region of good-fellowship to the dreariness of La
Trappe . In the first place there is to be no wine allowed / No wine
allowed in Her Majesty's own gaol I We have called before our
mind's eye the cordial face of our heroic little Queen, and sure we
are, this sordid, bloodless clause must have cost her many a pang ere
she assented to it. The Bench forbidden to Bacchus ! when, here-
tofore, his jolliness, poorly disguised beneath the husky outside of a
doorkeeper, was wont to stand in the inner lobby, and with a roguish
twinkle of the eye, seem to invite the calling friend to crack a bottle
—yea, or two—with the melancholy captive And now, bottles con-
secrated to the grape are forbidden things. What a change :
Imagine the self-same doorkeeper, whose key, to the eye of the
imaginative visitor, looked a little thyrsus, imagine the purple hos-
pitality now shrunk and faded, and challenging every vessel that
passes the gate, and with starveling nose—like the storks that asked
the fox to dinner—thrust down every bottle to snuff the odour of
prohibited grape . To be sure we are not altogether without hope :
the very severity of the restriction may give a healthy fillip to the
genius of smuggling; we acknowledge a renewal of spirit from our
faith in contraband.
Another regulation applies to roast and boiled. Care is to be taken
—so runs the sneaking hypocrisy of the new rules—that debtors do
not waste what is due to the creditor in expensive feasting. Who is
to define expensiveness? A Poor-Law Commissioner, for instance,
might refuse a second onion to the bread and cheese of the epicurean
debtor, deeming two onions the luxury of a Lucullus, and that only
allowed when he sees company in the Apollo. Over-quantity, or
what may be considered over-quantity, comes under the head of
undue outlay ; therefore shall we have an authorised officer weighing
every collop of rump-steak as though he was weighing light sove-
reigns—or, rather, like a Queen's Bench Shylock curiously balancing
the bleeding flesh of every debtor. Again, will it not be a nice cal-
culation justly to consider the capabilities of every incarcerated sto-
mach May not the duty be entrusted to an illiterate officer, ignorant
of the fact that men, like turkeys, cram most when most confined
However, say that a proper quantity of rump-steak passes the
appointed censor; let it be taken for granted that the leg of mutton
allowed to “6 in 14" is all-sufficient for the tenants therein abiding;
Joint stock.
how then, fare those nameless graces of life—those little amenities of
the board that redeem mere eating from its grossness, and cast a some-
thing like poetry about the mortal necessities of the table We at
once avow it; we mean oyster-sauce. Nay, we will also confess to
capers, currant-jelly; yea, to the whole delightful family of condi-
ments. Shall every leg of mutton, casting up its melancholy pope's-
eye, read inscribed on the Queen's Bench gate—
“Leave off all capers, ye who enter here?"
Will the affected humanity of the new law, careful lest it draw un
necessary tears to the eyes of the debtor, deny to him the dinner-visit
of horse-radish : Shall not even mustard be “hot in the mouth "
There is likewise to be the ignominy of classification. Men are
not, as heretofore, to meet on the broad and pleasant ground of debt—
that sweet neutral spot of life, where the dwellers were wont to cast
aside the ceremonies and petty pride of the outer world, and where
was to be seen the gay gallant of former thousands, in morning-gown
and slippers, lounging familiarly with the modest captive, prisoner
for three pounds ten. The man who has twice tested the benevolence
of the laws of credit is now no longer to play atrackets with the debtor
caged for the first time. Extravagance and misfortune are conta-
gious; hence, captivity is to be classified
Woman, too, who, like a sweet Sister of Charity, was wont to tend
the bruised heart of imprisonment, she, too, either as captive or as
visitor, is no longer to cheer her brothers in affliction. If a debtor,
she is, like a nun, to dwell apart. If she would pay a compassionate
visit, it must be at angelic intervals, and of angelic duration—few and
short. And children, who were occasionally brought to climb the
knees of the imprisoned father, and watch the salutary effect of
English law in his wasting cheek and whitening hair—they are no
longer to take such early lessons within the Bench, but—if at all—
to study legal benevolence outside the walls.
Most vigilantly will work the spirit of classification. The debtor
who has ruined three tailors will have his peculiar cell. The crimi-
nal who, at only 60 per cent., has betrayed the confidence of a money-
lending Samaritan, will be disciplined with a severity proportioned
to his crime.
Making ADVANCEs.
A prison costume is, we understand, in contemplation: a dress
made of white flannel, with red and blue stripes down and
across it, like a ledger; while the amount of the prisoner's detainers
will be embroidered in each collar, in black worsted. If remanded
from the Insolvent's Court, it is proposed to burn the figure in each
cheek of the offender.
Whitecross-street, the Fleet, and other prisons, are to empty them-
selves into the Queen's Bench. Soon, full soon, the Fleet, with all
the wild romance of other days, will have vanished 1 All its feathered
gallants, its brocaded dames, its most convenient parsons—all have
long since been a matter of legend : yet still was spared, to the re-
flecting humanity of our day, the grizzled head and furrowed face of
some wretched, croaking, groaning suppliant, who stood in penury as
in deepest crime, and through iron bars, begged his fellow-man to
“remember the poor debtor,” caged like a beast, because the beast
was—poor The perfection of human reason dived its hand in the
pocket of the debtor, and finding nothing there, locked him up, that
some benevolent “night-tripping fairy” might fill the said pocket
with coined pieces.
We have a great respect for this spirit of reform bustling at the
present moment in the Queen's Bench. We could, however, wish
that the said spirit, leaving for a time the wine-bottles and the legs
of mutton of the debtor, would begin at the right end of the evil. It
is well that the wastefulness of Debt should not drink its wine from
the cellars of Credit—should not despoil the honesty of Trade of the
profits of its mutton ; but whilst we institute a most temperate
dietary for Debt, why not put Law upon a lessened allowance?
“You shall not drink the blood, you shall not feed upon the flesh of
the creditor,” says Reform to the prisoner. Now, what we want
Reform to add is, “And you, Law, shall take fewer mouthfuls from
the substance of the debtor.” Let Law Expense have a lower diet
as well as Debt; at present, what are the £. s. d. of Law but snakes
strangling and devouring the debtor—the miserable Laocoon of
modern days? Q.
THE LIGHT SOWEREIGNS.
The reason why those sovereigns are light that have St. George upon
the reverse, is understood to be this:—they have become very naturally
sweated by the warm work that the Champion of England is having with
the dragon.
DöBLER'S MAGIC.
The phenomenon of the candles, performed by Herr Dübler, at the St.
James's Theatre, is supposed to be the result of a private understanding
between the Herr and the wicked one !

DRAMATIC COMMONPLACES.
OR THY MASTER
PUNCH. — I do come
forward once more fur-
ther to set forth and ex-
= pose the exceeding vanity,
*E nothingness, and futility,
of the generality of our
stage-plays, more espe-
cialy of such plays as be
perversely called excel-

Sir, I do maintain that
such sort of stage-plays
as I have in view, far from
diffusing any real right-
eousness and practical good, do rather teach and encourage a kind of
mouth-morality and hypocritical cant, so that he who hath no good-
ness in his heart, but is a veritable child of Belial, may discourse
glibly in such strain as shall seem to the multitude of excellent

savour. Verily such phrases be but the flowers that do spring from |
filthiness. And though by a long and painful experience, I am
well aware that the multitude is generally deceived by a false glitter,
yet have even I marvelled greatly, when he that hath but a small
and worthless wit, hath, by the introduction of what are pleasantly
called “sentiments,” with a lavish hand, raised such a tumult of
applause as to bring about the belief that his work hath proved
successful.
However, as there be some who think such sentences are highly
profitable, I have taken the pains to collect and classify the amount
of moral wisdom which is to be found in the divers works of our
modern makers of stage-plays, that my fellow-citizens may read them
over at once, and save themselves the trouble of going to play-
houses, and if they find any wisdom in such phrases as I have
collected, well and good; if not, why, then, they do agree with me.
At all events they need not go to the playhouse to seek it, as, for a
little good, it were well to avoid so large a measure of temptation and
contact with uncleanness.
Of my collection, I have sent yeu a few specimens, which I can
increase at pleasure, placing before the sentences of each class, the
kind of stage-player who doth habitually utter them.

fashionable Hudſºn't.
ONE of the most pleasing réunions of the season assembled last week at
the matinée of Mr. W. in Bow-street. The doors were thrown open
at the usual hour, when a numerous party filled the spacious salon, and .
Mr. Minshull received his visitors on the celebrated arm-chair used by
Sir Frederick Roe on the examination of the Burkers. Mr. Minshull was
attended by the usual officers; and Mr. Burnaby, who wore the insignia
of his office (including the collar of purity and the white ducks of the
Order of St. Monmouth), was in attendance with the pen of Justice and
the inkstand of Integrity. Inspector Toddledown was also present with
the staff of Strictness, which he brandished very gracefully from time to
time; and several policemen, all wearing the hat of blackness, were
scattered over the hall of audience.
In the course of the entertainment, the following Tableaux were ex-
hibited, which excited a very considerable interest :-
Tableau the first.—Snooks, a Greenwich pensioner, fined Five Shillings
for Drunkenness.
PROFUSELY Drcon Atkd with cuts.
Tableau the second.—Smith swearing to the loss of a pawnbroker's
duplicate.
Tableau the third.—Sarah preferring a charge of assault against her
husband, Jacob.
Tableau the fourth.-The Lion's Mouth and the Giant's Staircase ; or,
Jones confronted with the knocker, wrenched by himself from the door
at the top of the high steps in the Adelphi.
Wi |
taken in the Act.
The whole of the Tableaur were beautifully done, and in the last the
look of agony thrown by Jones at the accusing knocker, which, of course,
maintained its cold and death-like rigidity, was one of the finest things
ever witnessed. Mr. Minshull himself was so struck with the effect that
he promised a repetition of the scene, and, in official language, ordered a
remand, with a view to an encore of the very interesting Tableau.
Several of the party left the place by the ordinary route, but a few were
accommodated with a covered conveyance, driven by an officer in a
blue livery, turned up with white letters, and quitted the spot by a sepa-
rate doorway.

ADVANCEMENT OF EVERYTHING IN GENERAL,
AND NOTHING IN PARTICULAR.
THIs enlightened Society is still brandishing the torch of science
in the eyes of a flabbergasted world; and we are happy to say, that
the wick of the said torch, which had been getting rather lengthy,
was so effectually snuffed by our notice of last week, that a most
refreshing flare-up has been the salubrious consequence. The Mem-
bers of the Association were so delighted with our report, that they
sent a special invitation, to Fräulein, Judy and Her (r) Punch, who
have attended all the subsequent meetings that have been held, and
who now furnish, from their joint-notes, the following particulars.

INFort Mation -on-T-lº. People.
When the accounts were brought before the Association, it was
found that the following was among the items:— -
For watching the meteorometer £10 0 0
For repairing the meteorometer . - - 15 15 0
Her (r) Punch begged to remark upon this item, that the object of
watching the meteorometer was probably to take care of it; and if,
after all, there were fifteen guineas to be paid for repairs, the watch-
ing must have been of the most inefficient description. He, there-
fore, begged to propose that the ten pounds for watching should be
disallowed. (Hear, hear.)
Professor Sniveldrivel begged to propose, as an amendment, that
the fifteen guineas for repairs should be deducted from the ten pounds
for watching, and this resolution having been carried, it was referred
to the Mathematical Section D. to calculate the difference between
15 guineas and 200 shillings in the latter's favour. Another item in
the accounts was, several hundred pounds for coloured drawings of
sectional cuttings, which brought Professor Smugemoff on his legs,
who wanted to know what a sectional cutting meant; and whether
Professor Whewell, in taking himself off from the Association alto-
gether, and thus cutting all the sections at once, had achieved a sec-
tional cutting.
Professor Leadenbrains did not know ; and several other members
begged to say they could give no explanation.
Her(r) Punch had observed that a large sum was charged for cer-
tain drawings, and a still larger sum for correcting the errors in the
drawings alluded to. He only wished an explanation. (Hear.)
The Secretary observed that as Her(r) Punch had asked for an ex-
planation only, he (the Secretary) could only say that an explana-
tion was the only thing which he (the Secretary) was quite unable
to offer.
a Down Y ONE.
Her(r) Punch expressed himself perfectly satisfied, if the members
were content. He would, however, like to know how it was that
several pounds were put down for extending meteorological observa-
tions, and so many more pounds for reducing them. This, he thought,
was like paying a carpenter to cut off a piece from the bottom of a
ladder, and join it on at the top. (Hear, hear, followed by ories of
“Where, where,” from sereral of the members./
The Secretary had the same answer to give to this question that
he at first offered to the other, and he believed he was only repre-
senting the Association most faithfully when he solemnly declared,
in their name, that he knew nothing.
THE Excursion.
It having been resolved that the Association should take an excur-
sion somewhere, the proprietors of a coal-hole liberally threw it open
to them, and at an early hour the bulk of the Association had col-
lected at the mouth of the place alluded to. The party proceeded
slowly down some wooden steps, and as the descent was tardy, a
committee was appointed to sit upon the steps, which was accord-
ingly done, and the result was a very speedy Report, in which
some very subtle distinctions were drawn between deal-boards
and horse-hair chair cushions. The Association at length reached
the entrance of the coal-hole, and Professor Slowcoach read a
long paper on the ordinary hinge as applied to common doors, which
was interspersed with a few desultory observations on key-holes.
Having gained the interior, a very curious phenomenon became sud-
denly visible. A round opening appeared to be formed in the roof,
and a sound something resembling the human voice was heard to
pronounce the word “Be—low,” when a black carbonaceous sub-
stance descended in a circular shower, which had no sooner ceased
than a strong ray of light gushed down the aperture. This extraor-
dinary phenomenon occurred no less than twelve times, and a large
black heap (in a conical form) was immediately afterwards observed
in the centre of the place, when some of the most enterprising
members of the Association closed round it and proceeded to make
experiments.
Professor Paradiddle was the first to approach the extraordinary
mass, and placing his foot upon the lower portion of it, he found that
it in some degree yielded to external pressure, and that each inden-
tation was followed by a descent of some of the upper portion; and,
lastly, by that of himself. On rising, he looked like a nigger who had

A good deal of general conversation then ensued, and the Associa-

LINES WRITTEN BY A BEDRIDDEN BARD.
BRight Summer! bright Summer, thy smiling hours
Wake from the carth her sleeping flowers;
Beautiful are they to smell and sight,
Like the types of a land more fair and bright;
And grateful 's the warmth that thy sunbeams shed—
Except when they're roasting a fellow in bed.
Music sweet Music' to Fancy's ear
Thou seem'st a voice from some happier sphere,
Where Beauty fades not, and Grief 's unknown,
Where Love unchanging through time lives on ;
Music, sweet Music, I love thee well—
but that duo, an organ and dustman's bell.
The golden fruits that the Autumn brings
Are they not all most beautiful things?
Bacchus was born whilst Autumn reigned,
And bursting grapes were the breasts he diala'd.
Of the purple current he loved to cram—
But not when 'twas made into powder and jam.
0, precious is Rest to the worn and spent,
Unstringing the bow that was long unbent.
Flowers, and all that is fair and bright,
The loveliest seem in the dawning light.
O, Rest glads the joyous, and soothes the wretch-
But it's rather too much three months at a stretch.

A REVIEW OF THE BOOK OF THE SEASON.
HAD Sir Isaac Newton’s “Principia,” Bacon’s “ Novum Organum,”
Locke’s “Essay on the Human Understanding,” Homer's “Iliad,”
Adam Smith's “Wealth of Nations,” or S ’s first edition of his
Plays appeared in our time, Punch might have violated the rule that he
has laid down for himself respecting the expression of any opinion of the
merits of new works, and condescended to have recommended them in true
critical phraseology as “worthy of a place in every library.”
A work of equal importance to the happiness and enlightenment of the
present and future generations has recently issued from the press, under
the title of “A Shilling's Worth of Nonsense”,” and of which we ourselves
are the authors.
As this may be the only opportunity which we may ever have of review-
ing the effusions of our own pen (a gold one recently presented to us by a
devout admirer of our genius), we have no hesitation in going the whole
hog of ego- or rather nos-tism (see our racy remarks, page 64), and
declaring (as we have done, page 73) that “every father should purchase
our admirable little book for every son—every son for every father”—two
copies.
Were we to write volumes—nay, Encyclopaediae—we could not do
justice to this diamond edition of our wit and wisdom. The reader is
insensibly led grinning along the paths of knowledge, and (as we prefer
our metaphors mixed) finally brought up with a chuckle in the haven of
happiness. The task which we have set ourselves is a new one. We
have sought to turn the “whole duty of man” into a joke—to instruct the
ignorant by cachinnation—and to reclaim the erring with a guffaw. Need
we say that we have succeeded?
As there may be people in the world obtuse enough not to conceive the
possibility of effecting such a desirable purpose, we will dazzle our readers
with the following glimmer:–
* INTRODUCTION.
HE writers (geniuses) of this little
volume were standing some months
•ago on the quay at Dublin, atten-
tively observing a pig-driver per-
forming the arduous duty of em-
barking a herd of swine. They
(the geniuses) were much struck
with the process, evincing as it did
the drover's profound knowledge
of porcine nature, and his intimate
acquaintance with the principles of
Bacon. He (the drover) knowing
the perversity of pigs, cleverly con-
verted this unamiable trait in their
characters into an accommodating
virtue, for by pulling lustily at
their tails, and thereby implying
a wish to detain, the animal instantly
became impregnated with a desire to advance.
“The geniuses could not help admiring the philosophy of the pig-driver, and
were instantly impressed with the applicability of this contradictory process to
the education of the human species. They became convinced, that from the
proverbial pigheadedness of mankind, the only true method of inducing them to ||
go the right road was to urge them to pursue the wrong.
“Big with this great idea, the geniuses hastened home and commenced reducing
their new theory to practice.
“The first patient was an elderly aunt, with five hundred a year and an
asthma. One of the geniuses having the reversionary interest of her property,
naturally became particularly solicitous, lest she should venture abroad on rainy
days; and particularly urgent in imploring her to abstain from so doing. The
pig-philosophy prevailed. She would go shopping in a shower, and so got a
cold, a doctor, and—a hatchment.
“Miss Wild had a good figure, a large dowry, and a strong disliko to both of
the geniuses. They induced their mutual friends to urge Miss Wild not to
- Price Half-a-crown.
think of either of them for a husband. She heard their advice; and the pig-
philosophy again triumphed. Miss Wild listened to one of the geniuses
by moonlight, and in the morning rushed into his arms, a post-chaise, a d-
matrimony.
. . “With these proofs of the correctness of their theory, the geniuses have
jotted down a few hints upon general subjects adapted to the pig-headed
Portion of humanity; and in order to ensure for their work as large a sale as
Possible, they now, in accordance with their new philosophy, earnestly entreat no
one to purchase “A Shilling's Worth of Nonsense 1"
“AWARICE.
“Many ignorant people have stigmatised Avarice as a vice. This arose from
their blindly considering virtue and generosity as more honourable than wealth.
“Every person knows that respectability consists in a one-horse chaise; gen-
-
c------'
<
tility, in a chariot and job-horses; nobility, in a carriage, two footmen, a fat
coachman, and a hammer-cloth; all of which are the products of “a considerable
balance at the bankers’.” Now, Avarice being the high-road to the funds and
fame, it can but be looked upon as the noble ambition of an aspiring soul to
obtain the good opinion of his fellow-men.
“How glorions is the desire to die and leave behind us something better than a
good name l—something which will not only surround our death-bed with
anxious relations, but which, when we are no more, will make everything which
belonged to us lear to them—even our funded property; while those who enjoy
only a distant consanguinity will rush to Doctors' Commons and gladly expend
a shilling to satisfy themselves that our last requests have becn properly
attended to.
“There is also another benign consolation. The money which we have hoarded
and scraped together will become a golden ointment to the lacerated heart of our
“disconsolate widow.' It will be the means of destroying the solitude of her
hearth, and of filling our vacant chair with some sighing, sympathising singlo
gentleman.”
“ BENEVOLENCE.
Benevolence should be cultivated by every noble mind, as there is nothing
so conducive to permanent popularity as a proper exhibition of this enchanting
sentiment.
“A charity sermon is a fine stimulant to a benevolent mind. As the donation
which your generous feelings may prompt you to contribute is always received

-—-
at the church doors, this is undoubtedly one of the best methods of publishing to
your fellow-parishioners the humanity as well as the liberality of your disposi-
tion.
“We have heard of other advantages attendant upon this description of
alms-giving. Should any rascals have imposed upon you a half-crown which
is a native of the Minories and not of the Mint, a charity sermon will be found a
ready means of obtaining a good name, and getting rid of your bad money. You
need have no fears that the charity whose interests you are anxious to promote
would be any sufferer by the counterfeit which you have so liberally bestowed:
for, rest assured, it would again obtain a ready circulation, as no one could be
base enough to suspect that the trustees of a charity would ever dream of indulg-
ing in a little pious smashing.
“There is another admirable mode of giving vent to your benevolence. The
columns of a newspaper afford a fine opportunity for the exhibition of charitable
examples; whilst the publication of your name in conjunction with ten and six-
pence, not only tends to relieve the distressed and to stimulate the more sluggish
sympathies of others, but also to exalt yourself in the opinions of your fellow-
creatures. Giving alms in private is far from commendable; for every one must
be well aware of the social value of example; who, therefore, can be justified in
‘hiding his candle under a bushel ?’”
Reader, what do you think of that ? Take the inventor of the
steam-engine, and, compared to us, what's Watt Is Newton's
gravity to be named in the same universe with our levity We are
capital judges of such matters; and we say, decidedly not. To be
serious—this book really evinces a superior order of mind, and pro-
mises to do much for the trunkmakers and cheesemongers of future
generations.
THE HUNGERFORD SUSPENSION BRIDGE.
Another pile of this noble edifice that is to be (when it's done) has
been partially driven into the mud off Broadwood's brewery. The cere-
mony was completed amid the cheers of the three men who are constantly
employed on the work, and the greetings were loudly echoed by the
j hand who is stationed on the shore to watch the tools of the
carpenters.
We understand that the name of a Suspension Bridge has been given
to this splendid erection—that is to be—on account of the frequent sus-
pension to which the works are subjected.
At the last meeting of the proprietors of this magnificent structure,
it was proposed to pass a vote of thanks to Father #. for having
lately ceased to impede the works by intruding within the coffer, and
thus avoiding the necessity of keeping
ALL HANDS to thr PUMPs.
MESMERIC MIRACLES.
It was reported to the associated Association for the Encouragement of
Mesmeric Mummery, that Dr. Collyer had thrown a woman into such a
state that a tooth was extracted from her head without her knowing any-
thing about it. Professor Quizemall immediately brought under the
notice of the meeting the following case that had occurred under his own
eye as late as ...i. :-
He (the professor) had observed an individual to emerge from a public-
house, who was evidently under a strong mesmeric influence. He oscil-
lated considerably from side to side, and described various semi-circles,
his arms and legs forming as it were radii, of which his body appeared to
be the centre. He at length fell with great violence on the pavement, and
did not appear to suffer in the least, when a policeman began to manipulate
upon his collar, and made a few passes with a thick staff over the shins of
the patient, with the view most probably of disengaging the mesmeric
matter. The patient struggled a good deal, and he (the professor) might
mention as a parallel case to that of Dr. Collyer and the tooth, that the
mesmerised individual lost the whole of one skirt of his coat without
exhibiting any consciousness of the fact having happened.
A member wished to know how the case terminated. Professor
Quizemall had seen the patient the next day, when he was completely dis-
mesmerised, and was fully conscious of the loss of five shillings, taken
from him no doubt by way of experiment, though when under the
mesmeric influence he had lost several sovereigns without being in the
least aware of it.
K.C.B.
SIR PETER LAURir presents his compliments to Punch, and, having observed
“K.C.B." attached to the names of various noblemen, wishcs to learn if such letters
do not mean “Knights of the Cold Brandy-and-Water?”
3%lusical #ntelligentt.
A PUBLIC concert, purporting to be for the relief of distressed street
musicians, took place in Tottenham-court-road on Saturday evening last,
and, we are happy to state, was exceedingly well attended; especially the
reserved seats on the heap of paving-stones where they are repairing the
road ; and the stalls, all of which were occupied by their respective
owners.
Miss M. Wuggles created a sensation in the grand descriptive scena,
“The Congreve Lights,” and subsequent air, “The Last Box.” Mr.
Chaffey Baggs was encored in his new comic song of “I’ll tell you the
things what I don't like to see,” when, with his usual readiness, he gave
another, called “The single young Man Lodger.” We are requested to
state that these favourite songs are just published by Mr. Catnach. A
duet upon two piano organs by Signori Giuseppi Bruciani and Pietro Salvi
elicited º approbation, one playing “Jim, along Josy,” and the
other, “Do not .."; ;” with an obligato accompaniment on two pieces
of slate, by Master Fluffy Dick, the infant rattler. A fine solo, with a
catarrh accompaniment, by Mr. Joseph Downey, was eminently success-
ful; as well as Master Miffins, who performed a fantasia on an AEolian
ar, and a subsequent pot-pourri on the jew's-harp ; when young
‘Scratch, who presumed to express his disapprobation thereat, was im:
mediately bonneted and knocked into an umbrella of prints. Mr. Charley
Bates was to have appeared, but could not, being suddenly obliged to
leave home;—a notice to this effect was posted at the various police
stations.
Refreshments were supplied from Watchorn's retail establishment;
and the arrangement of the whole evening's performances were under the
direction of the F division.
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.
It is whispered that a celebrated performer on the dulcimer, who has
gained golden opinions at the various race-courses in the vicinity of the
metropolis, is about to make his appearance in the New Cut. Should this
be true, the lovers of harmony may prepare themselves for a rich treat.
We can contradict, upon authority, the report that Herr Staudigl is
engaged at the Cyder Cellars. It is also untrue, that Madame Grisi will,
upon recovery, take the principal parts in the operas at the Eagle Tavern.
MONSIEUR JULIEN,
A fellow that sticks at Nothing,
is hard at work bringing out the Stabat Mater waltzes, and Dead March
gallopade, for the ensuing Promenade Concerts. Our correspondent F.
is informed that we do not think Mr. Keeley ever played Fra Diavolo
or Elvino. We are also certain that Mr. W. Harrison is taller than
Mr. Grattan Cooke.
STATISTICS OF MENDICITY.
The Edinburgh Review proves to demonstration that begging is a very
profitable trade, and it is a curious fact that singing beggars make larger
sums than those who do not combine the profession of vocalist with the
trade of mendicant. We understand that since the introduction of Mr.
Mainzer's Singing for the Million, musical beggars have increased in the
ratio of three to one ; and it is a remarkable fact that the worse they sing
the better thing they are sure to make of it. Beggars with children get
much more than beggars with none; and when they hold up their offspring
as objects of compassion, they may be said, in legal phraseology, to plead
the general issue.

This little wretch is exciting the most intense interest, (Faugh 1) and we
have bribed the authorities in all directions to obtain information regarding
him.
It appears that Bean was the son of his mother, but we have been un-
able to get from either of the parents the exact date when the vagabond
was weaned, but we have drawn our own conclusions on the subject.
Since Bean has been in prison he has observed a sullen indifference,
but he continues to eat and drink with appetite.
It is a curious fact that when Policemen O. P. Q. asked him what could
induce him to fire at the Queen, he placed the end of his thumb on the
point of his nose; and as several boys have been observed to do the same
thing, it is very reasonably inferred that Bean belongs to some secret society,
of which the mystic symbol above described is one of the modes of com-
munication between the members of the fraternity. The policeman sought
an interview with Sir James Graham ; and on being asked by the home
secretary what he had to communicate, placed his thumb upon his nose,
which had rather an odd effect until an explanation was given. Sir J.
Graham remained some time in deliberation on the act reported by the
policeman, and it was resolved that a member of the British Association
should be called upon to give an interpretation of the mystic symbol.
The general opinion as to the punishment of Bean is, that a good thrash-
ing, which is often applied to vegetable Beans with effect, may be resorted
to in the case of this ordinary human Bean with the best result possible.
PUNCH2S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER. I.--THE BRIGHT POKER.
MY DEAR LITTLE Boy, So early as cock-crow this morning,
your dear mother reminded me that you were this day nine years
old. The intelligence delighted, yea, and saddened me. My sweet
little pet, you will think this strange : I will explain myself. When
I remembered that I was the author of a rational being, of a crea-
ture destined, it might be, to make a great noise in this world, and a
still greater in the next, my heart rose within me, and I was in a trans-
port of happiness. When, again, I reflected that I had given to the
earth an intelligent animal, doomed, perhaps, to continual fisticuffs
with fortune—marked, branded with poverty; sentenced to all the
varieties of the elements; a cold, hungry, houseless, haggard, squalid
piece of human offal—a thing with the hopes and aspirations of man,
now hardened by the injustice of the world to callous, calculating in-
sensibility, now stung into the activity of craft;-when I saw you
ed and despairing, an outcast in this life, and hopeless for—but
then I banished the picture from my brain. “Things,” I thus com-
muned with myself, “must not be thought of after this melancholy
fashion, otherwise little boys will become scarce.”
You are now, however, called upon to remember—for you are suf-
ficiently old to understand the obligation, and I shall therefore no
longer address you as a mere child—that to me you owe your life.
It is now nine years (metaphysicians would say something more) since
you opened a debtor account with me : an account never to be paid
off by laying down the principal, but to be duly acknowledged by
the punctual payment of interest in the shape of love, duty, and
obedience. Understand, you owe me your life: whether you were,
or were not, a party to the debt at the time it was contracted—
whether at my own whim and caprice I fixed upon you an obligation,
never in reality thinking of you at all, matters not : you are my
debtor, up to the present period, for nine springs, as many summers,
the like number of autumns, and not one less winter. Consider the
hold I have upon you—remember the debt that will be every year
increasing—and be docile, be obedient.

It is related of Saint Francis, that, being destitute of children, he
made to himself a family of snow-balls; and, that when made, he
gave to them pretty and endearing names, and took them in his
arms and hugged them to his bosom, and doubtless thought himself
quite a family man. Now, my dear child, as I am not a Saint

My affection, then, speaks for you in this, and shall be audible in

will enter upon that fearful struggle for the daily shoulder of mutton
—that terrible fight which every day shakes the earth to its founda-
tions—that never-ceasing squabble which, when Jove is melancholy
—for who shall say that Jove himself has not his megrims ?—makes
laughter for his majesty and his court assembled. How, then, to get
the best of the fray—how to secure the best cut of the shoulder
My son, give heed to a short story:—
The widow Muggeridge was the cleanliest of housewives. You
might, in vulgar phrase, have eaten your dinner off her floor; the
more especially as plates for two were never known upon her table.
Her household goods were a scrubbing-brush and scouring-paper.
She fairly washed the world from under the feet of her husband.
She insisted, as she worded it, upon his being nice and comfortable;
and therefore plentifully sluicing the sick man's chamber, as he lay,
knocked down by a fever, Muggeridge died of cold water and a
clean helpmate. When assured of her husband's death, it was the
touching regret of the new-made widow that he had not staid to
change his shirt. If any man ever took pleasure in his grave, it
must have been Muggeridge; for never since his marriage had he
known what it was to enjoy a piece of wholesome dirt.
And here, my dear child, let me advise you ; if it should be your
destiny to wed, and live in humble state, avoid by all means what is
called a clean wife. You will be made to endure the extreme of
misery, under the base, the invidious pretext of being rendered com-
fortable. Your house will be an ark tossed by continual floods.
You will never know what it is to properly accommodate your shoul-
ders to a shirt, so brief will be its visit to your back ere it again go
to the wash-tub. And then for spiders, fleas, and other household
insects, sent especially into our homesteads to awaken the enquiring
spirit of man, to at once humble his individual pride by the contem-
plation of their sagacity, and to elevate him by the frequent evidence
of the marvels of animal life, all these calls upon your higher
faculties will be wanting, and, lacking them, your immortal part will
be dizzied, stunned, by the monotony of the scrubbing-brush, and
poisoned, past the remedy of civet, by yellow soap ! Your wife and
children, too, will have their faces continually shining, like the
holiday saucers on the mantel-piece. Now, consider the conceit, the
worse than arrogance of this : the studied, callous forgetfulness of
the beginning of man. Did he not spring from the earth—from
clay—dirt—mould—mud—garden-soil, or compost of some sort; for
theological geology (you must look into the dictionary for these
words) has not precisely defined what ; and is it not the basest im-
pudence of pride to seek to wash, and scrub, and rub away the
original spot? Is he not the most natural man who, in vulgar mean-
ing, is the dirtiest Depend upon it, there is a fine natural religion
in dirt : and yet we see men and women strive to appear as if
they were compounded of the roses and lilies of Paradise,
instead of the fine rich loam that fed their roots. Be assured
of it, there is great piety in what the ignorant foolishly call filth.
Take some of the saints for an example. Off with their coats, and
away with their hair-shirts; and even then, my son, so intently have
they considered, and been influenced, by the lowly origin of man,
that with the most curious eye, and most delicate finger, you shall
not be able to tell where either saint or dirt begins or ends.
I have, however, been led from my immediate narrative

chapter Iv.—of THE PANTHEoN, considenED IN RELATIon To
THE Loungen.
The liberal person who threw open this bazaar as a pleasant cut,
in wet weather, from Oxford-street to Marlborough-street, conferred
a boon upon the Regent-street Loungers for which they cannot be
too grateful. It combines the attractions of the Zoological Gardens
and National Gallery, together with a condensed essence of all the
most entertaining shop-windows; and the passages between its coun-
ters, on the ground-floors, form a curious maze, or labyrinth, exceed-
ingly perplexing to novices anxious to arrive at the other end; whilst
the approaches abound in objects of interest to the lounger—the
most attractive one being the al fresco and gratuitous exhibition of
wax-work at the door of the tailor's opposite. The lounger is lost in
admiration of the fit of the coat which adorns the gentleman, and
wonders if his waist could possibly be made to look so small.
The majority of the loungers have a prevalent idea that wherever
they may be, they themselves form the chief points of attraction;
and hence they do not regard objects so much with the intention of
looking at them as with the notion that they are being looked at the
whiles. This is the reason why many of them incline to the chairs
against the pillars, in the gallery up-stairs, the possession of which
seats, they think, qualifies them for temporary men-about-town—a
term applied to those individuals who make themselves conspicuous
everywhere but in respectable private society; and from this exalted
situation they gaze upon the crowd below with the high bearing
which a person who has been fortunate enough to get an order for a
private box at the theatres assumes towards the occupiers of the pit.
It is generally supposed to be a variety of the same conceit that
induces people to give apples and buns to the elephants and bears at
the aforesaid Zoological Gardens. They do not care a straw whether
or no the animals are hungry; but the act of feeding elevates them
for a time above the throng of lookers-on, and makes them (as they
think) of importance.
Should there be any pretty girls behind the stalls—a circumstance
by no means uncommon at the Pantheon—the lounger frequently
passes backwards and forwards, to create animpression by his stylish
appearance; and whilst he is, to all appearance, minutely inspecting
with much interest the packets of soap and side-combs at a neigh-
bouring counter, he is inwardly thinking whether his trousers set
without twisting, and if his attitude shows off his figure to the
best advantage in the eyes of the admired one. We have stated that
the means of the lounger are limited, and, therefore, he does not lay
out much money at the emporiums. Admitting, however, that he
could occasionally make a few purchases, these would not much assist
his suit, since the most handsome marchandes appear attached to the
sale of feminine wares: and allowing his readiness and power to
buy, still babies' caps, habit-shirts, and worked collars, although
useful in the abstract, are not much in his line.
Perhaps the only thing which annoys him is the sudden appearance
of the stall-keepers at his elbow, as if waiting for an order, when he
stops to look over any amusing counter. This is a pantomimical way of
saying, “What do you wish to buy, sir?”—a refinement upon the com-
mon practice of less retiring young ladies who preside over the ginger-
bread-stalls at fairs, and who, with a shade more of delicate familiarity,
are wont to accost passers-by with the salutation, “Now, my dear,
let me put up a pound of these spice-nuts for you.” By the way, we
never correctly understood the exhibition of so much anxiety and
unflinching perseverance in the sale of what we always deemed an
exceedingly nasty compound of flour, dirt, and treacle.
The Conservatory is the portion of the Pantheon which the lounger
loves to frequent, next to the galleries. He is a walking price-
current of the rise and fall of the stocks—and other flowers; he
knows the value of the various bouquets, and the situation of the
rare plants; and he is upon terms of armost familiar acquaintance
with the cockatoos and gold-fish; indeed, his feeling towards the
tame macaw is one of real gratitude, for having so often attracted
the notice of old gentlemen inclined to zoology, who, solely occupied
with scratching the bird's poll, are unmindful of the flashing glances
their pretty daughters are throwing around, in the general sunshine
of which the delighted lounger participates—thinkino, even, that they
are meant for him alone.
Were we allowed to suggest an improvement, it would be that the
divan-looking apartment at the extremity ought to be converted into
a smoking-room; and, as he passes through it, to make a sortie into

Marlborough-street, he steals a momentary glimpse of his appearance
imposing carriage, that he may produce an effect upon the individuals
who usually occupy the seats “to see the company go in and out,”
for, in this little apartment, hall, passage, or whatever it may be
called, nice persons are as rarely to be met with as pretty girls in
omnibuses, or whitebait at Twickenham. The lounger used at one
time to stand in some little awe of the door-keepers, from his constant
visits, which, he thought, attracted their notice; but now they take
no heed of him, neither does the Lascar who sweeps the crossing,
who, finding his solicitations never replied to, has given the lounger
up as a bad job, and placed him, at once, on the free list.
THE NATURAL HISTORY OF COURTSHIP.
CHAPTER III.--THE RATIon ALE of MAtch-MAKING.
The genius who would indite a poem on Salisbury Plain, and
forget to mention Stonehenge—the manager who might cause “Ham-
let” to be performed, and inadvertently omit to bring forward the
Prince of Denmark—a Bréguet or a Barwise, who should turn a
watch out of hand in a state of exquisite completeness, all but the
main-spring—deserves, I am told, no greater ridicule than he who,
in particularising the “Implements of Courtship,” leaves out its
busiest agent; in many instances its primum mobile–Match-making,
Loveliest of censors, smooth thy frowning brow—sweeten the
bitter words which fall from thy lips I kiss—(nay, withdraw not
so suddenly )—the rod. I plead guilty. I did not mention the all-
important subject, knowing that it demanded an entire chapter; for
what the mathematics are to the exact sciences, so is Match-making to
Courtship.
FIRst on the list of match-makers is the undisguised professor of
the art, whom Fashion, borrowing a sly hint from Satire, has named
the “Chaperon”—that is to say, the hood, the blind, the blinker, the
masked-battery from behind which Beauty discharges her arrows.
She is, in most cases, a widow, having accumulated a large expe-
rience in love affairs during the “getting off” all her own daughters;
in which she has admirably succeeded. Match-making has conse-
quently become her passion—the grand excitement of existence—
what hazard is to the gamester. She cannot live without it, and
therefore becomes matrimonial agent to less experienced mothers,
who are blessed with daughters to be “provided for.”
Out of the legion of this class I could name, the Honourable Mrs.
in the looking-glass—of course by pure accident—and assumes an
and appear formed of nursery-governesses, old maids, and people |
from the country, conglomerated together in different proportions;
Couple takes unquestionably the foremost place, from her unmatched
proficiency in matrimonial strategetics. I happened to be her part-
ner the other evening, at the Watertons', in a rubber. Playing at
whist is, with her, all a pretence; other people play for amusement,
she shuffles and cuts upon business. The stakes, nominally, were
half-a-crown points, really, her venture was one of our adversaries
himself—a rich young baronet She opens the game at the very
first deal, thus:— |
“It really is kind of you, Sir Charles, to settle down to whist,
while the attractions in the ball-room are so far superior; where—”
“Hearts are trumps, I think,” interrupted Sir Charles's partner.
“No, diamonds. I have heard immense things of your waltzing,
Sir Charles. My young friend, Miss Rose Robinson, is also a lovely
danseuse—(my play —a thousand pardons). By-the-bye, Mr. Buss,
what has become of your friend, Mr. Kennedy ?”
“Five minutes ago I saw him dancing with the lady you mention,"
I replied.
“Well,” responded Mrs. Couple, looking straight at the baronet to
watch the effect of her words, “I must say they are an extremely
handsome couple.”
Sir Charles Simper looked up, bit his lip, and lost three tricks by
a revoke I
The lady's point was gained—her game so far won. Rose Robinson
had excited an interest in Sir Charles ; a foundation did exist for the
superstructure of manoeuvring by which she intended to complete
the match. His emotion on her mentioning the name of another in
the same breath with Rose's was conclusive.
Meanwhile Miss Robinson, who in the last chapter was in doubt
how to act concerning certain billets, was, when our whist party
broke up, waltzing right furiously with their author, Mr. Frank Ken-
nedy. An ordinary chaperon would have swooned at the inauspi-
cious sight; but Mrs. Couple knew better; her experience told her
that for fanning the slow burning flame of a doubtful or recently
kindled passion there is nothing so effectual as a rival. She was
right. Sir Charles claimed Rose's hand for the next dance, and
seemed very unwilling to resign it to a new partner.
Those who compose the second class, become match-makers
entirely from a spirit—said to be peculiarly strong in the fair sex--of
mischief; from feeling that mitigation of suffering, or increase of
happiness which is experienced by getting other people into the same
scrape they find themselves in ; from, in short, longing to see their
femme sole friends married as well as themselves. This desire appears
to take the fastest hold in wives whose matrimonial age amounts to
from one to three years—for example:—
Pelham Plumer, who, as he has so often declared to me, met Miss
Murray by the merest accident in life, will be extremely astonished
if he sees these papers, and learns that the whole accident was an
affaire arrangée, got up under the able management of the damsel’s

married cousin, in manner following:—One evening Mrs. Keppel met
Plumer at a party, was struck with the extreme neatness of his dress,
the precision of his demeanour, and the very comfortable-in-cir-
cumstances aspect of his whole appearance. She at once decided
that he would make an unexceptionable husband for her cousin and
confidante Maria Murray.
In a few days, the spinster, then at Brighton, received a letter from
Mrs. Keppel, to which a postscript was appended to the effect that—
“Talking of men, an exceedingly grave good-looking personage ap-
peared at the S–’s last night, whom I ascertained holds a superior
office in the Treasury (say seven hundred a year). He resides at
Mrs. Scraper's Boarding-house in our Square, and walks in the en-
closure every morning from nine till ten. I shall certainly get him
into our set, if dearest Maria, you will come and spend the next
month with us.”
One of the results of this intimation, our readers know ; another
was, that in the fourth of the morning walks—by which time the eye-
conversation had been carried to its utmost limits—Mrs. Keppel ac-
companied her cousin, and claimed acquaintance with Plumer upon
the strength of having met him once at the S 's. A speaking
connaissance was thus established between Pelham and the young lady
from Brighton, which promised to be a lasting one ; for, true to her
word, Mrs. Keppel asked him to her next soirée.
A third kind of match-making, is that negociated between the
Court and the City—between rank and riches—between the coronet
and the counter. Electioneering, or some other expensive amusement,
has driven the Earl of Lumberton frequently to Lombard-street.
Amongst other City news, he hears of a rich heiress or a passée widow
with “a plum.” An introduction is speedily procured for his eldest
son, Lord Tom, a dashing fellow, who receives orders to make love to
the fortune. All is soon arranged, and in a month or two, the whole
catastrophe appears in the Morning Post, under the head of “A
Marriage in High Life.” When city fortunes are very immense
indeed, they become celebrated, and are spoken of in the same
terms one mentions the Arcot Diamond or the Duke of Northumber-
land. Royalty itself has interfered in such cases. A Duke and a
banker's widow have, before now, been united by sovereign agency;
so that match-making is not so ignoble an employment after all !
A purely city match comes next. The fathers are the match-
makers, and the courtship is carried on by means of bankers'
cheques and ledgers. George Bacon must “have” Mary Hammon,
because both their parents are provision-dealers, so that the busi-
ness connexions may be joined as well as the young people;—that is
to say, if the money accounts can be satisfactorily adjusted. “These
kind of people,” says the Baron Moratin, “take a pen, and make out
on a sheet of paper, a statement of the property. Four and two
make six; eight and seven make fifteen; add so much, deduct so
much, and there remains so much. They cast up the account at the
foot of the page, and, according to its total amount, so there is, or is
not—a marriage.”
This is also the case with many “county” matches; but, instead
of employing accountants in this instance, land-surveyors are called
on ; and, upon their report, the “happy event” is made to depend.

Oh say, could I walk down Regent-street?
Come away, come away; nay, do not pause,
Oh with thee I’m ready at once to fly;
Como away, come away—don't ask the cause,
But come, nor seek the reason why.
You still delay, and fain would know
Why I wish to fly. Oh, my brain! it reels 1

THE DEBATE ON THE DRAMA.
Lond MAHox has ventured to call the attention of Parliament to
the present state of the English stage; and Parliament has, of course,
addressed its deliberative wisdom to the subject, with all that earnest-
ness that has ever characterised the conduct of the Senate, when
playhouses, plays, and players are “the swelling theme.”
A noble lord descants on the great social importance of the theatre:
the names of Shakspeare and “the elder dramatists” are invoked—
half-a-dozen members drone “hear, hear”—the Utilitarians holding a
scornful silence—the Home Secretary confesses himself perfectly
ignorant of the subject, at the same time confessing to his ignorance,
as if it were an especial grace—then rises a member to move the
second reading of a Turnpike Bill; and for the next half-dozen years
the House of Commons is relieved from all notice of motion on that
most insignificant of social interests, the English drama.
We confess our apprehensions, that such will be the result of Lord
Mahon's petition. We have little faith in the zeal or interest of
Government for the theatre. It is too mean, too contemptible in its
operation on society to engage the minds of men devoted to the loftiest
purposes of politics. What is Hamlet to a half-farthing
At present, law permits every sort of rascality to go hand in hand
with the stage. Would a man gull his rich friend, let him propose
to him the partnership of a minor theatre. Well, the man of money
calls for the accounts of a most prosperous season; whereupon his
partner pleads himself “a rogue and vagabond ;” the law, in its
gravity, allows the plea, and the man of wealth is cheated according
to Act of Parliament. He has engaged in an unlawful transaction,
namely, the playing of a play in a house with no patent for such a pri-
vilege, and his partner—the “active” man who has worked upon the
premises—pockets the whole of the profits.
Let us suppose another case. An actor makes an engagement at—-
let us assume — the Victoria playhouse. Well, the managerial
genius of the Surrey thinks the comedian hired by his rival would be
especially advantageous to himself. A brief yet most significant treaty
ensues, and the Victoria actor, contemptuous of all previous engage-
ment, takes his rouge and hare's foot to the Surrey. The worthy Mr.
Osh ALDIston is deprived of a most valuable actor, and Miss V INCENT,
the “only acknowledged heroine of domestic drama,” (all others being
spurious,) loses, it may be, a most effective lover in the last new
piece—The Magnanimous Manglewoman. What remedy has either Mr.
O. or Miss V. None, positively none. Mr. OsbALD1ston has merely
to sigh over the iniquity of the law that permits a man to be a
scoundrel, and puts money in his pocket as a reward of his baseness.
We take case the third. An author writes a piece; it fills the
house—redeems the manager from bankruptcy. The author—with
that humility, that gentleness of bearing that becomes the misery,
the penury of his calling—presents his pauper hand for payment of
the manager. Whereupon Mr. DAGG Enwood may draw himself up,
and, looking down upon the wretch, say—“Yes, your piece was very
good; it drew well—devilish well; but then, you know, it was an
unlawful act to play it, and I have too much reverence for the sta-
tutes of my country to break them and pay for them at the same
time.”
Case the fourth. The player attends at the treasury on Saturday.
“I shall not give you a shilling of the five-and-twenty I covenanted
to give you ; not one shilling. Get your remedy where you can ; for
you have acted with only a magistrate's license—you have played in
Jonathan Bradford, when you are permitted by law only to dance or
sing—and here, Mr. Mug Gi Ns, you get no penny.” Thus speaks the
manager; and thus may law pat him on the back, and justify him in
his evil-doing.
The prayer of the petition presented by Lord MAHON is simply
that Parliament will, in the bounty of its wisdom, permit what are
now called the minor theatres to play the very best dramas they cant
obtain : as at present constituted they are only open to the very
worst. A new genius rises : he writes another Macbeth. Well, Mr.
WEBst ER, of the Haymarket, may not think much of Macbeth ; or
the principal actor may wish to have Lady Macbeth cut out, to
strengthen his own part. This the author refuses to do; and there-
upon takes Macbeth to Covent-garden. Unfortunately, there is no
tragic actress on the premises. Well, the dramatist crosses to Drury-
lane. The arrangements are made for the season ; and—there is no
room for Macbeth until the next year; or, what may be worse, there
may be certain curtailments required, on the one hand, and obsti-
nately withstood, on the other. Well, there is a young Mr. GARRick
just come out at the Pavilion who would play Macbeth most splen-
didly: but, alas ! the Pavilion is not licensed for tragedy; what is

played there is played in defiance of the law, and the author of
Macbeth, if he would bring his play upon the stage, must do so in
contempt of the statutes.
Again, virtue, decency, loyalty, and a bundle of other excellences,
are only valuable in Westminster. In that city of light and goodness,
the Lond CHAMBERLAIN deputes some holy man to read all plays ere
they are permitted to be produced before a Westminster audience.
There is no such care taken or the souls of Southwark and Islington.
The Victoria audiences may be the Alsatians of play-goers, and laugh,
and weep, and hoot, in defiance of law. They get their Jack Sheppards,
unlicensed and unpaid for; but the strait-laced frequenters of the
Adelphi and Olympic have the satisfaction of knowing that their Jack
Sheppard has been licensed by a Deputy, for a certain amount of Her
Majesty's money. There, the beauties of Tyburn are exhibited with
* cum privilegio.
Will Lord Mahon's petition have the effect of altering this wicked-
ness, this stupidity, this injustice, and absurdity?—We hope it may ;
but, we repeat it, we have little faith in the enthusiasm of Parlia-
ment. With the worthy gentlemen who compose it, the playhouse is
become low and vulgar. Were they called upon to debate what
should be the statute length of CERIto's petticoats, we should have
greater hope of their activity, than when the subject involves the
true interests of the English dramatist, and the real value of the
English stage.
We have only opened this subject, and shall, in a short time, return
to it. Q.
THE PASSAGE OF PRIMROSE-HILL.
THE following pathetic passage appears in a report of a meeting on the
painful subject of the closing of the thoroughfare over Primrose-hill —
“Mr. Sasse called upon the parishioners of Marylebone to act with
determination, and appoint a day when they should meet in large numbers
to force down the obstruction on the Marylebone side of Primrose-hill.
This precipitate proceeding was repudiated, and ultimately a committee
was appointed to go to Primrose-hill, accompanied by several old rate-
payers, who could testify to the existence of the path at least fifty years,
and to wait upon the vestry, and request their co-operation therein.”
To the names of Hannibal, who cut a passage through the Alps—of
Napoleon, who did the same thing—of Ross, who went asſaras he could, and
who was only stopped by nature having stuck up a notice of “No Thorougli-
fare,” in letters of ice, on the top of the North Pole—to the names of all
these history has already added that of Sasse, who, at the head of a small
but gallant band of determined trespassers, two years ago, cut a passage
through the Hippodrome.

A BOARDING PARTY.
Bayswater will long reinember the day when the opposing hurdle was
levelled with the dust, and the name of Sasse will be long held sacred in
the milky annals of Kensington.
A new suburban movement seems to be on the eve of breaking out on
the Regent's Park frontier, and the recent stoppage of the thoroughfare
over Primrose Hill is probably destined, at no distant date (say next
week) to render the surrounding valleys a scene of broil and "battle.
Already has a determined knot of rate-payers assembled at the Queen's
Head, and the bright example of Sasse, . led an army of charity-boys
triumphantly over the race course of the Hippodrome, is already pointed
out as a fit exploit for the Primrosians to imitate.
Fortunately for the cause of peace and good order, a veteran rate-payer,
foreseeing the horrors that an invasion might produce, and dreading the
renewal of Norman restlessness, proposed that the passage of Primrose
Hill should not at once be forced, but that moral power shall be tried ere
physical is finally resorted to. It is agreed that a little body of veteran
rate-payers shall present themselves on the spot, and appealing to the
recollection of a fifty years' right of way, shall endeavour to melt the
hurdles by a look; and we can well º the look that will be
given. We fancy we can see those old and sentimental rate-payers
engaged in that solemn and affecting duty, of rolling back the door of
recollection upon the hinges of time, and endeavouring to overcome the
Present by bringing up the past in judgment against the threatened
future. If Wilkie had been living, we would not that he should have
been absent, from the scene, when those old men shall look upon
. #" of way in reproach of him who now attempts to bar them
out of it.
THE HERM IT OF BATTER SEA,
OR
THE RECLUSE OF THE RED-HOUSE.
It was a lovely afternoon last week when a tall young man in a
Pembroke wrapper—warranted to weigh four ounces and a half—
emerged from the romantic little opening which runs along the mar-
gin of the Thames by the side of the Bishop's Garden at Lambeth.
Having succeeded in arresting the reader's attention by one of
those literary capiases which, in the shape of a little sentiment, are
sure to take, we will drop metaphor at once, and, throwing off the
macintosh of mystery, we will at once stand divulged in the ordinary
surtout of every-day life, and admit that it is ourselves, whom, under
the guise of a tall young man in a Pembroke wrapper, we are pro-
ceeding to talk about.
Well, then, we had heard much of a melancholy being at the Red-
House—“a gentle hermit,” not of the dale, for dale there is none in
those parts, but of the swamp—yes, the swamp, that 's the word—at
Battersea. We resolved to visit him; and having gained the oscil-
lating barge at Lambeth, we took our opportunity to leap from it on
to the deck of the Bachelor, and in a few minutes we were scudding
away, with a wet sail—for the sail had fallen overboard, and was
literally soaked—towards Battersea.
Every one knows the lovely little panorama which spreads itself
upon the banks of the Thames between Vauxhall and Chelsea. Here
a chimney seems to mock the clouds with the dingy smoke which it
continually belches forth, while here and there a coal-wharf spreads
its bargey riches far into the lap of father Thames, who seems
rocking to sleep his swarthy children by the slightly undulating
motion he ever and anon indulges in. The picture is one of light
and loveliness, and—but for the horrible smell from the soap-boilers'
on the shore—we might think the people Peris, and the place a Para-
dise. We were indulging in these dreams of brighter and better
things, when a shrill shout of “Anybody not paid their passage,”
brought us to a sense of the fact that if the people around us
Down with the stumpy.
had sprung from British soil, they had not all risen to the elevation
of British grammar.
It was fortunate for the attainment of the object of our trip, that
a notice on the paddle-box of the steamer arrested—or, to speak
more poetically, put into quod our attention ; for had the aris
escaped our observation, the hermit of the Red-House would have
been, like Yarrow—unvisited. The notification was to this effect:-It
began with a refreshing allusion to ginger beer, and went off some-
what insidiously into an announcement of cigars and spirits, all of
which it was alleged were to be had by application to “the steward,”—
a gentleman who divides his attention between the wants of the
passengers, the inclinations of the chimney in passing under bridges,
and the necessities of running about with a porter's knot, attached
to a rope, with which he breaks collisions and windows in about an
equal proportion. The affair is called a fender, and is no less
destructive than a set of fire-irons against the glazed port-holes of
rival steamers.
But to my tale —At the end of the notice on the subject of re-
freshments was a mysterious paragraph, stating that if any one
wished to land at the Red-House, he must notify the same to the
captain; an announcement which seemed to wrap the character of
the hermit in still greater mystery, for the venerable man was evi-
dently not one to be popped in upon, like vulgar mortals, without a
preliminary warning.
Having notified my intention to the captain—a weather-beaten
and smoke-dried tar of the Thames—I was placed on shore, and in
a few minutes I felt that I was about to be alone with the hermit. I
sat down for a few moments on the rude seat, and precious rude it
was, for it tipped backwards on the end of the pier, and my emo-
tions becoming too much for me, I burst into a flood of tears, which
always afford relief to the swelling bosom ; and I am not ashamed
to say, that mine did swell at the time with a terrific tumour of
sentiment.

I at length summoned courage to proceed, and walked with a tot-
tering step—tottering only with the deepest emotion—towards the
upper end of the pier, and my eyes quickly lighted on a wooden
erection which I could not doubt was the modest asylum of the
hermit. The sound of my footsteps on the deal boards of the pier
disturbed the good man—probably at his devotions—and a bald
head which might, for what I know, have been white with age,
though it was concealed in a seal-skin north-wester—was suddenly
thrust forward.

the Hermit of Battersea My feelings were so poignant, that I took
out my pocket-handkerchief, and blew my nose powerfully. The
good man seemed to pay little regard to my strong and agonising
emotions, but stretching forth his hand—hardened, no doubt, by
mortification, and reddened by devotional clasps—addressed me in
a curt and peremptory tone, which, to say the truth—putting all
sentiment aside—considerably disgusted me. “Checks here, Sir,”
were the brief and unceremonious words of the Recluse, as he
clutched from my hand the ticket which I had insensibly carried in
it all the way from Lambeth.

MISS TICKLETOBY'S LECTURES ON
ENGLISH HISTORY.
N the lecture-room we observed
one of the noblest of our poet-
philosophers who was assiduously
taking notes, and we say that it is
to ADolphus SIM coe, Esq.re.,
author of the Ghoul, Leila, Idio-
syncracy, &c., that we are in-
debted for the following Philo-
sophical Synopsis of Miss Tickle-
# toby's First Lecture on English
| History, delivered to her pupils
and their friends on the – July,
at her Scholastic Hall, Little
Britain. 1. On the painful im-
pression occasioned by the con-
templation of early barbarism.—
- – 2. The disposition of the human
mind to avow such a study.—3. The mystic and the historic : their
comparative beauty and excellence—the Lecturer promises on a
further occasion to speak upon the former subject.
4. Spite of his unwillingness, ’tis the duty of the student to
acquaint himself with all the facts of history, whether agreeable or
not, and of the tutor to urge by erery means the unwilling.
5. Various hypotheses with regard to the first colonisation of
Britain. The hypothesis of the chivalric ages, and of the cycle of
Arthur.—6. The insufficiency of all theories upon the subject proved
by a familiar appeal to the student's own powers of memory.
7. THE ANCIENT BR1Tons—their costume, (8) its singular resem-
blances with that of the transatlantic savage, (9) a passing word of
reprobation upon an odious modern custom.
10. THE RELIGIon of THE BRITons.—11. A religion inseparable
from a priesthood—The attributes of the Druidical priesthood, their
privileges and powers.-12. Of the rewards that the state ought to
grant to the ministers of its government, its laws and its education.
13. THE WARs of THE BRIto.Ns.—14. Their weapons.—15.
Their various fortunes in the field.
16. The influence of the Priests upon their campaigns.—17. The
barbaric sacrifices in the groves of Odin.-17. Fanciful simile.
18. The Priestesses: grammatical distinction to be drawn between
them and the Priests.
19. Episode of Miss Higgins and Master Smith, absurd blunder of
the latter.
20. The Romans IN BRITAIN.—21. The character of Caesar.—
22. Of his successors.-23. Their victories over the barbarous
Britons a blessing and not an evil.—24. The Scottish boasts of in-
vincibility; the true view of them.
25. THE Down FALL of THE Roman EMPIRE. The legions with-
drawn from Britain. Depredations of the Scots in that unhappy island.
The following questions on the most important points of the Lec-
ture were delivered by Miss Tickletoby to her pupils:–

SCENE AS BEFORE.
THE Picts, The Scots, THE DANEs ; GREgory THE SAT1R1st,
THE conversion of THE BRIToNs, THE charact ER of ALFRED.—
I did not in my former lecture make the least allusion to the speech
of Queen Boadicea to her troops before going into action, because,
although several reports of that oration have been handed down to
us, not one of them as I take it is correct, and what is the use, my
darlings, of reporting words (hers were very abusive against the
Romans)—of reporting words that never were uttered There's
scandal enough, loves, in this wicked world without going back to old
stories: real scandal too, which may satisfy any person. Nor did I
mention King Caractacus's noble behaviour before the Roman Em-
peror Claudius—for that history is so abominably stale that I am
sure none of my blessed loves require to be told it.
When the Britons had been deserted by the Romans, and found
themselves robbed and pillaged by the Picts and Scots, they sent
over to a people called Saxons (so called because they didn't live in
Saxony); who came over to help their friends, and having turned
out the Picts and Scots, and finding the country a pleasant one to
dwell ; , they took possession of it, saying that the Britons did not
deserve to have a country, as they did not know how to keep it.
This sort of argument was considered very just in those days—and
I’ve seen some little boys in this school acting Saxon-fashion : for in-
stance, Master Spry the other day took away a piece of gingerbread
from Master Jones, giving him a great thump on the nose instead ;
and what was the consequence? I showed Master Spry the injustice
of his action, and punished him severely.
(To Master Spry). How did I punish you, my dear !—tell the
company.
Master Spry). You kept the gingerbread. -
§: T., severely). I don't mean that : how else did I punish you ?
(Master Spry). You vipped me: but I kicked your shins all the
time
Unruly boy —but so it is, ladies and gentlemen, in the infancy of
individuals as in that of nations: we hear of these continual scenes
of violence, until prudence teaches respect for property, and law be-
comes stronger than force. To return to the Saxons, they seized
upon the goods and persons of the effeminate Britons, made the latter
their slaves, and sold them as such in foreign countries. The mind
shudders at such horrors How should you like, you naughty Master
Spry, to be seized and carried from your blessed mother's roof–(im-
mense sensation, and audible sobbing among the ladies present)—how
* you like to be carried off and sold as a slave to France or
Italy
(Master Spry).
there ain’t.
(Miss T.) Yes, sir, there are schools, and Rods.
[Immense uproar. Cries of “shame no flogging ! serve him right !
no tyranny horse him this instant " With admirable presence
of mind, however, Miss Tickletoby stopped the disturbance by
unfolding her GREAT Historical Pictun E —of which we give
the outline below.]
It chanced that two lovely British children, sold like thousands of
others by their ruthless Saxon masters, were sent to Rome, and ex-
posed upon the slave-market there. Fancy those darlings in such
a situation 1
There they stood — weeping and wretched, thinking of their
parents' cot, in the far Northern Isle, sighing and yearning, no doubt,
for the green fields of Albin" :
It happened that a gentleman by the name of Gregory, who after-
wards rose to be Pope of Rome—but who was then a simple clerical
gent, passed through the market, with his friends, and came to the
spot where these poor British children stood.
The Reverend Mr. Gregory was instantly struck by their appear-
ance—by their rosy cheeks, their golden hair;
their little jackets covered all over with sugar-
loaf buttons, their poor nankeens grown all too
short by constant wash and wear: and de-
manded of their owner, of what nation the little
darlings were :
The man (who spoke in Latin) replied that
they were Angli, that is, Angles or English.
“Angles,” said the enthusiastic Mr. Gregory,
“they are not Angles, but Angels;” and with
this joke, which did not do much honour to his
head, though certainly his heart was good, he
approached the little dears, caressed them, and
made still further inquiries regarding themt.
Miss Pontifer (one of the little girls). And did
Mr. Gregory take the little children out of
slavery, and send them home, ma'am!
“Mr. Hume, my dear good little girl, does
not mention this fact; but let us hope he did :
with all my heart, I’m sure I hope he did.
But this is certain, that he never forgot
them, and when in process of time he came to
be Pope of Rome—”
Master Marimus Pontifer. Pasays my name's
Lat’n for Pope of Rome; is it, ma'am
“I’ve no doubt it is, my love, since your
papa says so : and when Gregory became Pope
of Rome, he despatched a number of his clergy
to England, who came and converted the
benighted Saxons and Britons, and they gave up their hideous idols,
and horrid human sacrifices, and sent the wicked Druids about their
business.
The Saxons had ended by becoming complete masters of the coun-
try, and the people were now called Anglo or English-Saxons. There
were a great number of small sovereigns in the land then : but about
the year 830, the King called Egbert became the master of the whole
country; and he, my loves, was the father of Alfred:
Alfred came to the throne after his three brothers, and you all
know how good and famous a king he was. It is said that his father
indulged him, and that he did not know how to read until he was
twelve years old—but this, my dears, I cannot believe.; º; at least,
I cannot but regret that there were no nice day-schools then, where
children might be taught to read before they were twelve, or ten, or
even eight years old, as many of my dear scholars can:
[Miss Tickletoby here paused for a moment, and resumed her
lecture with rather a tremulous voice.]
It is my wish to amuse this company as well as I can, and some-
times, therefore, for I am by nature a facetious old woman, heartily
Is there any schools there I shouldn't mind if
* Albin, the ancient name of England: not to be confounded with Albin, hair-
dresser and wig-maker to the bar, Essex Court, Temple.
+ Miss Tickletoby did not, very properly, introduce the other puns which Gregory
made on the occasion, they are so atrociously bad that they could not be introduced
into the columns of Punch.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
loving a bit of fun, I can't help making jokes about subjects which
other historians treat in a solemn and pompous way.
But, dears, I don't think it right to make one single joke about
good King Alfred; who was so good, and so wise, and so gentle, and
so brave, that one can't laugh, but only love and honour his memory.
Think of this, how rare good kings are, and let us value a good one
when he comes. We have had just fifty kings since his time, who
have reigned for near a thousand long years, and he the only Great one.
Brave and victorious many of them have been, grand and sumptuous,
and a hundred times more powerful than he but who cares for one
of them (except Harry V. and I think Shakspeare made that king)—
who loves any of them except him—the man who spoiled the cakes in
the herdsman's cottage, the man who sung and played in the Danes'
camp : -
There are none of you so young but know those stories about him.
Look how, when the people love a man, how grateful they are For
a thousand years these little tales have passed from father to son all
through England, and every single man out of millions and millions
who has heard them has loved King Alfred in his heart, and
blessed him, and was proud that he was an Englishman's king. And
then he hears that Alfred fought the Danes, and drove them out of
England, and that he was merciful to his enemies, and kept faith at
a time when every one else was deceitful and cruel, and that he was
the first to make laws, and establish peace and liberty among us.
Who cares for Charles the Second, secured in his oak, more than
for any other man at a pinch of danger? Charles might have staid
in his tree for us, or for any good that he did when he came down.
But for King Alfred, waiting in his little secret island until he
should be strong enough to have one more battle with his conquerors,
or in the camp of the enemy singing his songs to his harp, who does
not feel as for a dear friend or father in danger, and cry hurra! with
all his heart, when he wins !
All the little Children. Hurray Alfred for ever !
Yes, my dears, you love him all, and would all fight for him,
I know.
Master Spry. That I would. -
I'm sure you would, John, and may you never fight for a worse
cause ! Ah, it’s a fine thing to think of the people loving a man
for a thousand years . We shan't come to such another in the
course of all these lectures—except mayhap if we get so far, to one
George—
Mr. Mortimer (aloud, and with much confidence.) George the
Fourth, you mean, Miss, the first gentleman in Europe.
Miss T. (sternly.) No, Sir ; I mean GEoRGE WASHINGto.N,-the
American Alfred, Sir, who gave and took from us many a good beating,
and drove the English-Danes out of his country.
Mr. Mortimer. Disgusting raddicle !—De Lancey, my dear, come
with me. Mem —I shall withdraw my son from your academy.
[Ereunt MoRTIMER, S' & Jr.
Miss T. Let them go. As long as honest people agree with me,
what care I what great men's flunkies choose to think? Miss Budge,
make out Mr. Mortimer's account. Ladies and Gentlemen, on
Wednesday next I hope for the honour of resuming these lectures.
Punch, in concluding this long paper, begs to hint to Mr. Simcoe,
whose remuneration will be found at the office, that for the future
he may spare his own remarks, philosophical, laudatory, or otherwise,
and confine himself simply to the Lectures of Miss Tickletoby.
A CABMAN'S CANZONET.
Oh, do not upbraid me ! the boon that I crave
Is not more than Adolphus, ma'am, yields:
Believe me, a shilling's a very close shave
From Pall-Mall to Lincoln’s-inn Fields.
I obey'd the behest which you gave when I closed
My cabriolet door, as you know ;
“For,” said you, “as I feel myself much indispeed,
O drive, Mr. Coachman—drive slow !”
Still obdurate, lady ?—What's fourpence to you
But a drop in your ocean of tin *
To me it is life—it's a quartern of “dew; "
But you, oh you cannot take gin
You spurn me again! O shame on your sex
l'hl return when your passions are calm ;
I shan't give no change, and if still you objects,
Take my number, and summons me, ma'am.
COURT CIRCULAR.
Mas. Nona O'Murphy took a turn round Clare-market yesterday
morning with a wheelbarrow, . ornamented with Prussian blues and
juvenile Yorkshire reds. She e several calls, and paid visits to most
of the palaces in the neighbourhood.
Mr. Jacob Roughandtough and his lady honoured the free-and-easy at
the Blue Moon with their presence, and after the performance were
escorted to the station-house by a numerous body of the A division.
Mr. R., at the suggestion of Mr. Jardine, has gone on a visit to the
governor of Brixton tread-wheel.
THE CHANDOS TESTIMONIAL.
“A very splendid piece of presentation plate,” says the Times, “pre-
sented by the farmers of Buckinghamshire to his Grace the Duke of
Buckingham, in testimony of their high respect for him, and for the
interest he has taken in the agricultural prosperity of the country, has just
been manufactured. * * * It is in height about five feet, and the lower
portion or ground-work is supported by lions, and from it rises a pillar or
column, surmounted with a wheatsheaf, which can be removed, and a
branch of tapers affired.”
Surely this must be a sly hint to his Grace, for no one has done more to
remove the wheatsheaf, and induce its consequences, than the Duke of
Buckingham.
GREEN-ROOM LIBERALITY.
The liberality of Mr. Charles Kean is on all hands allowed. We are
happy to find that this high feeling has, within these few days, been most
touchingly acknowledged by a brother actor. . It is well known that Mr.
Charles Kean, in the handsomest manner, insisted upon the engagement
of Mr. Phelps to act the part (which he plays so very finely) in “The
Rose of Arragon.” The comparative effect of the acting of the two gen-
tlemen is now well known. Mr. Phelps, with a high sentiment of gratitude,
for the generosity of the tragedian, did, on Monday last, in full Haymarket
green-room, present to Mr. Charles Kean a very handsome silver–
|ertinguisher 1
“PUNCH" begs to announce, that, on
Saturday next,

performances. Whe
n he states that it is

LETTER II.-words AND THEIR COUNTERFETS
—How To RECEIVE AND PASS OFF THE SAME,
WITH other USEFUL COUNSEL.
MY DEAR Boy, I am much pleased with
your last letter. Your remarks on the copies
set you by your excellent master, Dr. Birch-
bud, convince me that schooling has not been
lost upon you. However, beware lest you look too closely into the sig-
nificance and meaning of words. This is an unprofitable custom, and
has spoilt the fortunes of many a man. You may have observed a team
of horses yoked to a heavy wagon; may have heard the bells hanging
about their head-gear tinkle, tinkle, tinkle. The bells are of no use–
none, save to keep up a monotonous jingle; although, doubtless, Giles
the waggoner will assure you that the music cheers the horses on the
dusty road, and, under the burning sun, makes them pull blithely and
all together. Now, there is a certain lot of sentences in use among
men precisely like these bells. They mean nothing—are not intended
to mean anything—but, still, custom requires the jingle. Thus, when
you meet a man whom you have seen, perhaps, thrice before—and he
declares that “he is delighted to see you,” albeit it would give him no
concern whatever if you were decorating the next gibbet—you must
not, for a moment, look a doubt of his joy, but take his rapture as a
thing of course. If he squeeze your hand until your knuckles crack
—squeeze again. If he declare that “you’re looking the picture of
health,” asseverate upon your honour that “he has the advantage of
you, for you never saw him look better.” He may at the time be in
the last stage of a consumption—you may have a hectic fever in your
cheek; no matter for that ; you have both of you jingled your bells,
and with lightened consciences may take your separate way.
I could, my dear child, enlarge upon this subject. It is enough,
that I caution you, in your intercourse with the world, not to take
words as so much genuine coin of standard metal, but merely as
counters that people play with. If you estimate them as anything
above this, you will be in the hapless condition of the wretch who
takes so many gilt pocket-pieces for real Mint guineas; contempt
and beggary will be your portion. Thinking yourself rich beyond
the wealth of Abraham Newland in the golden promises of men, you
will risk a kicking from the threshold of the first verbal friend
whom you seek for small change.
Your last copy, you tell me, was—
“Command you may, your mind from play.”
You object to this as an unreasonable dogma. You say, you cannot
command your mind from play; and insinuate it to be an imperti-
nence on the part of your master to assume any such likelihood on
your part. In fact, you deny it in toto. More than this ; you had the
hardihood to contest the propriety of the text with your worthy mas-
ter, who, you further inform me, appealed to your moral sense through
your fleshly tabernacle, and—for some minutes—left you not a leg
to stand upon.
I cannot, my dear boy, regret this last incident. It will, I hope,
impress upon your mind the necessity of taking certain sentences
current in the world for precisely what they are worth, without hal-
looing and calling a crowd about you to show their cracked and coun-
terfeit condition. Doctor Birchbud, when a boy, had written
“Command you may, your mind from play"
b
a hundred and a hundred times in fine large text-hand. Well, did
he believe in the saw any more for that Did he, think you, expect
you to believe in it? “Then wherefore—you may ask in your ignor-
ance—did he scourge me, if not for believing " Foolish boy it was
for not seeming to beliere. This is precisely the treatment you will
meet with in the world, if, with courageous conceit, you attempt to
test the alloy mixed up in so much of its verbal coinage—coinage
that is worn thin with handling; which wise men know the true
value of, and pocket for what it’s worth, and which only fools
(and the worst of fools they call martyrs) ring, and rub, and look
at, and having done so, screech out—“bad money !”
Now, my dear boy, the next time the worthy Doctor Birchbud gives
you the copy—
“Command you may, your mind from play,”
look at it with sudden reverence, square your elbows with de-
termined energy, take up your pen as though you were about to
book the text “in the red-leaved tablet of your heart,”—and having, in
solemn silence, made the required number of copies, take the book
up to your master, and, as you give it in, let your countenance
appear at once informed and dignified with the beautiful truth you
have consigned to paper, nay, let your whole anatomy seem at that
moment absorbing the grand lesson you have inscribed in your copy-
book. This done, you may return to your seat, and—whenever the
master's head is turned aside—you may go on with your game of
“odd or even” under the desk with Jack Rogers, play at “soldiers”
on your slate, or any other pastime that may take your fancy. It
is sufficient that you have gravely registered your belief, that—
“Command you may, your mind from play.”
The registration is enough ; whether you can, or will, is altogether
another matter.
This subject reminds me of an inquiry you once made, at a time
when you were too young to comprehend the matter. On the paper
envelope of a square of Windsor soap, was printed the Royal Arms.
I recollect your charming smile at the lion and unicorn; and the
childish curiosity which prompted you to inquire the meaning of the
royal legend—
** Dieu et mon droit.”
That, my child, means, “God and my right.” When you shall
have mastered something more of the History of England, and shall
have read all that certain kings have done under that motto, you will
then more fully understand what I have written to you upon taking
words as counters, not as real things; of the necessity of always
seeming to believe them the true coin, and the danger of crying
Counterfeit “God and my right !” Ha, my dear boy, there have been

sports. In due season, with the grace of fortune, you will be able to
hunt hares, those pestilent and dangerous creatures having been
especially provided to exercise the muscles and the intellects of man.
Should you obtain that position in the world, which it is my fervent
prayer you will arrive at, you may also be permitted to join in a royal
hunt, a pastime of the highest dignity, utility, and humanity. For
instance, you will chase a stag, for the express and only purpose of
terrifying it; and having put it to an hour or two of serviceable agony,
you will have it caught and conducted back to the pasture, to be left
for future enjoyment. As, however, these must be the sports of your
manhood, you are quite right now to begin with linnets and sparrows.
You, my dear son, will one day have to quit the paternal roof for the
great world. By reflecting on what the parent linnets and sparrows
suffer, deprived of their young, you will have some wholesome idea
of the anxiety of your loving parents under a similar affliction.
You ask me to send you some corking-pins that you may spin cock-
chafers upon them. Your mother sends them, with her blessing and
her best love. I trust, however, you will turn this amusement to
your profit. As, under the blessing of heaven, Imay probably article
you to Mr. Abednego, the attorney and money-lender of Jewish per-
suasion, I would counsel you to take particular notice of the conduct
of the cock-chafer, when buzzing and spinning with the pin through
its bowels—to know exactly how long it will live, and how much pin
it will bear. This knowledge—for wisdom comes to us from so many
channels—will be of great use to vou as an attorney, when making
out your hills of costs.
THE WEATHER AND THE CROPS.
The recent warm weather has been very favourable to the crops, and
has raised hopes in the owners of large flat tracts of bald heads, which had
for some time been entirely unproductive. Several parties have brought
a very fair show of produce into the market; but it has been princi-
pally in the beard, for the moustachio erops have failed in almost every
instance.
A very small #. endeavoured to force a premature crop by secur-
ing a quantity of common whisker-seed, and overlaying the whole with a
'rich manure of dirt and bear's grease, but the result was far from satis-
factory.
The long-eared and short-bearded commodity was very plentiful, and
the growers of very lanky crops made an effort to give them a favourable
turn, by keeping several irons in the fire ; but they did not succeed in
bringing matters permanently round as they seem to have expected.

to have no sympathy. There are always horses to be held in Regent-

draw the foreign gentleman away from his beloved trottoir, or prevent

CHAISE.

“I was born,” said the wheel, who,
- of course, was spokesman, “in Long-
acre, and christened after one of the
heathen gods, known to ostlers and
grooms as “Fee—aton. Having got
my body painted green, and my inside
well,lined with yellow, I was packed
up in Russia matting, and sent off by
the carrier to Ealing-common, where
my first master resided.
“The man to whose charge I was
handed over was a smart-looking fel-
low, in a quiet livery, consisting of a
dark surtout, white buckskins, and
top-boots. He looked like a gentle-
man, and acted as such ; for he hired
a man to clean me, and groomed the
horse by deputy.
“My first journey was to Hounslow Barracks, whither my master
—a retired Colonel—went to see an old friend. My occupants were
his daughter, and George the servant; and when my master alighted,
the conversation between the remaining couple was as follows:–
“‘ George, love.’
“‘Yes, my hangel.”
&c & I wish you would brush your hair up on the left side a little
more.
“‘My heverlasting, on course I will; but as I walets myself — ”
“‘For the present, George.”
“For the present I hopes my love will excuse me, if I’m not quite
--quite--
“‘Comme il faut, George.”
--
“‘I don't mean that, love—not quite the cheese.’ And then
George took a mane-comb from his pocket, and arranged his sidelock
to the satisfaction of his young and adoring mistress.
“You can guess the next great event of my existence. One moon-
light night I found myself in a green lane, the bearer of a hair-trunk,
three bundles, and a bonnet-box. In my driving-box was a piece of
bread and cheese, with a large onion, and a quartern of Geneva in a
ginger-beer bottle. George handed in my young mistress, and then
jumped in himself. Off we went lumping and bumping till my springs
ached again; and I have no doubt a very interesting elopement would
have been the consequence, if a moral linchpin, attached to the fore
off-wheel, had not thought proper on a point of principle to withdraw
itself, and a capsize was the consequence. My young missus fainted
of course; but after George had rubbed her nose with the onion,
and compelled her to taste of the Geneva, she recovered just in time
to see her father kick her adored into a ditch, and discover that she
was sitting on her best bonnet.
“George was sent to the hospital, and on the following day I was
consigned to the Pantechnicon. In the course of the ensuing week
I was bought by an ambitious tailor, whose wife had talked him
into a teella, and made him ashamed of carrying a bundle. Here was
a change for a delicate-bodied phaeton The tailor had a large
progeny, and a fat sister, with something in the 3} reduceds; so, for
the first month, I was never empty, except at night. My interior
was degraded into a chandler's shop ; for I was the conveyance for
everything required at the reella down to the bath-brick and hearth-
stone.
Fortune, I thought, had stood my friend when she directed my
master to drive me between a coal-waggon and stage-coach ; for,
though I fractured my axletree, my master broke the bridge of his
nose, and sent me the next day to the “Repository, to “bring what
I could fetch.”
“I was knocked down for a trifle to a bow-legged man, in
top-boots and a belcher handkerchief, who bought me, as he said,
for the “hold hiron,” and I gave myself up as a lost phaeton. Would

to have been found in connexion. Three years have I been en-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GREAT AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATION.
-
HIS Association held its enormous
meeting a few days ago at Bristol,
and the result was in every respect
exceedingly gratifying.
It is not perhaps generally known
that this is a society of persons,
whose common object is to promote
the interests of the British clod-
hopper, and to place the English
ploughboy on that proud pinnacle
which the elevated nature of his
pursuits peculiarly adapts him for.
A part of the objects of the
Association consists in the invention
of implements of agriculture; the
decision on different soils, and the
- cultivation of cattle. The Secretary
produced a new machine, which was peculiarly adapted for extracting
the butter from butterflies. He had never tried it, but he had a
strong idea that it would answer—(Loud cheers).
A Member wished to know whether buttercups would be equally
salubrious after the butter had been removed. (Hear!) The
Secretary did not feel himself at liberty to make any reply to that
question.
In the course of the Meeting, a great deal of very interesting in-
formation was gone into on the subject of different soils; and a
Member produced a very healthy Turnip-radish, which he had sown
in a Mignonette box, and which he had every reason to believe
would partake of the delicate flavour of the flower. (Loud cries of
“Hear, heart” interspersed with repeated shouts of “Taste, taste " and a low
murmur of “Smell, smell ?”) The Member was much perplexed, and after
the original resolution having been twice put and lost, the order of
the day once dropped, and the Radish itself three times let fall, it
was agreed to refer it to a Committee of Taste, who were to nibble
(through their chairman) and report accordingly.
The Grand Potato Show was the next point in the proceedings of
the day; and this was a very interesting part of the business. Sandy
Sam, the proprietor of the can with the chimneys in the New Cut, was
the fortunate winner; for he produced a splendid specimen of the
Pomum Terræ, or Earth-apple, commonly called Potato, which was
served up in a delicate garnish of salt, with a lump of butter at the
top of it. A Subscriber wished to know if the potato before them
was in its natural state, or whether it had undergone the baking pro-
cess. Several members did not know, six could not tell, and the re-
mainder declared themselves not yet in a position to say anything.
This led to much confusion, in the midst of which a juvenile member
of the Association suddenly made off with the delicious vegetable,
and his report on the subject is hourly expected.
The Cultivation of Cattle Section proceeded to inspect the prize
animals, and a fat bullock was immediately introduced, which it was
resolved that a committee should at once sit upon. The bull in ques-
tion seeing a bottle of wine on the table, at once tossed it off, at the
same time sweeping away the glasses with a playful switch of his
tail, while he stood with his fore-leg on the gouty toe of a member of
the Society. The corpulent beast was declared at once entitled to
the leaden medal, and sold to an opulent butcher, who considerately
turned it into
Joint stock.
Something was said on the subject of feeding, and a curious disqui-
sition was commenced on the possibility of bringing up a flea
entirely by hand; but a member declared that he had felt one at his
foot all the preceding night, and had made several efforts to bring it
up by hand, all of which were utterly futile (Loud cheers). The Se-
cretary related an anecdote of a domestic spider, which knew him,
(the secretary) and would take food off his (the secretary's) hand. A
member observed that this was nothing in comparison to a case ho
could relate from his own experience. There was a whole celony
of fleas that were so exceedingly attached to him that they invari-
ably waited till he (the member) came to bed, when they would play-
fully begin to tickle him (the member), and would not only take their
food off his (the member's) hand, but from any part of his (the
member's) person, which they (the fleas) happened to find at the
moment convenient. (Immense sensation).
Perhaps, however, the grand attraction of the day was the Great
Blue-bottle Show, a prize having been offered for the fattest of these
interesting creatures. . Most of them had been fed on brown sugar,
and one was exhibited embedded in treacle, where he had died, with-
out living to enjoy the dignity which, had he survived, the Associa-
tion would, no doubt, have awarded him.
A curious anecdote was told of a wasp having settled on a member's
nose, and a paper was read on the Civilisation of Wasps, with a view
to inducing them to regulate the use of their stings upon equitable
principles. The proceedings terminated with the annual ploughing
match, of which the following are the particulars:—
Blue set off at a steady pace, followed by Red, at the rate of nearly
one mile an hour. Yellow met with a portion of a root, where his
plough stuck fast; while Green, losing all guidance of the machine,
was upset in a hawthorn hedge. Orange then took up the ploughing
at a smartish pace; but his horse turning restive, bolted round into
another field, and cut a beautifully straight trench down the whole
length of a meadow. The match was now entirely between Blue and
Red, both of whom stopped short in the middle of the field, and agreed
to divide the money.
Thus ended one of the most exciting ploughing matches that was
ever recorded in agricultural annals.
A patent harrow was exhibited, the efficiency of which was tested
by a well-dressed member, who fell upon it.

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON IDLER.
cii APT EIt v.–CONCERNING ExhibiTION
LOUNGERS.
ET us imagine
that the whole of
the Regent-street
idlers belong to the
class of loungers
already pourtray-
ed. There are very
many, blest with
something like
avocations and re-
sources, who are
nevertheless fair
specimens of the
class. These are
generally young
men, residing in
chambers, keeping
their terms, and
all sorts of things
besides, and read-
ing for the bar,
which consists in
drinking a certain
number of bottles
of wine on certain
- days at the Middle
Temple Hall, practising the flute, violin, or cornet-à-piston, as the
case may be, in their rooms, and giving perpetual breakfasts to each
other, more especially if they chance to have been out together the
antecedent evening.

HIJNT
This meal lasts from twelve to three, “plus ou moins,” and consists
of coffee, tea, stout, sherry, chops, eggs, herrings, and broiled ham—the
parties being arrayed in slippers and shooting-jackets or borrowed
dressing-gowns. The tenour of the conversation is as follows:–
“Devilish nice party; but I feel wretchedly seedy after it.”
“Have some beer. What a splendid set of girls the Howards
always do contrive to scrape together.”
“I say, Hal, did you find out who that was you waltzed with after
supper ?”
“Made it all safe, sir. She's going to Kensington Gardens on
Saturday. What do you think she said "
“I don’t know—let's have it.”
“Shove that bottle of stout over here, Fred.”
“What a funny speech for a girl 1"
“No, no-nonsense; she told me her people were going to give a
party on the 6th, and I should have an invitation. They live in
Harley-street; all right—Governor’s a West India merchant.”
“She's got tin, then "
“I expect so ; and what a neck and shoulders —Phew!”
“Have you been to Dow's lately 1"
“No-'pon my soul I'm ashamed. It's so long since I called; I
must though. Did you read Platt's speech "
“Rather —capital —pass the pepper.”
And so on for an indefinite period.
These specimens of the London Idler attach themselves to the
same haunts as the others we have just mentioned, but they have
usually more money, and a larger circle of acquaintance; indeed,
the front of the rim of their hat becomes so limp from the constant
bows they make during an afternoon's stroll, that they are com-
pelled, after a while, to turn it hind-side before for convenience.
To this class the varied exhibitions of the metropolis afford an
endless round of amusement; but perhaps the Polytechnic Institu-
tion is their chief lounge. They go down in the diving-bell, for the
sake of being lionized during the thirty seconds which succeed their
re-appearance from the water. They attend the magnified mud-
worms, and dissolving Netley Abbeys and Royal Exchanges, for the
chance of sitting in the dark next to the handsome woman in the
small enticing pink bonnet, who has gone in before them, and whose
glove they picked up and restored to her on the stairs; they listen,
out of pure distraction, and for the twentieth time, to Professor
Bachoffner's demonstration of the electrotypes and galvanic clocks;
and they gaze at the ribbon-looms, printing-presses, and steam-
engines, as well as at all the models, in rotation, until they become
walking catalogues of the entire exhibition.
It is not impossible but that they may conclude their lounge by
watching the progress of manufacturing a bird of paradise (blue,
with a white tail) in blown glass, which they will purchase to take
home with them to their chambers—a circumstance which never
comes to pass, since the whole concern—bird, shade, tail, and all–
gets crushed to an impalpable powder long before they reach their
destination.
Au reste, these loungers are, for the most part, gentlemanly men.
Their dress, bearing, and appearance, is all in keeping; and in this
they differ widely from that lonely, unknown class, the sole end of
whose existence appears to be the accomplishment of a certain num-
ber of promenades about the West End thoroughfares, unrecognizing
and unrecognized, with the idea that they hold their unheeded sta-
tion in society by this diurnal labour. With these, dress and display
are the ruling passions, and in matters of the toilet is comprised all
their knowledge. They cannot see what need a man has of intellect
or talent, provided his boots and trowsers are fashionably faultless;
and, whilst bestowing all their care on the outside of their head, they
regard the brains as mere accessories to existence. Can it be
credited, that not a fortnight back we met one of these poor do-
nothings in Regent-street, who, not content with the impression his
general contour made upon the world, had actually dyed his mousta-
chios, and—we write in pity and disgust—painted his cheeks / Should
this open page meet his eye, as he listlessly gazes in some shop
window, he will not fail to recognise his likeness. Let us be per-
mitted to recommend him immediately to wash his face at the first
available accommodation, even though, for lack of means to procure
better, it be beneath the pump in Burlington Gardens.
Finally, with respect to the Regent-street Loungers, a great advan-
tage to all of them is the facility with which they accommodate then-
selves to whatever circle chance may pitch them into. They lounge
on from one scene to the other, with a trace of their preceding occu-
pation being visible. An idler has been known on the best authority,
if by chance a ticket for Her Majesty's Theatre has fallen in his way,
to leave its elegant audience as soon as Persiani has concluded her
finale in the opera, and having deliberately entered the nearest retail
establishment, has then and there quietly imbibed a pint of half-and-
half; after which he has returned in time for the opening tableau of
Alma, and once more taken his place, with as aristocratic an air as
if he had been sipping Punch a la Romaine at Dubourg's from a
chrystal goblet, instead of draining Barclay's Entire from a pewter
pot. And yet this antithesis is not merely an attribute of the
loungers alone, for the great world abounds in similar ones. Indeed,
generally speaking, nothing is more widely different, than the dash
and show-off of individuals in society, and their manner of living
when at home. It may usually be taken in an inverse ratio.
DISTRESS OF THE COUNTRY.
Several alarming instances of the prevailing distress have reached us.
Mr. Roebuck was the other day exceedingly distressed, when the St.
James's park keeper stopped him with a parcel of books, and mistook him
for a light-porter. -
Mr. Muntz declared that he felt uncommonly distressed—at finding
three grey hairs in his whiskers.
During the late gales his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales has been
exceedingly distressed—with hiccups.

SONGS OF THE SEEDY.—No. XVIII.
Oh, deem not my spirits are buoyant and gay :
Northink that my heart is as light as thine own ;—
Oh, trust not, I charge thee, to outward display,
But wait till the innermost feelings are known.
For the heart may be gloomy, though smiles may be seen
On the visage with gladness apparently bright;
As the shirt may in collar be perfectly clean,
While the wristbands, all so dingy, are kept out of sight.
Oh, it is not what's uppermost always will show
The state of the feeling that's passing beneath;
For the cheek may be tinged with a warm sunny glow,
While the spirits are wearing the pale hue of death.
The bosom may languish, though smiles light the cheek,
And grief may in merriment often be found,
As the boot's upper leather no crack may bespeak, "
While the sole is all gone, and the foot's on the ground.
THE NATURAL HISTORY OF COURTSHIP.
CHAPTER IV.-ON THE ART of MARING THE AMIABLE.
tº slº T.
º T N.
º P
HE witty Voltaire hath
remarked “Quand celui
qui écoute n'entend rien,
et celui qui parle n'en-
tend plus, c'est méta-
physique.” Now as I am
going to be extremely
metaphysical in a few fu-
ture passages, those of
my readers who have no
taste for what neither
they nor myself very
clearly understand had
better skip the suspicious
paragraphs. These ma
|
be easily detected by the
long words.
Youth, the age of love, is also the age of inexperience—when the
eyes and ears do duty for reasoning and judgment, when the man
of pleasing manners and polished exterior is mistaken for the man
of excellent disposition,--when the cardinal virtues are thought to
be sheltered under the bows and graces of good breeding, and bright
Honour herself to reside amidst white waistcoats and kid gloves;
when the learned or talented are voted bores, and smatterers or small-
talkers declared to be learned.
Therefore, O ye makers of love, gild yourselves well over with
what is called a “pleasing exterior,” even if within you be as mere
gingerbread.
Having put on the outward visible signs of amiability, the inward
and spiritual graces may be made to shine sufficiently bright to
dazzle the eyes of most damsels by strict attention to one golden
rule:–always place yourself on a lerel with your chosen fair in intellect, and
below her in all else. Never be wiser or more clever; always be less
accomplished. On no account conquer at chess or cards, and if you
can manage to cheat yourself for fear you should win, do so. Be
careful not to offer the shadow of dissent to anything she says, unless
it be some glaring absurdity;-such as praising Bulwer's Novels for
their morality, or Ainsworth's Newgate Romances for their tasteful
decency. Should you, however, have occasion to disagree with what
she advances, the utmost tact must be called up to conceñl a flat con-
tradiction under the gossamer wings of a delicate difference of
opinion. Of this sort of tact Don Quixote supplied one of the best
examples I can call to mind:—The Princess Micomicona having
fallen into an egregious geographical blunder about a seaport, the
knight-errant, not to correct her too coarsely, simply opined that it
would have been much better if her ladyship, after her long voyage,
had not landed at Ossuara, “seeing that it happens to be an inland
town.”
Whenever there are opportunities, a little quizzing will, in most
instances, have a desirable effect; especially if the quizzed be a par-
ticular friend of the belle you are addressing, who will most likely
convert all that is said against another into compliments on herself.
The cleverest fellow I know at this is Frank Kennedy, who made
immense way with Miss Rose Robinson at the IHonourable Mrs.
Couple's last soirée, to the utter discomfiture of Sir Charles Simper,
until the chaperon, finding the flirtation was getting on too fast,
raised the Baronet's hopes by a counter-move in her game.
Frank had just handed Julia to her seat when Miss Barbara Boulder
passed.
“Do you think Miss Boulder pretty 1" inquired the belle.
“As an angel!” replied Kennedy, ironically.
“Indeed 1" was the lady's interjection.
“Are not her cheeks of roseate hue?” continued the beau, in a con-
fidential whisper, as he seated himself; “and, though from their size
they may be likened to the cabbage-rose, yet does not that brilliant
colour extend even to her neck "
“For shame, Mr. Kennedy Can you find none of the lily in her
complexion ?”
“O yes!—in her lips 1”
“White lips ? I am shocked. She is my most intimate friend.
Well, you cannot deny she has fine eyes?”
“I have no doubt of it. But one can hardly see them, almost con-
cealed as they are by her ‘cheeks rotund.’”
“Now really this is too bad tº exclaimed Miss Robinson; “you
make the poor girl out a perfect fright.—At least she has a good
figure ?”
“— would have, possibly, but for her shoulders, which unfortu-
nately make her appear like a skalene triangle, with no two sides
alike l’”
“I don't exactly know what the triangle you mention is—doubt-
less something hideous—but did you ever dance with Miss Boulder
—she is an extremely agreeable girl.”
Frank turned towards the fair speaker with a look of great asto-
uishment, and asked “Does she ever dance "
At this moment Mrs. Couple led up Sir Charles, and as Rose slid
away to be his partner in the next quadrille, she mentally exclaimed,
“really that Mr. Kennedy seems a most amiable person 1"
Custom hath instituted several topics of conversation to be carried
on by persons who have met for the first time, which tend very
materially towards playing the amiable. The first information to get
possession of is, some hint of the lady's tastes. Therefore it hath
been wisely ordained, wherever two individuals of opposite sexes are
standing side by side, that during the pauses of “the figure,” or
y|otherwise, the gentleman shall ask the lady if she be fond of dancing;
the reply will be, “Yes, very;” for it is known to be an unvarying
rule that all young ladies are fond of dancing. That, therefore,
affords no clue, nor indeed much subject for converse; hence another
question succeeds, “Are you fond of music " Answer, without ex-
ception, “Yes,”—general rule as before; but when the rejoinder comes
“What instrument do you play " although the reply in that case
always made and provided is, “the piano,” yet the mention of a few
composer's names will soon inform you of the kind of musical taste
the fair one possesses. If she admire Herz, you will know she
belongs to the thunder-and-lightning school of “fine players;” there-
fore, breathe not the names of Mozart, Beethoven, or Cramer.
Should she own to singing, and call Mercadante “grand,” or Doni-
zetti “exquisite,” do not mention Weber, or Schubert, but say a word
or two in favour of Alexander Lee.
It will, in all probability happen, that after you have complied
with the rule above stated, by asking the first two questions, the con-
versation will come to a dead stand, and the lady will be lookin
with great intensity upon the pattern of the carpet. This will affor
an admirable opportunity for inquiring into the state of her taste for
the fine arts. If she have not been to “the Exhibition” (for you will
be sure to ask herif she have), drop the subject at once; if otherwise,
and she praises the portraits and laughs at Turner, say a few words
about Poonah painting, and inquire the practicability of squaring off
one of Rembrandt's pictures for a Berlin-wool pattern.
It will frequently occur that (always excepting the first two
queries) a young lady will answer your questions with indifference-
almost contempt—in the belief that you are avery common-place soul-
less person. She, you will find to have a tinge of romance in her cha-
racter; therefore, lose not a moment in plunging over head-and-ears
into a talk about poetry. Should Byron or Wordsworth fail, try T.
K. Hervey, or Barry Cornwall, but Moore is most strongly recom-
mended. If you think you can trust yourself to do a little poetry on
your own account, dash it slightly with metaphysics. Wherever
you discover a tinge of blueism or romance, the mixture of “the
moon,” “the stars” and “the human mind,” with common conversa-
tion, is highly efficacious. When the latter predominates in the
damsel, an effective parting speech may be quoted from Romeo and
Juliet, which will bring in a reflection upon the short duration of the
happiness you have enjoyed, and the quotation
“Incver knew a young gazelle,” &c.

To make the amiable in earnest you must persevere in getting into
your fair one's set, even if you have never met her but once. Con-
trive your conversation so that it shall ooze out when she is going to
the theatre or opera, and fail not to appear there; and when she
beholds you, she shall exclaim, “What amiable perseverance " Cun-
ningly make a friend of the hostess of the house at which you first
met her, and she will, in all possibility, help your designs. By these
means you will be enabled to ascertain her daily movements, and to
meet her “by accident " very frequently, when you must always

bow; though it may be dangerous to speak, unless you have a friend
with you. In that case boldly stop and introduce him.
Should the lady be stepping from a shop to her carriage, leave your
companion, and lead her to it. - You will thus get possession for one
instant of her hand. That instant ought to be decisive 1
Having obtaincă a slight footing in the desired circle, it is not un-
likely that when you meet, little “wishes” will drop from the maiden;
such as, “I wish papa would take us to Signor So-and-So's Concert,
or to the Opera next Saturday.” As you value success, send tickets
for one, or a box for the other—fºur tickets, if the party consist of
three, with a polite apology for forwarding so many admissions,
“thinking that there may be some friend whom they would wish to
take.” As you seal the note, you naturally say to yourself, “that
friend ought to be me.” Direct your missive to the young lady her-
self, for even if they don't “take” you, she must send an answer,
which at once opens a correspondence. Anything not easily procured,
such as an Almack's voucher, a Chamberlain's court-day ticket, or a
permission to see the rehearsal of a new tragedy, make the greatest
way. Pelham Plumer (who by the way has now regularly established
himself at “No. 96 in the Square”) assures me that he received his
first decided encouragement from Miss Murray, when he procured
tickets for the Painted Chambers for her and her cousins to see the
Queen open Parliament.
The other means and appliances for making the amiable may be
safely left to the ingenuity of the courtier; the above being the
most important.
THE LAY OF THE TROUBADOUR. •
“Wake up, wake up, my beautiful, and welcome in the May,
Unfold thy veiny eyelids to salute the joyous day:
The lark's Spring gush of melody is trilling through the skies,
And all is bursting into life—my beautiful, arise!
“The warm scent-laden zephyr bows to kiss the teeming earth,
And wake the trembling harebells to a fairy peal of mirth,
Awaiting but the sunlight of thy blue and shining eyes,
And I am here—thy only love—arise—sweet-heart, arise !”
Hush’d was the strain, the Troubadour awaited a reply;
When forth an old man thrust his head, and thus in wrath did cry:
“You saucy scoundrel, hold your row—this noisy bawling cease,
Or I'll send you off to Bow-street, with an escort of police.”

CRicket.—The great match between the boy in the pinafore and the pupil
of the Greencoat School, came off on Kennington Common one day last week,
when there was a very numerous attendance, but the match excited very
little attention. The wicket consisted of a beaver hat, and it was agreed,
without reference to the regulations of the Marylebone club, that the ball
must remain in the hat in order to determine the duration of an innings.
Pinafore was decidedly the favourite, and the match had proceeded to
some extent when the ball having been knocked beyond the palings, was
most cruelly smugged by a youth in velveteen, who made off with it. The
match is postponed sine die. An attempt was made to proceed with a
round stone, but this having struck against an individual passing, the
police were appealed to, and this luminary of the bat and stumps having
been subjected to escheat, is now in the hands of the authorities.
A Fixed-tan.
| MARBLEs.-The preliminaries of the great match between the St. Anne's
and St. James's Marble Associations, were finally settled on Saturday night
\ at Pitt's Warehouse.
| The parties have deposited four pence for a supply of ring taws, and a
quantity of pots, all of which will be brought into play should the match
eventually take place, which is now only delayed by a question as to the
ground it is to be played upon. The beadle has been sounded on the
subject of St. Martin's Church Yard, but his answer was short and un-
satisfactory. The space at the back of the National Gallery has also been
named, but as this is a matter depending much upon the temper of the
military authority who happens at the moment to be upon guard, it is
impossible to speak with any certainty. But all parties are on
The “REY wive.”
Racing.—The “Atlas” and the “Emperor" ran a dead heat down
Parliament Street, and the latter was eventually backed to run against
the former, which it did at the expense of a passenger, who received the
| pole of the Atlas on his own shoulder. A cabman entered for the Cup
given by the landlord of the Hero of Waterloo; but when called upon
to start was not to be found, and the affair ended in a walk over—on the
part of a passenger who intended riding.
SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.
The Bachelor arrived athwart the bows of the Philip, and the captain
and crew were immediately paid off by the captain and crew of the latter.
A CUTTInG out affairt.
The Richmond steamer fell in with the piles of Battersea Bridge, and
the passengers being in want of assistance, sent forth a storm of hail,
which was utterly ineffectual. The noble craft drifted down with the
tide, and ultimately came to a safe muddage in the soil of Hungerford.
EXIT IN FUMO.
The Earl of Glengall presented a petition from the City, complaining of
its own smoke—the various factories, steamers, &c., injuring its public
buildings. Another petition is in course of signature for the total aboli-
tion, of cigar smoking, and vapouring of all descriptions. Captain Bo-
badil Boldero, and Grantley Berkely, will, therefore, be obliged to evapo-
rate from St. Stephen's, in their own smoke.

PUNCH'S GUIDE TO THE WATERING PLACES.
BOULOGNE-SUR-MER.
This marine city stands in proud opposition (almost) to Dover, being
very fortunately separated from that cinque port by the British Channel.
On serene days, the chalk cliffs, ingeniously representing the national
debt of England, may be seen from Boulogne heights by the naked eye;
which, however, receives additional strength, if decently clothed with a
telescope. The inhabitants of Boulogne, with an elaborate desire to culti-
vate the acquaintance of the English, have advanced a pier so far into the
channel, that if the advance were only met with corresponding enthusiasm
by the people of Dover, there would be a wooden union between the two
countries. Their enthusiasm is, of course, in every way repressed by the
Steam Navigation Companies, who, with a fine patriotism, charge the
highest possible fares, for the noble purpose of keeping Englishmen at
home, that they may spend their money in their own country. This pur-
pose has met with §. highest success for the present season, 1842.
On arriving at Boulogne, the visitor will be immediately struck with the
affability and amiable curiosity displayed by our “natural enemies.” Set-
ting his foot upon the pier, the visitor observes his path defined for him
by two ropes, leading from the vessel to the hospitable door of a mansion,
not particularly remarkable for
architectural magnificence, but re-
commended by the urbanity to be
found (with a pen in its hand)
within. To this abode you are
*~1– urged by something wearing a
- cocked hat and a sword—cocked
Q7. hats and swords ruling and direct-
ſº ing all things in France. You
yº - enter the mansion; and should
you carry (it being night) a comb and tooth-brush, such implements are
minutely inspected by another cocked hat and sword, and returned to
you with a direction to pass on. You next present yourself to a gentle-
man, who in the blandest manner makes the following inquiries, writing
down your response to each:-
“What is your name : *—“Your age 1"—“Where do you put up tº
—“What money have you in your pocket : *-* Does your mother
know you have left England "-" How is your aunt "-" Have you
had the small pox?”—“Do you take your brandy cold without !”—
and other household and pleasingly familiar interrogatives; your
answers to which are carefully deposited with the archives of the town,
and will one day make part and parcel of the history of France. Leaving
this inquiring gentleman, you are immediately introduced, through a back
door, to the city of Boulogne. Should you however appear, to the eye of
another cocked hat and sword, to have a contraband look, you are turned
into an inner room, and are from head to foot rubbed down by the half-
military (and certainly) half-
civil hand of France.
Having been well sham-
pooed for smuggled goods,
you are next requested to
open your mouth, that it
may be seen you have
neither pig-tail nor pig-
iron concealed there; both
articles bearing the heaviest s
duty. Many quids have,
from time to time, been
seized in this way, and sold
by the government to the
towns-people, with other *-
contraband articles. Should your wife accompany you, the partner of
your bosom, may be restored to your arms with many bobbins broken;
the female officers (without cocked hats and swords) asserting the right of
search with very little respect for the English flannel and linen trade.
Escaped from the Custom House, you are immediately impressed with
a sense of the large hospitality of Boulogne; a complete pack of cards, held
by fifty-two different hands,
being presented to you, ac-
companied with the loudest
and most pressing invitations
to take up your abode under
, all the fifty-two roofs. Others
cautiously invite you to pro-
- ceed to Paris; you are, how-
- ever, come to enjoy yourself
at Boulogne, and taking three steps from the Custom House, you find
yourself comfortably seated in—The BedroRd.
Well, you have quaffed a bottle of Mr. Lowe's very excellent St. Julien,
and you start with PUNch for your philosophic and most
veracious guide to see the marvels of the city. Passing 2
along the Port, your admiration is excited by the picturesque / WA
costume of the fishwomen, who have, in the most faithful A 2.
manne", copied the dress of Miss Kelly, as frequently ºf
worn by her in domestic dramas at the late English Opera
House. These women have one extraordinary peculiarity
— truthfulness. They always deal at a fixed price; never,
in any instance, consenting to take one sous less than their
original demand. The prolonged melodious note with
which some of them cry “oysters” is not among the least
attractions of the city. As a stranger, you may think it
~/? the voice of a cockatoo, whereas, it is in reality, “natives”
cried in French—
“Des Huitre—e—e—e—e—e—e—e—e—e—e—s *
Proceeding from the Port, you enter Crown-street, which
the Boulognais, however, with a pardonable prejudice
insist upon calling Rue de l'Ecu. This is the Bond-street
of Boulogne, where the English air themselves at least
once a morning. Here are many magnificent repositories,
called, by the natives, boutiques; and it affords no small
consolation to the Briton exiled, it may be, for four-and-twenty hours
from London, to read in the various windows the following soul-cheering
intelligence :-
“Englishk spokN hrane.”
On your right is the Café Vermont, a splendid establishment, where La
Jeune France may be seen playing écarté over four-sous beer at ten in
the morning. Journeying onward, to your left is a magnificent evidence
of the encouragement of English literature by the French nation, the
dreadful impositions committed by Messrs. Murray, Longman and Co.,
Colburn, Bentley, &c., being beautifully rebuked by Messieurs Baudry
and Galignani; those spirited publishers issuing, as may be seen in their
agent's, (M. Watel's) windows—
“LADY BlessingtoN–oNLY 4s. !”—
whereas her ladyship is generally at a guinea and a half in London. The
effect of this dissemination of British literature is such, that even French
children have every requisite command of the English language ; we
having frequently met with the merest urchins who, without hesitation,
and with the purest accent, have said—
“Give me a sous !”
Wending our way along the street, we glance through the windows of
the Hôtel du Nord, and, in knives and forks
laid for fifty, with serviettes folded after the
imperial, cocked hat, see the strongest illus-
tration of human hope—ten, perhaps, may dine.
We now approach the source of much of
the harmony of Boulogne—the music and
piano-warehouse of the enterprising and
obliging Solis; not yet, we trust, forgotten by
those who, a quarter of a century ago,
enjoyed his artless strains at the Surrey. This
is a magnificent repository. Here melody
may be hired by the month or quarter; and
young ladies assisted up the gamut with all
possible celerity by the proprietor. To
Solis foreign masters are much indebted.
Into how many respectable circles has
he introduced HERz And then, how
courteously putteth he off galopades
upon young ladies—how pleasingly he
insinuateth a love-song (“the very last
as is out”) into the bosoms of families :
* \ ^ We are therefore glad to see him with
that sunny look, gazing on the poultry, in his opposite neighbour's win-
dows, and may be selecting to himself the greatest goose—(and there
are none greater in all Boulogne, which is saying much for Mr. Wood,
the poulterer)—for his Sunday’s dinner!

the highway to Paris. There is, however, nothing particularly striking on
s
the road, if we except Louis Napoleon's eagle, at the
present mol lent lodging at an abattoir, or slaughter-
house ; by to means the first time that the imperial
eagle of Fr nce has kept company with butchers. To
save you a ong walk, we here present you with a por-
trait of the bird; it must be confessed not in the highest
feather.
Arrived at the end of the Rue de l’Ecu, turn to your ºf
left, and m ignificent is the prospect that greets you !—
the Grande Rue, with its bold precipitous ascent to the
ramparts that girdle the Haute Wille (in plain English,
High Town); on your right the Market-place, with Flora,
Pomona, and the Goddess of Poultry (who, we suppose, by virtue of her
peacock, must be Juno)—all presiding at their plenteous, yet economic
stalls, where it is passing sweet to purchase fivepenny cauliflowers for
three sous, and most respectable ducks for tempence English Beautifully
snowy is the cloud of caps now waving, now, succinctly clinging to the
heads of the market-women Most jaunty their boddices—picturesque
their petticoats |
Climbing the Grande Rue, you suddenly pause, and with a grateful
spirit for the blessings of an English press in France, do homage to the
office (on your right) of
“The BouloGNE GAzETTE,”
that, with its intelligence and refined humanities, gladdens every otherwise
dull and desolate Monday.
You enter the Haute Ville, passing through a venerable gateway, reso-
lutely guarded by a hero of the line for only five sous per diem. You
ascend the ramparts, and command a magnificent prospect of ocean, river,
mountain, house-top, valley, and, it may be, a squadron of the national
cavalry caracolling on the esplanade beneath. From this favoured spot
you have also the earliest glimpse of the estafette as it arrives from Calais.
We have now to speak of the historical origin of Boulogne. It is
agreed upon all hands to be of Roman foundation—
a fact made indisputable by the very fine Roman
Noses (a sample of which we give) to be still met with
on the faces of the children. Julius Caesar sent an
illegitimate son to a boarding-school here; the child's
silver spoon, fork, and six towels having been
recently dug up, with other Roman antiquities, on
the site of the ancient academy.
The public buildings of Boulogne are numerous
and magnificent. The Wooden Pier will be an
- oak ; whilst the refined beauty of the New Custom
House will no less indicate the loveliness of French polish. The Pass-
port Office, where people are ticketed for travel, has a modest but most
cheerful appearance. It is chastely whitewashed within, and ditto without.
The Church of St. Nicholas is happily situated in the Market Place : its
religious influence on the consciences of the market-people is delightfully
evident; the hucksters never asking a franc and taking ten sous-no
never.
The Museum is a splendid fabric, and contains many astounding curi-
osities. We cannot swell our notice into a catalogue, so must therefore
content ourselves with naming two or three of the principal wonders:–
The First Thought of Napoleon to invade England, hermetically sealed
in a large bottle.
The Second Ditto, to leave her alone—in a very small phial.
The Mummy of a French lodging-house keeper, who refused to make
money of the English. (This specimen is supposed to be unique.
The public spirit of the townspeople of Boulogne, cut in flint. (This
rarity is, however, so minutely executed, that it requires the very strongest
microscope to catch a glimpse of it.)
The building contains a fine Picture Gallery.
historical paintings is one celebrating
Amongst the noblest
NApoleoN's FIRST supper AT ST. JAMEs's PALACE—GEORGE THE THIRD,
with salvert UNDER his ARM, waiting UPON THE CONQUEROR.
The supper never took place, but that was no fault of the painter. .
The walls of the Haute Ville are very ancient, and are kept in repair
with extraordinary vigilance; at least two hods of mortar having been laid
out upon them during the late war panic. Henry the Eighth bombarded
them with leather guns, sewed by the Royal Cordovan Artillery. In the
Haute Ville a new cathedral is majestically rising from the earth ; and as
two men and a boy are almost constantly employed upon the fabric, the
immortal evidence of the indestructibility of French ||
reader may imagine how very soon it will be completed. A roomy and
most commodious Prison is also added to the many hospitalities of Bou-
logne. In this place—according to the benevolence of the Code Napoleon
—liberty is valued to an Englishman as worth one franc (i.e. tenpence)
a year: every Englishman owing a hundred francs to a French creditor,
being imprisonable for only one century !
The Château is a venerable and picturesque building, usually dedicated
to a company of infantry, and to such state prisoners as may wish for
celebrity. Louis Napoleon and his friends endured the rigours of this
place. The marks still visible of their champagne corks on the ceiling
demand a tear from the sympathetic.
The Cemetery lies a little way beyond the High Tower. This solemn
place is a favourite lounge for the English travellers, who generally provide
themselves with sandwiches and bottled stout ere visiting it. A pillar,
generally supposed to be erected to the memory of 72 English convicts, is
erected here. The purpose of the pillar has been misrepresented : it
having been expressly raised for the convenience of those British visitors
who would leave their names and addresses behind them. We copy two,
from about ten thousand inscribed on the monument:—
“John Rogers was here with Mary Green, June 3, 1840.”
“Peter Gillstrorthy, paper-hanger, Shoreditch.”
Wreaths of immortelles are sold at the cemetery gate:
they are composed of flowers of a bright mustard
colour, and are manufactured as offerings for the
dead. We are particular in stating this, as we
once met an English lady from Ratcliffe Highway,
who had purchased the yellow wreath as a Sunday
collar for her dog Snap!
The Column, commemorative of the non-invasion
of England, holds a grand position on the cliffs. . Its
.. base is most appropriate, being composed of a bottle of
Imperial Pop with Napoleon the Great elevated to
the skies by the froth which is ascending from it.
There are two or three convents, besides religious
houses, dedicated to the Sisters of Charity, (and
reader, when in your walks you meet these noble
creatures, bow spiritually to them as good and gracious
ministrants—angels to the sick, and comforters to the
sore in heart.)
The colleges and minor English schools demand a
– constant admiration ; and the British breast will throb
– and glow with national pride as he sees the streets

fifty times a day. The number of these schools has, however, awakened
the jealousy of the French government; and feeling that Boulogne
might be taken by a simultaneous rising of even parlour-boarders, every
school is commanded by a French battery ; masked, and, therefore, not
visible.
The amusements of Boulogne are as numerous as refined :—hunting,
bathing, and donkey-riding ; let us speak of the balls at the baths—the
lotteries for the poor—the playhouse—the manoeuvres of the national
guards (horse and foot), both forces meeting the first Sunday in every
month, weather permitting. It is, however, in the contemplation of the
authorities, to add an umbrella to their other arms of defence.
In autumn there is a solemn blessing . .

said, the multitude of fish—we pre- \ ^
sume English flat-fish—wafted º
the tides from London Bridge Wharf, \, \ }
and Dover, to the hotels and shops
of Boulogne.
One of the most remarkable and
pleasing peculiarities of this delight-
ful place, is the feeling of charity
pervading all the English residents.
Here there is no backbiting, no
slander, no petty scandal; but Mon-
day, being a non-post day, that day is generally devoted to a discovery
and praise of everybody's good gifts, and virtues. People meet and
linger at the corners of streets for no other purpose.
From an old seal recently found, it is contested that the arms of the
city were originally a swan ; but we have heard antiquaries, who have
visited some of the Boulogne hotels, declare the bird must be a cor-
morant.
The English inhabitants are composed of those who are living on their
means, and those who are living in despite of them. However, to give a
romantic air to society, there may be, occasionally, a slight sprinkling of

Outlaws, however, are sometimes made at a very economic rate ; and
without the remotest notion of the appalling civil change they are gra-
dually undergoing. This, however, depends upon the extreme ingenuity
and fine usurious malice of the operator in England. We have, however,
a very pretty article of outlawry turned out of hand for not above 30l.--
a gratifying fact for those who would deal in the manufactory of such
pleasant ware. Having given the outlaw's haunts, we now subjoin his
weapons.
We have no space to linger on the outlaw's habits. It may suffice to the
curious to know that he ordinarily rises about seven—takes coffee at
eight—lunches at noon—broods over “previous mischief" until about
two—then prowls about the city and environs until four-dines at six—
takes tea (think of “the outlaw's tea—bohea, shrimps, and devilry,”)—
plots more mischief until ten or eleven; and then woos sleep to his guilty
couch, snoring, if possible, till seven of the morrow. But let us quit the
dreadful theme, as we want a government “permit" to depart for
England.
Now, reader, if you go to the office on the Port—the white-washed
edifice—you will have a licence to depart from La Belle France for no-
thing ; but if you would assert yourself a Briton, and feel what it is to
have a Briton's protection, you will go to your consul, who for the same
“ permit” will charge you

MARGATE.
“On Thanet's northern bounds fair Margate stands;
Delightful views it every way commands.”
Thus sings Master Peter Theophilus Turner, the poet and pedagogue,
the votary of the Muse and Mavor, whose tuneful goosequill has produced
a Guide to Margate, as immortal, and as easy and comprehensive as that
of Dr. Dilworth to the English language. Tremblingly do we approach
the task of reducing his glowing imagery—his daring and sublime meta-
phors into the coldness of prosy reality—but the demands of Punch are
imperative, and so here goes.
eter Theophilus assures us that Margate is “a place where thousand
goddesses appear,” who we presume have all come down by the Red Rover
- from Elysium, or perhaps the Minories;–the
Thanet goddesses having complexions which
induce us to imagine that their customary be-
verage is less of the divine nectar of Olympus
than the brown stout of Dublin.
Peter Theophilus further informs us that—
“Here music, love, and poetry combine—”
the music doubtlessly refers to that of a
librarian vocalist, who sings “a song, and ac-
companies himself on six cocoa-nut shells;”
—the love to that high state of feeling exhi-
bited by young ladies and gentlemen at moon-
light and low-water on the sands;–the poetry
captain or the to Peter Theophilus's own desscriptive poem,
axd Roven, which, in the words of P. T. T., seeks to

“ensure to the visitors and inhabitants of Margate a complete, correct,
and delighting guide. Information respecting carriage and steam convey
ance being placed at the end of the poetry for convenience to the con
tinued and more sublime strain of i. Muse.” The Margate Warbler
continues—
“Here trembling ague, burning fever find
They dare not once assault, if so inclincá ;
His bloated or her pallid face she (Hygeia) hides,
Buried for e'er beneath the genial tides.”
If Peter Theophilus had not taken out a poetic license, we should say
that bathing at Margate was rather unpleasant ; for according to his account
Mr. Fever “with his bloated,” and Mrs. Ague with “her pallid face,”
seem to have taken the whole of the ground floor of the Ocean there.

Peter Thº. appends the following note to the preceding beautiful
quatrain:—“Thousands can testify the truth of these observations, for
we annually see many who come to Margate, even on crutches, after
bathing a few weeks, not only throw aside their auriliary legs, but are
restored to such health and florid countenances, that scarcely their most
intimate friends can recognize them.” To confirm the truth of Peter's
panegyric, we present a copy of a certificate which we felt it our
duty to leave with our Margate merman, Mr.
Hubbard :-
“One-bed House, Margate.
“S1E,--I beg to say that I came down to Margate,
afflicted with a violent running in my legs, occasioned by a
dubious tailor and a sheriff's officer; and, after takin
course of six of your machines, I had the happiness to find
my general º: so improved, that my dearest cre-
ditor did not know me,
“For the sake of those similarly afflicted, and who have
an objection to whitewashing and other violent remedies, I
beg that you will give publicity to the above.
“As witness my leg this 9th day of July, 1842.
“Punch.”
- Of the situation of Margate, we cannot do
better than extract the highly geographical, and very satisfactory account
given by our dear Peter Theophilus, who says–
“Margate, Metropolis of this famed isle,
Is placed where Zephyrs blow and Naiads smile.”
We have consulted the Maps published by the S. D.U. K., and have not
been able to find out the exact latitude and º: for the blowings and
smilings alluded to by Peter. We fear that this meteorological mapping
must have been executed on a half-holiday during the summer solstice;
for, had it been done in the brumal quarter, he must have described it as
a town which was bounded on one side by a hurricane and on the otli",
by a deluge.
“But stop, my pen and cease thy general song,
And tell what to each object does belong.”
In pursuance of which determination of the poetic Peter's, we have p
the drag upon our general pen, and proceed to particulars.
The Pier.—We found, upon inquiry, that the original wooden quay w
raised to the pierage in 1815, and now forms an elegant and commodious
harbour for small pleasure-boats and sea-sick Cockney, emigrants. The
Pier consists of two elevations, the lower and inner of which constitutes a
quay for the landing of shrimps and carpet-bags; the higher and outer
one forms a promenade for buff slippers
and a lounge for telescopes. At the sea-
ward extremity is a long Roman candle,
which, when lighted and reflected in the
water at its base, strongly reminds one of
a gigantic rushlight erected for the accom-
tlir Marugate eur Fs.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARſ.
modation of such visitors to the Port of Margate as are afraid to sleep so
near the sea without a night-lamp. A semicircular projection, resembling
a capacious nursery fender, has been erected for two fiddles and a flute,
or the purpose of drawing out the millinery, and introducing Strauss's
New Waltzes, as soon as published, to the notice of the surrounding
Mermaids.
JAR vis's LANDING-PLAce, better known as the Jetty, is a kind of Marine
- Tavistock Hotel, where steamers may have a good
bed in the ocean, when they are locked out of the
harbour for the night. The sides of the Jetty are
celebrated as juvenile crab-fisheries. Here nume-
rous little boys may be seen with a skait's tail and
a bit of whipcord, endeavouring to catch a crab and
a nightmare. The crustacea about the Jetty are
of excellent quality, being generally fatted upon
the youthful anglers whose nursery-maids are
more attentive to the love-yarns of the sailors
than to the safety of their young masters. The
“Landing-place” is resorted to by meat ancles in
windy weather, and many a pretty leg has been
known to walk from thence into a young gen-
tleman's affections, and off to Gretna.
There is–wind and weather permitting—a strong muster of jobbing-
sailors upon the Jetty, who politely invite you to “take a sail,” which being
freely translated means, “take an emetic.” Under the guidance of these
indigenous T. P. Cookes, you may, if the bosom of the ocean be as placid
as a feather-bed, have an opportunity of
fishing for your dinner; and if the sport
Mandate costuai Es.
be very good, may be fortunate enough
to catch two penny dabs in the same
number of hours for the same number
of shillings. There is also a fine moral
lessºn to be learned in the sailing-boats
of Margate, for nothing exhibits the
Yanity of human hope more forcibly than a party of sixteen in “The
Hero,” embarked at 1s. per head, in the pursuit of pleasure. No sooner
have they had sixpennyworth of the sea than a change of opinion as to
the enjoyment of navigation takes place, and the gallant crew are ready
tº compºund with the sailing-master, and take a dividend of the distance
due to them, and ultimately become so disgusted with that peculiar style
of nautical agriculture called Ploughing the ocean, that they make a uni-
versal demand, that either they or the anchor be let go in the middle of
the British Channel.
Leaving the Jetty, and engaging in an earnest conversation with your
friends in the rear, the first object which will strike your eye will be the
Puxtº-handle, which is attached to a beautiful erection of cast-iron,
said to be a model of the Lanthorn of Diogenes at Athens; but as no one
who had the least acquaintance with the tºwn was likely to use the lan-
thorn in Margate for the same purpose as the Cynic did, in Greece, the
pier-directors very wisely have con-
verted it into a pump, so that every
visitor might take water at the pier if he
liked.
Proceeding onwards, you will require
to use your stick or umbrella as a flapper,
to keep off the “flies,” which will now beset you. Having forced your
way through the swarm, you will find yºurs if
introduced to a large family of family hotels;
which our own Peter proceeds to poetise upon,
in grammar, which, we are happy to say, for
the sake of his originality, is no base plagiarism
from Lindley Murray. o
Presuming that you decline the attractions
and bills of these Temples of Heliogabalus,
ºnd determine to go in search of Desirable
Lodgings,' you proceed with your head and lug-
gage in the direction of High-street; on the
seaward side of which your attention should be
directed to the statue of a nigger Neptune, with a -

a red herring, which is struggling at is feet; Tsº

tail is ingeniously converted into a camp-stool for
the convenience of the Ocean Deity. Passing
onwards, you find yourself an object
of intense interest to the touters of
Messrs. Hubbard, Phillpot, Beale,
Wood, Crickett, et id genus who—but
let Peter Theophilus warble their vocal
tion and habitation :-
44 Along the borders of the western strand,
In High-street, many bathing houses stand ;
Though thus they're named, they are not strictly so,
They're only places where the jathers go!!”
Grateſul for this valuable information, you continue your peregrination
in quest of a hearth at the sea-side, and are astonished to find that there
is “one Bed to LET’’ in every other window, from which you infer, that
if the generality of Margate visitors dine at home, they must use a sheet
for a table-cloth. If you wish for a suite of apartments, you should be
regulated not only by the amount of the rental, but also by the number of
the landlady's far:ily; for rest assured that the profit of your three-months’
stay will have to provide food and raiment for the lodging-house keeper
and her young all the rest of the year.
----------- After a glance at the Albert Saloon, where you
- may be done in “this style for a shilling,” you may
proceed to Hales's Library, which is a beautiful
structure highly characteristic, in its exterior, of
the articles which form the attraction within. It
strongly resembles a Tonbridge-ware work-box,
surmounted by an inverted humming-top. From
the miscellaneous contents of this Marine Museum,
| you may furnish the mind or a baby-house—
procure the vinaigrette, whose pungent aroma may
support you through the excitement produced by
the perusal of “Jack Sheppard ”—or select the
“trifle from Margate,” which, when in Cripplegate,
will remind you of the “Last Days of Pompeii.”
The female visitor to this “abode of Hygeia,”
- (Peter Theophilus,) and Mr. Cobb, (Punch.) are
so peculiarly literary, that a bookseems as necessary to them as a reticule,
while the subject of the novel may be considered as an infallible directory
to the dispositions of these bookworms in book muslin.
Thus, “Flirtation” is found at low
water on The Sands; “Eugene Aram,” “...
seeks subterranean enjoyment in The
º
Grotto ; “Almacks Revisited” idealises
at The Wilderness; “The Manoeuvring
Mother” promenades The Jetty, accom-
panied by “Violette” and “Henrietta
Temple.”
Margate is a fine nursery for amateur
gamesters, to whom The Wheel of Fortune
is an easy introduction to the more elabo- º
rate mysteries of the Pea and Thimble-
rig. The croupiers are evidently deeply
skilled in phrenology; for, looking round ſº
upon the heads of the players, they inva-lº
riably arrive at the conclusion that “1, 2,
3, 4, 5, and 6, are vacant l’’ and we our-
selves saw an aged widow, the mother of
six grown-up, daughters, highly excited at the possession of a mahogany
boot-jack, which, at a moderate computation, had cost the family about
thirty shillings.
You should now pop your head (and nothing more) into the Boulevards,
unless like St. Anthony you are prepared to resist the temptations of
beauty in a cayern, for you must not conceive that there is anything green
about the Boulevards but the customers.
We will now conduct you to the theatre, but as there is no chance of
your getting a view of the interior, as it was never known to be visible
fºr more than a week at a time, and as you may not be in Margate at
the precise fortunate moment, you must be contented with a glimpse of
the “properties, decorations, and scenery” of the exterior, for which we
ºre willing to be indebted to the ever-pointed pencil of the classical
Peter Theophilus—
“Simple in form, though spacious in extent,
No aid by its external plan is lent;
To court the eye or votaries bring,
Where Thalía dwells and sweetest syrens sing;
But, suited to your numbers, tastes, and wishes,
It is what scholars term simpler munditiis.”—or dishes.
Peter, who insists that Thalía is the name of the Tragic Muse, must
really excuseus if we are rude enough to throw the term liai, his teeth.
ºf you are in a melancholy mood, you cannot do better than look out a
shilling and a volume of “Young's Night Thoughts,” and proceed to Tivoli.
As our pen traces the word we feel our wit flicker in our cranium, and
grow dim as the one thread of cotton in the illumination-lamps of those

highly respectable but unhappy-looking victim, who,
though placed there to represent a money-taker,
has either been condemned to solitary confinement—
the Caspar Hauser of Margate—or who, perhaps
from a too susceptible nature, has experienced an
early blight of his affections, and has willingly sought
this desolate money-box, so that he may hold no
further communion with the world.
As the oft-repeated echo of your footstep falls upon
his ear he starts like an affrighted chamois on the
hills, and wonders what melancholy mission can have
brought you to this cemetery of mirth. Thrusting

to his cell you deposit your charitable donation of a shilling,
and to his surprise pass on into the depths of the surround-
ing gloom, by descending a flight of steps upon which are dimly
seen some very faint luminaries strongly resembling glowworms
in the last stage of the deepest decline. You should then ignite
your cigar, and by its glare, aided by the glimmer of a single
wick in a custard-cup, suspended from a hedge-stake, grope
your way to the statue of Nox with A Night LAMP, which is
rendered nearly visible by an elaborate coating of whitewash.
Around the neck of the goddess is suspended the prayer of the
gardener, which, by the aid of a lucifer, we are enabled to trans-
cribe ; it moved us by its simplicity, and ran as follows:–
“Pray do not touch the flowers.”
The next object (if you can find it) which ought to attract your atten-
tion is—
The LARE, whose ebon waters seem to be drawn from the celebrated
reservoir at Warren's, 30, STRAND. It has been rumoured that it would
long since have been dried up, but for the heavy dues upon the property.
A hollow sound will now conduct you to the concertroom, where an incar-
cerated vocalist appears to be beguiling the tedious hours with the appro-
priate song of “I never say nothing to nobody.” This is a hallowed spot,
for here in happier days the renowned Sinclair sang his two popular
songs to two poplar trees, here in more recent times the Westris of
Kennington, and celebrated Terpsichorean evergreen, the Baron Nathan,
retired to perfect himself unobserved in some pas seul—tout seul-
perhaps his celebrated “Marine hornpipe
in top-boots,” which has since shed such
lustre upon the door-plate of his academy.
Here, too, you may find Döbler eclipsed by
some cunning professor of necromancy, who
displays the very acme of his art by borrowing
a shilling !

you are but a truant from “the pleasant Bells of Bow.”
Having prepared yourself for the visit, you you should now go to the
WildERNess, which, from its extreme effect upon the spirits, would
have been a precarious experiment before taking a dose of Tivoli.
We should, however, advise you under any circum-
stances not to venture without providing the attendance
of the bellman, for the grounds are in such perfect keeping
with their name, that you, like Ross, will require the crier
to act as a Captain Back to get you out again.

The lawn in front is ornamented with a tank of verdant water, not much
unlike a bason of Birch's green pea-soup, in the centre of which is the
snout of a syringe, which, we presume, acts as the biliary duct to a foun-
to an orchestra built after the ornamental
Vesuvius has been brought down from the Y
tain. On entering the house, your eye is arrested on the left by a table
on trestles ranged across a very bare room; and the only indications of
life or civilisation are four biscuits, three bottles of ginger-beer, and, to
balance the picture, two ditto of soda-water at the opposite end of the table.
In the centre are a few faded flowers, six Whitechapel cigars, and a
wine-glass. On a toilet-table, you perceive three pewter-pots, an Etruscan
vase, and a jug of the celebrated willow pattern, the whole ably sup-
ported by a large beer-barrel in the name of Cobb—a gentleman who
appears to hold the enviable situation of the great butt of Margate.
On looking to the right, you will see another large room, equally
bare and desolate, and apparently devoted entirely to the fine arts ;
for, on the mantelpiece, are ranged busts of Shakspeare, the Princess
Charlotte, Milton, and a lucifer-box. On ascending to the ball-room,
which is twice as long, and twice as bare, and twice as desolate as both the
others, you will observe a number of large
brackets projecting from the middle of the
wall, which have been evidently constructed
by a visionary proprietor as reserved seats
for those nights on which the room might be
crowded to excess. The eye is next directed
design of a sentry-box, the whole of which
is occupied by a grand piano and two music-
stands, and is profusely lighted at the back
by a row of twelve illumination lamps—a
drapery of crimson, which, as the ladies
say, would be all the better for another
breadth, is strained over a wooden pro-
tuberance, in which the syrens warble to
the walls.
The whole of the rooms are lighted up by
costly chandeliers of tin, constructed so as
to present to the imagination of the spectator
a vivid representation of metallic wreaths of
roses.
Having, by the assistance of the bellman, -
found your way out of the Wilderness, and arrived safely at your domicile,
ou can devote the energies of your mind to the enjoyment of the highly
intellectual amusements of Margate, which consist in a constant attend-
ance on the Pier at the arrival and departure of the London and other
steam-boats; and at the end of two months, you will perhaps find that
you have spent eight weeks and fifty pounds very agreeably.
RICHMOND.
This, which is the last of the watering places on the South-Western
coast of the Thames, is certainly not the least, and might be called
an earthly paradise, but for the enormous bill one is pretty sure to
have to pay on quitting it. This is a favourite rendezvous for
those who can enjoy the prospect of a view twenty miles round,
with the consciousness that they have in their pockets a purse
almost as many yards long to meet the inevitable contingencies. The
landlords and waiters are particularly obliging—obliging every one to
settle before quitting the premises. If private lodgings are pre-
ferred, three guineas a-week may possibly procure an attic for two,
with the use of a buggy (bedstead). There are,

MAN AND BEAst. The town of Richmond presents some very
interesting relics of stale pastry, old caricatures, and last year's
fashions in the haberdashery line, which are figuratively marked as
quite new, by the native merchants. There is a theatre in the place
which nobody can ever find, and which no one wishes to find, so that
it admits of perfect seclusion to such performers as are desirous of
practising their profession, without being made nervous by the
presence of an audience.
It is supposed that Richmond derives its name from Henry the
Seventh having made fast his footing there, after having marched into
“the bowels of the land,” which, we are told by Shakspeare he really
did, and which, if he came over Battersea Marshes, he was very likely
to do. It is true there is another Richmond in Yorkshire, and we
are reminded by this fact of the
extraordinary tact of the Bard
of Avon, who brought his great
geographical learning to bear in
the celebrated line— -
“Methinks there besir Richmonds in the ficla."
which he puts into the mouth of the frenzied tyrant Richard. The
crook-backed villain knew there were two Richmonds—one in
Surrey, the other in Yorkshire—and Shakspeare felt, that a man

driven to desperation, as Richard was at the battle of Bosworth,
might well have exaggerated two into six; and hence the bold
exclamation we have alluded to. -
The water at Richmond is very much pestered by flies—in the
summer season, and particularly by a species of horse-fly, which
attempts to fasten on the pocket, until the contents are thoroughly
drained out of it.
There are some delightful walks in the vicinity of Richmond, and
Ham Common is supposed to be so called from the uncommon quan-
tity of ham consumed by pic-nic parties on the spot referred to.
There are ordinaries every day, and there are several extra-ordi-
naries on Sundays. The prices vary from eighteen-pence and up-
wards, but the upwards decidedly predominates.
HERNE BAY
Is a juvenile town on the coast of Kent; indeed, so infantine is it, that
many of the houses are not out of their scaffold poles, whilst others have
not yet cut their windows. It is said to have originated from a drive of
an eminent capitalist, who, being the projector of all the buildings in the
place, the bay was originally called Hisn ; but since Mrs. Thwaites, the
opulent city widow, has kindly taken it under her patronage, the com-
missioners of the town insist upon calling it Hern, in acknowledgment of
which she has erected a clock-case, or tower, which seems to have been
designed after one of those rolls of brawn for which the adjacent city of
Canterbury has been for centuries so famous.
The approach to Herne Bay is by a wooden pier nearly twice the ex-
tent of the town, as the tide in these parts runs sometimes as low as the
rents. This landing-place is strongly defended by two ship guns, and
six wheelbarrows. The garrison at present consists of four ticket-porters,
who are exercised three or four times a day, under the command of a
glazed cap and a gold-laced band, in propelling a machine very
like a diligence in reduced circumstances, in which the steam-
boat passengers and luggage are conveyed at the rate of two-
pence a head, and twopence a trunk.
A number of able-bodied individuals, pass the greater part
of their time at the extremity of this pier in fishing for white
salmon, which is of such a delicate complexion, that it seems to
have swam all its life in a sea of Rowland's Kalydor.
The town of Herne Bay is not built, like others, upon hides of land,
but seems, from its mortgaged appearance, to be erected upon skins of
parchment. In fact, such is the
general aspect of the place, that
most of the buildings look like un-
redeemed pledges—as though,when
the finances of the builders became
rather shy, they had availed them-
selves of the pawnbroker's assist-
ance, and put a whole street up
the spout. Indeed, so picturesquely -
dilapidated is the whole of the of the 1 o u order.
town, that it would not require a very vivid imagination to convert
it into a Kentish Herculaneum, or the fossil remains of a Watering Place.
From the external
appearance of the
innumerable desira-
ble premises which
are placarded as for
lease or sale, there
is no doubt that the
advertisementshould
run “This valuable mansion to be let or sold, with coach-house, stable,
and a Chancery suit attached, and every other domestic convenience.
Enquire of the man in possession.”
So, great is the impatience to get rid of the property evinced in the
wording of some of the placards, that houses are offered to be let—or
sold,—furnished—or unfurnished,—with—or without grounds;–in fact,
to be taken as you please : and in one instance, such is the desperation
exhibited, that money is offered to be advanced by the landlord on his
own buildings
The principal street, which of course is called High, is about half a
mile in length, with a broad carriage-road covered with loose shingles
and grass.
In order to convey to our readers some idea of the grandeur of the
design of this Regent-street of Herne Bay, we subjoin a ground-plan,
with a description of the prospects which occasionally break upon the
delighted eye of the surveyor.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The MARKET is in perfect keeping with the rest of this very flourishing
little town. At the entrance is a list of the tolls to be paid upon the
admission of certain luxuries which could only be known to the inhabitants
of Herne Bay through the medium of a cookery book. The building has
been designed upon a most liberal scale, as if the carcases of the sur.
rounding houses were furnished with the organs of digestion; and though
the market proffers accommodation for pigs, poultry, butter, eggs, fancy
articles, sheep, cattle, horses, &c., it is at present oc-
cupied by two small greengrocers, one butcher, one
fishmonger, and a pump. The latter object stands
in the centre of the herbiferous quadrangle, and has
been evidently placed there by the commissioners in
of benevolence as conceived the formation of wells in
==
-
the same feeling
the desert.
The presiding spirit of Herne Bay, seems to be the Bellman—his thin,
spare figure harmonises beautifully with the emaciated state of the skele-
tons of the houses. His usual costume is a duffle dressing-gown, whose
original grey has faded into the smoky yellow of a London fog : and
though this evidently constitutes the Bellman's déshabiller, we never yet
had the pleasure of seeing him after his sacrifices at the toilet. His pace,
from the distance of the inhabited houses from each other, is that of a
perambulating estafette. His style of lachrymal elocution
is tri-syllabic: his lungs apparently not allowing him to
deliver more than three syllables at a time. He is prin-
cipally engaged in assuring you that there is a fresh
supply of “shrimps, lobsters, veal, mutton, lamb, beef,
and vegetables at the market,” and in offering liberal
rewards to humane individuals who will bring home
to their disconsolate masters and parents, nursery-
maids and children who have lost themselves in the wilderness of
Herne Bay.
Of the amusements of this watering place the most conspicuous is
St. GeoRGE's GARDENs AND PROMENAde, which is an enclosed gusset of
weeds and brambles, in the
centre of which stands a
stucco building, constructed
in the style of a half-bushel
measure, with an inverted
funnel on the top ; and an
estimate may be formed of
the number of the visitors
to these delightful grounds,
when we assure the reader
- that there are no less than
seven flies, and a fine large

sake of security, taken up
his residence in the key-hole
of the principal entrance.
Next in attraction are the bathing-houses, the principal of which consti-
tute the rival establishments of Forss and Hommersham.
At the former two blooming Naiads preside over the guides and towels,
and form
THE FEMALE FORSS OF HERNE BAY.
We cannot decide whether we were allured to their house by the luxury
of the bath, the urbanity of their manners, or the softness of their
towels. We are ready to confess, that our heads are still swimming
with the recollections of their beauty, and from the vacuum on the left
side of our bosoms, we are afraid that when we settled our account we
left our heart behind us. Will they oblige us by forwarding it to Wel-
lington Street, addressed “Punch,” and marked “Fragile tº
The rival establishment to this seems to have equal attractions, the
blue bottle, in the cobweb of
the spider who has, for the
sea very impartially supplying both of them
with the same salt-water and sand.
The military at Herne Bay consist of a draft
of nine invalid boys from the Duke of York’s
School, and the only time that we
saw them on duty, they were ac-
tively engaged in towelling those
bathers who seemed inclined to
resort to Forss.
The only curiosity that we were *
able to discover in Herne Bay, was a first floor —
at a lodging-house, surmounted by the muzzles
of two wooden cannons, which we conceive to be
a delicate intimation that the place could not be taken without several
severe charges.
The brandy in this locality much excels the water in quality, which we
regret to say, made us swerve from our hydropathic principles. In this
panegyric, we do not include the “smuggled,” which on the first trial
convinced us had been run all the way from Smithfield-bars.
Miss non-ºn-sila M.
Our jest is ended, and we care not to confess the pang with which we
obey the call of sterner duties, and bid adieu to this wilderness of bricks.
Our first impressions on beholding its grass-grown streets were those of
disappointment; but the kindliness—the almost hospitality of its inhabit-
ants, at once reconciled us to the place. Herne Bay, it is true, unlike its
flaunty neighbours, Ramsgate and Margate, has neither a Tivoli, a Boule-
vard, nor a Raffle, to tempt the mindless votary of display to visit its quiet
shores; but to those who love to hold communion with mature—to invoke
the shades of departed years from the tomb of Time—or to steal away from
the burning ambitions and anxieties of life, it is rich indeed . A walk of
a few minutes is rewarded by countless bursts of rural scenes, unpolluted
by the innovations of fashionable taste; whilst the arena of old memories,
consecrated both by time and the blessings they have conferred upon
mankind, are within the reach of healthful exertion.
About two miles from the Bay is the little village of Herne, a cluster of
humble homes, nestling in the midst of glade and woodland, breathing of
such primitive simplicity that the world-worn mind hungers for its quiet.
A few miles from thence, through a country, whose every plain and hill is
a page of history, is Canterbury—a city, that in itself is worth a pilgrim-
age. We walked about its streets unsconscious of the present, and only
heard and saw the memories that haunt them. The undefined, confiding
veneration of childhood stole again upon our hearts when we stood beneath
the roof of the little church dedicated to St. Martin. Its simple font
and humble chancel appeared no mockery of those holy truths which in
England were first promulgated within its walls.
The Reculvers—the monument of a sister's love—are within an even-
ing's walk of Herne Bay—(but Punch is
getting sentimental)—Here King Ethelbert
retired, when he presented his palace at
Canterbury to St. Augustin, and, hanging
up his crown on a hat-peg, and placing his
sceptre in his umbrella-stand, resolved to
enjoy his otium cum dignitate. Here—no
—the jest drowns itself in the ink, and we
must bid adieu to Herne Bay and its at-
tractions, so welcome to all those who seek
for enjoyment in other sources than excitement and ostentation.
RAMS GATE
May be considered a watering-place-of-ease to Margate.
We have
sometimes thought Margate not unlike Tottenham-court Road broken into
streets, and removed to the sea-side for the benefit of the sea air. Rams-
gate gives one the idea of Pentonville introduced to the ocean for a similar
advantage.
The appearance and manners of Ramsgate, natives and visitors, differ
very materially from the bearing of the Margateonians. There is not the
same reckless air, the same determination—
“To seize with eager strife,
Through the iron bars of life,"
all the multitudinous delights to be found, thick as pebbles, on the sea-
coast. The folks who congregate at Margate appear to have only six days
to cleanse their animal spirits from the dust and cobwebs that for the
previous three hundred and fifty-nine have hung about and clogged them
at their desks and counters; whilst the visitors of Ramsgate, in lieu of
six days, allow themselves at least a fortnight. Hence, they take pleasure
with a certain calmness—a dignity not at all compassable by their inferiors.
Ramsgate, is for the serene importance of 300l. per annum ; Margate, for
the vulgar bustle of 150l.
Ramsgate was once a small fishing hamlet, and supplied Hengist and
Horsa, on their visit to England, with anchovies; whilst, as may be secn
in Suetonius, its modest neighbour Pegwell-bay, sent its majestic shrimps
to the breakfast-table of Caligula. So much for the antiquity of the spot.

Open sea-bathing has, also at Ramsgate, its peculiar attractions. Since
compelled to limit our insertion to three letters:–
«TO PUNCH.”—No. I.
“Mn. Punch,--I am the father of three daughters; and when in Bucklers-
bury, though I say it, they are the most timid, gentle, well-behaved girls as can
be, almost screaming if a stranger chances to look at 'em. ... I have only been
here at Ramsgate eight days, and hardly know my own flesh and blood again.
The girls will haunt the sea-beach at bathing-times, and though repeatedly
warned by the gentlemen away, they only giggle, and sit all the faster.
“You, sir, are a philosopher: can you explain the reason of this? Does
sea-air always make this difference in female habits? My eldest girl, Sophonisba,
says it's the contemplation of the immensity of nature that necessarily enlarges
the intellect.—“Yours truly, PETER ALDERsgate.
“P.S.—I thought when I sat down to write that the girls were up stairs.-
No, they're on the beach again. I return to Bucklersbury to-morrow.”
“TO PUNCH.”–No. II.
“Fairnd Punch,--I am fond of swimming, and float like a cork. I find it,
however, impossible to swim or float under a battery of telescopes. Yet so it
is, I am no sooner in the water than I feel that, “by the optician's art,' I am
pulled into twenty drawing-rooms. “The glass of fashion and the world of
form' may be all very well, but not as applied at Margate. A hint from you
may help me.”—“Your Constant Reader, Jack Dolphin.”
“TO PUNCH.-No. III.
“Dean MR. Punch,--I came down to Herne Bay to remedy a defective
education: I wished to learn to swim. Here, however, I find it impossible; for
being obliged to practise somewhat close in shore, I feel I cannot do justice to
my powers, if ladies will persist, sitting with almost their ankles in water, seeming
to look, or pretending to read, “Pelham.”
“Yours ever, HENRY Blushly.
“P.S.—I enclose this to say I have made another essay, but have been driven
out of the water by four young ladies in pink bonnets. My
landlady, to whom I have complained, gives me no hope of
remedy, but has kindly offered me the use of the water-butt."
Though all these letters are not from Ramsgate, they
apply with tremendous force to a custom “that has in-
creased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished” at
that favoured watering-place. If ladies will enjoy, let
them woo the luxury in fitting place and season,
“When tide is down, and bathing hours are past.”

As for the natives of Ramsgate, they are—like the natives of most
watering-places—cannibals. They, however, have the grace of economy;
and for the whole twelvemonths live upon the lodgers caught in §:
season. Hence half-a-dozen single men are found quite sufficient to feed
a widow, and child or two for a year, if subsisting in the moderate way;
whilst the more luxurious
eaters—the owners of draw-
ing and sitting-rooms —
require husbands, wives, and
families.

we make the subjoined sketch :( FC sºlº > \-

natives of watering-places.
The amusements of Rams-
gate are few and innocent. A
frolic over a pint of shrimps at Pegwell Bay, or a rush to take a lounge at
St. Lawrence is, perhaps, the wildest outburst allowed to metropolitan dissi-
pation. We certainly saw three young men seated on the beach, who, having
selected a white stone as a mark, pelted it relentlessly with pebbles, and
thus consumed a whole morning—but such lawless characters are happily
great exceptions to the usual visitors of this favoured spot, who, eschewing
such disorder and excitement, wisely throw themselves upon
sympathis in G Fiti.e. nds.
A Truussed Lodgert.
GRAVESEND.
GRAvesend is situated on the side of a declivity which slopes gently down
to the water, except at low tide, when it terminates in a noble expanse of
mud and shingles. It is distant from London, according to the latest
steam-boat estimates—one breakfast, with shrimps, two weekly papers, and
a “Punch,” i.e., the time consumed in discussing them.
Numerous derivations have been assigned to the name of this place. In
the Doomsday Book it is written Greaves-ham, or the Town of Greaves,
possibly from furnishing that article to the Isle of Dogs. Some say it sig-
nified Graves’-end, as from the extreme salubrity of the air, deaths and
funerals are unknown ; whilst, on the other hand, it has been written
Grave-send, from the low water exhalations hurrying many people to their
last homes. In proof of this latter assertion, there are undeniable traces
of tombstones in the churchyard.
A part of Gravesend is in the adjoining parish of Milton ; but there are
no records to show that the compliment was ever returned by Milton's
residing in the parish of Gravesend. It was spoken of, in the reign of
Richard II., as a perfect Elysium ; but, not presenting any tokens of such
a place at present, it is clear that the Paradise of Milton has been lost.
The principal productions of Gravesend are—shrimps, Bank clerks,
Camero Obscuras, and furnished lodgings.
Passports.—Before landing at Gravesend, it is essential to procure a
passport. This is a small piece
of blue paper, for which a fee of
eighteen-pence is demanded by
the residentambassador on board
the steam-boat; and it must be

high, ascended by a ladder of eighteen steps, occasionally put against it.
It is surmounted by ared lantern, to warn vessels from the dangerous shoals
of oyster-shells and broken crockery which here abound.

professes to be furnished with an ordinary. This is a meal at a fixed price,

Mr. Carver associates aptly with the
object of the announcement. We may
add that the meal is well named, as"
well as the visitors, both being gene-
rally of a very ordinary description.
THE LIBRARIES are the chief attractions of all watering-places; the main
object of these resorts being apparently to get through the day as fast as
you can. Gravesend is not deficient in this respect, and a large traffic is
carried on in crockery inkstands, and German silver saltspoons, especially
towards evening. We must not forget
TULLY's Lounge, where, amidst other attractions, is to be found the
celebrated Wheel of Fortune, whence the goddess pours her benignant dis-
pensation on the metropolitan votaries. To give some idea of this mine of
luck, we may only mention that a box of soldiers, a draught-board, a packet
of soap, and an egg-glass, have all been won in a single evening.

Rosherville.—To arrive at this favoured spot, which now only wants a
few inhabitants and more houses to convert it into a smallvillage, the visitor
may walk up High-street; and then, turning to the left through King-
street, proceed for about a quarter of an hour on the Chatham-road. . It
will now be better for him to ask his way, when he will find that he has
come a mile out of it, in the wrong direction, and must retrace all his steps
to the New Road, and by following this line he will eventually arrive there.
He may stop a short time to inspect the theatre, a neat structure in the
farmyard-outhouse style of architecture, open in the autumn for the
amusement of the performers and orchestra.
The Rosherville Gardens appear originally to have been named the
“Kent Botanical and Zoological Gardens,” as we have learned from an
ancient inscription on one of the walls, well worthy the attention of the an-
| tiquary, but now half obliterated, and consequently more valuable. A bold
arch of whitewashed flints conducts the visitor to the terrace, from whence
a fine blow of the eye (to adapt a French phrase) is obtained of the entire
| range. At present the zoological curiosities are principally seen amongst
the visitors themselves, with the exception of three bears and some monkeys
(bonā ſide quadrupeds) who subsist chiefly on what they can get—more
*-i-j : 1 especially buns and gingerbread. There is a
large assemblage of British birds, principally
sparrows, who are not confined in aviaries,
but fly about as they like, occasionally thiev-
ing the food of the cockatoos on the lawn, in a
daring manner, without any fearof their beaks.
On extra days also a small collection of fowls may be seen, chiefly cold,
at the bar of the dancing-room, which is built after the model of the Crown-
and-Anchor, and under the superintendence of Mr. Baron Nathan, the cele-
brated hop-merchant, which, of course, in this locality, are chiefly Kentish.
There is a maze in these grounds, which will repay a visit. The secret
of arriving at the interior is to walk bang through the fences, when nobody
| is looking: this proceeding will be found to save much unnecessary trouble.
| The gardens are protected by a castellated battery on the heights above
, them, which, in the event of an insurrection, could command the entire
| enclosure, and throw shells (oyster or whelk) as far as the power of the
projector would admit. The whole place is at present in its infancy; but
it is the opinion of geologists, that centuries may elapse before the cliffs

surrounding it walk their chalks, or the hedges cut their sticks.
WINDMILL-Hill.—The ascent of this celebrated mountain, which is sup-
posed, and with some plausibility, to derive its name from the windmill on
the summit, is by no means dangerous, and may be performed in about ten
minutes from the inn at the foot, the excursion affording the curious para-
dox of going up a down. The downs near Gravesend must not be con-
founded with the Downs, all in which we are told the fleet was moored.
This was the case formerly, although the Fleet is now about to be moored
in the Queen's Bench—those who are there, however, are generally “all in
the downs.”
Several curious inscriptions on the houses arrest the eye during the
ascent, the majority of which, in the true spirit of mountain hospitality,
imply the willingness of the inhabitants to provide the traveller with tea and
shrimps for one shilling ; or the accommodating offer to those importing
their own tea, of water in a state of ebullition, and native porcelain, at two-
| pence per head. The only animals who can subsist here are donkeys, and
even these are obliged to be enveloped in a species of jacket, to guard
against the cold attendant on such an elevated situation. At the top
there is a portrait gallery of celebrated travellers who have reached the
summit, open to public inspection; and, on the extreme heights, an octa-
gonal building, termed the Observatory, appropriated to gastronomical pur-
poses. In the pastry-cook's shop we approach the regions of perpetual frost
—the glaciers of strawberry-ice never melt, on the hottest days in summer.
“The enraptured spectator," as the visitor is termed in the Guides, “may
now enjoy the view.” As he will evidently observe all the spots to be seen
from here, there is no need to mention them ; but we may state, amongst
the objects perfectly invisible from Windmill Hill, are—the “Punch” Office,
Pegwell Bay, and Putney Bridge. To the natural historian we may ob.
serve, that the principal à. found on the summit of this mountain appear
to be nut-shells, orange-peel, cherry-stones, gooseberry shucks, and empty
pottles. Adjoining are the
ARcheny GRounds, for the amusement of toxophilite gents, and the
young ladies they keep company
with. To the stranger it may
be necessary to remark, that,
during the shooting the safest
place to occupy is immedately
in front of the target.
The BAths at Gravesend offer
peculiar advantages, combining
the properties of both fresh and
salt water, with the impurities of
both, \\\\\
and the attributes of neither. Yellow slippers
may, however, be purchased in the town ;
and this circumstance probably induces the
belief that the neighbouring water is the sea
—a delusion which appears common amongst \
most of the settlers.

BRighton was an obscure fishing village till it was appropriately
patronised by the Prince of Wales, who, together with Mrs. Gunn,
converted it into a bathing-place. Now, however, it is one of the
most important sea-side resorts in England; for it contains quite as
many houses as are usually found in a moderately-sized town, and
—according as the weather is fair or foul—so fluctuating is popula-
tion, as to puzzle the calculating powers of the most acute census
Inumerator. -
The first object which naturally attracts the attention of the visitor
is THE RAILw AY TERMINUs, which consists of a noble shed, formed
by a sloping roof, tastefully overlaid with slates and supported by
iron pillars. The Booking-Offices are admirable specimens of the
brick-and-mortar style of architecture: the interior is conveniently
supplied with counters and clerks. Egress is obtained by means of a
large gate, which will be easily found on application to a policeman,
who will be recognised by his green uniform.
Arrived safely in Brighton, the stranger will naturally desire to
write home to his friends, for which purpose he had better sub-
scribe to—
THE LIBRARY, in North-street, where he will be able to get a sheet
of letter-paper by paying for it. This will naturally take him to—
THE Post-office, which is in the New Road, and presents a hand-
some frontage, consisting of a large window-frame tastefully va-
riegated with glass and boards. The hole for the epistle he will find
in the left-hand corner. Having performed this pious duty to his
absent friends, he may, with a clear conscience, seek out—
The pavilion,
An extensive pile, or rather (like the Shoreham Harbour) a series
of piles, originally intended as an imitation of Turkish architecture,
but, when finished, was found to bear so obstinate a resemblance
to a Chinese village, that its precise school has never been settled.
The furniture of the interior is splendid in the extreme, being chiefly
in the
ARABEsquE style,
magnificently gilt and carved. Some of the carvings are curious,
and record several visits made by the public when they were indis-
criminately admitted to view. “J. Griggs,” deeply cut with a clasp-
knife into a sycamore table, gives greater effect to its buhl-work;
whilst “Sarah and James,” boldly slashed upon a state chair, con-
siderably enhances its grandeur. This kind of work proceeded so
rapidly, that it was found expedient to suspend the free list; and
the only way in, at present, is through the Lord Chamberlain's
office. Attached to this Royal palace are—
THE Royal STABLEs, for the royal horses when recommended sea-
air by the Royal veterinary surgeons. Each stable opens upon an
equestrian circus, capped by a glass dome, admirably adapted for the
racing stud to take their heats in during the summer months, and to
take their colds in the winter season. The mangers and hay-racks
are French-polished, and were constructed, it is said, from designs by
the Prince Regent's upholsterer. The halters are supposed to con-
sist of the rejected articles manufactured for the palace bell-pulls;
the floors are tesselated ; and the hay is, we are told (but we cannot
vouch for the fact), kept in carpeted lofts and “pitched ” with silver
forks. A report got abroad during the reign of the illustrious builder,
that the stable-lanterns were lighted with wax candles, and that a
French cook was retained to prepare the soft mashes; but this was
contradicted from authority.

making the perambulation of these popular promenades is in the

of Calcutta. The sedentary visitor may start
from Kemp-Town and end his saunter at
Wick, with the proud consciousness of hav-
ing to walk only three hundred and thirty-
seven miles more, to complete a pedestrian
journey of the entire southern coast of Eng-
land.
THE CHAIN PIER, abutting from the Marine Parade, was con-
structed by Captain Brown, of the Royal Navy. This structure
stretches—“in linked sweetness long drawn out”—far into the sea,
and offers ample accommodation for a band of music which is some-
times stationed at the end of it, for a cutter-out of black profiles, a
dealer in ladies' shoes, and for a toy-seller, each of whose depositories
are situated in the iron towers that support the chains. It is also a
place of rendezvous for the inmates of boarding-houses, who, having
just separated from the dinner-table, encounter each other here with
many expressions of happiness at again meeting. Twice a week,
for about five minutes each time, the pier is really used for its
intended purpose—a steam-boat embarks or lands passengers for
Dieppe.
THE STEYNE contains several iron railings, and a statue of George
the Fourth.
THE GERMAN SPA boasts of a “meeting of the waters” much more
extensive than that in the far-famed Vale of Avoca, combining (as the
prospectus informs us) the properties of the Carlsbad, Ems, Marien-
bad, Auschowitz, Eger, Geilnau, Selters, Seidschütz, and Püllna Spas,
a concentration of excellences which is supposed to cure everything
but the stomach-ache.
THE Hotels of BRIGHTon are justly celebrated for the extreme
moderation of their charges, especially the principal ones, at which it
is actually possible to live as low as from ten to fifteen guineas per
diem; but then you must not indulge in warm baths, or be as
liberal as they think you ought to be to the waiters.
THE STREETs of BRIGHTon are, upon the whole, tolerably

DOVER.
DEscENDING the Thames to its mouth, Dover is situated on the
first turning to the right in the British Channel. Being the nearest
Place of cALL from abroad, it is daily occupied by hordes of foreigners
from all parts of the Con-
tinent; consisting chiefly of
> plaster-image boys, doubt-
is less attracted thither by the
immense quantities of chalk
which form the cliffs. The
stationary population consists of custom-house officers, touters,
hotel-keepers, boatmen, and shop-keepers; the latter subsisting
chiefly upon emigrants from London, who make the voyage on
Saturday nights to buy French shoes, snuff-boxes, &c., for the
purpose of fibbing their friends—when they return home on Monday
morning—that they have been on the Continent.
The principal attractions of Dover are Snargate-street (which is
quite as wide as Fetter-lane, but not nearly so straight), the Baths,
the Castle, and the Shakspeare Cliff. Bathing is preferred here, on
account of the clearness of the water, which allows the dippers to
see how deep it is before they make the desperate plunge.
The harbour of Dover is grand beyond description, having been
constructed at an immense outlay, for the accommodation of the
pilots, fishermen, and the two mail-boats which daily leave it for
Calais. The whole town is strongly fortified with a castle, redoubts,
and artillery, including “Queen Elizabeth's pocket-pistol;” a brass
cannon, and formidable engine of destruction, especially to whoever
might let it off, for there is no doubt that a charge of powder would
blow it to atoms. Some of the
ramparts are particularly impreg- XXX »
nable, having been constructed at = - |
an early period of history in chalk; -
but what renders Dover completely ¥l=
invincible is its governor;- the =º-
mere name of WELLINGTon is a ExFCutro in chalk
tower of strength, formidable enough to frighten away the most
hardy invader.
Dover is the place at which Julius Caesar first landed, and where
Napoleon Buonaparte didn't.
ROMNEY MARSH.
According to the best geographers, the world, properly divided,
consists of Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and Romney Marsh.
The last continues so obstinately a watering place, that although
whole ages and acts of parliament have been passed to drain it, it is
at present rather more damp than ever. Hence
it has been closen for the site of several of the
| Cinque Ports, which are also selected as bathing-
places by whoever chooses to go down to them.

HASTINGS.
THE town of Hastings—contained in the close embrace of an
amphitheatre of hills—bears in many respects a strong resemblance
to the circus of the late Mr. Ducrow. Instead of a stage, there is the
“stade” (or harbour), on which several nautical pieces are daily pro-
duced with great success; Hastings being the chief of the Cinque
Ports. Its scenery is grand beyond description, some of it having
-->
on E or the Sink Portts
been produced at a great expense; particularly St. Leonard's, and
the Marine Parade, which cost 1,000l. getting up ;-but the Fairlight
Down scene obtains most applause, spreading as it does over a vast
extent of country, including the “Lover's Seat,” and several noble-
men's dittos, the whole bounded—on a very clear day with a very
long telescope—by the coast of France. The properties are also
extensive in the vicinity of Hastings, and abound with modern
country-houses. -
Several pleasing excursions may be taken by means of flies, (so
called from the swiftness of their motion,) in which any number of
persons are drawn by
one horse. Though
there are by no means
war-chariots, yet they
will take you at a shil-
ling a-head to Battle,
a place eight miles off, -
where William the Conqueror beat Harold, and built an abbey.
Besides its claims as a watering-place derived from being close to
the sea, Hastings is intersected by a river called the Bourne, and
from it almost every traveller returns highly delighted with his visit.

Those who are so excessively genteel as to be very select in their

but once; and that was when two sheriffs' officers happened to meet
a friend of ours quite unexpectedly. Even he found the place too
retired, left it, and took refuge in an hotel near Fleet-street.

same time, and at the same price. The sands slope so gradually,

Tradition affirms that, in the middle ages, a play was performed in
the theatre; but its name, with those of the actors, have not been
handed down to posterity. Balls have—it is also asserted in the
Guide Books—been given at the Assembly-rooms of the Steyne
Hotel; but not a word is mentioned as to whether anybody attended
them. When Paganini gave a concert there, the waiters formed the
audience, together with two old gentlemen who went by mistake.
Worthing is particularly recommended to visitors for the pleasant
excursions to be made in its vicinity—to Arundel, Lancing, &c.; but
when these have been visited, most people go home again.
souTHAMPTON.
Even since the time of Henry the Fifth, Southampton has been a
celebrated watering-place; there he embarked for Agincourt, in
1415, though, now, most people go that way to Havre.
\
On entering the town the first object which the guide-books impe-
ratively call upon you to pull up at, is a high arch in the High-street,
upon the antiquity of which many learned disquisitions have been
written; and from them we gather that if it was not built by the
Ancient Britons, it very likely was constructed by the Romans,
although, when compared with other remains of Norman edifices, it
bears strong marks of having been raised by William the Conqueror;
whilst a statue of Queen Anne, recently removed from a niche in the
south front, to make way for a figure of George the Third, assigns to
this well-authenticated piece of antiquity a more modern origin.
Having thus cleared the obscure “Bargate,” you are conducted by
your convenient hand-book to the theatre A
at the other end of the town, which is Tº --

and no wonder, for “the performances ge- A handsome rrontage,
nerally commence early in the month of August, and continue until
the Christmas week;” so that if at Southampton a month is allowed
for the performance of each act of a tragedy, there can be no time
left for the farce.
It is a singular fact, according to our cicerone, that “baths at
fashionable watering-places are universally admitted one of the chief
objects of attraction,”* and the attractions offered by those of South-
ampton are said to be “elegance, convenience,”—and clean towels.
Entrance to the Royal Victoria New Pier is effected, by payment
of two-pence, between two handsome toll-houses (a penny for each).
It is also accessible to steam-boats, and—Southampton being very
select in its visitors—“gentlemen’s” yachts; but the price of ad-
mission for these is not stated.
The Spa is “attached ” to the Assembly Rooms, and the lovers of
carbonate of iron, and sulphate of magnesia, are said to be equally
attached to the Spa.
The natives of Southampton are noted for being exceedingly fond
of company, and violently averse to bribery at elections.
KNIGHTSBRIDGE AND LAMBETH.
The first Watering Place—in the literal acceptation of that very
wide term—which we come to on leaving London is at Knights-
bridge, where there is a capacious cab-stand,
and a place for watering the horses; but as it

a western direction from the great metropolis.
The town of Lambeth is not remarkable for anything but for its
burying-grounds, of which there are two, and its rag-shops, of which
there are nearly two hundred, all of them professing to give “the
highest prices” for bones and bottles. The chief commerce of the
place is in the hands of an enterprising set of marine-store dealers,
who are supposed to have come in with a body of settlers from the
Minories, when the overthrow of Ikey led to the discomfiture of the
house of Solomons.
But though Lambeth is insignificant as a mere town, it stands high
as a watering place; and the fact of its being the chosen residence of
the Archbishop will always give it a recherché air; while its being the
point at which all outward and homeward-bound steamers invariably
touch, must render it attractive to the casual visitor.
Among the chief amusements to be met with at Lambeth by those
who go there solely for pleasure, the favourite pastime is decidedly
• we quote “The Wisitor's Guide to the Watering Places.” London, 1841.
that of leaning on the iron railings of the grand parade—which runs
along the garden-wall of the palace—and watching the rising or
retreating of the tide—a process which takes place at certain hours,
which are always indicated in the newspapers. The Archbishop is
very fond of Lambeth, but does not mix with the inhabitants in that
sort of familiar intercourse that might be expected from a near
neighbour: but when it is remembered that there is a shop in the
general line precisely opposite his Grace's door, and the sign of the
“Sprightly Periwinkle,” is visible from the palace gate, we can
hardly blame the Archbishop for not selecting his society from his
own immediate vicinity.
Lambeth is considered healthy by all those who have faith in a
mixed atmosphere, compounded of effluvia from soap-boilers', smoke
from gas-works, and exhalations from a damp and muddy soil, which
is kept continually irrigated by copious overflows of the river.
The places of public amusement in Lambeth are by no means
numerous; but during the season, which begins on the 1st of January,
and terminates on the 31st of December, the place is often enlivened
by visits from travelling exhibitions, and the Mackintosh Untrustables
—a party of rivals to the Indian-rubber Incredibles—now and then
excite a sensation in the place by clearing a ring for a performance,
collecting a few preliminary pence, and walking away without going
through their truly unbelievable achievements—for unbelievable
they are, since no one has yet
seen anything more of them
than the adroit manoeuvre with a
two balls attached to a string,
which are employed in keeping
back the bystanders.
A group Arten. A distinguished ARTIST.
MILLBANK
Is a small and secluded place, on the northern bank of the Thames,
and is supposed to have been one day famous for a mill upon the
Bank, though the only vestige of anything of the kind now remain-
ing is the treadmill. The climate of Millbank is supposed to be
highly salubrious in a moral point of view, though very destructive
to mere animal life; and the Penitentiary, which is considered un-
rivalled as an hospital for the cure of the mind, proves, unfortunately,
extremely fatal to the body. The building alluded to is used to
save the expense of transporting convicts, who are kept at Millbank
for home consumption—and home consumption is frequently their
fate, for pulmonary attacks are frightfully prevalent.
There is a very handsome parade at Millbank,
but the laying down several cart-loads of gravel,
and other spirited devices adopted last year, have
not succeeded in investing the locality with the
character of a fashionable watering-place. Should
the cold-water cure come in general repute, there is
no doubt that the great advantage enjoyed by the
few inhabitants of Millbank in having the water
laid on as high as the ceiling of their kitchens, and
sometimes even to the depth of a foot on their ground
floors, will point out the spot as eligible to the fol-

VAUXHALL
Is situated in a fertile cranny or nook of land, and is approached
from the water by a pier which is almost twenty minutes' walk fur-
ther on than the place which the steamers profess to take you to.
But what is lost in time and trouble is perhaps made up in another
way, for you have an opportunity of seeing the Wind-

to a fine old ruin which looks like-nay, certainly 24

of which the whole of the top has either been stolen,

come down with their own carriages, particularly on Sundays, when
the juvenile branches enjoy the pleasures of the country.

The Royal Gardens are so well known, that it is hardly worth
while to notice them; but there are other places of amusement with
which our readers might not be quite so familiar. Among these are
the Brunswick and Victoria Gardens, which respectively open about
Whitsuntide with a strong company, including a gentleman who
sings “Hot Codlings” on his head; a feat which, according to the
bills, he has performed at the especial request of seven or eight
European potentates. There is also a Mr. Somebody from the “Nobili-
ty's Concerts,” and who is likely to remain as far as ever from the
concerts alluded to. The entertainments generally conclude with
the release of a little gunpowder from three or four rolls of cartridge-
paper, which is somewhat poetically described as a “Grand Display
of Fireworks.” And there is sometimes a monopolylogue by one of
the waiters, whose name is put into the bills for the occasion, and
who professes to give an entertainment à la Mathews; his qualifica-
tions for doing so consisting in a deal table, a couple of tallow
candles, and a white meckcloth.
BATTERSEA.
THE approach to Battersea is considered, in some degree, perilous;
for there is a strong current from the north-east; but a natural bay,
formed by the accumulation of several cart-loads of rich loamy mud,
gives a sort of security to the passage. There is a wild and lonely
tract on the coast, which has often proved perilous to the desperate
adventurers who come up in small boats from the East, and seek to
land on the northern embankments. The Red House is an object of
considerable interest to the traveller in these unfrequented parts;
and a rushlight is kept constantly burning in one of the top windows,
as a guide to the wandering bark of the weary mariner. The pier is
a rudely constructed erection; and a small hermitage, at one end of
it, serves as an abode to the Recluse of Battersea—an individual who,
in a sackcloth garment or blouse, devotes his days to the pious
martyrdom of waiting to give and receive the checks of passengers.
Of this individual little is known, except that he wears the monkish
slipper of Margate, and that his loins are girded with the leathern
belt of blackness. He passes the whole of his
days in mournful ejaculations of, “Anybody for
Milbank, Hungerford, or the City 1" and seldom
.N. varies the burden of his melancholy song unless
T it be to intersperse it with allusions to the Temple
and Westminster.
Battersea is not a watering-place where much gaiety prevails;
but the Fields are an object
of considerable interest to
amateurs in donkeys, where
a stud of three is constantly
kept saddled for the con-
venience of the metropolitan
visiter.
There are cottages in the neighbourhood, where tea is provided on
three-legged tables, out of doors, at 8d., a head, and the public, who
come for the sake of the rustic nature of the thing, have the satisfac-
tion of sitting on chairs without any bottoms, and otherwise revelling
in the luxury of really rural arrangements. The town of Battersea
would probably be a favourite resort, if any one could find it out;
but as there is no getting to it from the point at which the steamers
set one down, it is seldom or ever visited. It is governed by a beadle
and two turncocks, the latter of whom hold their offices during good
behaviour, under the County Fire-office. The beadle is removable at
the pleasure of the churchwarden upon an address from theinhabitants.

CHELSEA.
This important watering place is in latitude 00% from London
Bridge, and is chiefly famous for its buns and its Hospital. The buns
- were originally founded for the relief of
- hungry customers, but the Hospital was
established for the advantage of decayed
soldiers. Chelsea is built partly on a level
soil and partly on uneven ground, but the
place altogether has a very flat appearance.
It is more emphatically a watering-place
than any other in the vicinity, for the
Thames, which narrows to almost a creek
some miles higher up, expands in this part almost to the breadth of
a sea—and hence the name Chelsea, which was probably given by
the first settlers, who migrated with their families and effects from
the Brompton Border and the Fulham Frontiers.
oftigiNAL CHELSEA Bunhousk.
The town of Chelsea has lately been considerably beautified by a
simultaneous painting of shop fronts on the part of several of the
principal tradesmen; and the new pier, erected by the Earl of Cado-
gan, is an object of great curiosity to the traveller. It is a large
structure of stucco and deal, but we are unable to furnish any further
particulars. It was built under the superintendence of a master
bricklayer, whose name is already lost in the mist of months that
have elapsed since the erection of the building. There is a charity
school at Chelsea, the boys at which are supposed to have better
calves than those of any other similar establishment.
BATTERSEA BRIDGE.
THIs curious old pile is a singular specimen of the barbarism of
Gothic ages. It was built for the purpose of enabling persons to
go over it, and little regard has consequently been paid to the con-
venience of those who desire to go under it. It has the appearance
from the river of an old fortress, and is garrisoned by a single toll-
keeper.

WANDsworth can hardly be called a watering-place, for it lies in-
land; but the parochial boundary goes to the very verge of low-
water mark, and it is sometimes resorted to by the Metropolitan
visitor. A ditchy desert lies between the water and the town, so that
the inhabitants are protected from fears of invasion ; and we believe
that when William the Conqueror, at the head of his Norman legions,
surveyed his new kingdom, he was so struck with the secure position
of Wandsworth that he exclaimed “Nullum cot" (which, being in-
terpreted, means, “No go!”) to one of his followers. Wandsworth
has a commodious watch-house, which the munificence of a resident
has lately adorned with a weathercock. Its inhabitants are a rude
but somewhat romantic race, who are supposed to have great faith
in the interior resources of the place, and who therefore do nothing
to attract the foreigner to their isolated neighbourhood.
P U T N E Y.
Putney is supposed by an old classical writer to be the ancient
Patnos—founded by a few colonists from Pat-nos-ter, or Paternoster
Row ; but, as there is no evidence to confirm the ingenious hypo-
thesis of the old classic, we at once reject it as contemptible. It is
quite true that the old Greeks refer to Patnos as an isle of great
beauty; but as Putney is neither an island nor particularly beautiful,
we can see no reason why the two places should have been thought
to be at all identical. It is more likely that the word
Putney, if it has any origin at all, arises from a prac-
tice, still prevalent among the people, of playing at
the game of Put, and the addition of the syllable Ney -
may be very easily accounted for. portpr’s ANTIquiries.
The principal attraction of Putney is the High-street, which is
exceedingly short, and is chiefly admired on this account, as it
enables one to get out of the place with as little delay as possible.
Few people land at Putney, and fewer still are tempted to remain
there after having landed. The bridge is an object of some cu-
dºs riosity, for people wonder how

A beautiful instance of the triumph of obstinacy over interest,

lay down their money for the purpose of erecting it. The bridge
itself, like the value of the shares, is at a very low pitch, and a
vessel passing under it is compelled to lower her chimney on to the
heads, or into the laps of her passengers, besides rendering it in-

BARNES.
Though there is no maritime intercourse between the metropolis
and Barnes, it is impossible to pass over without notice the modest
little knot of brick erections which constitute the place we have
mentioned. Barnes is to be regarded as a little curiosity, for as
there is no regular conveyance to it by water, and such thing as a
stage-coach going to Barnes was never heard of, it is really a matter
of considerable mystery how any one has ever found his way to it.
From the number of houses that are to let, it is, however, very
clear that people are glad to find their way out of it. Barnes is sup-
posed to have been founded by the celebrated Pantaloon of that
name, which accounts for the clownishness of some
of the inhabitants. This is, however, merely an
antiquarian surmise, and like nearly all antiquarian
*** surmises, is one of the greatest pieces of tomfoolery
A. that can be well imagined.
Rural hamlet.
ISLEWORTH
Is a small and compact borough, which sends two omnibuses to
town, but no members to Parliament. It is a great deal resorted to
in the fishing season by those who had rather not catch any fish, but
who have no objection to stand for several hours on the banks of the
river, holding a fishing-rod. Its natural productions are potatoes
and tittle-bats—the last of which are brought from the river-side
in pocket-handkerchiefs, in very small quantities, by boys, who suc-
ceed in catching them with a worm attached to a pin, and fastened
to a few yards of packthread. An irregular group of islands stud
the bosom of the river on leaving Isleworth, and are supposed to be
chiefly inhabited by the swans, who enjoy the patronage of the Lord
Mayor and Aldermen. His lordship, as conservator of the Thames,
occasionally goes up the river, for the purpose of inspecting the nests
and counting the eggs; and it is said that he claims all the pears
growing in the gardens on the banks, if they happen to be swan's-
eggs. We have been given to understand that strict orders are left
with the Lord Mayor's Deputy, that if a, , ,
swan with two necks should make its |
appearance in any part of the river, the |
bird shall be immediately placed under | | -
arrest, and brought to the Mansion- | |

GREENWICH.
The Observatory at Greenwich, originally built by John Flam-
stead, for watching the rise of the celestial bodies,
is now principally used at fair-time for observ-
ing the fall of the terrestrial ones, in their declin-
ation down the Hill. The diverting game of
Fixing the Meridian is played there daily by the
professors. The sport consists in pulling a round
ball to the top of a high pole, and then letting
it fall, to indicate the hour of noon, which less
educated people ascertain by looking at a clock.
During the fair, also, the astronomers find full
employment in watching the apogee and perigee
taken in Tow.

Both Greenwich and Blackwall are celebrated for whitebait—a
delicate fish, remarkable for its intoxicating properties, to judge from
the deportment of those who have partaken freely of it. The white-
bait come up with the tide, and are apt to go down with cold punch.
During the height of the season, the traveller will do well to inspect
the steam sawmills, used for the purpose of cutting the brown bread-
and-butter eaten with these fish. We do not exactly know their
situation, but leave it to be found out upon inquiry.
The Naval Gallery of Greenwich Hospital is adorned with paintings
of great sea fights; and fills the mind of the spectator
with admiration at the coolness of the artist who could
sketch the contest in the midst of such awful carnage.
In the Council Chamber we find, according to the cata-
logue, “No. 122. King James, after Sir Peter Lely;”
the latter individual is, however, not introduced ; and
the portrait of the king does not betoken much energy
in the chase. There is also an astrolabe, presented by
Queen Bess to her duck Drake. No. 56 in the catalogue
HArt Mi.ess Man represents “Admiral Sir H. Palliser, after A. Dance.”
- He does not, however, seem to have exerted himself
much.
In the centre of the Hospital Square is a statue of George II., in
the appropriate costume of a Roman Emperor, for the purpose of
showing future ages how the English kings dressed at this period.
On the ceiling of the Painted Hall,
are allegorical representations of the
rivers of England. According to the
account of Sir Richard Steele, prefixed
to the catalogue, we see “the river
Tyne pouring out sacks of coals; the
Humber with his pigs of lead, and
rivers tumbling down, by the moon's
influence, into the Severn. The whole
raises in the spectator the most lively images of glory and victory,
and cannot be beheld without much passion and emotion.”

BROADSTAIRS
Is about three miles from Margate, and seems to be a shrine to
which certain fashionable people make a yearly pilgrimage, in order
to do penance. It is said by some historians to have been a Roman
station, but there is no doubt that it was originally colonized by
genteei emigrants from Margate, who were driven hither by the
migratory hordes from Tooley Street. - - -
its principal attractions consist of a black wooden pier with white
rails, and a solitary pony.
At the foot of the pier is a large-sized packing-case, bearing the
imposing inscription of Droit Office; but as no record exists of such
an establishment ever being required at Broadstairs, we presume
that it has been erected to be ready in case of necessity.
A flint arch, which Sir John Henniker
was kind enough to repair in 1795, is face-
tiously designated by the inhabitants as
York Gate, and is said to have been origin-
ally erected for the defence of the place;
but as nobody ever thought it worthy the
trouble of an attack, the gates were used
in 1800 to repair the stairs from which the
town derives its name.
Turning your back upon this ancient
defence, you cannot fail of being struck by
the Royal arms, which occupy the entire
front of a confectioner's shop in honour (as
we were informed, from a first-floor window,
by a gentleman in a striped nightcap) of “her gracious Majesty
having, sixteen years ago, purchased her first lollipop at this manu-
factory.”
Near this place, we are informed by old Kelburn, in his Survey of

MY DEAR Boy, You tell me you have been reading Captain Cook's
Voyages, and are so much pleased with them, that you would start
round the world on a voyage of discovery to-morrow morning.
You will seriously offend me by any repetition of this folly. Leave
such mad adventures to fools and zealots. Stay you and make
greater discoveries at home.
Do you know the reward of these simpletons who peril life, and
forego all the comforts of the fleshly man—for what To give, it may

for his pains. Who can point out the two yards of dust that cover

The world is quite large enough for you ; let fools, if they will,
leave their snug arm-chairs, and sea-coal fires, to extend its bounda-

Have you not the pleasant banks of Thames, the tens of thousands of
unsophisticated natives thronging its shores; all of them ready to
exchange their gold-dust for any glass-beads you may bring for
barter, if, by your confidence and swagger, you can pass off the glass
for veritable diamonds ! If you can, great and sufficient will be your
reward. If you cannot, you will undergo the rightful penalty of your
ignorance. But the thing is done every day. Do not imagine that
they are the only savages, whose skins are soot-colour, who wear
rings through their noses, stick parrots' feathers in their woolly
hair, and bow to Mumbo Jumbo as their only deity. My dear boy,
you will find amongst the whitest, the most carefully-dressed, and
most pious of London—absolute children of nature—men, as it would
seem, expressly made for the support of their fellow-creatures, as
shoals of herrings are every season spawned expressly for the nutri-
ment of whales. Therefore, trust yourself to no canoe on the Senegal,
but prosper on the banks of your paternal river. -
You would like to be a discoverer Very well. London is a
boundless region for the exercise of the greatest sagacity. Leave to
dreamers the solution of the shortest cut to India—find you the
north-west passage to the pockets of your fellow creatures. Discover
the weaknesses of men; they will be to you more than the mines of
Potosi-bring you richer merchandize than cargoes of gold-dust
and ivory.
If, forgetful of my paternal lessons and unworthy of your pro-
genitor, you address yourself solely to what is absurdly termed
the dignity of human nature and the amelioration of the condition of
mankind, if you choose to make one of the fools who have lost their
labour and their soap in the vain attempt to wash the negro white,_
why, starvation, obloquy, and wretchedness in every shape attend
you ! Your heart's blood may dry up in a garret, and—if your car-
case be not arrested by the bailiff—you may rot in the pauper's
corner of the parish churchyard. To be sure, after some hundred
years or so, it may be some comfort for your ghost to slip from your
forgotten grave, and make midnight visits to the statue that may be
at length erected to the genius that died, the debtor of a twopenny
loaf to a benevolent baker. If you will be contented with such re-
ward, try of course to elevate your species. If, however, you would
rather enjoy present sixpences, why then spin pewter plates on a
balanced sword, or poise a donkey. My dear boy, work for ready
money. Take no bill upon posterity : in the first place, there
are many chances against its being paid ; and in the next, if it be
duly honoured, the cash may be laid out on some piece of bronze or
marble of not the slightest value to the original. Sure I am that no
statue or monument is erected to the memory of one who is at length
called the benefactor of his race, that the ceremony is not a holiday
for famine and all the household furies. They behold in the thing an
irresistible temptation to other fools. One rewarded martyr inevit-
ably raises a new regiment to bleed and suffer.
It is upon this truth—for truth is not always to be disregarded—
that I would have you stand : it is upon this principle I would have
you eschew all romantic notions of travels to Abyssinia, and voyages
to the Pole, for the more profitable discovery of the weaknesses of
mankind. Are you fond of wild countries, curious plants, rare
animals, strange adventures Plunge into the heart of man. There
you will find deserts, poisonous weeds, snakes, and a host of iniquities
arrayed against a host.
You will also find streams gushing with
health, amaranthine flowers, cooing doves, and things of divine aspect
and heavenly utterance: with these, however, meddle not. No ; turn
from them, and, spite of yourself, convince yourself that they exist
not—that they were the mere phantasm of the brain—the mere
offspring of the imagination, that, sickened with arid, burning tracts,
sees in its sweet disease palms and silver streams, and in the tinkling
of the camel's bell hears the heart-delighting nightingale. Not so
with the dreary places and the venomous things. Learn every nook of
these ; catalogue every object. It is in such spots you are to drive a
prosperous trade; it is such articles you are to use in barter. Does
not the wise tradesman put on his comeliest looks and bow lowest to
his best customer ? Virtue is a poor, paltry creature, buying her
miserable penn'orths at miserable chandlers'. Now Vice, Weakness,
and Co., are large, burly traders, and “come smug upon the mart.”
Therefore, make yourself master of their tempers—find your way to
their hearts; for they have hearts—even as blocks of marble some-
times contain within them the sleeping, sweating toad, “ ugly and
venomous.”
However, in opening an account with this firm, be sure you never
apply to them the names spat upon them by clean-mouthed Virtue.
Oh, no although you know them to be leprous to the bones, you
must treat them, must speak of them, as though they were the in-
carnation of health; though their corrupt practices are to the nostril
like the foulness of a new battle-field, you must snuff them as though
you inhaled the odours of myrrh and frankincense burning in the
temple.
When you have become a scholar in the weaknesses of the human
heart, you may then lay them under what impost you will. You may
—but I will tell you a little story in illustration of the truth of this:—
You must know that the greater number of the inhabitants of
Ceylon have it, as their firm belief, that when dead their souls will
take up their habitation in the bodies of various animals. A wise fel-
low—too wise to work, and sage enough to be determined to enjoy
himself without labour—turned the superstition of his neighbours to
constant profit. Whenever his pockets were empty he would rush
into the streets, and carrying a live duck in one hand, and brandishing
a knife with the other, he would exclaim to the terrified people-
“Wretches I this duck may be your grandfather—yourgrandmother
—your father—your mother—your brother—your sister—your son-
your daughter Wretches I'll kill the duck!
Whereupon, men, women, and children would throw themselves
upon their knees, and offering what money they had, beg of the man
not to kill their grandfather, their grandmother, their son, their
daughter, but in the depths of his mercy, and for the sake of ready
money, to touch not a feather of the duck! -
And the man, pocketing the cash, would walk away, for that time.
My son, you are not an inhabitant of Ceylon; but a denizen of en-
lightened London; nevertheless, in every city every man has some
sort of a “grandmother” in some sort of a “duck.” ,

ISS TICKLETOBY'S LECTURES ON
ENGLISH HISTORY.
M
LECTURE III.--THE SEA-KINGS IN ENGLAND.
N the olden time our glorious
country of England, my dears,
must have been a pleasant
place; for see what numbers
of people have taken a fancy
to it ! First came the Ro-
mans, as we have seen, then
the Saxons,—and when they
were comfortably established
here, the Danes, under their
Sea-kings, camegallantly over
: the main, and were not a
whit less charmed with the
island than the Saxons and
Romans had been.
Amongst these distinguish-
ed foreigners may be men-
- tioned the Sea-king Swayn,
who came to England in the year nine hundred and something,
landing at Margate, with which he was so pleased as to determine
to stop there altogether, being, as he said, so much attached
to this country that nothing would induce him to go back to
his own. Wasn't it a compliment to us? There is a great deal
of this gallantry in the people of the North; and you may have
observed, even in our own days, that some of them, 'specially Scotch-
men, when once landed here, are mighty unwilling to go home again.
Well, King Swayn's stay became preposterously long; and his
people consumed such a power of drink and victuals, that at length
our late beloved monarch, King Ethelred the Second, was induced
to send to him. A bard of those days has recorded, with considerable
minuteness, the particulars of Swayn's arrival; and as his work has
not been noticed by Turner, Hallam, Hume, or any other English
historian, may be quoted with advantage here. Snoro the Bard (so
called from the exciting effect which his poem produced on his
audience) thus picturesquely introduces us to the two Kings:—
* AETHLFRED KONING MURNING POST REDINGE.”
B. M. Miss, claud. xxv-xxvii.
A reading of the newspaper in meditation lost,
Sate AEthelfred of England I and took his tea and toast;
Sate AEthelfred of England I and read the Morning Post.
Among the new arrivals | the Journal did contain,
At Margate on the twentieth | His Majesty King Swayn,
Of Denmark with a retinue | of horseman and of Dane!
Loud laugh’d King Æthelfred, I and laid the paper down ;
Margate is a proper place for a Danish clown.
Take care, said the Chancellor, I he doesn't come to town.
This King Swayn, says Witfrid the fool, I laughing loud and free,
Sea-king as he is a boat-swain ought to be.
It is none of our seeking, I says the Chancellor, says he.
Let him come said the King (in his mouth butter'd toast popping),
At Wapping or at Redriff I this boatswain will be stopping.
Take care, says Chancellor Wigfrid I he don't give you a wapping.
I'm certain, says wise Wigfrid, | the Sea-king means us evilly,
Herald, go to Margate I and speak unto him civilly;
And if he's not at Margate, why then try Ramsgate and Tivoli.
Herald, in obedience to his master dear,
Goes by steam to Margate, landing at the Pier;
Says he, King Swayn of Denmark | I think is lodging here?
Swayn the bold Sea-king, I with his captains and skippers,
Walk'd on the sea-beach | looking at the dippers—
Walk'd on the sea-beach I in his yellow slippers.
The ballad, which is important to the archaeologian, as showing
how many of the usages of the present day prevailed nine hundred
years back (thus fondly do Englishmen adhere to their customs!), and
which shows that some of the jokes called puns at present currently
uttered as novelties were in existence at this early period of time,
goes on to describe, with a minuteness that amounts almost to
tediousness, the interview between Swayn and the herald; it is
angry, for the latter conveys to the Danish monarch the strongest
exhortations, on the part of King Ethelred, to quit the kingdom.
Nay, I cannot go, said Swayn, I for my ships are leaking.
You shall have a fleet, says the herald, if that be what you're seeking.
Well, I won't go, and that's flat, I answered Swayn the Sea-king.
Falling into a fury, Swayn then abuses the King of England in the
most contumelious terms; says that he will make his back into a
foot-ball, and employ his nose for a bell-rope; but finally recollecting
himself, dismisses the herald with a present of five-eighths of a groat
—twopence-halfpenny (a handsome largesse, considering the value of
money in those days), bidding him at the same time order what he
liked to drink at the hotel where he (King Swayn) resided.
“Well,” says the Chronicler pathetically, “well might he order
what he thought proper. King Swayn of Denmark merer paid a
copper.” A frightful picture of the insolence and rapacity of the
invader and his crew 1
A battle, as is natural, ensues; the invader is victorious—Ethelred
flies to France, and the venerable Chancellor Wigfrid is put to the
most dreadful tortures, being made by the ferocious despot to un-
dergo the indignities which (as we have seen in the former passage)
he had promised to inflict on the royal fugitive, as well as many
more. As a specimen of the barbarian's ingenuity, it may be stated
that the martyr Wigfrid is made to administer a mockery of justice,
seated on a woolsack stuffed with—the mind revolts at the thought
—stuffed with fleas 1
But it is remarkable that the bard Snoro, who so long as Swayn
was not victorious over Ethelred is liberal in his abuse of the Dane,
immediately on Ethelred's defeat changes his note, and praises with
all his might the new sovereign. At Swayn's death he is lost in
grief—being, however, consoled in the next stanza by the succession
of his son Canute to the throne.
Snoro gives particular accounts of Canute's reign and actions—his
victories in foreign lands, and the great drawn battle between him
and Edmund Ironsides, about whose claims the bard is evidently
puzzled to speak; however, on Edmund's death, which took place,
singularly and conveniently enough, about a month after Canute and
he had made a compromise regarding the crown (the compromise
left the kingdom to the survivor), Snoro takes up the strain loudly and
decidedly in favour of Canute, and hints at the same time his perfect
conviction that Ironsides is roasting in a certain place.
And then, after following King Canute through his battles—in one
of which the celebrated Godwin (who, I believe, afterwards married
Mary Wolstonecraft) showed the valour of Englishmen—aftergoing
through a list of murders, treasons, usurpations, which the great
monarch committed, the bard comes to that famous passage in his
history, which all little boys know ; and I have the pleasure to show
a copy of an Anglo-Saxon drawing which is to be found in the MS.,
and which merer has been seen until the present day.
This drawing was handed round to the company by Miss Tickle-
toby, and excited an immense sensation, which having subsided, the
lecturer proceeded to read from the same MS., Claud. XXVII,
XXVIII., “The Song of King Canute.”
King Canute was weary-hearted, he had reigned for years a score;
Battling, struggling, pushing, fighting, killing much, and robbing more ;
And he thought upon his actions walking by the wild sea-shore.
'Twixt the Chancellor and Bishop walk'd the King with step sedate;
Chamberlains and Grooms came after, Silver-sticks and Gold-sticks great;
Chaplains, Aides-de-Camp, and Pages, all the officers of state.
Sliding after like his shadow, I pausing when he chose to pause,
If a frown his face contracted straight the courtiers dropp'd their jaws;
If to laughter he was minded out they burst in loud hee-haws.
But that day a something vex'd him that was clear to old and young ;
Thrice his Grace had yawn'd at table when his favourite gleeman sung–
Once the Queen would have consoled him | and he bid her hold her tongue.
“Something ails my royal master,” I cried the Keeper of the Seal ;
“Sure, my Lord, it is the lampreys | served at dinner, or the veal:
Shall I call your Grace's doctor?" | “Psha, it is not that I feel.
“'Tis the heart and not the stomach, fool! that doth my rest impair;
Can a king be great as I am | prithee, and yet know no care 2
Oh! I'm sick, and tired, and weary.” | Some one cried, “The King's arm-chair!"
Then towards the lackeys turning, | quick my Lord the Keeper nodded;
Straight the king's great chair was brought him | by two footmen able-bodied;
Languidly he sunk into it, it was comfortably wadded.
“Leading on my fierce companions,” I cried he, “over storm and brine,
I have fought and I have conquer'd: where is glory like to mine?”
Loudly all the courtiers echoed, “Where is glory like to thine !”
* The poems are translated, word for word, from the Anglo-Saxon, by the ac-
complished Adolphus Simcox, Esq., anthor of “Perdition,” “The Ghoul,” editor
of the “Lady's Lute,” &c.

“What avail me all my kingdoms? | I am weary now and old;
Those fair sons I have begotten | long to see me dead and cold ;
Would I were, and quiet buried underneath the silent mould.
“Oh, remorse the writhing serpent at my bosom tears and bites;
Horrid, horrid things I look on I though I put out all the lights,
Ghosts of ghastly recollections troop about my bed of nights.
“Cities burning, convents blazing | red with sacrilegious fires;
Mothers weeping, virgins screaming | vainly to their slaughtered sires.”—
“Such a tender conscience,” cries the Bishop, “every one admires.
“But for such unpleasant by-gones | cease, my gracious Lord, to search;
They’re forgotten and forgiven | by our holy mother church.
Never, never doth she leave her I benefactors in the lurch.
“Look, the land is crown'd with ministers | whom your Grace's bounty raised;
Abbeys fill'd with holy men, where | you and Heaven are daily praised;—
You, my Lord, to think of dying ! I on my honour I’m amazed.”
“Nay, I feel,” replied King Canute, “that my end is drawing near.”
“Don’t say so," exclaimed the courtiers | (striving each to squeeze a tear);
“Sure your Grace is strong and lusty and will live this fifty year!”
“Live these fifty years l’’ the Bishop | roar'd (with action made to suit);
“Are you mad, my good Lord Keeper | thus to speak of King Canute?
Men have lived a thousand years, and I sure his Majesty will do.'t.
“Adam, Enoch, Lamech, Canan, |Mahaleel, Methusela,
Lived nine hundred years apiece ; and is not he as good as they ‘’’
“Fervently,” exclaimed the Keeper, “fervently I trust he may.”
“He to die?” resumed the Bishop; “he, a mortal like to us?
Death was not for him intended, I though communis omnibus.
Keeper, you are irreligious for to talk and cavil thus.
“With his wondrous skill in healing ne'er a doctor can compete ;
Loathsome lepers, if he touch them, I start up clean upon their feet;
Surely he could raise the dead up | did his Highness think it meet.
“Did not once the Jewish Captain stop the sun upon the hill,
And, the while he slew the foeman, bid the silver moon stand still P
So, no doubt, could gracious Canute if it were his sacred will.
“Might I stay the sun above us, good Sir Bishop,” Canute cried,
“Could I bid the silver moon to pause upon her heavenly ride 2
If the moon obeys my orders, sure I can command the tide.
~~
“Will the advancing waves obey me, | Bishop, if I make the sign º’’
Said the Bishop, howing lowly, “Land and sea, my Lord, are thine.”
Canute look'd toward the ocean, “Back,” he said, “thou foaming brine !
“From the sacred shore I stand on, I command thee to retreat,
Venture not, thou stormy rebel, | to approach thy master's seat;
Ocean, be thou still, I bid thee, I come not nearer to my feet.”
But the angry ocean answered with a louder, deeper roar,
And the rapid waves drew nearer | falling sounding on the shore,
Back the keeper and the Bishop | back the King and courtiers bore.
And he sternly bade them never | more to kneel to human clay,
But alone to praise and worship that which earth and seas obey;
And his golden crown of empire I never wore he from that day.
King Canute is dead and gone; Parasites exist alway.
THE NEW FOOL-OMETER.
The measure of folly invented by the Reverend Sidney Smith—St.
Paul's mirth-exploding cannon-residentiary—hath at last, after various
improvements, been brought to perfection by those experienced jesters,
Commodore Napier and Joseph Hume. Up to Friday evening, July 29,
the following indications were placed against the various degrees on the
scale to prove a man to be a fool:—
Any secretary of state for the colonies, or otherwise, who receiveth
deputations from Canada, and so implicitly believeth their statements of
imaginary grievances and trumped-up wrongs that he proceedeth to con-
coct and issue orders in council, which set the whole country in open
rebellion.
Any man who believeth that the Whigs are better conjurors than Herr
Döbler.
Any man who incontinently becometh the manager of a playhouse.
Any person who can read and subscribeth not to “Punch.”
Any reader of the “Morning Herald " who trusteth in the daily lauda-
tions of George Robins, and believeth him to be the greatest auctioneer
upon earth.
Any elector who doth promise to vote for a parliamentary candidate
without first ascertaining how much cash he hath lodged at the local bank.
But these and an uncountable number of softheads—varieties of the
same species—may be not always and altogether fools, but only foolish
upon the particular points above-named. The fool positive and the fool
superlative are thus pleasantly described by themselves in the debate of
Friday, July 29:-
Sir C. Napier accused Mr. Hume of moving for nonsensical returns,
some of which he had himself seconded : whereupon—
“Mr. Hume said the gallant officer talked of his moving for nonsensical
returns: if they were nonsensical ones they were foolish ones, and, ergo,
he was a fool. (Loud laughter). But was not the man who supported a
fool as great a fool as the fool himself? (Laughter.) And yet the gallant
commodore had supported him in five motions to obtain these very returns
which he now called nonsensical returns, but without which he told him
that he should never be able to show the state of the navy.
“Sir C. Napier said he had supported the hon. gentleman merely $9
show him that he was wrong.”
vyse's spelling-hook, with cuts.
Any man, therefore, who talketh nonsense is a fool positive.
But who is to prove him a fool superlative The “rum old commo-
dore,” by agreeing with him.—Q. E. D.
THE FIRE-ESCAPE SOCIETY.
This well-meaning Association has published its report, from which we
learn the gratifying fact, that it has succeeded in saving one life; during
the several years that the society has now been in existence. , Dealing
with this life upon the usual principle of calculations followed at Assurance
Offices, we find that it stands, in the relation of one to a hundred and
eight; and we are, therefore, justified in stating, that any life which is
under the especial protection of the society alluded to, is worth, on an
average, about three weeks' purchase.
While a point is very properly made of the one life, saved, we hear
nothing of those which have been lost; and the case of the Society's man
who rattled down from the height of a hundred feet in a bucket to show
the way in which it worked—when he was unfortunately dashed to atoms
on the spot—is not alluded to. Perhaps, however, on the principle of the
Railway Companies, who, when a person is killed, consider that inquiry
is satisfactorily stopped by the announcement that it is “only a stoker,”
the Protection-of-life-against-fire Society feels that it may do as it likes
with its own, and that it is not accountable for any casualties among its
own servants. We are surprised that the Society has not taken credit in
its report for the number of people who are saved by being drawn up
and down for the amusement of the crowd on the day after a fire.
We ourselves witnessed some delightful experiments with boys
a little while ago, who were pitched out of top windows with rope:
round their waist to a degree that really rendered their being “saved”
a matter little short of miraculous. One or two added to the
interest of the scene by rebounding to within an inch of the wall of the
house, and then executing a series of rapid gyrations while their booted
feet were almost on a level with the heads of the admiring bystanders. The
Society has, however, our best wishes, and when the apparatus can be got
to a fire while it is raging, instead of .# only on the next day—when
the bucket has learnt moderation and will pause before it reaches the
pavement—when the ropes are ready at the right time instead of being
absent or in a knot whenever they are wanted—when all this occurs,
Punch's guinea may be called for by the Collector of the Society, on pre-
senting this number as his authority, at the Office, in Wellington Street.

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON IDLER.
CHAPTF. R VI.-CONCERNING THE GENT.
Fall the loungers who cross our
way in the public thoroughfares,
the Gent is the most unbearable,
principally from an assumption
of style about him—afutileaping
of superiority that inspires us
with feelings of mingled con-
tempt and amusement, when we
contemplate his ridiculous pre-
tensions to be considered “the
thing.”
Were we inclined to dismiss
the subject of our chapter in a
few words, but, at the same time,
anxious to give our readers the
best general idea of him, we
should say that the finest speci-
mens of the Gent might be seen
pourtrayed in the coloured
“Fashions” with which certain
tailors adorn their windows. In
these pictorial representations
of presumed style, some favourite
West-end locality is taken for
the back ground, and in front are
many Gents, in such attitudes
as may display their figures and
littleboots to the best advantage.
Some are presumed to be ar-
layed for an evening party in
green dress-coats and puce
tights; some again are represented as sportsmen, with pinched-in
waists that the shock of the first leap, or kick of the first fire, would
knock in half; and others are promenade Gents in frock-coats and
corded trousers, bowing to one another with much grace, or leading
little Gents by the hand, who look like animated Daguerréotypes of
themselves.
A grade lower are the representations of men ofton, who figure at the
side of cheap tailors' advertisements; and at the bottom of the scale
stand the dummies we sometimes see displayed at the doors of ready
made clothes shops, invested in the splendour of an entire suit
“made to measure for the same terms.” The announcements peculiar
to the Frankensteins of these strange creations are both imaginative
and full of spirit; we write one of them, and present the copyright
to any of them who may choose to adopt it :-
THE ATTEMPT ON THE QUEEN'S LIFE.
A wild excitement reigns throughout the town,
Policemen scour the city up and down,
And try throughout the day to capture Bean,
Who snapp'd the pistol at our lovely Queen.
Each guileless hunchback falls a ready prey,
And to the station-house is hauled away.
But had their garments been by Stitchtapes made,
To show their forms they had not been afraid.
Mark their drab Chesterfields of the first water,
With the first rain "twill shrink four inches shorter.
One pound's the price—it surely can't be dear,
And warranted to wear for half the year.
The celebrated window-cleaning blouse,
To buy at six-and-six you can't refuse.
Their new dress-coat they make for one pound nine,
And at this price of course 'tis superfine.
With contract suits they build for eager nobs,
In the most dashing style of Sunday snobs.
Coarse cloth, rude work, bad cutting, and quick wear,
With Stitchtapes' grand depot what can compare 2
And recollect—old suits must be return'd,
If when worn out they're not worth being burn'd.
Then haste to Stitchtapes’, and inspect their store,
For going once, you will return no more".
Such is the ubiquity of the Gent, and under so many phases does
he move, that it is next to impossible to place him in any regular
* Not ten days back, since this chapter was written, we were disgusted at per-
ceiving a puffing advertisement of the class above alluded to, in which the melancholy
death of the Duke of Orleans was made the medium of attracting the eye of the
reader to the trumpery doggrel which followed.
classification. However, evening is approaching, (the time when
Gents and cheap umbrellas chiefly flourish), and we will therefore
sally forth and jot down the peculiarities of such specimens as we
may encounter, for the instruction of our friends.
We have stumbled over one the minute we have quitted the house.
This species is possibly a clerk, who is scribbling in an old coat all
day at his office, and now puts on a cheap Taglioni, or one of the
“Gent's new horsecloth envelopes,” dons a cheap pair of gloves, sticks
a cheap cigar in his mouth, and imagines that he is “rather the Stil-
ton than otherwise”—“Stilton,” or “cheese" being terms by which
Gents imply style or fashion. He is pursuing a pretty girl, of modest
deportment, who is possibly going home after her hard day's toil at
the bonnet-shop.
The Gent has not the sense to perceive that his advances are
repulsed with scorn and indignation. He imagines, that by addressing
his coarse and annoying attempts at gallantry to an unprotected girl,
he is acting as if he was “upon town”—“a fast man”—“up to a thing
or two”—“a roué”—or some other such epithet ; which it is the am-
bition of the Gent to get attached to his name.
There are a group of thorough-bred Gents (be careful, reader, not
to confound them with thorough-bred gentlemen), whom we see
through the window, lounging in a tobacco-shop—some leaning
against the counter, others seated on tubs, and occupying the like
positions. This employment is another variety of what Gents think
knowing.
The presiding goddess of this temple of smoke is an uneducated
woman, who has been more or less pretty at some time or another;
but still retaining sufficient attraction, it would seem, to draw the
Gents about her. Here they will pass hours, finding intense plea-
sure in her common-place, uninteresting conversation—retailing dull
jokes, worn-out anecdotes, or vapid inevitable puns to each other;
and staring at any casual purchaser who may enter the shop, as if he
were an intruder on their domain.

These are the Gents who are afterwards seen in the theatres at half-
price: in the slips during the performance, and in the saloon during
the entr'acte—the class, who, whilst they carry on brisk conversation and
smart repartees (of a sort,) with the least reputable in public life, form
the vapid nonentities of private society when females are present.
They are men, to use a phrase more expressive than elegant, strongly
addicted to bear parties—who think “a glass of grog and a cigar” the
acme of social enjoyment, and who look upon all entertainments as
bores that throw them into the society of ladies, or, indeed, any one
of intellect or refinement.
The toilet appertaining to Gents has few variations. They like
fierce stocks, out-of-the-way cravats, large-pattern handkerchiefs,
staring trousers, and the like articles. They think it grand to sit on
the box of a coach, and are hurt if they cannot do so. They would
imagine they lost caste if they did not know something about the
horses and odds of an approaching race. They affect thick sticks and
queer superfluous pockets and buttons to their great-coats; and they
regard the various night haunts of London with the same affectionate
feeling that Alciphron evinced towards the gardens of Athens—with
the exception that the young Epicurean was certainly not a Gent.
At the theatres it has sometimes occurred that the Gents have been
observed in private boxes, and when this is the case, they are perpe-
tually pulling the curtains backwards and forwards, (because they
have seen the élite shroud themselves behind their folds occasionally,)
and exhibiting their hand only. During the play they assume a
négliyé attitude, which is meant to be imposing and aristocratic. When
it is over they immediately migrate to a neighbouring tavern for some
singing and supper; and here, perhaps, we may pitch upon the Sport-
ing Gent—an individual in a cut-away coat, through the sleeves of
which are thrust two ungloved beefy hands, who, if he cannot get
into conversation upon dogs and horses, is as silent as a pickled
salmon. The true Gent slaps Von Joel on the back, shakes hands
with the chairman, and knows the comic singer. All this is, how-
ever, harmless in its way, for the majority of these houses are ex-
ceedingly well conducted; and, indeed, it is only the Gents of the
lowest sphere who deem it spirited to mix themselves up, in other

THE NATURAL HISTORY OF COURTSHIP.
CHAPTER V.—OF MEN who ARE Most LY REJ Ect ED.
With men who move in much society, making love is a habit.
They may be divided into two classes—consisting of men who are
generally rejected, and men who are frequently accepted.
You may know the man who has been often rejected, by his set-
ting up for un homme à bonnes fortunes—by his eternal boastings of
success. He is, in most instances, dandified in his dress, and pos-
sesses a talkative, know-every-thing, manner. He makes a point of
paying great devotion to the sex; and where men and women meet,
is always to be found boring the latter, happily indulging the former
with little of his company. On entering a room, he seeks out the
belle of the party, and “makes up" to her with the least possible
delay. His mind—being constructed upon the principle of a barrel-
organ, which can only play a certain number of tunes—furnishes him
with a prescribed number of topics, a limited range of compli-
ments; and not being an economist of either, his stock of subjects
is soon exhausted, and he is obliged, during his incessant chatter, to
work them up over again. The belle, flattered—by what she knows
must appear to her female friends a new conquest—smiles, encou-
rages his loquacity, dances with him twice, and refuses to waltz with
her latest admirer. This temporary favour is mistaken by the vanity
of the favoured for a deeper feeling. He meets the lady two or
three times more—without much regard to delicacy—proposes, and
is, of course—rejected.
The clever, amusing fellows, who may be called the mountebanks
of society, form another set, who are seldom mucla favoured by the
sex. They have not time to pay any single beauty even that
degree of attention which is conventional, being always so busy in
angling after applause of themselves. These are the singers of songs,
the givers of imitations. Watch such a person at a soirée whilst téte-
à-tête with a belle, be she even worthy of the truest devotion. He
talks mechanically, he responds to her remarks at random ; for if
you notice his eyes, you will remark that they are following the
motions of the hostess, whom he devoutly prays is about to ask him to
sing. If she do not make the longed-for request, he immediately
turns the conversation with his companion to the performances of the
more favoured singer, picking them to pieces, and saying how he
would “do” such and such passages had he been asked. When the
delightful moment does arrive, and he is in the glories of a comic song,
he throws glances between every verse to the lady he deems he is so
highly favouring by his notice, which plainly asks her whether he is
not casting the rival who sung last quite into the shade 1 and when he
has finished his task, and the applauso and laughter are over, he puts
the same query in words, adding, “How do you like my song?”
Should the damsel declare “she is delighted with it,” he implicitly
believes her. Perhaps her mama or her chaperon asks him to her
next party, just as she would hire Rubini or Herr Döbler;-to amuse
her guests. The “clever young man,” mistaking the daughter's
complimentary delight for a sentinent, and her mama's invitation for
approval thereof, takes an early opportunity of proposing, and is
most unequivocally rejected.

Besides these, there are many other sorts and conditions of men
who are regularly rejected, including—paradoxical as it may appear—
those who are eventually accepted ; for young ladies believe them-
selves bound to dissent from the first proposition, especially if made
prematurely. It is not till after much perseverance, and the third
time of asking, that the most sanguine man ought to begin to hope.
Such as we have more particularly described are doomed to die
bachelors, for they are so closely wedded to their own personal
perfections that no maiden will marry them.
—
THE MINISTERS AND THE DEPUTATIONS.
TheRE was a meeting of delegates last week on the subject of the general
decay of trade, and they at once repaired to Downing-street, where they
were admitted to an interview with all the Ministers.
Mr. Jinkins, of the New Cut, opened the proceedings by stating the
lamentable falling off in the baked tatur business. Nearly all the cans in
his district were entirely stopped, and those that were at work could
hardly find a market for their produce.
Sir R. Peel asked what became of the raw material, of which so much
was consumed ! -
Mr. Jinkins replied, that the material was sold in its raw state to a
higher class of persons than those who formerly took off the baked article.
steam. He had himself passed down the New Cut, and counted twenty
cans all going at once, and as each was surrounded by a crowd of boys,
the glut was of course dreadful.
Mr. Jinkins said that must have been on Saturday night. But, how-
ever, he would go to another branch of trade—he meant the cheap cherry-
business. It was true that the ha'porths fastened on pieces of stick were
generally taken off; but when the profit of the grower and the market:
ardener, to say nothing of that of the timber-merchant, was deducted
#. the halfpenny, he would ask what was left for the retailer to support
himself, a wife, and eight or nine children.
Sir R. Peel :—I thought that the tariff, in lowering the timber-duties,
would have given a buoyancy to the cheap cherry-trade.
Mr. Jinkins:—Ay, but the growers get the benefit of all that. Then
there are the hemp-producers, who have to be paid for twine, and when
ou take off one-ninety-ninth of one-half per cent for this, you reduce still
i. the profit that the seller must get out of the halfpenny before he can
take anything home to his family.
ALL A-Gruowing.
Sir R. Peel :—That is very true, but if the hemp now coming up in the
southern parts of the country turns out well, which I am given to under-
stand is extremely probable, may we not look for increased buoyancy in
that department, which may be advantageous not only to the cheap cherry
interest, but to the small timber growers —Mr. Jinkins said it might be
so, but until the growers had got all they wanted, it was impossible for the
sellers to get anything.
Mr. Pitts begged to say a few words on behalf of the marble trade,
which he had carried on for several years in the Seven Dials. The new
tariff would let in real marble at such a low figure that he must at once go
to Pots if he wished to continue his business.
Sir R. Peel asked how that can be
Mr. Pitts:—Why Sir, if the importers can send an Alley into the market
lower than I can turn it out of my warehouse, the only chance I have is to
place all my hands upon common Pots—or turn off the two men that I have
hitherto been employing.
Sir R. Peel allowed there was some truth in this, but he must look for
better times, and trust to pot-luck.
Mr. Pitts said that was all very well, but if Sir R. Peel could come in
and take pot-luck with some persons in his (Mr. Pitts's) trade, he, Sir R.
Peel, would not be so ready to make a joke about it.
Sir R. Peel did not mean to joke—indeed he was never more serious.
He had himself in earlier days taken much interest in the marble business,
and the name of Pitts was associated with some of the most pleasing spots
in his (Sir R. Peel's) memory. But he could not help saying, and indeed
he would say, that though marbles might be for a moment down it was
their natural tendency to rise up again. He thanked the gentlemen
present for the information they had given him, and politely bowed them
out of the room.
THE HUNCHBACK OF NEWGATE.
THE fiend, miscreant, monster, Beam, has sadly vulgarized treason.
His thimble-full of powder and broken 'bacco-pipe have killed all
the importance of the petty traitor, who is henceforth not to barº,
his neck for the rope, but his back for the whip. Henceforth,
the Royal Arms, will, to the eyes of all future Beans, appear we
subjoined:—
From this time the Arms of England admit of a new supporter;
in addition to the Li d Uni the Cat 1 i soit qui
Sir James Graham attributed the falling off to the introduction of ition to the Lion and Unicorn they take the Cat Honi soit qui
mal y pense may henceforth be freely translated by the Beans and
Francises, as follows:–
“A rod is in pickle,
Your toby to tickle.”
The traitor sinks from the hero of the scaffold to the vagabond of
the cart's-tail. He is levelled down to an apple-stealer; and his hopes
of “a provision for life” terminates with the application of whip-cord.
This is a wise measure; it is smiting the evil, that generates traitor-
fools, at the proper end.
Whilst Sir Robert Peel had his hand in Treasonous Acts, we
would he had struck out the mockery that condemns the traitor to
the hurdle, with the supplementary punishment of having his head
cut off, and his carcase cut into quarters and distributed according
to the “pleasure of her Majesty.” When sentence of death was
passed upon Francis, the solemnity of the judgment was lessened by
what everybody felt to be a fiction. Allowing, for a moment, that
: Francis had been hanged, does any man believe that in these times
the traitor's quarters would have decorated Temple Bar, or York
Gates? Imagine our gentle Queen transmitting a quarter of Francis
to a corporation, to be hung up as a terror to all nascent traitors |
Consider, for an instant, the effect of the fool's-head grinning on the
Tower wall. As we have done with the reality of these horrors,
why keep up their fiction : Why make Imagination see, about the
black cap of the Judge, the winking eye of the Zany When the
Judge pronounces “Death” upon the traitor, we are struck by the
awfulness of the doom; but when he talks of “quartering,” we
feel we listen to nothing more than the “tol de rol” of a worn-out
song.
THE ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY.
It having been rumoured that a stone had been dug up near Battle-
Bridge, the Antiquarian Society sent for the precious fragment, and a
Committee was at once appointed to sit upon it.
After having sat for some time, the Committee reported that the sub-
stance was very hard, and having moved the standing order, asked leave
not to sit again, which was at once granted. The letters L E G were
found to be distinctly visible. This, it was observed, had been supposed
to allude to some legions who came in with Caesar, and who are supposed
to have made for Gray's Inn Lane with a precipitancy that the miserable
nature of the neighbourhood renders rather unrecountable. The Chair-
man thought that LEG, instead of meaning legiºns, might more naturally
be thought to stand for LEG, and thus we might come to the fact that
Gray's Inn Lane was the first place that Caesar put his foot or leg upon.
(Hear, hear.) That a battle had been fought there, no one could doubt;
for the quantity of old-iron shops in the neighbourhood bear testimony to
the large amount of javelins that must have been expended—sup:
º the iron which is daily brought for sale to have formed part of
them.
After several hours' further discussion, it was resolved to place the
stone in the hands of a skilful macadamiser, with the view of examining
it more in detail than it would be possible to do in its entire state ; and
follow, the meeting was adjourned.

THE NEW BRIBERY BILL.
HE measure proposed by Buller (not Bul-
ler of Brazennose) having been weighed
and found wanting, Roebuck—whose ances-
tors did not leave him sufficient capital to
avail himself of the privilege of bribing to
any extent—has taken the matter so much
to heart, that being always his own porter,
he brought us, in his own arms, the volu-
minous report of the “Compromises at
Elections' Committee,” requesting advice
and an interview. “Punch,” with that
* suavity and condescension for which he is
famous, was immediately accessible. The conference lasted exactly twelve
minutes, and from it resulted the following draught of a bill, together with
several of half-and-half which the terror of “treaters” (at elections)
very handsomely stood.
&Hi}creag, the preamble recites that ever since the passing of the Act
of William IV., intituled “An Act to amend the Representation of England
and Wales,” it hath been a common practice for candidates, who set them-
selves up to represent the honest and independent constituencies of this
kingdom, to debauch the said honest and independent constituencies by
the bargain and sale of votes, and by divers other expedients contrary to
the statute aforesaid in that case made and provided.
Qſì) crefurc, by Clause I., it is enacted, that any candidate who shall
present unto any person whatsoever five thousand pounds or more, with-
out knowing how the said sum or sums is, or are, to be distributed or ex-
pended, shall be considered an egregious ass within the meaning of the
act, and unfit to represent any enlightened and incorruptible body of elec-
tors who shall exceed in number one hundred and eighty.
CLAUSE II.-Provides that no elector who, walking in procession, car-
ries a flag or other emblem, shall receive more than six pounds sterling
per day—always providing that the opposition candidate do not offer him
seven pounds per diem and his victuals, in which case it shall be lawful
for the aforesaid flag-bearer to do as he likes.
CLAUSE III.-And be it enacted, that any candidate who shall make or
cause to be made any immaculate elector drunk on or after the day of
election, shall, on conviction, pay the usual fine as if he were drunk himself;
notwithstanding and nevertheless that, contrarywise, he shall have been
sober.
CLAUSE IV.—Declares, that any individual who shall take instructions
from and canvass for a candidate, or shall receive sums of money from
the same, for the purpose of “expenses,” distribution as head-money,
paying electors' rates and taxes before registration-day, or otherwise, or
making speeches in praise, and giving dinners at the sole expense, of the
same, or (in undeviating conformity to an Act intituled “The Ribbon
Act,”) distributing coloured favours, with new hats appended thereto,
shall, on no pretence whatsoever, be considered as, or denominated an
“ agent.”
3. W.—Makes the stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds a sale-
able office, the price to be regulated by the election expenses of the can-
didate applying therefor".

THE WHARNCLIFFE EAR-PLUG.
LoRD WHARNcliffs begs to inform cabinet ministers, poor-law guardians,
and others, who are subject to the importunities of distressed manufac.
turers, hungry paupers, or poor relations, that he has become the pro-
prietor of an ear-plug which can be so arranged as to allow the wearer to
hear or understand only as much as he pleases. This important invention
owes its origin to an infant three months old, the ear-plug having been
originally constructed to exclude those distressing infantine sounds which
mothers usually attribute to teething or the wind.
Lord Wharncliffe, from a pure feeling of Parliamentary Philanthropy,
intends to offer this desirable instrument at the lowest possible price, and
begs to subjoin the following unimpeachable testimonial of its efficacy.
“My Lord, I hereby certify that when the deputation from the dis-
tressed manufacturers waited upon your Lordship, I am fully convinced
that you would not hear the statements of distress then made to you, and
the following report, extracted from the Times, is perfectly correct:—
“After listening to a few brief representations of distress, Lord Wharn-
cliffe said, he must be excused from further details, and politely bowed

“THE EYES OF EUROPE.”
Who has not heard of the Eyes of Europe? “The Eyes of Europe
are upon us!” “We shall become contemptible in the Eyes of
Europe P’ “What a proud position shall we hold in the Eyes of
Europe!” “The Eyes of Europe are at length opened " |
These are familiar cries; so familiar, that we are almost insensible
of the important truths they proclaim : hence, a man thinks no more
of the Eyes of Europe being upon him, than if they were the multi-
tudinous yet unreproving eyes in the tail of a peacock. He goes
upon his daily business; he eats, he drinks, he sleeps, now drives
his little bargain on the Stock Exchange,_and now, in the solitude
of a well-bolted attic, sweats her Majesty's sovereigns, wholly care-
less of the fact that all the time the Eyes of Europe are goggling at
him on the mart, and through the casement. Why is this The
reason is obvious. The man has never seen the Eyes of Europe :
they are to him inexpressive as the eyes of needles. We hasten,
with the magic aid of art, to show to the unconscious culprit what
it is to have only some of the Eyes of Europe wide awake upon him.
Of course, the Eyes of Europe are as susceptible of varied expres-
sion as the eyes of Venus. They do not keep one continual doll-
like stare, but smile, and frown, and scowl, and squint, and now
have insolent, “high-exacting looks,” and now droop as hang-dog
and as sheepish as Hodge taken in the fact with stolen mutton.
It is not our intention to delineate all the Eyes of Europe as at
present staring at one another. We do not propose to give the com-
placent, grateful glance of Belgium smirking at France—the haughty,
watchful orbs of Spain—the tyrant scowl of Russia—the contented
bigotry of Portugal—the cat-like looks of Austria—the calculating
coldness of Holland, and every other European glance, but shall
confine ourselves to our own Eyes, and the Eyes of our opposite
neighbour.
Behold our artist bids all the other Eyes of Europe bend their
orbs upon
THE EYEs of ENGLAND.
There is, it will be observed, a melancholy, a heaviness in the Eyes
of Mr. Bull at the present moment, that tell of the Income Tax,
of the Corn Laws, of the rags and hunger of tens cf thousands of his
children: They have a downward anxious look, as though John was
rummaging a hand in his capacious pocket, and knowing not whether
it was a half-sovereign or only a fourpenny-piece that just struck his
knuckles, and which he is endeavouring to pull from the abyss, that
he may make up his quarter's taxes. There is considerable gloom
in the look of Bull; nevertheless, it cannot be said of him—
“There is no speculation in those eyes;”
for John is still ready to do business with anybody; and you can see,
despite of a troublous spirit in his looks, that it is not a settled, a
constitutional heaviness, but that he can pluck himself up, and,
brushing the back of his hand across his eyes, whistle, “Begone, duli
Care ſ” and, “Britannia rules the waves.”—However, we now ieave

What sublimity of insolence is in their expression What a
cannibal look 1 They are scarcely human eyes, but have a wicked,
Afrite gleam, that speaks of the man-eater. You would swear that
the owner of the Eyes hungered for meals of nothing but human
flesh cured by battle-smoke—seasoned with gunpowder. You feel
that the Eyes would sparkle at a goblet of blood, tossing it off like
eau sucrée. Blood—blood—blood—from the streaming veins of civi-
lization; such is the daily beverage the Eyes hunger for . Such is the
drink the owner of the Eyes would pour down his ogre-throat; and then,
drunk with the abomination, shout, scream, and roar, “Glory—glory—
glory ! !” Nor is there unmixed ferocity in the Eyes. Look at them.
Do you not detect a sneaking, cut-purse expression ? Is there not

Such are the benevolent, the philanthropic Eyes of Young France!
Fortunately, Trading France has eyes too. Consider them.
You perceive that he is counting the sous in his hand; and puzzling
his brains how he shall add five centimes to the valuable copper ex-
posed in his palm. He has all the stupidity of covetousness. Trading
France knows that dozens of his sons in the South cannot get cus-
tomers for their wine; he, however, tells them they must keep their
bottles in the cellars, for he has at least two children in the North,
who have a spinning-jenny each, and who, with such mighty mechanic
power, may, if properly encouraged, in the year 3000 supply cotton
twist to all Picardy. You can perceive that, pacific as are the eyes
of Trading France, there is nevertheless in them a certain expres-
sion that shows their paternity to the Eyes above. Calculating France
has no objection whatever to the shoutings and fanfaronnades of
Young France: they sound of glory, la grande nation, and all that ;
but when it comes to a serious question of cutting English throats,
why, then the commercial gentleman, with all his eyes, counts all his
—sous !
The Eyes of England, when raised towards France, look more in
sorrow than in anger at the Eyes of their opposite neighbour.
Consider yourself in the centre of the Channel, with an excellent
telescope. Now, look towards Dover Cliffs, and now towards the
Heights of Calais. What have you beheld Why, -

GRAND REVIEW OF THE POLICE IN TOWER
STREET.
It having been rumoured by a boy in a pinafore, who whispered it
into the ear of a lad in velveteen, that the police were coming out of the
station in Tower-street, the neighbourhood became a scene of much bustle
and activity. It soon got about that a review was to take place, and hav-
ing despatched our own reporter to the spot, we are enabled to give the
following particulars. - - -
At about a quarter to eight, the sergeant of the J. division, followed by
eight of the men, came upon the ground in front of the station, and the
review was at once proceeded with. The first manoeuvre was the beau-
Long division-
tiful exploit of falling in, which was executed in a manner that would
have put the regular troops to the blush, and suffused the cheeks of the
oldest grenadier with the deepest crimson. The sergeant, who was on
foot during the whole of the review, marched round the whole line of
men, poking in the stomachs of the more corpulent with the end of his
staff, so as to bring them as nearly flush with each other as possible.
The following words of command were then given :—
1st—"Shoulder capes”—which means “cape shoulders.” This beau-
tiful manoeuvre is thus accomplished. It consists of three motions: at
the first the men draw their capes out and unroll them; at the next they
give them a shake ; and at the last they throw them over their shoulders.
2nd.—“Present lanthorns.”
men were turned full upon the two eyes of their superior officer.
After a few more manoeuvres, the word was given to wheel and take
close order, when the whole force got on to each other's heels with sin-
gular dexterity. In this state they marched off to their respective beats,
and the Inspector having gone through the manoeuvre (as practised by
Buonaparte) of taking a pinch of snuff, retired into the station-house.
The review occupied the greater portion of five minutes, and was at-
tended chiefly by the younger branches of some very private families
in the neighbourhood.

shell had been thrown into the town, which on inquiry turned out to be
an oyster-shell. The Chelsea consul had been called upon to interfere,
and had obstinately refused; but there were hopes of an arrangement,
through the intervention of the British resident at Battersea. Our
advices from Twickenham speak of an outbreak among the population,
which was soon put down by the native apothecary. |
The treaty by which Epsom is allowed to import its salts into Epping
free of duty, in exchange for the sausages of the latter, is at last signed,
and has occasioned a ferment in Banbury, whose cakes are now subjected
to a very heavy duty. The Bath envoy claims the advantages of the
tariff for Bath buns, and the inhabitants of Windsor have sent commis-
sioners, to provide for the introduction of Windsor soap upon just
principles.
The Mayor of Everton had an interview with Sir Robert Peel, on the
subject of toffey ; and the Archbishop of York has presented a petition
in the name of the biscuit-makers, many of whom are so reduced as to
devour their work in the paste, before it is put into the oven. The Mayor
of Brighton has been with Sir James Graham, on the subject of Brighton
rock; but it seems that they had no sooner got on the rock question than
they split upon it.

Upon whose upper lip a small well-turn'd moustache may grow,
With soft dark eyes, and waving hair, which o'er his brow may flow.
Wanted wanted by a young coquette,
A belle of the present season.
She undertakes to find him tics, and gloves, both white and yellow,
If he'll make himself agreeable—be, in fact, “a useful fellow; ”
At the Opera adjust her glass—her fragrant bouquet hold,
At féte or ball run for her shawl, if she fears to catch a cold.
Wanted 1 dreadfully wanted
By a flirt of the present season.
It is desirable he write a soft and pleasing letter;
If poetry he can indite, and waltz well, all the better.
A smattering of music, too, is almost indispensable—
For ignorance of notes is, at this time, most reprehensible.
Wanted terribly wanted
By a flirt of the present season.
To Kensington or Chiswick—to the Regent's Park or “Surrey"—
He must fly off upon command, yet ne'er seem in a hurry.
Morn, noon, and night be at her beck,-do everything—in short,
To play the part of a fiancé, but—only just in sport.
Wanted sadly wanted
By a flirt of the present season.
He must be a foil to other men, and keep them all at bay,
Until the season's over, and the beau monde flown away;
And then she'll quit “the flaunting town,” and “the busy hum of nen,"
And give him a “long vacation ” till the gay world wakes again.
Wanted exceedingly wanted 1
By a belle of the present time.

THE CASS00N FOR “THE LIGHT OF ALL NATIONS.”
The latest dates (but one) from the Cassoon were of the most cheering
description, and notified the fact that “all were doing well;” but the
latest dates of all are of a very alarming character. It appears that the
Cassoon retired to its bed—of sand—over night in its usual health; when,
probably from being too much puffed up at the success that was at last in
view; the unhappy machine burst and blew up late on Saturday. We
should be sorry to say anything harsh of the defunct. As the “light of
all nations” is completely out, we presume that the whole world will be
wrapped in gloom for the next fortnight. After the melancholy event
that has happened, there will be no occasion to accept our liberal offer of
an extinguisher, made elsewhere.

THE GAMUT AND THE DRAMA.
Music has charmed the ministerial breast. Lord W HARNcliff.E ad-
vocates “Tweedle-dum” in the Lords; whilst in the Commons, Sir Ro-
BERT PEEL appears for “Tweedle-dee.” The singing classes at Exeter-
Hall have made themselves heard by the Cabinet, and the gamut as a

liament by the prime minister. Do we quarrel with this By no means.
Do we find fault with Sir Robert PEEL for his late personal attendance at
Exeter-Hall to hear with his own ears the musical strains of the working-
classes : Oh, no : though we could wish he had listened more attentively
to the terrible music issuing from the cellars of Leeds and Manchester, and
let down the corn-laws a peg or two lower in unison with the screams
for bread.
But, we ask—when will the prime minister appear in the stage-box of
our various theatres : When will he, with an anxiety corresponding
to the care he evinces for music, turn his attention to the drama If
Mr. Hull AH be worth attention, why should not Mr. ShakspeaRE
If music for the people be so fine a moral pabulum, is a drama for the

SONGS OF THE SEEDY.—No. XIX.
Oh, why withdraw thy gentle hand,
And bid me to release it?
Aha! thy cuff " I understand—
By heaven I will not crease it.
I'd rather tear my heart from thee,
Though with thee cvery hope was tangled.
Take back thy hand—thy cuff is free—
Yes, like my feelings, nicely mangled.
You give me back thy hand, aha
Alas! I can't despise it.
No, by the moon that shines afur,
Too much, cold girl, I prize it.
This pressure shall declare my love,
Sweet hand ' why from me shouldst thou wean it P
That blush ' I see, you thought the glove
Smelt of the stuff they use to clean it.
No matter, dearest, though thy dress
Were damaged, turn'd, and dyed;
I still would all my love confess,
And take thee for my bride.
Though thou wert even doom'd to wear
Cheap habit-shirts at one-and-nine,
Or shoes at two-and-six the pair,
Though secdy, thou shouldst still be mine.
THE LATE THUNDER-STORM.
A Most singular accident occurred during the storm of Thursday. A
n was sitting in a public-house, when the fluid passed from the cellar
ow to the beer above, and having entered a pewter pot, was conducted
down his throat; and the phenomenon having been repeated several times,
the individual became at last completely prostrate. An uninterrupted
succession of “flashes of lightning,” conducted through the medium of an
ordinary gin-glass, were seen to pass rapidly into the mouth of a party,
upon whom the fluid soon began to take a wonderful effect, causing him
to stagger from side to side, and ultimately, throwing him with some
violence into a gutter.
A curious incident occurred in a crowd : the finger of an individual
suddenly became light, and was conducted with electrical velocity into
another person's pocket, when being attracted by the metal, it struck upon
the whole of it, and then glided off, so that the bolt which usually follows
was quite in another direction.
--
THE PHARISEES' SUNDAY.
MR. PLUMPTRE and some others of his holy party have, for some days
past, taken to their beds, horror-stricken by the late motion of Mr. HUME,
the object of which was—the further desecration of the English Sunday.
Here is the excellent, the camphorated PLUMPTRE, assisted by a godly
few, endeavouring to give the sleepers of the railways a sound nap on the
Sabbath—to stop the pistons of the steam-boats on the seventh day—to
prevent the unrighteous milking of cows, and suckling of parish children
on the Sunday ! Here is the disciple of AGNew striving, with all his
righteous might, to make the day of rest a day of tribulation, and to
invest the profane holiday-maker with orthodox sack-cloth and ashes,
when the infidel member for Montrose steps forth, and proposes—that the
British Museum, the National Gallery, and other public buildings, be
opened for the recreation of unbelief on the Sabbath! Yes: making a
distinct proposal that the false gods of Egypt should be visible on Sun-
days—that the voluptuous iniquities of TitiaN and Poussin, should be
made public on the seventh day !
This motion is, however, very properly met by the argument—so
K. and so humane—that to open the British Museum and the
ational Gallery on the Sunday, would be to add a day's labour to the
people employed there. Of course it would be impossible to have a dis-
tinct body of Sunday door-keepers and attendants; there being, espe-
cially in these times of national prosperity, no unemployed hands. For
this reason tens of thousands are, on a fine aristocratic principle, sacri-
ficed to some small fifty.
One honorable member, however, with a fine knowledge of the human
heart, observed, that as in these days the working-man was frequently in
want of employment, he might very well devote his unoccupied time to the
contemplation of antiquities and works of art in lieu of making them a
Sabbath recreation. There is not the slightest doubt that when a man
knows not where to get a dinner for his wife and family, he is in the best
possible temperament to receive the influences of antiquity and highest
art. If he want bread-and-cheese, he is doubtless in the best possible
mood to contemplate an Egyptian mummy; if his wife and young ones
need a breakfast, it is but to delay their usual hour for the meal, and then
to take them to feed off the fruit-pieces in the National Galiery.
fear, in the end, the spirit that dictated it will prevail. The Museum
and the Gallery are, for the present, closed on Sundays : so for a time
there are left for the people—the Eagle Tavern and the Red-House at
: Battersea. -
HUME’S TOUCH OF HUMOUR
MR. HuME made a speech in the House the other night, which never
was surpassed for its energetic truthfulness. “I am a fool,” said the
Honourable Member for Montrose, and applauding “Hears” confirmed
the accuracy of his statement. It is said that we are generally the last
to know ourselves, but it is refreshing to find Mr. Hume coming ulti-
mately to that happy state of enlightenment which has made, at length,
clear to him a fact that has been all along palpable to others.
Mr. Hume having happily given up his meddling with large numbers,
has at length come down to that very simple figure, Number One, and
we are glad to find him so accurate in dealing with it. The Honourable
Member sits for Montrose, and when we remember it is the scene of the
Children of the Mist, we at once perceive the affinity between the fog-
giness of the place, and the brains of its representative.
Gnand MAMA seems to have been sadly flustered by the thunderstorm last week.
Her report of the damage, in the Herald of Friday last, shows how completely her
brains must have been addled, as the following extracts tend to prove :-
“The wainscoat has a charred appearance, showing the action of the clementa!
re” (!
Ji -- M. and Mrs. Chenu slept in the first floor, who had been also alarmed, and who
had got up.”
“The beautiful spire of St. Martin's Church received such injury as to render it
unsafe to perform divine service until it has undergone repair."
• Elemental fire . " we presume to be the Herald for lightning ; but how a first floor
can get up frightened, and a spire perform divine service, we are at a loss, with all
our acumen, to make out.
There is a house in the City whose accounts are so confused, that hearing the clown
at Batty's Circus can balance anything, they have sent for him to see if he can balance
their books, which have defied all their efforts.

PUNCH*S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
Letter iV.—on The Choice OF A PROFESSION.
My DEAR CHILD,-You say, you are anxious to select for yourself
an agreeable and profitable profession, and solicit my paternal coun-
sel to assist you in your choice. This brings to my recollection, that
your darling mother onee begged that I would accompany her to a
mercer's, to choose a gown. We entered the shop, and desired an
inspection of the warehouseman's commodities. Velvets—cut, flowered
and plain; satins of all colours; sarsnets; silks, shot with thunder
and lightning, muslins, poplins, bombazeens, pompadours—all the
beautiful products of the loom were graciously taken from the
shelves, and displayed upon the counter before us. Some two or
three hours were agreeably passed in this way; when your dear
mother, with one of her sweetest smiles, thanked the shopmen for
their trouble, then said, “she thought she could only afford a ten-
penny gingham.”
My dear boy, I fear it will be thus with you in your choice of a
profession. I may, it is true, unroll an archbishop's lawn before you—
may call your earnest attention to a Lord Chancellor's ermine,—may
request you to feel the weighty bullion of a commander-in-chief's
epaulets, to weigh in your hand the gold-headed cane of a court
physician—and when all this is done, you may call for the leather
apron of a cobler, or the goose and needle of a tailor.
I wish—and heaven witness my aspiration—that in your birth the
law of primogeniture had bound you apprentice to £15,000 per annum,
besides my good-will, when I slept beneath a slab of marble: such
a calling must be a very pretty business, and believe me, I should
have mightily liked to be your master. As fortune has ordered it
otherwise, let us look at the professions.
Will you enter the church 4–Alas! what a prospect lies before
you. Can you discipline your mind and body to fulfil the functions
of your office? I will at once suppose you a bishop. Can you, I ask
it, satisfy your appetite with merely locusts and wild honey? Will
you be content with raiment of sack-cloth, or at the best, linsey-
wolsey; and can you answer for your conscience that you will, at all
times and in all weathers, be ready to make a pilgrimage to the
hovels of the poor; to give comfort to the wretched; to pray beside
the straw of the repentant guilty; to show, by your own contempt of
the creature blessings of this world, that you look upon the earth as
a mere temporary tarrying-place,—a caravanserai where you are
awaiting until called beyond the clouds? Consider it; as a bishop,
you will be expected to take your seat in the House of Lords. When
there, shall you be prepared, with the rest of your brethren, to set a
continual pattern of piety and self-denial to the lay-nobles? Will you
be ever prompt—as bishops always are—to plead the cause of the
wretched; to stand between the sinking poor and the arrogant rich;
and with a voice of almost divine thunder wake in the callous hearts of
worldlings, a slumbering conscience for their fellow-men Will you
be in the House of Lords, a lump of episcopal camphor, a bundle of
spikemard—a pot of honey? Can you—as all bishops always do—
abstain from the lusts of Mammon, and keep your lawn, white and
candid as the wings of angels, from the yellow soil of filthy Plutus?
Thinking only of the broadest, the shortest, and the best way to
heaven, will you (like all bishops) never meddle with turnpike-acts,
nor job with wooden pavements? Eschewing the vanity of coach
and footman (as John the Baptist did, and all bishops do) will you
think only of the carriage of Elisha; and turning from the pomps
and vanities of an episcopal palace, can you (as all bishops do) feed
humbly, lodge lowly, hungering only for immortal manna, waiting
only to be called to that home—
“Whose glory is the light of setting suns.”
My dear boy, examine yourself and say are you equal to all this?
I think you are my own flesh and blood, and thinking so, doubt your
constancy in this matter. Hence, I would advise you to eschew the
church ; for unless you could lead a life apostolical, as all bishops
always do, what disgrace would you bring upon the bench—what a
slander and a bye-word would you be in the mouths of the heathen
Let us now consider the law, and suppose you called to the bar.
—Have you the fortune to support your dignity—have you, for this is
more, that gentleness of spirit, that philanthropy of soul, which would
make all men brothers, which would pluck from the hearts of your
fellow-creatures, malice and dissent, the foul hemlock and nightshade
that poison the sweet sources of human love? Consider the change
that has come upon the law and its guileless professors. There was,
indeed, a golden time, when you might have amassed a fortune by
playing bo-peep with Truth; by abusing, reviling her; by showing
her virgin innocence to be strumpet infamy; by plucking every
pinion from her sky-cleaving wing, and making her a wretch of sordid
earth; by causing Truth herself to blush for her nakedness; and
more, you might have successfully “moved the court” to punish her for
the indecent exposure; and thus Truth, by the potency of your elo-
quence, might have been handed over to the scourging arm of the
beadle, whilst Falsehood, your successful client, should have gone
triumphant home, in a carriage-and-four, with white favours . These
golden times are past. Then, you might have walked the Hall,
gowned and wigged with a harlot tongue to let for hire, carrying any
suit into court, as a porter carries any load; then at the Old Bailey
you might even have shaken hands with avowed murder in his cell,
and fresh from the blood-shot eye, and charnel breath of homicide, have
called heaven, and its angels, to witness to the purity of the cut-throat
who had paid you so many silver shillings for your exordium, your
metaphors, your peroration—your bullying of witnesses, your fierce
knocking at the startled hearts of half-bewildered jurymen; threat-
|ening the trembling twelve with midnight visits from the ghost of the
innocent creature in the dock, if the verdict went for hemp. This
you might have done, but this is past. Now, Conscience wigs itself,
and sits with open door, giving advice gratis. Therefore, can you
afford it in purse and, more; have you the necessary milkyness
of humanity—for such is the term simpletons give it—to play the
peace-maker between man and man, giving advice, allaying feuds,
reconciling neighbour to neighbour, weighing out Justice in her
golden scales, and charging not one marivedi for her trouble Can
you, as barrister, write up over your door—as may now be seen in
thousands of places—“Adrice giren against going to law, gratis.”
In the olden time, I should have advised you to make an effort for
the bar; but with the present romantic notions—for I can give them
no worthier name—operating on the profession, you can afford it
neither in pocket nor in spirit. To such an extent have barristers
carried their peace-making quixotism (of course considerably assisted
by their worthier brethren, the attorneys), that the judges have
nothing to do. Already the moth is eating up the official ermine !
Will you be a soldier —Well, I will presume you are a Field-
Marshal. A war breaks out: a wicked, unjust war. It may be
thought necessary (such a case occurred about a century ago, and may
occur again) to cut the throats of a few thousands of Chinese; for no
other reason than that the celestial Emperor hath, with his “vermilion
pencil,” written an edict against the swallowing of British opium.
Well you are ordered for the Chinese waters, to blow up, burn, slay,
sink—in a word to commit all the beautiful varieties of mischief in-
vented by the devil's toy-woman, Madame Bellona. Well, with the
spirit that is now growing in the army—a spirit that has lately de-
veloped itself in so many bright examples—you are compelled to
throw up in “sublime disgust,” your Marshal's baton, and like Cincin-
natus, retire to Battersea to cultivate cress and mustard; philosophi-
cally preferring those pungent vegetables to laurels stained with the

blood of the innocent, defiled with the tears of the orphan. You
may then send your epaulets to Holywell-street, to be burnt for the
gold—or sell your uniform to be used, on masquerade nights, at the
Lowther Arcade. My dear boy, military glory is not what it used to
be. Once people thought it a jewel—a solid ruby. But philosophy
has touched what seemed a gem, and has proved it to be only a bubble,
blown from blood.

“THE EYES OF THE WORLD.”
WHEN Mrs. JENKINson dubitates over the ribbon-box of the mercer,
and having fingered some fifty different ribbons, begs the shopman to
show her another lot, and then another—and then another—dear Mrs.
JENKINson thinks not so much of her individual taste, cares not so
much to gratify her own peculiar love of colour, as to satisfy—nay,
delight and astonish—the Eyes of the World ! How those Eyes will
hang upon her, when she trips and jerks before them ; her bonnet
radiant with—new trimmings How those Eyes will smile, and
sparkle, and brighten, at the brilliant hues, the lovely pattern, new
from the looms of Coventry ! How, on the other hand, the Eyes of
the World would have drooped, melancholy and dissatisfied—offended,
hurt, if dear MRs. JENKINson had selected the orange-coloured
ribbon with that vile sprig, in lieu of the beautiful maiden's-blush
with the divinest of flowers in it !
Lady Montpellien is trembling on the brink of forty. Every
day, that execrable truth-teller, her looking-glass, speaks of fading
lilies and roses. How can her Ladyship meet the Eyes of the World,
if not as fair and blushing, as when she first came out Lady Mont-
PELLIER makes to herself a new face from the cosmetics of the per-
fumer: she “paints inch-thick,” but purely out of respect for—the
Eyes of the World !
The Hon. Augustus MARKHAM is flung from his horse one
crowded Sunday in Hyde Park. "Tis a terrible case; for Auot stus
was remarkable, even at ALMAck's, for the beauty of his legs. There
is, however, a compound fracture, and poor Augustus must lose his
left leg a little below the knee. All goes on very favourably, and in
a short season the cure is complete. Of course, MARKHAM must be
propped upon a wooden leg. What a wooden leg : Meet the Eyes
of the World, supported by a vile piece of naked timber 1 Be self-
exhibited, a miserable cripple, hopping upon wood l Certainly not :
no, Augustus MARKHAM will have nothing but a cork leg. “I
assure you,” says the Surgeon, “in my opinion you will find a wooden
leg much more commodious; you will be able to walk better with it—
very much better.” “No doubt,” replies Augustus; “but then,
Doctor, I put it to you—how, how, with a wooden leg, should I look in
the-Eyes of the World t”
Honest PILBERRY—a good-natured and high-minded conveyancer
—has, within these two years, become grey, and partially bald. The
worthy Pilheh Ry was wont to smile complacently at his curling
raven locks; he believes, too, that they were curling and gracious in
the Eyes of the World. How, then, shall he appear in his present
plight, with a grizzled, half-naked head Î For our own part, we are
convinced that the sprinkle of white among the black, with a thinning
of his profuse tresses, has given him a look of loftiness, a sort of vene-
rable kindliness he had not before. No-no: PILBERRY sends for a
wig-maker, and straightway, sacrificing all his natural graces, buries
his head in artificial locks. The wig is excellently made ; neverthe-
less, something almost like an oath flutters to PILBERRY's lips when-
ever he glances at a mirror. “Ha! that I—with the locks I had—
that I should ever be brought to carry dead men's hair "“Then, my
dear PII.BERRY, why do you do so?” “Why God bless me ! how
can you ask the question ? How, how, without a wig, how do you
think I should look in—the Eyes of the World?”
Pretty LYDIA MELRose She had a nice little figure; straight as
a hazel twig : but—for the Eyes of the World—Lydia did not think
herself slender enough. Hence, she was laced and laced, and built
about with steel sufficient to forge into a cuirass. She moreover
eschewed the grossness of meat diet, and lived upon lemons, oranges,
almonds and raisins, and such acid light fare. And all this, that she
might appear an inch less in the waist to the-Eyes of the World !
Jack SplAsHLY was left five thousand pounds. In an evil hour
he became acquainted with young Lord FushALL, who had not as
many farthings. Jack played and played, and dressed and dressed,
his money running wastefully from his purse like sand from a broken
hour-glass. “My dear Jack,” said an old acquaintance, “I’m sure
you can't afford to ride a horse like that—no, nor to wear diamond
studs; nor to—” “My dear fellow,” answered Jack, “I quite agree
with what you say; but what am I to do Were I to do otherwise,
how the devil could I appear in the Eyes of the World !”
We have only taken six instances; we might deal in six thousand
—illustrative of the foolish sacrifices daily made to the Eyes of the
World; which, after all, watchful and intelligent as we deem them,
are nine times out of ten as insensible of the offerings we make to
them as are the stone and wooden idols of the heathem. The truth
is, the Eyes of the World have other employment than to look at us
and our doings; and even when they do condescend to give a single
glance at us, the chances are, that they either laugh in ridicule, or
leer in contempt. Often, when we think we have made them stare
again with admiration, they only stare in pity or disgust.
When Mrs. JENKINson appeared in church in her new ribbon,
what did the Eyes of the World Some of them looked towards the
pulpit—some at their prayer-books—but none at Mrs. JENKINson.
Yes; we forgot, two of the Eyes of the World, in the head of Mrs.
GRUNDY, saw the vanity, and the owner of the Eyes thus solilo-
quised—“Here, again, is that foolish, bedizened Mrs. JENKINson.
A plain ribbon would much better become her l’”
The Eyes of the World, looking at Lady Mont PELLIER, exclaim
—“What a pity that she should spoil the yet beautiful remains of
her beauty with so much filthy paint l’”
The Eyes of the World, glancing at MARKHAM's cork leg, and
seeing how uneasily he carries it, cry—“Well, certainly the man s a
fool not to prop himself upon wood l’”
PILBERRY's wig, flashed in the Eyes of the World, excites their
contempt. “What an ass is PILBERRY, if he thinks there's anybody
gulled by that wig 1"
Two of the Eyes of the World, in the head of a linendraper's ap-
prentice, deign to notice the waist of LYDIA MELRose. “What a
thing !” they cry, “you might put it in a pint-pot—I’d as soon throw
my arms round a rolling-pin " Poor Lydia 1 she thought the Eyes
of the World were staring at her, when they were only the hollow
Eyes of Death. At eighteen, vinegar, lemons, and tight lacing sent
her, riá consumption, to her grave.
As for Jack SPLAsHLY, he spent and dressed for the Eyes of the
World; and if they deign to look at him at all, it is through the bars
of a prison 1
If we would only consider the degree of intelligence in the Eyes
of the World—the small degree of attention towards ourselves
existing in them—if we would only think of the vacant, selfish, un-
reflecting stare of the Eyes of the World—or of that portion of it
which gazes at us—
Here, good artist, assist us with thy pencil

squinting, goggling, scowling things make up

THE LIGHT OF ALL NATIONS.
This glorious effort, to keep a rushlight constantly burning on the
Goodwin Sands, has not as yet experienced the success that the #. of
humanity could desire. A curious contrivance called a Cassoon was last
year taken down to Deal, and an enthusiastic mob were anxiously
watching its embarkation for the spot appointed for its reception, when,
by some untoward accident, the Cassoon got pitched overboard, and was
swamped in the harbour before the eyes of an agitated populace.
The exertions of a number of “friends to the good cause,” who may be
termed in this case “obstinate adherents of the swamped cassoon," have
succeeded, after a year's raking and poking among the sands, in fishing
up the remnants of the unfortunate machine, which has been riveted in
one place, soldered in another, joisted here, and spliced there, until the
fragments have been got into something like union. With this Cassoon,
a party of enthusiasts started off the other day to the Goodwin Sands, for
the purpose of fixing it as the contemplated candlestick in which the (rush)
Light of all Nations is destined to glimmer.
very thing went on in a very promising manner until the moment
arrived for fixing the Cassoon, when the obstinate machine fell head-fore-
most into the sand, and the top part is consequently firmly embedded
instead of the bottom.
What is to become of the “Light of all Nations” is now a very puzzling
question. We propose that as the Cassoon, or candlestick, is irretrievably
upside down, the original plan should be extended by placing the Light
of all Nations on the Save-all of the Universe, and appending to it the

(At least so writes your brother);
But of all things, you know, I hate
A calculating mother /
Emma, ma belle I pray wear the blue
That at the floral féte, love,
Such mark'd observance tow'rds you drew—
(Though all such ruse I hate, love).
But young Sir Harry may drop in
Before the evening closes;
I heard him praise your mouth and chin,
And say your lips were roses.
My sweetest Julia! let your hair
Fall lightly down your shoulders;
Those stiff French plaits on brows so fair
Lack taste to all beholders.
Sir Mark—Lord Lackland's eldest son,
Now canvassing the county—
Has been invited ; every one
Is speaking of his bounty.
He p'rhaps may come; his colours place
Careless—about your dress, love ;
A lurking penchant there I trace
For some one—you may guess love.
Fanny, my pet! that cheek's pale tint
Wants just a tinge to warm it:
Oblige me, dear; there's nothing in't ;
The leetlest touch won't harm it.
Clara'! that giraffe form, my dear,
Is best, I think, away ;
So you with Mad'moiselle St. Pierre
Must in the school-room stay.
Besides, that low consumptive cough
Is really quite distressing:
Some of your sisters must go off,
Ere I direct your dressing.
Bless me! is that the dinner bell
The half-hour's notice ringing?
Quick—to your chambers 1—weave the spell
To well-dress'd beauty clinging.
You've lunch'd at two ; now I entreat
All appetite you'll smother
At seven—men hate to see girls eat.
Heigho! who'd BE A Mother ?
ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS.
The Observatory at Greenwich has lately suffered considerably from
the rivalry of three or four pensioners on the top of the Hill, who have
added museums of natural history—on a small scale—to the more lofty
attractions of astronomy. We visited no less than four of these collections
last week, and were particularly gratified by the inspection of four dif:
ferent cockchafers under four different microscopes. We were induced
to look through one of the telescopes, and our attention was particularly
called to a spot on the glass, which we were informed was Windsor Castle.
We were also much pleased by the contemplation of a neighbouring tree
through one of the cut drops of a glass chandelier, when the single tree had
all the appearance of several. For this rich treat the visitor is not expected
to give more than sixpence to the gallant veteran who furnishes the means
of enjoying it. The stranger may sometimes, be fortunate enough to
obtain the use of a piece of coloured glass, which, if his imagination is
very powerful, may aid him in the idea that the scene is moonlight, if it
happens to be a bit of a green bottle that has been placed in his hand by
the accommodating “Heart of British Oak,” who charges nothing and
only expects a . silver coin for all the facilities afforded to the curious
in these matters.
We understand that the authorities at the Observatory are about to
remonstrate against the inroad made upon its peculiar province by the
Pensioners.

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON IDLER.
cHAPTER VII.-OF CERTAIN OTHER GENTs.
HEN the Concerts d'Eté usurped
the place of the regular drama at
* our theatres, and the attractions
of Kean and Macready yielded to
Koenig and Musard—when Juliet
was neglected for Jullien, Pro-
- of Henry IV. for the pistol of the
Z | Dunois quadrilles—the Gent was exceedingly
ºut gratified thereby. The Promenade became his
paradise; and he used to walk round and round,
in all the importance of a pair of cleaned kids,
which by a happy “economy of manufacture.”
far beyond the cheapest arrangement Mr. Bab-
bage could invent, had been revived and scented
at the same time for twopence. In the tour of
the house the Gent kept his face constantly
towards the audience (admiring the young ladies in the dress tier),
with the pertinacity of the grand banners in stage processions, which,
painted only on one side, appear to be endowed with some heliotropic
principle, that causes their emblazoned surfaces to revolve always
on the same plane with the footlights.
We were rather inquieted as to what the Gents would do when
these concerts were finally closed. We made great search, and
found at length that the majority emigrated to the musical taverns,
where, under the combined influence of Bellini, bottled beer, and
brandy-and-water, they contrived to get through the evening, deriving
additional excitement from the novelty of seeing Sonnambula per-
formed through a haze of tobacco-smoke.
But the grand gathering of Gents is alone to be met with, in one
universal réunion of all their varieties, on board the Sunday steam-
boats. No city in the world produces so many holiday specimens of
tawdry vulgarity as London; and the river appears to be the point
towards which all the countless myriads converge. Their strenuous
attempts to ape gentility—a bad style of word, we admit, but one pecu-
liarly adapted to our purpose—are to us more painful than ludicrous;
and the labouring man, dressed in the usual costume of his class, is
in our eyes far more respectable than the Gent, in his dreary efforts
to assume a style and tournure which he is so utterly incapable of
carrying out.
When joining a “steamboat excursion,” the Gent never sits on the
regular benches placed for that purpose. He prefers the top of the
cabin-door—the steps of the paddle-boxes—the platform on which
the steersman is elevated, and the like situations. Here you may
always see him with a questionable newspaper and a bottle of stout,
a light blue stock, and, being Sunday, a very new hat, and a pair of
clean white trousers; with Berlin gloves, which he carries in his
hand: for, indeed, not being used to them, nothing presents so per-
fect an idea of tolerated discomfort as a Sunday Gent in a pair of
gloves. We can only compare his hands, when suffering under the
spero for Prospere, and the Pistol
infliction, to those of a Guy Fawkes, or the tailors' dressed-up dum-
mies, before alluded to.
The Gent usually prefers travelling outside an omnibus, smoking a
cigar thereon, and sitting next to the driver, in order that
he may reap the benefit of his anecdotes and remarks con-
cerning the horses and vehicle, to which the Gent replies
at intervals, “Ah,” and “Yes,” and “I should say not,” and “Just
so,” with other expletive phrases of unmeaning dialogue. He speaks
also of “a party he knows,” and is much interested at hearing that
the off horse worked “in the fust buss as ever Shillibeer started, and
was took from the Padd’n’ton line to be put on the Elephant.” He
is also informed of the singular speculation in which “the guvner
give a fippun note for that little mare, and was offered eight sovrins
for her within a week, though she was a reg’lar bag o' bones;” upon
which the Gent observes that “very often those sort of horses are
the best:” having delivered himself of which opinion, he rolls his
cigar about in his mouth, gives a whiff, and then removes it between
his middle and ring finger, to offer it to another Gent, who begs the
favour of a light.
There is a species of Gent who, moving only in a third or
fourth-rate sphere, goes to a party in a white cravat, and turned-up
wrist-bands, and carries his hat into the room; he is generally an
immense card. We chanced to stand next to a specimen of this
kind one evening in a quadrille, and the only remark we heard him
make, was inquiring of his partner, after two or three false starts,
whether she preferred dancing on a carpet or the bare boards; to
which the young lady replied, having looked down to see what the
floor was, that she might not put her foot in it (figuratively speaking),
that she preferred a carpet she thought; and this was the beginning
and end of the conversation.
A sample of this variety fixed himself upon us the other day as we
were taking a stroll—merely upon the casual intimacy of an evening
party some two or three weeks before, where we had procured him
some trifle, solely because we did not choose to run the chance of
allowing him to approach the table, or stand near the pretty girl
over whose white shoulder we stretched our arm to help him.
We found out he was minutely particular about his deportment
in the street, and a pretty treat we gave him. First of all we rattled
our stick against all the area railings of the houses; then we bought
penny bunches of cherries at the stalls, and munched them as we
went along, continually pressing him to take some, or propelling the
stones, by six at a time, along the pavement in front of us. We cut off
the angles of all the squares, and ran very fast across all the crossings;
and then took off a little boy's cap and carried it a short way with us,
to provoke a few salutations in our wake, of that pleasing and forcible
kind which only little boys can give with such piquancy of expression.
We finally got rid of him, by insisting upon stopping at the corner of
Berner's Street to see Punch—an exhibition we never, by any means,
omit playing audience to ; although we know many Gents who think
their station in society would be lost for ever, were they once observed
taking the slightest interest in anything so common.
MISS TICKLETOBY'S LECTURES ON
ENGLISH HISTORY.
LECTURE IV.-EDWARD THE Cox FESSOR.-HAROLD.—WILLIAM
THE CONQUEROR.
ING CANUTE, whose adventures at the
watering-place my young friend Mr. Simcoe
described last week in such exquisite verse
(and I am afraid that the doings at watering-
places are not often so moral), died soon after,
having repented greatly of his sins. It must
have been Graves-end, I think, where the king
grew so thoughtful.
[Here Miss T. was rather disappointed that
nobody laughed at her pun ; the fact is, that
Miss , the usher, had been ordered to do
so, but, as usual, missed her point.]
Before he died, he made a queer sort of reparation for all the sins,
robberies, and murders that he committed—he put his crown on the
head of the statue of a saint in Canterbury, and endowed no end of
monasteries. And a great satisfaction it must have been to the
relatives of the murdered people, to see the king's crown on the
saint's head; and a great consolation to those who had been robbed,
to find the king paid over all their money to the monks.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 71
Some descendants of his succeeded him, about whom there is
nothing particular to say, nor about King Edward the Confessor, of
the Saxon race, who succeeded to the throne when the Danish
family failed, and who was canonised by a Pope two hundred years
after his death—his holiness only knows why.
Spooney, my dears, is a strong term, and one which, by a sensitive
female, ought to be employed only occasionally; but Spoon EY, I
emphatically repeat (immense sensation), is the only word to cha-
racterise this last of the regular Saxon kings. He spent his time at
church, and let his kingdom go to rack and ruin. He had a pretty
wife, whom he never had the spirit to go near ; and he died, leaving
his kingdom to be taken by any one who could get it.
A strong gallant young fellow, Harold by name, stepped forward,
and put the crown on his head, and vowed to wear it like a man.
Harold was the son of Earl Godwin that we spoke of in the last
lecture, a great resolute fellow, who had been fighting King Edward's
enemies while the king was singing psalms, and praying the saints to
get rid of them, and turned out with a sword in his hand, and a coat
of mail on his body, whilst the silly king staid at home in a hair
shirt, scourging and mortifying his useless old body.
Harold then took the crown (though, to be sure, he had no right to
it, for there was a nephew of the late king, who ought to have been
first served), but he was not allowed to keep undisturbed possession
of it very long, for the fact is, somebody else wanted it.
You all know who this was—no other than William, Duke of
Normandy, a great and gallant prince (though I must say his mother
was no better than she should be "), who had long had a wish to
possess the noble realm of England, as soon as the silly old Confessor
was no more. Indeed, when Harold was abroad, William had told
him as much, making him swear to help him in the undertaking.
Harold swore, as how could he help it? for William told him he
would have his head off if he didn't, and then broke his oath on the
first opportunity.
Some nine months, then, after Harold had assumed the crown, and
just as he had come from killing one of his brothers, (they were
pretty quarrelsome families, my dears, in those days,) who had come
to England on a robbing excursion, Harold was informed that the
Duke of Normandy had landed with a numerous army of horse, foot,
and marines, and proposed, as usual, to stay.
Down he went as fast as the coach could carry him, (for the Kentish
railroad was not then open,) and found Duke William at Hastings,
where both parties prepared for a fight.
You, my darlings, know the upshot of the battle very well; and
though I’m a delicate and sensitive female; and though the Battle of
Hastings occurred—let me see, take 1066 from 1842—exactly seven
hundred and seventy-six years ago; yet I can't help feeling angry to
think that those beggarly, murderous Frenchmen should have beaten
our honest English as they did—(Cries of “Never mind, we've given
it 'em since.”)—Yes, my dears, Ilike that spirit—we have given it'em
since, as the Duke of Wellington at Badajos, and my late lamented
br-r-other, Ensign Samuel T-t-tickletoby, at B-b-bunhill Row, can
testify.—(The lecturer's voice was here choked with emotion, owing
to the early death of the latter lamented hero.)—But don't let us be
too eager for military glory, my friends. Look! we are angry be-
cause the French beat us eight hundred years ago! And do you sup-
pose they are not angry because we beat them some five-and-twenty
years back?, Alas! and alas ! this is always the way with that fight-
ing; you can't satisfy both parties with it, and I do heartily hope that
one day there'll be no such thing as a soldier left in all Europe—(A
voice, “And no police neither.”)
Harold being dead, His Majesty, King William—of whom, as he
now became our legitimate sovereign, it behoves every loyal heart to
speak with respect—took possession of England, and, as is natural,
gave all the good places at his disposal to his party. He turned out
the English noblemen from their castles, and put his Norman soldiers
and knights into them. He and his people had it all their own way;
and though the English frequently rebelled, yet the king managed to
quell all such disturbances, and reigned over us for one-and-twenty
years. He was a gallant soldier, truly—stern, wise, and prudent, as far
as his own interests were concerned, and looked up to by all other
Majesties as an illustrious monarch.
But great as he was in public, he was rather uncomfortable in
his family, on account of a set of unruly sons whom he had—for their
Royal Highnesses were always quarrelling together. It is related
that one day being at tea with her Majesty the Queen, and the young
Princes, at one of his castles in Normandy, (for he used this country
to rob it chiefly, and not to live in it,) a quarrel ensued, which was
* Miss. Tickletoby's rancour against Edward's treatment of his wife, and her
ºneer at the Conqueror's mother, are characteristic of her amiable sex.
certainly very disgraceful. Fancy, my darlings, three young princes
sitting at tea with their papa and mama, and being so rude as to be-
gin throwing water at one another | The two younger, H.R.H. Prince
William, and H.R.H. Prince Henry, actually flung the slop-basin, or
some such thing, into the face of H.R.H. Prince Robert, the King's
eldest son. -
H. R. Highness was in a furious rage, although his brothers declared
that they were only in play; but he swore that they had insulted him ;
that his papa and mama favoured them and not him, and drawing
his sword, vowed that he would have their lives. His Majesty with
some difficulty got the young princes out of the way, but nothing
would appease Robert, who left the castle vowing vengeance. This
passionate and self-willed young man was called Court-hose, which
means in French short inexpressibles, and he was said to have worn
shorts, because his limbs were of that kind.
Prince Shorts fled to a castle belonging to the King of France, who
was quite jealous of Duke Robert, and was anxious to set his family
by the ears; and the young Prince began forthwith robbing his
father's dominions, on which that monarch marched with an army to
besiege him in his castle.
Here an incident befel, which while it shows that Prince Robert
(for all the shortness of his legs) had a kind and brave heart, will at
the same time point out to my beloved pupils the dangers—the awful
dangers of disobedience. Prince Robert and his knights sallied out
one day against the besiegers, and engaged the horsemen of their
party. Seeing a warrior on the other side doing a great deal of exe-
cution, Prince Robert galloped at him sword in hand, and engaged
him. Their vizors were down, and they banged away at each other,
like—like good-uns. (Hear, hear.)
At last Prince Robert hit the other such a blow, that he felled him
from his horse, and the big man tumbling off cried “Oh, murder P’ or
“Oh, I'm done for 1" or something of the sort.
Fancy the consternation of Prince Robert when he recognised the
voice of his own father He flung himself off his saddle as quick as

his little legs would let him, ran to his father, knelt down before him,
besought him to forgive him, and begged him to take his horse and
ride home. The king took the horse, but I’m sorry to say he only
abused his son, and rode home as sulky as possible.
However he came soon to be in a good humour, acknowledged that
his son Prince Shortlegs was an honest fellow, and forgave him, and
they fought some battles together, not against each other, but riding
bravely side by side.
So having prospered in all his undertakings, and being a great
Prince and going to wage war against the French King, who had

- ------
offended him, and whose dominions he vowed to set in a flame, the
famous King William of England, having grown very fat in his
old age, received a hurt while riding, which made him put a stop to
his projects of massacring the Frenchmen, for he felt that his hour of
death was come.
As usual, after a life of violence, blood, and rapine, he began to
repent on his death-bed ; uttered some religious sentences which the
chroniclers have recorded, and gave a great quantity of the money
which he had robbed from the people to the convents and priests.
The moment the breath was out of the great king's body, all the
courtiers ran off to their castles expecting a war. All the abbots
went to their abbeys, where they shut themselves up. All the shop-
keepers closed their stalls, looking out for riot and plunder, and the
king's body being left quite alone, the servants pillaged the house
where he lay, leaving the corpse almost naked on the bed. And this
was the way they served the greatest man in Christendom . [Much
sensation, in the midst of which the lecturer retired.]
3Foreign intelligente.
OUR letters from Chelsea speak of some rejoicings at Cremorne House,
on the occasion of a local marriage. Gymnastic exercises were proposed,
and the chivalric game of the sandbag was played with great spirit by a
few knightly individuals, who allowed themselves to be levelled to the
turf with much British bravery. The Quintain was also resorted to, but
the wooden machinery having got the dry-rot, a great deal of useless
valour was expended; for, on the first blow, the whole affair fell to
atoms. Nevertheless, the company were much delighted with this tell-
porary return to the valiant customs of the days of chivalry.
A scene in kenilwonth.
The Viceroy of Hammersmith had been confined to his lodgings by a
severe hoarseness, which had prevented him from issuing the usual
mandates. Several pilgrims have passed through the town in pursuit of
health, and many have stopped at the pump to take the waters.
The Gas-light question is likely to be revived next winter at Kensing-
ton; and those heart-burnings which have been allowed to sleep during
the long days, when it has continued light until a late hour, will most
probably break out during the autumn and winter with increased
bitterness.
-
THE GROTTOS.
These interesting structures were extremely numerous last week
throughout the Metropolis, and in most of the suburbs. The prevailin
style of architecture was Composite, and the dome-like roof was j
to be decidedly the favourite. Smirke's celebrated cupola was much
copied, and Wren's Gothic arch was evidently the pattern that had been
followed in designing the aperture to admit the rushlight.
As the Grottos are emphatically public buildings, we can have no hesita-
tion in alluding to them; and indeed it is a remarkable circumstance in
the history of our own time that the Metropolis should be annually adorned
by the simultaneous erection, in every quarter, of shelly edifices, which are
all produced without the aid of capital, and by the means of juvenile
industry. The public were freely invited to view the buildings; and the
stranger had an opportunity of inspecting, a very interesting series of
exteriors. It it true that the youthful architects were rather urgent in
their attempts to levy a tax, though trifling, on the pockets of the pas-
senger; but this is an evil which has been always complained of with
reference to public buildings in this country. It is to be hoped that an
legislation on this subject will be framed with a view to the Grottos, º
are at present disgraced by a system of paltry importunity for petty sums
under the plea of retaining the erections in the memory, and the .
phrase of “Remember the Grotto’’ is consequently intruded on the ears
of the passenger.
A PAGE FROM “THE GREAT METROPOLIS."
Apjoining the House of Lords is a public-house which enjoys the ex-
clusive patronage of the coachmen and footmen in waiting upon the here-
ditary wisdom of the empire.
Some years ago it was discovered that one-third of these motley gentle-
men rejoiced in the name of Smith, one-sixth in the name of Brown, and
one-sixth in the name of Jones, whilst the remaining third had their
patronymics from the varied columns of Pigot's Directory.
In order to remedy the confusion consequent upon this unfortunate si-
milarity of names, It was enacted :
“That on and from the 12th day of June, 1839, every Member of
this Honourable Public House shall be spoken of and spoken to by the
title and designation of the fortunate individual who has the honour of
paying him his wages, and supplying him his livery. And be it further
enacted, that should any Member of this Honourable Public House
| infringe the above regulations, he shall be liable to pay for as many glasses
of “hot with' or “cold without’, as there are gentlemen's gentlemen
present.”

Where a low pile of oyster-shells marks out the spot;
While a candle within seems to say, as 'tis burning,
“Flare up once a-year, and remember the grot.”

OPENING OF THE OYSTER SEASON.
This glorious festival came off last week with all the éclat of former
ears; and our own reporter having been despatched to the spot, we are
enabled to give the following particulars:
Billingsgate was a scene of bustle and confusion from first to last, and
vehicles of every description were waiting on the beach, to do honour to
native worth in the usual manner.
Mr. Goldham, the Inspector of Fish, whose duty it is to rub his nose
every morning along the whole line of fish-stalls, was very soon upon the
ground, having slipped on a piece of orange-peel at the entrance of the
imarket. Mr. Goldham wore the insignia of the Doubtful Mackarel, and
was looking remarkably well. He was preceded by a division of police;
and having gone through the awful ceremony of condemning a quart of
stale shrimps, he gave a long audience to a suspicious-looking flounder,
which was, however, permitted to remain in the market.
The grand ceremony of the day at length commenced ; and, in looking
from that busy shore on to those well-laden vessels, it was impossible that
the bosom of the spectator should not feel a thrill of pride; as he said to
himself, “Those—those are English craft ; and this—ay, this—is British
commerce l’ Mr. Goldham, who had been looking remarkably well all
the morning, now began to look considerably better; for the flush. of
ambition lighted up his features, as he surveyed the Oyster fleet riding
before him in the offing of Billingsgate.
At precisely the proper hour the word, was given to land; when the
coast was immediately thronged with natives, some carried in sacks on
the shoulders of the people, and others brought in basket-loads on to the
beach, where Mr. Goldham, having in vain endeavoured to preserve his
dignity, was at length regularly run down, and compelled to seek the
hospitality of an adjacent wine-vault.
THE NATURAL HISTORY OF COURTSHIP.
CHAPTER VI.-Of what A MAN DOEs when HE IS REJECTED.
THE astonishment of Apollo when he was kicked out of Heaven—
the surprise of Sancho Panza when disappointed of his dukedom—
the wonder of Joseph Hume when out-voted at Leeds, were tame,
quiet manifestations of chagrin compared with those which break
from a man who is rejected. -
The man who is rejected jumps into his cab, and being determined
to drive home and hide his despair in the deepest recesses of the
Albany, gallops off in a contrary direction, at a rate which causes
sober wayfarers to keep close to the wall, and basket-women to
tremble for their stalls. Being suddenly brought to a halt by a
regiment of brewers' drags in the City, he comes for a moment to
his senses, and makes up his mind to visit his banker, from whom he
demands letters of credit upon every town or city from Calais to
Pesth, having suddenly formed a desire to scamper over the Conti-
nent of Europe, and to bury his sorrows in the deserts of Arabia,
instead of his chambers in the Albany.
Notwithstanding this stern determination, he gets, somehow or
other, to his rooms at an early hour the next morning, and flings
himself on the bed. During a restless sleep, his brain is visited with
an exquisite amalgam, in which the hopes, disappointments, events,
and determinations of the past day are mixed up in tortuous con-
fusion. An angel in Brussels lace and butterfly's wings is first
presented to his disordered imagination, in the likeness of Rose
Robinson (for we are tearing a leaf out of the history of Frank
Kennedy, which, nevertheless, fits the records of most rejected
lovers), who appears as an Eastern houri, torn from his arms by
the Honourable Mrs. Couple, in the form of an Arabian Bedouin,
who drags her from his longing arms upon a brewer's dray, driven
by an Hungarian Chief across the frontiers of Prussia, to the eastern
extremity of Cheapside. He then fancies himself at his banker's,
playing at short whist, and—transforming the clerks into waiters at
Evans's ;-when asked “how he will take” his check for five hundred
pounds, desires it in “sheep's kidneys, stewed in cayenne, and fried
in brandy,” with a bowl of punch made of Guinness's stout, and
Moet's champagne. Whilst the senior cashier is singing “The
Humours of a Country Fair,” he espies Sir Charles Simper talking
to the houris at the bar in Brussels lace and butterfly's wings;
whereupon he finds himself in Battersea Fields, directly opposite to
a screw barrel, himself discharging another, loaded to the muzzle.
At last he wakes with his nightcap pulled tightly over his face, and
a choking sensation in his throat—such as is felt by persons a few
weeks after they have been found out in a murder.
Returning consciousness brings its desolation, together with an
active curiosity about the taste of prussic acid, and he wonders if he
were to send for an ounce of magnesia, whether the apothecary's
apprentice could be kind enough to make a mistake, and supply in
its place sugar-of-lead. At all risks he orders soda-water and strong
coffee, with writing materials to follow; desiring his servant, mean-
time, to clean his duelling-pistols.
Having dressed and settled himself before his writing-desk, he
selects a sharp-pointed pen, and determines to give the wayward
lady another chance; for of course, she has by this time, quite
repented of her refusal. After breaking the nebs of several steel
pens and bitten two or three quills into shreds, he boldly inscribes
upon the paper these words—“After the agony, I have suffered,”-
and then waits another visitation from the epistolary Muses, with
upturned eyes and intense resignation. But a moment's considera-
tion assures him that “agony” is not a happy expression, so in:
discriminately applied as it is to the toothache and the feelings of
the heart; he therefore scores it out and substitutes “torture;’ by
which time he is inspired with another brilliant member of the
sentence by adding to “After the torture I have suffered” a piece of
pleasing intelligence in the words “I sit down"—then, at the end of
another pause, “to express”—what, he is unable at the moment to
make up his mind.
This half-sentence having completely exhausted his epistolary
treasury, he suddenly remembers an adage which declares that none
but the courageous deserve the favour of the fair; and he thinks
it his duty to call his rival out. With a degree of alacrity and
readiness which would do honour to a Treasury secretary, he pens a
note to a friend in the Army to come to him immediately, occupying
the interval by hunting up from the corners of his memory some
decent excuse for asking his antagonist to be so good as to stand up
to be shot at. Having recollected, that at the club on the previous
evening, he had put forth a flat contradiction to an assertion of the
rejected that the Bishop of Jerusalem wore a silk apron on landing
at Alexandria, he sends by his friend the Major an application for
instant apology, which, if carefully nursed and skilfully fermented, he
trusts will, with care and the blessings of good management, come to
a speedy duel.
Having eased his conscience in this matter, he actually accom-
plishes a letter of expostulation to his adored, and awaits the answer
in tremulous expectation. He knows well enough what will be its
purport—it will evince a mortification of her rejection. In that
case, he will have a good mind to take her at her word, and never
see her more 1 Yet—can he be cruel! Can he let remorse lie like
a worm i' the bud, and feed on her damask cheek? Can he relent-
lessly marry the tailer's widow with a plum, to spite the lovely Rose
with a mere twenty-three thousand Forbid it, feeling ! forbid it,
generosity He will respond to her forthcoming half-retracting note
in a gentle, forgiving spirit. He will not disappoint her—fickle, capri-
cious as she has been. In short, he will on no account whatever
break her heart. -
With this charitable resolve, the rejected takes up the news-

conspicuous column, that there is to be a marriage in high life; and—
terrible suspicion l—that the initials which the reporter is only
entrusted to print correspond with those of his rival and his
rejectress.
His suspicions are confirmed by the next post, which brings his

add to his misfortunes, some bungling has occurred about the duel,
and it cannot come off. He becomes reckless, and goes over to
Boulogne, plays, walks on the pier, criticises the fish-women, and gets
tired of France. Having made an arrangement with his creditors, he
returns to London to spread havoc amongst the hearts of all un-
married well-dowered damsels or widows he may happen to meet
with.
THE INCOME-TAX.
THE assessors are delivering documents to be filled up with the
amount of income, and PUNCH has received a paper, but is unable to
fill it up for various reasons. The greater part of Punch's assets are
collected in a hat, and he generally spends all his money without
counting it, so that the assessor must be a clever fellow if he ever
finds out what it comes to. PUNCH never could yet, and he does not
think he ever will accomplish so mice an arithmetical achievement.
It has been liberally arranged by the Government that every man
shall be allowed twenty-one days to ascertain the amount of his
income. Our creditors have been several years trying to get at our
income, but all their efforts have been hitherto quite unavailing.
Whether the assessor will be able to overcome the difficulty remains
to be proved.
The shareholders in Waterloo Bridge have had all the money

hundred pound shares, which are worth about one pound seventeen
in the market. This circumstance leaves them the agreeable option
of liquidating the interest on the new, the old, and the middle-aged
debt out of their own pockets.
The Hammersmith Bridge toll-man, who takes about enough money
in the week to pay his own salary, has been called upon to pay the
whole amount into the public treasury, as a portion of the Income-tax
due from the shareholders.
SONGS OF THE SEEDY.—No. XX.
The world ! I hate it; let me quaff
Oblivion's nectar by the quart;
Ha, ha! mine is the maniac's laugh,
The gong that drowns the voice of thought.

Think ye, I quail beneath your gaze 2
Sneer on ; I wear a cloak, 'tis true,
In one of August's hottest days
Well, what of that P Why, how ye stare,
And how ye grin Ay, grin again:
You ask me why the cloak I wear;--
It is not cold—it does not rain.
'Tis true, the sun, with scorching heat,
Inflames creation's thirsty throat.
You stare, a thick cloth cloak to meet
Ha, ha! I've pawn'd my only coat.
Why, how ye jeer! you call me swell,
And say “at no price he will do.”
That's right, my cloak! wrap round me well;
I have no friend—no friend, but you.
I weep—what I : that laugh’d so loudf
No! dry my tears, kind August sun;
Such feelings are not for the crowd:
My cloak, keep close—we'll cut and run.
FUSTIAN JACKETS
In merry England, labour is ignominy. Your only man is the man
with white hands and filbert nails. Kim himself, though soiled with
the sweat of Paradise, loses his dignity in his labour. This is a doctrine
preached from all the high places of England; enforced by public door-
keepers and small park rangers. True respectability lives and grows fat
upon the labour of others; it being the more respectable in proportion to
the number of hands that feed it. He who digs, or hews, or spins, is a
varlet ; he who profits by the work, the true man.
In the House of Commons, only a night or two since,' Mr. C. Buller
adduced a new illustration of this truth. He said the keepers of St.
James's Park were particularly ordered “not to admit persons who wore
fustian iackets.”
The Earl of LINcoLN replied : “Men in their working-dress -
very well go along the Birdcage-walk.” 9 es might
rustian.
Surely, here is a sufficient provision for the pedestrian wants of labour;
it may not, if in its working dress, intrude upon the greensward of St.
James's, but it may, “like a guilty thing,” slink along the Birdcage-walk ;
or, as the Earl humanely added, “the other outer passages.” The fustian
jacket is a social abomination—the livery of ignominious labour, and only
to be suffered with due discretion to approach the precincts of the royal
palace. Is it the Earl of LINcoln's fault if labouring men will persist in
wearing the objectionable habit? Is the Earl to be blamed if nters,
plumbers, house-painters, and others, will obstinately refuse to do their
daily work in superfine Saxony
–
supertriNE saxon.
However, it is gratifying to know that the labouring man has some-
times his honours. At the recent Agricultural Meeting, held at Bristol,
the “health of the labourer’’ was drunk. There was no one labourer
present—not even a sample of the animal at a side-table. Neither do we
hear that any dinner has been provided for him by the meeting in his
own county. Of this, however, we are assured—his health was drunk I
REVIVAL OF TRADE.
We are happy to hear good accounts of the revival of trade in all quar-
ters. Peg-tops have taken a decided turn, and the spinners are in full
employ in all directions. Marbles have been buoyant, as usual; and
though battledores have remained on hand, shuttlecocks have kept up
with all their accustomed lightness.
In provisions a good deal has been done ; and the commencement of
the oyster season has given an impetus to the food-market, of which all
parties will feel the benefit. From a return of shells picked up at the
Marsh Gate, it would appear that thirty dozen were sold over the barrel
to casual purchasers in the course of the week; but we regret to say that
the adjacent whelk-stall suffered materially in consequence. This result
was, however, unavoidable ; but from the number of whelks entered in-
wards to the large jar, after having entered outwards into the saucer, we
fear that the depression in that business must be considerable. The tariff
which admits vegetables at a low rate has been the means of letting in
greens to some extent, for a number of persons have speculated in water-
cresses, and imported several cargoes which have all turned mouldy in
the Custom-house.
A HUMOROUS FOOL.
It will be seen by a paragraph in the papers that the smallest horse in
the world has been presented to Her Majesty. We understand that Mr.
Hume has offered his services to the Sovereign, which, if accepted, will
place not only the smallest horse, but the greatest ass (by his own confes-
sion), at the disposal of Royalty.

SOME NEW JOKES.
THE facetious gentlemen who, together, form the directing force
of the Shakspere Society, have given to the world, in their last re-
print, a highly humorous work, entitled “Ben Jonson's Conversa-
tions with Drummond of Hawthornden.”
Several pleasant jests and conceits are introduced, from which we
discover that the chief wit of our forefathers consisted in the total
absence of point from any of their jokes, as the following extracts
will prove.
“He (Jonson) heth consumed a whole night in lying looking at his great toe,
about which he heth seen Tartars and Turks, Romans and Carthaginians, feight
in his imagination.”
“Queen Elizabeth never saw herself after she became old in a true glass: they
painted her, and sometymes would vermilion her nose.”
“In a profound contemplation, a student of Oxeford ran over a man in the
fields, and walked 12 miles ere he knew what he was doing.”
Cum multis aliis.
Now if these are esteemed valuable jests, probably future ages may
place the same value on those we subjoin, which, we are of opinion,
possess a sharpness and depth rarely met with in collections of the
same kind.
PICTORIAL JOKE.
Nox ERAT.—HoRAce, ode xiv.
A SHARP REPLY.
Curran, the celebrated Irish wit, met a friend one day in Sackville-street,
Dublin, who observed, “Why, Curran, you look warm.” The facetious
humourist replied, “And so would you too, if you had not thrown pearls
before swine?”
ePIGRAM.
Quoth Dick to Tom, “What is the cause
That Harley gets so much applause 2"
Quoth Tom, “The reason is quite clear—
He puts no soda in his beer.”
TIT FOR TAT.
A sharp lad once observed to a recruiting officer, “The difference between
us is, that you serve the Queen, and I clean shoes; ” whereupon the soldier, not
relishing the joke, replied, “Ay, but who wears them?”
A severe HIT.
Horace Walpole had a natural antipathy to mustard and cress. Colley
Cibber knowing this, one day said to him, before Mrs. Clive, “I wonder you
should dislike small salad, seeing that you live so near Richmond.” Walpole
laughed at the joke, but never forgave the sarcasm.
IRISH BULL.
“Halloo, Pat, my jewel,” said one bricklayer to another, “how's yourself
this iligant morning?” “By de powers,” said Pat, “I’m not well at all at
all.” “Is it ill you mane?” asked the other. “Arrah, no,” replied Pat;
how can a man be ill when he's got no mortar *"

Qſìjeatrical intelligente.
By the “Observer’s” own Correspondent.)
WE have heard it whispered—but we only believe half what we
| hear, and that half, by-the-bye, is generally the wrong half–that
Covent Garden is to open next month, which, it is stated in some
quarters, will be September, but this we do not say with certainty.
Charles Kemble (or perhaps we ought rather to say Mr. Kemble,
for he is the oldest member of his family now living, unless there were
any born before his brother John, who was the first of the race, in
date as well as in talent) is making preparations for the approaching
campaign. Whether his daughter (or rather we ought to say daugh-
ters, for he has two, besides another that makes three; and, indeed,
may have four, for what we know,) will appear in tragedy, is not yet
settled. Mr. Butler (who is not the tragedian of that name who, it
will be remembered, came out as “Hamlet,” and played a round of
characters at some of the minor theatres, to say nothing of “Carac-
tacus,” which Planché did for Drury Lane, and which he had a full
right to do, particularly if he was paid a large sum, which we do not
think he ever was, or ever will be—for it is not likely if he did not
get the money when it was due, that he should receive it seven
years afterwards— besides the Statute of Limitations would bar
the debt, unless he got anything on account, which in these days of
theatrical depression is out of the question) is said to have an objec.
tion to his wife's re-appearance.
Operas are to be the chief feature during the next season at Covent
Garden, and Mr. Macready will, of course, give his attention to tra-
gedy, unless he should change his mind—which is not at all likely—
and devote himself to the study of music, which he would have a per-
fect right to do if he thought he could obtain 400l. or even 300l.
a-night by doing so. Mr. Macready is certainly our first tragedian
in the present state of the stage ; and if he can act better than any
one else, we think he will do wisely in putting himself into the chief
characters. If it were worth his while to try Mr. Keeley in Coriola-
nus, of course he would be justified in doing so ; though we do not
say that he will; and indeed if we did say so, it might very likely
happen that we were wrong, as we generally are, at least a dozen
times in half-a-dozen paragraphs.
CONNUBIAL HOOKS-AND-EYES.
Mr. Punch, I married Simcox eight years ago; at which time my
gowns were fastened by eight hooks and eyes. Now, Sir, you will readily
conceive that no woman can completely hook-and-eye herself. Whilst a
spinster, she obtains the aid of her sister, cousin, mother, or Betty the
maid. When she becomes a married woman, the hook-and-eye duty natu-
rally devolves upon the husband.
HU3BANDRY.
For the first year of my marriage, Simcox, like an affectionate husband,
hooked-and-eyed the whole eight: the second year, he somewhat peevishly
restricted his attentions to seven ; the third, to six ; the fourth, to five ;
the fifth, to four ; and so on decreasing, until this morning—the anniver.
sary of our eighth wedding-day—when you would have supposed him pos-
sessed by the dearest and fondest recollections, he dropped another hook-
and-eye, intimating to me, that for the term of his natural life he should
restrict himself to one—the hook-and-eye at the top !
As I know, Mr. Punch, you have a crowd of female readers, I thought
it a duty I owed to my sex to warn them, through the medium of your
columns, of the craftiness, and—Imust say it—theselfishness of man. They
will, I hope, take warning by my condition, and, ere they enter matri-
mony, stipulate for a due performance of toilette attention on the part of
their husbands. Whilst in our pride we women remember that marriage
has its bonds, let not the men forget that it also has its Hooks-and-Eyes.
Yours, AMELIA SIMcox.
STEAM-BOAT STATISTICS.
WE find by statistical returns that there are about thirty steam-boats
running between London Bridge and Richmond, all of which have at dif-
ferent times run against the tide, while twenty-five have had the benefit of
the wind on some occasions. Sixteen have run aground, and twelve have
run into fourteen, while the remaining six have dashed against the bridges.
Out of thirty Captains, two have served in the Royal Navy as cabin-boys,
sixteen have been in the Merchant Service as bargemen, and all have
rowed wherries between London and Westminster. Of thirty bottles of
ginger-beer taken on board by one steward, eight have been sold, fifteen
have burst, and seven remain on hand at present. There have been ten
boxes of cigars carried within the last twelve months in all the thirty
vessels, out of which two of the boxes have been stolen, the contents of one
have been sold, and the remainder still form part of the cargo.
A SINGULAR CASE OF INDIGESTION.
We regret to state that the Hen Ostrich at the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park,
is indisposed in consequence of swallowing an iron garden-roller which had been
incautiously left in her way.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE KING OF OUDE.
His Oudian Majesty has at last departed this life, and as the name of
the King of Oude must be familiar to most of our readers, on account of
the sauce which is being continually advertised, we give a few particulars.
The King of Oude devoted the . of his great abilities to the concoc-
tion of a sauce which should eclipse the highest efforts of Harvey, and his
Majesty had at last the satisfaction of inventing a mixture, with which his
name will be handed down to a very remote posterity.
An Essay on The sole.
A revolutionary spirit having seized the subjects of the Oudian King,
he found himself without a revenue, and his fine mind was soon de-
voted to the task of supplying the deficiency. . The sauce was the happy
result, and his successor on the throne of Oude is, of course, the heir to
the celebrated condiment. Many tales have been fabricated as to the
origin of this relishing discovery; and some have gone so far as to say
that the King of Oude, resolving to stand no longer the sauce of his
subjects, applied himself to the preparation of a sauce of his own.
However this may be, the sauce is not only the most profitable, but the
most renowned of all the possessions that the King of Oude has left to
his successor.
MR. WARNER'S DISCOVERY.
WE have been favoured by Mr. Warner with an interview on the
subject of his grand discovery, when the following dialogue took
place between ourselves and the modest enthusiast, who only wants
half a million of money as a “bird in hand” before he lets the
Minister know what he has got “in the bush”—that is to say, in
the brains under his hair
Waisting his substance.
Punch received Mr. Warner in the Office in Wellington-street:
The time chosen was daybreak, in order that the “great secret”
might not be overheard; and our boy ingeniously placed his cap over
the opening of our letter-box, lest a syllable should escape through
the aperture.
PUNCH began by asking what the nature of the invention really
was ; when Mr. Warner explained as follows:–
“I take,” said the inventor, “an explosive substance, and forming
it into a solvent, I make a fulcrum, by an irregular process; I then
apply the whole to an opposing entity, and if that entity is a fleet or
a fortress, I either blow it up, or I do not.”
Punch.-"Ah-ah I see what you mean: you dip the end of a
diaculous preparation into a washy diluent, and having applied the
phosphate of potatoes to the ammonia of pickled cabbage, you accom-
plish what you wish. That is it, if I apprehend you rightly.”
Mr. Warner confessed that was the nearest explanation he could
give of his discovery.
Punch-"And now—as to its powers. You undertake to blow
up a fleet at six miles' distance f"
Mr. Warner.—“I do.”
Punch.-"Do you mean to say that you could blow up the
Bachelor steam-boat in its moorings at Battersea, if you were standing
at the six-mile-stone on the Great North Road "
Mr. Warner would also pledge himself to that, if £400,000 were
first paid into his hand and secured to him.
Purch.-*I see your meaning exactly. You have only to con-
vey a stream of electro-galvanism down a given avenue of an
unlimited length, and by placing the aim within your reach you gain
your object. For instance, you could empty the Treasury at one
blow, spiking the public pocket, and scuttling the pay-office, if every
facility were given you. Am I right in the view I take of your
meaning?”
Mr. Warner.—“Quite so. The fulcrum I wish to get into my
hands is £400,000; and then I must be allowed to go a long way off,
when I will give a specimen of what I meant by my discovery.”
Punch.-‘You are a credit, sir, to your country. The trick,
which I fully comprehend, is a capital one ; and it is very hard that
they will not give you an opportunity of playing it.”
The interview ended by Punch promising to make the merits
of the thing known in their true force; and advised that Sir F.
Burdett should be applied to as the most fit person to advocate the
claims of the inventor in Parliament.
REMINISCENCES OF A STETHOSCOPE.
The earliest recollection of my infancy carries me back to the counter
of Mr. Weiss, in the Strand. Being well-shaped, good-looking, and
portable, I attracted the notice of Dr. Hammer Roses, who became my
purchaser. I was soon introduced into society, and gained the confidence
of hundreds.
I accompanied the Dr. Hammer Roses soon after I entered his service, to
visit a sweet and delicate young girl, who was said to have an affection
of the heart. Her case at first appeared obscure, the symptoms not bein
adequate to the apparent disturbance. Dr. H. R. applied to me, and f
discovered a peculiar murmur not mentioned either by Laennec or the
lamented Dr. Hope ; I propose to call it “La Murmure Nominale.”
When her bosom heaved a sigh, I distinctly heard “Henry Corbelle,”
vale-ing from one air passage to another. Upon this hint Dr. Hammer
Roses spoke—the parents adopted his prescription, and I soon afterwards
noticed in the doctor's library hymeneal cards, bearing the names,
“Mr. Henry Corbelle,”—“Mrs. Henry Corbelle.”
An old miserly stock-jobber called one morning upon the Doctor for
advice; he complained of a diminished circulation, and an inability to with-
draw his hands from his pockets—almost amounting to paralysis—and was,
like his late 5 per cents, considerably reduced ; as he appeared to have
been previously percuted, I was applied to his left side, and never heard
a finer specimen of “Metallic tinkling” in my life.
His case was incurable—age increased his disease—and he gave up
the business of this life while purchasing a thousand pounds worth of
stock.
Mem. “Metallic tinkling” can be frequently detected in poor miser-
able unhappy creatures, starving on 5000l. a year.
An unfortunate BEE-ING.
It is a disease of the chest, which attracts no sympathy for the sufferer.
PRIVATE THEATRICALS.
We have been told that Mr. Hume is coming out shortly as othello;
and it is ex d that his ejaculation of “Fool, fool, fool” will be the
most truthlike and natural that has ever been heard within the walls of a
theatre.
Qſo Correspondents.
It is with pleasure we inform our innumerable Correspondents that we
have concluded a contract with an extensive timber-merchant for the en-
largement of “Punch’s” letter-box, in which there will shortly be “ample
room and verge enough" for our daily receipts of epistles, amounting on
the average to—we are afraid to say (for we have not time to count them)
how many communications.
Those of our courteous friends, however, who continually complain
that we neither send them private answers nor return their effusions, are
respectively informed that, as we have not so many secretaries as the
Governor-General of India, it is impossible. Let them, therefore, under-
stand that, when they drop their brain-sauce into “Punch's” knowledge-
box, only one fortune or one fate awaits them—immortality in “Punch's”
columns, or utter oblivion with Johnson and Brice.

PUNCH*S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER W.--THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING “NOTHING.”
In my last, my dear boy, I promised to advise you to the choice of
a profession. I hasten to redeem that promise. Then I say to you,
strive to be neither bishop, chancellor, generalissimo, nor court phy-
sician; but, my beloved child,—be Nothing.
By not trammelling your mind with the subtleties of divinity or
law—by maintaining a perfect freedom from the prejudices of a
military or medical life—you will be able to take a more dispassionate
view of the world about you; will be the more ready to accommodate
yourself to any profitable circumstance that may present itself. Con-
sider how many curates who devote their lives to divinity shiver
in a brown-black coat; fight a daily fight with the meanest necessi-
ties; and with wife, and it may be half-a-dozen children ill-clothed
and ill-fed at home; is paid forty pounds a-year to be a pattern piece
of holiness and benevolence to all the country round. His clerk,
who to his Sunday duties, unites the profitable trade of soleing and
heeling dilapidated shoes, is a nabob to him; the clerk is not cursed
with the brand of a gentleman; he may ply with wax-end and awl—
may vend soap, brick-dust and candles—run of errands, beat carpets,
—do any servile work to make up his income; his Sabbath “Amen”
being in no way vulgarised by the labour of the week. But the
curate—alas, poor man —he has been to college, and is a gentleman.
Thus, by virtue of his gentility, he must be content with beggary, nor
soil his orthodox hands with vulgar task-work. He must be satisfied
with daily bread in its very literalness, nor dare to hope the luxury
of butter. You are not my own flesh and blood, if you would stand
this. -
Next for the law. I should have no objection to your being called
to the bar, as a sort of genteel thing. A wig and gown may often
prove a tolerable bait for recently endowed heiresses. They give you
the nominal standing of a gentleman, under which character you may
make various practical speculations on the innocence of mankind;
but for living upon your business, you might as soon hope to make a
daily dinner on the flag-stones of Pump-court. Consider, my son,
what a thing is a briefless barrister A cockatrice that cannot lay
eggs—a spider, without an inch of web |
I have no vote for any borough or county; and though in my time
I have served multitudes of politicians, votes when in and out of
office, there is not one of them who has the gratitude to own the ob-
ligation. Hence, what will be your fate if you go into the army I
might—with assistance from a few loan societies—be able to purchase
you a pair of colours; but as neither myself nor your mother have
any interest with anybody at the Horse Guards, what would be your
fate, if unhappily alive, at seventy Why, still the pair of colours;
and, if you have served long in India, a face of orange-peel, and a
piece of liver no bigger than your thumb. Glory, my boy, is a beau-
tiful thing in the Battle of Waterloo at Astley's; and there, if you
have military yearnings, take your shilling's-worth of it. -
As for medicine, if you set up in what is called an honourable
manner, to kill by diploma, you will find the game so beaten and
hunted, that 'tis ten to one if you bag a patient once a twelvemonth.
If, indeed, fortified by your own unauthorised opinion, you can pre-
scribe—if by virtue of the stamp-office, the government kindly suf-
fering the utterance of any compound at 1s. 2d. per pot, -you can
persuade people into patent remedies against disease and death,
disarming the destroyer by a learned name attached to bread-pills or
coloured Thames water-take my blessing, and straightway—having
entered into a sleeping partnership with a confidential undertaker—
found a College of Health. There is no such golden walk to Fortune
us through the bowels of the credulous; and when sick, all men are
credulous. Pain is a great leveller, alike hurling down scepticism,
philosophy, and mere prosaic common-sense. The man, who before
his friends will sneer at a vaunted specific, -will sneak out by him-
self to seek the quack vendor of the despised anodyne ; in the same
way, that fine ladies who profess to laugh at astrology, will disguise
themselves in old shawls and bonnets, and venture up dirty lanes and
into foul garrets, to consult bed-ridden fortune-tellers as to the
whereabout and when-coming of their future husbands. If you have
any feelings for medicine, and have face and nerve to cry “Quack”
lustily—away with you into the market-place, and begin. But if,
with the unprofitable pride of science, you would only physic, bleed,
and blister on the strength of a diploma; the boy who carries out
your medicine shall be happier than his master, and—when he gets
his wages—better paid.
Again, then, I say it, my son, be Nothing ! Look at the flourishing
examples of Nothing about you ! Consider the men in this vast me-
tropolis whose faces shine as it were with the very marrow of the
land, and all for doing and being Nothing ! Then, what ease—what
unconcern—what perfect dignity in the profession I Why, dull-
brained, horn-handed labour, sweats and grows thin, and dies con-
sumptive, whilst Nothing gets a redder tinge upon its cheek, a
thicker wattle to its chin, and a larger compass of abdomen. There
are hundreds of the goodly profession of Nothing who have walked
upon three-piled velvet from their nurse's arms to the grave: men,
who in the most triumphant manner vindicate the ingenuity of the
human mind; for enjoying and possessing every creature comfort of
existence, not even a conjuror, nay, sometimes not even a police
magistrate, can discover how they get it.
Consider man as Nothing, and what a glorious spectacle. A man
following an allowed, a known profession, is a vulgar object, let his
incomings be ever so great : we know his whole mystery—we can tell
whence flows his tide of wealth. The Thames is a gorgeous river, but
knowing its name, we talk little of its magnificence. 'Tis otherwise
with the Niger. The man who with nothing, has all things, is to us
a sort of Friar Bacon. We approach him with a feeling deeper than
respect. He is the Cornelius Agrippa of our times. We know not
but some familiar spirit does not act his bidding. He may, on the
contrary, be a king's son by a left-handed marriage. He moves in
a cloud of mystery—he is away, apart from the commerce. We
know, that if other men were to cease from their ordinary occu-
pations, the whole train of human wants would immediately set in
upon them; yet the man professing Nothing lives, independent,
tabooed, from all the activities of life. Oh, my son I grant the secret
may be difficult to compass; but study for it—search it out, though
your brain become dry and rattle in your skull like a withered hazel-
nut—still, once discover how to live with Nothing, and you may snap
your fingers at all mortal accident. Nothing, when a successful
Nothing, is the nabob of the world !
You will, in your progress through life, be called upon to wonder at
the discoveries of GALILEo, who swore that the world moved round
the sun—and then, or I mistake, that the sun moved round the world;
you will hear a great deal of Homer and Shakspere, who shaped out
worlds upon paper, and begot men and women with drops of ink;
folks will talk to you upon the discovery of the circulation of the
blood; and other gossips of the like sort, demanding your admiration,
your homage, for what they will call the triumph of human genius.
Fiddle-de-deel What should you care how the world moves, or
whether it move at all so you move well in it ! As for Homer and
Shakspere, the first was a beggar, and for the second—for the great
magician, who, as people will cant to you, has left immortal company
for the spirit of man in its weary journey through this briary world—
has bequeathed pills of immortal loveliness for the human fancy to
delight in—founts of eternal truth for the lip of man to drink—and
drink—and for aye be renovated with every draught—he, this bene-
factor to the world, could not secure a comfortable roof from the
affections and gratitude of men, for the female descendant of his flesh,
who withered from the world, almost an outcast and a pauper? Now,
the man who can live a long and jovial life upon Nothing, has often
(by some strange wizard craft) the wherewithal to bequeath to his
heirs. As for literature and science—tales of fairy-land, and the cir-

THE QUEEN'S SPEECH.
WE are indebted to Sir Rob ERT PEEL–and whatever be his
faults as a statesman, let it be known to his lasting honour as a man
of taste, that he is a devout admirer of Punch—for the following
early and exclusive copy of (what was to have been) the Minister's
valedictory oration to Parliament—an oration, by a political fiction,
received as the Queen's Speech:—
“My Lords and Gentlemen,
“It gives me considerable satisfaction to close the present session
of Parliament. As from the first the country expected no benefit
whatever from your deliberative wisdom, so have you in no manner
deceived the hopes of the nation.
“There is, I believe, considerable distress in the manufacturing
districts; nevertheless, it will be cheering for you to learn that all
advices from the moors speak of grouse as being most abundant.
This fact will, I trust, console you for the long and wearying anxie-
ties of this most eventful session.
“Whilst, as faithful guardians of the interests of the people, the
present aspect of events may fill you with apprehensions for the
consequences of the coming winter, it will be no small consolation
for you to know that partridges are strong, and very numerous. It
pains me to hear that several of my faithful subjects have died for
want of food. With regard to partridges, in many places eighteen
have been seen in one covey.
“It is not expected that the importation of foreign cattle will
materially reduce the price of butcher's meat; but I have received
advices from the most influential poulterers at the West-end, that
pheasants promise to be very reasonable.
“I cannot close this session without congratulating you, my Lords
and Gentlemen, that steamboats start every other day for Scotland,
by means of which sportsmen from both Houses “may be conveyed
within twenty miles of the Highlands.” There is, besides, a ‘clipper
schooner, for political economists.
“It is also a matter of congratulation, that the ingenuity of our
manufacturers has been displayed in the production of a peculiar
web, which will be found of the highest national service when worked
into shooting-jackets for Members of Parliament. The like ingenuity
has been most triumphantly displayed in a material for gaiters, for
the protection of which it has pleased us, in council, to issue letters-
patent.
“You will now, my Lords and Gentlemen, retire for a while from
your legislative labours, taking with you into the country the con-
solations of the patriotic, and shot of every number.
“My Lords and Gentlemen, I hope much from this temporary
cessation of your combined labours. In the solitude of the country,
you will still think of your country's good. When treading the
stubble, you will ponder on the effects of the Corn Laws; nor will
the thought of the labourer's leg of mutton be absent from your mind
whilst brushing away the heavy dew from his turnips.
“My Lords and Gentlemen,
“When we next meet, I trust you will be prepared to give your
improved, and most dispassionate, opinion on the remedies required
by the condition of the country, and, more especially, your un-
influenced and solemn notions on the efficacy and social utility of—

Yes, indeed, I intend to be married 1
I want to be “settled in life,”
Too long l've a bachelor tarried,
And am now looking out for a wife f
I am still a gay fellow-worth hooking—
My age is but just thirty-two—
So, girls, if for husbands you're looking,
Pray keep this announcement in view.
II.
On fat Lady Fussy I squander'd
The summer-day hours of my life;
Whilst others from flame to flame wander'd,
I ogled the City knight's wife.
I hoped—for the net was well baited—
When a widow, her tears I should dry ;
But the chances I much over-rated,
For tough old Sir John wouldn't die.
iii. *
• Well ! then I proposed for his daughter,
The pretty, the witty, the belle
Of the City Court-end, but with laughter
She dismiss'd my addresses péle méle.
But though at my offer she flouted,
And affected my suit to despise,
Of this fact I have never yet doubted,
She'd be glad of me yet—ere she dies.
IV.
N'importe! there are plenty of others
I am sure I can get if I try :
There's Miss Brown (but she's so many brothers),
Miss Bell, and sweet little Miss Bligh:
And Miss Higgins, the rich grocer's daughter,
Clara Horton, and, lastly, Miss Rowe–
Whom I rowed up to Richmond by water—
They'd each of them have me, I know.
V.
I care not too much for the graces
Of figure, or features, or mind,
In the bride whom I wed—so some traces
Of true kindred spirit I find.
I seek not for rank, or for fashion,
But the girl I should cherish most dear
For me, must have plenty of “passion,”
And—five or six hundred a year !
wi.
Should this meet the eye of some fair one
Who the columns of “Punch " may peruse,
She may now have the chance—'tis a rare one—
Of a husband instanter to choose :
For, “pon honour,” I’m going to marry,
And am very “hard up "for a wife;
I cannot spare time long to tarry,
As I want to get “settled in life.”

THE LIGHT FOR ALL NATIONS.
WE feel ourselves called upon to apologise to the Caisson for a
statement contained in our Number of last week, when, taking the
Observer as an authority, we announced the fact that the much-libelled
machine had burst.
We find, however, from a statement dated “Caisson, August the
4th,” that the pumps are still at work. The refreshing fact is also
announced that the Caisson is soon expected to reach a chalky
stratum. This entirely negatives the ill-natured rumour that it had
“walked its” chalks altogether.
It is true, says Mr. Bush, who signs himself “C. E.” (which means
ExPLAINING his wiews.
probably cheerful enthusiast), that “two of the outer plates were
cracked in the gale of Friday,” but the Caisson people appear to
think nothing of being cracked, and speak of such an event as a
trifle hardly worth speaking of. -
He is “happy to add” that “the entire apparatus is as immoveable as
when it was upon the beach;” which means that the whole concernis
utterly untractable. The idea of being “happy to add” such a state:
ment as this, reminds us of the invalid who “enjoyed the most wretched
state of health.” But anything coming from the caisson ought not to
excite astonishment. The excavation of the sand goes on rapidly at
low tide, but the hole made during the ebb is filled up swimmingly at
the flow; and the workmen are playing a game with Neptune, in
which he of the trident invariably gets the best of it.
MENTAL science.
NEW AND IMPORTANT DISCOVERY :
“Mr. Punch" begs to inform his numerous readers, that he has
invented a new system of artificial memory, to be called “Mnemonics
for the Many,”—the only thing, almost, except food and clothing,
which the said Many are in want of. -
The principle on which his system is based is that of associating
facts with sensations. Inasmuch as every blockhead has nerves of
feeling, its applicability will obviously be universal, “Mr. P.” trusts,
therefore, that he has not christened it presumptuously.
The following illustrations will sufficiently explain its nature:-
Suppose the fact to be impressed on the mind to be, that the Alex-
andrian library was burnt B.C. 47. Let the student, in the act of
committing it to memory, thrust a large needle, as far as he can, into
any convenient part of his person.
“Gunpowder treason,” the boys sing on the 5th of November,
“shall never be forgot.” To make sure of that, let him, as he learns
that it was detected on the day above-mentioned, A.D. 1605, cause a
poker, heated to redness, to be applied to the same region.
Should the piece of chronology to be remembered be, that the
French Bastile was captured by the mob, July 14, 1789; or that, on
such and such a day, in such and such a parish, the foundation stone
of an English one was laid, by such and such a Churchwarden, assisted
by so and so, the Beadle;—apply a blister behind one of the ears.
You are charged to deliver a message to a friend in case of meeting
him. Put a few sharp pebbles in your boots before you pull them on.
Your wife desires you to call at the milliner's, and request that
her pélerine may be sent home directly. Run a small splinter under-
neath your nail, and let it remain there till you have fulfilled your
Commission.
You continually forget to wind up your watch of a morning. Soak
your tooth-brush, over-night, in decoction of aloes. -
You have to pay money into your bank in the city, and other busi-
ness, which is likely to escape your recollection, to transact in the
neighbourhood. Put an open penknife into your pocket, in such a
way that you may be sure to run your hand against the point of it
in going to take your cash out.
You are to look in at the doctor's on your way, and desire him to
come and see your child, which has something the matter with it.
Button a few stinging-nettles up in your breeches next the skin. Or
rub a little cowhage between your fingers—or deposit a grain of dust
in your eye—or stick a wafer on the end of your nose.
Stiff serrated collars, tight waistcoats, and all other uncomfortable
items of dress, may be made to furnish memorandums. For this
purpose, also, Mr. Punch would recommend a hair shirt as “a valu-
able article.”
But why, it may be asked, not have recourse to sensations of the
pleasing class : Because these are few and evanescent. The paths
of learning must be strewed with thorns—not flowers.
Mr. Punch takes no great credit to himself for this discovery; but
he would just observe that, like that of gravitation, it was the result
of accident. The circumstance too that led to it was similar. The
fall of an apple to the ground gave rise to Newton's idea; the fall of
a cudgel on his head occasioned that of Punch. He thinks, by the
by, that the sage who was killed by an oyster dropped on his pate by
a crow, would, had the said oyster not made rather too strong an im-
pression, have been beforehand with Sir Isaac ; at least, that he
ought to have been so.
What would have set some people crying, set Mr. Punch thinking.
He thought, what was also, in part, a matter of personal experience,
—how great is the efficacy, as a remedy for a short memory, in the
case of the youthful student, of the argumentum ad clunes, otherwise
called the argumentum a posteriori physicum seu corporeum. He recollected
likewise the advice so often given to learners, to take pains. From
these and similar facts he deduced his system.
He does not promulgate it rashly, and without having duly tested
it. On the contrary, he has taken care to verify it by experiment
He keeps a tiger, who used continually to forget to shut the door
behind him. Having over and over again reminded him, verbally, of
this omission, to no purpose, he at length accompanied his remon-
strance, one day, by an energetic appeal to the quarter above alluded
to, in the shape of a certain impulsive application thereunto of the
anterior extremity of the right foot. The act of neglect was never
afterwards repeated.
AniMAL MAGNETISM.
Other experiments in point, too numerous to mention, he also
tried; some of them at great personal hazard. For instance, pulling,
on one occasion, in illustration of his system, an irascible gentleman's
nose, he was suddenly stretched, with his own flattened like the ace of
hearts, on the floor.
His invention is not only applicable to the human race, but even to
the lower animals; and he is certain that from it the Gne Atest Ass
is capable of deriving benefit.
Mr. Punch hopes that his liberality in thus unreservedly making
his discovery known, instead of trying, as some people would, to sell
it, will be properly appreciated, and that he will be ranked with the
other eminent benefactors of the “Many ” who adorn the present
day.
N.B. The proposed plan is especially recommended to the singing
classes at Exeter Hall.
RUMOURED CHANGES.
Bloomsbury BILL has accepted the office of Waterman to the Cab
Stand at Charing Cross. The emoluments are between ten and twelve
shillings a week, but he gives up a large private practice as a holder of
horses at the Clubs in Pall Mall.
It is expected that Dashaway Dick will be unseated as driver of the
Red Rover omnibus, and it is said that he will accept the Kensington
Twos, by entering the service of Mr. Cloud as a pair-horse coachman.
It is whispered that policeman K. 46 is about to resign his position in
the force, on account of a difference of opinion between himself and the
present Government on a merely financial question. We have heard
that he has an ofter of more lucrative employment in another quarter.

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON IDLER.
CHAPTER v III.--OF THE MOON.E.R.
FTER a diligent search
in Johnson's Dictionary,
to which authority we ge-
nerally rush for informa-
tion concerning any word,
we find no other meaning
given to “moon,” than its
ordinary astronomical sig-
nification. We must there-
fore coin our own epithet,
and define the subject of
our present chapter, as
an individual who moons
about, without any object,
half absent, half contem-
plative; and differing from
the majority of loungers
we have already portray-
ed, in being neither young,
nor over-particular in his
toilette. He is most pro-
bably an old bachelor,
with a hundred and fifty
pounds a year.
In zoological classifica-
tion, the Mooner evidently
belongs to the Ruminantia.
He lounges and strays
about, taking four times
the period usually allotted
- to walk any distance, fid-
dle-faddling the space of time away in a lamentably unprofitable
manner, and finding intense amusement in objects which the Regent-
street Idler, or even the Gent, would pass by in contempt. The
laying-down of wooden blocks, to form a new pavement, detains him
a sure half-hour. The opening of a water-main, or a course of gas-
pipes, is another riveting spectacle ; but the attraction of both these
is exceeded by the elevation of a fresh block of stone to the top of
an embryo building—which is a process of so absorbing a nature,
as to make him unmindful of everything else in the world, until it
is properly fixed. It is lucky for him that the view of the river has
been shut out on the Palace-side of Westminster-bridge, or his head
would certainly grow between the balustrades, whilst he watched the
laying of each successive piece of masonry, hereafter to form the
New Houses of Parliament.
The Mooner, like other Idlers, is exceedingly fond of the shops—
more especially those where some mechanical performance is going
on in the windows. In this respect a cork-cutter's ranks very high ;
he wonders what the men do with the bits they take off, and how it
is they never slice their fingers. He also admires the gratuitous
exhibition in natural philosophy afforded by the working of the
coffee-shop steam-engine in Rathbone-place, and thinks what a quan-
tity of coffee the people in the neighbourhood must get through, if
the mill is obliged to work all day to grind it for them. He is also
much gratified at the table-knives and teapots revolving on a bottle-
jack in the windows of the cheap ironmongers; which attractive
display is only exceeded in interest by a gold-beater's or a paper-
stainer's, where the arcana of those trades are displayed to the
passers by.
If the Mooner patronises other shop-windows, they are never the
usually frequented ones. He cultivates cheap literature at the
second-hand book stalls; or otherwise stops at that uninteresting
class of shops which only gain our attention when we are loitering
about for a coach to arrive or start. Indeed, the Mooner, in his
common appearance, has the air of a person perpetually waiting for
the chimerical omnibus of an imaginary railroad which never
arrives. We have, however, no right to find fault with his occupa-
tions—or, rather, his perfect want of any—for every man has the
privilege of amusing himself in the manner most congenial to his
own feelings; but we must object to entering into any conversation
with the Mooner. He possesses that diverting property, which some
people appear to cultivate with such care, of totally losing the point
of any anecdote he relates; and strolls and wanders just as much in
his conversation as he does in his peregrinations, lingering as long on
the way as a Charing-Cross omnibus.
If you meet him, you cannot mention a word but it puts him in
mind of a story that has no connexion at all with the subject in
question; but there appears to exist an imaginary link in his brain,
and you had better see a friend on the other side of the street,
“whom you wish to speak to,” or suffer, and be silent until he has
concluded.
If it should happen that the Mooner has to go from Piccadilly to
Lincoln’s-inn Fields, the journey lasts an entire afternoon, so many
reasons for delay does he find upon the road. Having seen some
-
=
*--
-
—e-
coaches start from the Regent Circus, read the directions upon the
boxes, whenever it was practicable, and refused to buy a pen-knife
with fourteen blades, he casts a side-long glance up Windmill-street,
towards the morning figure at the wax-work establishment, and then
saunters on to Leicester Square, where he remains for a very indefi-
nite period, lost in wonder at the various objects in that bustling
thoroughfare. He watches the man making wire toasting-forks and
pipe-stoppers, until he is almost competent to undertake the manu:
facture himself, and then gazes for some time at the little mechanical
man on horseback, who rides so gallantly across three panes of the
window next to Miss Linwood's Exhibition once in every two minutes
and a quarter. From this he turns to a vendor of the class of seedy-
respectables, arrayed from top to toe in rusty black, and carrying an
inverted saucepan-lid full of small medals, which he expresses his
reasons for parting with by the following address:– - --
“Now, you have the last opportunity of becoming rich, and deciding
the celebrated wager, of which you have read so much in “Bell's
Life in London,” laid at Sir Robert Peel's grand dinner, between
Prince Esterhazy and Mr. Feargus O'Connor, as to whether it was
possible to dispose of five hundred full-weight sovereigns at one penny
each before six o'clock this evening. It's against the law of the land
to sell gold so cheap, therefore I let you have the case for a penny,
containing two bodkins and a darning-needle, and give you the sºve-
reign in, together with this new and favourite ballad, a gold wedding-
ring, a five-pound note, and a pith tumbler. Now, who's the lucky
buyer of the last half-dozen.” -
After this oration, and when he has listened to an organ playing
Ma Normandie, he loiters on a little further to a stall where a man is
joining cracked pieces of plate, and making pennies look like crown-
pieces; and having expressed his approbation at the process, he after:
wards enters with vivid interest into the speech of a vendor of small
Napoleons shut up in glass bottles, and once again loses himself for
twenty minutes in a searching chain of inquiry as to the probable
mode of accomplishing this apparently impossible piece of ingenuity.
He then moves forward again to the door of the Panorama, and for

the hundredth time reads over the names of the two views, and won-
ders which is the more attractive, Cabul, or the Battle of Waterloo.
At Cranbourn Alley, new sources of delay arise. He gazes at the
straw bonnets until the young women in the dingy cloaks, who stand
with such unflinching pertinacity at the doors of the shops, commence
thinking that he is about to become a purchaser on a large scale—
perhaps for an emigration colony, who knows?—and directly rush up
and overwhelm him with such voluble panegyrics on their wares,
that he is compelled to seek refuge in flight by crossing Castle-street
and plunging into that paradise of fourteen-shilling Wellington boots,
small-tooth combs, pastrycooks, outfitting warehouses (each with so
large a stock that they have taken two or three years to sell it off,
even at a tremendous sacrifice), umbrellas, Berlin wool, and travelling
trunks, which connects the last-named thoroughfare with St. Martin's
Lane.
And having brought him thus far, we will leave him, lost in wonder
at a railway carpet-bag or an expanding portmanteau, until next
week; when we shall, in all probability, find him at the same place,
and continue our journey with him as before.
THE NATURAL HISTORY OF COURTSHIP.
CHAPTER VII.-OF THE MEN who ARE Always Accept ED.
IN England men are the active members of society, women the
passive ones. Amidst the aristocracy and affluenced, it is considered
somewhat of a disgrace for a young man to have nothing to do; and
if he have no talents for the bar or for the pulpit—if he cannot
muster enough capacity for electioneering, or to fill a situation in the
Treasury, he either turns author, or spends his time in dangling after
the fair sex, and in making love. So that, for once, Bulwer was
right, when he said, “With us, women associate with the idler por-
tion of society—the dandies, the hangers-on.” These are the animals
who, in the natural history of society, come under the genus “Ladies'
men;” but we, who are envious of their successes, and would give
our brains for half the favour Beauty bestows upon them, call them
* Coxcombs.”
“Sit not in the midst of women,” is by no means their motto. They
are seen at fancy bazaars, fetes champétres, and morning concerts; they
loll in carriages, and lounge in opera boxes; they leave the dinner-
table with the ladies, being amateurs in embroidery, and talk in
“lisping numbers” of Cerito and the poetry of motion. Their so-called
devotion to the sex is equal in amount to that of the ancient chivalry,
but it is of a different character. They are knights dubbed upon
“carpet consideration,” whose achievements are all performed in
the drawing-room or the boudoir. Their sole occupation is—
“To pick up gloves, and pins, and knitting needles;
To list to songs and tunes;—to watch for smiles,
And smile at pretty prattle, and look into
The eyes of feminine, as though they were
The stars receding to our early wish.”
This is the most prominent class of men who are always accepted—
perhaps the women pity them; and we know what pity is akin to. But
certain it is, that whenever these butterflies will condescend to flutter
around one flower—if he will only choose a bright particular star to
pay his devotions to—he triumphs, whilst better men despair.
This is the whole secret. Let ever so perfect a ladies' man beware
of becoming too popular! Let him beware of distributing his favours
too lavishly Let him once banish, by a too general attention to all,
the hope which each cherishes that she is the real object of his de-
votion, and he is lost l—he must get into another set immediately.
But when he adroitly chooses the right time for making his selection,
the selected, knowing the chances he possesses with her friends, will
surely not refuse him, nor deny herself the triumph of an envied
conquest. But when it is once doubted by each of the ladies to
| whom he is so useful, so attentive, so self-sacrificing, that all his
“nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles” are directed specially to
herself, they go for nothing—they are valueless. Even his chances of
success are lost.
Thus it is that men who are popular in society are seldom agree-
able to a feminine unit. She is afraid that the devotion and attention
which ought to belong exclusively to her will be too liberally be-
stowed upon her friends. Hence there is one character most fre-
quently met with whose success is certain. The reserved, retiring,
generally unnoticed individual,—he it is upon whose disposition, and
character, and heart, she loves to speculate—to invest him with
the highest attributes of intellect and the deepest throes of feeling.
* The “carpet knight” was the satirical designation of the civil knight, to dis-
tinguish him from those who gained the honour by deeds of arms.
What a thrilling, marked compliment is conveyed if he who has not
addressed, scarcely looked at any other girl, speaks to her, even if it
be merely to complain of the heat. But, oh! should he appear to be
the victim of some secret sorrow, some soul-absorbing grief—should
he, though dressed according to the latest fashion, express a disgust
at the gew-gaws of the world—should he, who is seen at every
assembly he can get into, sigh for solitude, and so present to the
fancy of his fair listener the picture of a drawing-room Diogenes–
she is enraptured. Few imaginations can withstand such a combina-
tion of elegance and misanthropy, or philosophy so tastefully attired.
Such men are never rejected.
Lastly—courteous student of the arts of courtship, would you con-
vert your chances of success into certainty—would you outstrip all
competitors—be rich
“Heretic "exclaims my excellent Priscilla, bristling with anger,
“have we no discrimination—no disinterestedness? Are we devoid of
sensibility? Have we no hearts **
“By no means, champion of your sex. You have all these.
You forget: I am not inditing about love. You wander from the
subject, which, please always remember, is the making of love;—
the manufacture of that counterfeit feeling which is so often mis-
taken for the true one.”
SONGS OF THE FLOWERS.
No. I.- THE SONG OF THE DAISY.
I'm a delicate daisy, and all the day long,
When the bee from his hive to the garden takes wing,
I watch him intently, and list to the song
That a bee, when 'tis jocund, will cheerfully sing.
Oh! what is "t to me that the daffydowndilly
Is fairer, and taller, and sweeter than I?
To envy the great would be idle and silly,
A daisy I’ve lived, and a daisy I'll die.
In the morning, when Phoebus is tinging with gold
The tops of the trees, and of chimneys the pots,
To drink in the dew all my buds I unfold,
For of dew the young daisies are regular sots.
What though of the garden I am not the pride?
For gaudier flowers though coldly pass'd by,
ln my humble condition I'd rather abide—
Yes! a daisy I'vo lived, and a daisy I'll die.
They soll me for little; the fact I must own-
A penny is all they demand for a root–
And often I perish before I’m full blown,
When stifled with London's unbearable soot.
No matter! I'd rather the window adorn
Of a snug little parlour that's next to the sky,
Than in the bouquet of a cold one be worn,
Who'd leave the too-delicate daisy to die.

LITERARY INTELLIGENCE.
Wr understand that Mr. Shillibeer has placed one of his funeral con-
veyances at the disposal of a well-known dramatist, whose rooms, from
the accumulation of deceased melodrames, had become inconveniently
crowded. The unfortunate defunct are to be interred either at Harrow,
in accordance with their frightful character, or at Nunhead, as being
more appropriate to the peculiar position of their author.
Mr. Pennyline started one morning last week to Bayswater, on a tour
of observation, to watch the progress of the new buildings, and remark on
the occurrence of any accident among the men engaged on them. He
had the good fortune to witness the precipitation of a brieklayer's labourer
from the top of a ladder, when he immediately made the melancholy cir-
cumstance the subject of a very vigorous and impressive paragraph.
Mr. Sillyboy, the popular author of the charming ballad “ Brush
back that Briny Tear,” has another song on the same subject nearly
ready. It commences with “Wipe off that pearly drop,” and is said to
be in many respects equal to its predecessor. It is, we believe, intended
for publication, but it is doubtful whether the gifted author will carry out
his intention so far as to publish it.
The new novel of the Crusaders of Clapham is said to be in the press;
but we believe the fact to be, that the only press it is in is the author's
large cupboard, where it is likely to continue.
#. neat little romance of Knightsbridge as it is—Brompton as it
was—and Fulham as it ought to be, is still in the hands of a celebrated
bibliopole, who has promised an early perusal, with a view to an arrange-
ment for its speedy publication, if the incidents are not considered rather
too powerful for the present quiet taste which regulates book-reading. One
chapter, in which Fulham is compared to Elysium, and the #. of Time
is represented as walking arm in arm with the shadow of Eternity in the
enclosure of Brompton-square, is said to be one of the most powerful pieces
of fiction that was ever written.
MISS TICKLETOBY'S LECTURES ON
ENGLISH HISTORY.
LECTURE. W.-WILLIAM RUFU.S.
UST before the breath was out of
the Conqueror's body, William Ru-
fus, his second son (who had much
longer legs than his honest elder
brother Robert), ran over to Eng-
land, took possession of some castles
and his father's money, and, so forti-
fied, had himself proclaimed King
of England without any difficulty.
Houest Robert remained Duke of
Normandy; and as for the third
son, Prince Henry, though not so
handsomely provided for as his el-
der brothers, it appears he managed
to make both ends meet by robbing
on his own account.
William's conduct on getting hold
of the crown was so violent, that some of the nobles whom he plun-
dered were struck with remorse at having acknowledged him king
instead of honest Courthose, his elder brother. So they set up a sort
of rebellion, which Rufus quelled pretty easily, appealing to the
people to support him, and promising them ali sorts of good treat-
ment in return. The people believed him, fought for him, and when
they had done what he wanted, namely, quelled the rebellion, and
aided him in seizing hold of several of Robert's Norman castles and
towns—would you believe it —William treated them not one bit
better than before 1 (Cries of Shame).
At these exclamations Miss Tickletoby looked round very sternly.
Young people, young people (exclaimed she), I’m astonished at you.
Don't you know that such cries on your part are highly improper and
Beditious ! Don't you know that by crying out “Shame” in that way,
you insult not only every monarch, but every ministry that ever
oxisted Shame indeed Shame on you, for daring to insult our late
excellent Whig Ministry, our present admirable Conservative Cabinet,
Sir Robert, Lord John, and all, every minister that ever governed
| us. They all promise to better us, they all never do so. Learn
respect for your betters, young people, and do not break out into such
premature rebellion. (The children being silent, Miss T. put on a
less severe countenance and continued)—
I will tell you a pleasant joke of that wag, his late Majesty King
William Rufus. He put the kingdom into a great fury against the
Normans, saying I have no doubt that they were our natural enemies,
and called a huge army together, with which, he said, he would go
and annihilate them. The army was obliged to assemble, for by the
laws of the country each nobleman, knight, thane, and landholder,
was bound according to the value of his land to furnish so many-
soldiers, knowing that the king would come down on their estates
else; and so being all come together, and ready to cross the water,
the king made them a speech.
“Friends, Countrymen, and Fellow Soldiers (said he); companions
of my toil, my feelings, and my fame; the eyes of Europe are upon
you. You are about to embark on a most dangerous enterprise; you
will have to undergo the horrors of a sea-voyage, of which I need
not describe to you the discomforts (the army began to look very
blue). You will be landed in a hostile country, which has been laid
waste by me already in my first invasions, as also by the accursed
policy of the despot who governs it. (Cries of Down with Robert Short-
loset No tyranny! no Normans 1) In this afflicted naked country the
greater part of you will inevitably starve; a considerable number
will be cut to pieces by the ferocious Norman soldiery, and even if
it please Heaven to crown my first cause with success, what will my
triumph benefit you, my friends? You will be none the better for it;
but will come back many of you without your arms and legs, and
not a penny richer than when you went. (Immense sensation.)
“Now, I appeal to you as men, as Englishmen, as fathers of families,
will it not be better to make a peaceful and honourable compromise
than to enter upon any such campaign : Yes! I knew you would
say yes, as becomes men of sense, men of honour—Englishmen, in a
word. (Hear, hear.) I ask you, then—your sovereign and father asks
you—will it not be better to pay me ten shillings a-piece all round,
and go home to your happy families—to your lovely wives, who will
thus run no risk of losing the partners of their beds—to smiling
children, who may still for many, many years have their fathers to
bless, maintain, and educate them Officers, carry the hats round,
and take the sense of the army.”
Putting his handkerchief to his eyes, the beneficent monarch here
sat down : and what was the consequence of his affecting appeal Thé
hats were sent round—the whole army saw the propriety of sub-
scribing—fifteen thousand pounds were paid down on the spot—a
bloody war was avoided—and thus, as the king said, all parties were
benefited.
For all this, however, he was not long before he had them out again,
and took agreatnumber of histowns and castles from his brother Robert.
At last he got possession of his whole dukedom ; for at this time all
Europe was seized with a strange fit of frenzy, and hatred against
the Turks; one Peter, a hermit, went abroad preaching hatred against
these unbelievers, and the necessity of taking Palestine from them, and
murdering every mother's son of them. No less than a million of men
set off on this errand. Three hundred thousand of them marched ahead,
without food or forethought, expecting that Heaven would provide
them with nourishment on their march, and give them the victory
over the Saracens. But this pious body was cut to pieces; and as for
the doings of the other seven hundred thousand, what heroes com-
manded them, what dangers they overcame, what enchanters they
destroyed, how they took the holy city, and what came of their con-
quest—all this may be read in the veracious history of one Tasso,
but has nothing to do with the history of William Rufus. -
That shrewd monarch would not allow his islanders to meddle
with the business; but his brother, honest Robert, quite sick of fight-
ing, drinking, and governing in his own country, longed to go to
Palestine, and having no money (as usual), William gave him a sum
for which the other handed over his inheritance to him ; and so
Robert was got rid of, and William became King of England and
Duke of Normandy.
But he did not keep his kingdoms long. There is a tract of land
called the New Forest in Hampshire which has been called so ever
since the Conqueror's time. Once it was a thriving district covered
with farms and villages and churches, with many people living in it.
But conquering King William had a fancy to have a hunting-ground
there. Churches and villages he burned down; orchards and corn-
fields he laid waste; men, women, and children, he drove pitilessly
away, and gave up the land to boar and deer. So the people
starved and died, and he had his hunting-ground. And such a keen
sportsman was he, and so tender and humane towards the dumb
animals, that he gave orders, if any man killed a boar, a deer, or
even a hare, he should be killed, or have his eyes put out. Up to
a late period, our country enjoyed many of the blessings of that noble
code of laws.
His Majesty King William Rufus loved sport as well as his royal
father, and this New Forest above all. There were all sorts of le-

º-
gends concerning it. The people said (but this was, no doubt, from
their superstitious hatred of his Majesty's person and race) that, on
account of the crimes the Conqueror had committed in the spot, it
was destined to be fatal to his family. One of Rufus's brothers,
and his nephew, were actually killed while hunting there;
and one morning in the year 1100, when his Majesty was going out
hunting, a monk came and prophesied death to him, and warned him
to stay at home.
But the scent was lying well on the ground; the King ordered the
prophet a purse of money, and rode off with his dogs.
He was found dead in the wood, with an arrow in his breast;
and nobody knows who shot it : and what's more, my loves, I fear
nobody cares. A Frenchman by the name of Tyrrell was supposed
to have done the deed; but Tyrrell denied the charge altogether.
His Royal Highness Prince Henry was hunting with the king when
the accident took place, and as poor Robert Shorthose was away
fighting the Turks, Prince Henry slipped into his brother's shoes,
and ruled over the land of England.
Talking about shoes, a dreadful religious disturbance occurred in
England apropos de bottes. It was the fashion to wear these with
immense long toes; and the priests, who could pardon all sorts of
crimes, wouldn't pardon the long-toed boots. You laugh It is a
fact, upon my word'; and what is more, these popes and priests,
who could set up kings and pull them down, and send off millions of
people to fight in crusades, never were strong enough to overcome
the long-toed boots. The Fashion was stronger than the Pope; and
long toes continued to flourish in spite of his curses, and never
yielded a single inch until—until Squarr-toes came in.

THE PROROGATION OF PARLIAMENT.
THE session is at length over, and we are happy to be enabled to give
the following statistical information regarding the events by which the
first session of Conservative rule has been distinguished. The house has
sat upwards of one hundred days, and has soiled in the same period nearly
seven hundred white waistcoats.
Out of more than a thousand speeches, about one half have sent their
hearers to sleep ; and of two hundred orators, two have been pulled down
by their friends, to prevent their continuing to make fools of themselves.
There have been nearly thirty thousand “cheers,” and the word
“hear” has been repeated so often, that statistical vigilance has been
unable to keep pace with it. Of miscellaneous noises, there have been
six, the two principal of which are crowing like a cock, and braying like
an ass; the latter having been the more natural.
Of the Reports of Committees the number has been large, and the
result in waste paper very considerable. Of legislative improvements,
two have been partially effected, and twenty-six have been talked about.
There have been, on an average, a thousand white neckcloths, four
hundred satin scarfs, sixteen stocks at four-and-six, and one (Mr. Hume's)
at two-and-three in mohair. The majority of the Members have worn
.." boots ; but six have been detected in Clarences, and one in
xonlans,

.—PEER LEss Pond. UncLE TRussell’s INTER-
view with HIs NEPHEw.
UNcLE TRUssell, although he could not but approve of Ran-
dulph's behaviour respecting his quarrel with Sir Norfolk Salus-
bury, nevertheless felt some slight qualms as to the manner in which
his mother would receive him on her arrival. But as Randolph's
wound was pronounced unimportant, he appointed to meet him at
Peerless Pond—a place of general resort at this period—and there
talk the matter over.
Peerless Pond, whither Trussell now bent his steps, was a piece of
water, nearly on the site of the present bath, three hundred and
ninety feet long, ninety-three feet broad, and eleven feet deep,
stocked with carp, tench, and a great variety of the finny tribe,
wherein subscribers had the privilege to angle. On each side
was a high slope or bank, with numbers of verdant trees, terminated
at the top by a gravel walk between stately limes; and at the head
of the fishpond, westward, stood a handsome old country squire-like
building, which looked on the water, and wherein all sorts of luxuries
were dispensed to the guests.
As it was not improbable that he might fall in with Lady Brabazon
and Clementina, Trussell, at all times particular, had paid a little
extra attention to his toilet. He had put on a fine flowing Ramillies
periwig, of a light blue tint, together with a yellow velvet coat, a
flowered green satin vest worked with gold thread, scarlet silk
breeches, and ruffles of exquisite texture. A cravat of point lace,
dyed orange, was round his neck. In his hand he carried a clouded
cane with a tassel of faded bell-pull. In his shoes were buckles of
different-coloured paste; and his hose were of the hue known at that
day as dandy-grey-russet. A silver-hilted sword, inlaid with gold, in
a sheath of leather bound with brass and studded with steel, hung at
his side; and a three-cornered hat, edged with feathers of various
hues, completed his attire. -
On arriving at Peerless Pond, he entered the house, and was sorry
to see Jacob Post in conference with Randulph. They were seated
at a table on which was spread a very excellent repast. There was
a magnificent pasty of goat's-eyes—then esteemed a great rarity,
and some cutlets of mutton from Highgate Downs, served with
piquant sauce. A cold heron, which had been roasted whole, was
placed near these dishes, and flanked by a large flagon of St. Luke's
ale, to which Jacob paid frequent devoirs. Pieces of brown bread
were placed before each guest, and salt-cellars at the corners of the
table. On the sideboard was a fricasee of Italian greyhound, and
a dish of potted owl, as well as a salad of rose-leaves and native
oysters.
“I wished you to have come alone, Randulph,” remarked Trussell,
as he entered the room; “you have acted wrong in bringing any one
with you.”
“No, he hasn't,” said Jacob, gruffly. “Tell me why.”
“For reasons best known to myself.” replied Trussell.
“It was by chance he met me here, uncle,” observed Randulph.
“No, it wasn’t,” cried the straightforward Jacob.
During this brief conversation, Randulph's mind was perfectly
occupied with Hilda Scarve. It was evident that he had several
powers working against him. Lady Brabazon was enraged at his
slighting her; so was Clementina. Philip Frewin owed him no
small grudge, and Sir Norfolk was also hostile. Uncle Abel began
to mistrust his actions, and Old Scarve had a decided objection to
him ; whilst Hilda's faith was perhaps shaken by the recollection of
Kitty Conway. Cordwell Firebras merely used him as a tool. Beau
Williers was jealous of his figure ; and even Mr. Crackenthorpe
Cripps eyed him with disdain. He had evidently got no friends.
He consequently waited to see what speech his Uncle would make.

AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY.
ITTLE doubt is there that this fine
science will eventually take the lead
of all others, and we are therefore
anxious to give our readers an in-
sight into some of its most valuable
E. Every farm will ere
ong have its doctor as well as its
bailiff, and the old game of “soldier,
sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy,
apothecary,” &c., evidently contem-
plated a connexion between che-
mists and clodhoppers.
To show what has already been
done by agricultural chemistry, we
) give a few cases which have occur-
- A red within our own practice:—
R case. The FIRST.
- We were called in to a grass plat
§ which was suffering severely from
the mange. The patient was lying
in a back yard in Lambeth ; and our first care was to order a strong
decoction of rain from the water-butt. This caused a slight relaxation
of the hard crustaceous substance that had formed itself on the surface ;
and we recommended gentle friction the next day with an iron roller.
The patient still continuing much the same, we resorted to rather a
desperate remedy. We caused cuttings to be brought from a healthy
body of green meadow, and filled in the parts of the grass plat where the
mange had been most active in its ravages. We soon had the satisfaction
of perceiving that our experiment had succeeded, and having ordered
further friction with a roller for a few days, we left the patient with a
certainty that a cure had been effected.
CASE THE SEcond.
We were called in one day to attend a China Rose, which had been
losing its leaves very fast, and was the last of a family of six that had all
prematurely perished. Perceiving that the unhealthy plant was rapidly
wasting to a mere stick, we determined on trying strong measures at once,
and ordered a constant watering with salts and senna, which we thought
might open the buds, of which there were still two remaining. This
treatment having completely failed, we declined further attendance, having
first recommended the trial of a warmer climate, by taking the afflicted
patient from the window-sill to the chimney-piece.
CASE THE THIRD.
The case to which we are now about to allude is rather curions. It
appeared that some potatoes had been set in the usual way in a strip of
ground at the back of a house in the City, and had not yet shown them:
selves, though five months had transpired. This was evidently a surgical
and not a #º case, which induced us to resort to the spade, a §.
we seldom do but in the last extremity. At the first thrust of the instru-
ment into the earth, we were met by a hard bony substance, which
tly obstructed us. Having withdrawn the spade, we plunged it
into another part, and we soon had the satisfaction of feeling
that we were getting to the root of the disease, and in a few moments
we succeeded in extracting a small piece of potatoe, which was
found to be exactly in the same condition as when it was first planted.
We ordered magnesia for the ground, and left the rest to nature, which
we have often found materially to aid our efforts. We should be happy to
relate further cases, but we {*. not been called in, and have therefore
nothing to make a report about.

RISING YOUNG MEN.
MR. BASIL BLOTT, THE DRAMATIST.
Basil Blott was the son of a respectable attorney in large
practice, and being placed in his father's office at an early age,
seemed destined to be buried behind the gloomy desk of a clerk,
when chance threw him in the way of developing his genius.
It became his fate, in the way of his profession, to serve a copy of
a writ on a celebrated tragedian at the Coburg, who, taking the
document with a scowl, and a malignant exclamation of
“Perdition catch yer soul, the chance is thine !”
at once stamped in our hero's mind an indelible love for the drama.
A coynovit, which naturally arose out of the incident alluded to,
led young Blott and the tragedian into frequent intercourse, which
was only interrupted by the falling due of the first instalment, from
which date our hero never met with the illustrious wielder of the
tragic truncheon.
The destinies of Blott were, however, fixed. He had contracted a
love for the stage, and the passion became fixed by a casual intro-
-
duction to the money-taker at the Pavilion—a patron of letters, and
himself the author of the lay to a popular melo-drama. The confi-
dence that never fails to be engendered over unlimited beer, soon
arose between the money-taker and young Blott, who was soon per-
suaded by his new friend to try his hand at a drama, with a view to
the peculiar powers of Mr. Freer, who was then in the full enjoy-
ment of inexhaustible lungs and unlimited popularity.
Young Blott was not long in concocting a melodrama on the subject
of the BURKERs, who were then under sentence of death, and he pro-
posed strengthening the bill (which is a great proof of his dramatic
tact even at that early period of his career) by announcing a REAL
case or Hocussing as one of the incidents. The Management, how-
ever, who had before shown sufficient spirit to go to the very verge
of such an announcement, hesitated at this, and the programme went
forth without the startling feature that young Blott would have intro-
duced to it.
Our hero, whose object was fame, had the satisfaction of seeing his
piece withdrawn by order of the magistrates, and he repaired with
his friend the money-taker to a neighbouring tavern, where the re-
mainder of the night was passed in alternate sarcasm at the ex-
pense of the authorities and the interchange of friendly sentiment.
The conspiracy which is always entered into by all managers to
exclude works of genius from the stage, wholly prevented the works
of Blott from being given to the public, until his friend the money-
taker introduced him to the light comedian of the Bower Saloon, who
was fortunately on the eve of taking a ticket-night. An intimacy then
sprung up between our hero and the light comedian, while the con-
stant flow of half-and-half was accompanied by gushes of cordiality,
which ended in an arrangement for the production of a farce by Blott
on his new friend's ticket-night. The only condition was, that our
hero should take five pounds' worth of tickets and lend the dress—a
fashionable new suit—for the principal character, which, of course,
was to be sustained by the light comedian. The eventful evening
came, and Blott's new farce went off amid the unanimous clattering
of porter-pots. It is highly probable that Blott will be applied to by
the managers of the patent theatres, and we have no doubt that the
suit of clothes lent to the light comedian will be returned when the
piece has had its run ; which, as it was withdrawn after the first
night, will occur at some not very definite period.
MORAL PATHOLOGY on REIGNING COMPLAINTS.
(skELETON notes FROM. An unpublished work.)
The bribery fever, which has spread during the last two years, with
such incredible rapidity, does not seem likely to yield to the drastic re-
medies lately prescribed for it. The parliamentary faculty in a body
have declared that it is necessary to check theravages of this demoralising
disorder. Copious bleeding and an open exposure of the unhealthy parts
have been recommended, and, in several instances, tried with effect-
whilst in the more inveterate cases, nothing has been found beneficial but
administering a most stringent course of irritants, such as towelling and
flagellation to the member diseased, and subjecting the patient to close
confinement.
WATER on thr BRAIN.
Many people, in consequence of having passed too rapidly from one
temperature to another, have been attacked by a kind of inflammation
which is called arrogance, and which manifests itself by the elevated posi-
tion of the head and shoulders, by the stiffness of the neck and of the
backbone, which can only be bent with extreme pain. The patient also
feels habitual convulsions of the upper ". which give to his countenance
an expression of indolence and disdain. This disorder terminates gene-
rally by a bleeding at the nose.

THE PLEASURES OF MEMORY,
AFTER A PUBLIC Dinner.
Epoch The FIRST.
i can remember the large room at the Freemasons' Tavern, with the
tables still spread out in along line, and a few waiters engaged in clearing
them. I can remember addressing a bust as Mr. Chairman with con-
siderable vehemence; and as a waiter led me by the arm towards the
door, I have a vivid recollection of calling upon him for a speech, a
song, or a sentiment. , My memory then introduces me to a small
respectable gentleman with a bald head, who I recollect was called Mr.
Cuff, and who used the language of gentle remonstrance, advising me to
go home quietly. I remember that I insisted upon first shaking hands
with Cuff, then fighting him, and subsequently the word “Shameful!"
burst upon my ears. After which I recollect nothing but a struggle with
several men in white neckcloths, ending in my being deposited in a state
of semi-consciousness on the steps of the Freemasons'.
Illustriation of WAvrº LEY.
Epoch THE SEcond.
I can remember standing with my back to the railings of St. Giles's
Church, while tho moon was shining brightly above, and I was addressing
a lamp-post opposite on the iniquities of the income-tax. I have some
recollection of being saluted by a distant cry of “Lul-li-e-teel" and I
clearly remember that my hat was removed from my head; while I have
an idea that I was standing on the pavement without my pumps, for I
felt it strike cold to my feet through my silk stockings.
Epoch. The THIRD.
I remember waking in my bed, having been aroused by a knock at
my chamber door; when I was informed that my coat (with one of the
skirts torn off) had been brought to the house by a policeman, who had
found nothing in it but my card-case, from which he ascertained my
residence.
TO MY WIFE-IN FUTURO.
To THE Editor of “Punch.”
SIR-Impressed with the fixed idea that my wife what is to be—if,
indeed, such a person exist—must of necessity, as my future wife, be a
reader of “Punch,” I *: you will see fit to present her with the en-
closed address through the medium of “your valuable publication.”
This being my surest and most unfailing plan for bringing it under her
notice, I am sure that Mr. P., remembering the days when he waited on
his Judy (was it Callaghan 1) at two o'clock in the morning on the night
of the 13th of February, will at once take compassion on the “sighing
swain” longing that the effusion of his soul should meet the eyes of her
for whom it is intended ; and by inserting these verses in his pages,
show her that somebody's coming to marry her, and that that person is
hers and yours most obediently, CHARLEs Hookey WALKER.

Family Lemonade.—Get a jug and run with it to the water-butt,
wash out with a small quantity of aqueous fluid, and wipe dry with a clean
glass-cloth. Now you may take your lemon, being careful to choose the
very best you can meet with. Slice with an ordinary knife into a common
plate, and throw the pieces smartly into the jug, taking care that they
reach the bottom. Seize your sugar-basin, and sweeten at discretion,
adding a little more when you think there is need of it. Take your kettle
and pour your boiling water over your lemon, stirring all the while with
the handle of a toasting-fork. Be careful not to leave off stirring until
you know your sugar is dissolved, when you may sit down and wait for
time to cool the refreshing beverage. Serve up in tumblers or mugs; in
default of which you may drink out of the pitcher.
A Breakfast Decoction for Juveniles.—When you have finished your own
breakfast, take the teapot and fill it up with warm water. Fill an infant's
mug one-fourth part with milk, and add another fourth of pure water.
Now you may have recourse to your tea-pot, from which you may pour
ad libitum, and having added a little sugar, you have a splendid breakfast
decoction for the juveniles.
Periwinkles.—Purchase your winkle in the shell ready dressed, and
turn out from tin pot into plate—which you can have done by your fish-
monger. Serve on the end of a pin, and eat with as much appetite as
possible.

Whetstone Park, Aug. 12, 1842.
Dean Punch,
I have been looking very anxiously for these last two or
three weeks for a continuance of “Jack Brownless,” as the hero of
that interesting little drama is evidently a fellow after my own heart.
My name is
Diddleton Doo.
I am a descendant, both by my father and mother's side, from the
great Doos of Osnaburgh-street, who, about the year 1826, created
such a panic among the chandlery and other establishments in the
neighbourhood of the Regent's Park.
I was educated upon a plan as original as economical. At eight
years of age, I was sent to a seminary for young gentlemen, where I
remained four months and three days. At the expiration of that
time, an intimate friend of my father called with the following note:
DEAR Mas. CRIsscRoss,
Will you be kind enough to allow Master Doo to be absent from his
studies for a fortnight, as his uncle, Captain Readypenny (from whom we have
great expectations), has invited him to spend a fortnight with him? Please to let
him come in his best clothes, and bring as much of his linen with him as
you can. I have the honour to remain (with many thanks for your kindness to
my offspring),
Your obedient and grateful Servant,
Downry ATHElstartz Doo.
I was accordingly despatched, with many “comfortable words,” to
my amiable parents, who, I found, had changed their lodgings during
my absence. I was received by my father with a loud shout of mer-
riment; and the servant—a dirty little girl about twelve and a half—
was despatched with a half-pint bottle to the public-house at the
corner. Oh, what a happy evening we spent 1 My father and his
friend sang songs and shook hands with each other, whilst my affec-
tionate mother drained glass after glass to my future prosperity,
which she contended was certain from the present happy combina-
tion of circumstances.
In after life, I learned the cause of these festivities. My father had
devised a great scheme to educate me—gratis—and this was the first
experiment. I had now been living and learning for upwards of four
months at the expense of Mrs. Crisscross. I had returned to the
bosom of my family, with my best clothes upon my back, and all my
linen (except two shirts and three pair of stockings) in my trunk.
Six weeks were wanting to the vacation; and before Mrs. C.’s suspi-
cions of my father's character could be awakened, we should be con-
cealed in such a labyrinth of lodgings as to defy the possibility of
discovery. Accordingly, about a week after my return, the following
note was despatched by the intimate friend who had been the bearer
of the former one :- - " .
- -
My Dran MRs. Caisscross, :-
You will be shocked to hear that our dear little Diddle has the ring-
worm. As a parent and a man, I cannot think of letting him return until he is
so far recovered as to prevent the possibility of contagion. I have the honour to
. ſº increased admiration of your character from what my little boy has
told me),
Your obedient and obliged Servant,
Downey Arhrlstane Doo.
Mrs. Crisscross wrote back a letter of condolence; and we never
heard whether she made any further inquiries after us. By following
up this system, I received a very tolerable education, with most un-
exceptionable board and lodging; and I never think of my father
without gratitude and admiration.
I remember, upon one of the occasions on which my estimable
parents were particularly hard up, as it is figuratively called, my father
was painfully in want of some brandy-and-water, a stimulant which had
been prescribed to him by the guard of the Exeter Telegraph. For
some hours his necessities seemed to have paralysed his inventive
genius; but at last the Doo prevailed. Tearing the blank page out
of an odd volume belonging to the landlord, he proceeded to inscribe
it with one of the most brilliant ideas that ever characterised any age,
and having buttoned the precious document inside his waistcoat, sal-
lied forth into Regent-street. After promenading for a few minutet
backwards and forwards, he suddenly distorted his face like a Merry-
andrew, and turning round two or three times, fell flat upon his face
on the pavement. A crowd instantly gathered round him; and,
amidst loud cries of “Let him have air; the man's in a fit "-
“Where are you pushing?”—one humane individual rolled him on
his back, and opened his waistcoat. The first thing that met the eye
was the document before alluded to. It ran thus :—
“I’M subjecT to FITs;
PRAY DON'T BLEED ME;
BUT
Give ME A GLAss of BRANDY-AND-WATER.”
The effect was electrical Half-a-dozen hands were thrust into as
many pockets ; and my noble father went to bed that night in a state
becoming the First Lord of the Treasury
You may, perhaps, hear from me again. By the by, can you lend
me a sovereign —Yours, -
DIDDLEton Doo.

Rising Young MEN.
MR. TIMOTHY TARNISH, THE ACTOR.
TIMothy TARN1sh was born somewhere about the year 1810,
speaking chronologically ; and speaking geographically, he came
into the world somewhere about the Seven Dials. His father and
mother were dealers in the general line, and a bundle of old plays
having been accidentally added to their stock, young Tarnish took
what is called “a dramatic turn ;" and this unfortunate pirouette was
confirmed by the purchase of a second-hand scimitar, with which our
hero, as an imaginary Macduff, was wont to cut at an old chair,
which his fancy had marked as the Thane of Cawdor.
Young Tarnish being once singed by the flame of dramatic ardour,
was not to be easily cooled ; and he was particularly ignited by
a volume of Congreves, which lighted up the fire of ambition, and
made him resolve that he would either rise at once or “fall like
Lucifer.” Having helped himself copiously from the paternal till, he
bought the character of Othello for one pound five at a private theatre,
and having rubbed in a sufficient quantity of soot and butter, he was in
due time" made up” for the “filthy bargain.” A pair of black worsted
Indian Rubberu.
stockings on his arms and legs, with red velveteen small-clothes bought
from the footman of a noble Lord, nearly completed the costume of
young Tarnish, who having been informed that there was considerable
nervousness in first “smelling the lamps,” took a vigorous sniff at the
float, and rubbed his nose upon the oil-can at the morning of rehearsal,
in order to get accustomed beforehand to the intimidating odour.
The Othello of young Tarnish was pronounced to be a very remark-
wble performance, and the manager of the Thespian Saloon—a shrewd
critic, and himself the arranger of some feats of strength for the
Mackintosh Untrustables—was so pleased with our hero's perform-
ance, that he offered him on the spot the usual engagement. Young
Tarnish was to receive nothing for the first six months; was to find
his own dresses, pay the usual subscription to the indemnifying fund,
spend half-a-crown a night at the bar, and pay fifteen pounds into the
treasury to secure a benefit. The till of his father enabled our hero
to accept this eligible offer, and he made his first bow to a Stangate
public as the second cut-throat in Macbeth; a performance that so
pleased the manager, that the latter shook hands with him cordially
several times in the course of the night, and complimented him at the
wing on the effective ugliness of his countenance. Young Tarnish con-
tinued to play a varied round of business for several weeks, and having
at length attracted the notice of a provincial manager, he joined a
sharing scheme at a Welsh seaport, where he opened as Charles Surface,
in muddy highlows, a pair of Tweedish pantaloons, and a gambroon
cloak, which were the only articles in his private wardrobe. He sub-
sequently acted Roderick Dhu, in leather-gaiters and a plaid table-
cover, and, once in the course of the season, went on for Virginius in a
sheet, which had been kindly lent him by his landlady. IIe was for-
tunate enough to obtain the patronage of the town-crier, who per-
sonally informed the public of our hero's benefit, by which he cleared
—his own pocket of the little cash that had still remained in it.
Young Tarnish has every hope of eventually obtaining an appear-
ance at Drury Lane or Covent Garden, and though the ascent is
arduous, he will no doubt one day be at the top of a patent house, if
he can muster a shilling to visit the gallery of either. His acting is
somewhat cold—in winter-time—for his utter deprivation of anything
like comfortable clothing is sure to make it so. Perhaps one of his
best assumptions is the cock in Hamlet, which he has played several
nights in a manner that has led to his having been called for occa-
sionally by the audience.

EDUCATION . . .
ANTOMATHIC HALL. An in-
teresting lecture was delivered a few
evenings since at the above place,
by Dr.Olinthus Dabbs, on Education,
developing views which, if not new,
are decidedly broad, involving as
they do an extension of, and im-
provement on, the system of whole-
sale instruction now so deservedly
popular.
The Doctor said that he did not
claim the merit of originality for his
system, and hoped no one would think
he did ; however, that the carrying
out and amplifying of a principle was
the next thing to discovering it, and
often produced results which would
- have astonished the original inventor.
=- A neighbouring people were apt at
invention; we improved on their discoveries; and he would leave it
to his audience to say in which of the two countries the arts and
sciences were in the highest state of perfection. Hereat there was
much applause.
“But,” continued the Doctor, “I am not covetous of fame. What
my deserts may be is neither here nor there. I seek only to be use-
ful. Knowledge, like truth, lies in a well ; and I consider myself,
and am content to be considered, a PUMP whereby the precious
lymph may haply be raised and distributed. If in that capacity I
succeed in irrigating your minds, I shall be quite satisfied.” Dr.
Dabbs then said something to the effect that he hoped he should not
be found dry; at which again considerable mirth was excited.
The Doctor then propounded his plan, which was to combine the
instruction of classes in singing with the communication to them of
general or specific information, by embodying the same in the songs
to be practised. All that would be necessary would be to adapt new
words to old airs. He would not detain his hearers longer, but would
at once proceed to exemplify his method. He had procured the
attendance of a competent chorus; and he would now take a few
miscellaneous subjects, and show how easily and pleasantly know-
ledge might be acquired in a short time respecting them. He could
not do better, he thought, than begin with Geography; and he would
choose a theme that came home, in a manner, to every bosom—the
boundaries of our native land. He then gave a signal, and the chorus
burst forth thus:–
Tune—“ Rule Britannia.”
Britannia's bounded on the North
By Caledonia, famous Land of Cakes;
This fact remenuber, remember from henceforth,
The British Channel her south boundary makes.
Rule Britannia, Britannia rules, the waves;
Britons never, never, never, never will be slaves.
Eastward his proud water pours
The German Ocean wide and deep;
Westward the Irish Channel roars,
And the Atlantic's billows sweep.
Rule Britannia, &c.
Dr. Dabbs did not pretend to be much of a poet; however, though
he said it who should not, he could not help thinking that the verses
just sung did not fall very far short of some passages of Words-
worth's. He would next treat the company to a little history; the
gentlemen and ladies of the chorus would be so good as to favour
them again. They sang accordingly as follows:–
Tune—“Yankee Doodle.”
In England first the Britons dwelt,
The Saxons next did follow ;
But conquering Will did Harold welt,
And beat the Saxons hollow.
Too ral loo, &c.
King William Rufus, call'd the Red,
Was shot by Walter Tyrrel,
Who when he saw the monarch dead,
Cut off like any squirrel.
Too ral loo, &c.
It was advisable, Dr. Dobbs said, to spread a light and agreeable
colouring over the tragic events of history; because no one learns
anything so well as what he learns cheerfully. Suppose they now
took arithmetic. Perhaps the chorus would have the kindness to
state the Rule of Three :-
Tune—“I remember, I remember.”
Third and second terms together,
Youthful student, multiply,–
Well-a-day ! I know not whether
I can do so till I try.
Then, thereof, the product duly,
By the first term, oh! divide,
And the quotient will right truly
Tell what darkness else would hide 1
Here the Doctor observed, that surely harmonious numbers afforded
the best means of teaching arithmetic, indicating by his countenance
that he meant the remark for wit. As such it was received—laugh.
ter ensuing ; whereby he was encouraged further to observe, that it
was a pity that Terpsichore also could not be enlisted on the side of
this branch of intellectual education; for that dancing would neces-
sarily conduce to the acquisition of figures. On this the cachinnations
of the hearers were redoubled, and they likewise stamped and
clapped. “Now,” said the Doctor, “let us have a little fun with che-
mistry. Teach us, gentlemen and ladies, if you please, how to pro-
cure Sir Humphrey Davy's celebrated nitrous oxide; give us a little
laughing gas:–
Tune—Laughing Chorus, Freyschutz.
Nitrous oxide would you make, man,
Retort and receiver take, man,
In the which distil, ha! hal
Nitrate of ammo-ni-a.
Ho! ho! haſ hal &c.
Would you be than March hare madder,
Breathe this gas from out a bladder,
And you'll shout and laugh with glee,
Ho! ho! ho ho ho he he
Ho! ho! &c.
The Doctor then caused various other equally amusing and instructive
exemplifications of his system to be given by the chorus, whose per-
formances elicited great approbation, and must undoubtedly have had
the desired effect of impressing on the minds of all present the facts
which the songs embodied.
&

3}ribate Qſbeatricals.
In compliance with the prevailing fashion, Master Thomas Goodchild
entertained his young friends in Aldermanbury on Thursday last. The
back parlour was appropriated to the theatre, which was one of West's
sixpenny ones; and the piece of “The Miller and his Men” was repre-
sented. The characters owed their stability to a pack of cards on which
they were pasted. We were much pleased with the Ace of Spades, who
threw such firmness into Grindoff. The flour-sack and second miller
were also well supported by an old Horticultural ticket; but we are sorry
we cannot award the same praise to the Orphan's Asylum card, who in
the part of Lothair curled up the minute he approached the lamps, until
his head got between his knees.
Some confusion was created, in the course of the evening, by Master
Peck, a mischievous urchin, who having devoured the crumb of a Vandyke
sandwich, threw the crust on the stage and knocked down the mill, for
which he was blown up instead... Mrs. Goodchild was very effective in the
afterpiece of “Maternal Anger,” particularly in the situation where the oil
|
|
from the front lamps was spilled on the new carpet. An elegant repast of .
mixed biscuits and currant-wine and water concluded the evening's fes-
tivities; after which Mrs. G. thanked her young friends for their
company and sent them home. She has it in contemplation not to ask
any of 3. again to a similar treat.
Punch loquitur.—Can any one tell the difference between the Athenaruwn and the
Literary Gazette 7–Sir Peter Laurie repond: Yes, I can : the one is penalvo, and the
other expensive.

THE LUMBER TROOPERS.
This honourable body has, it appears, vacated the Dr. Johnson's
Tavern, but without the honours of war, for the arms and ammunition of
the troop were detained for a score which had been valiantly run up with
soldier-like recklessness, and left unpaid with military (certainly not with
civil) gallantry.
It appears from the statement, that the sort of ammunition to which
this little band of veterans is attached consists of matter for blowing out,
rather than blowing up ; and the items of their outlay present a pleasing
alternation between summer festivals, dinner-tickets, repairing mortars,
and going it like bricks in the consumption of eatables.
It is fortunate for the peace of the City that the arms of the Lum-
ber Troop are restored before there has been any demand for their use in
defence of the metropolis. The mortar, which, with true military ardour,
the Lumberers had given two shillings to repair, may now be turned with
an intimidating aspect on the largest mob ; and as the cannon from the
Knightsbridge brewhouse has been treated for by the troop, we can safely
predict that there will be no lack of Ordnance.
It is to be regretted that so fine a body of men should have been di-
vested of their implements of warfare for a single hour; but when a
dispute about a tavern score has been the cause, the effect seems
still more deplorable. It is now some time since the evacuation of Bolt-
court by the troop, who, taking the word “bolt” in its familiar accepta-
tion, were apparently resolved on crossing the Fleet-street line, and whilst
surprising the landlord by leaving him in the rear, bringing up the van to
remove their anmunition, without paying the price of their former (pot)
yalour. This splendid military manoeuvre has, however, failed, and the
honourable payment of 16', 10s, has placed the troop once more in pos-
session of the brass mortar, the portrait of their Colonel, the rusty swords
of former veterans, and four ounces of gunpowder.

Of its scarlet tint the Poppy may boast,
But I with myself am quite content,

The London Pride has a longer stem,
The Scarlet Runner grows more tall,
But what does the Buttercup care for them?—

There's more refinement about the Pink;
But seize the wine-cup each thirsty throat,

MISS TICKLETOBY'S LECTURES ON
ENGLISH HISTORY.
LECTURE VI.-HENRY I.-MAUDE.—STEPHEN.—HENRY II.
WE have still a little more to hear of honest Robert Shorthose.
With his usual luck, the poor fellow came posting back from Jeru-
salem, a month after his brother Henry had taken possession of the
English crown; and though at first he made a great noise, and got an
army together, with which, as he was a valiant captain, he might have
done his brother some hurt, yet the latter purchased him off with
some money, of which Shorthose was always in want, and the two
came to a compromise, it being agreed that Robert should keep Nor-
mandy, and Henry England, and that the survivor should have both.
So Shorthose went home with the money his brother gave him, and
lived and made merry as long as it lasted; and the historians say that
he was such a spendthrift of a fellow, and kept such a Castle Rack-
rent of a house, that he was compelled to lie in bed several days for
want of a pair of breeches. (Much laughter at the imperturbed way
in which Miss Tickletoby pronounced the fatal word “breeches.”)
But Henry, for all the agreement, would not let his brother keep
possession of that fine Dukedom of Normandy. He picked continual
quarrels with him, and ended by taking possession of the Duchy, and
of Shortlegs, in spite of his bravery, whom he shut up in a castle,
where he lived for near five-and-twenty years after. His fate inspires
| one with some regret, for he was a frank, open fellow, and had once,
in a siege, saved from starvation this very brother who robbed him;
but he was a fool, and did not know how to keep what he had, and
Henry was wise; so it was better for all parties that poor Shortlegs
should go to the wall. Peace be with him " We shall hear no more
of him; but it is something in the midst of all these lying, swindling,
tyrants and knaves, to find a man who, dissolute and brutal as he was,
was yet an honest fellow.
King Henry, the first of his name, was, from his scholarship (which
I take it, was no great things; and am sure that many a young lady
in this seminary knows more than ever he did) surnamed Beauclerc
—a sharp, shifty fellow, steering clear, amidst all the glooms and
troubles of his times, and somehow always arriving at his end. He
was admired by all Europe for his wisdom. He had two fair king-
doms, which had once been riotous and disorderly, but which he
made quiet and profitable ; and that there might be no doubts about
the succession to the throne, he caused his son, Prince William, to be
crowned co-king with him, and thus put the matter beyond a doubt.
There was, however, one obstacle, and this was the death of Prince
William. He was drowned, and his father never smiled after. And
after all his fighting and shuffling, and swindling, and cleverness, and
care, he had to die and leave his throne to be fought for between his
daughter, and his nephew, one Stephen ; of the particulars of whose
reign it need only be said, that they fought for the crown, like the
devil and the baker, and sometimes one had it and sometimes the
other. At last Stephen died, and Maude's son, Henry II., came to
reign over us in the year 1154.
He was a great prince, wise, brave, and tender-hearted; and he
would have done much for his country too, which was attached to
him, if the clergy and the ladies had left him a moment's peace.
For a delicate female—(a blush covered Miss T.’s countenance with
roses as she spoke)—the subject which I am now called upon to treat,
is—ahem —somewhat dangerous. The fact is, the king had married
in very early life a lady possessing a vast deal of money, but an indif-
ferent reputation, and who having been wicked when young, became
very jealous being old, as I am given to understand is not unfre-
quently the case with my interesting sex.
Queen Eleanor bore four sons to her husband, who was dotingly
fond of them all, and did not, I have reason to suppose, bestow
upon them that correction—(a great sensation in the school)—which
is necessary for all young people, to prevent their become self-willed
and licentious in manhood. Such, I am sorry to say, were all the
young princes. The elder, whom, to prevent mistakes, his father had
crowned during his lifetime, no sooner was crowned, than he modestly
proposed to his father to give up his kingdom to him, and when he
refused, rebelled, and fled to the King of France for protection. All
his brothers rebelled too;-there was no end to the trouble and per-
plexity which the unhappy king had to suffer.
I have said that the Queen was jealous, and, oh! I am ashamed to
confess, when speaking of his late Sacred Majesty, a King of England,
that the Queen, in this instance, had good cause. A worthless,

nothing creature, whom historians, forsooth, have handed down to
us under the name of Fair Rosamund–OFair Rosamund, indeed! a
pretty pass things are come to, when hussies like this are to be be-
praised and bepitied 1)—Isay, a most wicked, horrid, and abandoned
person, by name Miss Rosamund Clifford, had weaned the King's
affections from his lady, Queen Eleanor.
Suppose she was old and contumacious": do not people marry “for
better, for worse?” Suppose she had a bad temper, and a worse
character, when the King married her majesty: did not he know what
sort of a wife he was taking?—A pretty pass would the world come
to, if men were allowed to give up their wives because they were ill-
tempered, or go hankering after other people's ladies because their
own were a little plain, or so I (Immense applause from the ladies
present. And it was here remarked—though we do not believe a
word of the story—that Mrs. Binks looked particularly hard at Mr.
Binks, saying, “B., do you hear that?” and Binks, on his part, looked
particularly foolish.)
How this intimacy with this disreputable Miss Clifford commenced,
or how long it endured, is of little matter to us: but, my friends, it is
quite clear to you, that such a connexion could not long escape the
vigilance of a watchful and affectionate wife. 'Tis true, Henry took
this person to Woodstock, where he shut her up in a castle or laby-
rinth : but he went to see hir often—and, I appeal to any lady here,
could her husband, could any man, make continual visits to Wood-
stock, which is five-and-forty miles from London, without exciting
suspicion? (No, no!)
It can’t be to buy gloves—thought her injured majesty, Queen
Eleanor—that he is always travelling to that odious Woodstock:-
and she sent her emissaries out; and what was the consequence? she
found it was not glove-making that the King was anxious about—
but glove-making without the g! She instantly set off to Woodstock,
as fast as the coach would carry her; she procured admission into
the place where this saucy hussy was, and drawing from her pocket
a dagger and a bowl of poison, she bade her to take one or the other.
She preferred, it is said, the prussic acid, and died, I have no doubt,
- we grieve to remark, that Miss Tickletoby, with a violence of language that is
not uncommon amongst the pure and aged of her sex, loses no opportunity of twit.
ting Queen Eleanor, and abusing Fair Rosamond. Surely that unhappy woman's
fate ought to disarm some of the wrath of the virgin Tickletoby.
in extreme agonies, from the effects of the draught. (Cries of Shameſ)
Shame!—who cries shame? I say, in the name of injured woman,
that, considering the rude character of the times, when private
revenge was practised commonly, Queen Eleanor served THE
woman Right ! (Hear, hear ! from the ladies; No, no! from the
men; immense uproar from the scholars in general.)
After this, for his whole life long, Henry never had a moment's
quiet. He was always fighting one son or other, or all of them
together, with the King of France at their back. He was almost
always victorious; but he was of a forgiving temper, and the young
men began and rebelled as soon as he had set them free. In the midst
of one of these attacks by one of the Princes, an attack was made upon
the young man of a sort which neither young nor old can parry. He
was seized with a fever, and died. He besought his father's forgive-
ness when dying, but his death does not appear to have altered his
brothers ways, and at last, of a sheer broken heart at their perverse-
ness, it seems that Henry himself died: nor would he forgive his
sons their shameful conduct to him.
And whom had he to thank for all this disobedience? Himself
and FAIR Rosamund. Yes, Irepeat it, if he had not been smitten
with her, the Queen would not have been jealous; if she had not been
jealous, she would not have quarrelled with him; if she had not
quarrelled with him, she would not have induced her sons to resist
him, and he might have led an easy and comfortable life, and have
bettered thus the kingdoms he governed.
Take care,then, mydearyoung friends,if youare called upon to govern
kingdoms, or simply, asis more probable, to go into genteel businesses
and keep thriving shops, take care never to offend your wires. (Hear,
hear.) Think of poor King Henry, and all the sorrows he brought
upon himself;-and in order not to offend your wives, the best thing
you can do is to be very gentle to them, and do without exception
every single thing they bid you.
At the end of this lecture, several ladies present came up, and
shook Miss Tickletoby by the hand, saying they never heard
better doctrine. But the gentlemen, it must be confessed, made
very light of the excellent lady's opinions, and one of them said
that, after her confession, even if she were young and handsome,
nobody would ask her to marry.
Nobody wants you, Sir, said Miss Tickletoby; and she was more than
usually rigid in her treatment of that gentleman's little boy the next
day.
THE NATURAL HISTORY OF COURTSHIP.
CHAPTER VIII.-OF THE MAN who is AccEPTED.
WHEN you see a man whose countenance is unceasingly irradiated
with an endless succession of smiles, as if his mind contained as
many excellent jokes as a number of “Punch,” an internal explosion
of which is continually taking place—an individual who, hitherto
perhaps, slow of speech, staid in habit, talks very fast, shakes you
violently by the hand, and invites you to a quiet Champagne dinner
with a “dozen fellows or so,”—one who is eternally running about
between his club, his lodgings, Howell and James's, and the house
in Grosvenor Square—a man, in short, restless, with a kind of irritable
delight, which keeps him in perpetual motion, and enchants him with
a couleur-de-rose, view of everything around—who declares it is “charm-
ing weather” whilst it pours in torrents—who denies the distress of
the country, and assures you it is a mere phantasy, proceeding from
Mr. Duncombe's brain, in spite of the equally empty stomach of the
Lancashire rioters;–when you see a man betraying these symptoms of
temporary insanity—assure yourself that he has just been accepted.
This kind of fit lasts about a week. By the end of that period
the affair descends to a matter of business, for the affianced is
brought to a sense of his situation by the lawyers—his imagination
becomes clothed in skins of parchment: those effectual sedatives—
settlements—recall his erratic thoughts, and he begins to talk to his
friends about “future prospects;” and actually giveth the required
notice at his club for withdrawal therefrom. A visit to the vicar
general—a breakfast from Gunter's—a whirl to his family “place”
in the country—a paragraph in the “Morning Post”—and (as they
say in plays, when describing some pathetic catastrophe)—and—all
is over !
This is the uniform fate of the accepted who move in decent
society. A step lower in the scale of social existence presents a
different picture. George Bacon once “regularly engaged” to Mary
Hammon, he is a markedman amongst his own friends, and those of
his fiancée: they become spies upon the progress of the courtship.
Mrs. Dust, the rich grocer's wife, never sees the lover without com-

mending his choice, and patronising the lady, by calling her a “nice
girl.” Should he, in a moment of exuberant volatility, commit him-
self to an attempt to kiss Miss Griggs, that young lady simpers,
throws her eyes quite into the corners of their lids, and threatens
Wim, if he don’t keep quiet, that she will tell Miss Hammon. When,
at a party, it accidentally happens that some female friend is seated
next to the bride elect when her beau enters the room, the former
immediately rises, and, with a significant smile, points him into the
chair.
The attentions which are exacted from the lover in public by the
lady herself, and by her friends in her behalf, are onerous and un-
ceasing, that they may be talked about and boasted of; consequently
it does not signify how severely he takes his revenge in private, by
neglect and bearishness. Every action, every trait of disposition and
temper, belonging to each, is universally canvassed by every person
who knows them. They are, in fact, the stock-talk of their set, till
marriage puts a stop to their comments.
Thus, if in the course of courtship the hearts of two persons of this
class become inspired with a pure, unaffected love for each other—
that most sensitive, sacred, secret of our passions, is immediately de-
secrated by the vulgar breath of small-talk. All those thoughts
which we nurture in the deepest recesses of the soul with the purest
sentiment, are dragged forth to be made subjects of unsympathising
ribald chatter. The bare suspicion of this feeling, which so few really
experience, and so few can consequently appreciate, subjects the ac-
cepted who possesses it to a round of well-worn jests, which are
not the less coarse because not positively indelicate, the lightest of
them a deep and bitter wound inflicted upon its object. Should lovers
in this station of life declare to “wear their hearts upon the sleeve
for daws to peck at,” and decently get married in secret, savage are
the censures of their acquaintance on the immorality of “hole-and-
corner weddings”—implacable is their resentment on being disap-
pointed of a show, a breakfast, of patronising felicitations and wed-
ding visits. -
“Bless me ! why you surely would not have everybody married
privately f"
“No, dearest Priscilla, not everybody—none but lovers. Hear a
French writer on this subject : At the moment when two beings
kneel side by side before the cross of eternal life, they should command
respect, and the ceremony of their union ought to be accomplished in
seclusion with tender effusions of joy, far away from the frivolous and
ignoble mockeries of the world. To those, my charmer, whose union
is the result of mere courtship, I am very willing to allow public
breakfasts, and paragraphs, and post-horses.”

Why are persons with short memories like Ministers in office?–Because they are
always for-getting everything.
THE PENNY-A-LINE PANIC.
An extraordinary sensation has been created by a circular from the
office of a leading morning paper, announcing that in future all para-
graphs will be paid for at five farthings a line instead of the usual sun
of three halfpence.
It is impossible to describe the panic which this intelligence has
caused among a very large class of men who have hitherto earned an
existence by the labour of their heads, hands, and legs, in inventing,
writing down, and carrying for insertion, the numerous paragraphs which
are to be found every day in the newspapers. One of the most influential
penny-a-liners in the metropolis—the author of some of the most elabo-
rate pieces of fiction that have ever graced the public prints—has been
making use of very strong language, and going into a cheap coffee-house
to which penny-a-liners resort, he insisted on a turn-out, which was
strongly objected to.
By the new arrangement, the fact of an early gooseberry being found
in a garden will not realise more than five-sixths of the sum it formerly
used to produce ; and a gigantic cabbage, which used to give a dinner to
a family of twelve, will now only supply a full meal to ten of them.
The question is, on all hands, what is to be done? Our own opinion is,
that there will be over-production; but this will be frightful, for there is
already such a glut of “horrible accidents” and “alarming catastrophes,”
that there is scarcely a field left which the most fertile fancy could revel in.
There was a report last night that an attack had been made on the letter-
box of the Morning Post, but it happily proved groundless. The bell of
the Sun was, certainly, rung at midnight, with the view of causing a
rising; but the diabolical scheme was unsuccessful, as the housekeeper was
not to be roused by the vile machinations of a marauder.
The penny-a-liners are a desperate set, and it is likely that as they are
curtailed in their price, they will proceed to any lengths rather than submit
to a diminution of their profits. It is therefore to be expected that
accidents will be very numerous, and i. elaborated; for the suffering
manufacturers of paragraphs will not hesitate to prolong the horrors of a
calamity—however awful—for the sake of their own selfish measures.
A party of penny-a-liners have been paradingShoe-lane and Fleet-street
all the morning, and a meeting has been called to take into consideration
the propriety of an application to the Society for the Protection of Life from
Fire, who, by multiplying their sets of apparatus, may confer an immense
boon on the reporters of accidents. The orange crops—or harvest of cata-
strophes from slipping down on pieces of orange peel—may be said to have
entirely failed, and there is nothing now to look to but the November
fogs, and the continued cutting off of the gas from the roads in the metro-
politan suburbs.
NO CAUSE NO EFFECT.
A Rumour was very general during the past week that our revered friend, Colonel
Sibthorp was labouring under an inflammation of the brain. Tom Duncombe has,
however, relieved the public mind by boldly asserting that there is not the west
foundation for the report,
Why do young people go to a confirmation always in now clothes?-Sotlift they
may not be confirmed in their old habits.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. JOHN
HORATIO SMITH HAS RETIRED
FROM OFFICE |
N MONDAY last this awful announcement
reached us from the hands of a weeping news-
vender.
Three days ago Mr. Goulburn (the Chancel-
lor of the Exchequer) politely showed John the
* door, exclaiming, in a most infacete manner,
S. “John Smith, I am sorry to say you must go.”
- - Immediately on quitting the Chancellor's offi-
===2 cial residence, Mr. Smith was observed to look
red—to look round—to look up—to look down—to adjust his hat—to point
his cravat—to whistle—to saunter—to turn about—to stamp the sole of
the shoe, boot, or blucher, incasing his left foot, on the ground—to apply
the third finger of his right hand to his sinister eyelid (to intimate he was
wide awake)—to incline his head once or twice rather quickly, on his
breast—and, finally, to rush towards the sentry-box on the opposite side
of the way, as with a determination to seclude himself from the world
about him, and the boiling effects of the meridian sun. This transient joy
was not permitted him, for the sentry was but a weak man, and as two in
a sentry-box, on a sultry Dog-day, do not contribute much to each other's
comfort, the civilian was coolly informed that he was in the wrong box,
and that he must accordingly make an incision into his prosperity (i.e.,
cut his lucky).
Mr. Smith was seen to make for the river. Our informant here took a
tender and final farewell of his retreating figure; and we are afraid that
an aquatic suicide was his aim, for he was heard to say that, as the land
was too warm for walking on, he should go up the water; but whether
Mr. Smith was metaphorically expressing his intention of availing himself
of the temporary convenience of one of the iron steam boats as a mode
of transit to Lambeth, Vauxhall, or Chelsea—whether the idea of the
first or second of our suggestions ruled his mind, “Punch" won't be bold
enough to assert—without knowing.
All he can do, is to explain the cause, not the end, of the apparent un-
accountabilities—to speak plainly, the circumstantial compages of ir-
rationality—in Mr. Smith's behaviour on the eventful morning in question.
This —this is a task “ Punch" is unhappily called to, but which, for the
satisfaction of his friends and the public, he embraces with a grim
earnestness and
*~mmer"
A BLUE-DEvil, DETERMination.
Mr. John Horatio Ernest Maltravers Walker Smith first appeared
before the public as an assistant-porter to the suite attached to the Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer's department. His duties were various and im-
portant, requiring an activity and intelligence which none but those sys-
tematically educated by the government can arrive at. To summon in
a moment of emergency a cab from the nearest stand—to exercise his
talaria in a journey to the Admiralty, Post-Office, or Colonial Office,—to
run wildly between the hours of one and three to the—little Treasury
dining-rooms, to stagger at divers periods of the day under the burthen
of “half and half” or “draught stout”* for his several official asso-
ciates (a cancellario ad imum)—to wander over abstractedly the columns
of the Times—towards four or five P.M. to recline languidly in a large
arm-chair—to doze, and finally to fall into the proprieties of a Downing-
street slumber ;-these may be said to represent the onera of the proud
position Mr. Smith enjoyed.
Time rolled on (as slowly as that garden implement which was sent into
the world to do away with the inequalities of gravel) and Mr. Smith felt
happy and secure in his seat. Ahil Ahi : The Whigst—the dirty-trea-
cherous-cowardly-selfish-mendicant-lying Whigs deserted Mr. Smith and
the country, and a new Chancellor took the seals and the salary, who soon
proved himself to be past Baring.
How futile are the prospects of man! Mr. Smith's principles (1), like
those of other mighty men, underwent a toal change to ensure tenure of
office. Mr. Smith's activity and intelligence were rubbed up to an agonis-
ing extent under his new master, but all would not do. The Chancellor
had his eye upon Smith—Smith was a marked man—and every little pe-
culiarity of his was construed into a direct dereliction. (The fact is,
Smith's berth had been mortgaged six months before.)
Malheureuw enfant / Smith had ever complained of the irksomeness
of office. Now, under the malignance of a prejudiced Chancellor, he
* Names, we believe, given to potatory incentives for revigilating official
lassitude.
* See “The Times” for these epithets.
-
warmly observed, the office was becoming subjugate to the sudorific sway
of the puripneustic Pluto (vulgo, going to the d–l).
What was to be done?, Smith against the new administration 1 Why,
nothing but a course of lick-spittle servility, which should frustrate even
the acute treachery of a Wellington himself.
Ah, but Rome had its days of declination. Theodore, king of Corsica,
went to the King's Bench (his very proper place). The Margate Hoy
is turned off the waters of the Thames. Doctor Morison has sold all
his pills. Every dog has had (and will have) but his day. So Smith was
fated to fall from his high estate.
On the eventful afternoon before the prorogation of Parliament, Mr.
Rodney Jones, one of the choice runners for the Admiralty, was observed
to enter the house No. 11, set apart for the official dinners which the
Chancellor of Her Majesty's Exchequer is bound to give.
Passing into the resting-room of the swift-footed messengers, he raised
his hat, and having smoothed his fevered brow with a fever-inspiring
cotton handkerchief, he remarked, in a strange, contradictory spirit—
“ that he was quite blown by the heat.”
Hereupon Mr. Smith jocularly observed, that that fact occasioned him
no surprise, when he reflected that Mr. Jones was perpetually finding
aliment for his perspiring tendencies by his frequent outgoings from the
paths of ebriety.
Mr. Jones in a brisk sally retorted with an allusion to Mr. Smith's mu-
sical propensities being so often evolved by strong liquors—“that he,
Jones, wasn't so bad as he (Smith), who was as drunk as a fiddler every
*: of his life.”
he demon of discord now threw down another unsavoury apple in the
suggestion of Mr. Smith, “that Mr. Jones must be under the influence of
some deadly beverage to think of such a thing.”
Mr. Jones here muttered something to the effect, that when Mr. Smith
had taken “that letter (the object of his mission) to Old Goulburn,” he
(Mr. Jones) would accommodate him (Mr. Smith) with a wipe on the
mouth.”
Mr. Smith said, “he should rejoice to see him.”
Mr. Jones (who it must be confessed was very shaky in his gait and
appearance) gave a clear and forcible exposition of his intentions in hurl-
ing a small inkstand at Mr. Smith's pericranium, which passing its desti-
nation, went through the glass door into the passage, and came curiously
in Sir G. Clerk's face.
Mr. Smith answered the compliment (what would Sir E. L. Bulwer's
feelings have been had he witnessed this desecration of literature and
fashion I) by heaving forward Boyle's Court Guide, which falling on Mr.
Jones's hat, forced the same over his eyes and nose—rudely coursed
down his once white linen, and finally lodging itself in the folds of his
ample folded waistcoat, forced him—a small stout man of five feet one
—to pose himself supine on the deal boards of the messengers' room.
How he, Mr. Jones, was carried out—how the other he, Mr. Smith, was
carried in—forthwith examined, and depositions were taken down by the
junior clerk's assistant's secretary, as to the cause, &c., &c., of the civil
or uncivil) difference—how that on receiving an account of the same, the
hancellor leapt up from his dinner-table, exclaiming “That's all right,
Smith shall remove his crayons” (i.e. walk his chalks)—how that he
mixed an extra glass of Hollands in the gladness of his heart—how that
several minute circumstances in the lives of Mr. Smith and Mr. Goulburn,
took place before the deed recorded in the opening of this notice—all
this, and much more, we leave to the Queen Dowager's factotum, Lord
Howe. Punch winds up by exclaiming, -
“zuł0, i &u aopp, ro p 6ar ipe odkkes.”
3Foreign intelligentt.
OUR Barcelona papers bring us nuts to the 25th, and our correspondent
at Ripstone has promised to let us have pippins up to the latest hour at
which an express can be despatched from the quarter alluded to.
Our intelligence from China consists of some hieroglyphics on the cover
of a tea-chest, from which we can make out nothing of º. ; but as
there is the name of an English dealer written over the unintelligible
characters, we have presumed that commerce is still carried on in some
cases.
Our letters from an uncle in America inform us of the establishment of
our relations in that country, which, as they went out without any hope of
influencing the people by pecuniary outlay, is extremely satisfactory.
Our Kamstchatka courier has not arrived—nor do we expect him.
Our latest advices from the North Pole omit to speak of the British
flag, which we always understood to have been nailed to the top of it.
SIBTHORP ON AFRICAN GEOGRAPHY.
Just previous to the vote on the West-African-Expedition-Grant, Sibthorp, deter-
mined to get well “up" in African topography in time for the debate, pencilled on a
leaf of his pocket-book the following query, which he passed over to the Commodores
—“Whether the Bight of Benin was more dangerous than the bite of the centipode?"
—The answer was lost in thundering cachinnation.

THE DOO CORRESPONDENCE.
Whetstone Park, Aug. 20, 1842.
DEA a Punch,
Many thanks for the sovereign—it was light weight, but I
lost nothing by it, as I filled up the milled edge with bee's-wax.
Let me see—what shall I send you this week! Oh! I'll tell you
how my father Downey Doo was done.
My youngest sister (who had been thoughtlessly christened Susan,
but who was generally called by the family Nourmahal), one day had
the good fortune to find three tickets for a ball at Guildhall, and our
excellent parent, who never lost a chance of advancing or feeding his
children, overcame the one scruple which my mother professed to
entertain, and resolved upon using the tickets at all hazards.
Nourmahal, who had formed an intimacy with a dyer's daughter,
soon contrived, by the assistance of her friend, to construct a very
imposing ball-dress, whilst my father and myself were excellently
appointed, as my generous parent (who gave out that he was about
to stand as a
MEMBER for the honough,)
had recently undertaken to patronise a confiding young man who
had just commenced business as a tailor in the New Road.
At eight o'clock precisely a glass-coach drove up to the door, and
my father completely silenced the liveryman who came with it for
the money, by requesting to be driven instantly to the Russian Am-
bassador's. On arriving at Prince Knoutatowskoff’s, my father was
let out of the carriage, and thundered away at the door as though he
had been the Emperor himself. The Legation were nearly paralysed,
and a minute or more elapsed before the astonished porter recovered
himself sufficiently to open the door. When the portals were thrown
back, my father walked in as boldly as a lion; he then started as
though extremely surprised, and declared his conviction that he was
not at Number 32, and was instantly assured that he was at Number
59. My father protested his regret, but would not leave the house
until he had seen an attaché, whom he requested to explain to his
Excellency the error into which he had fallen, and, at the same time,
to convey to the representative of All the Russias my father's apolo-
gies and “the assurances of his continued respect.” His object was
gained—he returned to the carriage, and the liveryman touched his
hat as my father shouted “Guildhall.”—The liveryman was done.
The ball was as per heretofore. My father, who was ever alive to
do himself good, had remarked a young man, whom he knew to be the
son of a well-to-do hosier, paying very great attention to Nourmahal,
and I was accordingly despatched to make his acquaintance, and
puff the family. I succeeded beyond my expectations, and in less
than a month afterwards he had formally declared himself a suitor
for my sister's hand and heart—need I add that he was accepted
In order that no impediment should stand in the way of my sister's
marriage, my excellent paternal parent had liberally promised to give
Nourmahal three thousand pounds on her wedding-day. As that
happy period approached, my father began to perceive the incon-
venience he should suffer if he attempted to carry out his generous
intentions. Accordingly he waited upon the father of the bridegroom
elect, and confided to him the secret—not of his inability to pay the
promised dowry, but of his determination to make it six thousand
instead of three. The paternal hosier was overpowered with my
father's munificence, and declared that a bill due three months after
marriage was decidedly preferable to the ready money. My father
took him at his word, accepted the bill, and left the church, on the
day of my sister's union, the happiest Doo that ever ate the bread of
ingenuity. -
One month after this occurrence, a letter with a black seal was
put into my father's hands—my uncle, Dabbleton Doo, had died
suddenly, and left my father six thousand pounds, the exact amount
of the marriage bill My worthy progenitor saw at a glance the
misery of his situation—he was in a position to pay, and the thought
was torture. Long—long did he struggle to avoid an act so abhor-
rent to his nature, but the paternal hosier was too much for him, and
every shilling of my uncle's legacy went to my sister's husband and
the lawyers. , Nourmahal has cut us, and actually refused to set us
up in the coal-trade.
How can I send you back the sov. If you lend me another,
I can give a man a shilling to bring it to you.
Yours, DIDDLEton Doo.

SONGS OF THE SEEDY.—No. xxi.
Believe not the tale that appearances tell,
Nor trust in the glitter of jewels or gold;
But trust me, dear Sue, there is many a swell
Would be knock'd down for nothing by auction if sold.
Though the purse may be fill'd with bank notes by the score,
Oh think not the paper the emblem of cash ;
On the poor Bank of Fashiou 'tis easy to draw,
Remember, sweet love, that the notes may be flash.
I've watch'd the vile tempter, I've seen him walk in
To the shop where mosaic and tinsel abound;
Then I've seen him emerge with a thundering pin,
Made of nothing but brass with a sham jewel crown'd.
Oh then I’ve observed him look round with an air
As if he would say “Don’t you think it will do?”
The villain has ventured to smile on the fair—
Oh let not such villains look kindly on you !
Nay, come little Susy, don't look so sedate;
I know very well, cruel maid, what you mean:
You would say that though dress you would not over-rate,
A lover ought still to be fit to be seen.
Then adieu, haughty Susan—ay, sneer at my hat—
'Tis a gossamer-well-ah I you smile at my shoes.
They are strong eight-and-sixpennies—well, what of that 2
Sneer again, at my stout six-and-eightpenny blouse.
Farewell !—it is over ! I henceforth am mute.
For ever, thou proud one, for ever we part ;
I did not believe that in urging my suit,
You thought of my clothes and neglected my heart.
But oh, when the gilt from the brass is all rubb'd
From the trinkets of him thou preferrest to me,
You will think of the one thou hast cruelly snubb'd,
And the sight of a blouse shall be madness to thee.

The following delicate simile on the contemplated Royal visit to the Land
of Cakes has been kindly put into verse, at our request, by the talented
authoress of “Lays to a Lady-bird:”—“When Her Majesty visits the
land whose emblem is the thistle, she will find that, although it has thorns
to protect it from the hands of those who would touch it with impunity,
it has down on its breast for the gentle hand of love and affection”
When Her Majesty visits the Country of Thistles,
She will find that its foes must beware of its bristles ;
But the hand of affection may touch it sans gloves,
For the down on its breast is for those whom it loves.
Will the Penny-a-line Poet, in his next Notice to Correspondents,
obligingly inform us whether the thistle was selected as an emblem of
Scotland because a certain class of animals are partial to it, and whether
he is himself a Scotsman –also, whether the thistles which are to be so
polite to Her Majesty are single- or double-breasted

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON IDLER.
chapTER Ix--or THE Moon ER (continued).
O keep company with the pro-
gress of the Mooner from Picca-
dilly to Lincoln's Inn, we must not
now walk beside him across St.
Martin's Lane.
When the sugar-plum shop was
~ existing in New Street, it proved,
next to the book-stall, his grand
resting-place. He was riveted by
the lollipops, oyster-shells, rashers
of saccharine bacon, eggs, calves'
heads, legs of mutton, Albert rock,
and brandy-balls, which were so temptingly displayed therein. But
now the shop has gone—whither we know not, but incline to the idea
that it was gradually sucked away by the legion of sweet-toothed
little boys who whilome clustered round its windows—so the Mooner
passes on without stopping, except for a minute at the Lilliputian
warehouse, where the tiny socks and shoes call forth all his admira-
tion; and he cannot exactly understand how the little gloves, that
appear to be flying all about the window like so many kid butterflies,
are attached to the panes of glass. His only other source of delay
may be to listen to the catalogue of a perambulating melodist, who
appears anxious to dispose of many yards of new and favourite songs
for a penny. We would give a report of the merchant's oration, but
the subject is worn out.
When the Mooner has once entered the middle thoroughfare of
Covent Garden Market, half-an-hour elapses before he makes his
appearance at the other end of the avenue. He raises or depresses
his nose to smell every plant and bouquet that he may chance to
pass, and inquires the price of every pottle of early potatoes on his
road. This he does with an earnestness of manner that almost
inclines the seller to think he is about giving a fashionable dinner-
party, where, of course, the greatest point to make it go off well is,
to persuade each of your guests to eat nine immature French beans,
and two small potatoes about the size of birds' eggs, with an appa-
rent indifference as to the extent of consumption that may induce
your friends to believe you are in the habit of dining from such dainties
every day, as long as they are out of season—or, at least, sufficiently
removed from their proper time of perfection to render them extra-
ordinary delicacies.
The rest of the journey is performed by the Mooner in an uncer-
tain space of time, varying in accordance with the number of play-
bills he may encounter, the accidental upset of a patent safety-cab, or
the sudden outbreak of a street-row. If the latter of these causes
should be drawn to a sudden close by the interference of the police,
he may possibly digress to the left, as far as the Bow-street Office;
but should it pass off quietly, his only other grand delay will be at
the stage-door of Drury-lane, where he passes away a pleasant half-
hour in endeavouring to recognise the histrionic talent that passes in
and out that mysterious portal in the unambitious toilet of a morning
rehearsal.
We have occasionally encountered many of these Mooners in the
quiet taverns of Fleet-street, where they are apt to dine, because the
gravity and absence of anything like bustle in those steady eating-
houses harmonises well with their disposition. They are comfortable
places too—those old Fleet-street taverns — and they carry the
thoughts back to the days when Dr. Johnson blew his cloud—we are
not exactly following his lexicographical definition of words—by the
side of the old-fashioned fire-place, and occasionally floored some
unhappy wight with the sledge-hammer of his conversation—speci-
mens of which are so agreeably brought in amongst the anecdotes of
the Colossus of our language which sparklein Boswell's autobiography.
There is a similar character pertaining to all these haunts, an
antique room with a sanded floor, and adorned with a smoke-disco-
loured paper, which, if removed at any time with a view towards bean-
tifying the apartment, has invariably injured the business of the house,
and driven awaythecustomers. Some have faded curtains between the
feeding-stalls; and on the mantelpiece, before the old looking-glass,
may, possibly be placed two tumblers full of wooden pipelights
-alumettes is the more refined term—and a pewter inkstand, con-
taining a black dry coagulum which was once ink, and a nibless pen.
There is a clock that ticks with a solemn and subdued beat, and a
weatherglass of grave aspect, celebrated for its inverse predictions of
ooming change. Even the flies that linger about these localities
~.
have an antique air; they are evidently not of the same race that
bustle about Verey's windows, amongst the cakes and bonbons; but
these march about the table amidst the crumbs with an important
gravity, induced by their having used the house a long time, and thus
established themselves upon terms of the most intimate familiarity
with the frequenters.
A rash landlord once made an attempt at innovation by hanging a
play-bill upon one of the hat-pegs; but it was met with intense
indignation on the part of his regular customers, and was forthwith
taken down—the void thus occasioned being filled up again by a
framed advertisement of some pale ale of peculiar merit. Elsewhere
a portrait of some favourite waiter of other days may be seen
“delivered in trust to the landlord;" and there is a vision of
numerous punchbowls through the window of the bar, which looks
into the room, and sometimes discloses a young beaming face, belong-
ing to the guardian nymph of the lemons and lumps of sugar, in
pleasing contrast with the antique fittings-up of the room.
Embryo Templars, sharp puking attorneys, quiet men of business
pertaining to Fleet-street who live out of town, and verdant
clerks, here refresh themselves; together with young men of orderly
and precise bearing, who are slow at taking a joke, and incline to
stewed cheese by way of dessert. The Mooner may soon be recog-
nised at these resorts, by the length of time he takes up in perusing
the Standard.
Two or three other customers are waiting for it, but he heeds them
not; he goes regularly through the paper, from the first advertisement
to the imprint, with a prolixity that induces expectants to think he
either cannot spell very fluently, or that his comprehension is not
over rapid, much to the annoyance of the others, some of whom have
refreshed themselves with the advertisements of the outside half of
the Times for the last twenty minutes.
There are various parts of London frequented by the Mooners,
where, like roach pitches in the Thames, you are almost certain to
find a specimen of the tribe. On fine days they delight to bask in the
sun upon the floating piers of the fourpenny steam-boats; and at all
times the erection of a new club-house, or foundation of a new lamp-
post, is a sure piece of ground-bait to entice them. They collect in
great numbers round the Houses of Parliament on favourable after-
noons, gazing listlessly at the cabs and led horses of the honourable
members; and above all, they love to lean over the parapet of London
Bridge, loitering away the hours in watching the bustle of the Pool, the
slow progress of the lighters, and the departure of the Gravesend,
Woolwich, and Boulogne steamers. The Mooner does not often
venture on board these latter craft, because, once there, whatever
may be the inducement to stop, he must go on—a species of comparative
progression which does not at all suit his habits; and for this very
reason, he prefers the most obsolete stage-coach to the whisking
railway. -
Au reste, the Mooner is a harmless being; not susceptible of an
extreme pleasure; but, on the other hand, equally insensible .

regard to discomfort. He dawdles through life as he does in the
excursion we have just described ; and when he dies, goes to the
grave in the same loitering manner, almost regretting that he cannot
attend his own funeral, to watch it pass, and afterwards go with it
into the cemetery and read all the tombstones.
THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY.
MANchest Fºrt Faertics.
LAMBETH.
At eight o'clock yesterday morning all the hands employed in
plastering the new houses near Bedlam left their work; but they re-
turned in half-an-hour, without the interference of the authorities.
The same alarming occurrence took place in the middle of the day,
and afterwards at four o'clock, when they were met in the yard by a
man with beer, which justifies the suspicion that there is some one in
the background who supplies them with provisions.
An immense number of persons paraded the New Cut on Saturday
night, and stared in at the provision shops, occasionally handling a
joint of meat, and even asking the price of it. Some went so far as
to carry it away after having paid for it.
Considerable excitement prevailed among the greengrocers, who
could hardly keep pace with the demands made upon them for vege-
tables; but it is a remarkable fact that though the mob seemed
determined to secure provisions, no objection was raised to giving a
fair price for them.
THE GREEN PARK.
At about dusk there was a general turn-out from the enclosure in
this park; and though many of the hands would have remained for
the purpose of effecting a piece of work, they at last went out quietly,
and a mill was stopped which would have been got into full play if
the turn-outs had not succeeded in their object.
RATHBONE PLACE.
The mill for grinding coffee in this district has only been going
half the week; but this is the choice of the proprietor, for no force has
been employed to stop it. Crowds, or rather groups, of two or three
—chiefly boys—have, however, been observed loitering about the
mill whenever it has been at work—though this is supposed to have
been intended as a diversion, rather than a serious demonstration.
CHARING CROSS.
The cab turn-outs—and very wretched-looking turn-outs some of
them were — assembled in large numbers on the coach-stand at
Charing Cross; but they gradually dispersed by one at a time—though
it was observed that as one left the rank another generally joined it
in a short time afterwards.
THE MARSH GATE.
Our own correspondent, who has been residing here in consequence
of the public distress—as well as his own—writes to us very gloomily
from this quarter. He complains bitterly of having been himself the
victim of a turn-out, by means of his own landlord, who seems to
have joined the malcontents; and our correspondent is of opinion
that the landlords will continue to enforce their rents at all hazards.
It was reported that there had been a turn-out and a rising among
the laundresses in this district for wages. We have ascertained the
foundation for this rumour, which originates in the fact that several
laundresses did rise and actually turned out—of bed at a very early
hour for the wages which they are generally allowed when going out
to work by the day in private families. The police were walking up
and down during the whole of the day, and it was said they had been
tampered with. This appears to be incorrect, for, from returns which
have been ordered, it would seem that of two hundred glasses of gin
consumed by the force in one afternoon, one hundred and fifty were
drunk off duty, forty-six were paid for by themselves, three were
given by the landlords, and the remaining one was part of a half-
quartern left by a drunken man on the bar of the public-house in
which he had called for it.
VAUXHALL.
The turn-outs were very noisy here on Thursday last, and several
explosions were heard in the neighbourhood of the gardens. Dresses
of various descriptions were worn for the purpose of disguise; but
most of those assembled, who were principally clerks, apprentices,
and shop-boys, returned to their work on the following morning.
CHELSEA.
Our letters from this place inform us that it continues quiet in the
extreme; and indeed it has been asserted that a pin was distinctly
heard to drop in a house in the High-street, by a gentleman seated
alone over his dessert, from whose neckcloth a brilliant mounted in
gold had accidentally fallen.
WANDSWORTH.
Our correspondent in this quarter is in high spirits. The Tariff,
letting in foreign asses, has already begun to have its effect on the
donkey-riding business; and there are now nearly ten constantly
saddled, where four were hitherto more than sufficient to meet the
demand of the public.
A rising was not expected; but the beadle had been sounded, and
it was alleged that he might be relied upon in the event of a crisis,
provided the crisis should not be too much for him.
THE WIND-UP.
It will be seen that all the accounts above recorded are so far
satisfactory. If there is any general cause for alarm in any direction
to which our information extends, it is in the case of the Suspension
Bridge at Hungerford, where, if a rising takes place, a turn-out is
sure to follow ; for if the Thames rises and fills the coffer-dam, the
workmen must turn out as a matter of pure necessity. We hope for
the best; but in this quarter we can only look for the worst—which
has up to the present time invariably happened.

have the odd trick; but it is then discovered that diamonds were not
trumps, though nobody can remember what was. Now, as there were
about nine revokes out of thirteen rounds, what does either party score t
Answer.—If N. had not put his queen upon O.'s tray, that, in all pro-
bability, would not have drawn out S.'s quatre, and B. would not have
played the deuce; so that, upon the whole, every person was to blame
for forgetting what was trumps; and taking all these facts into considera-
tion, we cannot undertake the responsibility of answering the question.

THE MAN IN WINDSOR CASTLE.
If every Englishman's house is his castle, it is quite clear that the
Queen's castle is not as sacred as every Englishman's house is said to
be. Windsor Castle seems to be regarded by some people just as
Jack Straw's on Hampstead Heath, or any other castle where man
and beast are invited to partake of the entertainment provided for
them.
It is sometimes made a subject of complaint that the residences of
Royalty in England are not so accessible as they should be to the
people; but after the Boy Jones's and Lord Godolphin d'Arcy's
recent visits, it would appear that the public have only to “walk up,
for they are now in time.” just as they would at Wombwell's or
Richardson's. We find from the papers that the intruder at Windsor
Castle is in excellent spirits; and we are told by the reporters that
he “flourished his bundle” on leaping from the cab, “with an air of
triumph.” How he succeeded in throwing a triumphant expression
into a dirty pocket handkerchief and a pair of stockings—which is all
that his bundle consisted of—we find it rather difficult to imagine;
but the rampant fancy of a penny-a-liner is never subdued by
apparent impossibilities.
The individual is said to be very reasonable on every point except
his claim to a peerage, upon which he comes out so particularly
strong, that he is pronounced fit for Bedlam. We sometimes hear a
good deal of the privilege of the entrée, which we thought was allowed
only to Royalty, Foreign Ambassadors, and Ministers of State ; but
to these, it appears that pot-boys must henceforth be added. The
civil Authorities.
intruder, when asked how he got into Windsor Castle, replied, that
he “followed a pot-boy;” from which it is evident that pot-boys are
permitted to walk, unquestioned, up to the very door of the Royal
Nursery. We are aware that nursing requires sustenance of no
common kind, but surely the demand for heavy wet cannot be so
urgent and frequent, as to require that the “pot-boy” should walk
unmolested in and out of the most private apartments of the Royal
residence. Since the days when common porters were engaged in
carrying King Henry's beer, we have heard of nothing equal to the
audacity of modern pot-boys.
Since the commencement of our mirthful labours, we have
never willingly obtruded a line or a thought that could make
our readers sadder by the perusal, and it is not from an “idle
humour” that we now seek to enlist their sympathies for one
whose playful fancy has often shed its brilliancy upon our pages.
The following appeared in the Standard of last Saturday:—
“Death of Willian Mayinn, Esq., LL.D.—With deep regret we
have to record the death of Doctor Maginn, this day, at his
residence, Walton-upon-Thames. Doctor Maginn was in his 49th
year, and for the last year and upwards suffered from confirmed
consumption. He has left a widow and three children, we fear
without any provision but the claim of the lamented deceased
upon the gratitude of the country, and more especially of the
wealthy and high-minded Conservative party. That claim is,
however, a strong one; for more than twenty years Doctor
Maginn laboured for the Conservative cause without relaxation,
and to the support of that cause he brought more learning, more
genius, and more zeal, than any other man connected with the
public press during the same period.”
We believe this brief summary to be a just one, and we have
that reliance upon the generosity of our countrymen, that we
feel the legacy which Maginn has bequeathed to his children will
be honourably and liberally acknowledged by those to whose
cause his gifted mind was unceasingly devoted.
We know that we shall be pardoned for this departure from
our beaten track; we have stepped aside to hang our humble
immortelle above the grave of genius, not from the hope of
adding to the fame of the departed, but from the desire to
evince our sympathy with the living and the dead.

PUNCH*S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER WI.-P.JNCH INTRODUCES HIS SON TO
- PHILOSOPHY.
WHAT I my dear boy, my last letter has thrown you into a fit of
melancholy? You look hopelessly, recklessly, on the prospects of
human life, and would fain flee into a hermitage, there to ponder on
the mysteries of social humbug—of life and death ; the toils and
the trifles of mankind

This resolution on your part reminded me that I was the fortunate
possessor of a few fragmentary thoughts on the vast subjects you
would contemplate—of thoughts born in solitude of a restless brain
that has long since mingled with the earth. Take them—ponder on
them—and for the present, be content to know them as–
“FRAGMENTs on HUMBUG, SolITUDE, LIFE, DEATH, AND
SELF-KNow LEDGE, BY THE HERMIT of Con Ey-HATch.”
I have thought it wise and pleasant in my solitude, having no
ready-money market for my time, to devote my hours on hand to the
intellectual wants of my fellow-man. The reader, affected by the
beauty of my subject, may haply feel a generous curiosity, may
yearn to know the condition of the sage who seeks to discourse upon
the most vital, the most profound, the most mysterious principle of
human society, for such is humbug. It is the cement of the social
fabric. It is the golden cord tying together, and making strong, the
sticks and twigs of the world. It is the dulcet bell, whose ravishing
sound calls the great family of man to eat, drink, and be merry I
Hapless are they, whose leathern ears list not the music; for if they
feed at all, at best they feed on draff, and are to the revellers even
as swine are to bipeds.
Let not the reader seek to know more of me than, with a most
white conscience, I am permitted to tell him. The great events of
my life are not my own. I speak without any oracular quibble; I
mean this, and no other. The great accidents of my mortal travail
have been sold ; yea, bartered by me for so many Mint medals, and a
stamp receipt given for the payment. Thus it was. In a moment of
pecuniary impatience, I offered a choice of the events of my life to a
gentleman in want of materials for a popular novel. With a frank.
mess that has been of singular loss to me throughout my existence,
I opened the goods unreservedly before him. As market-wives say,
I let him have the pick and chuse of the lot; kept nothing back
for a second huckstering. Well, the buyer left me without a decent
event in my basket. Every picturesque accident, from exaggerated
homicide to the forgery of a will in a moment of vinous intoxication,
was bought, and I confess as much, honestly paid for by the novelist
'fore-mentioned ; and, if there be truth in human bargains, as indeed
there must be when solemnized by a stamp, for otherwise, casuists
WoL. III.-1842
have their opinions,—the incidental property of my life belongs to
the purchaser. I have this consolation; my mundane struggles have
affected, delighted, and instructed the world, though labelled with the
name of another. Though I have remained, and must remain un-
known, my deeds, dressed to the best advantage, have enraptured thou-
sands. Like the ostrich plume waving above the whiter brow of a
lovely peeress, my life has found its way among the richest, and by
consequence, the noblest of the earth, whilst I, the liver, the poor
plucked bird, have wandered over barren sand and fed on iron. But
this is a story older than quills.
I have nothing, then, of my life at the service of the reader, but
that part of it, the poor remnant following the bargain narrated
above. This being my own property, I shall invest it in the present
volume. My birth and parentage I have sold, and, I honestly
believe, at their full value. There, however, remain to me a few
fragments which, like sweepings of a spicery, though not good
enough to season a holiday dish, may give an enduring sweetness to
a cold body of philosophy. The cloves and cinnamon which the
clean-handed housewife would reject for her pudding or custard, may
serve for the dead belly of an embalmed Plato. In these days,
philosophy itself must be spiced and sweetened, and have its eyes
taken out, lest it become noisome in the nostrils of society. That
too shall sometimes be the most acceptable body of philosophy, which
retains the least hint of bowels.
I know not what business women have with goose-quills, beyond
that of plucking them from the bird of mischief that the animal may
become the better companion for apple sauce. The later prejudices
of the world have, however, concluded otherwise; hence, my
maiden aunt, Abishag Jones, excelled all the family in her writing;
perhaps it was, that she was the only one of her tribe who wrote
bank cheques. My poor father was never so happy as when he
could get a pen between the fingers of Aunt Abishag. We grew up,
it may be said, with an instinctive reverence, an innate admiration
of the handwriting of Aunt Jones. Now, I believe it is an
acknowledged principle of human action, that what we greatly
admire, we often seek to imitate. At all events, it happened so to
me. With untiring energy, I laboured to emulate the flowing
delicacy of Aunt Abishag's pen; and at length succeeded to such a
nicety, that a gentleman, a perfect stranger, handed over to me fifty
pounds as a reward for my zealous ingenuity. -
Women are fantastic animals 1 I make no flourish of this dis-
covery; indeed, I almost fear that others, it may be in the dark,
have stumbled on the hidden truth. My Aunt Abishag was, however,
a living and most energetic illustration of the fact ; for it was to be
reasonably supposed that she would have felt a flutter of pride at the
successful genius of her nephew ; that she would have considered
his delicate imitation of her caligraphic powers as an elaborate
homage to her best endowment. It was otherwise. Vindicating the
prerogative of her sex, she became so capriciously obstreperous, that
respecting even her most violent whimsies, I renounced the world
and all its selfishness, and became that which I now am.
“What is that f" asks the reader. -
With a brevity, which I hope will distinguish the small-talk of my
future life, I will endeavour to answer the query.
My Aunt Abishag confined not her inquiries of the whereabout of
her ingenious nephew to her personal exertions. Hence, availing
herself of the bounteous powers of the press, she caused my por-
trait to be typographically delineated, and as a most touching proof
of her regard for me, offered the princely sum of twenty pounds to
whosoever should snatch me from the wily temptations of liberty,
and hold me in safe keeping.
I will not attempt to describe the emotions which stirred within
my breast, and rose to my throat, as I perused this last affecting
evidence of my aunt's regard. Happily, I was diverted from a too
intense contemplation of woman's tenderness, by a notice, that in the
same gazette, somewhat irreverently shouldered the manifesto of
Aunt Abishag. From that notice I take these words :-
“A Hermit wanted. To philosophers, misanthropes, or gentlemen
in difficulties, a singularly eligible opportunity presents itself. A
nobleman of enlarged political views is desirous of engaging an indi-
vidual for the term of three years in the capacity of hermit. The
party engaging will be required to conform to the most rigid discipline
of eremite life. No Irishman need apply; and as the nobleman is
desirous of assuring to himself every probable guarantee for the due
performance of the contract, married men only will be treated
with.” -
I looked from my Aunt Abishag to the nobleman of enlarged po-
litical views—I wavered but for a moment between my affection, my
duty to my aunt, and a new-born, romantic desire to let my beard

and nails grow. In brief, for it is in the result only that the reader
is interested, here I am, at this moment, in my hermitage—a snug,
weather-proof box, eighteen feet by ten—with an oak table, one
stool, one platter, one maple cup, a bed of dried rushes, one blanket,
one gown, one hat, one staff. Here I am on the night of this—day of
, in the year of Christian hopes, with the bell of Coney Hatch
Church jerking twelve. Here have I been these twelve months; and
if a neighbouring fountain reflect truly, then am I as reverend and
venerable an anchorite, especially about the chin, as any nobleman could
desire to spend his cash upon. I have more than once thought—and
strange to say, there has been a fearful pleasure in the errant notion—
that if in this drear solitude I should be made the subject of a
popular murder, my locks and beard worked in brooches, ear-
rings and bracelets, would realize sufficient from the romantic and
the curious to endow sundry anxious persons with becoming fortitude
for my untimely loss. I have, however, as speedily banished
this vanity as unworthy of my new self—as unworthy of a cell, that,
according to a very stringent agreement drawn up by the attorney of
Coney Hatch, is to be a shrine for unselfish contemplation; a retreat,
wherein the highest powers of intellectual man, are, by daily exercise,
by nightly discipline, to climb the golden chain of necessity, and
strike delicious music from every link.
THE MODERN SPHINX.
SoME patriotic individual has been puzzling the town for these last three
months by erecting at Charing Cross the annexed mysterious combination
of masonry and tarpaulin. Whether it has sprung up in rivalry to the
Nelson Monument, or has been placed in its present position as a stationary
umbrella—whether like that Veiled Prophet of Khorassan, it be too sublimely
frightful for mortal eyes, or, like Lot's wife, inconveniently soluble in rain-
water, we know not. Can it have had its origin in the charitable bosom
of some deceased crossing-sweeper, who may have bequeathed the savings
of a long life for the erection of this architectural curiosity, in order that
the succeeding generations of his eraft might have an abiding-place against
the “pelting of the pitiless storm 2''
Will some of our peripatetic friends be kind enough to ferret out the
intention of this eighth wonder of the world !
A NEW ESCAPEMENT.
The Secretary of the Fire Escape Society has written an indignant letter
to the Morning Herald, complaining that in the report of the late fire in
Tottenham-court Road, that paper had omitted to mention the number of
three-legged stools, deal-boxes, and feather-beds, whose existences were
spared by means of the machines. Rather unfortunately, however, for
his good intentions, we read in the same paper, that the only severe acci:
dent during the fire, occurred to two men, after climbing up an “escape”
to the second floor, when the ladder broke in the middle, and let them
down to the ground. If this is the usual manner in which folks are pre-
served from being burned, the alternative is rather hazardous.

And the Count, with his usual politeness,

(Pertaining to the flight of a party of dishonest Red Men from Catlin's
Museum of North American Indians.)
The path over Primrose Hill, which had gradually become less dis-
tinct in the approaching darkness, now appeared to stop altogether
in a tangled maze of fern and brushwood, which stretched in the
direction of Wormwood Scrubs. Now and then the light of the
moon fell for a few seconds on the tangled coast before them ; but
was quickly withdrawn again, as a few dark clouds, chased by the
wind in fitful succession, passed over her face.
As they proceeded, in silence, the Indian keeping his dark eye
fixed on the ground, the report of a gun was heard in the distance,
prolonged in ringing echoes round the Hill, and a bird, which Cor-
duroy Breeches pronounced to be a crow, flew screaming away, until
it was lost in the distance.

“The Mingo is not loved by the Great Spirit,” replied the old man.
“His moccassins are without shells and his wanpum is not strong.
He drinks the firewater of Hodges, and the thunder of the pale-faces,
Pigou and Wilks, kills him.
“They have passed by here, however,” exclaimed Corduroy
Breeches. “There is the impression of a tipped highlow on that mole-
hill. The trail is too marked to be of more than six hours' standing.”
The Indian bent his keen eye in the direction indicated by the
Scamp, and muttering his usual subdued “Hugh 1” picked up a small
cylinder of crockery.
“The Huron chooses the naked weed,” he exclaimed : “and is not
this a short pipe? He is a great medicine, and his scalps are as the
sea-sand.”
“Here is part of the tobacco-screw,” cried the Scamp. “What
does it say, Chief ?”
Catchhookpike took the bit of paper, and inspected it in the moon-
light with a searching glance.
“The seller of the leaf speaks in parables,” he replied, “and the
Mohican knows not their meaning. What is the difference between
fish alive and live fish Has my brother a name f"
“The Mingoes,” replied the Scamp, “call me Corduroy Breeches ;
the Delawares term me Le Rusé Naret; but on the line I am called
the Artful Navvy, or navigator.”
“The navigator takes to the deep waters and the floating houses of
the pale faces; and this is an iron road. Where is my brother's
canoe Has he sold it to the Hurons, or is it up the spout of the
White-skins 1'.'
“He has reason,” thought the Scamp. “It is neither, Chief,” he
continued, speaking in the Delaware idiom. “Is not the medicine-
store of Catlin in the Egyptian Hall? and hath he not the canoe "
“My brother has still his rifle,” remarked the Indian.
“Ay, I have,” replied the Scamp, affectionately regarding the
piece. “Killcat has proved himself a good friend.—But silence;
we are approaching the deep recesses of St. John's Wood.”

Godolphin D'Arcy, when he went in with the pot-boy.

(Really from our own Reporter.)
WE are authorised to state that Miss Kelly's Theatre (No. 274
Dean-street, Soho) will be opened at the usual season. The most ex-
traordinary alterations and arrangements will be made during the
recess; and it will give the enchanted public some remote notion of
the grandeur of the improvements contemplated, when we inform
them that, on the first night of the new season, the check-taker will
appear with—his hair cut.
Advices have been received from Switzerland, from which we
learn that, on the departure of the courier, Mr. Charles Kean had
reached the summit of Mont Blanc. We rejoice to hear this, as it
sufficiently proves to the enemies of that very promising actor, that
Mr. Kean can, when he pleases, be really a high tragedian |
The author of Martinuzzi has forwarded to Mr. Macready a new
tragedy. “It has,” says the Observer, “the very highest promise 1"
“but,” adds Punch, “not the remotest chance of performance.”
We learn that Mr. Sainsbury, the “saline chymist” of the Strand,
is in correspondence with the spirited proprietor of the English Opera,
sultry season, as the coolest possible place for ginger-beer and soda.
It is a remarkable fact that a bottle of beer, taken into the gallery
of the Victoria Theatre, almost boiling hot, was after the first act of
Mr. Osbaldiston's King Lear, found deliciously iced. A distinguished
wine-merchant of the New Cut has offered Mr. O. very handsome
terms to play the whole round of his tragic parts (so long as the pre-
sent weather lasts) in his cellar.

When Evans sought the abode of joy, he left behind him a very pow-
erful stage reputation at Covent Garden. Some few years afterwards, on
poor James Warde being taken suddenly ill somewhere in Chancery Lane,
during the run of Knowles's Wrecker's Daughter, there was every chance
of the run being stopped. In this dilemma, Knowles rushed to the bar of
Evans, who, in the handsomest manner, consented to enact, “for one
night only,” the character of the very sick tragedian. It was a full house.
Evans entered with beating heart. A burst of applause followed, and
then ensued a dead silence. Evans had to speak, but ere he could open
his mouth, our dear friend Jack Brownless, located in a private box, called
forth, in a voice that made the whole pit jump—“Gentlemen, give your
orders; the Landlord's in the room.”

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON IDLER.
CHAPTER x.-OF THE VISITOR. To LonDon.
LTHOUGH the visitor is a pro-
vincial by birth, yet he ranks as
one of the London Idlers the in-
stant he arrives in town; indeed,
the more remote his country resi-
dence may be, the more entitled
is he to be classed as such.
When alone, his head quarters
are merely coach-office inns and
Piazza hotels ; but if married, he
takes furnished lodgings for him-
self, wife, and (according to cir-
cumstances) daughters, in Arundel
or Norfolk Street, which a friend
has probably engaged for him.
An author has stated that the plea-
sure of travelling consists not so
much in the enjoyment of the pre-
sent, as the retrospection of the
past ; and this is possibly the idea
º upon which the visitor acts, since
his whole journey is a series of nuisances from beginning to end. The
first discomfort begins at the terminus of the railway, where he can-
not remember which locker his luggage was put into, and, conse-
quently, losing the omnibus during the search, is compelled to hire
a cab at a quadruple fare. The lost bag, portmanteau, or whatever
it may be, is at last found under the seat he had been occupying ;
after the railway porters, in their strenuous exertions to discover the
property, have concealed themselves successively in every locker,
with only their legs visible, like so many bees half-way up a train of
bell-flowers, or, more correctly, like Mr. W. H. Payne when that
eccentric gentleman shuts himself into a door or enchanted helmet,
in a Covent Garden pantomime.
At length the visitor arrives at his apartment, after encountering
dangers on his journey, to which the perils of the Khyber Pass were
but minor annoyances; and then the usual first-night-in-a-new-
lodging discomforts crowd upon him.
• There is no tea, no bread, no candles, salt, or lump-sugar; every.
thing has to be purchased, and when purchased, to be stowed away
in various chiffoniers of that shabby-genteel appraisement-looking
build which one only encounters in furnished lodgings, with creaking
hinges, faded curtains in front, rusty keys, and ricketty locks that
only the landlady can open. And there is a sad cheerless air in
lodgings. The very furniture has a sharp and famished appearance,
although rubbed up to the last point of friction, and the carpet is
brushed until it is threadbare. The hundred insignificant objects
that made home Home—those remote appealers to our feelings,
although only books, pictures, or children's toys littered about, are
nowhere visible. The very chairs have an expression of outline which
seems to say “I am only yours whilst you pay for me ;” the fire-
irons and fender look cold and formal; and the round mirror, with
its frame of gilt knobs and distorted candelabra, has an air of at-
tempted gaiety, that is perfectly distressing to contemplate.
And .. the visitor awakes on the first morning of his sojourn in
town—which he does at an early hour, after a slumber broken at in-
tervals of every twenty minutes by the never-dying murmur of tho
London streets—his first business at breakfast is to spread the map
of London widely open before him, and commence a deep investiga-
tion of the nearest practicable road from one point to another. Short
cuts proverbially take up the most time to accomplish ; and for this
reason the visitor spends half his day in losing himself in a labyrinth
of courts and alleys. Having decided upon the first sight that he
shall visit, he sallies forth, and commences the undertaking by dis-
covering the residence of a friend, to whom he has given two days'
shooting last year, and upon whom he reckons, to run about with him
all day long, and show him the Lions of the Metropolis.
All persons living in London know what country friends are—
useful people, who send them up pork and eggs, and whom they
delight to go and stay with when they are tired of town ; but whom
they are sometimes shy of introducing to their metropolitan circle.
Our old friend, Mr. Ledbury, has some country friends; and every
year two of the “gals” come up to stay with his family. Fine
healthy strapping young women they are, too, who can walk for ever
and never feel tired: and although Mr. Ledbury sometimes feels
uncomfortable when he is gallanting them about the Pantheon, and
pretends not to see Miss Mitchell and Miss Hamilton, whom he
meets, but looks hard at the perpetual pictures there displayed, yet
his importance and gratification are very great when he takes places
for them at the English Opera House. Then they go and return in
a hackney-coach, and he tells them which is Mr. Harley, and Mr.
Oxberry, and Miss Faucit, and Miss Murray, as they come on the
stage, without ever looking at the play-bill; or explains the story, if
it is a burlesque, interlude, or ballet; and adjusts the binocular-
glass for them, which he hired at the oyster-shop in Vinegar-yard
before they went, but which the young ladies cannot use very well
without shutting the left eye with their hand.
Upon the taste of the London friend, should he be disengaged,
depends the class of wonders which the visitor is introduced to—of
course, provided always, that the friend is not “extremely sorry an
unpleasant engagement prevents him from enjoying the pleasure he
would otherwise have felt, in showing his acquaintance whatever was
most worth seeing in London.” One will consider a walk round the
parks, a stroll up Regent-street, and a glimpse of the clubs, every-
thing to be looked at. Another will not rest until he has taken the
visitor to every shilling exhibition between Bond-street and Temple-
bar. And a third has an idea that, like at Naples, a man has only
to see the Docks and Post-office, and then die.
The wide difference between the West End and the oriental
districts of London, is no chimerical distinction ; and we can prove
this by the following anecdote:—
Mr. Elphinstone was a gentleman—that is to say, he kept a cab
and all sorts of things besides—wore mustachios and white kid gloves,
lived in May Fair, and was a member of one or two clubs. But,
although he affected an idea in society that London terminated in
space somewhere about Charing Cross, he had an aunt who resided in
Finsbury Square ; and as he expected to come in for a share of the
property, he thought one day he would pay her a visit. Accordingly,
he presented himself at her house in a travelling cap and large
cloak.
“My dear nephew,” said the old lady “are you going off any-
where l’”
“No, my dear aunt,” replied Mr. Elphinstone, “I am but just
arrived.”
“Where from ?” asked the aunt.
“At present from the Albany,” was the answer.
“Ah,” responded the old lady, doubtfully, imagining, no doubt,
that the Albany was some place on the Rhine. “And when did you
Start : *
“About half-an-hour ago.”
“My dear nephew,” exclaimed the aunt, “what are you talking
about !”
“A very simple affair,” said Elphinstone. “I live at the West
End–you reside in Finsbury Square. Being desirous of paying you
a visit, I got out my travelling attire, and having gone down to
Messrs. Herries & Co.'s for some of their circular notes, I procured &
post-chaise from Newman's, and started from home at one o'clock.
I have arrived here safely as you see—and I shall return to London
in the same manner.”
Since that time Mr. Elphinstone has always used the same means
to pay a visit to his aunt, who, it is hoped, will leave him sufficient

to prevent his ever paying the like attention to his uncle. We only
quote this anecdote, to show that, with all properly educated people,
Finsbury Square has nothing in common with London; and that its
inhabitants know as much about the West End, as a frequenter of
the gallery at Sadler's Wells, does of the “Omnibus” box at the
Opera.
THE NATURAL HISTORY OF COURTSHIP.
CHAPTER IX.-PLAIN DIREctions for Count ING THE Ugly.
THERE is not throughout the whole range of the difficult science we
are discussing a more arduous task than that of courting an ugly woman.
The decided beauty attracts and exactingly demands our admiration
and addresses as matters of course. The cut-and-dried compliments
which were doubtless handed down to posterity by the inmates of
Noah's Ark are frequently fished for and led up to by herself, and
one pays them as currently as courtiers do homage to the throne—
for etiquette sake. The “plain” attach to themselves a suspicion of
beauty which affords sufficient foundation for a superstructure of
civil things, the truth and sincerity of which they may be made most
implicitly to believe. But the ugly
Yes, to the mere lover the ugly present a blank. He has no cue for
his sighs and tears—no excuse for his preference. Upon what text
can he discourse in his first love-letter To what reasonable cause
can he refer the lighting up of his flame? To the grace of her figure
—that is almost deformed. To the fire of her eyes!—they are small,
grey, and lustreless. To the sweetness of her smile –it wrinkles
her face into the puckers of scorched parchment. Where there is
nothing to admire, how is he to prove the integrity of his admiration
Yet there is a cause for his preference; but, alas ! that spring
must ever remain a sealed fountain. Far from daring to hint, he
must ingeniously conceal, the true origin of his tenderness. Blighted
are his hopes should she once suspect he sighs for her fortune in-
stead of herself! And, be it remarked, en passant, all ugly women
hare fortunes.
Those who have not are never courted: they are either entirely
passed over, or, if the windfall of a sigh should happen to alight upon
them, they never lose a chance; they accept and get married as soon
as possible, before there is time for the operations of courtship even
to commence.
Thus “cribbed, cabined, and confined” in the range of matériel for
sentiment, what is to be done? Hear our plain directions—they are
infallible.
You must in every case begin by using all the dowager and passé
arguments against beauty. “Fleeting dowry 1–evanescent as the
summer cloud—worthless as the withered flower—often leading its
unhappy possessor into the paths of temptatist-abandoning her in
the depths of destruction—leaving her at last tº ºurn over blighted
hopes"—and all that. But, on the other hand, “who can sufficiently
estimate the lasting blessings of congenial sentiment—of heartsfondly
beating in a blissful union —the never-dying graces of the mind”—
and so forth. But the most effectual topic of all—especially in a case
where a few thousands a year are at stake—is the delights of content
and love in a cottage. “With such a mind as yours, even poverty
would be endurable,” will always prove a clencher.
You will find that every woman who is remarkable for her ugliness
is said to be also remarkable for some especial virtue, accomplish-
ment, or specific perfection. Whenever you hear it remarked that
“she certainly is very plain,” there will always follow a “but,” which
introduces an addendum on the amiability of her disposition, the
superiority of her talents, or the beauty of her foot.
Behold Frank Kennedy after his signal rejection by Rose Robinson,
at the feet of Miss Boulder, and take a lesson from him. His satirical
description of her personale, recorded in a former chapter, though ex-
aggerated, had some foundation in truth. Heafterwards discovered her
weak point—otherwise her peculiar accomplishment;-it was poetry.
With eager hand he turned over the “Keepsakes” and “Books of
Beauty” of the last dozen years, until he lighted upon some of her
stanzas. Those he most admired were “Lines to my Cousin on
entering the Army;” “Impromptu on the Death of Lady Littleton's
Squirrel;” “Stanzas to my Sister on the birth of my niece;” and
other domestic pleasantries so exceedingly entertaining to the public.
What was to be done—how could he address her in her own language
who had never penned a-verse in his life? He rushed to my rooms,
communicated his distress, and demanded my assistance.
“My dear friend,” was my exclamation, “you know not what you
ask. Write poetry to a poetess it would be madness.”
“On the contrary, I believe it to be the only road to her fortune—
or rather, I should say, to her heart. Do throw off something for me,
like a good fellow—something touching and romantic.”
“No, no ; that might answer very well with a city, or a board-
ing-school damsel, but would prove an utter failure with Miss
Boulder. She, of all others, would know how to estimate your
passionate protestations and innumerable notes of admiration; she,
being herself of the initiated, understands the depth of those feelings
which are expended in fishing up rhymes and agonising for similes.
She will take all your passionate rhapsodies at their real value, and
curl her hair with them. No, if you will be rash and pelt her with
verses, they must be quiet, staid, and respectable.”
“Well, I am in your hands. At all events do something for
me.”
Icomplied, and the following rhythmatic crescendo did the business:–
While musing o'er the sweet melodious lay
Traced by thy beauty-teeming pen,
Long ere mine eyes had caught one cheering ray
From thine—I liked thee even then.
But when I first beheld thy soul-lit face,
Beaming with smiles, by thought inspired-
Where Love and Genius each have left a trace,
With fervent ardour I admired.
Now, dizzy with the magic of thy smiles,
Though 'gainst their influence Istrove,
My bursting heart my fever'd brain beguiles,
Hopeless, I fondly, madly-love.
when an ugly woman cannot, with any conscience, lay claim to
talent or good temper, the redeeming personal advantage is boasted
of in an exquisite foot or a delicate hand. My friend Lady Flabble
weighs at least sixteen stone, and is ill-looking in proportion. .
“But then,” say her toadies, “did you ever see such a beautifully-
shaped hand?”
A thick volume of anecdotes may be collected from the small
talk of her circle about this celebrated member; such as, how that
a popular sculptor, so struck with it as he saw it dangling over a box
at the Opera, would be introduced to the owner, to ask permission
to take a cast oft. And that it is now a substitute for the well-known
digits of Madame de Maintenon, hitherto the first hand of the
plaster shops—the sole model for the studio. - The expedients of her
iadyship to bring her favourite manus into notice are highly amusing:
Her favourite attitude is the stock-posture among portrait-painters
for contemplation, the thumb being used as a bracket for the chin,
and the fore finger pressing the cheek-bone. This position produces
a fine effect; for her ladyship's face being of a deep red, sets of the
whiteness of her cherished hand to great advantage. Her husband

-a poor baronet-during courtship, wisely centred all his affections
upon this very small integer of her extensive entirety. In the end
she gave it him, together with a good fortune.
The last class of ugly women require no directions for being
courted, because they take the whole affair out of our hands. They
make up for the want of personal attraction by a certain forwardness
of manner which occasionally gains them so-called lovers, but
seldom husbands. These people can only be hinted at ; they may
not be described.

THE DUKE WHO THINKS ALOUD.
A RoYAL Duke is no more distinguished for the graceful urbanity
with which he presides at any public dinner, given for any purpose,
at any hour, and at any place, than for a constant habit of thinking
aloud. You are in the pit of Covent-Garden theatre : well, five
minutes before the overture begins, you hear a voice above your
head, thus communing with itself.
* Whenever I come to the theatre, I make it a point to dine at
five o'clock !" -
The Royal Duke having addressed this information to his play-
bill, takes his seat, and, throughout the play, keeps up a running
accompaniment of assent or dissent to the speeches entrusted to the
actOrS.
At the Chapel Royal, however, his highness is equally audible, and
equally faithful to his habit of commenting upon all he hears. A
few Sundays ago, the Minister and the Duke proceeded as follows :-
Minister.—From all evil and mischief; from sin, from the crafts of
the devil-
(Duke.—To be sure ; very proper-very proper.)
Minister.—From all sedition, conspiracy, and rebellion-
(Duke.—Certainly ; very right-very right.)
And thus Parson and Duke proceeded together almost to the end.
However, the worthy clergyman had to offer a prayer for the sick.
Proceeding in this pious task, he thus commenced :-
Minister.—The prayers of this congregation are earnestly desired

GRAND NATIONAL PROJECT FOR MORAL AND
INTELLECTUAL ADVANCEMENT.
AN IDEA, BY MR. PUNCH.
ET PUNCH, ever anxious for the pub-
lic good, especially for that of the rising
generation (to promote which he feels
3 to be his mission), and having just de-
sºl vised a most promising scheme for that
E. purpose, earnestly request attention
sº to the following proposal, wherein the
º, said scheme will be unfolded.
The particular object which Mr.
- Punch has in view is the elevation of
ºthe national mind.
- For reasons of his own, but which
will presently be laid before the reader, he is of opinion, that, in
order to raise Man, it is necessary to exalt Woman. The principle,
therefore, which his plan embodies, is “Educate the Fair.”
Verily believing that the existing “seminaries” and “establish-
ments” for young ladies are inadequate to the fulfilment of their pro-
fessed design, Mr. P. proposes that a Female University be forthwith
founded at the expense of the nation.
He recommends as the fittest place for the establishment of such
an institution the Metropolis, and would suggest that a sufficiently
large district, the centre whereof should be Eaton-square, should be
bought up for the purpose—the abode of learning to be entitled “The
University of Pimlico.”
This University shall be constituted as follows:—Its government
shall be vested in a Chancelloress, Vice-Chancelloress, and Senate.
Whether the members of the latter shall be old or young women may
be a question. Analogy, it has been insinuated to Mr. Punch, would
decide in favour of antiquity; but this point can be settled hereafter.
The Executive is to be vested in two Proctoresses—or, perhaps,
half-a-dozen, for two may not be enough. Each Proctoress to be at-
tended by a brace of femineo-taureo-canine bipeds, or bull-dogs in
petticoats—the said creatures to be selected from the swiftest run-
ners for a particular vestment at the yearly revel at Bachelor's Acre.
Each of the Colleges (the number of which will depend upon the
amount of funds raised) shall be presided over by a Mistress, and shall
maintain a society corresponding to the body elsewhere called Fellows.
For the members of this society Mr. Punch proposes the distinctive
appellation of “Wenches;” “Wench” being, to the best of his know
ledge, the feminine equivalent to Fellow.” The word may sound
odd at first ; but that will be nothing when the bearers get used to it.
The Wenchships are to be the reward of merit. For though, in-
deed, “detur pulchriori" is to be the principle whereon all the loaves
and fishes of this establishment are to be disposed of, yet “Handsome
is that handsome does” shall be the criterion of beauty.
Every Wenchship shall afford the holder thereof board and lodging,
and a certain yearly income besides, sufficient to keep her comfort-
ably till she gets married. And a portion of the funds of each
college shall be invested in a certain number of livings, to serve as
dowers to such wenches as may choose to accept of them. Every
wench accepting a living, or taking a husband, to vacate her Wench-
ship of course.
Exhibitions shall likewise be provided for the deserving, and shall
consist of considerable sums of money, to be applied to the purchase
of ball-dresses of the richest magnificence; the gainers of them,
therein duly arrayed, to exhibit their charms, on some appropriate
occasion, at Willis's, or some other fashionable rooms.
The fair students in statu pupillari shall be called Under-Graduates;
and those who have passed their examinations, Spinsters of Arts,
taking, in due time, the degree of Mistress.
No young lady shall be allowed to matriculate under the age of
rteen, or who is unable to read a column of “Punch" with
fluency, and see at least half-a-dozen of the jokes in it; hem a hand-
kerchief, waltz, and play one of Musard's quadrilles to the satisfac-
tion of the examiners. It will be taken for granted that geography,
astronomy and the use of the globes have formed part of the pre-
vious education, and therefore these sciences will not be included in
the course of study pursued at the “University of Pimlico.”
French and Italian as spoken in the fashionable circles, music,
drawing, fancy-work, and the higher branches of dancing, will form
the regular curriculum. A minor examination on these subjects, or a
“little go,” will be instituted before the Spinstership of Arts can be
tried for. The examined shall be able to “go on” anywhere in
“Télémaque,” or in the Conversations in Vénéroni’s Grammar; to
play a fantasia of Thalberg's ; to copy a brigand exactly; to work a
pair of slippers in Berlin wool; and to dance the Cachuca and
Cracovienne. -
NATUR r AND ARt.
For the degree of Spinster, the candidate shall be examined in
various novels by Paul de Kock, Victor Hugo, Balzac, and others;
also in the libretto of the last new opera. She shall be able to play
or sing any of the fashionable pieces or airs of the day, and shall
give evidence of an extensive acquaintance with Bellini, Donizetti,
Labitzky, and Strauss. She shall draw and embroider, in a satis-
factory manner, various fruits, flowers, cottages near a wood, Greeks,
and Mussulmen. Lastly, she shall dance, with correctness and
elegance, a “pas de deux,” with any young gentleman who may be
selected for the purpose.
There shall be likewise, with respect to music and dancing, an
annual examination for honours. The candidates shall evince a
familiarity with the most admirable feats of Taglioni and the
Ellslers, and with the most difficult compositions of Herz, Czerny, and
Bochsa; though if they like they may be allowed to take up, in pre-
ference, Handel, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, and Weber.
These examinations shall be called respectively the Musical and the
Dancing Tripos. No one shall be admissible to the latter who has
not taken honours in the former. The gradations of distinction shall
be as follows:–In the Musical Tripos the foremost damsel shall be
entitled the Senior Warbler; next shall follow the Simple Warblers;
the Bravissimas shall come next ; then the Bravas; and finally those
who barely get their degree.
The first dancer shall be denominated La Sylphide ; after her shall
be ranked the Sylphs; next to these the first and second Coryphées;
and lastly, as before, the merely passable.
Professorships of Sentiment, Flirtation, Poonah-Painting, and
Cookery, shall also be established, and young ladies permitted to “go
out” in these sciences; taking the degree of Doctress.
Mr. Punch has already mentioned certain books which he pro-
poses to have read. These, it may be urged, contain various objec-
tionable passages, which, therefore, ought to be expunged. But as no
such operation is performed on Horace and Juvenal at other places,
whereat, too, the majority of the students are brought up to be
clergymen, the precaution is, in his opinion, unnecessary.
What shall be the academical costume, Mr. Punch would leave
to be settled by competent authority; he suggests, by the Mistress of
the Robes. Gowns, of course, the students will all wear; but he, for
his own part, objects to caps. He would likewise have an express
statute erected against all manner of boots.
Now, Mr. Punch contends, that by the workings of the proposed
institution, refinement, intelligence, and morality would soon become
diffused over the kingdom. His reasons for anticipating so much from
the cultivation of the female mind are briefly these :—
In all countries where women are degraded, men are debased.
The Turks, who maintain that ladies have no souls, keep them shut
up out of society in a harem,- and are great blockheads for
their pains.
Hottentots, all the world over, as well as in their peculiar piggery,
treat women as inferior creatures; whereby they make great brutes
of themselves.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Old Bachelors in general have a strong affinity with the ursine
tribes. -
Men fall in love for lack of wit, by an ordinance of Nature for sup-
plying the deficiency. A lout who turns lover diminishes in density
to a remarkable extent; and many a Cymon puts off the Yahoo
under the influence of an Iphigenia.
Besides, it is clear that if you civilise the better half of mankind,
you go more than half way to improve the whole.
In conclusion, Mr. Pu Nch recommends that a petition for the
establishment of an institution such as he has above described be pre-
sented forthwith to the House of Commons, and that the same be
intrusted for presentation to the hands of Mr. Thomas Duncombe.
Should the proposed plan obtain the sanction of Government, Mr. P.
will be too happy to undertake any office involving the management
of pecuniary affairs which may arise out of it. And in the mean
time, if any gentleman or lady desirous of founding a college will
transmit the where withal, in the shape of a handsome cheque or ex-
tensive conveyance to his office, it shall be taken every care of.

He sat alone in the dark recess
Of his chamber's silent gloom,
And the dreary ghost of brieflessness
Stalk’d up and down the room.
His gown was hanging upon a hook,
And its dark, mysterious fold,
By the twilight dim, in his fancy, took
The form of the one call'd old.
His wig, unworn for many a day,
Was slumbering in its box,
And the busy spider work'd away
In its stiffly-curling locks.
His bands had assumed a yellow hue,
As they lay untouch'd in his drawer;
And the white cravat was tawny, too
Of this hapless man of law.
He threw his feet upon the hobs
Of his dingy black-leaded grate,
And instinctively counted the small steel knobs,
Which he found amounted to eight.
He threw himself back in his one-arm chair–
An odd one he'd bought in the street;
And he plaintively whistled a well-known air,
Beating time on the hobs with his feet.
And was it for this, he mournfully thought,
That I've kept my terms in the hall,
And spent some hundreds in being taught,
Besides what I've paid for my call 2
Oh! was it for this that I've read on trust—
Remainders too and uses,
While nothing comes in to pay for the crusts,
Though my baker to trust refuses *
'Twas thus he thought, when a gentle knock
Was heard at his chamber door,
And through his heart there ran a shock,
For it told him of many a score.
But hunger gives courage to the hare,
And makes it cease to run ;
And brieflessness bids the barrister dare
To boldly face a dun.
He rush'd to the portal—-that man of law,
In a fit of desperation,
And received—oh joy! instructions to dres
At once a declaration.
He open'd them—oh ! can language tell
The sight he saw within P
His countenance from its first smile fell
Into a ghastly grin.
The paper indorsed “Instr'ons"—a phrase
Which is for “Instructions” short,
Dispay’d to that lawyer's earnest gaze,
Not anything of the sort.
But quickly there met his eager eye
Of parchment a little bit;
He found himself served—and a witness by,
With—A copy of a wait !

THE GREAT BAZAAR SMASH.
F course everybody knows the Bazaars at
the watering-places, where the visitor from
London occasionally makes one of a small
party of four or three—as the case may be
—in a desperate effort to obtain what is
º called a “sweepstakes” of a two-
shilling ticket, to get which you are plea-
santly told that you “risk * sixpence,—
though the “risk” is a very close resem-
blance to certainty, inasmuch as if you are
fortunate enough to win the sweepstakes once
in fifty times, it is certain that every time in
the whole fifty, you put down the sixpence,
and never get it back gaain. The “risk” is
- in winning, but the “certainty” is in losing;
- - and though the possession of the “sweep-
stakes” is at all times apocryphal, the total disappearance of the sixpence
is as unvariable as if it were “a law of nature,” instead of a regulation of
the bazaar-keeper. -
It was in the August of 1838, when the writer of this article was walking
down the High-street of , amid the bows of the proprietors of the
bathing-rooms—none of whom he had ever patronised—when his eye was
arrested by an individual at a doorway, rattling some dice furiously in an
ivory box, and exclaiming with a tone of agonising earnestness, that he
“only wanted one.” - The writer of this article, being naturally of an
inquiring mind, stopped opposite the premises, and began to peruse a
written placard, in which it was announced that there would be a concert
at twelve, to which the admission was in the most liberal spirit, and in
order to meet the views of a discerning public, most appropriately fixed at
—nothing. The following was the bill of fare—or programme, as it was
rather ambitiously called—of the concert alluded to.

a permanent engagement with the extremely venerable grandfather of the highly-
talented and unprecedentedly popular Miss Snoozle, who will appear every day
and night until further notice, and will on Monday play a Concerto on the Double-
Drums, introducing the beautiful Motivo “Not a Drum was heard,” composed
expressly for Sir John Moore by a late eminent Musician.
The evening start.
The writer of this article perused the above bill with considerable
interest, and entered into conversation with the individual who still stood
shaking the dice-box violently at the door, and reiterating in a voice that
trembled with emotion, “One only wanted!” It was obvious that the in-
dividual was looking with considerable anxiety up the street, as if he ex-
pected some one ; but whether it was the “only one wanted" he was
looking for, or whether “the one wanted” was himself, the writer of this
article could not then ascertain, though subsequent events developed the
fact that the “One Wanted” was the bazaar-keeper, and that numerous
indeed were those, who wanted him.
when taken to BE well, shaken.
But we must not anticipate the Great Bazaar Smash; we will
therefore enter the concert-room, on a table of which was laid a paper
waiting to be filled up with fifty subscribers at two shillings each,
and announcing that the highest thrower would be entitled to any
article worth five pounds in the library. Had an observer looked round
the premises, he would have perceived at once that the condition of
the raffle could only be fulfilled by distraining on the square piano,
the rout seats, the register stove, and the chandelier, which all to-
gether might have made up the value of five pounds, that the highest
thrower was declared to be entitled to. The exertions of Mr. Thump on
the square piano left no time, however, for reflection to any of the visi-
tors; and when Miss Snoozle tripped on to the platform, followed by her
grandfather, for the performance of “My feelings to a lath still waste
me,” there was a pause in the rattling of the dice, and the bazaar-keeper
stood silently but not inactively at the door, straining his eyes through a
one and ninepenny pocket telescope. The subject of a contemplated
raffle of 12 subscribers at sixpence each—and evidently still deeply im-
pressed with the feeling that there was “one wanted,” the song went off
pleasantly, and the venerable Mr. Snoozle's obligato on the trombone was
rendered amusing, if not effective, by the necessity of opening the window
to give scope to the occasional elongation of his instrument, which, in some
of the notes, was extended to the very verge of the railing of the balcony.
Let its pass over the comic song and the finale to Part 2, in which Mr.
Thump completely sported with the ponderous ophycleide, and produced

-
After a fine autumn evening came a delicious autumn morning, and the
writer of this article, in the costume of the place, considerably heightened
in its picturesque appearance by a camp-stool, a telescope, and a novel, was
again in the High-street of he gay tones of the piano were still
issuing from the Library door, and the trombone was still popping in and
out, according to the exigencies of the music, of the Library window. But
to make short of a long story, the bazaar-keeper was no longer to be seen,
but his apprentice brandished the dice-box in his master's place, and des-
perately entreated the assembled visitors to take “a chance” in the
raffle. Another day came, and the musicians were still in attendance,
but the apprentice was gone, and the dice-box had passed into the hands
of the acting member of a committee of creditors, who had met for the
purpose of saving what they called the “wreck” of the property. Still was
the cry raised of “I want but one;” and true it was, for the Great Bazaar
had come to a smash, and the proprietor had bolted. When the news
spread, people poured in with tickets which they had been saving up until
the promised new fancy stock came in, out of which a choice could be
made ; but the stock was so entirely a fancy one, that it was never
rendered tangible. The concert was, however, repeated to the end of the
week, for the provisional committee guaranteed the salaries up to Satur-
day night; and in the intervals of Mr. Snoozle's trombone-playing, anxious
inquiries might be heard as to what there would be for the holders of
tickets. Many who had obtained a few shillings'-worth (?) by an outlay—
facetiously called a risk—of a few pounds, were told they might “come in
and prove under the commission;” but most of them were anxious to see
the proprietor, whose words were still ringing in their ears, and who con-
tinued to keep up the beautiful allegory of ONE WANTED.
* A voice FROM THE GRAVE!”
The Marquis of HERtford, though dead, is still audible. Albeit
the man of millions moulders in his shroud, a voice—a sweet melo-
dious utterance—is heard through lead and oak, and velvet covering;
a voice which Mr. THEsigER, the retained interpreter for the occa-
sion, avows to be “a voice from the grave,” declaratory of the moral
excellence of Nicholas SuissE, late PANDARus and treasurer in the
affairs of Venus to the rotting Marquis From amidst worms and
corruption is heard the “soft still voice of humanity,” proclaiming
Nicholas Suisse to be “a most excellent man 1"
“Only the actions of the just
Smell sweet and blossom in the dust,”
says the Poet, in the solemnity of deepest inspiration. We may add—
“A lordling's voice, though from the grave,
A pander and a — shall save!”
It is most gratifying to know, that the Marquis of HERtford,
appearing in his grave-clothes in the Old Bailey, has, by the ingenuity
of a lawyer, been permitted to “speak to the character” of an innocent
and much-abused valet. Mors loquitur—a voice is heard from the
charnel-house—and Nicholas SuissE, falsely accused of robbery to
only the amount of 100,000 francs, quits the bar without a stain upon
his name I Sweetly will the Marquis repose within his tomb, having
by his “voice from the grave” rescued a faithful and deserving
servant from the hulks. How, indeed, could his Lordship have en-
joyed Paradise, knowing that Nicholas Suisse, who had ministered
so devotedly to his earthly pleasures, toiled on Norfolk Island
The sympathy displayed by Lord ABINGER towards the accused is
touching, yet not less delightful than the affecting style in which his
Lordship paints the infirmities of the late Marquis; infirmities un-
ceasingly alleviated by Nicholas Suisse. Hear Justice, ermined
Justice, discoursing from the judgment-seat:—
“The prisoner, there could be no doubt, had been an invaluable servant
to his master, and it was his duty to provide liberally for him under the
circumstances.”
Again :-
“Very important and valuable services had been performed since No-
vember, 1839, and it was only right to infer that for such services his
master would reward him.” “His character was described, in what the
learned counsel most properly called “a voice from the grave of his master"
(Lord Hertford's will), as being that of “a most excellent man.' There
could be no doubt of the ercellence of his character.”
Lord ABINGER's conviction of the delicate services of SuissE was
doubtless formed upon the evidence of a fellow-servant of the pri-
soner, named Foot E :—
“I was in the habit of attending about the person of the Marquis
during the last four years, The prisoner was his chief attendant
and acted as his steward, in fact, he was the house steward -
The Marquis was very much attached to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
was in the habit of having females at his residence, and he was also in the
habit of travelling on the Continent with them. The prisoner had the
management of all those delicate affairs. No other person was employed
about such aſſairs. The Marquis was not able to go about without assist-
ance during the last years of his life - Some of the females
above alluded to were in the habit of visiting the Marquis at Dorchester-
house up to the time of his death. A female, called Henriette, was in the
house at the time of the Marquis's death. There was a back entrance to
the house through which the ladies entered at night and left in the morning.”
Some of these “ladies” were, doubtless, women of high intel-
lectual qualifications, and of great natural wit; and the Marquis was,
of course, deeply indebted to the intelligence of a servant who could
purvey so judiciously for the moral recreation and improvement of
his lord. We have, by the way, heard an anecdote of one of these
ladies, which is an unanswerable evidence of her strong religious
feelings, and which proves her to be a fitting comforter for a noble in
his passing hour. On the morning of the decease of the Marquis, the
sun shone gloriously abroad; approaching the window, the lady ob-
served—“A fine morning, my lord, to go to”—
- - - - ** A dark
Illimitable ocean without bound.”—Milton.
Now, the Marquis of HERtford was certainly the best judge of
what, in his mind ; constituted “an excellent man,” and Nicholas
Suisse, by the “delicate services” (so saith Lord Ahi NgER), rendered
to his master, proving himself a beau idéal of human excellence, was
the small sum of 100,000 francs too little to bestow on that surpassing
rarity
If the Marquis of II ent fond can really look down from his starry
home, how great must be his gratitude to his executors . His Lordship's
reputation was well known, and doubtless highly appreciated in his im-
mediate circle – in the circle embracing the ARINGERs and haute noblesse
—but it had not become matter of newspaper celebrity, to be discussed
in every tap-room and beer-shop throughout the kingdom. His Lord-
ship's executors have now, however, done a singular good to society.
They have shown, upon one hand, the fidelity of a servant, the con-
stant intelligence that kept watch and ward at “the back entrance
of Dorchester House,” where “ladies entered at night and left in the
morning”—and they have also exhibited—(in this ungrateful world,
most rare exhibition )—the gratitude of the great towards the devo-
tion of the humble !
In legal history, we have met with witnesses who, intent upon vin-
dicating the innocence of the falsely accused, have been brought even
from their dying beds to speak a good word for the man at the bar.
In the case of Suisse, how much more touching the scene ! For have
we not the executors of HEntroRD compelled, by their first step, to
bring the dead Marquis into court, that the mortal rottenness may
“give a character to the prisoner,” that the loathsome dead may
declare the greater loathsomeness of the living The corpse—
opening its decaying jaws, cries—“A most excellent man "
“A voice from the grave ſ” exclaims Mr. Thesigen.
“The moral music of the dead "cries Lord ABINGER.
THE NEW BiSHOPS.
At the late consecration of the five bishops (for exportation) to Barba-
does, Gibraltar and Malta, Van Diemen's Land, Antigua, and Guiana, the
crowd was correspondingly great with the event. We, however, only no-
tice the ceremony to record a most gratifying circumstance that arose out
of it. A lesson was read (as being most pertinent to the occasion) from
Acts xx. ; from which we make the following extract:—
“I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel : yea, ye yourselves
know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them
that were with me.”
As these words fell upon the ears of the Bishops elect, it was delight-
ful to behold the sudden radiancy of their countenances. Barbadoes
smiled upon Gibraltar and Malta—Van Diemen's Land looked graciously
at Antigua–whilst Guiana, with a meekness full of the Apostie, seemed
inwardly digesting the words of Paul. Such was the influence of the
lesson, “from Acts xx,” that, on quitting the Abbey, the five bishops
immediately addressed a letter to the proper authorities, voluntarily fore-
going so much of their salaries as might otherwise have been laid out on
garriages, and liveries (we have never yet been able to discover the
heraldic bearings of John the Baptist), requiring only as much as
would suffice for decent living; and further resolving, with their own
hands to minister occasionally unto their necessities, and to those of their
congregations.
Why is thcro such honour amongst thieves *- Because they generally hang
together.

THE PREWALENT DISTURBANCES.
Accounts from the back parlours of the Islington Millinery districts,
speak with great apprehension of the excited state of the flies in that
quarter. Our own reporter, Miss Pippy, of Barnsbury Road, informs us
that large bands of these restless insects are beginning to assemble on her
ceiling, whose movements betoken much activity; and it is rumoured that
there has been a turn-out of wasps from the grocer's opposite. She has
twice been obliged to resort to the intervention of the pelisse, which she
was making, and which has dispersed them for a time; but should they
collect again, it will be necessary to call out the knotted handkerchief,
under the command of her brother.
A determined attack has just been made on a piece of apple core on the
table ; and there appears to have been a large “demonstration” upon the
frame of the looking-glass. An agitating blue-bottle is evidently the excit-
ing cause of the hubbub, and he has just been stopping a mill between two
refractory flies who were quarrelling over a crumb, which he has, in the
manner of other agitators, appropriated to himself.

And I rear my humble head
With an air and a mien so exceedingly shy,

And forced out of very shame to run—
The Hollyhock won’t, though the Sunflower may.
I would not be a Sunflower bold,
That out of countenance Phoebus stares,
For all the vulgar yellow gold
That in its blossoms it proudly wears,
No, I'd rather be the modest flower
That l know I am, and I love to be,
Than the gayest plant that decks the bower:
Where fairies trip and mortals take tea.
They shall not make of me a show,
As of other flowers they often do,
At the Gardens of the Surrey Zo-
Or as others call them, the Surrey Zoo.
No, I scorn the Dahlia standing so bold,
To be view'd by the crowd in a vulgar pot 5

PUNCH2S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER VII.--THE HERMIT'S “PHILOSOPHY"—Conti Nurd.
How pure this atmosphere ! How sweet, with opening lungs and
in-drawn chest, to take a long, deep, bacchanal draught of midnight
air, cool from the stars and odorous with May 1 With not a taint of
urban smoke—with not the fever-heat of corroding mortal life—to
infect the soul with maladies of which men daily die, albeit doctors
dream not of the true disease How grand at this moment to hear,
in the profound of night, the heart of the earth beat—beat towards
eternity : To feel a new affection, as we recognize a new life—closer
sympathies with all that presses upon us . To lose our old habitual
eyes, that blink dreamily at common-place—with true vision ; to
see spirits ascending and descending from every blade and leaf; and
with ears tuned to the most secret melody of Nature—that like a
happy housewife, sings as she toils—list the working of that vast
laboratory compassed in yon giant oak
We can do more. Drop through the earth, and, with strengthening
heart and health-obtaining brain, look face to face at Death, and see
a new-found beauty in his barren bones. We can scan him, talk to
him, and see a thousand curious beauties—odd, grave blandishments,
in the abused wight; the worthy creature, wronged in our half-
knowledge, slandered in the malice of our ignorance. What filthy
names—when the broad sun was shining upon us, and we were
laughing in the glory of a new doublet and jerkin—have we spat
upon him How have we mauled him, when we have thought of his
wicked will with cousin Bridget—a red-lipped creature with the
breath of a heifer How did we rate him for a wretch, a beast,
a monster dining upon heart-strings—an ogre that blotted out
the beauty of the sun—that put a poison into the violet's leaf-
that turned all gracious and all lovely things to hideous, ghastly
masquerade 1–How did we clench our fist, and stamp at him, as,
with reeling brain and bursting heart, we stood at thy grave—Oh,
ADMET Us!—and wished ourselves a clod of the valley, to mingle
with thy bones!
Fortune is called harlot every hour of the day, and that, too, by
grave gentlemen who only abuse the wench before company because
they have never known her private favours. Bad as she is, however,
let sour-faced Seneca and all the other philosophers of the vinegar-
cruet stalk with paper-lanterns before her door, they will never bring
the romping hoyden into ill repute. No ; she will still be visited,
prayed to, cajoled, flattered; and when she plays a jilt's trick, will
be abused as lustily as ever. Yet, what is this universal abuse—this
polyglot reviling—for fortune is damned by all colours and in all
tongues—to the foul, ungrateful, scandalous, mean-spirited, shabby,
aye, and hypocritical, abuse of Death?
Oh, no do not believe what is said of Death. All folks abuse him,
and therefore, if for nothing else, out of the very chivalry of your
nature—shake hands with him. No-not hands; that, for a few
years at least, is a little too near. But there—give him the end of
your walking-stick, and let him shake that. Well done! Now, look
at him. Hath he not been scurvily limned The dirty portrait-
painters of the world, learning that the good fellow had so many
enemies, have villanously libelled him. Should you recognise, in
the fine benevolence now smiling upon you—and surely no chamber-
lain, with finger on his golden key, ever looked a visitor a sweeter
welcome—should you see, in the frank hospitality before you, the
sneaking, haggard, noiseless stabber, painted by a million brushes
Is he not all over—gentleman Behold his face—his frame 1 Hath
he not the countenance of Adonis, with perhaps a somewhat down-
ward look? The outline of an Apollo? He carries a dart. It is no
vulgar implement—no piece of torturing cold iron, to pierce and
grope in human bowels, but an arrow from the quiver of Eternal
Day. It has been used so much in this thick-dew world, that, to
the filmy eyes of men, it has lost its brightness; but it is not so : the
immortal ray is under the rust. The meanest, the scurviest abuse
has been cast upon all-suffering Death. Not one fair gift has been
left him. Even the sweetness of his breath has been traduced.
Now, madam—nay, put aside your smelling-bottle, and fearlessly
approach. There! Death breathes. Is it not an air from Elysium ?
Amaranth, madam-amaranth !
We are content to take up the abuse of the world as truthful
censure—to believe in the hard sayings flung in the teeth of Death
as well-earned reproach. We condemn him by hearsay; and join in
the halloo of an unthinking, ignorant mob. But invite Death to a
tête-à-tête : divesting yourself of vulgar prejudice, sit down in a
place like this—for you are in my hermitage, reader—and calmly
and dispassionately chat with him, and you will find the fine old
fellow to have been villamously maligned—shamefully scandalized.
You will, to your own surprise, and no less comfort, discover in
Death the noblest benefactor—the staunchest, truest friend. All the
naughty things you have heard of him will seem to you as the gossip
of cowards—the malice of fools. All the foul paraphernalia—the
shroud, the winding-sheet, the wet heavy clay, the worm and corrup-
tion at which serious gentlemen shake their heads, and talk for an
hour upon, have no more to do with you than with the hare that may
nibble the grass above what once was yours; no more touch you
than they touch the red-faced urchins making chains of buttercups
and daisies on a falsifying tomb-stone. When moralizing word-
mongers seize you by the button, and holding up a skull or old earth-
smelling tibia to your eye, look straight down their noses, and tell
you that in a short time you will be no more than that they thrust
in your face, tell them, with all reverence, they lie. What will
your skull, your bones, be to you, more than your corn that was cut
out on Thursday—more than that vile double-tooth which, having
tortured you for a fortnight, was, a week since, lugged out of your
jaw, and left at the dentist's It is the vile literalness of people's
brains that gives an unhandsomeness to the dead bones of men ; that
makes them in the grave a part and parcel of the sentient thing ;
that would make their foulness and disgrace a humiliation to the
soaring man. You shew me his lordship's cast-off court-suit of tar-
nished silver: that it is cast-off, proves to me that he has possessed
himself of a better. Show me the skull of a dead philosopher, nay,
of a defunct pickpocket; commence a dumpish morality on the
terrible change of head undergone by sage or thief, and I shall reply
to you—It is excellent that it is so ; for, depend upon it, the change
is for the better; he has obtained a much handsomer article.
The truth is, we have made too much a mystery of the common-
places of Death : we have made scarecrows of skeletons, instead of
looking upon them with a sort of respect—as we look upon the hat,
coat, and breeches of one we once loved—of one who once wore the
articles that were a necessary part of his dress for this world, but
that in fact never made any portion of that thing, that essence, which
we knew as he. You say, that was his thigh-bone : very well—this
was his walking-stick. Bone or cane, one was as much of him as the
other: he is alike independent of both. I deny that he is changed—
that his dignity is in the remotest degree compromised, because
his human furniture is nailed in a box, and crammed in a hole. You
might as well preach upon the disgrace of walking-sticks, because our
friend's bit of dragon's blood, after sundry domestic revolutions, has
been cut into a dibber. To make a death's-head horrible—to preach
from its pretended loathsomeness a lesson to the pride of humanity
—to extract from it terrors to the spirit of man, whilst yet consorted
with flesh and blood, the churchyard moralist should prove that the
skull remains the ghastly, comfortless prison of the soul, that, for a
certain time, it is ordained its blank and hideous dungeon. Then,
indeed, would a death's-head be horrible; then would it appala heart
of stone and ribs of steel. But, good sexton-preacher, when now you
show me a skull, what do I look upon The empty shell, through
which the bird has risen to the day. We libel the sanctity of Death,
when we dress it in artificial terrors. We profane it, when, applying
a moral galvanism to its lineaments, we make it mope and mow at
the weak and credulous.
I have learned this in my hermitage—learned it, sitting cheek by
jowl with Death, talking over his doings, and deeply contemplating
the loveliness of his attributes.
A SENTIMENTAL SONNET to A SICK ELEPHANT.
(Intended for the Metropolitan.)
Monarch of forests 1 o'er thy hide the wind,
That roves the scented groves of fair Ceylon,
Has swept and circled ! Now for ever gone
Those hours . And “cabin'd, crib'd, confined"
Within a narrow cage—a caravan
As narrow as thy native woods were wild,
Thou art cooped up—strong wooden bars inside—
And made to know “the majesty of man!”
And thou art sick no wonder: Thy great heart
Sighs over recollections of the past—
Mourns that thy sad captivity must last
Till death shall come and snap thy bars apart 1
Well may’st thou feel the sickness of despair,
In this emetic-gamboge-coloured air!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON IDLER.
chapTER x1. –The visitor to London (continued).
Whethen he discovers his friend or not, nothing can exceed the
ardour with which the visitor gives himself up to sight-seeing; for
it is chiefly upon folks from the country that the exhibitions depend.
In town everybody is too much occupied with his own affairs to
run after shows; but the visitor sees the accounts of them in the
newspapers, and rushes up to behold them. No sense of weariness
stops him. The dioramas, cosmoramas, panoramas, and kaloramas,
give him the ubiquitous power of being in every quarter of the globe
at once. China, Cabool, Rome, Hamburg, and Waterloo, are all
visited within four-and-twenty hours. He revels amongst the dusty
wonders of the British Museum ; he makes the tours of the rival
Zoological Gardens, and walks round all the squares; he goes over
the Tower, and finishes each day at one of the theatres; until his
head gets so confused with the whirl of objects, that in a short time
he is happy to enter the terminus of the railway once more, on his
way home, laden with all sorts of curious rubbish.
It is not because the visitor to London has a mere thirst for sight-
seeing, that he takes such indefatigable pains ; but he thinks of the
future—of his return to his country town—of the wonder he shall
excite amongst the aborigines of his locality, by detailing the strange
things that he has witnessed. We have stated that the retrospection
is better than the voyage ; we might have added, that people travel
not so much for the sake of travelling itself, as to talk afterwards of
what they have seen, and to show that they are not behind their
neighbours. On the same plan, the smoker does not delight so much
in the flavour of his cigar, in spite of all he may say to the contrary,
as in the pleasure of puffing the light-blue vapour from his mouth,
and watching it rise and curl so capriciously in the air. This must
be the reason why, with few exceptions, blind people do not smoke,
and dumb people do not travel.
If the visitor ever experiences a mortification, it is when he hears
some sight spoken of in the country which he did not see whilst he
was in London. And this is a plan which certain wicked wits make
use of to cut short any overdone description the visitor may be in-
dulging in. For example: the visitor is amusing a gaping crowd
with a long detail of the Thames Tunnel; a jocular auditor, who also
knows London, inquires if he does not think the tunnel from the Old
Bailey to Bloomsbury-square, under Holborn-hill, far superior to
Brunel's undertaking.
This certainly is a question to take a man aback. It would put
him out of countenance had he the diplomatic impenetrability of
Talleyrand, or the “London Assurance” of Cool, when he says with
such unflinciting audacity, “No, sir; that's not Master Charles.”
“The Holborn-hill tunnel !” exclaims the visitor timidly.
“Yes, to be sure,” returns his pleasant friend; “most undoubtedly
the grandest work in London.”
After a few hesitating seconds, the visitor, determined not to be
outdone, will probably affirm that he has seen the tunnel in question,
and that it is a most magnificent monument of human perseverance 1
And, by the way, it is a good plan, generally speaking, if you have
told a lie in company, to stick to it, come what may. Not less useful
to your progress in society is it, to make up your mind never to be
outdone by a boaster. If such-a-one says, with an air of superiority,
that he keeps a yacht, directly affirm that you have a man of war of
your own private property. It is equally serviceable to drop as much
below the mark as to soar above it; and when you hear a “fine” man
at an evening party lamenting aloud that “his fellow has not brought
his cab,” be very polite, and tell him you expect your private truck
every moment, when part of it is entirely at his service.
The visitor, although he has seen the principal objects of interest
in the Metropolis, including the House of Lords and Bethlehem—the
House of Commons and St. Luke's—the saloons of the theatres,
and cemeteries of the suburbs—the banquet at Guildhall, and the
beasts feeding at the Zoological Gardens, &c., &c., is still desirous of
viewing something else; and finding he has been to the top of every
practicable elevation in London, commences his descending excur.
sions, and visits the Magic Cave, the Dock wine-vaults, and the
diving bell at the Polytechnic, concluding, as a grand coup, by going
up and down, and head over heels, all at once, in the car of the Cen.
trifugal Railway.
Of course, the visitor does not see all these marvels without a pro-
portionate outlay, and a corresponding loss of innumerable pocket-
handkerchiefs and uncounted umbrellas. Inhabitants of the rural
districts, when in town, are fair game for everybody to victimise, and
resemble pigeons that have got out of bounds at the Red House.
Everywhere the stranger has the chance, as he thinks, of proving
himself a shrewd man of business, by yielding to the confidential
address of some great tobacco-merchant in disguise, whom he
meets in the streets, and who whispers to him that “he has
a few good Awanners if he wants any.” He is doomed to be again
taken in. After following the merchant down a back street, up a court,
and into some small room, the approach to which lies over a water-
butt, along a wooden gutter and through a trap-door, he is frightened
out of his wits by sundry threats, and compelled to purchase an
indefinite number of small dingy cylinders, formed of cabbage-leaves
boiled in tobacco-juice and apocryphally termed cigars.
The visitor may think himself fortunate if he gets a friend to
accompany him ; but he is ten times more so if this friend is not
one of those uncomfortable quizzers we have before alluded to, for
the stranger is always an easy victim to their pleasantries. His inex
perience and eager desire to learn everything throw him completely
at the mercy of his friend.
The quizzer and his companion, for example, are walking down
Regent Street.
“You see that tall dark man with a large beard and mustachios, in
at Very's eating ices t” says the Londoner.
“Precisely so—with the lavender gloves.”
“Well—that's Charles Dickens—“Boz, you know.”
“Bless me !” exclaims the provincial: “I must see him closer.”
And he directly rushes into Very's, and eats three ices, which give
him the stomach-ache, for the pleasure, as he imagines, of sitting near
the celebrated author.
He has scarcely left the shop when his friend tells him the dirty
‘little unknown' is the Duke of Brunswick, and next points out an-
other small man with red hair, and no whiskers, as Count D'Orsay,
immediately afterwards showing him Sir Robert Peel, Jullien, Cerito,
and Dr. Pusey, all in one hackney-coach.
It is needless to add how highly delighted the visitor feels, upon
returning home, at having been fortunate enough to see so many cele-
brated characters in the short space of one stroll.
THE PENNY-A-LINE PANIC.
Our accounts this week are on the whole rather encouraging, and the
penny-a-liners are in some places returning to their work, though there
are still gangs of miserable beings going about who would gladly turn out
all the hands if they had the opportunity of getting their own feet into the
offices.
In the neighbourhood of the Lane there is still a good deal of discon-
tent, but an “alarming accident” went in last night, and at the Herald
office, if things go on at their present rate, there is every reason to expect
a “distressing suicide.” The spinners of heavy goods have most of them
gone in, and there is the usual quantity of yarn being spun every day;
while the production of the raw article goes on at the same rate as here-
tofore. A policeman is parading Catherine-street nearly all day to pro-
tect such of the penny-a-liners as are willing to resume their work, but
everything in the neighbourhood continues dull and gloomy.
The hands are in full employ on the coarse stuffs, and some attempts
have been made to proceed with an article of a finer quality; but the stuff
was so thick and woolly, that nothing could be done with it.

LOVE AND MONEY.
BY
A BARRISTER of long standix G.
“O Love . " or, 'tis synonymous, “O Gold . "
“0 landed property 1"—who says that love
Of country is not strong as 'twas of old 2
Of country-seats, and—“settlements '''-We shove
Love without cash away ; and, up above,
Affection hovers, driven from below—
Save only now and then, when, like a dove,
She comes and broods o'er some lone pair, who know
The world not as it is, but as 'twas long ago!
Love has retired from business, and has sold
His trade, and the “good-will of it,” to Mammon,
That he may use it but for getting gold,
Keeping it pack'd in ice—as they do salmon.
Love's bought and sold. Give —Now-a-days?—give 2–gammon I
The bare idea of it is absurd
Now Doctors' Commons is the oracular Ammon—
Or some mysterious whisperings are heard,
Told by that unseen tale-bearer—“a little bird "
'Tis said, that folks now “love” in youth alonc-
'Tis said, age teaches them a great deal better;
Time's petrifying process turns to stone
The heart—we leave the spirit for the letter—
Calling men shade and substance l—as a fetter
Is marriage look’d upon ; good, if it can
Keep fears of gaols and bailiffs from the debtor;
And so he marries money—calls it “Anne"—
To all the world !—which calls him “happy man "
But is Love flown from earth; or, does he rest
..Secure in some bright region far away
Resting on nature's all uncultured breast,
More beautiful because uncultured, may
It be that love now dwells not where the ray
Of eyes that have been civilised do shine?
An “animal propensity” deem they
That love is not a thing for them to twine
Around their hot-press'd hearts so extra superfine.
Ah! Love is gone to “somewhere "—But comes back
Just now and then—pops in on us to see
If there is aught for him to do—Alack 1
There is not much, so soon again does he
Take to his wings, and to his hiding glee.
Perchance he takes a short nap with “the Seven,”
Just for the sake of having company—
Or he perchance is fled away to Heaven
To play pranks with St. Ursula's Eleven :

From the Observer's own Correspondent.
The preparations for the winter campaign at the Flower Saloon are on
a very extensive scale, and we have heard it whispered that a flute is to
be added to the four violins that now comprise the orchestra. It would
seem from this, that the manager will throw his main strength into the
musical departinent; an opinion which is partly corroborated by a ru-
mour that the “second assassin” of the company has received the
usual week's notice. . The “heavy father” has been already discharged,
and a treaty is said to be pending with a “singing villain” of provin-
cial celebrity. Of course, if the manager thinks the second assassin
can be spared, and that the singing villain will draw him money, he
is quite right in throwing the heavy father overboard.
A piece of domestic interest was read in the green-room of the Gaff
in the New Cut on Monday last, when the º heroine of
domestic drama fainted away, and the interesting highwayman went
into strong hysterics at the affecting nature of the incidents. There
is one scene in which a murder is on the point of being discovered,
when the perpetrator, to avoid detection, swallows the dagger in the
face of the audience. This is ingeniously managed, by Ramo Samee
taking for an instant the place of the “recognised tragedian,” who
enacts the part of the murderer.

MR. Tomkins leaves his official residence next Saturday evening for
Gravesend. He will return on Monday morning, in time for the despatch
of business.
Among the passengers by the Era to Richmond on Sunday last, we
observed Mr. Smith and family, Mr. Jones and family, Mr. Brown and
no family, together with several other similarly distinguished individuals.
As the vessel passed under the Hammersmith Suspension Bridge the
chimney was lowered half-mast high, as a tribute of respect and sympathy
for the bereaved shareholders.
The outward-bound omnibusses are crowded with passengers, and an
immense number of persons were brought down Regent Street by the
“Atlas,” which, after touching at Charing-Cross, where the crew took in
beef and provisions, went on to the Elephant.
Among the Fashionable Departures we have to notice that of Mr. Timkins,
who left Whetstone Park for the Baths in the York road, but it is not ex-
pected that his stay would be long, as he took with him no part of his do-
mestic establishment but the jack towel.
Lambeth continues very gay, and the chief amusement of the place has
been the new-lettering of the board announcing the fares of the steamboats,
a ceremony that has every day attracted a select circle of visitors. The
laying of the first stone of the new pavement opposite the Palace, has
also added much to the gaieties of this rapidly rising watering-place. The
illness of the Archbishop has not interfered with the soirées at the public-
house opposite.

PHAETON DRIVING THE CHARIOT
OF THE SUN.
-
I.
The poets have told
How Phaeton made bold
To say to his daddy Apollo—
If you'll lend me your nags,
I'll soon show, blow my rags |
There's no dragsman but I can beat hollow.
II.
His dad gave consent,
And off the boy went,
But the tits took to bolt, and surprised him ;
And there's not the least doubt
We had all been “burnt out
Had not Jupiter kindly capsized him.
III.
So take care, Master Bob,
It's a ticklish job
To manage the team you have chosen,
And if you contrive
To continue your drive
why I'll say—you're a man of a dozen :
THE NATURAL HISTORY OF COURTSHIP.
cIIAPTER x.-ox THE ART OF MAKING THE ROMANTIC.
The pleasing possessor of “mind,” “soul,” “intense sensibility,”
“exquisite sentiment,” “soaring imagination,” forms (provided she
have a few thousands a year to tempt the undertaking) a fit and
facile subject for the arts of courtship.
Romantic women are as susceptible of conquest as ugly ones are
difficult to be won. This is to be accounted for from the well-known
fact that nobody is so easy to deceive as an habitual deceiver; and as
it is the business of sentimental women's lives to persuade the world
that they are infinitely superior to the rest of their sex—so they
are peculiarly open to the same kind of deception when prac-
tised upon themselves by male admirers. Now, although a man
cannot become at will a gentleman, a wit, a scholar, or a lord, yet he
is able on the shortest notice to get up a set of superfine feelings—
to be continually rapt in the delicious mystics of romance—to ape all
the tender sensibilities of genius ! Let him only wear dark clothes,
a rueful countenance, an eye-glass, a tuft, and his hair unconscionably
long—let him speak seldom, and when he does, with the most guarded
caution, that he utter nothing but extravagant nonsense—let him be
subject to fits of abstraction, and never answer a question till he is
aroused from his absorbing reflections by its third repetition—let him
always express an indignant contempt for his species, and an utter
aversion to company—nevertheless, let him on no account miss an op-
º
portunity of being dragged into society, that his love of solitude may
not be hidden under a bushel: let him implicitly follow all these in-
structions, and however unpromising his suit, we can assure the
romantic lover thus manufactured—whether a boatswain, a city
alderman, a puisne judge, or a broad comedian—that he shall not
sigh gratis.
Take an example. Letitia Leonora Lurliety, though suspected of
having seen thirty-five summers, still wears long ringlets—and they
match her own hair to a miracle. She quotes Byron in common con-
versation, and knows all the amorous poets by heart. For half the
year she buries her sorrows in a secluded cottage in Derbyshire, and
shares them with all those neighbours who keep footmen and
give parties. But during “the season” she weeps in London,
and spends a competency in laced cambric handkerchiefs, that
her tears may be dried with becoming effect. She is always
the victim of some soul-subduing grief—some inconsolable bereave-
ment; a pet parrot, who was so tractable, so affectionate, has been
maliciously poisoned—her lap-dog, true to his King Charles's breed,
has been inconstant, straying from her caresses by the enticements
of a dog-stealer. Yes, she is born to sorrow—to disappointment—
she never had a friend, one she believed to be a true, sincere, a
faithful friend, but who proved false—she never had a canary that
did not fly away; she “never knew a young gazelle, &c.; "in short,
bereft of all that makes existence tolerable, she has nothing left but
to mourn, to sicken and—to die.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Merrily were Payne's first set progressing to the jolly tunes of the
Polichinelle quadrilles, whilst Leonora poured these sentiments into
the ears of Captain Compton Kitefly, of the Royal Poyaisian Rangers.
It is astonishing how readily he responded to her feelings. The
chord of sympathy was struck. He too had lived a life of blasted
hopes, of terrific disappointments, of bitter woes and how delightful
was it to encounter one (and, upon his honour, she was the only one
he had ever met with) who could appreciate his sentiments—one so
singularly refined, so overpoweringly congenial—inspired with feel-
ings so far above the comprehension of the world's vulgar crowd.
He pressed her hand: she heaved a sigh, and agreed that it was very
delightful.
They parted. Kitefly had previously taken pains to ascertain
every particular concerning the lady, even to the probable amount of
her income. Acting upon his knowledge of her character, he put
the following advertisement into the Times newspaper.
“To L. L. L. The gentleman who had the good fortune to meet
the lady (whose initials are as above) at a ball in Eaton-square last
evening, is earnestly solicitous of another interview. Family reasons
demand the closest secrecy. A reply kindly vouchsafed and confi-
dentially addressed to Capt. C. K., at the Post-office in Queen Anne
Street, will be deemed an inestimable favour.”
Having secured a paper and marked the advertisement, the Captain
sent it to Miss Lurliety, in an envelope marked “most private.” The
necessity for secrecy existing in the fact of the lady being entirely
her own mistress, with no one to control her inclinations, and living
at a boarding-house, where it is not usual for one inmate to open
another's letters. To ordinary, common-place people a note sent per
post would have answered as well, but not to Letitia. She read the
announcement with rapture, and answered it immediately.
Near the southern entrance to Kensington Gardens there is a
retired and thickly-wooded grove. There, at the latest hour pre-
scribed for the entrance of visitors, did Kitefly and Letitia appoint to
meet. The pathetics in one of the arbours, when they did encounter,
were intense and overwhelming. The Captain declared his passion
by the light of the moon. He was in despair; for, even if accepted,
a cruel, relentless parent had for years endeavoured to force his
inclinations towards a cousin whom he detested, with fourteen
thousand a year ! But now he had found one whose mind ran, as it
were, in the same gushing confluence of congenial sentiment—one,
the pulses of whose soul beat in unison with the throes of his own.
No power on earth should constrain him into a marriage with a
beautiful girl he could not love—should force him into the possession
of a magnificent estate and enormous rent-roll
Here he dropped on his knee—slapped his forehead with audible
force with one hand, and grasped the lady's with the other. She
sobbed the rest of the interview cannot be recorded ; it consisted
entirely of tears.
Again they met ! It was at a soirée dansante. They were on no
account to speak, for fear of exciting suspicion; but as the Captain
handed Letitia down to supper he pressed her hand lovingly, and left
in it a small note. She, moving her eyes from side to side with great
rapidity, as if in the last stage of dread that any one should observe
her—placed it in her bosom.
It was midnight ! The moon had filled her horns with most vivid
lustre; the stars beamed their brightest radiance upon the left-hand
side of Lower Brook-street—when a post-chaise and pair stopped at
the corner. The door of No. 99 opened, and a figure wrapped in the
ample folds of a travelling cloak emerged stealthily from the house.
That was met by a man who had a moment before alighted from the
carriage. With strong but tender grasp he half forced, half carried
the lady into the chaise, which drove off at a rapid rate up Bond-
street, in the direction of Gretna Green. -
The next morning Captain Kitefly made Letitia his bride at Barnet
Church; for the post-horses were all let, and they could get no
nearer to Gretna. During a honey-moon of two days they mingled
their imaginary sorrows—till they were overtaken by real ones.
Letitia found on nearer acquaintance that she had married a scamp ;
and Kitefly discovered that his wife's fortune was hardly sufficient to
keep him in whips and gloves.
HARTHOLOMEW FAIR.
THE now tragic ceremony of proclaiming Bartholomew fair was
gone through on Saturday last, with more than the usual solemnity.
| The Lord Mayor went on foot attended by one or two members of the
household, and was dressed in plain clothes, consisting of “a suit of
this superior cloth complete for £4. 12s.,” and a choice selection of a
single pair from a stock of three hundred eight-and-sixpenny
oxonians. The Lord Mayor proclaimed the commencement of the
fair; which was indeed a very necessary piece of information, for if
his lordship had not said it was a fair, no one would have suspected
it. His lordship followed the example of the sign painter, who having
|been engaged to make a painting of the king of beasts in a most
ferocious state, happened to draw it particularly mild, and to prevent
mistakes wrote The Raging Lion immediately under it.
The “gaieties,” which were of the most lugubrious character, com-
menced directly, the Lord Mayor withdrew, and an amateur mounte-
bank, who, in the absence of professional talent volunteered his
services, created some amusment by what is called “taking a sight”
at the retreating authorities.
Richardson's show was not upon the ground, but the drama of Susan
Hopley was being performed in a square green box with two round
holes in it, by the celebrated company of pasteboard, aided by the
well-known scenery painted by W. Pitts and assistants at his exten-
sive marble works in Monmouth Street. The audience, however,
seemed to consist of lads who had placed themselves uninvited on
the free list, for we heard the words, “Now, young chap, let’s have
your halfpenny, or else walk on,” continually addressed to the casual
spectators by the manager. Two or three declared they were wait-
ing for the half-price, when the manager insinuated his personal
objection to larks, and uttered some observations upon chaff, which
we did not catch, but which probably were prompted by the prevail-
ing agitation on the subject of the Corn-law.
On Monday the fair was, of course, at its height, and the stalls
were divided between the bullocks and the gingerbread—the former
being decidedly more in demand than the latter. Wombwell's
menagerie was not erected, but in its place we perceived the cage
from the foot of Waterloo Bridge, with the unrivalled collection of
cats, rats, and pigeons, who went through their surprising evolutions
by running over each other's backs, and exhibiting other remarkable
feats of dexterity. The admission to this entertainment was gratui-
tous, but the proprietor let down the curtain very ferociously several
times during the day, and rapped several boys on the head for not
encouraging with a few eoppers the cause of humanity, exemplified in
the care bestowed on the poor dumb animals. The fair concluded
on Tuesday evening, but we found it difficult to ascertain at what
hour, for no one could draw the line where or at what o'clock the
fair terminated its miserable existence.

with it.
I have the honour to style

thus advertised : “A new school, tuppuns a week, and them as learns

academy; but many establishments so called might be improved by a
judicious imitation of it.
Our national deficiency in politeness is appalling. It appears, from
statistics in my possession, that not one individual in ten millions can
make a curtsey or a bow The carriage, too, of the masses is fright-
ful. Nine-tenths of the population do not know what to do with
their hands; and the gait of the operative and agricultural labourer
is excruciating. How pitiably the dustman hobbles—how dreadfully
the coal-heaver stoops |
There is no cure for this shocking state of things but the kit.
Would we mend men's manners, we must regulate their steps. We
must have the dancing-master abroad, or rather at home ; and I am
sure we want him sadly. The following is an extract from an ex-
amination which I was at the pains of making but the other day
into the breeding of the youth who brings bread to my residence of a
morning, and whom, on account of a disagreeable habit which he had
of whistling at the door after calling out “Ba—ker 1" I found it ne-
cessary to lecture.
“Pray, young gentleman, can you dance ".
“Carn’t I just "
“Will you let me see you ?”
“What for "
“To oblige me.”
“I sharn’t, then.”
“The fact is, sir, that you cannot.”
“Carn’t I though —look here, old Uppercrust 1” (With this he
exhibited the antics of that most ungraceful of pas seuls which the
chimney-sweeps execute in the gutters—Jim Crow.)
Examination resumed :-
“Do you call that dancing "
“Don’t you r"
“Chassez, croisez.”
“What d'yer mean by that "
“Balancez.”
“Balance what I can balance a ladder on my chin, if that's what
you want.”
“Down the middle, and up again.”
“Oh, bother I ain’t taken no hantimony wine.”
“Come, come, sir, don’t pretend to be a greater dunce than you
are. The first position ?”
“P'sition —this here's Bungaree's; that's all I know.” And he
threw himself into the attitude of a person going to fight with fists.
I have questioned a great variety of butchers' boys, lads who con-
vey beer from public-houses, and other juveniles of the same rank in
life, and have almost invariably met with as much rudeness and
ignorance as I encountered in the above instance.
Now, sir, I would have dancing academies established all over the
kingdom. There would be some little expense, perhaps, thereby
incurred ; but we now pay only sevenpence in the pound by way of
Income Tax, and who, for an object so desirable, would grudge “two-
pence more ?” First, by way of experiment, a model school might
be instituted at Exeter-Hall. Of this (not that I have any view
towards self-interest) I should be happy to undertake the manage-
ment in person. Instruction should be imparted thus. The students
should occupy the body of the great room; myself being stationed
on the platform used by the reverend gents to address meetings from
on the subject of Maynooth College. As a collaborateur, I should
require the assistance of the musical professor for the time being, to
play the violin, or, as that instrument may not be sufficiently audible,
the organ. I should also want a lady to waltz, go through minuets
and quadrilles with, and enable me otherwise to illustrate one's duty
towards one's partner. I would likewise be provided with a dozen or
so subordinate instructors of both sexes for “sets ;” whose persons,
I think, to render the whole affair the more pleasing and attractive,
I would have tastefully decorated, as if for a ballet. During their
performance I might describe their different steps and evolutions;
thus illustrating our various technical terms. While waltzing, or
executing a pas de deur, I should like an assistant to explain things
for me; but I could dance a pas seul and lecture at the same time, with
perfect ease.

cutting caperts.
Each exhibition which took place on the platform should be
regularly repeated by the learners below. Thus would the public
soon be initiated by wholesale into what the master of a classical
academy, at which I am also a professor, calls “the mysteries of
Terpsichore.”
That gentleman (I mean the master, not Terpsichore) says that
“to have learned the liberal sciences faithfully, softens men's man-
ners, and does not suffer them to be brutal.” He quotes this out of
Syntax—or Homer, I believe, and he alludes to the classics; but
though he is a very clever man, I am told, in that respect, I do not
think that his scholars find that his knowledge has had much of the
effect he describes on himself. But whatever may be the case as to
other learning, refinement is certainly acquired by learning to dance.
Many a young lady, who learns nothing else, is exquisitely graceful
and soft ; and see what nice, delightful, complaisant people the
French are Oh! if we only knew half of what they do, we should
have our scavengers, costermongers, and watermen taking off their
hats to each other in the streets. How different an appearance, too,
would our public promenades present . How much more gay and
lively would Regent's Park, for instance, be on a Sunday ! Wile the
seriously-disposed might still listen to the Teetotaller and New
Jerusalemite, other groups, of a livelier turn, might go, beneath the
shade, through their innocent quadrilles; the otherwise needless
policeman acting as M.C.
Train up a child in the pas he should practise. Direct his feet in
the right way. But how culpably have we neglected these maxims.
At not one of our parochial schools is any provision made for this
most essential object of tuition; and even at establishments for young
gentlemen it is one of the “extras” —as if it were not as necessary
as washing; as though polish were not as indispensable as cleanli-
ness. Nor is there a dancing professorship at any of our Universities.
Can we wonder, then, at the general awkwardness of scholars?
Is it astonishing that three-fourths of our clergy are unable
to walk, and therefore unfit to enter the Church ; Latin and
Greek may be all very well, but they will not enable us to go
into a room. Mathematics may be useful enough, but they will not
teach us how to offer an arm to a lady. Poetry may be beautiful,
sublime, and pathetic; but the finest poetry is the poetry of motion;
else why is it that the superior classes prefer Deshayes to Shakspere
It always astonished me to hear that Dr. Johnson (who wrote the
dictionary) was so rude a man, till I came to read his life, wherein I
found that he knew no more of dancing than an elephant.
By-the-bye, I once met, I think it was at the end of the said
dictionary, with something about a certain Orpheus, one of the
Greeks, or Romans, or ancient heathen deities, who taught bears
and other animals—nay, even sticks—to dance. The fact, I suppose,
was, that this gent was an eminent artiste in my line, who, by his
professional exertions, civilised his brutes of countrymen.

you think, sir, that if the operatives had been duly taught to dance,
they would have been so rude as to go pulling mills down, and
throwing stones about, even if they had been ever so hungry Im-
possible Dancing, I am confident, will tranquillise the disturbances
of the country, by giving the “movement party” a right direction ;
and, by improving the bearing of the common people, will mitigate

THE MARQUIS OF LONDONDERRY QUITE
“ABROAD.”
A week had scarcely elapsed from the first appearance of Punch—
from the hour of his condescension to letter-press—when a man with
something of the exterior of a gentleman presented himself at the
office of the great humanizer, in Wellington-street. We regret to
state all the facts ; but a recent publication compels us to speak out.
The individual, assisted by the plausibility of a five-pound note,
overcame the stern principle of “our boy,” who lent to the man with
the bribe our very best suit of Sunday motley, our hat, our baton—in
fact, our everything that makes up the mere outside of Punch. The
stranger who thus tampered with the fidelity of our puerile servant—
who, by the subtle inducement of bank paper, turned the honesty of
a ten-year old infant inside out—was
“C. W. WANE, MARQUIs of LoNDoNDERRY, G.C.B., &c.”
We had been ignorant of the circumstance, but for the politeness of
one of the custom-house clerks at Calais, who sent us a letter, for the
subjoined translation of which we are indebted to a very celebrated
dramatist :-
“Monsieur, With this you will receive what I believe to be your
hat, doublet, and jerkin. They were seized in the travelling trunk
of an individual who, from the extreme silliness of his words upon
every occasion, convinced us that he was not Punch, but had by some
means possessed himself of the livery of wisdom the more safely to
play the fool in it. Being strongly pushed upon the point, the indi-
vidual confessed himself to be only a peer of England, and after due
interest being made for him by the British consul here, was permitted
to proceed to Paris.
“I have thought it my duty to return you your habiliments, and
to inform you of the ambitious, yet unprincipled intention, on the
part of a ‘K.C.B., &c. to make Punch as contemptible out of England,
as he is justly adored and celebrated in it.
“IReceive the assurance of my consideration.
“FRAN cois GABELI.E.”
---
This letter was kindly intended ; and although we considered it
our duty to discharge “our boy"," we nevertheless felt no indigna-
tion against the Marquis of LoN DoNDERRY. He had before tried his
own character abroad, knew its worth, and very wisely threw himself
upon Punch. He was certainly despoiled of our clothes, but with a
fine tenacity of purpose, he endeavoured to talk and write quite in
our spirit. If Punch be not popular at Constantinople, it is not the
fault of the Marquis of Londonderry, but of destiny. The Marquis
did all he could with his roo-too-tooit before the Sultan.
We, however, haste to the pleasing duty of laying before the enrap-
tured reader extracts from—
“A Steam Voyage to Constantinople, by the Rhine and the Danube; and to
Portugal, Spain, &c. By C. W. Vane, Marquis of Londonderry, G. C. B. &c.
To which is annered the Author's Correspondence with Prince Metternich, Lords
Ponsonby, Palmerston, &c. 2 vols. Colburn, London.”
Our readers are aware that we seldom use the reviewing quill.
Nothing less than a book by Londonderry, or by Punch himself, could
* It is but justice to the Marquis to state that he has, with his customary libe-
rality, received the child into one of his coal-pits, for the sanctity of which from
}. intrusion of Lord Ashley’s bill he made so humane a stand in the House of
ords.
induce us to break a determination laid down by ourselves on our
first appearance in type. However, Londonderry writes: “Orson is
endowed with reason,” and we cannot but duly chronicle the wonder.
The intention of the noble Marquis is to show the peculiar treat-
ment which fell to his lot abroad. In no place, according to his own
shewing, did he thrust his nose, that his nose was not pulled. We
subjoin an extract. Imagine the noble Marquis at the railway of
Brussels and Liege :-
“I, of course, being a nobleman, and brother to the lamented Castle-
reagh, arrired late at the station; it was only due to my dignity to do
so. I called out lustily for six places, at the same time poking my
elbow in the ribs of a tall spectacled merchant, who poked again; such
poking being followed up by a clerical personage, who poked his long
shovel-hat into my face. After a sturdy fight, and with no other
injury than a bleeding nose and a blackened eye, -for I say nothing
of the abuse dealt out on both sides, I succeeded in seating my party
in safety.”
If anything could shed an additional lustre on a Waterloo hero,
(and Londonderry cuts his mutton at Apsley House on the great
national anniversary), it must have been the combat at the Railway
Pass. Londonderry therein showeth himself hot Cocles.
The Marquis puts up at an Hotel de Russie. Mark what follows:–
“One of our party recorded our entertainment in the Lirre des
Voyageurs as detestable, AF Fixing ou R NAMEs the RETo”
The consequence of this may be easily foreseen. No sooner do the
Marquis of London DERRY and party quit the Hotel de Russie, than
an earthquake swallows up the whole establishment. Nothing escapes
the general calamity, save and except a waiter's napkin, and the
identical Lirre des Voyageurs which called down destruction on the
devoted tavern.
The Marquis is now at Lisbon —
“The Duc de Palmella would not meet me, because when he was
in London, on an important state occasion, I jocularly placed my
thumb and finger to my nose; which harmless and sportive gesture,
the Duke, with a feeling that did no honour to his heart or head, entirely
misinterpreted. Thus I was in Lisbon a whole fortnight—I, the
brother of the never-to-be-lamented Castlereagh—and nobody—no,
not even the little boys in the streets—took the slightest notice of me.”
The Marquis is now on his road to Munich, and wishes an audience
of the King of Bavaria.
“I felt cock-sure,” says the Marquis, “that his Majesty would do
the right thing, inasmuch as when he was Crown Prince in 1814 and
1815, he and I were—to speak metaphorically—thick as thieves.
However, put not your trust in princes; always be it understood,
excepting from the rule Russian princes, with Prince Metternich in
particular. Well, can it be believed the King refused to receive
me, unless I appeared in full uniform and high moustache. My uni-
form had been sent on in a trunk to Munich, and I could not wait a
month for a decent growth of moustache: I, therefore, came to the
unalterable determination of writing a tremendous letter in reply;
and was not at all surprised to hear that the King of Bavaria was
confined to his bed for at least three weeks afterwards.”
The Marquis is now at Constantinople: more, he obtains an audience
of the Sultan
“I thought,of course,” says the noble author, “that I should be re-
ceived in an apartment flaming with topazes and carbuncles : judge
my surprise when I was shown into a small wainscoted chamber,
covered with a Kidderminster carpet. The sovereign of this great
empire was—sitting cross-legged! On beholding me, he manifested not
the least surprise! I approached the Sultan, and drawing back my left
leg, and extending my right arm, (the reader will of course remember
my usual deportment in the House of Lords,) gave in French my
birth, parentage, and education. I reminded the Sultan that at a
very early age I showed extreme precocity of intellect, having, when
only ten years old, counted how many white and black beans would
make five; and had, moreover, at the same early period of life, dis-
covered the father of Zebedee's children. I then spoke of the blood
I had lost in the cause of legitimacy—of my famous ‘too bad' letter
to the Earl of Liverpool—and of the other achievements which have
given me an European reputation. I had talked for about half-an-
hour, when, to my surprise, I discovered the Sultan to be in a pro-
found sleep! I was then desired by Reschid Pacha to leave the
room, and to make as little noise as possible.”
The Marquis obtains an audience for Lady Londonderry, whereupon
he thus moralizes 1–
“It will be a curious fact IN AFTER TIMEs (say the year 5000) if her
ladyship's introduction at the Oriental court should be dated as the
forerunner of one ster of cirilization. Already, it is thought, knives
and forks will force themselves into the Harem l’”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
*—
The Marquis has news from England:—
“It was after a short stay at Naples that I received from England
the sad news that the Almighty had thought fit, in his wisdom, and
for purposes alone known to an inscrutable Providence, to allow my
residence at Wynyard Park, in the county of Durham, to be utterly
and entirely destroyed by fire.”
This, it must be allowed, was a heavy visitation; nevertheless, the
Marquis bore it like a Christian and a man, for he proceeds in the
following beautiful tone of consolation:—
“I was, it is true, bent to the earth by this intelligence. It was,
indeed, too bad that my residence at Wynyard Park should be
destroyed by fire; I however had this comfort wherewith to console
myself: if I had been in London, it might have been—the Thames."
Here the Marquis concludes: but there are parts of this truly
national work which, it is not at all unlikely, we may in our next
return to.
MISS TICKLETOBY'S LECTURES ON

reflection.
This is a prince, my dear young creatures, whom I am afraid some
of you, Master Spry, especially, will be inclined to admire vastly, for he
was as quarrelsome and brave a man as ever lived. He was fighting
all his life long-fighting his brothers, fighting his father, fighting
with anybody who would fight, and, I have no doubt, domineering
over anybody who wouldn't. When his poor old father, wearied
out by the quarrels of his sons, the intrigues of the priests, and the
ceaseless cares and anxieties of reigning, died in sadness and sorrow,
he left Prince Richard, surnamed Lion-Heart, his kingdom, and his
curse along with it, he having acted so undutifully towards him, and
embittered the last years of his life.
don-bridge first. (Immense cheering, part of which, however, seemed
to be ironical.)
Such—such is war ! and, for my part, I profess the greatest abhor-
rence of all such dreadful kind of glory; and hope for the days when
cocked hats and bayonets will only be kept as curiosities in museums,
and scarlet cloth will be kept to make cloaks for old women.
But to return to King Richard—though he professes to be very
sorry for his turbulent conduct during his father's reign, his sorrow
did not lead him to mend his ways at all ; as, alas ! is usual with all
quarrelsome people. The very first thing he did was to prepare for
a great fight; and in order to get money for this, he not only taxed
his people very severely, but sold for a trifle the kingdom of Scotland,
which his father had won. I don’t know what the sum was which
might be considered as trifling for the purchase of that country,” and
indeed historians differ about it: but I leave you to imagine how
hardly he must have been pressed for coin, when he could bring such
an article as that to pawn.
What was called the Christian world then was about this time
bent upon taking Jerusalem out of the hands of the Turks, who pos-
sessed it, and banded together in immense numbers for this purpose.
Many of the princes so leagued were as false, wicked, and tyrannous
men as ever lived ; but Richard Coeur-de-Lion had no artifice at all
in his nature, and entered into the undertaking, which he thought a
godly one, with all his heart and soul. To batter out Turks' brains
with his great axe seemed to him the height of Christianity, and no
man certainly performed this questionable duty better than he. He
and the King of France were the leaders of the crusade; but the
latter, being jealous, or prudent, or disgusted with the enterprise,
went speedily back to his kingdom, and left all the glory and all
the fighting to King Richard. There never was, they say, such a
strong and valiant soldier seen. In battle after battle the Turks
gave way before him, and especially at the siege of Ascalon, he and
his army slew no less than forty thousand Saracens, and defeated
consequently Sultan Saladin, their leader.
In the intervals of fighting it seems that a great number of polite-
nesses passed between these two princes; for when Richard was ill,
Saladin sent him a box of pills from his own particular druggist; and
as for Richard, it is said at one time that he wanted to knight the
gallant Saracen, as though for all the world he were an Alderman or
a Royal Academician. And though the Lion-hearted King felt it his
Christian duty to pursue the Turk, and knoek his brains out if he
Richard was exceedingly sorry for the pain he had caused his father,
and, instead of revenging himself upon his father's ministers (who
had treated him as severely as they could during King Henry's
reign, and who now, I dare say, quaked in their shoes lest King
Richard should deal hardly by them), he of the lion-heart kept them
in their places—and good places, let us be sure, they were ; and said
that they had done their duty by his father, and would, no doubt, be
as faithful to him. For, truth to say, Richard had a heart which
harboured no malice; all he wanted was plenty of fighting, which he
conducted in perfect good humour.
Master Spry.—Hurra! that's your sort.
Silence, Master Spry, you silly boy, you. It may be very well for
Mr. Cribb, or the Most Noble the Marquess of Wat—ford, to rejoice
in punching people's heads and breaking their noses, and to shake
hands before and after; but kings have other duties to attend to, as
we now-a-days know very well. Now suppose you were to break a
score of lamps in the street, or to twist off as many knockers, or to

nerous prince, and admired him more than any sovereign in his own

as you have never a sixpence in your pocket, to pay the damage :
Master Spry.—Pa’d pay, of course.
Yes, rather than see you on the treadmill, he would ; and so, my
dears, it's the case with these great kings—they fight, but we have
to pay. The poor subjects suffer: the men, who have no quarrel
with any prince in Christendom—as how should they, never having
seen one -must pay taxes in the first place, and then must go and
fight, and be shot at and die, leaving us poor women, their wives and
daughters, to deplore their loss, and to nurse their wounds when they
come home. Some forty years since (when I was young, my loves,
and reported to be extremely good-looking), King Buonaparte and
the French were on the point of invading this country. Fancy what
a situation we should have been in had they come—the horrid mon-
sters! My mind shudders at the very idea even now. Fancy my
dear father, the ensign of volunteers, brought home wounded–
dying. Fancy a dozen of horrible soldiers billeted in the house.

“Hullo!” says Blondell, or Blundell, “there must be an Englishman
Sultan ; and there the Lion-hearted King had the misfortune to find
that there was not a single chance for him ever to win it. His army, here, and straightway struck up “Rule Britannia”—“When Britain
by the number of glorious victories, was wasted away greatly. The feh-eh-eh-erst at He evn's command,” &c., to which the king an-
other kings, dukes, and potentates, his allies, grumbled sadly; and swered by “God save the King.”
the end was, that he was obliged to march back to the sea again—
and you may fancy Sultan Saladin's looks as he went off.
So he quitted the country in disguise, and in disgust too—(as for
his army, never mind what became of that: if we lose our time pity-
ing the common soldiers, we may cry till we are as old as Methuselah,
and not get on)—Richard, I say, quitted the country in disguise
and disgust, and, in company with a faithful friend or two, made
for home.
But as he was travelling through Austria, he was recognised by
some people in that country, and seized upon by the Duke of
Austria, who hated him, and clapped him without any ceremony into
prison. And, I dare say, while there he heartily regretted that, in-
stead of coming home over land, he hadn't at once taken the steamer
to Malta, and so got home that way.
Fancy, then, my beloved hearers, this great but unhappy monarch
in prison;–
fancy him, in a prison-dress very likely, made to take his turn on the
mill with other offenders, and to live on a pint of gruel and a penny
loaf a day; he who had been accustomed to the best of victuals, and
was, if we may credit the late celebrated Sir Walter Scott, parti-
cularly partial to wine ! There he was—a king—a great warrior—
but lately a leader of hundreds of thousands of men, a captive in an
odious penitentiary Where was his army again one can't help
thinking. Oh, never mind them : they were done for long since, and
out of their pain. So you see it is King Riehard who is the object of
compassion, for he wasn't killed.
I am led to believe that the prison regimen in Austria was not so
severe as it is now-a-days with us, when if a prisoner were heard
singing, or playing the fiddle, he would be prettily tickled by the
gaoler's cane; for it appears that King Richard had the command of
a piano, and was in the habit of playing upon the guitar. It is
probable that the Duke of Austria thought there could be no harm
in his amusing himself in the lonely place in which, unknown to all
the world, King Richard was shut.
As for his subjects, I don't know whether they missed him very
much. But I have remarked that we pretty speedily get accustomed
to the absence of our kings and royal families; and though, for
instance, there is our beloved Duke of Cumberland gone away to be
King of Hanover, yet we manage to bear our separation from that
august prince with tolerable resignation.
Well, it was lucky for the King that he was allowed his piano; for
it chanced that a poor wandering minstrel (or organ-grinder, we
should call him), who had no doubt been in the habit of playing
tunes before the King's palace in St. James's-street—for, you know,
the new police wasn't yet invented, to drive him off—I say the
organ-grinder Blundell happened to be passing by this very castle in
Austria where Richard was, and seeing a big house, thought he
might as well venture a tune; so he began that sweet one “Cherry
ripe, che-erry ripe, ri-ip I cry-y;” and the Austrian soldiers, who
were smoking their pipes, and are very fond of music, exclaimed,
“Potztausend was ist das für ein herrliches Lied ?”
When Richard heard that well-known melody, which in happier
days he had so often heard Madame Vestris sing”, he replied at once
on the piane, with “Home, sweet Home.”
* This settles the great question mooted every week in the Sunday Times as to
tlt age of that lady.
Can it be—is it possible—no—yes—is it really our august monarch?
thought the minstrel—and his fine eyes filled with tears as he ground
the sweet air “Who are you r"
To which the King answered by a fantasia composed of the two
tunes “The King, God bless him,” and “Dicky Gossip, Dicky Gossip
is the man”—for though his name wasn't Gossip, yet you see he had
no other way of explaining himself.
Convinced by these melodies, Mr. Blundell replied rapidly by
“Charlie is my Darling,” “All's Well,”“We only part to meet
again,” and, in short, with every other tune which might, as he
thought, console the royal prisoner. Then (only stopping to make a
rapid collection at the gate) he posted back to London as fast as his
legs would carry him, and told the parliament there that he had dis-
covered the place where our adored monarch was confined.
Immense collections were instantly made throughout the country
—some subscribed of their own accord, others were made to sub-
scribe; and the Emperor of Germany, who was made acquainted with
the fact, now, though the Duke of Austria had never said a word about
it previously, caused the latter prince to give up his prisoner; and I
believe His Imperial Majesty took a good part of the ransom to
himself.
Thus at last, after years of weary captivity, our gracious King
Richard was restored to us. Fancy how glad he must have been to
see Hyde Park once more, and how joyful and happy his people were!
—I dare say he vowed never to quit Buckingham Palace again, and
to remain at home and make his people happy.
But do you suppose men so easily change their natures —Fiddle-
stick!—in about a month King Richard was fighting in France as
hard as ever, and at last was killed before a small castle which he
was besieging. He did not pass six months in England in the whole
course of his four years' reign : he did more harm to the country than
many a worse king could do; and yet he was loved by his people for
his gallantry; and somehow, although I know it is wrong, I can't
help having a sneaking regard for him too.
My loves, it is time that you should go to play.

THE GRAND AQUATIC PROGRESS.
(From our own Reporter.)
The determination of her Majesty to visit her Scotch dominions having
been made generally known, the sun turned out of its bed in the east and
the tide rose at an unusually early hour, for the purpose of facilitating the
views and promoting the objects of royalty. At about two in the
morning the ringing of the bedroom bell announced to the household that
the royal hot water for the princely shave was immediately wanted, and a
jug filled from the kitchen boiler was soon standing at the door of Prince
Albert's dressing-room. The Master of the Household, who had tied a
piece of string to his own great toe, and caused the other end of it to be
fastened to the thumb of the Lord in Waiting, was forcibly dragged from
his bed before daybreak, and was compelled to hop on one leg to the key-
hole, through which the twine had been passed, and was being mercilessly
tugged by Silver Stick, who was determined that the Master of the
Household should not go off into a second sleep, and thus be unprepared
for attendance at the proper hour on his royal mistress.

his own especial request, which he had made overnight to his valet,
under an apprehension of oversleeping himself, was extremely indig-
nant at the treatment he .# at the hands of his servant,
who nevertheless, knowing the importance of getting his master up,
continued to administer the contents of the ewer with undiminished
energy. These difficulties having at length been surmounted, the royal
attendants were got together in the hall, where they were all grum-
bling at those immediately under them, with that degree of ill-temper
which might be expected among a parcel of sleepy, folks, who
had been turned out of bed by means of what the boys call “cold pig,”
and other ingenious devices which one is ready to propose overnight, but
which, when the morning arrives, are found excessively disagreeable.
The royal cortége had scarcely left the court-yard of the Castle, when
the discovery was made, that though the Lords in Waiting had started,
some of the spoons were still left behind; and as these were intended for
the Queen's use on board, every one was lost in wonder what on earth the
court would do in the passage.
One of the numerous sticks—either gold, silver, or lead—that are always
at hand in a palace, was at once despatched with the plate, for the use of
the sovereign and her suite; but, determined to lose no time, the official
started by the railroad direct for the North, leaving Her Majesty and
Consort to help themselves to salt with the tip of their knives, eat fish
with steel forks, and experience other necessitudes to which passengers
in a ship, like the frequenters of small eating-houses, are occasionally
liable.
Having paid for a ticket on board the Daffy-down-dilly—our craft,
which was nothing to be compared to the craft of the captain, who took us
in more extensively than the vessel itself—was pronounced to be unsea-
worthy; but the words “no money returned,” and the announcement that
the Daffy-down-dilly only sailed “Weather permitting,” (though we had
understood she was to start on this occasion Whether or No), precluded
us from doing more than pronouncing the captain a regular Do; an epithet
which only caused the unprincipled tar to turn his tongue significantly
We at length succeeded in obtaining a comfortable berth on board a
steamer which overtook the royal squadron, and we had an opportunity
of watching all the proceedings on board the Queen's yacht, of which we
furnish the following interesting particulars:—The fleet was now at the
Nore, and the wind was Nor by Nor-West, when the Sovereign gave a
lurch, and one of the sticks in waiting, but whether gold or silver we could
not at the distance perceive, was turned smack over on his beam-ends, at
which the Queen and Prince Albert were observed to laugh heartily. The
swell caused by the Monkey steamer, and indeed there is always something
rather swellish about the Monkey, caused one of the ladies to rush to the
side of the vessel, and we soon afterwards observed, by the light of a Roman
candle, that the crew were taking their grog in mid-ships, a process which
was being intently watched by Prince Albert and her Majesty.
Here we lost sight of the royal squadron, and having given three
cheers for the Prince of Wales, we fired off a Waterloo cracker and sheered
off towards Blackwall, where we touched with considerable violence.

PUNCH*S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
Let TER VIII.-CONCLUSION OF Tiie “her METICAL” PHILOSO phy.
I HAV E learned another trick in this solitude. I have learned to
separate the twin natures with which, it is my belief, every man is
born, and to sit in judgment upon the vices, the follies, the high
feelings, and grovelling appetites, that make up the double me. Make
a trial of the process, reader. Quit the world for a season, Look
boldly into yourself; and however high may have been your notion
of the cleanliness of your moral temple, you will, if you look with
steady, courageous eyes, blush and marvel at its many dirty little
holes and corners, the vile, unswept nooks—the crafty spiders and
their noisome webs. And in this temple, to your surprise, you will
behold two pulpits for two preachers. In the innocency of your
knowledge you thought there was but one divine, and that a
most respectable, orthodox, philanthropic creature; punctual in his
discourses, exemplary in his discipline—indeed, the very pattern of a
devout and cheerful man. You look, and behold, there is another
preacher, a fellow with no more reverence in him than in a Malay
amuck; a pettifogging, mean-spirited, albeit quick-witted, shuffling
scoundrel, whose voice, too, in the throng and press of the world has
appeared to you so like the voice of the good grave gentleman
whom you deemed alone in his vocation, that you have a thousand
times, without reflection, followed his bidding—unhesitatingly obeyed
his behests, and only now, when you have set apart a season for con-
sideration, only now perceive the imposture-recognize the coun-
terfeit.
“What "you exclaim, “and was it he who prompted me with
that bitter answer to poor inoffensive Palemon?” “Was it he
who bade me button up my pocket and growl—“No,' to such a
petitioner on such a day !” “Was it he who whispered me to
cross the road, and cut to the heart the ruined, shabby-coated
Damon f" . And still further considering the matter, you remember
that the interloper monitor, the fellow whose very existence
you never suspected, has had nearly all the talk to himself;
the grave gentleman, whose voice has been so well imitated,
and whom you thought your pastor and your master, having
been silenced, out-talked, by the chattering of an unsuspected opponent.
I say it, you are twin-souled. Step into my hermitage. Submit to
wholesome discipline of thought, and, be assured of it, you will, in
due season, be able to divorce self from self; to arraign your fallen
moiety at the bar of conscience; to bring against it a thousandscore of
crimes, a thousand peccadilloes, all the doings of the scurvy rascal
you bear within you, and whose misdeeds are for the first time
made known to you.
Well, the court is open.
Who, -you cry, is that beetle-browed, shuffling, cock-eyed knave
at the bar i Ishe a poacher, a smuggler, a suborner of false-testi-
mony, a swindler, a thief?
Gently, gently, sir; that unfortunate creature is your twin-soul.
It was he who in the case of Mr. Suchathing advised you to—
God bless me ! I remember—don't speak of it—shocking !—
I’m very sorry.
And it was he who, when poor widow Soandso—
There, hold your tongue ! I recollect all about it. IIow have
I been deceived by that scoundrel ! But then, how could I ever
have believed that I carried such a rascal about me !
For my own part, I am firm in the faith that I should never
have discovered my own twin varlet had I not shut the door upon
the world and taken a good inside stare at myself. No ; my hair
would have grown grey and my nose wine-coloured—for it hath a
purpureal weakness, and as a distinguished statesman, whose name
I forget, once said, I might have patted the back of my naughty
twin soul, deeming him a remarkably fine sample of the article;
and so gone on, working for a handsome epitaph, and dying with a
Uhristian-like assurance that I had earned the same. I might have
lived and died thus self-deluded, but for this retreat so happily
opened to me by the illustrious nobleman aforesaid.
“A work of this nature is not to be performed upon one leg; and should
smell of oil, if duly and desertedly handled.”
Such is the solemn avowal of a fantastically grave philosopher, on
the completion of his opus magnum; but surely that vaunt hath a
more fitting abiding-place in the present page. My subject, too,
like that of my brother philosopher, from its innate dignity, its
comprehensive usefulness, might employ the goose-quills of a whole
college. It were easy to tell off at least five hundred men—many of
them having the ears of kings, and, what are sometimes longer, the
purse-strings of nations at their command—all of them, by nature
and practice, admirably fitted for the work. From their very suc-
cesses the world has a claim upon them for the encyclopaedic labour.
However, until the time arrives when these men, touched by a sense
of their ingratitude, shall repair the wrong, let the present little
book receive the welcome due to good intentions. I am content, in
the whirl and mutation of all mundane things, to be trumped by a
minister, a cardinal, a philosopher, a commercial philanthropist, by
any one or one hundred of these :—when such men shall have grown
sufficiently ingenuous to respond to the crying wants of their fellow-
creatures, and shall publish Humbug in ertenso, I shall sleep quietly
beneath the marble monument which the gratitude of my country
will erect to my memory, although this little volume, superseded by
the larger work, shall be called in like an old coinage, and no longer
be made the class-book of the young, the staff of the middle-aged,
and the solacing chronicle of the old.
Imperfect as the work may be, it would, I feel, have been im-
possible to write at all upon Humbug amid the delicious distractions
of London. Is it asked, - wherefore? Alas ! the writer would have
been confounded by the quantity of his materials. Solitude—con-
tinued, profound solitude—was necessary to the gestation and safe
delivery of this book. I have endeavoured to show that the true so-
lemnities, the real sweetnesses of death—the mystery of our inner
|selves, which said mystery we walk about the world with, deeming
it of no more complexity than the first mouse-trap, are only to be
approached and looked upon in their utter nakedness when safe
from the elbows and the tongues of the world. Now, if life be a
mystery, Humbug is at once the art and heart of life. A man may,
indeed, get a smattering of moral philosophy in a garret within
ear-shot of the hourly courtesies of hackney-coachmen; but Hunt-
bug, though shu often ride in a coach of her own through the
highways of the city, like a fine lady, suffers her pulse to be felt only
in private. Humbug is the philosopher's Egeria, and to be wooed
and known in secret.
Think you, reader, there is no other reason for the sundry pro-
rogations of Parliament, than that the excellent men, (selected only
for their wisdom and their virtue from their less wise and less
virtuous fellows,) having generously presented so many pounds to
the state, their services are for a time no longer required Such
is not the profound intent of prorogation. Its benevolent purpose
is to send every senator into healthful solitude, that he may fortify
himself with a frequent contemplation of his past votes; that he
may call up and question his twin soul, and rejoice himself to know
that the Dromios within him have given their voices in accordance
—that one of the sneaking gemini, out of the baseness of expected
gºns, has not cried “Ay,” when its nobler fellow stoutly intended

RURAL INTELLIGENCE.

Bishopsburg, Sept. 9, 1842.
Iſºme we are “procul negotiis,” which the country gentlemen trans-
late into “having no business here.” Bless their innocence 1
But, as touching news. We are as brisk in these parts as bees—at
Christmas. There is as much bustle in the High-Street as there is in the
nave of the Cathedral. The state of the neighbourhood is tranquil. A
rumour that the minor canons were going to strike, prevailed a little while
ago, but it turns out to be a hoax. The town-clock to be sure, has struck;

that is, it has not struck, these ten days—the hands, however, it is hoped,
will soon return to their work. It is true, also, that a turn-out took place,
last week, at Mrs. Golightly's, the milliner's, one of whose young women
had entrapped the affections of Mr. G. The occurrence has created a
grand schism among the townspeople; one half of them taking the mis-
tress's part—the other that of the girl. The Dean has changed his
muffin-man, and alterations are anticipated in the government of the
workhouse; but the mind of the magistrates is not known. The beadle
gets stout.
The apothecary of the County Hospital was called before the Com-
mittee last Wednesday, and reprimanded for wearing a white hat.
One of those exhibitions, denominated by the newspapers “disgusting,”
took place here on Saturday. Young Lord D'Arcy De Lane (or, as some
spell it, De l'Ane), who is staying at Swineham Park with Sir Harry
Brewster, bet the Honourable Jarvey Jenkyns, of Slangfield Lodge, 50l.,
that a Mr. William Noakes, a clodhopper residing in the vicinity, would
eat a boiled leg of mutton at one meal. Mr. Noakes enjoys a great repu.
tation for voracity; from a signal display whereof, on a certain occasion,
in the matter of a particular viand, he is honoured with the sobriquet of
“chitterlings,” or, as the natives pronounce it, “Chiddluns.”
The affair came off at the “Hampshire Hog’’ in the High Street. The
day being that of the corn-market, a large body of the yeomanry were
attracted to witness it. Several of the neighbouring gentry also attended;
among whom we noticed the Marquis of Melton, Sir Peter Badgerley, Sir
Philip Varmynt, Marmeduke Swigley, and Swype Englefield, Esqrs.
Among the visitors were likewise several members of the corporation.
The clergy, with one or two exceptions, kept aloof; and not one of the
fair sex graced the scene with her presence. The cloth was laid in the
ball-room of the hotel.
At half-past two o'clock precisely, the leg of mutton was introduced,
and placed, amid much applause, on the table. The lion of the day then
entered, and was received with loud cheering, which he acknowledged by
pulling down his head by some of the bristles in front of it. On being
questioned how he was, he replied, “Chuffish.”
In height he appeared, with an allowance for his slouch, about five feet
eleven. He rejoiced in a head exceedingly like a pumpkin, slightly coarse
features, and an expression between that of a cod-fish and a boa-constric-
tor. He seemed, however, to have an obscure consciousness that he was
somebody, and about to attempt something rather fine. His cheek was pale
—but not with thought ; his figure, in spite of his propensities, somewhat
lanky: the sentimental eye might perhaps have regarded him as consump-
tive, as, in strict language, he certainly was. His hands and feet were
gigantic, and not shapely.
Mr. Noakes had dressed for dinner. He wore a velveteen shooting
jacket, an ample yellow waistcoat, flowered with pink and green, an orange
and red cotton neckcloth, tied in a hard knot, short corduroy trousers, and
ankle-jacks. In the button-hole of his outer garment he had stuck a bunch
of tansy.
He strode heavily to the table, seated himself without a word, and fixed
a look of determination on the devoted joint. A slight convulsive move-
ment was observable about his throat; and his eyes dilated in a manner
curious to behold.
“Now for it ‘Chiddluns,’” said the landlord, as the plate was set before
the performer. Mr. Noakes replied not ; but helped himself to a small
abovelful of turnip, and some potatoes. He then smacked his lips, squared
his arms, and set to. His first morsel quite electrified the spectators, and
produced a general exclamation of “My eye "
His mastication was deliberate and leisurely; and its strong resem-
blance to the rumination of an ox was obvious to everybody. “A looks
as if 'a was a chewin' the cud, doan't a " observed a grazier to
Mr. Swigley.
“Three to one on Chiddluns,” was offered by the Marquis of Melton,
and accepted by Sir Peter Badgerley.
Having finished the first “round,” which he did in a few minutes, for
the pieces which he took at a time were very large, Mr. Noakes drank an
immense quantity of ale, burying his face, for the purpose, in the tankard
in a manner which was highly admired ; his noble backer inquiring
whether he found his mutton sufficiently tender, he answered, “Eht"
and the meaning of the question having been explained to him, he
said, “Ees.”
“I zay, neighbour,” inquired one of the farmers of another, “do'st
think thee could'st play as good a stick as that there chap 2" “Naw,”
was the reply, “but I thinks our Jim could.”
A respectable linen-draper of the town, addressing Mr. Noakes as Sir,
begged to be allowed to assist him to caper sauce. hereunto that gen-
tleman politely replied “Git out !”
Mr. Noakes had not achieved more than half of his labours, when, to
the great alarm of all who had staked money on him, he suddenly came to
a stand-still, and leant back in his chair. The Honourable Jarvy Jenkyns
expressed an idea that he was “knocked up.” “Oh don't flatter your-
self,” said Lord D’Arcy de Lane, “Chiddleham has not dined yet.”
Mr. Noakes certainly had not. He opened his eyes and mouth a little,
gazed a moment upon vacancy, and exclaimed, “Lor’?”
“What's the matter, Noakes #" inquired the landlord.
“Darn' if I didn't think,” declared Chiddluns, “as how I'd vorgot
zummat'''
“Forgot what "
“Why, the zalt.”
The want in question having been supplied, Mr. Noakes resumed pro-
ceedings, and the mutton soon began to look, like himself, very foolish.
As the bone became more and more denuded, the circle of observers drew
closer and closer round the artist, who, apparently finding it rather
oppressive, laid down his knife and fork, and emitted a loud “whiff.”
The landlord desired a waiter to put up the window.
The persevering swain returned to the charge, and soon his interesting
task approached completion within half a pound. He now, however,
showed signs of exertion; his brow became slightly bedeved, and he was
obliged to have recourse to the tails of his neck-cloth. The betting became
even.—“Let's gie thee a drap of greavy,” said a by-stander.
Mr. Noakes took the jug containing the remainder of about a gallon of
strong beer. It was a moment of intense anxiety. He raised, with slow
determination, the liquor to his lips, and drank it every drop. He next
took a long, steady breath, which he as slowly exhaled, and then stuffing
the residual mass into his oral aperture, consigned it, with one gulp, to
his digestive cavity.
“Hip ! hip ! hip ! hoo-ray !” shouted the company, and “Chiddluns
| has done it !” was in a few moments the cry of the town. His lordship
appeared quite delighted with his success, and, having presented Mr.
Noakes with the sum of one guinea, and ordered a barrel of beer to
be broached in the stable-yard for the public benefit, got into a remark:
ably neat dog-cart, and drove off to Swineham amid cheers that had
never been equalled in the memory of
The oldest in HABITANT.
Now, how much better would it be if the aristocracy, instead of spending
their money in vain and frivolous amusements, were to divert themselves,
like Lord D'Arcy De Lane, by feeding the people ! How effectually would
they promote that fine and estimable feature of the manly English cha-
racter, a large appetite But I have not room to moralise. Adieu !
P.S. Chiddluns, on being asked, shortly after dinner, whether he would
take anything more ? is reported to have replied, “Naw, thankee, not
just yit, but I thinks I could manage a rasher by’m by.”
It is in contemplation to write over the door of Dover gao!, “Hair cut on the

THE ROYAL VISIT TO SCOTLAND.
HFR Majesty's arrival on Scottish ground gave occasion to a contre-
temps of a very distressing character. The Lord Provost, who it seems,
with the six members of the Council, most unexpectedly enacted the parts
of the Seven Sleepers, and when the Queen set her foot upon Scottish
ground, the Provost was snug in bed, as were all the rest of the civic
authorities.
It had been arranged that a set of signals were to be given which
would have roused the Provost in time to allow his Lordship to get up
and shave before he received the Queen, but the two men stationed on the
Observatory got quarrelling as to whether the Royal squadron was the
Royal squadron or not ; so that between one and the other no signal was
given.
It is said that the whole population were on the itch to see the Queen,
and when it was thought that the Lord Provost prevented them from
coming to the scratch, i. rage knew no limits.
Victoria, however, with that condescension which is so peculiar to her-
self, consented to repeat her entry into Edinburgh rather than disappoint
the sleepy Provost, and the slumbering population; who, though they enjoy
generally the reputation of sleeping wide awake, were on this occasion most
atrociously somnolent. The ceremony of the public entry was at length
performed, of which our own reporter has furnished us with the following
conclusive particulars:—
When the royal carriage reached the Canongate, a most interesting sight
presented itself, for the Asylum for the Houseless had prepared a splendid
show of destitute children, who in their native dirt, as the sons of the soil,
were set out to the number of one hundred on a raised platform. We
have heard of Dahlia and other flower shows, but a ragged urchin
show, was such “a dainty dish to set before the Queen’’ as none but
a Scotch metropolis could have possibly hit upon. Her Majesty,
upon being informed that the dirty faces were all genuine, and that
the children appeared in the identical tatters in which they had been
picked-up over night in the streets, was pleased to declare herself highly
entertained with a sight so thoroughly national.
A little farther on, set out upon a raised platform, were twenty-five
orphans dressed in white, which her Majesty was pleased to compare to a
show of so many dolls laid out on the stall of a toyseller. These children
added much to their interesting character by pelting her Majesty with
flºwers, from baskets with which they had been supplied; and though the
Queen, like Horace Walpole, “laughed at the joke,” it is possible that she
may not have forgiven the rudeness.
The cortège passed on amid the most enthusiastic brandishing of ban-
dannas, and the most gratifying grouping of gossamers. On approaching
the barrier, for there is no gate, her Majesty was presented by the Lord
Provost with those disgraceful sinecurists, the keys of the city. We could
not catch what the Provost said, but what he meant was nearly as
follows:—
“MAY IT PLEASE YoUR MAJESTY,-
“Here are the keys of the city, but the gates to which they belong have
long since disappeared, and as to the lock they were made to fit, that has
bolted. In offering you the keys we must beg of your Majesty to believe
that we are actuated not by a love of a lark, but the loftiest loyalty.”
To which her Majesty laughingly replied as follows:–
“My LoRL PRovost, - .
“I return these keys with confidence into the hands of the authorities
of Edinburgh, for what these keys secure I am sure you are exactly com-
petent to protect and watch over.”
The only drawback to the pleasure of the day was occasioned by a set
of noisy vagabonds who persevered in following up the Queen, and boring
her Majesty by playing the bagpipes. The Queen had at first begged the
nuisance might be discontinued, but on being told it was the national
music, she goodnaturedly put up with it.
WARM WORK.
A correspondent of the Times, who is very angry with the bakers for
keeping up the price of bread, adopts the signature of One who has been in
the Oven.
* Leading the oppost rion.
This naturaliy accounts for the extreme crustiness which he exhibits.
We presume there is something to be very proud of in having “been
in the oven ;” and we should not be surprised—as the ovenite has
clearly a literary turn—if he were to advertise, “Notes taken during his
abode in the very warm climate he professes to have visited.” There
might be an amusing chapter on the geology of bread, and its crustaceous
qualities, with other matter, which, as we have never “ been in the oven,”
we cannot exactly anticipate.
MISS TICKLETOBY'S LECTURES ON
ENGLISH HISTORY.
As it is by no means my wish to say anything disrespectful of any
sovereign who ever ascended the British throne, we must, my loves,
pass over the reign of His late Majesty King John as briefly as pos.
sible; for, between ourselves, a greater rascal never lived. You
have many of you read of his infamous conduct to Rowena, Cedric
the Saxon, and others, in the History of Sir Wilfrid of Ivanhoe;
and I fear there are other facts, though perhaps not on so good
authority, which are still more disreputable.
In the plays of the ingenious Shakspeare, some of which I have
seen at Covent Garden, His Majesty's nephew, Prince Arthur, is
made to climb over a canvas wall of about three feet high, and die
lamentably of the fall in a ditch, in which a mattress has been laid;
but the truth, I fear, is, that Prince Arthur did not commit suicide
voluntary or involuntary, but that his Royal Uncle killed him, for
His Royal Highness was the son of His Majesty's elder brother, and,
by consequence, our rightful king. Well, well, there are ugly stories
about high personages at Court, and you know it makes very little
difference to either of the princes, now, which reigned and which
didn't ; and I dare say, if the truth were known, King John by this
time is heartily sorry for his conduct to his august nephew.
It may be expected that I should speak in this place of a cele-
rated document signed in this reign, by some called the commence-
ment of eur liberties, by others Magna Charta. You may read this
very paper or parchment at the British Museum any day you please,
and if you find anything in it about our liberties, I am a Dutchman
—that is, a Dutchwoman (hear, hear); whereas, as the Register of
Saint Bartholomew's, Smithfield, of the year seventeen hundred and
—ahem —as the Register, I say, proves, I am a Briton, and glory in
the title.
The Pope of Rome, who lived in those days, was almost as facetious
a person as Pope Gregory, of whom before we have spoken ; and
what do you think he did I'm blessed if he did not make a present
of the kingdom of England to the King of France 1 (immense
laughter:) then afterwards he made a present of it to King John
very kindly; and the two kings were about, as usual, to fight for it,
when the French king's army was in part shipwrecked, and partly
beaten; and King John himself was seized with an illness, which
put an end to him. And so farewell to him. He rebelled against
his father, he conspired against his brother, he murdered his nephew,
and he tyrannised over his people. Let us shed a tear for his me-
mory, and pass on to his son, King Henry III., who began to reign in
the year 1216, and was king for no less than fifty-six years.
I think the best thing he did during that long period was, to beget
his gallant son, who reigned after him, under the title of King
Edward the First. The English lords, in King Henry's time, were
discontented with his manner of reigning—for he was always in the
hands of one favourite or another; and the consequence was, that
there were perpetual quarrels between the lords and the prince,
who was continually turned out of his kingdom and brought back
again, or locked up in prison and let loose again. . In the intervals
the barons ruled, setting up what is called an oligarchy: when Henry
governed himself, he was such a soft, effeminate creature, that I
think they might have called his reign a mollygarchy.
As not the least applause or laughter followed this pun, Miss T.,
somewhat disconcerted, said, I see you do not wish to hear anything
more regarding Henry III, so, if you please, we will pass on to the
history of his son, a wise king, a stern and great warrior. It was he
who first gave the Commons of England in Parliament any authority
or power to cope with the great barons, who had hitherto carried all
before them ; which, with the most sincere respect for their lord-
ships, I cannot but think was a change for the better in our glorious
constitution. -
He was in the Holy Land when his father's death was announced
to him, following the fashion of that day, to fight against the Turks,
and murder them for the honour of religion. And here I cannot
help pointing out, how necessary it is that men should never part
from their wives; for the king, by having his with him, escaped a
great danger. A man of a certain tribe called the Assassins (who
have given their names to murderers ever since) stabbed the king in
his tent with a dagger, whereupon the queen, and honour be to her,
supposing that the knife which inflicted the wound might have been
poisoned, sucked the wound with her own Royal lips, and caused
Prince Edward to say, that a good wife was the very best doctor in

the world. Look how the great artist I employ has represented the
scene
This good queen died abroad, and her husband caused crosses to
be erected at the different places where her body rested on its way
to its burial, where the people might stop and pray for her soul. I
wonder how many people who pass by Charing-cross now-a-days
ever think of her, or whether the omnibuses stop there in order that
the cads and coachmen may tell their beads for good Queen Elinor
From 1272, when he began to reign, until 1307, when he died, King
Edward was engaged in ceaseless wars. In being lord of the largest
portion of the island of Great Britain, he had a mind to possess the
whole of it ; and, in order to do so, had to subdue the Welsh first,
and the Scots afterwards. Perhaps some of you have read an ode
by Mr. Gray, beginning “Ruin seize thee, ruthless king?” But as not
a single person in the company had, Miss T. said, “At any rate, my
loves, you have heard, no doubt, of the bards : *
Miss Binge.—Papa calls Shakspeare the immoral bard of Heaven.
What is a bard, ma'am!
Miss T-Why, the bards, as I am led to believe, are Welsh poets,
with long beards, who played Welsh airs upon Welsh harps. Some
people are very fond of these airs; though, for my part, I confess,
after hearing “Poor Mary Ann” played for fourteen consecutive
hours by a blind harper at Llangollen, I rather felt as if I should
prefer any other tune to that.
Master Spry.—Pray, ma'am, hare the Welsh airs hanything like
the Welsh rabbits If so, mother can perform 'em very prettily.
(A laugh, which Miss Tickletoby severely checks, and continues)—This
country of Wales King Edward determined should be his own, and
accordingly made war upon the princes of the Principality, who
withstood him in many bloody actions, and at one time were actually
puffed up with the idea that one of their princes should become King
of England, on account of an old prophecy of Merlin's—
* Llwllwyn pdwdlardl cumlwm.”—MERLIN's Profurcies.
“I.et Wales attend the bard prophetic said:
1.V at Y. shall crown Llewellyn's Z.”—Simcos.
From which obscure phrase the people, and Lllewellyn himself, were
led to believe that they would overcome the stern and powerful King
of England.
But the prophecy was fulfilled in a singular way. On the two
armies meeting together on the river Wye, Llewellyn was slain by
an English knight, and his head in derision crowned with ivy. The
other Welsh Sovereign, Prince David, met with a worse fate than to
die in battle; he repeatedly rebelled against King Edward, and was
forgiven until the last time, when he was taken in arms, and judged
to die as a rebel, so forming the last of his line.
If the King had had trouble with the Welsh, with the Scots he
had still more, and was occupied during almost the whole of his
reign in settling (after his own fashion, to be sure) that unruly nation.
In one of his invasions of Scotland, he carried off the famous stone
on which the Scottish kings used to sit at their coronation—and a
very cold seat it must have been for their Majesties, considering their
unhappy custom of wearing no small-clothes; which are not the least
of the inestimable, I may say inexpressible, benefits the Scots have
derived from commerce with this country.
| On the regular line of the Scotch kings having ended—(never
mind in whose person, for, after all, a king without pantaloons is a
sorry subject to trouble one's head about)—the regular line being
| ended, there started up several claimants to the throne; and the
lords of the country, in an evil hour, called upon Edward to decide
who should succeed. He gave a just award, assigning the crown to
one John Baliol ; but he caused Baliol to swear fealty to him for his
crown, and did not scruple about having him up to London whenever
he was minded. It is said that he summoned him to court six times
in one year, when Edinburgh was at least a month's journey from
London. So thus the poor fellow must have passed the whole year
upon the road, bumping up and down on a rough-trotting horse; and
he without what-d'ye-call-'ems, too !—after the fashion of Humphrey
Clinker.
The consequence may be imagined. Baliol was quite worn out by
such perpetual jolting. Flesh and blood couldn’t bear twelve of these
journeys in a year; and he wrote to King Edward, stating his deter-
mination no longer to be saddled with a throne.
Wisely, then, he retired. He took up his residence in Normandy,
where he passed his life quietly in devotion, it is said, and the culti-
vation of literature. The Master of Baliol College, Oxford, has
kindly communicated to me a MS., in the hand-writing of the retired
prince, accompanied with designs, which, though rude, are interesting
to the antiquary. Here is one representing John of Baliol on the
North-road, which must have been in a sad condition indeed at the
close of the thirteenth century.
The motto placed beneath the illumination by the Royal bard is a
quaint, simple, and pathetic one. He says touchingly—
“To Scotys withouten brychys rydinge is not swete.
I mote have kept my crowne, I shold have lost my seate.”
IIe retired, then ; but a greater than he arose to battle fol the in
dependence of his country.

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON IDLER.
chapter xii.--THE St REET Boy.
ONSCIOUS that we should
be guilty of an act of great
injustice in omitting to make
mention of the subject of our
present chapter amongst the
other London Idlers, he being
the greatest of them all, we
hasten to give him a place
in our gallery of pen-and-ink
drawings.
The Street-Boy is as pecu-
liar to the metropolis, as his
prototype the gaministo Paris.
He has a shrewdness of ob-
servation, a precocious cun-
ning, and, above all, an art of
annoying, which we look for
in vain amidst the youth of the
- rural districts. We confess,
that for all our usually placid disposition, when walking in the streets
we cannot stand the sarcasms of the little boys. They are like mosqui-
toes, who sting and buz about you, but are never to be caught ; and
whether they make an allusion to your white trousers, your long hair,
or your peculiar hat, with observations similar to “Voudn't I have a
pair o' ducks,” “I never see sech a mop,” or, “Oh, my vot a lummy
tile,” the shaft is sure to rankle a wound much deeper than you give
it credit for. He is most acutely annoying to the Foreign gentleman,

when he catches him off the pavement of Regent-street (for the
Street-Boy does not often venture thereon), and delights his com-
panions by marching after him with a droll imitative gait, or drawing
attention to the flower-pot on his head.
The Street-Boy forms the most important part of the audience to
all the out-of-doors exhibitions. His laugh is the loudest, his ap-
plause the most vigorous, and his remarks the most forcible; but at
the same time his voluntary contribution is the worst. This princi-
pally arises from his never having any money—a circumstance which
drives him to seek gratuitous amusements, in which he, nevertheless,
finds far more pleasure than in those paid for by the superior
orders. Where the monied idler pays a shilling to descend
in the car of the Centrifugal Railway, he procures the same
excitement for nothing, by sliding down the hand-rail of the
steps at the Duke of York's column. On grand occasions, when
the wealthy hire a coach to go round and see the illumina-
tion, or other spectacle, he rides on the spikes behind, gratis; and
indeed, as connected with every species of parasitical carriage exer.
cise, he appears to be case-hardened against any mechanical inven-
tion to render the position disagreeable. He sees the balloon, when
it is up, just as well from Kennington-lane as from the interior of the
gardens; and the same remark applies to a cheap view of the Giran-
dola of St. Angelo over the palings.
If there is one amusement upon which the Street Boy does not
hesitate to expend the few pence he has picked up by holding
horses, going on errands, or carrying carpet-bags from the railway
and steam-boats, it is the theatre; and this arises more especially
from a disinclination on the part of most managers to allow people to
walk into their houses for nothing. In the gallery he is in his true
glory. His very elevated situation gives him a feeling of superiority,
and he is aware that his cry for an encore, or pleasant remark ad-
dressed to the orchestra, will have as much weight—nay, far more—
than if it proceeded from an occupant of the dress circle. Nobody
but himself can give that force of expression to “Now then, you cat-
gut-scrapers; strike up there " Next to the prompter, no one like
him can regulate the scene-shifters: the single word “higher,” is
sufficient to induce them to raise the obtrusive sky borders when
they are in the way of something at the back of the stage; and the
most independent actor feels called upon to display extra encrgy
when our hero shouts the dictatorial “speak up,” from his lofty posi-
tion. It is through his exertions, vocal and bodily, that a scat is
procured for his friend “Fluffy Jack,” who comes in at
half-price; and his “order,” and “turn him out,” are as ma-
gisterial commands to the attendant policemen. He rewards
any clever piece of mechanism, or agile leap of the harlequin
(for it must be stated that the pantomime chiefly attracts
him) by the appropriate exclamation, “Bravo, Rouse !” and he is one
of the most animated whistle solo performers on his two fingers that
you would meet with ; indeed, by some extraordinary anatomical
peculiarity it seems impossible for any one above the rank of a
butcher's apprentice, ever to produce the peculiar shrill note in ques-
tion. We, ourselves, have no hesitation in confessing that we have
tried to do it for hours together, and never got beyond a noise some-
what resembling that produced by blowing a pair of bellows into an
empty ginger-beer bottle.
A singular antipathy to work of any description, is a leading cha-
racteristic of the Street-Boy. This does not depend upon a lack of
perseverance, as he can play the castanets upon two pieces of slate
like a Duvernay in corduroys, spin a top or hurl a stone with unerring
effect, and produce tunes upon his cheeks and chin with singular pre-
cision ; all which evidences of skill must have cost him much pains
to acquire. Neither should we overlook the incomprehensible in-
genuity he displays in putting on his clothes, in which he generally
contrives to make one single button and a bit of string perform all
the function, which those of a higher grade require at least a dozen to
accomplish.
When the Street-Boy gives himself up to idle for the whole day on
the strength of a few accidental coppers, his favourite lounge is in
the vicinity of a baked potato-can—proprietors of which machine
appear of late to have established certain côteries and réunions around
them. He has minutely studied the economy of these al fresco res-
taurateurs. He sees the advantage of keeping the butter always to
leeward, and he knows the jet of steam, intended to be expressive of
intense caloric reigning amongst the potatoes, has nothing at all to
do with them—no more than the furious exhibition of vapour which
appears to proceed from the dog-tarts in the windows of the St.
Giles's confectioners.
The consumption of pickled whelks, oysters as big as soup-plates,
and immature apples or small black cherries depends chiefly upon his
patronage. When the Regent-street lounger fatiguod and thirsty
takes an ice at Very's, or some limonade gazeuse in the Pantheon, the
Street-Boy indulges in some curds and whey in Drury Lane, or a
bottle of penny ginger-beer in the New Cut. -
The only individual of whom the Street-Boy stands in awe is the
policeman. He looks upon all square-keepers and beadles as so many
large puppets to shoot his wit at ; but he is afraid of the policeman,
and there is no denying it. The only place where he throws off a
portion of his fear is, as we have stated, the gallery of the playhouse;
and then he relies principally upon his remote situation, or the prac-
tical difficulty of being approached through the unaccommodating
masses that surround him.
Our business at present is merely with the boy. When he grows

up he loses most of his attributes, and either becomes an errand
carrier or a light porter, perhaps even a policeman ; or, being de-
tected in various acts of unlawful appropriation, becomes a traveller,
and finishes his career by a grand tour to the regions of the Pacific
Ocean.
With this scion of the mobility—this small olive-branch of the
great unwashed, born to an inheritance of the courts and gutters—we
conclude the present Physiology. It has now extended to the average
length of the continuous papers we have been permitted to furnish
to the columns of our darling publication ; we bring it to a close,
not so much on account of having exhausted our resources, as from
the dread we have ever professed, of allowing any one subject to
become tedious and protracted—of treating it like a Vauxhall ham,
and making it cover an extended area, when the same quantity of
matter might have been collected into one small dish, and gone down
equally well. We expressed our fears, in the first chapter, at the new
plunge we were about to make into the uncertain ocean of opinion.
May we hope that we have come again in safety to the surface
whilst we admit, with a candid sense of justice, that when from time
to time a sudden cramp has seized our wits, the light sketches of our
talented artist have acted as corks or aquatic hats, and kept us
floating until we regained sufficient power to keep our head once
more above water.
And so, craving forgiveness from all those Idlers whom we have
endeavoured to portray, if we have offended them—always except-
ing the “Gents,” whom we continue to hold in the most supreme
contempt—we respectfully inform the world in general, (which of
course implies our subscribers,) that we intend allowing our brains
to lie fallow for the space of one week. In this period we shall buy
a new card of steel pens, a quire of outside post, and a sixpenny
bottle of ink; and then set to work once more with all the industry
we can command.
COMIC BALLADS FOR THE BOUDOIR.—No. VI.
AFTER THE BALL.
Scene.—A dressing-room. Sundry articles of female finery, a split pair of
gloves, a fading bouquet, &c., scattered about. Miss Augusta Montague has
just returned from a ball, and is addressing her sister in the next room, who
has been kept at home by the influenza.
PREPARING Fort the BALL.
My dearest Nell I don't go to sleep ;
We have had such a lovely ball.
I've been engaged four waltzes deep!
Come—wake up—and I'll tell you all.
But first, just let me take a glass
Of eau sucrée—I feel quite faint—
And three small drops of fleur d'orange.—
That Weippert's band would move a saint :
First with the blasé Count D’Etoffe
I dawdled through a grave quadrille
He'd nothing piquant—nothing new,
His routine of small talk to fill.
“”Tis very warm—the room how full—
I wish we next the door had stood.
You've heard the song of “Berlin Wool,’
Which Parry sings—'tis very good.
>:
“Our vis-à-vis is a fine guirl,
'Pon honour—very fine, I vow:
But then her hair is out of curl,
Though for the heat we must allow.
But curling fluid is not dear,
Nor pâté firé, and I hate
To see a girl with brow so clear
Her ringlets wear like “Crazy Kate.’”
Well—of his Countship I got rid,
And with a youth, moustached and tall,
Next through the gallopade I slid;
But his small talk was worsc than all.
“Seen the new ballet, Miss 1 they say
Cerito's gain’d one triumph more.
Tuesday I could not get away;
'Twas foreign post night—cursed bore!”
Then, through the giddy waltz I whirl’d
With such a love! his graceful air,
As breathless round the room we twirl’d
Made all exclaim “Sure such a pair
As that, before, were never scen—
So justly form'd hearts to subdue.”
I know his name—which l don't mean
To tell—not even, Nell, to you.
Ile held my hand – he clasp'd my waist—
Lightly encircled by his arm ;
Each step – each look—display'd the taste
That gives the waltz its highest cham.
But, oh! before the tune had ceased,
My sandal broke, and down I fell ;
(I was not frighten’d in the least,
But it too rudely broke the spell )
To tell the numbers else, with whom
Through the gay scene I sped along
The mazes of that wax-lit room –
The brightest of the glittering throng—
Mem'ry won't serve: I only know,
Mama, her accents elevating,
At six, cried, “Now, dear, we must go;
You've kept the Brougham three hours in waiting.”

MAGISTERIAL HAIR-CUTTERS.
LET any man, with even a moderate regard for his head of hair, eschew
a quarrel with his neighbour at Dover. The magistrates of that place
have, assuredly, a greater regard for the scissors than the scales; they
crop admirably, but we must confess, their pennyworths of justice are of
short weight. Let the reader judge.
A Fredcrick For Cooper, well known in the common sewerage of the
“literary” world (it was to his enterprise, we believe, that London was
a year or two ago indebted for an unsaveury periodical, named Paul
Pry), is at present the “proprietor” of Dover Theatre, shedding “his
purity of soul” upon the drama of a Cinque Port. Two of his unfortunate
| actors, Messrs. FitzJAMEs and GLADstone, had an altercation with the
manager touching some fiscal irregularity on his part. The quarrel rose
| to what Cooper swore to be an assault, which was duly settled for ten
shillings. Next came a charge on the part of the manager, wherein he
swore that “his life” had been threatened by the unpaid actors, who
were immediately required to find two sureties in 20l. each, to keep the
peace. In about three hours they found sufficient bail; and Cooper's life
(for two months at least) was safe.
Mark, however, what occurred in the three hours. The actors were
sent to gaol; and albeit the gaoler knew that bail would be found, he
“improved” the time by ordering his captives to be cropped close—
yes, shorn of their hair. This was done at two o'clock, and at three, bail
was offered and taken. All this came out in evidence before the
|Mayor's court: the “court was then cleared ; and after being in delibe:
ration a considerable time, the parties were called in, and the Mayor said
the bench had, after well weighing the evidence, coine to the conclusion
that the governor of the gaol was perfectly justified in ordering the hair
of the prisoners to be cut off; and, therefore, they dismissed the case.”
The excelling beauty of English prison discipline is its variety. It
| changes with the place. In Kent the magistrates only crop men's hair;
in another county, for aught we know, they may pull it out by the roots.
Certain we are, that in the case of Messrs. FitzJames and GLADSTONE, one
|operation would have been equally just with the other. Still, to make the
|discipline of Dover gaol complete, why does not the Mayor appoint a tooth-
drawer Actors without teeth would be especially well-suited to the Dover
|Theatre; for, if all we hear be true, such things are sheer superfluities in
the troop of Mr. Frederick For Coopert

THE NATURAL HISTORY OF COURTSIHIP.
chapTER xi.-CONCERNING COQUETTES.
A coquETTE is a graduate in the science of flirtation, who has
taken every degree from her alma-mater—who is so good a mistress
of arts that she no longer needs a tutor, and is competent to manage
her own affairs without the aid of a chaperon. Being, according to
Ben D'Israeli, a “Psycological curiosity,” she undergoes two changes
before arriving at maturity:-From the insect of the school-period
he becomes the chrysalis of the ball-room, whence she emerges from
beneath the wing of her chaperon to flutter forth the full-grown
butterfly, or coquette.
A finished coquette is pretty, intellectual, and very fond of waltz-
ing. She can, at a moment's notice, be intensely agreeable, or quietly
repellant; she can smile with one side of her face upon a new con-
quest, and frown with the other upon his waning rival. She has a
scale of attractions by which she measures her deportment towards
different individuals. To a younger son, with small prospects, she is
reserved and formal; to a captain of infantry, polite; to a ditto in
the Guards, condescending. She is affable to the heir-presumptive
of a rich title; affectionate and confiding to the heir-apparent ; but
to the title itself, perfectly bewitching ! She will walk a quadrille
with a county member, but will not, if possible, waltz with anything
under a peer. She can be spirituelle to a wit, grave to a parson, and
poetical to a minor. She knows instinctively the exact moment when
to commence a flirtation ; and—having no passion, no feelings—can
adroitly break off an ineligible one, even if the wedding liveries have
been ordered.
To play off her arts with the proper degree of confidence—of care-
lessness about the result—of that seeming indifference to success
which is the main element of success, the first duty of the coquette
is to provide herself with a stock-lover—one who is so devotedly
hers, that there is no fear of losing him even if all else should fail.
It was not,therefore, till the Honourable Mrs. Couple saw her protégée
excellently provided in this respect, in the person of Sir Charles
Simper, that she withdrew her valuable advice and services from
Miss Rose Robinson. With the pride of a professor, who sees his
pupil rise to celebrity and honour in his peculiar branch of learning,
did the delighted chaperon point to her scholar as a perfect coquette.
“A large party of fashionables,” observed the Morning Post of a
recent date, “are assembled at the seat of Lord Fallover, Fallover
Park, Staffordshire. The young earl seems determined to emulate
the hospitable liberality of his ancestors, for the following long list
of distinguished fashionables are at present his guests.” The names
of Miss Robinson, Sir Charles Simper, and P. Pleinpurse, Esq., con-
cluded the catalogue.
It was here that IRose evinced herself a perfect mistress of her art.
She had already nearly “entangled ” one of the richest commoners
ºn-
in England—a dandy and dilettante; but her success in that quarter
being doubtful, on account of the difficulty of managing a person so
inordinately vain as Mr. Pleinpurse, she, with a laudable ambition,
now aspired to her host. Lord Fallover was a fox-hunter and fancy
farmer, who cursed the opera, and comprehensively criticised the
whole of the fine arts as a bore; and her address, in sympathising with
the opposite tastes of these antipodes, won the admiration of some
of her fellow-guests, and the envy of others. She spent her morn-
ings in admiring Fallover's beagles, his patent ploughs, his enor-
mous turnips, his obese oxen. She learnt all the good points of a
horse, and praised his favourite hunters, as if she had graduated
amongst “Scott's lot,” and finished her training at Tattersall's. She
took the box-seat beside him when he drove his four-in-hand, and
attended every “meet” in a red riding-habit. -
Thus, all the morning she was Fallover's Diana; but in the evening
she became Pleinpurse's Euterpe. Then it was she melted her mel-
low tones into love songs, or raised her voice in the cery heroic duetts
of Donizetti. Then she was eloquent upon the sotto roce of Frezzolini,
the aplomb of Lablache, the tremulando of Rubini. In the evening
there was nothing she adored so much as music ; in the morning
brindle oxen were her passion; but just before dinner—when there
was nobody else to flirt with—it was the society of Sir Charles Sim-
per which she declared was so delightful.
The party was rapidly breaking up—her mama was on the eve of
returning—yet the Earl had not proposed. One last chance was
given him ;-he had bought a new horse, which was to be tried in the
tilbury, and Miss Robinson obtained the other seat in a drive round the
Park. Fallover was by no means a loquacious man, and the lady
made desperate efforts to draw him out by her own remarks :-
“What a beautiful country !—a paradise ! Thrice happy must be
his lot to possess so charming an estate.” And then, “A country life
—how perfect a millennium—how far more attractive than the dissi
pations of London " " (a heart-breaking sigh accompanied the ex-
clamation) Lord Fallover assented to all she said, and pulled up at
an elegant farm-house. With many apologies he borrowed a groom
to drive her back to the Hall—“He had business with his tenant, Mr.
Acres.”
Rose remembered that this identical tenant had a lovely daughter,
and determined to dine in London that day. Pleinpurse had offered
her mama and her seats in his carriage—(the servants could go to
town in Simper's)—and on arriving at the Hall the offer was
accepted.
That journey did wonders with Pleinpurse; and a week after the
affair was arranged, all but giving a handsome congé to Simper.
Rose would not, however, do so till the settlements had been actually
signed ; for no coquette is justified in turning off a lover till his
chance is hopeless. The Earl had married the farmer's daughter, to
the utter disgust of every chaperon and coquette of his acquaintance.
Leaving Miss Robinson for the present, let us remark, that whilst
the accomplished coquette wins our astonishment by the excess of
her ingenuity, her perfect nerve on occasions of the most startling
embarras, and her Protean changes of demeanour, -the clumsy mal-
adron flirt, who possesses all the desires without any of the arts of
coquetry, excites that which would come very near to contempt, if so
strong a word can be justly applied to any of the “angels of life.”
Inferior kinds of coquettes are only to be met with in inferior clas-
ses of society. They are known at a glance—they wear very low dresses
and large quantities of jewellery. They smell strongly of Rowland's
Kalydor, which is sometimes accompanied with a suspicion of poma-
tum. They talk a vast deal, and frequently laugh in spite of their
teeth. To their admirers they are guilty either of the most lavish
fondness or the most unpardonable rudeness. They make any en-
gagement that is offered, and break it without the smallest com-
punction. Flattery is their food, caprice their rule of conduct. In
a word, as the proficient coquette is the elegant, beautifully-tinted

existence as a chaperon—the latter as something worse; for coquetry
hovers so near the extremest edge of virtue's limits, that without the
vigilant exercise of the finest art, the boundary is sure to be over-
stepped.

LAURELS AT NINGPO.
“THEs E victories make me melancholy.” Such were wont to be
Abe RcnoMBIE’s words, when congratulated upon battles, won against
disciplined forces. The spirit of humanity rose above the trade of
the mere soldier, and showed to him the true value of bloodshed—
the rightful use of carnage. If any such feeling can operate on our
commanders at Ningpo, then must they be the most melancholy
creatures on the face of the earth. With scarcely more excitement
than is afforded to the English sportsmen by a covey of partridges,
the British soldier in China is compelled to cut the throats and blow
cut the brains of miserable wretches, brought by mandarins for
military slaughter | The odds at which the poor Chinese fight, the
mischief they do, compared with the destruction they suffer, make
the whole affair a ghastly, bloody farce, at which the devil himself
must laugh, even whilst the victorious Commander-in-chief narrates
in warlike phrase—in true Gazette-like grandiloquence—the terrible
disasters of the enemy I Listen to an “extract of a letter” to Sir H.
Gough, from Lieutenant-Colonel Morris. Ningpo was attacked on
the 10th of March by the enemy in great force; “but,” says the
English commander,
“I have much pleasure in informing you that both these assaults were
repulsed, although sustained with considerable daring, with immense loss
on the part of the assailants.”
We proceed with our “elegant extracts” from the book of glorious
War :-
“Upon arriving at the west gate, and finding how matters stood, I im-
mediately j the party in advance, and upon reaching the centre of
the suburb, the carnage was perfectly frightful.
We pursued the enemy for eight miles to the village of Sapee, where
we were stopped by the river, and in the course of the pursuit killed
considerable numbers / ''
Does not glorious Mars lose all his “dreadful loveliness,” and
stand before the reader as no other than a carcase-butcher
The “casualties”—that is, the effect of the courage and discipline
of the Chinese—amounted to—
“One man of the 18th Royal Irish, and two of the 49th regiment—
wounded !”
Possibly, they received black eyes, or, it may be, contused noses,
from the enemy, who was made to suffer for his temerity by the loss
of-" five or six hundred men l’’
Lieutenant-Colonel Montgomerie also sends in an account of his
part of the day's work :-
“The howitzer was brought to the front, and three rounds of grape in
quick succession told with tremendous effect 1 * * * Numerous parties de-
serted the main body at every turn, and we saw many throw themselves
into the canal, worn out with wounds and fatigue ! ”
And after these terrible doings, what, thinks the reader, was the
loss to our troops ? Simply, the loss of considerable perspiration in
the glorious pursuit.—Poor wretches 1 Imagine the howitzer pouring
in destruction amidst a mass of living human flesh—think of the
screams and agony of hundreds of “God’s image,” albeit the image
wore a pig-tail, and used chopsticks.
The affair by water was in no way less brilliant. Hear Sir W.
Parker, Rear-Admiral :-
“From the best accounts we have been able to collect, the Chinese
cannot have lost less than from 800 to 1,000 men slain, independently of
great numbers carried off wounded; among the former were several
mandarins, supposed to have held important positions in the army; many
prisoners also fell into our hands, and some interesting papers relative to
the present position of their affairs, and from accounts previously received,
and the amount of sycee silver afterwards found on the bodies of the dead,
there is no doubt that a considerable sum had been paid to them as an
encouragement to resist Her Majesty's forces, and that the troops we
encountered were composed of the élite of their army.
“It is with pain I have to transmit a list of 3 killed and 15 wounded
in the naval brigade, and amongst the latter many are severely hurt.”
“Three killed and fifteen wounded,” English, against “from 800 to
1000 Chinese 1" Is it not a war of howitzers to pop-guns :
A few days since, a correspondent of the “Times” suggested the
employment of a fire-engine in the disturbed districts; arguing that
the spirit of Chartism might be as effectually quenched by cold water,
as by the swords and bullets of dragoons. Whether such an engine
would be sufficiently effective on our Chinese enemies, we will not
say; but sure we are, we blush as Englishmen, and grieve as philo-
-
sophers, for the outlay of lead and powder in this fight for opium
Might not our forces be armed with police staves —for we are con-
vinced that English soldiers must feel mightily abashed as they pull
the trigger upon even “the élite” of the Chinese army, though made
still more valorous by a priming of “sycee silver.”
If the news of this glorious war reach the ghost of Rogen Bacon,
he will be ashamed of his gunpowder. It is a war without glory; a
war which, when ended, against such a foe, can give no laurels to the
victors: their most fitting chaplets will be wreaths of poppies.
LOYALTY AT SEA.
OUR friend, the Standard, has published a letter from the Captain of
the forecastle of the Royal George, descriptive of the late Royal voyage to
Scotland.
A Moving spectaclf.
Off Maplin lighthouse—“Hundreds of white pocket-handker-chiefs
which loyally fluttered in the breeze, and the thrilling cheers of an
equal number of manly hearts, proved their devoted attachment to their
lovely Queen. Foremost among them we distinguished a group of youth-
ful children, who having imbibed loyalty with their mother's milk, stretched
out their little arms towards their beloved sovereign, and lisped a blessing
on her Royal head.” We are delighted to find the number of pocket-
handkerchiefs exactly tallied with the manly hearts—each heart being pro-
vided with its pocket-handkerchief, and each having “loyalty” in its ve
web : we are also pleased with the devotion of the “ youthful children”
who had been wet-nursed upon monarchical principles (Russian babies,
we presume, “imbibe” pure despotism from the breast), and who
“lisped” a benison (the 8. of the forecastle distinctly hearing the
said lisp across the foaming sea) upon the Royal voyager | Even loyalty
may run mad, and rave most franticly
MARQUIS OF LONDONDERRY IN EDINBURGH.
It is to be expected that a Marquis of LoNDoNDERRY, writing (must we
call it writing ) of the Emperor of Austria, should proceed as follows:—
“The tranquil and sterling feeling of the Austrian people towards their
sovereign, induces them, when once he is proclaimed, to consider him
perfect, if not sublime !” It is as natural for LoNDoNDERRY to say this,
as for a goose to gaggle—we expect no other. The Marquis, true to the
|old creed of the right divine of kings, considers the Emperor of Austria
to be sublimated above the common clay of humanity; it was this belief
that taught the public mind to expect health from the miraculous hand of
the sovereign: the king—the direct agent of God—touched away the evil;
it was the very test of legitimacy—the gift vouchsafed only to the Lord's
anointed. Kings, however, have lost this healing virtue: they are no
longer considered the vicegerents of Heaven, pleading “the right divine
to govern wrong,” but as magistrates, answerable to the people. Now, if
ever—since the days of Alfred—there were a sovereign above the slang
of loyalty (for loyalty has its slang, and that of a most sickening kind; )
it is Queen Victoria. We would not have her pure and noble character
approached by crawling servility—we would not have her name thus
familiarly associated with the name of the Highest :—
“To The Glory of God, IN HoNour of The
QUEEN 1–”
Such is the commencement of the inscription on the plate deposited in the
stone—the first stone—laid a few days since at Edinburgh, of the Victoria
Hall.
We are aware that the Marquis of LondoNDERRY has, by his recent
work—to which in our last we attempted to do all reasonable honour—
acquired a literary reputation, peculiarly his own. Nevertheless, with both
our hands, we do protest against any future employment of the noble
Marquis as inscription writer to any public building—beyond that of a
new station-house: for that the Marquis has been dabbling at Edinburgh,
is but too plain—every syllable of the above rings and speaks of London-
DERRY. Loyalty is a noble feeling; but loyalty itself may consider a
Monarch a little too essential to the “glory of God.”

LONDON INTERIORS.
No. VI.-TEMPLE BAR.
This extraordinary piece of architecture has frequently been the
subject of description, as far as its exterior is concerned ; but the
antiquarian has never gone beyond the outside of Temple Bar—and,
in a word, he has never regularly walked into it. The superficial ob-
server has been in the habit of regarding Temple Bar as the great
defence of the City of London; and it is true that should there be an
insurrection at the West End, or if a horde of rude barbarians should
rush down from the recesses of Holy well Street, or if an invading
fleet should anchor off the coast of Essex (Street), and pour their
crews of marauders into the Strand—then and then only may the
citizens look to the shutting up of Temple Bar—for, as we once heard
a young nine-year-old Young Norval declare, “thafety and for
thuccour.”
It is not, however, with the outside of Temple Bar that we have
now to do, for it is the interior that claims our notice. On the left-
hand side, proceeding from the West End, is a small low door, upon
which the enormous figure of 3 is conspicuously placed, which, upon
nearer inspection, turns out to be a portion of abold and rigorous notice,
that gentlemen's hair is cut for the number of pence which the figure
denominates. A little to the left is an enormous on E ; but we blush
for human nature when we write it—that one is a bold-faced liar, for he
has falsehood in his heart, in the shape of an insidious picked in
upon a ground of black (the appropriate colour of deceit), in figures
of white, which, alas ! cannot give its hue to the lie in question. No,
we cannot forgive the attempt to lure the public to an easy shave
at a penny, when the dastardly and sneaking halfpenny, skulking like
a white-livered coward in the black bosom of the oNE, converts into
three-halfpence the charge for a rapid rasp beneath the razor.
But, to drop the lofty style which indignation has engendered, let
us do justice to Tanner, the proprieter, who does not falsify his
promise of “ease and comfort in shaving,” for his razor, like the
foot of the nymph which leaves no trace upon the sand,
“Skims o'er the beard, and yet no gashes seen.”
neck-or-nothing.
The exterior of Temple Bar is greatly indebted to the taste of
Tanner, who has considerably heightened the effect of the architec-
ture by throwing in a tracery of tooth-brushes to his window; and
he has fitted up the upper pane, or architrave, with a very fanciful
fretwork of blacking-bottles, which finish off the fundamental base of
the building. At the city side he has succeeded in introducing the
plain Doric, or door-ic, column with some effect, for he has cleverly
rounded the door-post, and he has placed a waxen bust, of great
ferocity, with its dark eye and livid nose looking towards the
east, while a vivid imagination easily turns the bust into a represen-
tation of the Roman warrior contemplating the degenerate citizens.
A yard of red moreen window curtain thrown in a graceful fold over
the neck and bosom of the man of war, renders the illusion complete,
and we recognise at once the Roman toga in the cheap remnant from
Swan and Edgar's.
But let us hasten to the interior. We are inside Temple Bar.
What recollections arise around us, what associations spring up on
every side It was here that Caesar knocked and rang, kicked and
hallooed, at the head of his cohorts, and at last retired, upon dis-
covering that he had only to lead his troops up Pickett-street and
down Chancery Lane, which brought him to exactly the same point
as he could have arrived at by going through the gate, while the
citizens themselves, surprised at the entrance of the enemy, took
refuge in the Temple, It was here that the Aldermen of London
first learned the humiliating fact, that while the civic authorities
could hug themselves in possession of the keys of the city—the lessee
of the northern wing might at any time defeat their precautions, by
throwing open the western and eastern doors of his shop, which
would establish a thoroughfare and a thorough draft between the
west end and the city.
We remember when the wing in question had fallen into the
hands of one who openly sneered at the arrogance of the citizens.
It was expected that he would have baffled the intention of the
mayor to give William IV. the trouble of knocking at the city gates,
by passing his majesty quietly through the shop, which was then used
as an office for the sale of cheap periodicals. That Tanner would
level himself to such a collusion with the sovereign of the West,
in depreciation of the prerogative claimed by the monarch of the
East, we are unwilling to believe, for he has been heard to say,
that in the words of Desdemona, he does acknowledge “a divided
duty,” being loyal alike to Pirie the First, and to Queen Victoria.
We have gone so deeply into historical and political reflection,
Going Thruough THICK OR THIN.
that we have hardly left ourselves space to speak of the interior of
Temple Barat so much length as the importance of the subject would
seem to require. On reaching the inside you perceive a couple of
chairs, while from a nail on the northern wall depends a piece of
drapery which serves the purpose of a jack-towel, and which runs
round on a roller, and is changed during the week so as to allow about
three square inches of clean towel to each customer. The customer is
generally assisted by Tanner himself in a search for a secluded or
rather a spotless spot, upon the towel alluded to, and we must do him
the justice to allow, that he is a very Columbus in pouncing at once
upon the tracts which no human face has yet lighted on.
But the charm of the place—the genius loci—is the lessee himself,
who always entertains the visiter with a lecture on the geography of
the interesting premises. “Sir” he exclaims, as he holds his customer
back by the nose or whisker, “keep your head so—just one minute-
for you'll hardly believe that while you are in this position your head
is in London, and your heels is in Middlesex.” It is at least satisfac-
tory to obtain this information; for when one is thrust violently back
and held down by an enthusiast with an open razor in his hand, one
is apt to forget all about one's head or one's heels, and which it is we
may be at the moment standing on.
Such is the interior of Temple Bar, and such its present occupant.
Both are objects of interest, and will well repay a visit.
LIBRARIES FOR THE POLICE.
It will be seen that somebody has been suggesting the establishment of
Libraries for the Police ; and if it is desirable that “those who run may
read,” we think it only fair that those who run after them should read
also. There is no doubt that the Police in general are not remarkable
for that literary refinement which it is now sought to impart; and, though
some of the Inspectors exhibit in their charge-sheets a terseness and
nervousness of style that would do credit to Johnson—we mean the
doctor, not the informer—though perhaps the doctor was, after all, the
greater informer of the two-still we say, in spite of some of these
charge-sheets, which might place a portion of the Police literature of the
country on a par with the very highest efforts of the same kind, there is
nevertheless room for improvement, and consequently much occasion for
Libraries.
It is really an anomaly that a body-of men whose sole pretension to a
mark and likelihood is derived from the alphabet, should have so little
acquaintance with letters. But so it is, for in vain do we endeavour to
constitute our Police force a really lettered body, if, with vowels on their
cuffs, consonants on their collars, mutes on their lanterns, and liquids—
too frequently—in their mouths, we do not engrave Grammar on their
hearts, and imprint Syntax on their memories.
It may be asked, how is education to aid a policeman in the discharge
of his duty We gladly take up the anonymous gauntlet by answering
the question in the usual way—by putting another. How is a policeman
to interfere with confidence in a dispute between man and wife, if he is
not aware of the true force of the copulative conjunction, and its in-

fluence in giving a peculiar license to the male, enabling him to rebuke
—or even in stringent cases to wallop—the female with impunity. From
his grammar, also, the policeman may learn that he is often warranted in
declining when others have conjugated. In quarrels between relations
he again may have recourse to his grammar, and looking up with dili-
gence the article relative, he may see, in case of a row, how far a police-
man ought to shut his ears, and maintain the character of the article

Syntax, too, might be arranged in such a manner as to give him a
correct notion of the tax on sin, or the punishment due to different
offences.
But we might pursue the subject to all eternity, though we think we
have done enough to show that Libraries for the Police, are, like the Latin
vocatives—wanting. -
LONDONERS AND LIONS.
A Night or two since, we overheard the following dialogue between a
fiddler at the English Opera-house and one of the audience § bald-headed
man) in the pit.
Fiddler.—Good evening, sir. Come to see Mr. Carter's lions again
Ha, sir! you are a real patron of the drama. I only wish all London
was full of such as you.
Bald-headed Man.—Yes, here I am again; and if the lions are shown
for a twelvemonth, here you’ll find me every night.
Fiddler.—It does me good to hear you say so, sir. Every night, eh?
Bald-headed Man.—I wouldn't miss one night for any consideration ;
and I'll tell you the reason : as I am morally certain that some night the
lion will bite Carter's head off, I know my luck, that would be the very
night I was away.
his (thought we) is the very source of the Lion King's success.
People do not visit the playhouse to see this man dominate over the lion,
but with the latent hope, a fluttering expectation, that the lion may master
the man. Folks are not all so ingenuous as our bald-headed friend—they
scarcely avow, even to themselves, what it is that carries them to the
show; but disguise it as they may, it is their sense of danger for the man,
not their curiosity towards the lion.

What made people, throng to see Scott, the diver, play tricks with a
halter from the bridges 1 - Why, the feeling of peril he was in—the belief
that he might hang himself: and our readers will recollect that in the
end the worthy sight-seers were not disappointed. When the dead body
of Scott was carried to the hospital, people felt they had had their full
shilling's worth. So, when some night Mr. Carter's lion drops Mr.
Carter's head upon the stage, our bald-headed friend (with others of his
kidney) may rise serenely from his seat, and say—“I’m satisfied.”

When one of the Lords in Waiting presented the Queen with a biscuit,
his Lordship was pitched by a sudden lurch on to that end which is
technically , called his beam –. Her Majesty, on observing this,
requested that further ceremony might be dispensed with, as Neptune
was evidently determined upon waving it.

SOOT AND SENTIMENT.
High on the summit of a mansion's dome,
Where rank and luxury had made their home,
And pleasure with profusion well might cloy,
High on that mansion sat an artless boy.
The youth was dark of feature, in his face
None could the hue of health or sickness trace ;
His cheeks did evermore one colour keep—
For oh! that urchin was a chimney-sweep !
He sat ; his head appeared the sky to dot,
As it emerged from out the chimney-pot:
Pensive he seemed—then raised his arms so taper,
And made rough music with his brush and scraper.
Ah little thought the cold unfeeling crowd,
When listening to that brush and scraper loud,
That he who raised the noise, and seem'd so gay,
Was unto sentiment a wretched prey :
For, as his eye along the roof he ran,
Thus to himself that pensive boy began.—
“'Tis over now, I know the thing is done;
The Act is pass'd—my “occupation's gone!’
The Queen has been cajoled of her consent
To that vile act of wiler Parliament,
By which it is decreed (be still, my brain )
That climbing boys shall never climb again.”
He spoke, and down his cheeks the big tears roll,—
Pearls of deep feeling—rain drops of the soul.
His black lip quiver'd, and his bristly hair
Stood out on end—the fringe of true despair.
Fierce passions from his redd'ning eye-balls dart,
His lids with soot and tears alternate smart; -
When straight a voice cried “An’t you coming, ho?”
To which that boy replied “Look out below !”
Then, clasp'd his hand—the chimney being swept,
That pensive urchin down the brickwork crept.

Long years had pass'd, that boy became a unau,
For him the sand of time too swiftly ran.
His faith in sweeping had been sorely tried,
He bought a birch-broom, swept the streets, and died.

PUNCH2S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER IX.-ON THE “BEAUTY " AND “LUXURY” OF TRUTH.—THE
UnALLOYED GUINEAS.
So, my dear child, you have had enough of philosophy—have read
enough of the speculations of the Hermit of Coney-Hatch, to feel that
your yearnings for solitary contemplation were but a passing weak-
ness; to know, that it is in the bustling world about you, true wisdom
finds its best, its most enduring reward. Parchment, my dear child,
though writ and illuminated with all the glories of the human brain,
is a perishable commodity: now, gold in bars will last till the world
cracks.
I now come to the principal subject of your last letter, “the
beauty of Truth.”
My dear boy, truth is no doubt a very beautiful object; so are
diamonds, pearls, rubies, emeralds; but, like those sparkling, precious
things, it is by no means necessary to your condition of life, and if
sported at all, is only to be enjoyed by way of luxury. Beware, lest
a vain conceit should ruin you! The nobleman, the man of inde-
pendence, may speak truth, as he may wear a brilliant in his breast
worth a hundred guineas.-Now, as you must be content with at best
n bit of Bristol-stone, with a small imitation of the lustrous reality,
so, in like way, can you not afford to utter the sparkling commodity
at all times. Do not suppose, however, that I would have you never
speak the truth. Pray, do not misunderstand me. You may, as a
man of the world, and a trader who would turn the prudent penny,
you may always speak the truth when it can be in no way to your
advantage to utter the contrary.
At the same time, my beloved boy, take heed that you obtain not
the evil reputation of a liar. “What 1” I think I hear you exclaim
—“your advice, papa, involves a contradiction.” By no means.
What I wish to impress upon you, is the necessity of so uttering your
verbal coinage, that to the superficial eye and careless ear, it may
have all the appearance, all the ring of the true article. Herein con-
sists the great wisdom of life. The thousands who have grown rich
by its application to all their worldly concerns are incalculable. The
world, as at present constituted, could not go on without lying. And,
I am convinced, it is only the full conviction of this fact that enables
so many worthy, excellent people, to club their little modicum of
daily falsehood together, for the benevolent purpose of keeping the
world upon its axis.
For a moment, consider the effect produced in London alone, if
from to-morrow morning, for one month only, every man, woman,
and child were to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth. You have read of towns besieged, of cities sacked, of the
unbridled fury of a sanguinary soldiery; but all this would be as
sport to the horrors of this our most civilised metropolis. . Gracious
Plutus ! Think of the bankruptcies 1 Imagine the confessions of
statesmen . Consider the internal revelations of bishops | Only
reflect upon the thousands and thousands of at present—most re-
spectable, exemplary people, congregated in the highways and mar-
ket-places, making a “clean breast” to one another-each man
shocking his neighbour with the confession of his social iniquity, of
his daily hypocrisy, of his rascal vice that he now feeds and cockers
like a pet snake in private If all men were thus to turn themselves
inside out, the majority of blacks would, I fear, be most alarming.
We might have Hottentot chancellors, and Ethiopian bishops
A wise German, named Goethe, has observed—“There is some-
thing in every man, which if known to his fellow, would make him
hate him.” How, then, could the world go on with this reciprocal
passion of hatred 1 Philosophic statesmen, conscious of this fact,
have therefore leavened every social institution with a necessary and
most wholesome amount of falsehood. Hence, too, we have what are
called legal fictions. Hence, Justice, the daughter of Truth, de-
bauched by Law, gives, with a solemn smirk, short weight to the poor,
and a lumping pennyworth to the rich.
What are the fees paid to hungry, hundred-handed office, but
offerings exacted by falsehood What is the costliness of Justice,
but the wilful, wicked extravagance of lying—the practical mendacity
of life? Truth, by a paradoxical fiction, is painted naked ; and
Justice is robed in plain, unspotted white Why, the old harridan
must have as many gewgaws—as many big-beaded necklaces—
brooches—pins—chains and armlets, as the wife of a Jew bailiff.
These things she must have, or what does she with the presents
made to her—the fees exacted 1
I tell you again and again, all truth will not do in this world. I
will give you a short story, in illustration of the reality of this.
How, or by what accident, they escaped from the Mint, was never
known, but certain it is, that one hundred guineas of pure gold,
without the least alloy, were once upon a time issued to the world.
Old Gregory Muckly, by chance, obtained half-a-dozen pieces of
these coin, which, together with a few other pieces, were carefully
hoarded in a worsted stocking; and when Gregory the elder was
safely deposited in church-yard clay, they became the rightful
property of his son Hodge.
Hodge was a simple, honest creature ; caring nothing for the
pomps of the world;
“The sum of all his vanity, to deck
With one bright bell some fav’rite heifer's neck.”
Business, however, brought Hodge to London. Well, before he
returned to Gammon Farm, he would purchase a London present—
a bran new scarlet shawl for sister Suke. Two guineas did Hodge,
with fraternal self-complacency, set apart for this gift. Caught by
the truthful assurance exhibited in a mercer's window that the stock
was “selling off under prime cost,” Hodge thought he was sure of at
least a three-guinea shawl for two. Hereupon, he entered the shop;
rolled his eyes from side to side, seeking the radiant present for
sister Suke.
“Have you a nice, bran new scarlet shawl for two guineas " asked
Hodge.
“Sir” replied the shopkeeper, “you come at a lucky moment: we
have the most delicious article—the most wonderful scarlet. To
anybody else, sir, it would be three guineas and a half; but as you
have frequently been a customer to us”—
“Nay, nay,” cried Hodge—“I was never here before.”
“I beg your pardon, sir; humbly beg your pardon—another gen-
tleman like you,” said the tradesman.
“I’m no gentleman neither,” said Hodge; “and all I want is, you
to show me the shawl.” -
“There, sir,” said the mercer, throwing the shawl upon the counter;
“ there's a scarlet.”
“Ha! haſ so it be—like a poppy,” chuckled Hodge.
“A poppy, sir—a poppy's brickdust to it,” said the tradesman.
“Nay, nay, not so,” cried Hodge; “and I think I’ve seen more
poppies than thee.”
“Ha! haſ no doubt, sir—very true. Well, I assure you, to any-
body else this article would be three guineas and a half; but to you,
we'll say two.”
“There they be,” said Hodge; and he laid down the two unalloyed

As the tradesman took up the coin, a shadow fell upon his face;
and turning to his shopman, he whispered, “Run for a constable.”
Then addressing himself to Hodge, he said—“Walk this way if you
please.”
In two minutes Hodge was in the mercer's back parlour; in five,
in the custody of a constable; and in ten more, arraigned before a
magistrate, being charged with an attempt to pass off bad money.

pieces upon an honest tradesman,—really " and the mercer was
bursting with indignation.
Hodge's defence was not listened to, and he was sent to gaol for
two days until a proper officer from the Mint could be in attendance
to pronounce judgment on the suspected guineas. -
“Indeed, this is curious,” said Mr. Testem, the Mint functionary.
“But I don't wonder at your suspicions: the fact is, these guineas
are too good.” Mr. Testem then narrated that a hundred pieces of coin,
of pure, unalloyed gold, had been accidentally issued, and that Hodge's
two guineas were of them.
My son, he who in this world resolves to speak only the truth,
will speak only what is too good for the mass of mankind to under-
stand, and, like Hodge, will be persecuted accordingly.

THE LATE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
A little while ago Lord Hill retired on account of ill-health from the
office of Commander-in-Chief, and we are told by the papers that “his
friends and medical attendants entertained serious apprehensions for his
recovery.” We are glad, however, to perceive, that his Lordship's health
is nearly restored, though the cure seems to be rather a strange one, and
would appear to be connected with a public-house of some celebrity. It is
stated that the noble and gallant Lord exclaimed, that the sight of the
Wrekin had put him all to rights; and if he felt so comfortable on the
outside, there is no doubt that his cosey condition was greatly increased
when he had discussed a few of the internal resources of that well-known
place of public entertainment in Broad-Court.

The Surreyhounds met in the New Cut at Catsmeat-corner every

A most interesting rowing match between two empty coal barges

with steamers and other craft, who, however, did not seem to have
come out expressly to witness the match, which excited very little
attention from any one. The colours of the combatants were black
and lead-colour. They started from London-bridge, when black
taking the lead, floated in stately style against the Nymph steamer;
while lead-colour, with superhuman energy, attempted to feather his

all sides, by the paddle of the Naiad. Black now took up the rowing

SPORTING:ANECDOTES of PRINCE ALBERT DURING HIS
LATE TOUR.
PRINCE ALBERT, during his late visit to Scotland, had an opportunity
of enjoying the sports peculiar to the country, and he devoted a day or
two to the noble amusement of Deer-stalking. While on one of these ex-
peditions, he was accompanied by a nobleman of the suite whose dress
was rather suited to the royal reception rooms than to the field, a circum-
stance which gave rise to a joke from Prince Albert in (as George Robins
would say of a double bidding), “two places.” The first occasion arose
on the dandy nobleman placing his eye officiously to the muzzle of the
Prince's gun, to see that it was properly loaded, just as his Royal High-
ness was taking his aim to fire. “Take care, my lord,” exclaimed the
Prince, “lest in aiming at one buck I have the misfortune to kill
another.” . The attendant yager laughed so heartily at the joke that the
wood re-echoed with his boisterous merriment. The other joke consisted of
a pleasant equivoque, in allusion to the dogs in attendance and the noble-
man already referred to, when his Royal Highness brought in with consi-
derable tact a biteing sarcasm on the analogy between a dandy and a puppy.
We are unable to give the pleasantry at length; but the effect on the
yager is said to have been terrible.

withdrew without effecting a transfer.

THE PENNY-A-LINER.
HE rearing his fortunes (such as they are)
upon misfortunes; spinning out his days by
the sudden termination of those of a neigh-
bour; boarding and lodging upon accidents
and offences; finding fire from an inunda-
tion, and light from a source whence “the
vital spark had fled;” what a juggling para-
dox, what a strange career is the life of a
penny-a-liner . He seeth his way through
he world best when the fogs of November
come on ; and when a gentleman disappear-
E eth under water, it keeps the penny-a-liner
above it. He breakfasts on a “curious co-
incidence ;” dines on a murder; is enabled to have his glass of
grog because a reputable householder hath quaffed one of laudanum ;
and by the help of a conflagration which burns a street down, the in-
habitants out, and everything else up, he passeth his “other shirt”
through the unwonted ceremony of a wash-tub.
Mark him as he passeth along the Strand—the coat is seedy, but
it fits close, and yet—to the hunchback Bean doth he owe it—the
trousers, are they not relics of ? and the four-and-nine goss

A thunder-storm “visits” the metropolis, and thus the penny-a-
liner is enabled to visit Gravesend—on the way a “catastrophe” is
melted into a bottle of stout, and a something “strange but true” is
the cause from which a plate of cold meat resulteth.
When the wind blows a hurricane, the devil is proverbially busy;
but the penny-a-liner outstrips him. He knoweth by unfailing instinct
where a stack of chimneys have fallen ; and as soon as the removal
of three tons of rubbish allows him a view of an old lady's head with
a fractured skull he pulls out his note-book, and questioneth her
minutely as to her name, what she was doing, and how she felt when
the chimneys came through the roof.
A vague whisper of a railway accident is heard, and straight the
penny-a-liner is thrown, in his own words, into a “state of the greatest
excitement.” Visions of “further particulars,” of “another account”
rush upon him. He thinks upon indefinitely adjourned coroners,
inquests, and his heart is glad.

But, gentle reader, after all, think not too ill of the craft. They
undergo much labour of the body, and some of the mind. Theirs is
a hard and a precarious life—a life of unremitting exertion and deep
anxiety; and many there be among them, with spirits ground down
with toil, and sick with hope deferred, who might well become a
loftier sphere. They commit faults indeed; but they must eat—their
wives and children must eat. Do not, then, think too ill of them, and

MISS TICKLETOBY'S LECTURES ON
ENGLISH HISTORY.
EDWARD I.-The Scots AND THEIR CLAIMs.
COTCHMEN, my dears, you know
are my antipathy, and I had at one ||
time thought, in these lectures, of so
demolishing the reputation of William
Wallace, that historians would never
more have dared to speak about him,
and the numbers who hear me, the
millions who read me in PUNch, the
countless myriads who in future ages
will refer to that work when we, young
and old, are no more, would have seen
at once that the exploits ascribed to
him were fabulous for the most part,
and his character as doubtful as his
history.
Some late writers have been very
hard upon him. Dr. Lingard, espe-
cially, has fallen foul of his claims
to be a hero; and another author, Mr.
Keightley, has
from the old chroniclers strongly defamatory of Wallace's
character. One of these calls him, “quidan latro publicus,” a certain
common thief; another, writing his family, says he was “cº inftmá
gent, procreatus”—sprung from the lowest of the low; but these
writers, it must be remembered, were of the English nation and way
of thinking. Washington was similarly abused during the American
war; and I make no doubt that some of my darlings, who read the
English newspapers, have seen exactly the same epithets applied to
Mr. Daniel O'Connell. -
It is easy to call names in this way, but let us, my beloved young
friends, be more charitable ; in the case of these Scots especially,
for if we take Wallace from them, what hero do we leave to the poor
creatures Sir Walter Scott has, to be sure, invented a few good
Scotchmen in his novels, and perhaps their actions, and those of
Wallace, are equally true.
But even supposing that he did come of a low stock,-that he was
a freebooter once, it is clear that he came to command the Scotch
armies, that he was for a short time Regent of the kingdom—so much
the more creditable to him then was it, that, by his skill and valour,
he overcame those brave and disciplined troops that were sent against
him, and raised himself to the position he occupied for a while over
the heads of a powerful, ignorant, cowardly, sordid, treacherous,
selfish nobility, such as that of the Scots was.
Even poor John Baliol made one or two attempts to rescue his
crown from the domineering Edward, but these nobles, though they
conspired against the English king, were the first to truckle down to
him when he came to assert what he called his right; and the proof
of their time-serving conduct is, that King Edward forgave every

one of them, except Wallace, who was the only man who refused to
come to terms with the conqueror.
During the king's absence Wallace had tolerable success; he dis-
comfited the English leaders in many small skirmishes and surprises,
and defeated, at Cambuskenneth, a great body of the English troops.
He thought, too, to have as easy work with the king himself, when
Edward, hearing of his Lieutenant's defeat, came thundering down
to avenge him. But the Scot was no match for the stern English
warrior. At Falkirk the king gave Wallace's army such a beating
as almost annihilated it, and Wallace was obliged to fly to the woods,
where he was finally seized by one of his former friends and adhe-
rents; and, being sent to London, there died the death of a traitor.
Be warned then, my little dears, when you come to read the His-
tory of the Scottish Chiefs, by my dear friend Miss Porter, that
William Wallace was by no means the character which that charming
historian has depicted, going into battle, as it were, with a tear in
his eye, a cambric handkerchief in his hand, and a flounce to his
petticoat; nor was he the heroic creature of Tytler and Scott;
nor, most probably, the ruffian that Doctor Lingard would have him
to be.

He appears, it is true, to have been as violent and ferocious a soldier
as ever lived ; in his inroads into England murdering and ravaging
without pity. But such was the custom of his time; and such being
the custom, as, we excuse Wallace for murdering the English, we
must excuse Edward for hanging Wallace when he caught him.
Hanging and murdering, look you, were quite common in those days;
nay, they were thought to be just and laudable, and I make no doubt
that people at that period who objected to such murders at all, were
accused of “sickly sentimentality,” just as they are now, who pre-
sume to be hurt when the law orders a fellow-creature to be killed
before the Old Bailey. Well, at any rate, allow us to be thankful
that we do not live in those days, when each of us would have had a
thousand more chances of being hanged than now. There is no sickly
sentimentality about such a preference as that.
Let us allow, then, the claims of Wallace to be a hero and patriot.
Another hero arose in Scotland after Wallace's discomfiture, who
was more lucky than he ; but stern King Edward of the Longshanks
was dead when Bruce's triumphs were secured; and his son, Edward
of Carnarvon, was making-believe to reign.
This Bruce had been for a long time shilly-shallying as to the side
he should take ; whether he should join his countrymen over whom
he might possibly become king; or whether he should remain faithful
to King Edward, and not risk his estates or his neck. The latter
counsel for some time prevailed ; for amongst other causes they had
to take sides against their country, a chief one was, hatred of the
Baliols. When John of Baliol died, his son being then a prisoner in
London, a nephew of John Baliol, called Comyn of Badenoch, became
the head man in Scotland. He had always been found gallantly in
arms against King Edward, doing his duty as a soldier in Falkirk
fight, and in many other actions, with better or similar fortune—not
sneaking in the English camp as Bruce was.
The king, however, who had pardoned the young man many times,
at last got wind of some new conspiracies in which he was engaged,
and vowed, it was said, to make away with him. Bruce got warning
in time, made for Scotland, called a meeting with the Regent, Comyn
of Badenoch, who granted the interview, and hereupon Bruce mur-
dered Comyn in God’s church, and at once proclaimed himself King
of Scotland. The Scotch historians have tried to apologise as usual
for this foul and dastardly assassination, saying that it was done in a
heat—unpremeditated, and so forth. Nonsense, my loves; Robert
Bruce had been shuffling and intriguing all his life. He murdered
the man who stood between him and the crown—and he took it, and
if you read Sir Walter Scott’s “Lord of the Isles,” you will see what
a hero he has made of him. O these Scotchmen these Scotchmen
how they do stand by one another
Old Edward came tearing down to the borders on the news, vowing
he would kill and eat Robert Bruce ; but it was not so ordained;
the old king was carried off by a much more powerful enemy than
any bare-legged Scot; and his son, Edward of Carnarvon (who reigned
1307-1327), had not the energy of his father; and though he made
several attempts to punish the Scots, was usually left in the lurch by
his nobility, and on one occasion, at Bannockburn, cruelly beaten by
them. They have made a pretty pother about that battle, I warrant you,
those Scots; and you may hear sailors from Glasgow or Paisley still
crow and talk big about it. Give the fellows their battle, my dears; we
can afford it—(Great sensation). As for the murderer, Robert Bruce,
he was, it must be confessed, a wary and gallant captain—wise in
good fortune, resolute in bad, and he robbed the English counties to
the satisfaction of his subjects. It is almost a pity to think he
deserved to be hanged.
During the dissensions in England, Robert Bruce, having pretty
well secured Scotland, took a fancy to Ireland too — invaded the
country himself, came rather suddenly back again, and sent his
brother Edward, who even had the impudence to be crowned King of
Ireland: but the English forces coming up with him, took his crown
from him with his head in it—and so ended the reigns of the Bruces
in Ireland.
As for Edward of Carnarvon, little good can be said of him or his
times. An extravagant, idle king, insolent favourites (though
Gaveston, it must be confessed, was a gallant and dashing fellow),
bullying greedy barons, jealous that any one should have power but
themselves, and, above all (alas ! that I should have to say it), an
infamous, disreputable wretch of a French wife, fill the whole pages
of this wretched king's reign, with their quarrels, their vices, and their
murders. In the midst of their quarrels, they allowed the country to
be bullied by the French, and even the Scots; the people were racked
and torn by taxes and tyranny ; the king was finally deposed, and
murdered by the intrigues of his wicked vixen of a wife, who did not,
however, enjoy her ill-gotten honours long as regent of the kingdom.
Edward the Third came to the throne, and of him we will speak in the
next lecture.
In the year 1356, the Black Prince, who had commenced his career
ten years earlier as a gallant young soldier at Crécy, had an opportunity
of achieving for himself a triumph to the full as great as that former
famous one. Robbing and murdering for ten years, as he had been,
he had become naturally a skilful captain; and now, in 1356, say the
historians, having left his chief city of Bordeaux with 12,000 men,
crossing the Garonne, overrunning Querci, the Limousin, Auvergne,
and Berri, slaughtering the peasantry, destroying the corn, wine, and
provisions, and burning the farm-houses, villages, and towns, he was
surprised near Poictiers, in the province of Poitou, by a large army,
led by King John of France. The French army was very large—that
of the Black Prince very small. “Heaven help us,” said his Royal
Highness; “it only remains for us to fight bravely.”
He was, however, so doubtful as to the result of the action, that he
sent rather modest proposals to the French king, offering to give up
his plunder and prisoners, and to promise not to serve against France
for seven years, if the French would but let him off this time. King
John, however, replied, that he must have the Black Prince and a

hundred of his chief knights as prisoners, before he would listen to
any terms of accommodation, which idea his Royal Highness “in-
dignantly rejected.”
He beat the King of France, whose goods he was carrying off; he
killed his friends who came to help the king, he drove the king's
servants away; he took King John to England, and would not let
him return to France again until he had paid an enormous sum for
his ransom. And this was the man who called upon heaven to defend
the right ! Ah, my dears, there is not a crowned ruffian in Europe
who has not uttered the same cry these thousand years past, attesting
heaven in behalf of his unjust quarrel, and murdering and robbing
with the most sacred of all names in his mouth.
Perhaps the most annoying part of the whole imprisonment to poor
King John must have been the abominable politeness and humility
of his captor. Taken prisoner, and his grand army routed by a handful
of starving brigands, the king was marched to supper in the con-
queror's tent, the Prince complimented him by saying that his victory
was all chance, that the king ought to have won it (and so he ought
and no mistake), and that his majesty was the “garland of chivalry.”
Nor would he sit down in his majesty's presence—not he— he said
he was the subject and only fit to wait upon the king (to wait upon
him and rob him), so he fetched the dishes, drew the corks and per-
formed all the duties of his Majesty's yellowplush.

His conduct in carrying his prisoner to London, was of the same
sort. He had a triumphal entry: the king being placed on a great
horse, the prince meekly riding a pony beside him, and all the
people, of course, shouting “long live the prince.” What humility
cry the historians, what noble conduct No no my loves, I say it
was sham humility, the very worst sort of pride; if he wanted to spare
his prisoner's feelings why didn't the prince call a hackney-coach
In the year 1376, twenty years after his victory of Poictiers, the
gallant Black Prince, (who in France and Spain, at the head of his
famous free companies, had fought many a hard fight since then),
died leaving an only son behind him. Old King Edward, who had
been battling and fighting as much as his son, now in his old age, had
grown dotingly fond of a wicked hussy, Alice Perrers by name,
that had been maid of honour to the good Queen Philippa. The king
gave to this good-for-nothing creature all the queen's jewels, she had
the giving away of all the places about the court, and behaved in such
a way that the parliament was obliged to stop her extravagance.
A year after, his son, the famous old warrior, King Edward III.,
felt that death was coming upon him; and called his beloved Alice
Perrers to come and console him ere he died. She seeing death on
his face, took the expiring monarch's hand in hers, and pulled his ring
off his finger. The servants pillaged the wardrobes and the hangings
of the bed, and dying Edward, the terror of Frenchmen, lay unheeded
upon his bed, until a priest came by chance into the room, and knelt
down by the king's side, and said a prayer with him for the safety of
his soul, at the end whereof, the priest alone had the power of saying
“Amen.”
Here Miss Tickletoby paused with a very solemn voice, and the
little children retired quite wistfully and silently, and were all particu-
larly good in school the next day.

THE NATURAL HISTORY OF COURTSHIP.
CHAPTER XII.-REs PEcT ING WIDows.
“It may be a weakness, my patient Priscilla, but I confess it ; I
have a passion for widows.”
“For widows " replies my maiden Mentor, rising suddenly in her
chair—“Are they not for the most part designing, sophisticated
Have not their connubial experiences robbed them of that simplicity
which is so charming in women Moreover, are they not (what I
believe to be an unpardonable sin in the estimation of your sex) are
they not generally old f”
“Convict on all counts, I confess. But then, their designs are car-
ried out with such spirit and dexterity—their sophistication so fre-
quently amounts to the art which conceals art, as to seem like the
most ingenuous simplicity; their manners are unembarrassed—
their conversation free from reserve—”
“Perfectly,” interrupts Priscilla, drawing herself up to her full
height.
gTheir caprices are few. They do not often say ‘No’ when they
mean ‘Yes. They are the easiest to please, the least exacting, the
most grateful for any stray attentions which may be vouchsafed to
them. Above all, they have an enchanting habit of meeting one
half-way—nay, of occasionally advancing the first half.”
Show me a more agreeable person than a young widow ! Address
her—she listens smilingly, replies frankly; solicit her to waltz—her
negative or affirmative is so uttered as to convince you she fully
means what she says, and that you need not bother yourself to ask
her twice. There is a cordiality in her manner which immediately
puts you on the footing of friendship, be you ever so great a stranger.
How courteously she would “rather not” accompany you alone to
the opera. But, on the other hand, how winningly she receives your
morning call ; with what charming self-possession does she prevent
all interruption by replying to the announced visitation of a Frank
Kennedy or a Simper that she is not at home. With what pleasing
promptitude does she put you out of your misery at that agony point,
the point of declaration! Unlike the simpering spinster, she does
not waver, or hover about the edge of your hopes to sharpen them
up—to nurture them till full-blown and then scatter them to the
winds. She hath no mama to consult—no time to take for consider-
ation; her negative is irreprievable perdition, her affirmative means
s
º
marriage; but if it have an alloy, it is her careful solicitude that all
the substantial happiness be settled on herself.
Going to the opposite extreme of old widows, we find they are
never courted unless by men in the last stage of destitution. If rich,
they are generally so pestered by their relations, that they are brought
into a state of unendurable disagreeableness, and suddenly get mar-
ried out of spite. Some will, however, stand a very tough courtship,

having at last named the happy day, when it arrived, her legatees
were busily reading her will.
The widow who has received some unpleasant indications that she
is getting passee—that her second, or peradventure third, chance grows
remote—is, I must own, a far less agreeable personage than the young
widow. She becometh curious in cosmetics, and leaveth off caps.
She patronises dentists, and gets mightily particular about the fitting
of her corsages. She sendeth her eldest children to remote schools; and,
if allowed to return for the holidays, they are found to be wonderful
children of their age, for from it a year or two is deducted. In her

in which my reverend friend, George Gingerly, got married, affords
an excellent illustration of this branch of the subject.
Though Gingerly took a double first at Oxford, could read Ovid
and Anacreon in the original as readily as I can divine the thoughts
of the fascinating Florence, by looking into her eyes—yet he had
not the most remote idea of the modus operandi of love-making. He
mever took but one lesson, and that finished him.
It was at a Brighton boarding-house. The “party” consisted of
the invariable complement of superannuated India and naval officers,
male and female idlers, and that eternal old maid, the (very) distant
relative of some lord, who is to be found in every similar establish-
ment along the shores of Great Britain. -
My clerical friend had temporarily absented himself from his
living to improve his health, or, as an intolerable punster amongst
us would have it, had left one cure to effect another. He was a
timid, retiring man, possessing all the gravity of his calling, and con-
siderably more than usually appertains to his age ; which was under
thirty. He had not been a day in the house before his doom was
fixed. Fortune—or, more properly, Mrs. Belsize—marked him for
her own She sat next to him at dinner, and did her utmost to
draw him out. Vain attempt . His replies were monosyllabic.
Nothing daunted, she challenged him in the evening to chess; but
he would be betrayed into no greater loquacity than now and then
saying—“Check.” The day after, she contrived to possess herself of
his arm during a promenade on the pier; on another occasion she
got him tete-à-téte into her carriage for a drive. She would be his
partner at whist whenever he played, and was always outrageously
solicitous about the progress of his convalescence.
Though Mrs. Belsize made herself so intensely agreeable, was
what is called a “fine woman,” (certainly not more than forty,) and
became her age bloomingly ; yet the young clergyman shrunk from
her ordinary civilities, and positively winced at her more glaring atten-
tions. Anybody but so thoroughly persevering, so helplessly middle-
aged a widow, would have despaired. Not so Mrs. Belsize.
On the fatal evening Gingerly was entrapped into a saunter on
the esplanade, Mrs. Belsize was at first unusually taciturn and thought-
ful. At the explosion of each sigh, he imagined a slight pressure on
his arm, now locked in hers. At last the lady observed in a subdued
apologetic tone, “I trust you will forgive me, Mr. Gingerly, but I
cannot help remarking that your conduct has been somewhat
imprudent.”
Gingerly's face indicated the maximum of surprise he was capable
of expressing. He, the quiet, the shrinking, the meek—he, guilty of
an act of imprudence “The woman must be mad P’ was his inward
ejaculation.
“I am sure you will not be offended, my dear sir,” she continued,
“but some acknowledgment is really due from me for the marked,
unmerited, I may add, the almost passionate preference which since
we first met you have been pleased to .”
Gingerly blushed to the roots of his hair. He almost trembled,
but managed to stammer out, “I really am quite unconscious .”
“True, it is the delicacy of your attentions, so happily combined
with extreme fervour, which I am free to confess has made so great
an impression upon me.”
“I can only repeat my entire innocence of "
“Of that I am fully assured: the intercourse we have had—slight as
it has been—convinces me that none but the purest, the most honour-
able motives influence the Reverend Mr. Gingerly. Indeed, so fully do
I appreciate the honour you have conferred upon me, that nothing but
an inadequate fortune,—in short, Mr. Gingerly, I think it right to
tell you that I have barely fifteen hundred a year at my own dis-
posal, To be sure the rectory of Bleakmore-cum-Furze is partly in
my gift, the present incumbent being in his seventy-second year.—
Ah, here we are, at home I declare—how cery swiftly the time has
flown l’”
Without the chance of a reply, Gingerly was left to his fate in the
drawing-room. He retired early to bed, his thoughts turned into
a new channel, and never from that night flowed they out of it, for
before Christmas Mrs. Belsize was Mrs. Gingerly, and her husband
rector of Bleakmore-cum-Furze.
“You astonish me!” exclaims Priscilla, vainly striving to conceal
her indignation. “And could the smallest happiness result from so
indecorous a courtship !”
“All, I believe, that was anticipated. The rector — whose pro-
perty nearly equalled his wife's—never preaches after dinner, but is
exceedingly strict in his attendance at the sea-side throughout the
autumn. In the winter he does duty in person and Mrs. G. is a great
getter up of balls and fancy bazaars for the benefit of her own infant
school and the “ladies society for the distribution of catechisms and
coals during the winter months.’”
SCHOOL OF LEGITIMATE
DRAMA.
THE SAFE-SAILING
HoNou RED PUNCH,
Most likely thou thoughtest I was dead : but it is not so ; for
here I be, further to enlighten man in the dramatic art. I give thee
a scene from a play I am composing, called “The Rival Drysalters,”
which will occur about the middle of that piece. And to show thee
why I call my play of the “safe-sailing school,” I would observe to
thee, that the dialogue is not very easy of apprehension, but doth
abound in such palpable truths as none can contradict; and that the
audience, being highly refreshed, and hearing so much of that for
which they can vouch, will applaud very exceedingly. Hence do l
consider my play safe; for I shall startle none of any unpleasant
revelation, but shall merely propound such doctrines as they will
perfectly know before I shall utter them. And that my play may be
still more safe, thou wilt see that I make that painted variety, which
is called a drop-scene, descend with admirable cunning on what the
frivolous students of stage-plays do call an “effect.”
Yours lovingly,
catching his EYE.

COBALT AND HIS DAUGHTER MAUDLINA.
Cobalt. You went then to the Lord Mayor's show alone :
Maud. I did, my father.
Cobalt. 'Twas not well, my child ;
'Twas not respectable.
Maud. I meant no ill.
Cobalt. Child, I doubt not the spotless purity
That beams from thy young soul. I only fear
The loathsome contact of that motley crowd—
A crowd of vagabonds of low degree,
Of shopmen who ne'er take their freedom up ;
"Checker'd with the swell mob. 'Tis not enough
That we be pure—we only should touch purity;
The knife that's breathed upon is not so bright
As ere the breath hath soil'd it. And the hand
Having touch'd pitch is fouler than before.
Maud. I love thee—thou'rt so respectable
In all thy notions.
Cobalt. Dost thou love thy sire
Yet not alone—thou lovest thine uncle too.
Maud. Ay, but my uncle cannot be my parent.
An uncle and a father are two things;
My uncle was not husband to my mother.
Oh I lives there one within this world who says
A father is not nearer than an uncle :
Cobalt. My darling child, how prettily the truth
Trembles on thy soft lips ' But, most sweet Maud,
Say wouldst thou love me were my fame polluted
By some queer action ? Say, I had ensnared

Of traveller unwary; eased a till
Of all its rich and ponderous contents—
Or, say I wrote the wrong name on a cheque,
Wouldst thou then love me, Maudlin
Maud. Love thee, sire
Ay, hadst thou written fifty thousand names,
On fifty thousand cheques, would that annul
The register in Bishopsgate Within,
That tells me I’m thy child;—would that remove
The obligation of my schooling bills
No, thou mayst forge, pick pockets, rob a till,
If thou'rt my father now, thou'lt be so then.
Cobalt. That truth has never struck me.
Maud. Oh, my father
Though truth is bright, it often never strikes us
Until the veil that hides it is removed.
The moon is bright, but 'tis not visible
When hidden by black clouds;–the sav'ry joint
That forms our Sunday's dinner is not seen
Until the cover 's taken off : and thus
A truth unknown is not a truth perceived.
Cobalt. What wisdom hangs upon thy lips, fair Maud,
Like bees upon the honey-comb
Maud. Thou mockest me ;
And yet I love to see thee smile, my father :
A smile is sure more cheerful than a tear !
Cobalt. Ay, but the tear reflects thy form, my child ;
And therefore is it lovely : while a smile—
A smile, my child—has no reflecting power.
Maud. No, these are nature's subtleties, my father:
One thing reflects, another doth not so.
The silver'd glass and polish’d steel reflect,
But not the plank of wood.

I'll do thy business for thee, Master Cobalt.
Cobalt. Get out, I say.

PROVINCIAL THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
MR. Smith, whose performance of the walking gentlemen at the Pavi-
hon had attracted some attention among play-goers in the East, and won
him a bay leaf, if not a laurel, from the inhabitants of Whitechapel, has
been managing a sharing concern on the confines of Bedfordshire. His
Hamlet is spoken of as a masterly performance, and he has paid more
than usual attention to costume, by playing the part in a gambroon cloak,
over which he once upset an ink bottle. The line referring to the “inky
cloak” of the melancholy Dane is thus beautifully realised.
The four Patagonians, who are well known to most of the patrons of
ratuitous street exhibitions in the Metropolis, are “starring it” at the
nelagh tea-gardens, near Broadstairs. They performed on Saturday
for positively the last time but thirty, previous to their final departure for
Patagonia.
Mrs. Edwards, who slipped down on the stage of the Olympic, where
she had been playing with success as a supernumerary through the whole
of the last season, has been engaged at the Tadcaster Theatre, where she
is announced to open as Lady Macbeth, “being her first appearance since
her late accident.” There is also a paragraph at the top of the bill,
alluding to the impression which she made on the London boards, a state-
ment that is not overdrawn, for the lessee of the Olympic assures us, that
the dent occasioned on the stage by her fall is still perfectly visible. As
she is extremely corpulent, there is no doubt that she will have great
weight in the provinces.
Why is there every reason to suppose that Cain took his name from the town of
Caen in Normandy? Because when he slew Abel he must have been on the road to
Rouen (Ruin).
ROYAL WIT ON THE ROYAL TOUR.
“OUR own correspondent” having assumed the disguise of a
“lubberly loblollyboy” on board the Royal Yacht in its recent pro-
gress to and from Scotland, had an opportunity of overhearing all
that was said by the Queen on the deck of the Sovereign. The
indefatigable penny-a-liner concealed himself in the back yard of
the main top, and, like a spectre in the shrouds, sat listening to every-
thing that escaped the lips of Queen Victoria. We give extracts
from the log which our paragraph-monger—prompted by the love of
filthy lucre from our till—kept during the voyage.
On reaching Leith, the Queen turned round to the cockswain and
asked if it was not the harbour of Leith the squadron was coming to.
Having answered in the affirmative, her Majesty turned to her Royal
Consort, and observed, “Well, Albert we have both been very ill, but
we shall forget it all in the waters of Lethe.” As the Prince did not
immediately see the joke, Gold Stick was desired to point out, which
he did by spelling Leith and Lethe three times over, when his Royal
Highness succeeded in uttering a mild “He, he l’’ which was
responded to from the shrouds by the loud “Ha, ha!” of “our own
correspondent.”
On the return of the Queen from Scotland, her Majesty was being
asked her opinion of her northern subjects, and it was suggested that
they were at least above all suspicion in their devoted loyalty. “I
must say,” remarked Victoria, “that if every other place were in open
insurrection, I think that the people of Edinburgh—while they have
such a Lord Provost and such Bailies as the present—would be the
very last to concur in a rising.”
BETter LATE than NEVER.
The extreme wit of this sally, and its tranchant allusion to the late
case of lie-a-bed, had such an effect on “our own correspondent,” that
he fell in strong convulsions from the first yard of the jib into the
centre of the cockpit.
THE LORD MAYOR ANd the RETURN of the QUEEN.
The Lord Mayor is the Conservator of the Thames—an office which
entitles him either personally or by his officers to beat off the boys when
bathing in frequented parts of the river. The Lord Mayor is also er-
officio the guardian of the geese, and superintendant of the swans; but we
are not aware that he has any further duty to perform, unless it be the
personal superintendence of the cesspools—an office shared with the com-
missioners of sewers, who make an annual pilgrimage along the “ways
and watercourses” which empty themselves into the river. His Lordship,
in right of his being charged with the delicate occupations above alluded
to, wrote to suggest that he should be ready, as Conservator of the
Thames, to attend the Queen on her progress down the river. When her
Majesty ascertained the exact nature of the relation between the Thames
and the Mayor—when she found that the boys, the geese, the sewers, and
the swans were the only matters to which his Lordship in his official
capacity was called upon to attend, a message was sent to him indicating
the propriety of his making himself scarce during the progress of the
squadron in attendance on the Sovereign.
PRISON POLITICS.
AN attempt has been made in certain quarters to give a political com-
plexion to the late horrible case of hair-cutting in Dover Castle, and ques-
tions have been angrily asked as to whose administration appointed the
gaoler. It is strictly maintained by some that the national hair would
have been respected under a Grey Government, while others affirm that
any cabinet, of which Lord Palmerston was a member, would have en-
couraged art at the expense of nature, and thrown those who might be
temporarily confined in prison into the arms of Rowland. ithout
wishing, however, to attribute any peculiar merit to the Tories, we are
bound to state, that the gaoler who cut off the hair of the two comedians
at Dover, must have been in the interest of the Wigs.

ALARM ING PROSPECT .
Thr SPIRIT Mowrth HIM,
To the Editor of “Punch.”
‘SIR,--You are aware, of course, that in the progress of a few cen-
turies the language of a country undergoes a great alteration; that
the Latin of the Augustan age was very different from that of the
time of Tarquin; and no less so from that which prevailed at the fall
of the Roman empire. Also, that the Queen's English is not precisely
what it was in Elizabeth's days; to say nothing of its variation from
what was its condition under the Plantagenets.
I observe, with regret, that our literature is becoming conversa-
tional, and our conversation corrupt. The use of cant phraseology is
daily gaining ground among us, and this evil will speedily infect, if it
has not already infected, the productions of our men of letters. I
fear most for our poetry; because what is vulgarly termed slang is
unfortunately very expressive, and, therefore, peculiarly adapted for
the purposes of those whose aim it is to clothe “thoughts that
breathe” in “words that burn ;” and, besides, it is in many instances
equivalent to terms and forms of speech which have long been recog-
nised among poetical writers as a kind of current coin.
The peril which I anticipate, I have endeavoured to exemplify in
the following
AFFECTING COPY OF VERSES,
(with Nores.)
Gently o'er the meadows prigging, (a)
Joan and Colin took their way,
While each flower the dew was swigging, (b)
In the jocund month of May.
Joan was beauty's plummiest (c) daughter;
Colin youth's most nutty (d) son ;
Many a nob (e) in vain had sought her;
Him full many a spicy (f) one.
She her faithful bosom's jewel
Did unto that young un’ (g) plight;
But, alas ! her gov'nor (h) cruel,
Said as how he'd never fight. (i)
Soon as ere the lark had risen,
They had burst the bonds of suooze, (j,
And her daddle (k) link'd in his'n, (4)
Gone to roam as lovers use.
In a crack (m) the youth and maideu
To u ſlowery bank did come,
Whence the bees cut, (n) honey-laden
Not without inelodious buu.
Down they squatted (o) them together,
“Lovely Joan,” said Colin bold,
“Tell me, on thy davy, (p) whether
Thou dost dearthy Colin hold P”
“Don’t I just 1” (q) with look ecstatic,
Cried the young and ardent maid ;
“Then let's bolt!" (r) in tone emphatic,
Bumptious (s) Colin quickly said.
“Bolt?” she ſalter'd, “from the gov'nor?
Oh! my Colin, that won't pay; (1)
He will ne'er come down, (u) my love, nor
Help us, if we run away.”
“Shall we, then, be disunited?”
Wildly shriek'd the frantic cove; (c)
“Mull'd (w) our happiness 1 and blighted
In the kinchin-bud (r) our love 1
"No, my tulip ! (y) let us rather
Hand in hand the bucket kick; (2)
Thus we'll chouse (1) your cruel father—
Cutting from the world our stick!” (2)
Thus he spoke, and pull'd a knife out,
Sharp of point, of edge full fine;
Pierc'd her heart, and let the life out:
“Now,” he cried, “here's into mine !” (3)
But a hand unseen behind him
Did the fatal blow arrest.
Oh, my eye 1 (4) they seize and bind him:
Gentle Muse, conceal the rest!
In the precincts of the prison,
In his cold crib (5) Colin lies:
Mourn his fate all you who listen;
Draw it mild, and mind your eyes (6)
§
COURTING The MUSE.
NOTES.
(a) “Prigging.” stealing; as yet exclusively applied to petty
larceny. “Stealing” is as well known to be a poetical term, as it is
to be an indictable offence; the Zephyr and the Vesper Hymn, cum
multis aliis, are very prone to this practice.
(b) “Swigging,” drinking copiously—of malt liquor in particular.
“Pearly drops of dew we drink.”—Old SoNg. -
(c) “Plummiest,” the superlative of “plummy,” exquisitely deli-
cious ; an epithet commonly used by young gentlemen in speaking
of a bonne bouche or “tit bit,” as a mince pie, a preserved apricot, or
an oyster patty. The transference of terms expressive of delightful
and poignant savour to female beauty, is common with poets.
“Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath.”—Shakspene.
“Charley loves a pretty girl, as sweet as sugar-candy.”—ANoN.
(d) “Nutty,” proper—in the old English sense of “comely,”
“handsome.” “Six proper youths, and tall.”—Old Song.
(e) “Nob,” a person of consequence; a word very likely to be
patronised, from its combined brevity and significancy.
(f) “Spicy,” very smart and pretty; it has the same recommenda-
tion, and will probably supplant the old favourite, “bonny.” “Busk
ye, busk ye, my bonny, bonny bride.”—HAMILTON.
(9) “Young’un,” youth, young man. “A youth to fortune and to
fame unknown.”—GRAY.
(b) “Gov'nor,” or “guv'nor,” a contraction of “governor,” a
father. It will, no doubt, soon supersede sire, which is at present
the poetical equivalent for the name of the author of one's exist-
ence. See all the poets, passim.
| (i) “Said as how he'd never fight,” the thing was out of the ques-
tion; a metaphorical phrase, though certainly, at present, a vulgar
Ono.
- (j) “Snooze” slumber personified, like “Morpheus,” or “Som-
nus.”
(k) “Daddle.”— Q from Sárruxos, a finger—pars pro toto?–Hand,
the only synonlin for it that we have, except “Paw,” “Mawley,” &c.,
which are decidedly generis ejusdem. -
(l) “His'n,” his own, corresponding to the Latin suus, his own and
nobody else's, so frequently met with in OvID and others. -
(m) “Crack,” a twinkling, an extremely short interval of time,
which was formerly expressed, in general, by a periphrasis; as, “Ere
the Leviathan can swim a league !”—SHAkspear.
(n) “Cut,” sped. A synonym.
(o) “Squatted,” sat. Id.
therefore alluring to the versifier. -
(q) “Dont I just " A question for a strong affirmation, -
yes'ſ indeed I do;" a piece of popular rhetoric, pithy and forcible,
|and consequently almost sure to be adopted—especially by the
pathetic writers.
r) “Bolt,” run away. Syn. - - -
§ “Bumptious,” fearless, bold, and spirited ; a very energetic
expression: such as those rejoice in who would fair “Denham's
strength with Waller's sweetness join.”
(t) “That won't pay,” that plan will never answer. Metaph.
(u) “Come down,” disburse; also rendered in the vernacular by
“fork out,” &c. Id.
(c) “Cove,” Swain. “Alexis shunn'd his fellow strains.”—Paioh.
See also SHENston E passim. .
(p) “Davy,” affidavit, solemn oath. Significant and euphonious,
-
as “oh,

(w) “Mull'd,” equivalent to “wreck'd,” a term of pathos.
Light SPIRITs.
(r) “Kinchin-bud,” infant-bud. Metaph. ; moreover, very tender,
sweet, and touching, as regards the idea.
(y). “My tulip,” a term of endearment. “Fairest flower, all flowers
excelling.”—0de to a Child: Cotton.
(2) “The bucket kick,” pleonasm for die; as, “to breathe life's
latest sigh.”—“To yield the soul,”—“the breath,”—or, ut apud antiq.
“Animam expirare,” seu “efflare,” &c.
(1) “Chouse,” cheat. Syn.
(2) “Cutting . . our stick.” Pleon. ut supra.
(3) “Here's unto mine " . A form of speech analogous to “Have
at thee.”—Shakspeke, and the Dramatists generally.
(4) “Oh, my eye " An interjectional phrase, tantamount to “Oh,
heavens !” “Merciful powers " &c.
(5) “Cold crib,” cold bed. “Go to thy cold bed and warm thee,”
—SHAksper E. -
(6) “Draw it mild,” &c. Metaph. for “Rule your passions, and
beware ſ” -
I doubt not it will be admitted by your judicious readers that I
have substantiated my case. Our monarchical institutions may pre-
serve our native tongue for a time, but if it does not become, at no
very distant period, as strange a medley as that of the American
is at present;-to use the expressive but peculiar idiom of that peo-
ple—“it’s a pity.”
I am, Sir, &c. P.
THE TIMES AND THE HERALD.
On Monday the 12th of September, the Times published a coffee-
house dialogue, which those who read it will not easily forget; and
though it was extremely brief, it may be said that it will be very long
before the Herald recovers the effect of it. The same day, the editors
and contributors of the latter were summoned to a council in Shoe-
lane, and—on the principle of the wooden pavement—began laying
their heads together for the purpose of outdoing the joke which the
Times had indulged in at the expense of the Herald. The result came
out in the paper of the next morning; and we are compelled to say
that we were almost moved to tears at the melancholy instance of
imbecility that met our eye in the columns of one who, though de-
lighting in the title of Herald of the Morn, is certainly not the cock
of the walk of newspaper literature.
By way of improving on the Times, the Herald gave two dialogues;
but the negativeness of wit, though doubled, failed in producing the
usual affirmative, and the two wretched efforts presented to our minds
the semblance of a sandwich without any meat—the two dry pieces
of bread without the savoury and piquant morsel that gives the sub-
stance as well as the relish. When reading the Herald's retort, we
felt that bad had begun ; but we did not conceive that worse could
possibly remain behind, until we came to the second part of the
paragraph.
As the contest is one which is likely to amuse and interest the
public, we give a few specimens of the mode in which this keen en-
counter of the wits of the two journals may possibly be carried on,
should they persevere in it.
From the “Times.”
STREET Dialogue.—A.—“Can you tell me the best mode of com-
municating in print to a person without giving publicity to what I
have to tell ?” B.—“Oh, yes! If you are desirous of keeping it very
quiet, advertise in the Herald.”
From the “Morning Herald.”
Classical. Wit.—A person taking up the Times, and perceiving its
attempt to be severe at the expense of a contemporary, exclaimed
tºo tempora!” when a bystander pungently added, “You cannot say
“O mores!” for the Times' people have forgotten their manners.”
From the “Times.”
A correspondent has addressed us on the subject of Sleep-at-Will,
and wishes us to tell him if there is anything in it. We refer him to
the permanently-enlarged sheets of the Morning Herald.
From the “ Herald.”
A person having read a leader in the Times, was informed, that
some years ago, different articles were written; and that, though the
paper supported the Reform Bill, it now opposed the people's
Charter. Upon this, the person—who happened to be an inveterate
wag—could not refrain from having his joke, and remarked that the
Times were sadly changed; when some one close facetiously added—
“Yes; you may well say Tempora mutantur.”
From the “Times.”
A correspondent wishes to know whether it is true that arms are
really found at the Herald office. We have no doubt that arms, legs,
hands, or, indeed, anything but heads, may be met with in the place
alluded to.
From the “Herald.”
An individual of our acquaintance, happening to see the Times, and
being rather of a sarcastic turn of mind, observed that the Times were
out of joint; and then, in allusion to its being called the leading jour-
mal, satirically remarked, “We must obey the Times,” as Othello said,
on taking leave of Desdemona.
From the “Times.”
CoNs1st ENcy of The PREss.-The Herald's indignation against
furious driving is by no means assumed, but it acts up to the spirit of
its own views by never receiving any express that has travelled a
the rate of more than four miles an hour.
From the “Herald.”
Dialogue IN A NEws PAPER-shop.—“Have you got a Morning
Herald left “No ;” but we have a Times of yesterday; for we have
generally (since the permanent enlargement of the Herald) got lots
of Times’ on hand.”
We think that the above specimens will be sufficient to illustrate
the style and spirit of the two journals in their passage of arms, in
which it must be allowed that the Times gets by far the best of it.
The weapons of the Herald, it is true, are heavy enough ; but the
combatant of Shoe-lane seems to use the handle of a battle-axe, from
which the cutting portion has been removed, leaving nothing but the
wood, and presenting an utter absence of sharpness.
COURT CIRCULAR.
It appears that Prince Albert, during several hours sport in the forest,
killed “one” buck; but deference to the rank of the royal sportsman has
given vigour and playfulness to the imagination of the penny-a-liners, who
add that though “one buck only was killed, several are supposed to have
been wounded.”
illuminAtrid Ms.
We are quite sure that, if the bucks had been apprised of the Prince's
visit, mere curiosity, to say nothing of politeness—would have drawn
them in great numbers within the reach of his gun, and we can only
regret that the authorities did not issue a proclamation to the deer,
for which the celebrated address to the ducks, beginning with the
well known line, “Dilly, dilly, dilly, dilly, come and be killed,” would have
furnished a model and a precedent.
It is somewhat curious that the Scotch should be remarkable for a
national antipathy to “unmentionables,” when the climate is one which
braces all who live in it. |

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS,
(in the PREvailing style).
We had not intended giving any more answers; but two or three of
our friends have been so very obliging, that we must depart from our
general rule for once, and notice them as follows:–
Communications are at our publisher's for several of our correspondents,
in the shape of their own articles. We recommend them to certain of the
monthly periodicals, as they hardly come up to our standard.
Although the insertion of the following acrostic may lay us open to the
charge of vanity, we shall nevertheless, from a strong sense of its merit,
give it a place :-

Covered the manner of reading it, which is to begin at the end and go
backwards to the beginning.
ROYAL STUDIES.
PRINCE ALBERT has, it is well known, been devoting considerable time
and attention to the study of English history, under the superintendence;
of an accomplished master. A little while ago the royal student was read-
ing the reign of Charles the First, when it was suggested by the tutor that
the monarch failed in his contest with the republican party chiefly through
his own want of intellectual qualities. “I perceive your meaning,” said
Prince Albert; “Charles played a very hazardous game: he ran a race
with Croinwell, and at last he lost by a head.”
REPORTs from Dusseldorf state that the King of Hanover is “ going on
well:". If this be the case, his Hanoverian Majesty must have been lately
subjected to alteratives, the beneficial effects of which his subjects will no
doubt be glad to recognise.
THE ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY.
-
study FROM the Antique.
This excellent society met last week on the Goodwin Sands, and were
occupied for several hours in searching for the remains of the castle of
the Earl of Goodwin. Having at length relinquished the effort as vain,
the members formed themselves into a committee to sit twice a week
on the sands, for the purpose of investigating the fact whether there even
was a land communication between France and England. It was, sug.
gested, with much ingenuity, that classical authority was strongly in
favour of the supposition, for the modern word Calais is evidently a cor-
ruption of the old Latin word Callis, a path ; and it is, therefore, probable
that there was a Roman path or pavement from the French coast to Dover.
Having come to this conclusion it was observed that the tide was rising,
and the sands beginning to assume a state of fluidity, the meeting was at
once dissolved.
The DOWER CROPPING CASE.
It is jº, hard upon one of the gentlemen who were subjectet
to the scissors at Dover, that he is in the habit of playing rakish young
men, and he justly complains that after his recent frightful loss of haii
he cannot embody “a hairum scareum character.”
THE gaoler at Dover Castle is, we understand, to be allowed an op
portunity of explaining the circumstances under which he caused the hail
to be cut from the heads of the two comedians. Though there is no
reason whatever to distrust the account of the affair given by these two
gentlemen, it must be admitted that theirs professes to be nothing more
than a bald statement. There must, at all events, be some change effected
in a system, which treats the convicted culprit and the party waiting for
bail with equal severity, and makes not even a hair's difference betweer
the guilty and the innocent.
ROYAL NICETY.
(Communicated by our “Colonel.”)
WE understand that the Queen was prevailed upon to taste a piece of
oat-cake during her sojourn in Scotland. On being asked her opinion of
it, Her Majesty replied, that the practice of eating oats would better suit
the inhabitants of Oataheite / / /

Wear the same Taglioni coat.

Of novelty and change.

PUNCHPS LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER X.-EVERY MAN HIS OWN APPRAISER.-leg END OF THE
RIGHT LeG.
Youn last letter, my dear son, annoyed, oppressed me. What
you wish you had been born an Esquimaux, a Chippewaw, a Hottentot,
rather than a member of the most civilised, most generous nation (as
every people modestly say of themselves) on the face of the earth
Ungrateful boy I is this the return you make me for the very hand-
some present of your existence,—is this your gratitude for being called
out of nothing to become an eating, drinking, tax-paying animal
Despondency, my child, is the slow suicide of the mind. Heaven
knows what I have suffered at the hands of the world !—how, with
my heart bleeding into my very shoes, I have still chirped and
crowed roo-tooit-tooit, despising while I laughed with and chattered to
the reeking rascals, niggard of their pence, who still thronged and
gaped about me !
“Alas, ’tis true, I have gone here and there,
And made myself a motley to the view,
Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
Made old offences of affections new : ''
Nevertheless, if now and then my heart has been a little slack, I
have braced it up again with my drum, and looking upon life at the
best to be composed of just so many pleasurable sensations, I have
enjoyed myself as often as I could, which I have thought the very
wisest way of showing my gratitude for my existence. When I
could not obtain large pleasures, I put together as many small ones
as possible. Small pleasures, depend upon it, lie about us thick as
daisies; and for that very reason are neglected, trodden under foot,
instead of being worn in our button-holes. We can't afford to buy
moss-roses at Christmas, or camellias at any time; and so, all the
year round we couple buttercups with vulgarity; and the lovely,
odorous things that grow in the hedge-side, we let wither where they
grow, for no other reason than that the king's highway is not a royal
garden.
At the same time, my dear boy, I would not have you copy the
contentment of your father. Contentment is very well in a pastoral;
and I have seen something which called itself contentment, sitting
smugly at a small-coal fire, enjoying its crust and half-a-pint of beer
in a tin mug on the hob, only because it would not stir itself to get
the port and olives, that with very little exertion were within its
reach. Though I know this to be pusillanimity, and not content-
ment, nevertheless, my dear child, I cannot altogether acquit myself
of it. Be warned by your sire. I might, with my genius, have trod
the boards of a stage,_have had my name upon the walls, in type
that blacking-makers should have envied; I might have danced
quadrilles in Cavendish-square on my off-nights, and been trundled
about the town in my own air-cushioned carriage; for I have all the
qualifications in the highest degree which lead to such a golden
result ; of this I am assured by their success when once poorly
and extravagantly copied by another: but no, I was doomed to be a
street vagabond, and came into the world with a base taste for mud
in my infant mouth, and an ear throbbing for drum and pandeans,
Hence, I have—when doing my best—been scoffed at, and abused by
fish-wives, when with the sagacious application of the same powers,
I might have been pelted by heiresses with bouquets from the boxes!
My child, know not diffidence: it is an acquaintance that hourly
picks your pocket—that makes you hob-and-nob with plush breeches,
when otherwise, you might jostle it with court ruffles. Receive this for
an axiom : nineteen times out of twenty the world takes a man at his
own valuation. A philosopher—I forget his name—has called the
human soul, on its first manifestation in this world, thickly veiled as
it is in baby-flesh—a blank sheet of paper. Now I, my son, call every
full-grown man at his outset in life, a piece, not of blank, but of bank
paper; in fact, a note, in all things perfect save that the amount is
not written in. It is for the man himself to put down how many
pounds it shall pass for ; to snatch an eagle-quill, and, with a brow
of bronze and eye of brass, to write down
& out Ghousano
or else, with shaking hand and lips of indigo, to scratch a miserable,
pauper-stricken, squalid—
£ 6me
It is, I say, for the man himself to give value to his own moral paper ;
and though, I grant, now and then, the prying and ill-natured may
hold up the article to the light to search for the true water-mark, the
owner of the note has only to swagger and put the face of a Caesar on
the transaction, to silence every scruple.
As an instance, my dear boy, of what perseverance will do—of
what an inexorable advocacy of merit (or fancied merit, for that is the
thing) will do, for the professor, I will give you a short story, drawn
from a Dutch annalist of the sixteenth century.
Serene and balmy was the 9th of June morning, 1549, when three
men dressed as heralds, and superbly mounted on pie-bald horses,
appeared in the streets of Utrecht. Immediately behind them,
mounted on a mule richly caparisoned, rode a man, or rather a
human bundle—a hunchback, with his right leg less than a goose's
over-roasted drumstick; the leg was moreover bowed like a pot-hook;
and, as at first was thought, that its deformity might be fully seen,
was without hose or shoe; in plain words—it was a naked leg. The
dwarf was followed by six horsemen handsomely arrayed, and
strongly mounted.
The procession halted before the burgomaster's door, when the
heralds, putting their trumpets to their lips, blew so loud a blast that
every man's money danced in his pocket. The crowd with gaping
mouths and ears awaited the proclamation of the herald, who thus
unburthened himself:
“Let it be known to all corners of the creation, that our most noble,
most puissant master, now present, the right valorous and worthy
Vandenhoppenlimpen, has the most perfect right leg of all the sons
of earth ! In token whereof, he now exhibiteth the limb ; whereat, let
all men shout and admire 1"
On the instant, the dwarf cocked up his withered stump, self-com-
placently laying his hand upon his heart; and at the same moment
the crowd screamed and roared, and abused and reviled the dwarf,
whilst some market-women discharged ancient eggs and withered
apples at him, and the procession, followed by the roaring populace,
made their way back to their hostelry.
The next morning, at the same place and like hour, the same pro-
clamation was made. Again the undaunted dwarf showed his limb,
and again he was chased and pelted.
And every day for six months, the unwearied heralds proclaimed
the surpassing beauty of Vandenhoppenlimpen's right leg, and every
day the leg was exhibited. And after a time, every day the uproar
of the mob decreased ; and the leg was considered with new and
growing deference. -
“After all, we must have been mistaken—there surely is something
in the leg,” said one contemplative burgher.
“I have some time thought so,” answered another.
“”Tisn't likely,” said a third, “that the man would stand so to the
excellence of his leg, unless there were something in it not to be seen
at once.”
“It is my faith,” said the burgomaster's grandmother—“a faith
I'll die in, for I have heard the sweet man himself say as much a
hundred-and-fifty times, that all other right legs are clumsy and ill-

shaped, and that Vandenhoppenlimpen's leg is the only leg on the
earth made as a leg should be.”
In a short season, this faith became the creed of the mob ; and, oh,
how the neighbouring cities, towns, and villages emptied themselves
into Utrecht, to gaze and marvel at Vandenhoppenlimpen's leg
When he died, a model of the limb was taken, and, cast in virgin
gold, is now used as a tobacco-stopper on state occasions, at the
Stadt-house of Utrecht.
My child, there are at this moment many Vandenhoppenlimpens
eating bread very thickly buttered, from having stoutly championed
the surpassing merits of their bowed and bucked right leg.
OUR WANTS.–No. 1.
WHAT a tremendous panorama of life is the advertising sheet of
the Times 1–what food for “sweet and bitter melancholy 1"–what
polished, daily lying—what “respectable" frauds—what allowable
felonies of trade—what misery—what devotion—what brief stories,
written in the blood of breaking hearts, in all the agony of hopeless
tears How often, in a dozen lines, do we come at the history of a
miserable life . How often do we in an advertisement, even for the
place of governess, see a household wreck —see a father stricken by
death or undeserved misfortune, and the young gentle creature, who
was to him as the light of his eyes, standing in the highways of the
world, and tremblingly offering the accomplishments that once shed
a charm and grace about her own dear hearth, for decent board,
lodging, and a pittance that can leave nothing for her old age—if her
heart do not happily break ere grey hairs come—but the union work-
house and a pauper's grave.
Believe it, reader, that the romance of life—the grand struggles that
dignify human nature past the dignity of the Caesars—are to be seen
in the advertising columns of a newspaper. For our own part, we
can suck food for reflection from them as “a weasel sucks eggs.” We
can sometimes fasten upon an advertisement, and, from its brief yet
touching significance, piece out the previous destiny of the adver-
tiser. As for fictitious woe—for the well-constructed miseries of a
novelist—they are poor and bungling, compared to the perfect inci-
dents of wretchedness and suffering indicated in many an advertise-
ment. The thoughtful eye, pursuing what to the idle glance may
seem a barren notice, may gush into tears at the frequent misery of
some twenty lines. Such advertisements are social tragedies, written
in humanity's short-hand; their true meaning hidden to the illiterate
in human emotion and human suffering, but revealing terrible griefs,
heart-rending miseries to the soul of sympathy.
Why, looking upon an advertisement page, we can immediately
surround ourselves with a crowd of human beings. We are in the
very throng of men—behold them shuffling, hear them lying—see five
hundred faces sharpened by interest—not the faces of men, but of
foxes, wolves : and then we can behold the meek, the gentle looks
of unprotected goodness, and hear that low, sweet voice of humanity,
which makes the harmony of angels.
We purpose, then, at intervals, to chat with the reader upon such
advertisements as may appear to us to develop, in a peculiar manner,
the character or history of the advertiser. We shall range through
all the columns. We will seize upon all, from the man-eating money-
lender—a cannibal who frequently lurks in print to catch and eat
young baby men with the bait of “money advanced ”—to the humble
folks who are about to “sell their mangle”—(we really saw such
notification in the Times of the 17th inst.)—and proceed in quest of
better fortune to America. It is a notion with us. that in this series
of papers (and they shall have a corresponding brevity with their
subject matter) we can incidentally illustrate some part of the social
history of England. If we do not, the fault is in us, and not in our
theme.
Our opening example is, certainly, of a mingled yarn. It appeared
in the Times of the 17th inst., and runs as follows:–
44 To LADIES, CLERGYMEN, SOLICITORS, AUTHORS, and
PUBLISHERS.-A Lady, arrived from Paris on the 15th instant, wishes to
meet with a SITUATION, either to supply the place of daughter to a bereaved
mother, as companion to a lady, to superintend with economy the domestic arrange-
ments of a widower, paying responsible attention to the intellectual, moral, and
religious development of his children; to copy for solicitors, with precision, prompt-
ness, and secresy; to be an amanuensis to any author of respectability, or to write
any given subject for publishers per sheet. High references offered by the adver-
tiser. Application, post paid, to A. Z., London. Letters, with real signature and
address (no others attended to), appointing an hour of interview, or, if distant,
stating_the required qualifications, and authors and publishers the subjects of
their MSS., will meet with immediate attention and decision.”
The energy of purpose is altogether equal with the versatility of
power. Mark the fall. She can be a “daughter,” or she can “copy
for solicitors " She can, by her facile goodness, stanch the new
wound in a mother's heart, or she can, “with precision,” write legal
wickedness upon parchment Stop : the lawyer's office is only the
half-way house, not the terminus to her abilities. She can write on
“any given subject for publishers, per sheet !” God help her I
And then, mark the sweet humility. She who can write upon
any subject—she to copy the writings of others . She, it may be, a
Madame DE STAEL, to pen the dictated inanities of a Mrs. ANYBoDY
Again, she is great at the “domestic arrangements of a widower,”
and is equally potent in “religious development.” What a range of
intellect —from the boiling of a potato, to the Athanasian Creed I
This advertisement has upon it the face of impudence; yet who
shall say it is not the effort of some good, bustling, eccentric soul, who
thinks all things equally easy to a willing mind Who shall say she
is not—in this seeming absurdity—endeavouring to vindicate some of
the noblest charities of life Some of the pittance to be obtained
either as an apologetic daughter or copyist of law moralities may be
destined to the support of father, mother, infant brother or sister,
We confess there is a wholesale business-air about the offer that may
raise a smile; yet—such puppets are we of circumstance—great may
be the beautiful humanity-adoring “A. Z."
To “A. Z.” we subjoin a brief history, developing a fine piece of
rascality. In the Times of the 17th instant appeared the following:—
4 º' Flºy POUNDS LOST, on Tuesday or Wednesday last, consisting
of two 610 and six set Bank of England notes. Whoever will bring them to
Mr. , Lincoln’s-inn-fields, shall receive TEN POUNDS REWARD.
The person who has lost the money will be reduced to the greatest distress if it be not
restored, as the money is trust money. The notes are stopped at the Bank.”
Well, this advertisement is answered by the fortunate vagabond
who finds the money: for on the 19th instant appears the following:—
“TO D. G.-£25.-Your Letter has been received, and is agreed to:
but under the circumstances stated, it is earnestly hoped that 6:15 or even 420
will be accepted. The following are some of the numbers of the notes:–94,269,
94,270,94,271, 94,272, and all of them are known and payment stoppcd. Communicate
as before, Mr. , Lincoln’s-inn-fields.”
Thus the party who, if it could be proved against him that he found
the mouey, and, knowing the loser, refused to restore it, would be in-
dictable, offers to restore half; and that, we doubt not, under the
lurking fear that the notes may be traced.
“D. G.” may, for all this, be a most “respectable” man. He may
simply act according to his own conventional code of morality: he
found the money, and the money is his How many “D. G.'s" are
to be met with, and that in “worshipful society l’

PETER WAGSTAFF IN SCOTLAND.
In the good old times, kings and queens had their state fools: in
these still better days they have their state philosophers. Hence, be
it known, Mr. Punch, that I, Peter Wagstaff, of Dandelion Cottage,
Camberwell, in the county of Surrey, am self-appointed philosopher to
her Majesty Queen Victoria; by virtue of my office have travelled
with her to Scotland, and am only an hour since returned to this my
humble abode, with a hole in either shoe, and a bottle of smuggled
whiskey in either pocket. What glories have I seen what shoutings
have I heard . But I will be brief—sententious as my elder brother
Seneca. -
First, for the deer-stalking : what could be a more animating, or—
as a kindred philosopher of the penny-a-line academy observed—a
more “sublime sight” than to behold Prince Albert bravely plaided,
and fearlessly firing away at the “frightened roes,” driven to the very
muzzle of his deadly fowling-piece by loyal Highlanders : And then,
at “an elevation of about three hundred feet above the Tay,” to bring
down a capercalzie, “fortunately only slightly injured in the wing ſ”
How much more fortunate if not hit at all ! Yet, no ; for the caper-
calzie (poor devil () is “to be kept alive at Windsor Castle or Buck-
ingham Palace " The Prince's sport was, in all, 16 roes, 2 black-
cocks and three black hens, 3 brace of muir-fowl, 2 brace of par-
tridges, and 13 hares, with 1 capercalzie taken prisoner . The bodies
of the dead were tastefully arranged—or rather “laid out"—upon the
lawn, that the Queen might smile at the prowess of her husband
Prince Albert, having received the freedom of the city, has proved,
that if Chartism prevail, he can at any time become a distinguished
member of the poulterers' company.
The Caledonian Mercury says, “There is a prospect of no long ab-
sence of the royal pair; and perhaps, if all tales be true, of the form-
ation of a more permanent tie with Scotland—at least, in one sense.”
This must be “the Albert tie,” no doubt.
When Prince Albert embarked for England, “he was dressed in a
black frock-coat, and wore a black hat, which, from his continuous conde-
scension in returning bows for the cheers, he removed entirely from his
head. I think his Royal Highness might have compromised the mat-
ter by wearing his hat a-cock: “entirely from his head” is a little
too much.
I have read in the Glasgow Chronicle that the Queen has promised to
use her influence to put us all into tartan in the approaching winter.
Sir Robert Peel will make his first appearance in the House of Com-
mons in a kilt; from which circumstance, certain politicians predict
the speedy approach of short Parliaments.
Another startling event has been duly chronicled. When on board
the Trident, her Majesty “asked Prince Albert the hour, and his
Royal Highness, looking at his watch, informed her.” This is another
sign of the Prince's intelligence ; proving, in common phrase, that
Albert knows what's o'clock.
I had jotted down many other notes, but my neighbour Whistleton,
the breeches-maker, has stepped in ; so I must waive my philosophy,
and—for the present—confine myself to whiskey.
Here, Betty—a corkscrew and tumblers.

ETIQUETTE.
WHEN Prince Albert was in Scotland his Royal Highness was inquiring
the height of some of the different mountains, and he was informed by
the Equerry that Ben Lomond held his head particularly high, and
often wore a cap of snow. “Benjamin Who, did you say i" was the
Prince's reply. “Ben Lomond,” answered the Equerry.

“Oh, Benjamin Lomond,” mildly responded his Royal Highness, laying
a slight stress by way of rebuke to the Equerry on the word “Benjamin.”

THE PRICE OF BREAD.
Twists have taken a turn ; and cottages have come down in some
E. owing to the fall of bricks, which continue to give way rapidly. A
aker near one of the bridges has not had a roll over, which is to be
accounted for, by his having come down in regular steps to a level with
the lower class of consumers. Plaster of Paris is in some demand, and
there have been some mysterious transactions in sawdust by the baker
who liberally deals with the workhouse.
THE NATURAL HISTORY OF COURTSHIP.
CHAPTER x III.-on cou Rt in G BY ADV ERTISE MENT.
“TEA or coffee this morning 1" inquires the solicitous Priscilla.
“Neither, just now : as I am reading the Morning Post I imbibe
the necessary inspiration from milk and water. You can order strong
coffee with the Times.”
The elderly gentlewoman took up her own peculiar print, the
Herald. While placidly perusing its pages, her equanimity was sud-
denly disturbed : that calm countenance slowly wound itself up into
an expression of contempt; that mild grey eye flashed forth a beam
of indignation; that rigid frame was agitated like unto the seething
and boiling of the urn upon the table. In Iny alarm at so unusual an
"ebullition I inquired what was the matter, and looked for the Preston
salts.
“I blush for my sex 1" exclaimed the disturbed damsel. “Miss
Robinson really possesses no principle of honour—Let me read you
this paragraph :—
“‘It is whispered in the fashionable circles that a certain young
Viscount, lately returned from his travels, is about to lead to the
hymeneal altar the lovely and accomplished Miss R. The match. it
is rumoured, will be purely one of affection; for the lady was on the
eve of marriage to a certain rich commoner well known in the
musical circles: the fascinating fiancée having herself broken off the
negotiation to favour the suit of the handsome Viscount L–.”
“Pray do not allow a mere matrimonial adrertisement (for it is nothing
more) to ruffle you,” I said, soothingly; “the truth is, Lord Lispen
would be a better match for Miss Robinson than Pleinpurse—and
you must not be hard upon the coquette, and Mrs. Couple, the chape-
ron, for exercising their vocation by publishing the paragraph.”
“They publish it !”
“Even so : its intention is to apprise Lispen that Rose's hand is, if
he pleases, within his grasp. The whole thing will be contradicted
to-morrow by the parties themselves—but what of that ? the end will
have been answered : Lispen's connubial pulse will have been felt,
his symptoms developed.”
“But are all the similar announcements one daily sees, mere matri-
monial advertisements f"
“Nearly so. They are called, in political parlance, ‘feelers’—they
suggest to the parties intended to be trapped what perhaps would
otherwise have never entered their brains; and thus it is a common
occurrence for the torch of Hymen to be lighted by newspaper para-
graphs.” -
Not only these, but other announcements of a less suspicious ap-
pearance, are rank advertisements for connubial bliss. When you
see it stated that at Lady So-and-so's forthcoming ball the beautiful
Miss —— is to come out, the information is addressed to all eligible
bachelors—just as the possessor of a valuable picture invites the in-
spection of connoisseurs, that whoever can afford the price may take it
off his hands. Widowers who advertise for housekeepers “with a
small independence, as no salary will be given,” hope the answerers
may be comely. Widows, per contra, “wishing to superintend the
domestic arrangements of a Widower,” look as anxiously for the re-
plies as a bride for the coming of the bridegroom. Small annuitants,
who insert amongst newspaper “Wants” a desire for “board and
lodging, in a family where there is cheerful society,” pray that the
required cheerfulness may be contributed by some marriage-seeker
in good circumstances. This list might be multiplied—but those
courageous advertisers who boldly head their literary wife-traps
“Matrimony,” deserve speedy attention.
The columns of the Sunday Times, and now and then of the Herald,
may be considered as refuges for the destitute—par exemple:-when
a man has laid his “hand, heart, and fortune” at the feet of every
woman of his acquaintance, and—to speak metaphorically—the foot of
each fair hath been used to kick him out of all hope, he seeks his
revenge in the second column of the Sunday Times, and advertises for
rivals to all who have spurned him —when a spendthrift has outrun
his last sovereign in a race after pleasure, and is finally forced into
WoL. III.- 1842.

‘the quiet happiness of the wedded state” as the means of beginning
a new career of dissipation.
To this pass, I am sorry to say, my quondam friend Kennedy (for
of course all his acquaintance have cut him now he is “done up,”
and I don't like to be singular), has at length come. All went on
prosperously enough with Miss Boulder, till she set her lawyers to
work to look into the proposer's property. Their return being like
that of a useless writ of fifa–" nulla bona,” Kennedy got bowed
out one fine morning without the smallest remorse or mitigation of
the poetess's irony—your Bas-bleus who so frequently assert the des-
picability of the “world's gauds” being always scrupulously particular
about money matters.
A matrimonial advertisement, therefore, issuing from the King's
Bench and the fertile brain of a designer thereof, hight Frank
Kennedy, was recently published in the Herald. The answers were
numerous, and the advertiser is now pendulating between the Court
for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors, and two thousand a-year with a
grocer's widow old enough to be his grandmother.
A glance at matrimonial advertisements in the past tense—un-
der the head “married”—affords the opportunity of mentioning that
Priscilla has just read to me an announcement of the union of Pel-
ham Plummer, of her Majesty's Treasury, Esquire, to Miss Maria
Murray, at St. George's, Hanover Square, by the Very Reverend the
(rural) Dean of Chitterling's, fourth cousin to the happy bridegroom.
In a corner of another paper I perceive, in very small print, that
poor Rose Robinson's coquetry has received its death-blow. She
has, it seems, lost not only the rich Viscount, but the richer com-
moner, and is obliged to put up with Simper after all. They were
married last Thursday at St. Jude's, Brighton.
The boxes of my departing Priscilla are in the hall, the carriage is
at the door, my groom is handing the post-boy a parting dram, the
housemaid is weeping in the arms of my visitor's femme de chambre.
The keys of office tremble in the hands of my old housekeeper as she
receives them from her beloved usurper. A moisture rises to my
own eyes as my friend, counsellor, and guide in the art of courtship,
takes my hand to mount the steps of her pilentum. With graceful
dignity she orders her maid into the rumble, and waves me a cour-
teous adieu. The wheels revolve their gritty way along the avenue;
the sounds gradually fade in the distance—and I am alone
Yes, lovely readers, in me you may now behold a lone, forlorn,
solitary bachelor—reduced to the last extremity of unate despair.
Look, therefore, with an eye of pity into the journals I have already
mentioned, and you will probably soon see an advertisement worded
somewhat after the following fashion :-
MAt RIMony.—A gentleman not very considerably over thirty, who
has lately withdrawn himself from society to execute an important
work on an abstruse social science is forced into this medium of seek-
ing the hand of some beautiful and accomplished young lady to whom
fortune is no object, and who may have her own (should it be con-
|siderable), settled on herself. Provided she have no taste for flirting
can sing and play tolerably, is able to waltz in the style of the
Germans, becomes her age at six-and-twenty (no one a day older
need apply), and is willing to sacrifice her wishes and caprices to the
whims of the advertiser—she may depend upon the strictest secrecy,
an immediate interview, a snug home and a not ill-looking husband,
by applying to B. B., Esq., Punch-office. N.B.-A widow of twenty-
seven would not be objected to. The most scrupulous honour may
be relied on, the advertiser's real, sole, and sincere intention being
the rND or courtship.
MISS TICKLETOBY'S LECTURES ON
ENGLISH HISTORY.
EDWARD III.
THE reign of the third Edward has always been considered a glo-
rious period of our annals—the fact is, he beat the French soundly,
and it is always a comfort to read of these absurd vapouring vainglo-
rious Frenchmen obtaining a beating—and he has had for a historian
of his battles one John Froissart, a very bad clergyman, as I make
no doubt, but a writer so exceedingly lively and pleasant, that the
-scenes of the war are made to pass before the reader as if he saw
them. No-not as if he saw them in reality by the way, but as if
he beheld them well acted in a theatre, the principal characters
represented by Mr. Charles Kean, and other splendid stars of the
sta ºre.
º there is nothing but fighting in the works of the Reverend John
Froissart—nothing but fighting and killing : yet all passes with such
brilliancy, splendour, and good humour, that you can’t fancy for the
world that anybody is hurt; and though the warriors of whom he
speaks are sometimes wounded, it really seems as if they liked it. It
is—“Fair Sir, shall we for the honour of our ladies, or the love of the
blessed virgin of heaven, cut each other's heads off?” “I am unworthy
to have the honour of running through the body such a flower of
chivalry as you,” replies the other, and herewith smiling sweetly on
each other, gaudy with plumes, and gold, and blazing coats of
armour, bestriding prancing war-horses, covered also with gay
housings, and bright steel, at it the two gentlemen go, with lances
in rest, shouting their war-cries gaily. “A Manny a Manny 1 our
Lady for Alençon,” says one or the other:-‘For the love of the saints
parry me that cut, Sir,” says Sir Walter Manny, delivering it
gracefully with his heavy battle-sword, “Par le Sambleu, beau
Sire, voilà un beau coup d'espée,” says the constable to the other,
politely, who has just split his nose in two, or carried off his left
whisker and cheek:—and the common people go to work just as gen-
teelly;-whizz! how the bow-strings thrum, as the English archers,
crying “St. George for England,” send their arrows forth !

for a moment or two, Jane of Montfort, dressed in armour, and
holding up my son in my arms, calling upon my faithful nobles of
Bretagne to defend me and him.
(Here Miss Tickletoby, seizing playfully hold of Master Timson,
lifted him gaily in one of her arms, and stood for a moment in a
heroic attitude; but the children, never having before heard of Jane
of Montfort or her history, were quite frightened, and fancied their
venerable instructress mad, while Master Timson, who believed he
had been elevated for the purpose of being flogged, set up a roar
which caused the worthy lady to put him quickly down again.)
But to speak of King Edward III. The first act of his reign may
be said to have been the seizing of one Mortimer, the Queen's lover,
whom he caused to be hanged, and of her Majesty, whom he placed
in a castle, where she lived for the last seven-and-twenty years of
her life, with a handsome allowance made to her by her son.
The chief of his time hereafter was filled up with wars—those wars
which are so pleasant to read of in Froissart, before mentioned, but
which I need not tell any little child here who ever by chance has
had a black eye or a whipping, are by no means pleasant in reality.
When we read that the King's son, the Black Prince, burned down
no less than 500 towns and villages in the south of France, laying the
country waste round about them, and driving the population Heaven
knows where, you may fancy what the character of these wars must
have been, and that if they were good fun to the knights and soldiers |
they were by no means so pleasant to the people.
By such exploits, however, the reign of Edward is to be noted.
Robert Bruce being dead, and his son a child, Edward fell on the
Scots, slaughtered forty thousand of them at Halidon Hill, and aided
the younger Baliol, who in return promised the submission of him-
self and kingdom to England, to take a temporary possession of the
throne. The Scotch, however, soon rose against Baliol ; and Edward
Bruce got back his crown—such as it was.
Then our Lord Sir Edward took a fancy to France, and, upon a
most preposterous claim advanced by him, assumed the French arms,
called himself king of that country, and prepared to take possession
of the same. The first thing he did, to this end, was to obtain a
glorious victory over the French navy, taking no less than two
hundred and forty of their ships, and killing I don't know how many
thousands of their men. I don’t know if the French wore “wooden
shoes” in those days, but the English hated them for that or some
other equally good cause ; and the Parliaments for ever granted the
King money to carry on the war in assertion of his just rights.
Just rights, forsooth —a private man putting forward such claims to
another's purse, and claiming his just rights with a pistol at your
head, would be hanged for his pains. Bishops and priests said prayers
for King Edward, and judges and lawyers wrote long lying docu-
ments in support of his cause.
In spite of the hundreds of thousands of pounds which his subjects
gave him, and the hundreds of thousands of men he brought into the
field against the King of France, Edward for some time made very
little way, and did not overcome the French King's armies—for the
very good reason, that the latter would never meet him. And it is a
singular thing, that when the two armies did meet, and the English
obtained those two victories about which we have been bragging for
near five hundred years, we did not fight until we were forced, and
because we could not help it.
Burning, robbing, ravaging Edward's
troops, had arrived at the gates of Paris, not with the hope of con-
quering the country, but of plundering it simply; and were making
the best of their way home again from the pursuit of an immense
French army which was pressing them very hard, when Edward, ==
finding he could not escape without a fight, took a desperate stand
and the best ground he could find on the famous hill of Cressy.
Here, sheltered amidst the vines, the English archers and chivalry
took their posts; and the blundering French, as absurdly vain and
supercilious in those days as they are at this moment, thinking to
make easy work of ces coquins d'Anglais, charged the hill and the vine-
yards—not the English, who were behind them, and whose arrows
slaughtered them without pity.
When the huge mass of the French army was thrown into disorder
by these arrows, the English riders issued out and plunged among
them, murdering at their ease; and the result was a glorious triumph
to the British arms. King Edward's son, a lad of fourteen, distin-
guished himself in the fight, holding his ground bravely against the
only respectable attack which the French seem to have made in the
course of the day. And ever since that day, the Princes of Wales, as
you know, have had for a crest that of an old King of Bohe-
mia (the blind old fool!) who could not see the English, but bade his
squires lead him towards them, so that he might exchange a few coups
de lance with them. So the squires laced their bridles into his, made
their attack, and were run through the body in a minute ; and sºv,
*EM Right, say I.

Whilst Edward was fighting this battle, those marauding Scotch-
men, under David Bruce their new king (as great a robber, my dears,
as his father), thought they might take advantage of the unprotected
state of the kingdom, and came across the border in great force, to
plunder as usual. But I am happy to state that her Majesty, Queen
Philippa, heading a small English army, caught them at a place
called Nevil's Cross, and utterly defeated the thievish rogues, killing
vast numbers of them. She was as kind-hearted, too, as she was
brave. For at the siege of Calais, after Edward had reduced the town,
he swore, in his rage at the resistance of the garrison, that he would
hang six of the principal inhabitants. These unhappy six came be-
fore him “in their shirts, with halters round their necks,” the old
chroniclers say, and as, in fact, is proved by the following portraits of

The Queen interceded for their lives; the Monarch granted her
prayer, and her Majesty gave the poor burghers what must have been
very acceptable to them after six months' starvation, a comfortable
meal of victuals.
“I hope they went home first To DREss Fon DINNER,” here re-
marked an intelligent pupil. |
“Of course, they must have done so, my dear,” answered Miss
Tickletoby ; “but for my part, I believe that the whole scene must
have been arranged previously between the King and Queen; indeed.
as you will see by the picture, neither of them can help laughing at
the ridiculous figure the burgesses cut.”
[The company separated in immense good humour, saying that the
Lecturer had, on this occasion, mingled amusement with much stºn
instruction.]

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“A WORD TO THE WISE.”
-
Worthy Punch,
IRMLY convinced that benevolence
is the foundation of your character,
and led away by no arguments to the
contrary, based upon the harsh treat-
ment you have been known, under
moments of unusual domestic excite-
ment, to put upon your respected con-
sort, to you I appeal in favour of a
much-oppressed and injured class—a
class who have ever been taught to
look up with reverence to you, as at
once their great founder and the ideal
of excellence towards which their ef-
forts are directed. You will under-
stand I mean the actors, for whose
advocacy I am sure you will readily
grant a small allotment of your pre-
cious space.
You must be aware how much it has been the fashion of late, especi-
ally with disappointed dramatists, to heap every species of abuse and ca-
lumny upon actors, calling them a pampered, and capricious brood, who
feed upon the very farina of the author's brains, throwing him the husks
to starve on ; whose sport it is to thwart his dearest object—publicity
and success—working in malignant secrecy, or breaking out in mutinous
insolence. These are the absurd charges which are forged by restless
discontent and the rabid disappointment of syncretic folly, with a view to
deprive them of their just supremacy in the dramatic commonwealth and
reduce them to the state of mere tools in the hands of insatiate ambition
and erratic imbecility; and the impudence of the object proposed is only
surpassed by that of the means employed to attain it. They say that
actors are overpaid, when the well.known fact stares all in the face, that
the emoluments of actors are not more than ten times those of authors.
And this is overpaid, forsooth ! Can it be said that this proportion any-
thing like measures the immense difference in the relative importance of
the two classes Is not the author's work a mere rude and senseless
chaos, until the actor breathes into it the soul of his genius, and makes
it a living thing What would Shakspere have been, but for Dick Bur-
bidge and his successors | What would Sheridan Knowles be, but for
Charles Kean I Look at the Syncretics—look at the unacted—crawling
nonentities I Again, it is maintained by some, that the present feeble
state of the drama is owing to the overgrowth of the pretensions of actors
in general, and particularly of those harbingers of an approaching re-
generation, the stars; when the very contrary is the true state of the
case, for never will the Drama flourish in full, free, and vigorous prospe-
rity, until authors are made in all subservient to the clear and practical
views of the actors. With regard to stars, I look upon them as
vessels of salvation to the Drama, whose destined part it is to bring us
back to that unity in dramatic representations so justly honoured by the
ancients, and so madly renounced by ourselves; and through their efforts
we shall even surpass antiquity, for I trust the time not distant when
a Macready and a Charles Kean, walking in the traces of the late Mr.
Mathews, will give us a tragic monopolylogue. As, however, these in-
sidious charges are, in spite of their manifest folly and iniquity, gaining
some ground with the public, and one or two actors have had the weakness
to show some signs of submission to the impudent assumption of dra-
matists, I have composed a few steel drops, in the shape of maxims, to
strengthen their failing constitutions, and guide them under circumstances
so perilous to their highly-beneficial prerogatives.
ADVICE TO ACTORS.
As requiring the attendance of actors at the reading of a new play is
one of those arbitrary enforcements springing from the vanity of authors
who never tire of reciting their own works, and as the object alleged as a
pretext for it—namely, possessing the actor with the whole scope of the
piece—is never answered, since the general custom is for every actor to
pay attention to his own part only, if you have any better use for your
time, absent yourself without scruple.
Always read your part at rehearsal. This saves you from taxing your
memory until it is really required; or if you owe the prompter a grudge,
take care to leave it at home, and he will then have the trouble to read it
for you.
If you are slow of study, or fond of “taking it easy,” and you think the
length of your part out of proportion with the honour it may do you, cut
freely. If youthereby render the piece unintelligible, so much the worse
for the author.
If, on the contrary, you are a star, and find any of the minor characters
have effective speeches to make, insist upon taking them for yourself; you
will thereby concentrate all the applause on your own part, and give a
greater unity to the interest of the piece.
If an author make any observation or suggestion of any kind during
rehearsal, stare at him as if astonished at his presumption; should he
repeat the offence, tell him that if he thinks you cannot play the part, he
had better cast it otherwise. . Such impertinent intermeddling is much too
frequent, and should be checked at once.
An actor may frequently improve the text of his author by substituting
a weak expression for a strong one, or an old and well-tried joke for one
of . issue. This it is his duty to do, although an ungrateful one, for
the author, blinded by vanity, is sure to say you have spoiled it.
If, during the rehearsals of a piece you discover that your own part
which you had been led to believe was the leading one, is likely to be
rivalled by that of another, refuse indignantly to become an accomplice in
so flagrant a breach of the great principle of dramatic unity; and if you
are forced to play it, nobly make a sacrifice of your own part by walking
through it. This may possibly ruin the piece, but at any rate you will
have the satisfaction of knowing that you did your duty.
If you are a good actor, or reputed so, and are married to a lady in the
contrary case, refuse to play in any piece wherein she shall not play the
heroine. You will thereby increase your popularity by the reputation of
a good husband, and distinguish yourself as a defeuder of the great prin-
ciple of dramatic unity, as you and your wife make up but one.
An actor will frequently find it advisable to descend from his high
position and show some favour and courtesy to an author, as the latter,
delighted at the condescension, will be sure in his next preface to sugar
him with sweet praise and crown him with triple laurels. The trumpet
once well blown, he may throw off his disguise and resume hostilities
whensoever he shall have occasion.
Friendships between author and actor are unnatural, and tend to no
good : if, therefore, you find yourself growing into any such ties, take the
first opportunity of showing your teeth when your friend least expects it.
Lastly, for all that relates to shirking parts, shamming illness, and every
other artifice or manoeuvre by which an actor may exercise a wholesome
tyranny over an author, after the fashion of a cat with a mouse, let him
refer to the annals of the Italian opera, where the manager is the victim,
particularly under the names Ronconi, Poggi, &c. He will find it a study
fraught with many a useful lesson.
ADVICE TO PLAYGOERS,
onr. of the JUNiort Judges.
As the theatrical season is about to commence in good earnest, we feel
ourselves called upon to lay down a few rules for the conduct of that small
and fast diminishing number of her Majesty's subjects, who still, with all
the bigotry of antiquarianism, rejoice in the title of Play-goer.
In the heathenish language of France there is an idom which implies
that the audience are “assisting” the scene with their best attention, with
their readiest sympathies; the Frenchman does not, in our straightfor-
ward, bold, Britannic phrase “go to the play;” no, he sneakingly covers
his visit thus—he goes “pour assister a la comédie.” He is in the play-
house to give himself instantly up to the illusion of the scene; the curtain
is drawn, and he watches, the intent observer of the mimic game of life
before him. . He weeps, he laughs, in obedience to the mystery of the
author and the actor, and therefore shows himself a flighty foolish person,
by the very ingenuousness of his impulses. We hope an Englishman is
above this weakness, and it is our hope that induces us to give him that
solid advice which may confirm him in his strength.
Englishman, you have paid your money at the door. (We, of course, do
not address ourselves to those elegant paupers who go with orders in their
own carriages.) Well, having paid, you are to consider that you have in-
yested so much money in a speculation upon a play-bill. Take care, and
have your money's worth. Remember, there is no pleasure in the matter—
the whole affair is a thing of hard pence and shillings, a piece of mere busi-
ness. Thus, take your seat, buttoned up to the throat in a thick surtout of
determination not to be easily pleased. Ring every joke as you would ring
a shilling—consider every poetic passage as you would consider the vali-
dity of a sovereign—and never for a moment, unbuttoning the said suit
of determination only to admire upon the very hardest terms—surrender
yourself at once to the inspiration of the author, to the passion of the
actor. If, in the end, when the curtain drops, you are really satisfied,
make this straight with your conscience—it is not without having done all
in your power to come away a grumbler.
“Fair play's a jewel,” as Richardson said when he had realised a fortune.

THE TOETRY OF THE PALATE.
fill-ologY.
' The soul of poetry is sentiment. We hear much of the Sentiment
of Flowers, and we know that the star of evening, the morning
Dew, the moss-rose, and the ivy-mantled tower, cum quibusdam aliis,
are also considered to stand in a special relation to the mental
diathesis so called. But the fact is, that sentiment, like monlight,
is capable of investing the most common-place—may, the vilest objects,
with a hue of beauty. Beneath the silvery smile of Night's mild
Queen, a pig-sty becomes picturesque—a union workhouse inter-
esting. Then why may not Imagination gild a stew, or cast her
rose-tents of loveliness on a round of beef?
She may, and does—the subjoined epistle will demonstrate the
fact. How it came into our hands—no matter, let it suffice to say,
that both the writer and recipient are now no more. The former, a
youth of great promise, came to an untimely end fºom a malady
which, but for the kind cruelty of Fortune, would probably have
abbreviated the career of the great Johnson. He was guilty of an
amiable indiscretion, which the voracious moralist, it is said, com-
plained that he never had an opportunity of committing ; he got, one
foul day, as much wall-fruit as he could eat, and ate it. He was
speedily attacked by cholera, and is now “not where he eats, but
where he is eaten.” “Peace " as he would have pathetically
expressed it, “to his hash " The object of his affections, she to
whom the fond effusion was addressed, may also be said to have
ceased to exist; for she is not what she was. She was Miss Cutlett—
she is Mrs. Dollop. Her heart was broken by the loss of her beloved
(which destroyed her appetite for a day, and sensibly affected her
for several), -so she threw it away on a Common Councilman.
The ensuing letter preceded but a few days a lock of hair and a
barrel of oysters, his dying gifts to the idol of his soul.
London, Sept. 23, 18–.
My Even DEAR MARY ANNE,
The affection which I entertain for you is intense as that of the
turtle for his mate—or of the Alderman for his turtle. And this
reminds me, duck, to inform you, that I yesterday enjoyed, for the
first time, the pleasure of tasting turtle-soup. How often, while we
were roaming by moonlight, you have longed to know what it was
like l—and now, at last, I can satisfy you. What do I say? Alas !
Words are inadequate to the description of its charms. What my
palate felt, my tongue is unable to tell. The shadow of a shade of
ecstacy is all that I can express. But what then —“I give thee all
I can : no more.” What a happy thing it is, sweet, that we so entirely
coincide in our taste—nay, in our tastes; for we not only agree in
liking good things, but also, with a few exceptions, (of which more
by and by,) have the same ideas as to what is good. So that, should
our conversation, when we come to participate in domestic bliss, be
only “whether the mutton shall be boiled or roast,” there will be
no chance of our having “a dispute about that.”—But the soup is
getting cold.
You must know, that yesterday I received my quarter's salary.
Immediately on leaving the office, I repaired to that excellent dining-
house, the “Blue Posts.” “Well,” said I, “waiter, what have you
got t” “Why, sir,” said he, “there's cod-fish and oyster-sauce, and
haddock, and soles, very nice ; and then, sir,” (and he lowered his
voice, and looked religious) “there's turtle " “There is, is there "I
exclaimed: “then bring me some turtle.” “Turtle for one, sir!—yes,
sir,” he replied, and disappeared.
I recollect, dear chicken, when, after receiving that ever-to-be-
cherished note of yours, I went at ten minutes to nine on that beau-
tiful summer evening (if you remember, you had had hashed mutton,
you said, for dinner) to wait for you beneath your lattice. I watched the
light in it for a quarter of an hour, and at last you came. Never had I
endured such an agony of expectation before, and till yesterday never
have I since. But while I was waiting for the luxury I had ordered,
(I should tell you that I was as hungry as if I had fasted five hours,)
I certainly was as nearly as possible in the state of mind in which I
felt during that long, long fifteen minutes which elapsed before you
gladdened my sight. I tried to amuse myself with the Times; and
read—but apprehended not. I then endeavoured to beguile the lin-
gering moments by counting the letters in the leader, and afterwards
by trying to learn one of Robins's advertisements by heart. At last,
after what seemed an eternity, the turtle came. It was served up in
plate, an honour which at this establishment is never paid to inferior
viands.
Imagine to yourself the one moment of rapturous impatience du-
ring which I was filling my plate ;-the rich incense of the steam
which, regaling my nostrils, formed a brief prelude to the more sub-
stantial treat which was presently mine.
Mary Anne you have tasted mock turtle, I know. Mock turtle
is very nice ; but, oh it is nothing to real. It no more resembles it
than Clara Wyat does my Mary Anne when she is dressed like you.
The complexion, the eyes, the hair, are alike ; but how different the
tout-ensemble 1 So in colour, consistence, and ostensible ingredients, do
the two dishes agree; the disparity lies between the spirit, the soul,
the essential but intangible flavour which pervades each. The one
great distinction between you and Clara is, that you have a mind, and
she next to none. What your mind is to hers, green fat is to calf's-
head. Then there is an indescribable sensation which comes over
one while regaling on this most exquisite of dainties, but which mock
turtle does not excite; a sort of feeling which must have rewarded
the courage of the man who first ate an oyster; a dizzy, dreadful,
delightful consciousness that you are banqueting on a species of
reptile.
*. will ask what I thought of the meat, or fleshy part of the
turtle. It was savoury in the extreme, and, I assure you, quite de-
fies imitation. But the green fat, the green fat l—those are morsels
for the gods. By the by, there is a passage in Milton's “Paradise
Lost,” which, I remember, struck me exceedingly when I read it ; and
what I have just said brings it to my mind. It represents the Father
of Mankind, and his celestial visitant, Raphael, enjoying themselves
in a shady bower. Thus it proceeds —
“So down they sat,
And to their viands fell; nor seemingly
The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss
Of Theologians, but wi'. despatch
Of real hunger, and *.coctive heat
To transubstantiate.”
Oh! my Mary Anne, if in the mansions of the blest the happy
spirits dine, who knows if even the delicacy of which I yesterday par-
took may not hereafter seem to us scarcely more relishing than
common ox-tail does now 1
Nº
colonial, ProDUCE.
They brought me a lemon with my soup. I first took a spoonful
or two without, and then with that condiment, which, I think, im-
proves it if used in moderation. But what a long letter I have
written Let me be brief. Oh, my heart's treasure I would you had
been with me yesterday; then, indeed, there would have been, instead
of one, as the waiter expressed it in calling below to the cook, “Two
turtles in No.4.”
Let me seriously advise you, my own pigeon-pie, to eat apple-sauce
with goose; it improves it amazingly—it does indeed. And, pray, do
not be afraid of sage and onions, either with that or with roast pork.
It would indeed be a pity if we felt differently on a subject so peculi-
arly important as this.

I had almost forgotten—and what an omission it would have been
—to tell you that with my turtle I had some of the most superb iced
punch it was ever my good fortune to taste. Thus, you see, my
patty, I dined like a deity, on ambrosia and nectar. When I say
dined, however, I do not mean that I ate nothing else : and,
as I was not, after having “seated myself,” as the ghost in “Hamlet”
says, “in a celestial bed,” going “to prey on garbage,” and as there
was some hashed venison ready, I had some of that. I have often
expressed my feelings to you with regard to venison, so I need not
repeat them now.
Ah! my dumpling, people may say what they like, but there is no
earthly pleasure in which mutual minds can share like that of eating
and drinking. All other tastes will decay with age ; but a taste for
good things will leave us but with life. Let us hope, then, in the
happy bonds of Hymen, to live and eat together while life's brief
span shall last. And when, in the decline of our days, we lose our
teeth—what matter?—we'll have a new set of terro-metallics, mounted
in fine gold, which will enable us to eat away as fast as ever;-yes!
till the cold grave shall hide us, in spite of our teeth we will feed on.
Adieu you will have goose on Michaelmas day for dinner;-think
of me !
Your own true love,
WITT LEs HAM.
P.S.—As soon as “Kitchiner” is bound, I will send him, and at the
same time forward your album with the receipts in it.
THE COURT.
(from THE PUNCH NewsMAN.)
Windsor Court, Strand, Sept. 29.
The Editors of Punch left London-bridge for Fleet-street on Thurs-
day by the fourpenny boat, and having transacted important business
at Mr. Dogsear's book-stall, returned in an omnibus and pair, with out-
riders. Their Editorial Highnesses looked remarkably well.
The City correspondent departed early on Saturday for Ramsgate to
enjoy the sports of the season. In the evening he met a select party at
the Royal Library, and bagged two brace of pincushions, a silver toothpick,
and a bottle of scent, at the raffle.
Despatches have been received at the office from our ambassador at
Boulogne. As they passed through the post-office with no longer deten-
tion than was necessary for the payment of the postage, we are flattered
with the hope that the unpleasant differences between the adminis-
tration des postes and the London newspapers have been satisfactorily
adjusted.
On Saturday the whole of the Cabinet met the Chancellor of the
Exchequer by special appointment at the Treasury, or Till, and trans-
acted important business over the counter. They then retired to the
Albany tavern and partook of a sumptuous repast, in which gigot
róti and pommes-de-terre frites were the most prominent dishes. The
harp and fiddle band attended in the passage, and performed the fol-
lowing pieces in admirable style :-
“We won't go home till morning.”... ... Bellini.
“Lo, here the gentle Lark.” . . . . . . . Sir Henry Bishop.
“Nix my Dolly, pals, fake away.”.. Handel.
—The illustrious party separated at an early hour (in the morning), each
paying his own expenses.
THE QUEEN AND THE PROVOST.
WHEN her Majesty saw the Lord Provost, she remarked to him in the
course of the interview that the affairs of the city could not be in better
hands, for he would never be liable to precipitation under the weightiest
of circumstances; and before acting upon any occasion, he would be sure
to sleep upon it.
It has been suggested to devote the space at Trafalgar-square to
a market for flowers ; and we have no doubt the suggestion would meet
the views of those sincere votaries of Flora, who plant out mignionette
every morning from broken gally-pots into button-holes. The Herald,
with whom the idea originates, would no doubt be glad of any market for
its poppies, which hang on hand terribly. Several female flower-dealers
have already taken up the notion, and may be seen entering inwards with
large cargoes of lavender, in the neighbourhood of Nelson's column.
PRINCE ALBERT was made a Doctor of Law the other day by the Uni-
versity of Edinburgh, and was remarking over the royal dinner-table how
thoroughly complimentary he must consider the degree, when conferred on
one so little acquainted with law as he happens to be at present. One of
the equerries being desirous of saying something flattering, remarked that
the Prince was not such a tyro, for he had been seen that morning with a
gun in his hand, absorbed in the contemplation of Hare on Discovery.
SOME MORE GOOD JOKES.
Without the least wish to accuse any one of premeditated murder,
we must affirm that the Shakspere Society will certainly be the death of
us, well seasoned as our wooden constitution is to all kinds of casual-
ties. Not content with throwing the whole universe into convulsions by
the poignancy of their jokes in “Ben Jonson's Conversations with
Drummond of Hawthornden,” they have issued another screaming
volume, if possible ten times more humorous than the last, called
“Fools and Jesters, or the Nest of Ninnies.” The publication of this
book has, in all probability, led to the production of those sledge-
hammer sarcasms with which the Morning Herald has lately been
crushing the Times into horizontal smash. At the same time, the date
of the original MS. of the “Nest of Ninnies” removes the idea that
it was intended as a hit either at the slumbering civic dignitaries
of Edinburgh, or the Syncretics. We subjoin one or two of the most
stunning bits of fun. . The first paragraph affords a curious proof of
the trifling difference between the appreciation of fun by our Northern
brethren in the year 1608, and at present —
“Jemmy Camber, the fat foole, put to sea in a ship, at whose departure
they discharged ordinance, as one that departed from the land with the
king's fauor; the Earle Huntley was sent with him to sea to accompany
him, so high he was esteemed with the king, who hearing the ordinance
goe off, would ask what doe they now Marry, says the Earle, they shoot
at our enemies. O, saies hee, hit, I pray God . Againe they discharge.
What doe they now quoth he. Marry, now the enemie shoots at us. O,
misse, I praie God 1 (sayes Jamy Camber.) So euer after it was a jest
in the Scottish Court.” e
“Jack Oates, sitting at cardes all alone, was dealing to himselfe at vide
ruffe (for that was the game he ioyed in), and as he spide a knaue—“Ah,
knauve, art there tº quoth he. When he spide a king— King, by your
leaue,' quoth he. If hee spide a queene— Queene Richard, art come 1”
quoth he, and would kneele downe, and bid God blesse her Majestie.”
“Jack Miller, welcomed to all places, and bard of none, came to a gen-
tleman, who being at dinner, requested him for mirth to make him a play,
which he did, and sing Derries Faire, which was in this manner. First
it is to be notted, hee strutted hugely, and could neyther pronounce b nor
p, and thus he began :—
‘As I went to Derries Fair, there was I ware of a jolly begger,
Mistris Annis M Thomas, under a tree mending of shoone,
Mistris Annis M Thomas, night braue beggers euery one.”
And so forward ; but the jest was to heare him pronounce ‘braue beggars,'
and his qualitie was, after hee began his song, no laughing could put im
out of it.”
“‘Marry,’ sayes Will Sommers to King Harry, “I say a dirt dauber is
the cleanliest trade in the world.” “Out on it,” sayes the king, ‘that is the
foulest, for hee is dirty up to the elbows.’ ‘I,’ sayes Will, but then he
washes him cleane again, and eats his meate cleanly enough.” “I promise
thee, Will,’ says the King, ‘thou hast a pretty foolish wit.'”
Now, in pure benevolence, to prevent the Shakspere Society from get-
ting idle for lack of subjects to work upon, we subjoin a few good stories,
similar to the above, and that have never before been made public. They
may print them under any title they like, and we can insure their suc-
cess, for we begin to perceive the peculiar vein of humour suited to their
subscribers.
A merrie . “Burbage, goeing somtyme to Winchestere with Shakspere
conceite of in the baggage-wain of the railwaie, sees Edward Aileyne
Richarde in the Kingstone station. “Ho, fayre Ned, says he, “what
Burbage. dost there " . Marry, I'll tell thee, Dickom,” saies hee, ‘I
lack companie.’ ‘Then wee will give you our'n,’ sayes Wille Shakspere.
And in truthe they wente on merrilie and with much laughter.
“A conynge man did take Tarleton his effigies in a Daguerro-
t -
A º type. ‘Ha,’ says, he, “this do I lyke much, because it.
Tarleton. is much lyke.' Twhº saies Dekker, “I like it more
becos it holds its peace ;” and soe went on his waie.
of Henslowe “Philip Henslowe could neuer abide a hack cab. VPon, a

INTELLIGENCE OF SOME OLD ACQUAINTANCES.
With the return of the anatomical session at our medical schools
have also arrived some of our old friends to prosecute their studies.
The introductory lecture at our own establishment took place
towards the end of the past week, and the majority of our ancient
students attended to hear Dr. Wurzel deliver it.
Mr. Muff, on the strength of being appointed surgeon to the Clod-
pole Union, has established an assistant at twenty pounds a-year. He
was therefore enabled to come up from Clodpole with comfort to
himself, and brought Jack Randall with him, who has determined
upon being a medical man, and as such has entered to the lectures.
We may from time to time give a few notices of his career.
At present he is settled, through Mr. Muff's advice, in what he
terms a very jolly crib, on the third floor—bedroom and parlour all
in one. He pays for what fire he burns, and uses his own blacking
and brushes—the former of which he purchases at a penny a pot in
the form of paste, thus abolishing the long tolerated imposition of
a shilling a-week for boots and shoes. On Mr. Muff's recommendation
also, he buys his own coals at a potato-shed near his dwelling : he
fetches and keeps them in his carpet bag, which looks very respect-
able, only it makes the lining rather dirty.
By the hour appointed for the lecture every seat in the school
theatre was filled. The regular teachers of course occupied the bottom
row, and immediately over them the usual ring of old gentlemen with
large noses, red faces,and grey hair, who attend all introductory lectures
and are supposed to be governors of the hospital, or house-surgeons
of the dark ages. Then there were a great many good young men,
raw from the country, accompanied by their fathers, who had deter-
mined upon going round to all the schools in succession, and entering
to that which appeared to offer the greatest advantages at
the lowest price. The old pupils had dispersed about in little
parties of two or three each, and were amusing themselves according
to their different inclinations. Jack Randall had already made
friends with all he considered worthy of his esteem, and appeared
quite as much at home as if he had been there for years. The ruling
powers had covered all the ledges in front of the seats with a thick
coating of paint and sand, to prevent, if possible, the perpetration of
any more peculiarly anatomical diagrams upon them by wilful stu-
dents; but this made little difference to Mr. Muff, who was already
hard at work with the stump of a scalpel, hacking out a representa-
tion of a figure in a state of suspension by the neck, under which he
had written the name of the anatomical lecturer.
Manhug and Rapp came in together, and their entrance was
- greeted with loud applause by their old friends, which courtesy they
acknowledged by taking sights, winking their eyes, laying their
fingers along their noses, and other familiar demonstrations of affec-
tion, previously to taking their places near Muff and Randall. When
they were settled, Mr. Manhug took a small box from his pocket,
made of wood, and shaped like a pear, from which, with great
caution, he produced a blue-bottle fly, having a piece of thread
tied to one of its legs, terminated by a little square morsel
of paper. He then gave the insect his liberty ; and provided a
fund of amusement for the class, by its ceaseless flights over the bald
heads of the governors and old gentlemen below, much to their an-
noyance, who could not imagine what on earth the perpetual tickling
could be. As for Rapp, he had brought the whole ceiling into a state
of eruption with lumps of masticated paper, to which he had attached
little men by long silks pulled out from the pocket-handkerchief of a
new man who sat below, quite unconscious of the abstraction.
“How d'ye do, sir!” cried Randall to a perfect stranger, who came
in at the lecturers' door, looking very frightened, as strangers always
do at a medical school—and with some reason.
“I am very well, I thank you, sir,” replied the newcomer, with
much complaisance.
“That's all right,” said Randall, “and so am I. I hope you'll stand
a pot of half-and-half after the lecture.”
“I shall be very happy,” returned the stranger.
“With a cinder in it, of course 1" asked Randall.
The stranger, not exactly comprehending this speech, looked much
confused.
“Never mind him, sir,” cried Muff.
—quite lost.”
“Never care what he says,” continued Randall; “you stand the
Hospital Medoc, and then I shall be very happy to show you the
lions of London in return—the Fleet-ditch, Clare-market, the outside
of the Olympic Theatre, and anything else that won't cost me
anything.”
“He’s a very low young man
All this badinage continued until Dr. Wurzel made his appearance.
What he said, how he was received, and other diverting matters, we
leave until next week—a sly trick to ensure he sale of the forth-
coming Number.
ADWERTISEMENT EXTRAORDINARY.
When in the filmy chambers of the brain
Her photographic tints pale Mem'ry rears;
When the heart throbs, till the head aches again,
With “thoughts (albeit) that lie too deep for tears;”
Oh! say what patent balsam may be found
To minister unto a mind distraught—
To cover skin-deep, if not heal, the wound–
Where can such nectar draught from Lethe's stream be bought?
Is it 'mid Pleasure's fair Circean bowers,
Where woman's check outvies the blushing rose—
Where Mirth and Joy lead on the laughing hours,
And the red wine-cup fevers as it flows?
Is it where Beauty's eye, as diamonds bright,
Like meteor flame, betraying to his doom
The wandering hind, reflects a treacherous light
O'er the morass, to lure the wanderer to a tomb P
Or is it whilst excited Avarice flings
Her maddening influence o'er the gamester's path—
Where fiend-like music from the dice-box rings
In his charm'd ear, whilst echoing demons laugh?
Or in the statesman's bold though stern career.
Whose burning words, from Freedom's blazing pyre,
Call on the coldest hearts to “wake and hear !”
And kindle into flame the Patriot's smother'd fire?
Or is it in the sunny path of Fame,
Where walks the poet—his fair temple bound
With wreaths immortal—whilst his envied name
Becomes familiar as a household sound 2
No—none of these possess the oblivious draught,
Welcomed alike by peasant as by queen.
To “chill the sense of care,” it must be quaff'd
Fresh sparkling from the fount, in Punch's Magazine !
The public voice the fact aloud proclaims,
Approving crowds attest it:—if unwise
Or sceptic heads have doubts, the great Sir James
Clark (the Queen's own) the same did analyse,
And “genuine” pronounced it—nor deny
The fact does “Mrs. Johnstone :" Champagne lunch
'Gainst cheese and ale – her syrup 's all my eye—
The patent for all care is held alone by Punch I. B.
THE PRESENT TO THE QUEEN. -
The present of four Spanish horses to Her Majesty has been the source
of a good deal of pleasantry in the Palace, and the royal dinner-table has
been enlivened by many a joke on the subject. When Her Majesty first
heard that the gift had arrived, she inquired their colour, and on being
told they were chesnut, brown, and bay, remarked that at all events, the
present did not consist of “four Spanish chesnuts.” . After the laughter
at this sally had in some degree subsided, it was intimated by the Queen
that she should bestow a pair of them on her royal consort ; and upon
looking at them, Her Majesty at once fixed on the brown as a gift to the
Prince, accompanying the donation by the remark, that “he could not
now complain she had never given him a brown’—a witticism that was
fully explained to his Royal Highness by the master of the buck-hounds.
JUSTICE TO IRELAND.
The late Dr. Ireland, among other charitable bequests, has left 2000l.
for an erhibition to Oriel College. We understand that an application has
been made to the executors, by Madame Tussaud, who requests that the
exhibition to which the money left is to be appropriated may be her unri-
valled Wax Work.
EXCHANGE NO ROBBERY.
The Mayor of Preston, in contradicting the report that the Duke of
Brunswick had been taken up by mistake as a member of the swell mob,
declares that the paragraph related not to his Royal Highness, but to some
other vagabond. If the Duke had really been transferred to prison by
the van, it would have been certainly a new way of passing a light
sovereign.
“Are you looking for any one in particular " as the mite said to the microscope.
“You can't make a noise here," as the wooden pavement said to the omnibus.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GREAT WIG MEETING AT DOWER.
YEstEnday, a meeting was held in Dover Castle, the governor of
that part of the building which affords a temporary retreat for come-
dians and other culprits having in the handsomest manner given up
his apartments for the purpose of the day. The Mayor was unani-
mously called to the chair.
His Worship briefly and pithily explained the objects of the meet-
ing. Perhaps, he observed, the human animal could not appear in a
nobler attitude than that of making an apology. (Hear.) To own
himself wrong was, perhaps, the sublimest confession a man could
make. (Loud cheers.) When a man stood up, and showed himself
the ass he really was, he was then, he feared not to say it, in the
words of Shakspeare, “the polygon of animals.” (Vociferous cheers, and
cries of “You ought to know.”) He was proud to say he stood in that
position. As one of the magistrates, he had penned the prison regu-
lations which improved the time of offenders waiting for bail, by cut-
ting their hair. He was one of those who had added to the sword of
justice a very sharp pair of scissors. Two actors had been cropped
—(hisses)—let him be heard; two players had been shorn; but, in
obedience to public feeling, that meeting had been convened to make
a practical manifestation of sympathy towards those who were called
the sufferers. For his part, he should say no more. (Applause, and
cries of “Thank’ee.”
Mr. MUDDLE wit (a magistrate) rose to propose the first resolu-
tion. He had had a finger in the regulations—he had thought them
very proper; but as Sir James Graham thought differently, he now
thought differently too. He had, therefore, to propose that a sub-
scription should be opened to furnish the cropped comedians, Messrs.
FitzJAMEs and GLADston E, with two superb wigs; the subscription
to be rigidly confined to a crown. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. GANDERHEAD (a magistrate) seconded the motion. He con-
fessed he had been a scissor-man—he was one no longer. He had had,
he might say it, a passion for cropping criminals: that passion was
now dormant. He had at home what he called the “Felons' Album,”
in which, every shade of human hair was harmoniously arranged,
and all from the denuded heads of the dwellers of Dover Castle.
(Hisses.) He should, that very night by mail, forward the volume
to the Home Office. (Cheers.) In seconding the resolution, he
thought it would add to the graceful liberality of the proceeding,
if Messrs. FitzJAMEs and GLADston E were, in the selection of their
wigs, allowed the full choice of colour, without any arbitrary refer-
ence to their previous locks.
Mr. Eben Ezen Sulphu RLY (a Magistrate) regretted that he had
lived to that hour. (Cries of “So do tre.”) When the vane of Wailing-
and-gnashing Chapel wanted gilding, to subscribe money to thatch
the backsliding heads of carnal strollers 1 (Laughter, and shouts of
“Go it, old Bluelight.”) In what a state of voluptuous wickedness had
they fallen I Had they read the evidence of the prison doctor : When
he examined the malefactors, for he would call them so, what did he
report —why, that they were clean clean The aiders and abetters
of Belzebub clean In shirts | Yes—he shuddered whilst he said
it—in “fine linen " (Laughter.) He would, to his last breath,
denounce the resolution—he would die, speaking against the Wigs
Let the men of Dover beware : If they thus nourished and suc-
coured the heathen, there was not a hair in each of their wigs
but would not some day or the other pull down a thunderbolt .
(Great confusion, amidst which the speaker sat down.)
The resolution was then put and carried, and an express sent off to
Wilson, the theatrical wig-maker, to appear at Dover to measure the
comedians.
We had almost omitted to state, that a person (whose name we
could not learn) put it to the meeting whether, if Messrs. Glad-
stone and FITzu AMEs were awarded with full wigs, Mr. Frederick
For Cooper (the late manager) did not deserve a natural scratch The
question, however, was not seconded.
The cause of the drama is, evidently, advancing in Dover. The
turnkey of the Castle has already made 20l. of the hair cut from the
actors, to be made up into ear-rings and lockets for the ladies of the
town and vicinity.
ICE, OR THE WIDOW
THAT very multitudinous class of her Majesty's subjects, whose hopes
and fears are singularly influenced by the weal and woe of his Majesty of
Hanover, have, for the past fortnight, been kept in a state of intense anx-
iety touching King ERNest, that interesting potentate. The Standard
prints a piece of brief epistolary woe, assuring us that his Majesty has
taken ice into his stomach, and is, therefore, about to exchange his Hano-
verian crown for a celestial diadem. Great is the consternation at some
parts of the West-End. The statue of the Duke of York immediately
despatches the policeman at the base of the column to make inquiries at
St. James's Palace, and the corn-cutter and other tradesmen to King
ERNest display a like attention. There is, however, some impending ca-
lamity threatening his Majesty; and the danger is at length known in its
true shape, namely, that of the widow of a German lawyer. This perii is,
however, not unaccompanied by feverish symptoms, and for a fortnight, at
least, his Majesty was lying, nicely balanced between the burial and the
marriage service. We subjoin (from our own correspondent) two of the
bulletins:—
“Dusseldorf, Sept. 13, 1842.
“His Majesty the King of Hanover has passed a restless night. Oc-
casionally he has talked of wedding-rings, and shown other febrile sym-
ptoms. Towards the morning, however, he sat bolt upright in his bed, and
placing his hand upon the region of his heart, said— Ice–ice." This
indicates his returning consciousness.
(Signed) “NoN FLAM (Court Physician).”
We give the last bulletin received :—
“Dusseldorf, Sept. 20, 1842.
“His Majesty is fast returning to health. He has made two jokes, and
Madame de Beulwitz a Countess. All are as well as can be expected.”
(Signed as before.)
...” any other bulletins reach us, we shall give them in a second
edition.

its original pewter and the lips of the imbiber thereof. State whether the
principle of Daniels' Sustaining Battery could be applied so as to form
two pots out of one.

two copper coins produce the phenomenon of an “excited conductor.”
Civil ENGINEERING, &c.
1. Given the initial velocity (V) of a fresh man, and the constant in-
crement (f) of half-and-half, to find the velocity at the end of term (t),

velocity.
2. Given the quantity of Welch rabbits consumed by an elderly gentle-
man in the Cyder-cellars, with the equations to his centre of gravity and

called fast !
N B.—Should the gratitude of the students be “screwed up to the
sticking 9. rather standing) point,” we shall with much pleasure receive
a piece of pewter, with a neat and appropriate interior. We shall for this
purpose, during the first week of Term, attend regularly at Bushell's,
where we will divulge ourselves by reading alternate portions of Hall's

PUNCH2S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER XI.-ON THE NECESSITY OF HYPOCRISY.—STORY OF THE
i.eMON MERCHANT.
No, I have no sympathy, my son—none whatever, for you. What
to have scraped a very promising acquaintance with a man of
Alderman Bilberry's wealth—to have had him more than once nod to
you ; and then, when fortune—a happy fortune as it might have
turned out—throws you both together in the same Greenwich boat,
to lose the alderman for ever! You will say, the alderman acted
meanly, dirtily, shabbily ; will tell me, that you saw him only five
minutes before take twopence in change for a glass of ginger-
beer, when, at the same time, he regretted to the man who played the
clarionet, who came round the deck to gather for himself and musical
companions, that “he had not a copper about him, or would give it
with the greatest pleasure.” What devil, may I ask you, tempted
you to jog the alderman's memory on the ginger-beer and penny-
pieces ! You will say to me, the alderman told a lie, the alderman
acted shabbily ; and, therefore, you reproved him, and, what you
doubtless think a splendid peacock's feather in your cap, you reproved
him with a joke I shall certainly write no more to you, if I find
my letters do you so little good.
My son, never see the meannesses of mankind. Let men hedge,
and shirk, and shift, and lie, and with faces of unwrinkled adamant
tell you the most monstrous falsehoods—either in their self-glorifica-
tion, or to disguise some habitual paltriness; still, never detect the
untruth, never lay your finger on the patch they have so bunglingly
sewed upon their moral coat, but let them depart with the most reli-
gicus persuasion that they have triumphantly bamboozled you. By
these means, although you are most efficiently assisting in the hypo-
crisy of life, you will be deemed a sociable, a most good-natured
fellow. Be stone-blind, and you will be benevolent; be deaf, and
you will be all heart. To have an insight—or at least to show you
have it—into the dirty evasions of life, is to have a moral squint. To
lay your finger upon a plague-spot, is to be infected with malice.
No : though you meet with men scurfed with moral leprosy, see not
the scales, but cry out lustily, “What perfect gentlemen : " To dis-
cover meanness in men, is, in men's opinion, to be strongly tinctured
with the iniquity.
Like him who should handle stolen musk, he would in the nos-
trils of his neighbours smell for some time of the commodity.
Mr. Chaucer, in allusion to the devil, says of him,
“He hath in Jewe's heart his waspè's nest.”
Now, what we nominally call the devil, has built—by the agency of
his demon wasps, Pride, Avarice, Scorn, Oppression, Selfishness, and
others—thousands of nests in the hearts both of Jews and Christians.
Well, suppose you have the power of looking into their hearts, as
though they were so many crystal hives, suppose you behold in
them the rapacious insects—hear their buzzing—almost see their
stings, if you cry “Wasps, wasps,” men will shake their heads at yon
for a malicious, evil-minded fellow ; but, my dear boy, clap your
hands, and cry, “What a honeycomb l’” and you shall pass from
mouth to mouth as the “best of creatures.” When you have seen
something more of the world, you will know that men rarely attri-
bute an exposure of a social evil to an inherent indignation at the
evil itself, but to an unhealthy appetite for moral foulness. Then,
my boy, will they most virtuously defame you—then will they, in
the name of outraged virtue, call you hard, high-sounding names.
The wrestlers of old, says Plutarch, threw dirt on one another that
they might get a better grasp, and more successfully trip up each

name of virtue, cast dirt upon him who would trip up a giant wrong.
There were, doubtless, those among the Philistines—particular and
most virtuous friends of Goliah—who called David a very bitter, ill-
natured little fellow.
It is extraordinary, too, how this scandal will stick upon you ; how
it will be used to misinterpret all your motives—to give a twist to your
most heroic, most benevolent actions. I will suppose that you are
crossing a bridge, or walking by the river's side. Well, a nursery-
maid—thinking, it may be, of Jack Robinson, whom she is to meet
when the child is put to bed—is so far buried in her thoughts that
she lets the baby tumble souse into the stream. Well, although you
may not swim like a dolphin, without waiting to take off your coat,
or lay your gold repeater on the grass, you leap into the water, and
with no small personal risk manage to bring the baby safe to the
bank. Well, you think yourself entitled to at least the good opinion
of the world for your heroism. Alas ! you have been such a bitter
person all your life, you have told such disagreeable verities, you
have so constantly refused to club in with that conventional hypocrisy
that has neither eyes nor nose for social blotch or social taint, that
Detraction denies to you one word of praise for your ducking; but
gravely insists that your sole reason for jumping into the river was
this, you thought you saw a silver spoon shining at the bottom.
Having obtained a name for ill-nature, or in reality having ac-
quired a fatal reputation for using your eyes, it will be in vain for
you to deal in praise of anything. No : the people who profess to
know you will, like witches, read even your prayers backwards; will
insist that there is some lurking mischief, some subtle abuse, in what
appears to be unmixed and heartfelt eulogy. Offer what you will to
the world, the world will declare you only deal in one commodity.
You will be in the condition of the man who sold lemons. His history
being very short, and at the same time touchingly illustrative of the
cvil I would warn you against, shall be set down in this letter.
There was, in a certain city, a man who sold lemons. From boy-
hood until forty, he had dealt in no other fruit; and with those who
needed lemons, his stock was in good request. And so years passed
away, and the man made a tolerable living of his merchandize,
through a certain bluntness of manner, a resolution never to take
one farthing less of a customer than he first asked, did somewhat
keep down the profits of his calling. Throughout the city, the man
was known by no other title than—the Lemon Merchant. At length,
but how it came to pass I know not, lemons ceased to be in demand :
no man, woman, or child, purchased a lemon—lemons seemed, hence-
forth, to be the forbidden fruit: crowds of passengers passed the
man's basket, but no one spent a single obolus. Want, starvation,
threatened our lemon-merchant. What was he to do It was plain
the fashion had turned from lemons, and had set in for nothing
but oranges. Well, my son, you would think it was some good genius
that whispered to the man, “Give up thy lemon basket; do not
vainly strive to huckster with what is now the accursed fruit, but sell
what little goods thou hast, and hieing to the market, there buy thee
oranges; sweet, delicious oranges ; oranges, luscious as the flesh of
Venus.” The lemon-merchant followed the advice of his counsellor,
and selling up all he had in the world, invested the money in a box
of magnificent oranges: they were the finest in the market; the
mouths of emperors might have watered for them; they were a glad-
dening picture to the eye—a restorative perfume to the nose. Since
the oranges that wooed the lip of Eve in Paradise, there never had
been such oranges 1
It was a grand holiday, when for the first time our henceforth
orange-merchant took his customary stand at the steps of the Church
of St. Angelica. His eye twinkled and his heart swelled with honest
pride as he looked at the passengers who thronged by him, and then
again looked at the golden fruit piled in his basket at his foot. It
was very strange; but though all the orange-dealers about him sold

their stock in a trice—although he was left with the only oranges near
the church, no one, albeit seeking oranges, offered to buy of him. At
last, the man took heart, and cried to the people as they passed,
“Oranges; sweet, sweet oranges 1 Buy my oranges . "
“Oranges, fellow !” cried the passengers, “what impudence is this
Isn't it clear that there isn't an orange in your basket—isn't it cer-
tain that you deal in nothing but lemons f"
It was in vain for the man to bawl “Oranges 1" for there was no
one who heard him, who did not laugh and sneer, and answer,
“Pooh pooh Lemons !”
My dear son, once get a reputation (as you have done with Alder-
man Bilberry) for the acidity of truth, and though your lips, like the
lips of the infant Plato, shall distil honey, the world will not believe
in the sweetness. Offer what oranges you will, the world will repay
the offering with the cry of—“Lemons.”
A NEW DISCOVERY.
Who has not heard of the Clerk of the Weather, and who has not
wondered where that influential personage resided ?
medes, somewhere or the other, confesses himself puzzled to settle
his whereabout ; and the elder Pliny offered a thousand drachmae to
any one who would furnish him with the address of this—elder
Murphy. It was reserved for PUNCH to enlighten the world upon
this most important subject. Let the “listening millions” who have
for centuries stood with their auriculars erect to learn this wondrous
secret, pour forth a paean to our illustrious self, as we announce that
the Clerk of the Weather is no other than
THE PROPRIETOR OF WAUXHALL.

us strongly of the original—with whom we had the honour of smoking

NATURAL AND NATIONAL.
It has been said that her Majesty intends to visit Edinburgh once a
year for the future. We have no faith in this rumour, which, we believe,
originates in the fact that any one who visits the modern Athens is at
once seized with a tremendous itching for going to Scotland.
Since the apprehension of O'Connor and his fellow demagogues, to so high a pitch is

COLD-WATER, CURING SOCIETY.
A NUMERous meeting of licensed victuallers, free vintners, brewers
and distillers, took place on Michaelmas day, at the George-House
Tavern, to form the above Society upon benevolent principles—
Alderman Bacchus in the chair.
After the usual preliminaries were over, the Chairman rose to ex-
plain the objects of the meeting. They had assembled, he said, to
combine their energies for the promotion of a great national object—
that of staying the frightful ravages which were daily being made upon
the British constitution, by the insane use of a beverage which he
could never name without a blush of indignation—he, of course,
meant water. (Hear, hear.) The large, influential, and respectable
meeting before him—(Loud cheers)—appeared there in self-defence; for
though there are societies in existence, which had they done their
duty, might have checked this evil they had met to suppress—and
would, by the blessing of Heaven, eventually totally abolish—yet
they had, in this instance, wholly neglected their trust. He confessed
he attributed great blame to the Society for the Suppression of Vice:
they had positively done nothing to put down the unnatural vice of
water-drinking. But it was that for the Suppression of Cruelty to
Animals, which, in his humble opinion, deserved the greatest share
of blame. A donkey with a well-established raw, a horse with a
rubbed shoulder met with their tenderest sympathies; but what had
they done for the benefit of the noblest of all animals—man What
had they effected against that inhuman mania which threatens to
sweep away in one weak, washy, everlasting flood, the manly, ener-
getic, courageous character which hitherto belonged to Englishment
—Nothing. (Indignant cries of “Shame.”) No, the task was left to the
present meeting, and he, the chairman, knew they would perform it
nobly and patriotically. The worthy alderman sat down amidst long-
continued cheering.
MAL'ſ on HoPs, Esq., of the Giant Brewhouse, proposed the first
resolution. He quite agreed with all that had fallen from the worthy
chairman. Unless the public could be inoculated with a rabid hydro-
phobia, with a strong dread of water, England would soon sink in
the scale of nations, in spite of Sir Felix Booth and the Income-tax.
He was quite sure that water was never intended to be drank neat—
he could prove it : if it were, why was barley sent to us? why were
we blest with materials for mixing! Let the most deluded hydropathist
answer—he defied him 1 (Hear.) Water was an excellent thing in its
way; as an ingredient in brewing, or in making Punch, he (Malton
Hops, Esquire), did not object to it—neither is it an unpleasant
adulterate of good brandy—but in its raw, crude, natural state, no-
thing could be more pernicious or nauseating. In conclusion, the
eminent brewer moved, that, as their efforts were to be directed to
curing the public of the disgusting use of cold water, the Society
should take the name of the “Cold Water Curing Association.”
MR. TENston E, of the “Baron of Beef,” seconded the motion.
MR. JUNIPER proposed the second resolution. He feared that
nothing short of legislative interference could strangle the Hydra
which devoured the vitals of the public 1 (Loud cheers.) He would
petition parliament. He would double the tax on water—abolish
pumps—put down wells—stop water-works. He was for no half
measures. They (the distillers, brewers, and publicans), ought to be
the only purveyors of water to a misguided public. In that case the
article would be supplied in a wholesome and drinkable state, pro-
perly combined with less injurious ingredients.
MR. BRANDYRLosso M was happy to second the motion, but he
could not go quite the length of the last speaker. Parliamentary in-
terference was unnecessary. The present society might do all that
was required unassisted. In the first place let them put down tem-
perance societies. (No, no, no, from sereral coices.)
MR. TAPE, of the “Blue Ruin,” Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's
would take the liberty of interrupting his honourable friend for an
instant. It was quite a mistake to suppose that Temperance So-
cieties promoted the shocking vice of water-drinking. He spoke from
experience. Those of his customers who had taken the pledge were
heart and soul in the cause they were met to advocate—namely, that
of beer, gin, and no water 1 (Hear.)
MR. BRANDY Blosso M was always glad to be set right. Well, then,
let them encourage Temperance Societies 1 (Hear, hear, hear, from all
parts of the room.) He had another plan to propose. He was always
thankful that he lived amongst an enlightened though often a mis-
guided nation. The public had only to be thoroughly convinced of
their errors to amend them. Now, it was not sufficiently known tha
water was to all intents and purposes a slow poison I (Immensesensation.)

Gracious Powers when he (Mr. Brandyblossom) reflected how
many venomous animals swam into a man's stomach with every
draught of water he swallowed, the hair of his (Mr. Brandyblossom's)
head would, he had no hesitation in saying, stand on end—if it were
not that he was, unhappily, bald. The legions of devils—some of
them of the bluest cast—which found a home in every water-drinker's
inside quite accounted for the crowded state of our lunatic asylums |
(Deafening cheers.) Reptiles of the most loathsome forms and de-
structive activity would show their disgusting forms to strike the
vicious sucker-in of Adam's ale with pale affright, could he only be
persuaded to drink his potations out of a microscope; and this
brought him (Mr. Brandyblossom) to the gist of his second propo-
sition, which was to engage a certain number of well-tried soakers to
give lectures, all over the country, on the solar microscope. The
horrors that admirable instrument reveals would turn the stomach
of the hardiest waterman, and drive him impetuously to unnum-
bered glasses of brandy to keep his feelings down.

“Something desperate,” continued the speaker, much excited,
“must be done ! The water-works of Hydropathy are doing their
worst upon us. The waters are fast gathering around us—the deluge
threatened by Pressnitz and Claridge will be more overwhelming
than that of Noah or Deucalion—it will be a moral deluge, washing
away our brains, cooling and thinning our blood, and sweeping the
very decanters from our sideboards. But fortunately, drowning as
we are, there is something more than a straw to catch at. Yes, I
say it with triumphant confidence—missionaries and microscopes
will be our salvation 1" (Enthusiastic cheers.)
A subscription was immediately entered into to carry the last
speaker's proposition into effect, and enough was speedily collected
to fit out one missionary with a complete apparatus.
The chairman having most handsomely stood glasses round, the
meeting separated.
THAMES GAZETTE AND RIVER CHRONICLE.
Two old barges on the Thames have been raised to the Peerage by the
titles of Lambeth and Blackfriars... The latter takes the second title of
Barren of Paint.
Several Watermen have been promoted to the rank of Captain ; and
Jack-in-the-Water is to be Mate, without purchase, vice Gibbins, who is

There was a desperate affray with smugglers, last week, off the racks at
Chelsea. Two men endeavoured to run ashore at the Old Swan Pier,
when the pass was demanded; and in the scuffle a cigar fell from the hand
of one of them, which led to a suspicion that everything about them was
contraband. A general affray was commenced, in which the preventive-
man—who takes the checks—was much harassed. The suspected
smugglers were at length secured, and taxed with having in their posses-
sion a cargo of rum, which on a search being made was found to consist
of several copies of “Punch,” which were being imported for Chelsea
consumption
THE WESTED RIGHTS OF DEATH !
THE Times of the past week contains a most affecting and heart-
stirring appeal (in the way of advertisement) “to the Rectors, Vicars,
and Incumbents of England, the proprietors of vaults; also, to the
Parish Clerks and Sextons, &c., of the Burial Grounds in England 1”
This address issueth from the office of “Fitch and Son, 17, Union-
street, Southwark,” those champions of the metropolitan interred.
They say—and we can easily imagine the big tears rolling down
their cheeks as they sob forth the syllables—
“Gentlemen —Your attention should be particularly directed to a BILL intro-
duced into Parliament last Session for the benefit of the proprietors of the new
cemeteries, but under the plausible title of “A Bill for the Improvement of the
Health of Towns, and which, if passed into a law in its present shape, will be one
of the greatest attacks on private property that was ever known, and the greatest
outrage on the feelings of human nature, by closing those time-hallowed spots where
our forefathers have rested for centuries.”
This desecrating bill enacts—
“That from and after the 31st day of December, 184—, no burial or interment of
any dead body shall take place in or within the distance of two miles from the pre-
cincts or boundaries of the cities of London or Westminster, or the borough of
Southwark, or within one mile of any other city, town, or borough, in England,”
&c. &c.
Now, if this bill pass, will it not peril the fees—the burial fees—
of Messrs. the Rectors, Vicars, Incumbents, and also of Parish
Clerks and Sextons ! Do we not hear the Death's Head, at No. 17,
Union-street, Southwark, crying, with truly sepulchral voice—
“Fees 1—fees t—fees?”
The MAN FOR MY Money.
Not but what we give Messrs. Fitch and Son credit for higher, for
more solemn motives. They doubtless feel that the “time-hallowed”
custom of burying the dead among the living, keeps a perpetual
lesson of mortality before otherwise unthinking man. Besides, when
seated in our pews, the preacher saith—“I hare said to corruption, thou art
my father: to the worm, thou art my mother and my sister,”—are not our reli-
gious sympathies wondrously quickened by the charnel-house effluvia
reeking from the vaults below Do we not arrive at a closer affinity
to corruption, when another sense is appealed to from many things
around us? And then, what perpetual mementoes are tombstones
erected in the highway of London life . How do their solemn
enunciations smite the breast of mere money-getting selfishness
How many an attorney, perched on the outside of an omnibus, as
the vehicle lingered by a London church-yard, has caught an
assurance that he was only a son of dust, a thing of worms, that
might be stark to-morrow ; and, touched by such assurance, how has
he refused to do the harsh bidding of some reckless client, and has
wrought an amicable and all but costless arrangement between
creditor and debtor ; when, had no tombstone stood in his path
'twixt Brompton and the Bank, he had never thought of his dust—
had had no suspicion that by any possibility he could die to-morrow !
We are convinced of it, it is for the precious sake of these
humanising influences, that Messrs. Fitch and Son appeal to “Rec-
tors, Vicars,” &c.—and no—not for fees |
THE ELECTION FOR LORD MAYOR.
THE Alderman next on the list for the office of Lord Mayor, has been
passed over on the ground of his not having a fortune sufficiently large to
keep up the dignity of the City's chief magistrate. It is evident that a
Lord Mayor is now looked upon generally as so rich a treat, that anything
like a suspicion of poverty is considered a fit ground of exclusion from the
office. It would seem, that a candidate for the mayoralty is chosen, not
for his deserts, but his dinners.
THE LINEN TRADE.
TheRE have been a few transactions in rags at three-pence a pound,
and an extensive bone-grubber caused considerable excitement by bring:
ing a quantity of waste-paper into the market which turned the scale in
his own favour.

My movements are graceful—my actions are free;
I turn where I wist—now I'm in—now I'm out;
But who can predict where to-morrow I'll be P
I'm the flirt of the garden. One moment I press
In my delicate tendrils the Sunflower's stem ;
Then I hold the young Lily in ardent caress:
To me it is sport— though 'tis bondage to them.
The Jasmine will often with ardour entwine
Round the trellis to which they have coax'd it to cling;
But, ah I to fall off it will ever incline,
Unless its ºttachment is guided—by string.
VENEtiaN blind.
Aud thus it is ever with many a flower—
Unless they have train'd it, its constancy fails;
It coldly drops off from the desolate bower,
Unless they've resorted to hammer and nails.
Oh, they cannot the playful Convolvolus charge
With conduct so cold and so heartless as this ;
Though embracing the belles of the garden at large,
'Tis constant where once ’t has imprinted its kiss.
For e'en though its victim should languish and die,
The Convolvolus still to the ruin is true:
Where once ’tis entwined it continues to lie,
Till decay shall have reach'd the Convolvolus tcol
“CONSCIENCE MONEY.”
In the Times of two or three days ago, may be read these startling
words:—
“The Chancellor of the Exchequer acknowledges the receipt of the sum of *400,
conscience money, from an individual signing himself “Aliquis.”
We would give—yes, the two volumes of Punch—to have half-an-
hour's chat with “Aliquis.” Who, of the modern sneerers, shall after
this say conscience is not thought much of in these days, seeing that a
man renders back the sum of £400 for it ! We have a great mind to
attempt an imaginary life of “Aliquis.” Was he a smuggler If
so, most ignorant has been his compunction, all writers on free trade
holding the greatest smuggler to be the greatest benefactor to his
country. Is he a retired M.P., who—having touched the public
money for what, in the new wisdom of his heart, he now deems cor-
rupt practices—would make a clean pocket of it? Is he a superan-
nuated actor, smitten with a sense of undeserved genius This is
by no means an improbable case. We can believe that Mr. CHARLEs
KEAN, for instance, will, when “years shall bring the philosophic
mind,” send a very considerable amount of “conscience-money” to a
future Chancellor, in atonement of the large subsidies he has levied
upon his fellow-subjects. This we know–if he would die easily, he
ought.
Would that Conscience could be universal in its touch upon the
breeches' pockets of the rich and well-to-do Great would be its
subscriptions to the State—great its tardy justice to the wants and
injuries of others If Conscience, by its ten thousand emissaries,
would peep between the bed-curtains of the placeman, the sinecurist,
the o'er-fatted bishop, the Croesus of costs, the lawyer, and with un-
ceasing voice bid each social evil-doer, each snug brigand, render
back his misbegotten earnings to the poor, Sir Robert Peel might
dispense with his Income tax, and twenty other taxes into the
bargain.

OBJECTS OF ART IN THE METROPOLIS.
No. 3.--THE Boccius Light.
NTERPRISE has tri-
umphed. After much trou-
ble we have discovered that
the “Modern Sphinx” “ is
nothing more nor less than
V-- the Boccius light. It is not
the light itself that is the
immediatedbject of the pre-
sent article to immortalise,
-—but it is our aim to give to
the public some faint idea
of the magnificent archi-
tectural structure that the
Boccius is mounted on.
From four common street posts, there run perpendicularly to the
height of about four feet no less than four pieces of straight wood, after
the fashion of the well-known uprights in d. Temple of Jupiter Gammon
at Trinchinopoli. Here the architect seems to have abandoned the severe
and got into the playful style, for he has skilfully arched four iron crow
bars, which meet in a rosette of tin at the top, which is elaborately ara-
besqued into the shape of a coronet. This tasteful tribute to the peerage,
placed as it is exactly opposite Northumberland House, and almost flush
with the Lion's Tail looking in a slanting direction from the North, with
your face towards the sky, does infinite credit to the vigorous imagina-
tion of the architect. The great post in the centre is framed partly
on the model of a cannon taken from the French in one of the Duke's
peninsular campaigns, while the upper part is designed on the plan of
something between the modern walking-stick and the ancient javelin.
The ground beneath is paved in a circular form, but it is an open ques-
tion whether the idea of making it perfectly round was suggested by a
wooden hoop or the moon, both of which were equally accessible to the
apprehension of the architect.
It is to be regretted that the art of painting has not been laid under
contribution, to add its attractions to this pleasing triumph of architectural
skill; but we must freely confess, that the single coat of salmon-colour
which at present is all that the brush has done for the Boccius, is what
our Gallic neighbours would call mesquin, but to which the old British
epithet of shabby, would be more appropriate.
Taken as a whole, the light and its architectural accompaniments do
credit to the public spirit of the nation in general, and the rate-payers of
St. Martin's may point to it with pride, as a proof of what may be done
by the mere energy requisite for doing it.
A SONG.
writt EN AT THIRTY-NINE, by M.R. wakley.
O what was it made me in boyhood so gay,
Though the cash of to-day could not last till to-morrow?
What was it that turn'd ev’ry night into day,
And extracted a balm out of subjects for sorrow?
O was it the tremor that followed each lie–
(That “I ever was out” was unknown to my mother)—
That cheer'd up my “parlour, the next from the sky,”
Where I drank through one quarter, and cramm'd through the other?
O was it the pilot coat, mark'd ten and-six,
In which in the station-house often I've rolled !
Or was it the goss that I'd jauntily fix
The more on one side, as the more it got old?
O was it the half-and-half found in the pot?
Or the balls that so merrily roll'd o'er the baize?
That makes even Bow-street a hallowed spot,
And lights up with sunshine my hospital days.
AN ESCAPE FROM NEWGATE.
It was rumoured last week that there had been an Escape at Newgate.
The civic authorities were immediately on the alert, and the sheriffs
repaired in the greatest haste to the prison. On making inquiries, our
own reporter discovered that there really had been an escape, at six
o'clock in the morning, when one of the turnkeys, to use his own expres-
sion, “smelt something wrong.” It turned out that there really had been
an escape, from the lower ward—of gast

THE STATISTICAL SOCIETY
Has been occupied for some time past with their usual diverting
indefatigability in a discussion as to What becomes of all the umbrellas !
It appears, upon an average, that, in bad weather, one umbrella in
every three is left behind by the owner at some spot never recol-
lected. Eleven persons out of twelve who borrow umbrellas on wet
nights never think of returning them ; and out of this said eleven,
seven lose the safeguards thus kindly lent them by their friends,
which finally come out after dusk, on other wet nights, at a shilling
a-piece in Leicester-square and Tottenham Court Road. It is calcu-
lated, that if all the lost cotton umbrellas could be got together, a
tarpaulin would be formed, in the shape of a vast dome, sufficient to
roof-in Vauxhall Gardens, and thus give the Royal property (so called
from never having been the least use to anybody else) an ultimate
chance of succeeding. The silk ones, rendered air-tight by varnish,
would form a balloon, capable of landing a thousand troops in China in
24 hours. The direction of the wind would be of little consequence,
as the balloon could either go over Europe, or circumvent the
brothers of the Moon by the North American line of clouds. By
this means, although the Chinese are up to various kinds of peculiarly
cunning dodges, we could be down upon them at once, in the most
conclusive manner. It is worthy the attention of Government.
THE GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY
Has been chiefly occupied in arranging an expedition to discover
the beginning and end of Marylebone-lane—a point, we believe, never
yet made known. Their researches at present prove that the
thoroughfare in question runs in the direction of every point of the
compass, and that it is presumed to go from the neighbourhood of
the New Road to some point in the city not yet ascertained.
They have also discovered, that the singular optical delusion in
going down the river below Greenwich, which gives the large ships
the appearance of sailing in the fields and gardens behind the various
houses on the banks, is owing to the convolutions of the Thames,
which twists about here like a lobworm with the colic.

SIR Robert PEEL and the Earl of Liverpool are stated to have had good

JUVENILE BIOGRAPHY.
No, I-LITTLE JACK HORNER.
In searching through the enormous mass of materials which were
soon placed at our disposal when it was understood in literary circles
that we were about to write a biography of this illustrious youth,
we were struck by nothing so much as by the utter want of connection
between the rich resources thus placed within our reach, and the
renowned individual of whom we have resolved to furnish the world
with a history. Scarcely had our intentions been intimated in those
brilliant coteries of wit and learning, at which a second Boswell
might find half-a-dozen Johnsons, and reap a harvest of lettered
chaff—scarcely had the secret been breathed in those dazzling
reunions where the lightning of wit plays round the conductor of
genius, or forks itself out at the expense of all around,-scarcely, we
say, had the secret become known, than it was universally spread
about, and the whisper of the initiated few was echoed in the shout
of the multitude. It was then that the name of Horner was regarded
as a passport to fame, and each who could boast of bearing it came
forward with family records purporting to throw a light upon the his-
tory of their alleged ancestor; and many a wealthy burgher, who
would have left “little Jack” to eat his “Christmas pie” in silence
and solitude, crouching in that corner to which, by the neglect of
those around him, he was in his lifetime doomed,—many, we repeat,
of those “heartless parasites of present cheer” crowded our study,
and assailed our bell (the third from the bottom), for the purpose of
claiming kindred with the boy, to whom we were about to award
immortality in the form of a biography. But it is ever thus, -and,
as the seven cities which refused to Homer the coarse crust of
charity, contended after his death for the honour of giving him birth,
so have the Horners of modern times come forward to claim relation-
ship with Jack, to whom when living they would have denied an
extra piece of that pie, his devotion to which was perhaps the most
salient point of his extraordinary character.
In tracing our hero's genealogical chart, we are met at the thresh-
old by one of those difficulties which are not easily overcome, for
history has been altogether silent on the question of his parentage.
That the Horners of Hampshire came over with the Saxons, and
shared the fortunes of Cedric in his hazardous adventures, is at least
a matter of doubt; and, even if the fact were clear, to connect little
Jack with the Horners of Hampshire would be utterly impossible.
We know from Stowe that the Horns at Kennington are of ancient
date; but even Camden, who never allows probability to interfere
with an ingenious hypothesis, has not hazarded a conjecture that the
Horners and the Horns are the same thing, so that the two anti-
quaries leave us just as we were on the subject of our hero's family.
Rejecting, therefore, the lofty regions of surmise, let us descend to
the level of facts; for it will ever be found to hold good in the lite-
rary as in the physical world, that if we would reach a certain point
it is better to follow the road than to endeavour to mount into the
witz n things come to THE Wolts'T THEY MUst TARE A TURN.
air—at least until atmospheric railways can be adapted to the
purpose of traversing the atmosphere.
“Little Jack Horner,” says the historian who combined also the
office of a poet—a proof of the remoteness of the age in which he
lived, for it was only in an early century that the bard and the chro-
nicler were identical—“Little Jack Horner,” says the historian “sat
Vol. III.- 1842.
in a corner,” a position he seems to have retained throughout the
entire portion of his life, which forms the subject of the verse from
which we derive nearly all the knowledge we have of him.
It would appear to the superficial reader, that at the particular
moment when little Jack Horner starts upon the page of history, he
must have been undergoing punishment for some grievous offence,
since the very fact of his sitting in “a corner,” could only be the
result of an error for which he was made to undergo a not uncommon
penalty. It is true that “a corner” has, from time immemorial,
been regarded as a place of punishment for juveniles, but the
extraordinary circumstances under which we find the youthful Jack,
not only eating a Christmas pie, but taking credit for moral excel-
lence in the beautiful burst of nature that follows, must preclude ug
from supposing that his position in the corner arose from any thing
but that waywardness which is common to the young in every grade
of society.
The second line brings us to the eating of the Christmas pie; aud
we must here pause for a moment to inquire how it came to pass that
it should have been a pie, and not a pudding, which little Jack
Horner was partaking of. The period of the event is not necessarily
fixed (as some writers have erroneously presumed) by the fact that
the pie was a Christmas pie ; though we admit there is nothing to
warrant a belief to the contrary. It is, however, possible that a
Christmas pie may have been eaten in June, or, at least, on New Year's
Day; or, indeed, at any other time within the twelvemouth. The real
difficulty lies in the pie itself rather than in fixing the exact season at
which little Jack was eating it; for though it has escaped the acuºuen
of the accomplished editor of Mr. Harris's last illuminated edition of
the poem, we cannot but observe that there is, after all, no such thing
as a Christmas pie, and that Christmas pudding would have been the
reading of the schoolmen in the days when the revival of learning
had led toacorrectness of interpretation, which, if it pleased by its ex-
actness, could only offend by its severity. It is true that there is a
pie peculiar to Christmas which is distinguished by the quaint epithet
of mince; but at the early age when Horner flourished, we believe
that mince pies were wholly unknown ; or, at least, had not become
a part and parcel of our greatest annual holiday.
To go on, however, with the narrative, which we have been tempted
to overlay, with, perhaps, too much learning, for we have been un-
willing to omit an opportunity of holding the flambeau of erudition
over the page of history, and applying the snuffers of criticism to the
long-burning and extensively wicked candles of the early chroniclers.
“He put in his thumb and pull'd out a plum,”
says the bard in a burst of simple eloquence, which nothing in Froissart
can equal for its clearness; while we look in vain to the irregular
jottings of Diderot or Grimm, for any thing that can compete with its
truthful perspicuity. The character of little Jack Horner is com-
pletely developed in the line we have quoted, and that which imme-
diately follows it; nor is it without strong emotion that we denounce
him to future generations as an idle braggart, and a disgusting epi-
cure. That he was the latter no one can doubt, who views in its
proper light the gluttonous process of pulling out a plum ; and the
==H-àSTF
Board ING A MAN-OF-WArt.
former part of our accusation is borne out by the egotistical ejacula-
tion which concludes his degrading history. No one can be told that
an urchin used the vain-glorious words which form the last line of
the ballad, without feeling the truth of the verdict we have thought
proper to pass; and the mere exclamation of “What a good boy am
I!” was sufficient to write braggart on his tomb, and give him the
word “humbug” as his appropriate epitaph.
Having summed up the mental attributes of Horner, we have
nothing but his person to describe, which, from his having gained the
appellation of “Little Jack,” we may infer was rather diminutive.
His features are still preserved to us in a painting prefixed to the
edition of 1841, in the Harrisonian Library at the corner of St. Paul's
Church-yard, where it is sometimes exhibited publicly in the window,
though, we believe, there are no stated days for the exhibition, which
is entirely dependent on the caprice of the shopman.

MR. MUFFS INTRODUCTORY DISCOURSE
TO THE MEDICAL STUDENTS.
It will be perfectly useless to give any minute report of the oration
delivered by Dr. Wurzel to his pupils, because all introductory lec-
tures, at whatever school they may be given, always end in the same
thing, viz., persuading as many students to enter to the classes as
can be talked over. He told them that they had made choice of a
very harassing profession, in which the pleasure derived from alle-
viating the sufferings of their fellow-creatures would be far beyond
any pecuniary recompense they might expect, which of course he
mentally agreed in, as well as in the following confession, that he
and his colleagues, who formed the teachers of the school, were
actuated solely by a love of their noble calling, and no affection for
common-place coin. Moreover, he indulged his hearers with an
history of all the eminent medical men down to the present time,
from the very celebrated people who never existed except in museum
portraits and Lempriere's Dictionary. And having said all this, and
a great deal more which our reporter cannot recollect, inasmuch as
he had been fast asleep for the last half hour, the worthy professor
concluded as the clock of the hospital struck three, to the great
relief of his audience. Of course there was violent applause,
although, generally speaking, medical students are quiet young men,
averse to anything like noise ; and then a violent rush took place to
the dissecting-room.
When they had collected therein, Mr. Muff sent Randall round
with the top of an earthenware jar, to collect filthy lucre for half-
MAK1 NG A Louie LE change,
and-half; and then, having publicly announced his intention of say-
ing a few words to the new students, he commenced as follows:—
“Gentlemen l’”
“Don’t call names,” interrupted Manhug.
“Order 1" bawled out Mr. Rapp, thumping the table with a stick
which he snatched from a new man standing near him, until a glass
preparation-jar danced off upon the ground, and broke to pieces, when
it was immediately concealed in the flue of the fire-place. “Order
and hear Mr. Muff.”
“Gentlemen,” continued our friend, by no means disconcerted,
“you have heard a very vivacious discourse from Dr. Wurzel, in
which he told you all he thought necessary for you to attend to, in
your wish to become leading members of the agreeable and not-by-
any-means-over-done-by-numbers profession you have decided upon
choosing. Now, I have to beg you will forget everything he said,
and listen to me; for I am about to tell you what will be of a great
deal of use to you in your future career. Jack Randall, be good
enough to poke the fire, put on the leg of a stool to make a cheerful
blaze, and pass the fermented.”
These orders being obeyed, Mr. Muff continued.
“The knowledge you will gain, gentlemen, during your studies, will
be useful, inasmuch as it will enable you to pass the hall and college;
but these points once achieved, you will be anxious to forget all you
have learned as soon as you can. Your grand study must then be
human-nature, and the habits of society. Be assured that at all times a
ready tact and a good address will bear down all the opposition that
can ever be offered in the shape of professional knowledge and
hardly-earned experience. You will do well to take a few private
lessons of the nearest undertaker in the necessary art of fixing your
looks and assuming a grave demeanour; and your spare half-hours
may be well passed in learning the most abstruse names of the most
uncommon diseases; by the display of which you will flabbergaster
other practitioners whom you may be, from time to time, called upon
to meet in consultation. Leave vulgar common-place affairs, like
measles, hooping-cough, croup, and colic, to monthly nurses and small
apothecaries; but when you have once written a treatise on the ex-
hibition and beneficial effects of Sesquicarburet of Sawdust in the
early stages of Megalanthropogenesia, be assured your fame will soon
extend. Gentlemen, I beg a moment's pause in order that I may in-
dulge in a modest drain of the commingled, to wash down that last
hard word.”
The example set by the lecturer was speedily followed by his
hearers, and when he had recovered his breath, after a protracted
deglutition, Mr. Muff went on again.
“You will find depreciation of brother practitioners of immense
service, but this must be carefully done, to avoid ever being found
out. When you are shown their prescriptions, shake your head, and
order something else; which take care to make of a different colour
and taste. In the great world, the term making one's fortune, implies
ruining somebody else's ; and, as we all attain eminence by clamber-
ing over one another's shoulders, do all you can to push down those
above you, for stepping-stones. An illustration of this theory may
be seen in the Chinese collection at Hyde-Park Corner, only it is
half-a-crown to go in. Wait until it comes to a shilling, and then
imbibe the philosophy there taught. There is a picture of a duck-
boat, and we are told that the ducks are called in every night in an
incredibly short space of time, hustling over one another like the
pittites of a theatre on grand nights. This race for superiority is
rendered thus animating, because the last bird who goes in is always
beaten by the owner. My beloved bricks, recollect that the world
is a large poultry-boat, and be careful, even to cracking your fibres
and heart-strings with exertion, never to be the last duck / Should this
happen, the beating will probably maim you, and you will never be
able to recover your lost position.
“I shall now bid you adieu until next week, when I propose to
continue this important subject.”
RATIFICATION OF THE GREAT TREATY.
We are happy to be able to announce, by an express which left the dis-
trict half an hour in advance of the overland omnibus, that the great
boundary question between the authorities of Brompton and Chelsea is at
last satisfactorily settled. Chelsea cedes the whole of the kerb stone on
the southern frontiers of Sloane-street, and by reviving an old convention
with the Hans-place authorities, it returns to the full enjoyment of the
Hanseatic districts. Brompton, on the other side, sacrifices the extensive
range of levels lying between Knightsbridge and Brompton-square; but
the Chelsea flats, beginning at ## north latitude from the Observatory on
the roof of the County Fire-off-ce, are to maintain their independent
character. It is mutually agreed that the beadle's staff on both frontiers
is to be reduced one inch in thickness and six inches in length ; and the
cab-stand, which has caused so many heart-burnings, is to be attended by
a permanent waterman, who is to be appointed alternately by the two
governments.
Brompton has magnanimously relinquished the spout and body of the
pump; but, with a reluctant fondness that is hardly blameable, still keeps
its grasp upon the handle. The swamp in front of the watch-house is to
continue neutral ground, and the boundaries are to be beaten four times a
year in the usual manner.
It will be seen from the above sketch of the principal contents of the
treaty, that the right of search is still left untouched, and it is intended to
leave it, for the present, in the hands of the bone-grubbers, who are most
interested in its exercise. The right of visit is to be taken from the
Chelsea Apothecaries, and given, under restrictions to the Brompton Sur-
geons, who have undertaken to exhibit the usual red signal with a bottle
placed in front of a lamp, which is shown in cases of reilway slaughter,
between which, and a regular surgical operation, there is very little
difference.
A BULLETIN.
A FIRE broke out in the property-apartment at Sadler's Wells Theatre ;
and though not much mischief was done, the fire must have been very bad
while it lasted, for the papers say that it was confined to the room. It is
to be presumed that upon finding itself better it went out, which was ex-
tremely fortunate.
HESSE-CASSEL, V. BABYLON 1
The Elector of Hesse-Cassel—magnanimous potentate l—would not
suffer Spohr to visit Norwich, to preside at the performance of his Fall
of Babylon. The Elector has, with proper spirit, followed up this measure
with a decree that, upon pain of death, no nightingale is to listen to its
own music within his vast dominions.

PUNCH2S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER XII.-ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF BORROWING.-HOPKINS'S
UMBRELLA.
You ask me to supply you with a list of books, that you may pur-
chase the same for your private delectation. My dear boy, receive
this, and treasure it for a truth: no wise man ever purchases a book.
Fools buy books, and wise men—borrow them. By respecting, and
acting upon this axiom, you may obtain a very handsome library for
nothing.
Do * not perceive, too, that by merely borrowing a volume at
every possible opportunity, you are obtaining for yourself the reputa-
tion of a reading man; you are interesting in your studies dozens of
people who, otherwise, would care not whether you knew A, B, C,
or not With your shelves thronged with borrowed volumes, you
have an assurance that your hours of literary meditation frequently
engage the thoughts of, alike, intimate and casual acquaintance. To
be a good borrower of books is to get a sort of halo of learning about
you not to be obtained by laying out money upon printed wisdom.
For instance, you meet Huggins. He no sooner sees you than, pop,
you are associated with all the Caesars; he having—simple Huggins !
—lent you his Roman History bound in best historic calf. He never
beholds you but he thinks of Romulus and Remus, the Tarpeian
Rock, the Rape of the Sabines, and ten thousand other interesting
and pleasurable events. Thus, you are doing a positive good to Hug-
gins by continually refreshing his mind with the studies of his
thoughtful youth; whilst, as I say, your appearance, your memory, is
associated and embalmed by him with things that “will not die.”
Consider the advantage of this. To one man you walk as Hamlet;
why? you have upon your shelves that man's best edition of Shak-
spere. To another, you come as the archangel Michael. His illustrated
Paradise Lost glitters amongst your borrowings. To this man, by
the like magic, you are Robinson Crusoe; to this, Telemachus. I
will not multiply instances: they must suggest themselves. Be sure,
however, on stumbling upon what seems a rare and curious volume,
to lay your borrowing hands upon it. The book may be Sanscrit,
Coptic, Chinese: you may not understand a single letter of it; for
which reason, be more sternly resolved to carry it away with you.
The very act of borrowing such a mysterious volume implies that you
are in some respects a deep fellow—invests you with a certain
literary dignity in the eyes of the lending. Besides, if you know not
Sanscrit at the time you borrow, you may before you die. You
cannot promise yourself what you shall not learn ; or, having bor-
rowed the book, what you shall not forget.
There are three things that no man but a fool lends—or having lent,
is not in the most hopeless state of mental crassitude if he ever hope
to get back again. These three things, my son, are—Books, UM-
BRELLAs, and Mon EY I believe, a certain fiction of the land
assumes a remedy to the borrower; but I know no case in which any
man, being sufficiently dastard to gibbet his reputation as plaintiff in
such a suit, ever fairly succeeded against the wholesome prejudices of
society.
In the first place, books being themselves but a combination of
borrowed things, are not to be considered as vesting even their
authors with property. The best man who writes a book, borrows
his materials from the world about him, and therefore, as the phrase
goos, cannot come into court with clean hands. Such is the opinion
of some of our wisest law-makers; who, therefore, give to the
mechanist of a mouse-trap, a more lasting property in his invention
than if he had made an Iliad. And why? The mouse-trap is of
wood and iron : trees, though springing from the earth, are property;
iron, dug from the bowels of the earth, is property: you can feel it,
hammer it, weigh it: but what is called literary genius is a thing not
ponderable, an essence (if, indeed, it be an essence) you can make
nothing of, though put into an air-pump. The mast, that falls from
beech, to fatten hogs, is property; as the forest laws will speedily
let you know, if you send in an alien pig to feed upon it: but it has
been held, by wise, grave men in Parliament, that what falls from
human brains to feed human souls, is no property whatever. Hence,
private advantage counsels you to borrow all the books you can ;
whilst public opinion abundantly justified you in never returning
them.
I have now to speak of UMBRELLAs. Would you, my son, from
what you have read of Arab hospitality—would you think of counting
out so many penny-pieces, and laying them in the hand of your Arab
host, in return for the dates and camel's milk that, when fainting,
dying, with thirst, hunger and fatigue, he hastened to bestow upon
'you ? Would you, I say, chink the copper coin in the man's ear, in
return for this kindly office, which the son of the desert thinks an
“instrumental part of his religion ?” If, with an ignorance of the
proper usages of society, you would insult that high-souled Arab by
any tender of money, then, my son—but no I think you incapable
of the sordidness of such an act, then would you return a Borrowed
Umbrella 1
Consider it. What is an umbrella but a tent that a man carries
about with him—in China, to guard him from the sun, -in England,
to shelter him from the rain Well, to return such a portable
tent to the hospitable soul who lent it, what is it but to offer the
Arab payment for shelter; what is it but to chaffer with magnani-
mity, to reduce its greatness to a mercenary lodging-house keeper ?
Umbrellas may be “hedged about” by cobweb statutes; I will not
swear it is not so; there may exist laws that make such things pro-
perty; but sure I am that the hissing contempt, the loud-mouthed
indignation of all civilized society, would sibilate and roar at the
bloodless poltroon, who should engage law on his side to obtain for
him the restitution of a-lent umbrella 1
We now come to—Money. I have had, in my time, so little of it,
that I am not very well informed on monetary history. I think, how-
ever, that the first Roman coin was impressed with a sheep. A
touching and significant symbol, crying aloud to all men, “Children,
fleece one another.” My son, it is true, that the sheep has vanished
from all coin : nevertheless, it is good to respect ancient symbols:
therefore, whatever the gold or silver may bear—whatever the
potentate, whatever the arms upon the obverse, see with your ima-
ginative eye nothing but the sheep; listen with your fancy's ear to
nought but—“fleece”—“fleece 1"
I am aware, that a prejudice exists amongst the half-educated, that
borrowed money is as money obtained by nothing; that, in fact, it is
not your own ; but is only trusted in your hands for such and such a
time. My son, beware of this prejudice : for it is the fruit of the
vilest ignorance. On the contrary, look upon all borrowed money, as
money dearly, richly earned by your ingenuity in obtaining it. Put
it to your account as the wages of your intellect, your address, your
reasoning or seductive powers. Let this truth, my son, be engraven
upon your very brain-pan. To borrow money is the very highest
employment of the human intellect: to pay it back again, is to show
yourself a traitor to the genius that has successfully worked within
you.
You may, however, wish to know how to put off your creditor—
how to dumbfound him, should the idiot be clamorous. One answer
will serve for books, umbrellas, and money. As for books, by the
way, you may always have left them in a hackney-coach. (This fre-
quent accident of book-borrowers, doubtless, accounts for the literary
turn of most hackney-coachmen.) Still, I will supply you with one
catholic answer.
Hopkins once lent Simpson, his next-door neighbour, an umbrella.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
You will judge of the intellect of Hopkins, not so much from the act
of lending an umbrella, but from his insane endeavour to get it back
agalll.
s: poured in torrents. Hopkins had an urgent call. Hopkins
knocked at Simpson's door. “I want my umbrella.” Now Simpson
also had a call in a directly opposite way to Hopkins; and with the
borrowed umbrella in his hand, was advancing to the threshold.
“I tell you,” roared Hopkins, “I want my umbrella.”—“Can't have
it,” said Simpson, at the same time extending the machine dedicated
to Jupiter plurius. “Why, I want to go to the East-end, it rains in
torrents; what”—screamed Hopkins—“what am I to do for an um-
brella 1 *

FIDDLE-FADDLE AND CHARITY.
The following advertisement appeared the other day in the
Times:—
“New Church, in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark.—A Bazaar in
aid of the funds for the above object will be held this day at the Bridge House
Hotel, London Bridge, under the patronage of (we need not mention names). The
sale to commence at 11 o'clock.”
This announcement suggests several ideas to the thinking mind.
The first and most obvious is—that manners are moving, and style is
looking up in the city; that civilisation is brisk, and refinement at a
premium in the vicinity of the Mansion House. One is next led to
speculate on the display of Eastern magnificence which this grand
bazaar must have afforded—the “brooches, pearls, and onches”—the
watches, bracelets, feathers, and fetters of gold, which must have
bedecked the fronts, encircled the necks, adorned the bosoms, crowned
the brows, and manacled the limbs, of the plump and lovely stall-
keepers. Then the lips are involuntarily smacked at the idea of
coquetting at one and the same time with a basin of turtle and the
fair confectioner—for it cannot be supposed that on such an occasion,
and in such a neighbourhood, the Pride of Cornhill could have lacked
a representative. But these exercitations of the fancy are less profit-
able than amusing ; whereas, PUNCH has a proposition which occurred
to him from the perusal of the above notice, to submit; whose adop-
tion, he verily believes, would have doubled the proceeds of the
Bazaar in question, and will those of any other. Nay, he considers
his plan especially calculated for the more polite meridian of West-
minster.
Bazaars for purposes of charity have hitherto been conducted ex-
clusively by ladies; and business, in consequence, has been done
with gentlemen only. Now PUNch would press the shaving sex into
the service; whereby an attraction, which, up to this time, has been
offered to individuals of one gender only, would be provided for
persons of either. Let any one, during the height c. the season, take
a walk, between the hours of three and five, through the establishment
of Messrs. Swan and Edgar. Let him mark the row of elegant youths
lining the counters on one side, and the galaxy of loveliness extending
along them on the other, from Regent-street to Picadilly; and if he
be not at once illuminated as to the value of the suggestion now ad-
vanced, he must be fast asleep.
It is clear that if the young ministers in this Temple of Fashion
wore smock-frocks in lieu of their clerical costume; if they grinned
like yahoos or hyenas, instead of smiling, with mien politely sweet,
their acknowledgments to their pretty customers; and were wont to
blunder out “Aything else, Miss " in place of whispering “Is there
any other article to-day, Ma'am!” or, “Allow me, Ma'am, to tempt
you with this pattern ?” it would not be long before a “tremendous
sacrifice” would be announced in its magnificent windows.
NoNE but the BRAWE DESERVe the Fan E.
But, mainly owing to their address, its shrine is enriched from day
to day with the contributions of the rich and the noble. Now, such
being the importance of manner in an appeal to the female pocket,
what an influx of wealth into Charity's lap would be derived from the
attendance of the high-bred aristocrat at the counter of fashion-
able philanthropyl
This train of reflection set Punch to sleep—as it has, perhaps,
some of his readers. He dreamt, naturally enough, of what he had
been thinking about; but could never have dreamt (if he had re-
mained awake) the extent to which his idea was amplified. In par-
ticular, he now with astonishment perceived what an enlarged variety
of trades might, were his notion acted on, be made subsidiary to the
cause of benevolence.
He found himself (in a twofold sense) at a fancy fair. The whole
scene displayed that combination of daring imagination with exqui-
site taste which is characteristic of the exclusive circles. At a hand-
somely-carved desk, with a richly-bound embossed and illuminated
day-book, gilt-edged, before him, sat Lord Egerton Villiers, with a
gorgeously-inlaid steel pen behind his left ear, and the star of the
Order of the Garter on his breast. His Lordship's counter, which
was of black oak, and tastefully panelled with quatrefoils (that in
the centre bearing the arms of the family), was piled with small
parcels of tea and sugar, figs, prunes, raisins, and other light articles
of grocery, which were dispensed by his diminutive tiger (his Lord-
ship being short-sighted), who officiated very cleverly as shop-boy.
Sir Dudley Knatchbull, in an extremely smart blouse, with his
trusty steel by his side, had stationed himself at some singularly ele-
gant shambles, and, in faithful but refined mimicry, was delighting
the passers-by with his glibly-repeated cry, “What d'ye buy, Ma'am?
what d'ye buy " His wares consisted of delicate kidneys, dainty
sweetbreads, nice lamb chops, and the more spiritual varieties of
butchers’ meat.
The Duke of Hungerford, assisted by his eldest son, Lord Henry
Congers, did the honours at the stall of a mitigated costermonger.
His Grace's pines and melons came from his own nursery, as also did
the infant Lady Ianthe, whom the Duchess, who also accompanied
her liege lord, was carrying, in picturesque imitation of the less ex-
alted ranks, in her maternal arms.
The Honourable Sutton Tollemache was for the nonce a son of
Crispin. Emulative of the proprietors of the “Red Boots,” “Noah's
Arks,” and “National Shoe Marts,” he had caused each variety of
chaussure to be duly ticketed; as thus—“Best Sutherlands, 3s.6d.”
“Victoria Kids, 4s.”“Superior Almacks, 4s.6d.”“Cerito Bronzes, 5s.”
&c. &c.
Viscount Wemyss presided at an oyster-shop with native dignity.
Sharpe Neville, Esq., hard by, served out potatoes all hot on silver.
Colonel Beresford, his next neighbour, with half-a-dozen of his officers,
had set up as a hair-dresser ; while, opposite, a masquerade ware-
house had been established by Sir Nathan Levi.
By several of the distinguished traders much taste and judgment
were evinced in the choice of vocations. Two Right Reverend
Bishops were stationed side by side; one dealt in fancy bread, the
other condescended to play the fishmonger. The former disposed of
very nice loaves to an amount that was surprising; the other drove
as thriving a fish-trade, and his stock of soles in particular was got
rid of almost in no time.
Mr. Saunders Mackenzie, the great political economist and meta-
physician, was a fashionable cheesemonger, and sold many slices of
gammon, cut remarkably fine. His countryman, Sir Andrew Toadic,
the celebrated physician, appeared as a perfumer, and vended an
amazing deal of soap.
Mr. Serjeant Spry was a poulterer, and made much by his geese
and pigeons.
Chicken Hazar-D.
The scene, which was crowded with rank, beauty, and fashion, to
such an extent that it seemed if one could hardly move without
jostling an Earl, treading on a Countess's toe, or running against

the nose of a judge, was one of extreme hilarity, owing, principally,
to its somewhat masquerade-like character.
“What is the price of those muslins, my Lord?” demanded Miss
Arlington of Lord Powerscroft.
“Eighteen and six,” replied his Lordship, leaning with his thumbs
oad forefingers on the counter as naturally as if he had been a
shopman.
“Oh I come, my Lord,” said the pretty flirt; “you must throw me off
the sixpence.”
“Could n’t do it, Mem,” responded the sprightly peer, “at this
establishment.”
“Captain Tyrwhitt,” said Lady Ashwood, “oblige me with that
love of a Cardinal.”
“Shall we send it for your Ladyship tº asked the gallant officer.
Other amusing proceedings were taking place here and there;
some of them rather pretty. For instance, at the young Earl
of Middeton's stall, there was Miss Fanny Leslie fitting herself with
a glove; the said Earl helping her to try it on. The Lady Clara de
Vere was engaged in a similar experiment, at the booth of Mr. Sutton
Follemache, with respect to a certain sandal; and Major Fitzgerald,
at Colonel Beresford's, was officiating coiffeur to the fascinating Lady
Janet Strathallan.
At length PUNch’s vision, as all bright things must (worse luck 1)
faded, but the impression of it will never be effaced, neither from his
mind, nor, he hopes, from his country's. The church may want
more fancy fairs for its support, and we know that the lower classes
are occasionally rather short of the necessaries of life, which is very
unpleasant, especially in the winter. The needful subscriptions
might be raised at once, it may be said, but Charity requires a little
variety in her indulgences, which otherwise are apt to pall. Some
people, also, may maintain, that, to coax Vanity into parting with her
money by flattering her that she is Benevolence, is telling a little fib
on a side which can dispense with such assistance; but this argument
involves an unfounded insinuation. A modest exhibition of our
virtuous deeds is one thing, ostentation another. And really, if
Goodness were not sometimes to whisper “See how pretty I look l’”
she would be thought as ugly as sin. How can she look pretty
without being fashionable and how can she be fashionable without
accommodating herself to Ton? Then, Hurrah for Fiddle-faddle and
Charity

By the Observer's Correspondent.
COMING in Fort his share.
We have been favoured with a glimpse at the MS. of a sonnet by a
gentleman not as yet at all known in literary circles, though we predict
that he soon will be, if we are not very much deceived, as we sometimes
are, and indeed so may any one be, but we do not think we are, at least in
this instance, though we have had as much confidence before in other
matters, when the result has shown that we were mistaken. The new act
extending the copyright of all works to forty-two years will of course
make the descendants of a dramatic author extremely comfortable, pro-
vided he writes º that will live long enough, and be played often
enough to support his family. But this is by no means sure to happen,
for few authors in these days write anything that will be remembered
beyond a season or two; though if they can get more money, they are right;
but if they get less money, they are wrong : at least if they can do any
better, but it is probable they cannot, and whether they can or not, they
are the best judges, at least they ought to be, and if they are not, we, who
only speak for the good of all parties, would not take the responsibility of
advising them.
CITY INTELLIGENCE.
THE freedom of the City of London, and indeed of England generally,
was presented last week to Mr. Jones, on his emerging from the Fleet
n. He received it with becoming pleasure, not having enjoyed any-
thing like freedom for some months.
THE “LUXURY” OF ASSAULT.
Mon EY is the prime joy of life; the greatest blessing invented by
man for the enjoyment of his fellow. It is the one thing which im-
parts to its possessor a will of his own—which insures to him what
certain people, in their affectation of gingerly terms, call the despot-
ism of cruelty—the sovereignty of wickedness. Profound and un-
tiring have been the studies of law-makers to invest the man of
money with this high privilege; which, to the self-complacency of
the man with a purse, and to the confusion of the rogue without it,
is illustrated every day and every hour in happy, independent Eng-
land 1 Great should be the gratitude of the subject towards a govern-
ment that proffers so many sweet inducements to become a holder of
“property”—that preaches from a thousand places, and in a thousand
different accents, the surpassing loveliness of ready-money.
Reader, we will assume it for granted that you take not an un-
seemly pride in the structure of your nose—in the whiteness and
regularity of your teeth. Your nasal promontory may, in reality, be
first cousin to a note of interrogation—your teeth may be mis-shapen
straggling bits of ebony; no matter for that, it is our good pleasure
to slit your nose in twain; and for your teeth—there !—do you not
feel two of them sticking in your windpipe, and, look—there is the
third fallen on the pavement
“Shameful l’—“infamous !” cry the mob. “Here, police, take
charge of the ruffian—away with him to judgment 1” Confidently
slapping our pocket, with a somewhat gladsome trip, we hasten to
the magistrate. We are in the awful presence of justice—the whole
history of what is called “the assault” is affectingly narrated—and
great is the silent indignation of all around ; when, with one move-
ment of our hand we rebuke the mob, for we show that we have had
nothing we cannot settle for, and that, if it has pleased us to slit a
man's nose, and knock out three of his teeth, such luxury is in no
way beyond our means, for we have the money to pay for it. Henco
we calmly take out our purse, and blandly inquire of the magistrate
—“How much " Whereupon Justice weighs the mutilated nose and
extracted teeth of the complainant in her golden scales, and answers
—“So many shillings.” Well, like a gentleman, we pay for what
we have had, and, adding the inch to our height—allowed to every
man who can really pay his way—we swagger from the office.
It is true, if we had no money, we must take our seats with vulgar
paupers in her Majesty's van for Tothill-fields or Clerkenwell; but
not having committed an assault “beyond our means,” we are quite
free—if we can afford it—to begin again. Now, is this not a delight-
ful “right of property " Is not this a most exquisite philosophy of
the law of fines that makes assault purchasable —that classes
“slit noses” with pine-apples, to be duly bought by those who can
afford and have a taste for them : Is not here an inducement to ob-
tain money, when it shall award to a man full despotism over the
eyes, noses, teeth, of his fellow-countrymen Marylebone affords a
recent case of the fine privilege invested in five pounds :—
“Elizabeth Bond (a respectable female), stated that on the previous
night, as she was passing by Marylebone-lane, she was accosted by
the prisoner (William Raines, a boot and shoemaker, living in Mary-
lebone-lane,) who told her that he had been looking for her for some
time, and that having at last met with her, he would tear her liver
out and do for her; he then kicked her three times with great vio-
lence, and also struck her some severe blows. She screamed out
“Murder” as loud as she was able, and on a constable coming to her
assistance the prisoner was conveyed to the station-house.
“Mr. Rawlinson inflicted a fine of £5, and in default of payment two
months' imprisonment. The penalty was paid in the course of the
afternoon.”
William Raines has, doubtless, been imprudent. The assault in the
present case is a luxury a little beyond his means. He has very
foolishly incurred an expense only to be borne by his betters; never-
theless, as like an honest man, he has duly paid for what he has had,
there can be no ignominy, no positive shame in any transaction for
which mere money is considered an ample equivalent.
We would, however, for the convenience of those inclined to
assaults, have a table of charges published by the Magistrates, and
duly exhibited in a conspicuous place in every police-office. Thus,
no man of limited means might, so to speak, commit an assault in the
dark; but, knowing the exact cost of every injury, might first consult
his pocket, that the liveliness of his temperament should not betray
him into unexpected pecuniary difficulties
Let us, for a moment, assume a list of prices, published under
authority :-

A simple, straightforward notice like this, would enable the lovers
of assault to know what they were about. As it is, we must confess
it, they are shamefully at the mercy of the magistrates—all of whom
differ from time to time in their valuation of eyes, ribs, arms, legs,
and noses.
We have, besides this, an idea which might be profitably worked
upon. In London there are Benefit Clubs of every description : clubs
for portraits—for hats—for beds—for blankets—yea, for coffins
Now, why should there not be an “Assault Club f" It might be
called—
“THE UNITED BaoTHERs' Black EYE AND Bloony Nose Club.
Let us assume that the club shall number, say fifty members; that
the subscription shall be not higher than sixpence a-week. Well,
this gives one pound five—we will say a clear one pound per week,
deducting all expenses of officers. This sum will allow the draw-
ing of at least one handsome assault per week. Now it is hard, in-
deed, if among fifty men there should not be every seventh
day one man, at least, desirous of committing an assault upon some
man, woman, or child of his acquaintance. It may be argued, in op-
position, that the man drawing the prize may at the moment have
his hands clear of any injury, real or fancied. Well—what more
easy than to transfer his right to any “United Brother,” who may, at
the moment, burn to blacken the eye, or smash the nose of his
neighbour?
In the vanity of our heart, we really think this hint worth attend-
ing to. Might not also the magistrate of the district become an ho-
norary patron of every such institution ? -

citizens in the state of MAINE.
WE understand it is in contemplation to make Lambeth a port, and we
really see no reason why a place to which nature has been truly bountiful
should not have all the advantages to which its situation entitles it. Placed
at the corner of a bay, and connected at the back with the main land, we
do not see what is to prevent it from commanding the whole commerce of
Kennington. As a watering-place it already stands high, and its mud-
baths are thicker—and of course, therefore, more salubrious—than those
of Germany. It is true that invalids seldom find much benefit from
drinking the waters, but we have seen the process performed by boys on
the bank, who take up the liquid in vessels made from oyster-shells.
THE TALLOW MARKET.
DIPs have gone downwards, and a glut of fours has thrown the dealers
all at sixes and sevens. There were a few transactions in fat; and an in-
fluential holder is said not to have come out entirely with clean hands;
but this is mere surmise. The enormous quantity of dripping damped
the market at the close of the day; and a well-known cook lowered prices
to a frightful degree by throwing an enormous collection of miscellaneous
ſat into the scale, which was completely turned by the desperate measure
she resorted to.
MR. MUFFS INTRODUCTORY DISCOURSE.
The diffusion of useful knowledge which Mr. Muff placed at the
disposal of the pupils of his own medical school was felt to be so
useful by the students at large, that he had a wonderful audience on
the following Saturday, when, pursuant to his announcement, he
continued his lecture.
Jack Randall was by this time quite at home, and firmly established
in the good opinion of all his companions, who looked upon him as an
Artesian well of drollery, from the depths of whose inventive genius
a spring of unadulterated mischief was constantly gushing. He had
somewhat added to his popularity by a bold coup on the last board
day, when, in the face of all the old governors, who were standing
about the hall of the hospital, he drove up to the door outside a
hack cab, holding the whip and reins in one hand, and playing “Jim
along, Josey,” upon a second-hand cornet-à-piston with the other—an
instrument which stood very high in his notions of surpassing excel-
lence, because it made a great deal of noise with a very little trouble.
AN utterirrt of BAD notes.
“Hurrah, Manhugſ” he exclaimed, seeing our friend at the door,
“I’ve nailed a victim—capital case—two ribs fractured and dead-
drunk.”
The porter came to the door, and by their united efforts, the patient,
who was the real driver of the cab, was taken out.
“How did you contrive to catch him t” asked Manhug.
“Coming through Seven Dials, I saw a row—a fight between two
Cabbies, one of whom had thrown a paving-stone through the other's
window. The aggressor had just been picked up from his last round,
and was beaten to blancmange. They were going to take him into a
doctor's close by.”
“And why didn't they "
“Because I prevented it. I said, Don't take him there—blue-bottle
shop and flag-of-distress lamp over the door—sells soda-powders,
horse-balls, pitch-plasters, lucifers, and penny periodicals. Hospital's
the place, you know, for men of high reputation—accidents admitted
day and night, without letters of recommendation. So I boxed him
up all right in his own hutch, and here he is.”
The man was soon settled in a bed of the accident ward ; but being
still too much overcome by beer and beating to give any account of
himself, the next point was, how the horse and cab should be dis-
posed of—a question which Jack Randall soon made all right by
#. Rapp and Manhug inside, and driving off to Hampstead for a
ittle air.
But all this is an idle digression : we must return to Mr. Muff,
whose stay in town is necessarily limited from his rapidly-increasing
business at Clodpole. This ingenious gentleman, then, resumed his
post of last week; and, having tapped the ashes from his short pipe,
which he returned into a tin box and put into his pocket, he indulged
in a modest imbibition of the equally-commingled, and recommenced
as follows:–
“GENT LEMEN, There is a portion of your curriculum of study
which carries with it a subject of such vital importance that it de-
serves especial notice. I allude to the two courses of lectures upon
Botany which, by the politeness of the Apothecaries' Company, you
are permitted to attend. You must be deeply impressed with the
importance of thoroughly understanding the physiology of a stinging-

nettle in a case of fracture of the skull; and you cannot but laugh at
the pretension of a medical man who would attempt to unite a broken
bone without first being able to distinguish a daisy from a chamomile.
Nor, I am certain, if thrown upon your own skill, would you will-
ingly attend a case of croup or cholera, unless you were clearly
aware that the proper name of a buttercup was Ranunculus bulbosus—an
imposing title, well calculated to raise the importance of such an
humble vegetable production, and make it think no small sap
of itself.
The lecturers upon Botany—with their diagrams of large green
leaves that never grew upon any tree in the world, and collections
of half-dead garden-stuff which induces a lament that no rabbits or
guinea-pigs are kept to devour it—may be looked upon as scientific
Jacks-in-the-green. When summer comes and their sessions begin,
you will find they will tell you in their first lecture that “the produc-
tions of the teeming vegetable world furnish us with an inexhaustible
fund of scientific and gratifying amusement.” This is their idea.
Between ourselves, a man must be exceedingly hard up for friends
to find recreation in the society of a cowslip ; and whenever I hear
the lecturers affirm, with respect to vegetables, “that they rivet our
attention by their admirable combinations,” I cannot divest myself of
the idea, that they allude merely to lobster-salad and spring soup.
I believe, in the partially-unexplored regions on the banks of the
Thames in the neighbourhood of Chelsea, there is a large garden of
botanical curiosities. I think I have seen its trees from the steam-
boat, when I have been going to the “Bells” at Putney to eat stewed
eels. I have been told that lectures take place here—at Chelsea, not
at the “Bells” at Putney—at 8 o'clock in the morning. Possibly, if any
of you should ever be sufficiently enthusiastic to get up in the middle of
the night and go and hear them, you may be talked into a love of “puff-
aways” or “what's-o'clocks,” (I give the vulgar names,) and return
perfect enthusiasts. But as medical students do not generally go to
bed at half-past nine, I fear you will never get there. They like to
retire to rest with a lark, better than rising with one. But connected
with these gardens there is one point of great importance, which I
wish you to bear in mind. Should you ever find your way there, do
not forget to cultivate acquaintance with the gardeners. A few pots
of half-and-half will be well distributed in this cause; for you may
possibly find out, before you go up to “the Hall” for your examina-
tion, what plants have been ordered up for the purpose of testing
your botanical capabilities. You have then only to go home and
study them well: the examiners, without doubt, are, like thistles,
sharp and downy—but medical students are sometimes downier still.
FASHIONABLE ARRIVALS.
MR. Moses LEv1, at the Police-office, Bow-street, from a tour of in-
vestigation on Saffron-hill. Mr. Manhug, at Evans's Hotel, from the pit
of Covent Garden Theatre.
DEPARTURE.
MR. S.Nooks, from his lodging in Amwell-street, to some point with
which his landlady is perfectly unacquainted.
FLIGht of Fancy.
SLEEP AT WILL.
HAVING, from the incessant joking to which we are condemned in the
º: of “Punch,” been entirely deprived of rest, we applied to the late
r. Gardiner for advice, and for the “usual fee” bought his secret. His
own long sleep releases us from our pledge, and we proceed to divulge it
to the readers of “Punch,” otherwise the public. In ordinary cases he
recommended either
A. i. from the Morning Herald; or,
A leader from the Chronicle; or,
A ride in one of Hansom's cabs ; or,
An expected visit of the Queen to Edinburgh ; or,
A jocular critique in the Athenaeum.
In obstinate cases the hypnologist prescribed one speech of Charles
Kean's Hamlet—the first soliloquy being always a dose. But should that
prove ineffectual, and the patient's constitution be in a condition to stand
it, the whole part proves much more efficient. As this remedy, however,
many might consider worse than the disease, one column of Joe Hume's
speeches (including the calculations) we have ever found an infallible
mixture.
THE THAMES AND ITS TRIBUTARIES.
Having warmly taken up the Cold-Water Cure, for the benefit of its
deluded advocates and disciples, in furtherance of the objects of the “Cold-
Water Curing Society” (reported in our last) we proceed to give some
account of the great river which forms the materia medica used in the
modern practice of physic followed by the Hydropathists:—
As the author of a work from which we borrow the above title observes,
the Thames is the most important member of the fluvial—or more pro-
perly effluvial—system of Great Britain. The peculiarity and variety of
its effluvia, arising from the various tributaries that feed it during its
course, chemical analyses of which have been already given in “Punch.”
The earliest and most considerable of these consists of decomposed
vegetation supplied to Old Father Thames by the Berkshire and Surrey
marshes; and that this vegetable confluent may be agreeably mixed with
animal matter, a large number of drowned kittens is daily added by the
inhabitants of both banks of the river.
But it is just below Richmond that the most considerable tributaries of
the Thames commence their supplies. The Soap Works at Brentford send
in their emollient streams, and help to give to Thames-water that peculiar
softness so favourable to those industrious classes who take in washing.
Indeed Brentford may be looked upon as the most important feeder of the
Thames above bridge. Fell-mongers, gut and gin spinners, brewers, and
gas-makers here abound, and unite their energies and their offal to enrich
the consistency of the water. As it passes Chiswick, the fluid is improved
by large additions from the Ale Brewery ; and a little lower, so thick and
strong is it rendered by the confluence of the Hammersmith drains—so
materially is its specific gravity increased by the powerful ingredients they
supply—that it possesses the astonishing capability of holding the iron
bridge in suspension.
When these tributaries have been properly amalgamated and stirred
up by the piles of Putney and Battersea bridges, the water is considered
in a fit state to be supplied to the public, and for this purpose the Chelsea
Water-works were established.
Vauxhall contributes lime, Lambeth pours forth a rich amalgam from
the yards of knackers and bone-grinders, Horseferry liberally gives up all
its dead dogs, Westminster empties its treasures into the º stream
by means of a common sewer of uncommon dimensions, the Fleet-ditch
bears in its inky current the concentrated essences of Clerkenwell, Field-
lane, Smithfield,Cow-cross—and is, by means of its innumerable branches,
augmented by the potent ingredients of St. Giles's, Somers-town, Barbi.
can, St. Luke's, and the surrounding districts. The fluids of the White-
chapel slaughter-houses call in their transit through the Minories for the
contributions of Houndsditch, Ratcliffe Highway, Bevis Marks, and Good-
man's-fields, and thus richly laden pour their delicious slime into the
Thames by means of the Tower-ditch. Finally, the Surrey side yields
the refuse of tar-works and tan-yards, and it is allowed by all, that the
people of Deptford, Woolwich, and those situated in the lower course of
the stream, get the Thames water (which here
SUSTAins six DiFrenEnt characteas)
in the º: perfection.
With this account of the Thames and its tributaries, we for the present
take leave of the hydropathists, and beg to add that, should the editor of
Priessnitz's work apply to us for leave to re-print this article in his second
edition, we shall have no objection to grant film permission.
THE UGLINESS OF “CHARITY.”
WE have rarely perused a more touching remonstrance than the sub:
joined, which we have picked from a letter, addressed by “A Pedestrian”
to the Times, on the “Hoop Nuisance :”—
“I have at this moment a large scar on one of my shins—the legacy of
a severe wound—which festered, and was very painful for an entire month,
inflicted a year ago by the iron hoop of a whey-faced, cadaverous charity
boy from Tower-hill, who, on my remonstrating with him on his careless-
ness, added impudence to the injury, by significantly advancing his er-
tended fingers and thumb to his nose, and scampered off.”
We can sympathise with the “ Pedestrian.” Had the hoop been trun-
dled by a young gentleman, with a fine ruddy blooming complexion, from
Portland-square, the wrong would have been nothing: it is the “whey-face."
and the “cadaverousness,” and the “charity,” and the “Tower-hill,”
that “fester’’ and leave the “scar.” As for the little miscreant's “ex-
tended fingers and thumb to his nose,” we can pardon that. The boy felt
he had done wrong, and morely wished to “take a sight” of the injury.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
JUVENILE BIOGRAPHY.
No. II.-JACK SPRAT.
The Sprats of Northumberland, from whom it is possible that our
hero was descended, if not in a direct, at least in a zigzag line, were
settled on the border in the time of the Stuarts, and were always re-
markable for their fidelity to the reigning family. In none of the re-
cords of rebellion that constitute the annals of the time in which the
insurrection was at its height, do we find the name of Sprat ; and we
are therefore bound to conclude, that if any of our hero's ancestors
were in the interest of the Pretender, they took care to keep them-
selves in the background—a caution for which the Sprats of Tad-
caster, a branch from the family tree, were also remarkable.
There have been some attempts made to fix a martial or enterpris-
ing character on the house of Sprat, by a reference to the well-
known proverb about catching a herring ; and it has been said that
a renegade bearing the name of Herring had actually once been
caught by the energy of one Sprat; which, it is alleged by some, is
the origin of the well-known proverb. Having sifted this
story in the cinder-box of research, and allowed the refuse to fall
into the dusthole of contempt, we find very little remaining on the
shovel of truth to feed the fire of biography. We had therefore ra-
ther proceed with the poker of perseverance, and trust to the tongs
of discrimination for filling the literary scuttle from which we are to
draw our materials.
It is to be regretted that the early history of Sprat is enveloped in
one of those November fogs in which the antiquary delights to
revel. We have consulted the Heraldry of Fish, and have perused the
elaborate writings of Thomas à Kempis from beginning to end; but
we have been unable to strike a literary light; and even the works
of Congreve, of which we have consulted an illuminated copy, leave
us as much, or rather more, in the dark than before upon every point
we have been eager to elucidate.
Jack Sprat, we are justified in saying, was born on the day when
his mother was confined; and it is not unlikely that she died
in giving him birth, for nothing more—or, indeed, we might rather
say, nothing at all—was ever heard of her.
Our hero's father was a person who lived obscurely in the place
where he resided, and followed the occupation to which he devoted
his time, occasionally varying it with that necessary relaxation with
which he was able, as well as willing, to indulge himself.
Young Jack, for such was our hero's name, must have been either
a spoiled or an ill-treated child, for it is only by adopting one of
these suppositions that we can in any way account for the extra-
ordinary trait which forms the prominent feature of his character.
“Jack Sprat,” says the historian, with a bold and nervous eloquence
that none but a literary giant would have ventured to use—for the
coarseness of the language is only redeemed by its terrible truthful-
ness—“Jack Sprat could eat no fat l”—a line which we never read
without a sickening sensation that can only be accounted for by the
severe rigour of the rather disagreeable narrative.
Why could he eat no fat f is the natural inquiry on perusing an
announcement so peculiarly inconsistent with lettered elegance ;
and we can only presume that Jack had either been compelled to eat
fat to an unreasonable extent, or that he had been foolishly indulged
in a boyish disgust for it. Whichever way it may have been, it is
clear that young Sprat had fallen into unskilful hands; and the
truth of the proverb of “Train up a child” was never more strongly
exemplified, than in the hatred of fat which Jack, to a late period of
his life—certainly until long after his marriage—was in the habit of
exhibiting.
The allusion to Jack's marriage naturally brings us to the second
line of the pleasing little epic, when his wife, in all the highly-
coloured hues of domestic privacy, starts vigorously on the canvas of
history. The woman chosen by Sprat for the partner of his joys,
and the sharer of his sorrows, was distinguished by a peculiarity of
taste exactly opposite to that for which her husband has become
illustrious. “His wife could eat no lean,” is the affecting language
of the poet—for affecting it must indeed be considered, when it
announces a state of appetite which we defy the least fastidious
reader to contemplate without experiencing a shock of more or less
violence.
If we were disposed to enter into the wide field of physiology, we
should probably ask how it is possible for a woman to have arrived
at such a state of hopeless hoggery as to have rendered her incapable
of eating “any lean ;” but as it is certain that our question would not
be answered, we shall at once refrain from putting it.
It must be obvious to the reflecting mind, that an antipathy to fat
on one side, and a hatred of lean on the other, must have led to a
social result of no small importance in domestic economy, and we are
therefore prepared for the animated burst of the bard, in which he
tells us without the smallest circumlocution, that—
“Between them both they lick'd the platter clean.”
The discrimination of Sprat in selecting a partner whose tastes
were opposite to his own we cannot fail to admire, and there is no
doubt that domestic bliss is more often secured by a happy contrast
of dispositions than by a similarity of inclination which is likely to
engender on both sides a feeling of competition which might be highly
dangerous to wedded happiness.
The close of the career of Sprat is buried under the weight of ob-
scurity, and though we have resorted to the crow-bar of industry in
moving up the large masses of information which crowd the book-
shelves of the British Museum, we lose all trace of Sprat after the
licking of the platter which is the last act of his life that history has
chronicled.
His wife is altogether swamped in the sea of insignificance, and
Fairburn's edition of Jack Sprat is the only one in which we ever
have been able to meet with her portrait. She is represented with a
dab of red on the centre of each cheek, and the colour of the arm
extends beyond its natural outline—an ingenious design of the artist
to mark the excessive tendency to fat for which she was remarkable.

GARDENING DIRECTIONS.
CI.E.An your windows of deceased roots. Empty the mould from
red pots, and put them carefully away in sizes (one within the other)
till the spring season. Cut down dead beanstalks, and remove string
from exterior of garret wall, and carry mignonette boxes into back
washhouse.
In Metropolitan gardens, your beds will now be covered every
morning with a rich loamy soot from neighbouring chimney-pots.
Dig in with a spade, and throw a light layer of cinders over the
surface, taking care to earth-up again, which may be done on the
spot with the dust-shovel.
Cut grass plats, and rake off children whenever they want to run
upon the sward, which will never stand the winter without a severe,
and perhaps a fatal attack of the mange, if the juveniles are per-
mitted to play about on it.
Your indoor operations may now be begun upon. Draw your
salary every Saturday, and bank some of it up, if you can, for future
use ; but if it will not keep, make the best you can of it. Take off
muslin from frames; and you may now make up your beds for the
winter with an additional blanket. Put in the Prussian, or rather
the French Blouse, so that, if it remains up all the winter, you may
have it for use early in the spring; and take out the thick-coatod
pea—for immediate service.

Roulogne, October 12.—The “right of search” still continues at the
Custom-house with all its accustomed chivalric vigour. Duties are levied
with surprising vigilance. A young lady, arrived last week by the
Emerald, had to pay for her red hair, it being all of English growth. A
deaf gentleman, being seized with English cotton in his ears, was com-
pelled to resort, on the spot, to oakum.
It is painful to observe that national asperities are still entertained
here by many of the inhabitants. Several shopkeepers have refused to
make money of the English ; especially of those parties who have re-
fused to deal with them. Master Jenkins, at Mr. Bird's English
academy, was yesterday assailed by two fish-boys on the port with the
cry of “cochon.” We regret, for the sake of our country, to add, that
the English Consul here has not written to Louis Philippe on the subject.
The English Tariff has had no influence upon the market; geese ap-
pearing in their usual number.
As to matters of literature, it may be especially gratifying to Mr.
Colburn to know, that Percival Keene may already be purchased for four
shillings. (Shall we forward him a copy )
On Šind; week the cavalry of the National Guard was called out ;
but, we are happy to say, although considerable anxiety is manifested, no
accident occurred to any of the force.

UNPUBLISHED CORRESPONDENCE
Between
LORD ASHBURTON AND MR. WEBSTER, ON THE BOUNDARY
QUESTION. -
LETTER I.
Lord Ashburton to Mr. Webster.
SIR,--I am a very old man, and I have come out to the United States
for the sake of peace and quietness between England and America. My
private opinion about the Boundary Line is, that there is a considerable
quantity of gammon on both sides, to say nothing of the enormous amount
of spinnage that has been the result of the yarns which former negociators
have been spinning. Diplomacy is all my eye, and perhaps, Sir, if I
added Elizabeth Martin, I should not be going too far in my description
of it.
I think, Sir, it would be almost as pertinent on my part to inquire of
you whether your mother knows you are out, as to ask whether the
mother country is to be done out of a large portion of territory, which is
fit for nothing at all but to grow thistles; and as such I willingly give it
up to produce food for the American citizens.
In my conference with you, I believe I distinctly stated that I came out
for the sake of peace ; and though I am instructed to stick up for the
right of fishing for oysters in the St. John's river, I do not say I may not
make a concession on this point, if the comfort of the natives is an object
with your government. I must, however, distinctly declare, that I can-
not resign the right of looking at the mile-stone on the boundary road;
and this point I am the more resolute upon, because I think you told me
it was to you a matter of indifference. If I was mistaken, pray let me
know, and I will reconsider the matter; but, if I understand you rightly,
and you do not object to the concession, then, Sir, let me tell you em-
phatically that the honour and dignity of the great nation I represent
must be maintained ; and I shall adhere resolutely to the right of visiting
the mile-stone alluded to.
Permit me to repeat, Sir, that I am a very old man, and am determined
on peace; for it would ill-become me, at my time of life, to assist in pro-
moting warfare.
With assurances of my distinguished consideration,
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
Ashburton.
LETTER II.
From Mr. Webster to Lord Ashburton.
The undersigned, in the name of the American Government, accedes to
all that Lord Ashburton expresses his readiness to give up, while the
undersigned consents to nothing that Lord Ashburton requires.
(Signed) DANIEL WEBSTER.
LETTER III.
Lord Ashburton to Mr. Webster.
SIR,-Your note is so far satisfactory, that it agrees to my concessions
on the part of England, and your obliging intimation that you consent to
nothing, I am extremely grateful for. If, Sir, you will only let me know
the heads of a treaty, it shall be drawn up ; for I am an old man, and
peace, as I said before, is my object. If I misunderstood that you would
concede on the question of the mile-stone, be so good as to set me right.

And believe me, with renewed assurances of rather more distinguished
consideration than I expressed in my last letter, your obedient servant,
Ashbuhton.

LETTER IV.
Mr. Webster to Lord Ashburton.
The undersigned will consider any treaty drawn up by Lord Ashburton
on the basis already understood between the undersigned and Lord Ash-
burton. (Signed) ANIEL WEBster.
LETTER W.
Lord Ashburton to Mr. Webster.
SIR,-The treaty is now ready for signature, and though I must insist
upon the extreme justice of all I ask, yet as I now ask for nothing, there
can be no further ground, for difference. I shall return to my own
country with the full conviction that I have done nothing inconsistent with
what, at my time of life, could have been expected ; and as I came out
with a determination to maintain peace, I have fully accomplished the
object of my mission.
I have several books of arguments, proving the justice of all that
England demands, but as these demands are now relinquished, it would
be useless to trouble you with any of them.
I remain, Sir, with accumulated assurances of my most distinguished
consideration, your very humble and obliged servant,

MARINERs are requested to take notice, that a bundle of straw is sus-

and all vessels of more than fourteen pounds burden are to avoid the arch
corresponding with the point indicated by the ship's compass.
The underwriters at Lloyd's have caused a rushlight to be placed in the

gulations are to be observed by all Captains coming within hail as have
been hitherto enforced at the Eddystone.
Part of a china cup, marked Present from Ramsgate, was picked up
by a skipper on the sands at Battersea. It is supposed to be a portion of
the furniture of the Duchess of Kent Steamer, which lurched off Broad-

GO HOME.
AN AUTUMNAL LYRIC.
“Go Home !” thus Prudence says—the breeze is sighing,
In mournful requiems over Nature's bloom;
On the hill-tops the virgin frost is lying,
Weaving the shroud of Autumn's early tomb.
The butterfly has flown—hush'd is the bee,
And London now, has sights and charms for me.
The lazy steamers sleep upon the river,
Where late in crowded pride they glided on ;
On their forsaken decks pale wanderers shiver,
And smoke cigars till the last puff is gone.
All Nature heralds surly Winter's reign—
Like other females, Nature can speak plain
No longer cherries, twenty for a penny,
With blushing ripeness woo the passer-by;
Nor plums, nor pears, (of which if eat too many,
The young devourer oft will heave a sigh)
In tempting lots garnish the three-legg'd stall,
Now vanish'd like “thin air” their bunches all.
The gulls—I mean the birds—now think of flying
Across the Channel, to some warmer home ;
On Brighton beach the swallows dead are lying,
Knock'd down by urchin boys in Ocean's foam.
All things proclaim the Autumn of the year;
Candles is riz, and butter's getting dear.
Go Home ! the lone half-sovereign in thy pocket
Will take thee thither, by the Union coach,
If “cold without” thou 'lt stand ; or else the Rock, t
On thy finances will not much encroach.
But if thy lucky stars can raise the tin,
Thy happier fate may compass “warm within.”
Go Home 1 go Home ! thy landlady expects thee,
Thy chambers are fresh garnish'd, swept and clean.
No ancient ghosts of last year's bills perplex thee,
No cross shall come thee and thy love between.
All-all shall compensate thy wish to roam—
Nature and Prudence whispor thee “Go Home !”
THE TARIFF.
The importation of foreign cattle is going on surprisingly. We saw a
Jerusalem pony in Clare-market yesterday. It is distinguished from the
ordinary pony by much longer ears, a black cross on the back, and a
curious habit of uttering mournful sounds at irregular intervals.
We have been told that it is now common to meet with a peculiar rab-
bit, called Welsh, in many of the London taverns. It is said to have the
flavour of cheese, and is declared by those who have tasted it to be an ex-
cellent relish. The trade of Wales will, of course, feel the benefit of this
new provision of the tariff, for, from the number of Welsh rabbits said to
be consumed in London, the communication with England must be of the
most rapid and constant character.
The York ham trade is a good deal impaired by the new tariff, but we
cannot congratulate the consumer on those scraggy black-looking affairs
which appear to be stitched up in pieces of soot-bags, and are aptly deno-
minated West-failures.
SONGS OF THE FLOWERS.
No. v.–THE SONG of the sweet PEA.
I'm a sweet, sweet pea,
And I come in early spring
To listen to the bee,
When 'tis first upon the wing:
The roses on their stem
More beautiful may be ;
But I will not envy them.
I'm a sweet, sweet peal
They tell me I shall go
When the summer-time is past;
I'm an annual, I know,
Too sweet, perhaps, to last:
Too delicate a flower,
Rude winter's face to see,
I bloom in sunshine's hour,
A sweet, sweet peal
There’s a thorn upon the rose,
That repels affection's press;–
I never wounded those
Who gave me their caress.
Though its beauty soon is past,
And neglected it may be,
It is grateful to the last—
The sweet, sweet peaſ
ROYALTY ON RAIL-ROADS.
The Atlas thus sermonises upon royalty “by the rail’’:—
“We are aware that every precaution is taken by the directors and
managers of the Great Western Railway, when her Majesty makes use of
a special train, and we are not less acquainted with the courage and
absence of all fear from the mind of the Queen. But a long regency in
this country would be so fearful and tremendous an evil, that we cannot
but desire, in common with many others, that those royal railway excur-
sions should be, if possible, either wholly abandoned or only occasionally
resorted to.”
| There is danger by the railway; and therefore, says the Atlas, the
Queen should be only “occasionally ” exposed to it. Say the chances
against accident are as nineteen to twenty, shall the Queen “take a
chance : * “Yes,” says loyalty, “the Queen may occasionally take a
chance 2''
A NOTE FROM SIBTHORPE.
IN order to settle the unhappy difference between this country and the
celestial empire, we should recommend that Lord Monteagle should be
sent out on a special mission, for such is the reverence entertained by the
Chinese people for Rice, that at seed time they hold a festival in honour
of it. Spring Rice would consequently be certain to conciliate the people
and the government.
VERY LIKELY.
FROM the dilapidated condition of some houses in the city which are
shored up—as the phrase goes—with twelve-inch deal, it would seem that
the landlord must enjoy the prospect of his property falling in rapidly.
BREAD WIT.
Colonel Sibthorpe was complaining the other day to his baker of the
tardiness shown in reducing the price of bread. “Why, Colonel,” re-
marked the tradesman, “you should remember that bread is bread.” “Is
it, indeed 2 ” replied the gallant officer; “I should have said, from its
continued high price, it was stationary.” The baker at once treated his
distinguished customer to half-a-quartern.

LETTER XIII.-How LEARNING MAY BE OBTAINED–BY SHAVING; AND
OTHER MEANS.
You tell me, I have not answered your request. You say, you
feel—and I hope you do—the full force of my arguments on the
beauty of borrowing; nevertheless, I have not forwarded to you the
list of books that, of all others, are the first to be borrowed. You
say you wish to become a reader. It is a laudable aspiration.
Readers, my dear son, are of two sorts. There is a reader who
carefully goes through a book; and there is a reader who carefully
lets the book go through him. Which do you desire to be
Whilst it is necessary that you should have the mere cant phrases
of literature, I would, as your affectionate father, counsel you against
any unseemly pedantry. You may, without sacrificing any of the
time due to the serious purposes of life, obtain a sufficient knowledge
of books, whereby to pass for a man of very considerable informa-
tion; and, in this world, a successful seeming is every bit as good as
the real thing. Look around upon men; behold the stations they
fill, and tell Ine if it be not so.
You shave once a day. Well, purchase a cheap copy of Black-
stone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. You will perceive
that in his Preface, Sir William speaks of the necessity of every gen-
tleman knowing something of the statutes he lives under. Now, my
dear boy, I would have you learn the laws of your country, as I would
have you, ere you entered an orchard to pluck the best fruit grow-
ing there, know the whereabout of the man-traps and the wires of
the spring-guns. Having such knowledge, you may here pluck a
pippin, here gather a plum; and cramming your pockets full of the
juiciest produce of the place, return over the wall whence you came
without a single scratch, and altogether shot-free. Now, you have
only to consider the whole world an orchard guarded by the man-
traps and spring-guns of laws; and have only to know where the laws
are laid, that though you intrude upon them ever so closely, you are
never caught or hit by them. Do this, and who is to charge you with
having pilfered a single codlin You have never been caught in the
trap, the law has never fired upon you, and you have therefore your
action for libel against any man who shall dare so much as to wink
at you and call out “codlins !”
To return. You shave once a day *. Well, tear off a leaf, and
whilst you are stropping your razor, carefully read it. This is so
much time saved; and by this daily practice, you will in due season
digest the whole of the Commentaries. Sometimes you will go over
your beard a second or a third time, whereupon, strop your razor
again and again, and go through two or three pages. I knew a Lord
Chancellor who, like Lord Chesterfield's friend, was “such an econo-
mist of time,” that he went through all the Statutes in this manner.
* Punch confesses that he owes the idea of this process to the Earl of Chesterfield,
who in his “Letter ci.” to his son, suggests even a more ingenious mode of absorbing
the essence of “all the Latin Pi ts.” .
Being happily blessed with a very stubborn beard, he lathered him-
self at least thrice a morning; on each occasion getting by heart
three leaves of legal wisdom. I have known him declare that as a
lawyer, he was confident he owed all his prosperity in life to close
shaving.
You are to consider that the operation of shaving is singularly
auspicious to study. The soul seems retired from the surrounding
Vanities of the world, and takes refuge in itself. A great novelist has
declared that if, when he last rose from his desk, he left a pair of
lovers in a quandary, had his hero or heroine at a dead-lock,
wanted a lucky escape, or an ingenious discovery, he went to bed
serenely certain that the whole difficulty would be solved with the
shaving soap of the next morning". Hence, his novels may be con-
sidered as much the offspring of the razor, as of the goose-quill. I
much question whether the lack of imaginative works among the
modern Jewish Rabbis may not be attributed to their copiousness of
beard: they never shave ; hence, in a lofty, dignifying sense, they
never think.
Having gone through Blackstone, razor in hand, you may then in
like manner address yourself to ancient and modern history. You
will know quite as much of the Medes and Persians, the builders of
the Pyramids, Magna Charta, and all such shadowy matters, after a
month's good stropping, as if you had sat with your brow between
your thumbs, pondering and dreaming for a twelvemonth. You will
have got by heart a pretty catalogue of names; and names, not things,
are quite sufficient for a man, if he will but troll them boldly over
his tongue, as though he had the most intimate acquaintance with all
that belonged to them. “Wirtue and learning,” says Philip, Lord
Chesterfield, “like gold, have their intrinsic value: but if they are
not polished, they certainly lose a great deal of their lustre : and
even polished brass will pass upon inore people than rough gold.”
Lord Chesterfield knew what was due to life and—the peerage.
There is also another way of obtaining the wisdom of books. You
have doubtless seen the advertisements of benevolent sages who pro-
fess to cure disease by simply smelling certain drugs and simples.
Nothing need be swallowed, nothing need be administered. These
doctors owe nothing to the natural teaching of the ibis, to whom, if
history speak truly, Esculapius was so much indebted. All they re-
quire is, that a patient shall have a nose; and that organ granted,
they guarantee a cure. In like manner, do many very clever people
obtain learning: they smell the volumes—nothing more. They take
a good sniff of a book, and history, politics, poetry, polemics, all fly up
their nose in particles, like so much hartshorn; luor is such a mode
of education, in the words of the revered Doctor Busby, to be
sneezed at.
If this were not the fact, do you think so many persons would pur-
chase libraries : Do you suppose they buy the books to pore over
them? Certainly not. It is sufficient that they have the volumes on
their shelves; there is an aroma of learning arises from them ; it is
received into the system of the owner, and he is, and cannot help it,
learned. If this were not the case, think you so many human asses
would lay out so much money on russia-bindings? No: they care-
fully shelf the books, and catch learning, as they sometimes catch
cold, by coming down the staircase.
Having said thus much, it is I think unnecessary for me to give
you a list of books for your private study. All that is necessary, is to
borrow the volumes, and those as handsome as possible, and having once
secured the books, the learning in them is, of course, your own. I
would, however, advise you to carefully study The Newgate Calendar,
a work enshrining so many instances of human ingenuity, courage,
and suffering ; a mine of gold from which philosophic novelists have
cast pocket heroes for ladies, and mantel-piece ornaments for board-
ing-schools. You will find in the literary offshoots of the records of
the gallows, that the human soul is in its composition, very like a ball
of India-rubber; the lower it falls, the higher it bounds. Or it may
be likened to the Greek fire, that burns the brightest in a common
Sewer.
I would advise you also to take a peep into the Grecian mythology;
there are some pretty names there with which you may sometimes
spangle your discourse, not unprofitably. There is also much moral
instruction to be gathered from the stories. Let me particularly recom-
mend to you the tale of the abduction of Proserpine by Pluto. Pro-
serpine has been promised a full divorce from the king of hell, if she
have tasted nothing in his dominions. Unable to control herself, she
has eaten a pomegrantae seed, and the divorce does not stand good. I
haveno doubt (if it could be discovered) that this case has been consi-
dered in many judgments of the ecclesiastical court.

History has been called “philosophy, teaching by example.” You
|
may, if you will, consult it in this spirit; but the truest philosophy,
teaching by example, that ever came under my notice, was in a little
town in France, at a bookseller's shop.
The beautiful national song Malbrough s'en ra-t-en guerre, words and
music, lay open in the window ; and there stood an old Frenchwoman,
holding in her hand a little Gaul of some six years old, whom like a
young starling she was at once teaching words and song. . What a
labour of love she made of her task How she crowed forth the air,
jigging, as it does, with contempt for England, and how the child
chirrupped after her
“Malbrough s'en va-t-en guerre,
Mironton, mironton, mirontaine,
Malbrough s'en va-t-en guerre,
Ne sait quand reviendra !”
“There, indeed,” said I to myself, gazing on the old woman and
her pupil; “there, indeed, is History, there is Philosophy teaching
by example !” .

PUNCH'S COMIC MYTHOLOGY.
chap. I.--THE APPLE OF DISCORD.
The RE was a call of upper house in High Olympus—a greater
sensation had never been produced; for, upon the absorbing ques-
tion of the Apple of Discord, the strength of parties was to be tried.
It was one of those extraordinary occasions when the lower house, or
Minorum Gentium, was admitted to the discussions of the Dii Majorum.
Exactly at the fifth turn of Time's glass, Jupiter took the chair.
The clouds were crowded in every part, except those below reserved
for the Commons, who were not immediately summoned. After the
presentation of several petitions,
Bacchus would take that opportunity of putting a question to a
noble goddess opposite. The fact was, his car was daily filled with
petitions from the starving population of the plains, through the-he
must be excused for using a strong expression—the gross and repre-
hensible neglect of the department over which the noble goddess
(Ceres) presided. It could not be denied that the agricultural inter-
ests were hourly sacrificed, by the most reckless negligence ;-the
corn-growers were in despair (Hear.) His own (Bacchus's) temples
were, in consequence, entirely deserted : so great was the depression,
that people could not even afford to get drunk. (Shame, shame.) He
could anticipate the noble lady's answer—he could appreciate a
mother's feelings—(a laugh from Vesta.) He was fully aware of the
bereavement which would be pleaded in excuse for the utter aban-
donment of every branch of the corn trade. But what were the
facts : The presiding duty of the fruitful earth had, for a long
period, paired off with Iaachus, for the purpose of seeking her daughter
Proserpine. She had searched Sicily in vain, and that every facility
might be afforded for discovering her lost child, noble gods had, in
the most handsome manner, voted a couple of torches for the top of
Mount Etna, that the bereaved mother might continue her researches
at night". At length her perseverance was rewarded, and she learnt
that it was Pluto who had forcibly abducted Proserpine; at the same
time he had, as honourably became him (Pluto), offered to become her
(Ceres') son-in-law. Now, it was of her protracted absence from the
duties of the earth that he (Bacchus) complained. Of what avail
were further delays, when it was so well known that Proserpine had
gone to —(Loud crics of “order,”) to—to Hades :
FACE of the Earuth.
------
* Ovid Metam.
CEREs explained. She had determined not to ascend to Olympus,
or to suffer the earth to bring forth, till she had seen her daughter.
It was now, however, her happiness to state, that by the kindness of
an illustrious personage, she had an interview with her beloved child
that morning. (Loud cheers.) Her answer to the noble god oppo-
site was, therefore, her presence at Olympus, and the draught of a
thorough amendment of the corn laws, which she held in her hand.
—Here the matter dropped.
A noble god, who spoke with a Scottish accent, seeing the Lord
High Admiral in his place, begged to inquire when the navy estimates
would be ready. He complained that the expenditure of the preced-
ing cycle considerably exceeded the estimates furnished by the noble
and gallant god (Neptune). He considered that the number of Tri-
tons was considerably greater than the exigencies of the public service
required; but with regard to the extravagant establishment of Ne-
reides and ocean-nymphs, he was quite at a loss to conceive upon
what principle that could be defended. He therefore gave notice, that
should the navy estimates for the ensuing cycle include these unne-
cessary extravagances, he should oppose them.
NEPTUNE acknowledged the noble god's courtesy in giving him
timely notice of his intention ; but he was not prepared to say when
the estimates would be brought forward. With regard to the in-
creased number of Tritons, they had been found absolutely necessary
during the deluge of Deucalion".
Other preliminary business having been disposed of,
MER.cuny moved that the Minorum Gentium do attend below the
bar of this House. The utmost anxiety and curiosity then prevailed;
and shortly afterwards the members of the lower House made their
appearance, with that tumultuous disorder for which they have been
in all ages so notorious. After this had somewhat subsided, the order
of the day was read, and the House resolved itself pro formá into com-
mittee. On Jupiter putting his thunderbolts under the table,
MERcuRY rose amidst the most breathless attention.
the indulgence of the House on account of the difficulties of his
situation. If the investigation upon which they were about to enter
was looked upon as one of extreme delicacy by the House at large,
what must be his (Mercury's) feelings, upon whom the task of open-
ing it had devolved But he never had shrunk from his duty, and
never would. (IIear, hear.) IIe would therefore proceed at once to
the subject under discussion.—It would be within the recollection of
noble and honourable gods, that the marriage feast on Mount Pelion,
to which they had all descended, was one of the most sumptuous
splendour and magnificence. Indeed, considering the host was no-
thing but a mortal—a mere king of Thessaly—that entertainment
did honour to his taste and liberality (Cheers); it was, in short, a fête
worthy of a man who had gods for his guests and a lovely Nereid for
his bride. On the other hand, it was a feast calculated to excite the
envy, the spleen, of the uninvited. (“No, no,” from sereral coices among
the demi-gods.) He could well understand those cries of dissent from dis-
appointed demigods. (Order.) Nay, more, it was the base, the spiteful,
the malignant act of one of their number, to whom no card of invitation
had been sent, which originated the unhappy differences in Olympus
they (the noble and honourable gods) had met to heal. It will be re-
membered, when the enchanting Thetis was dispensing the hospitality
of her new lord with her most fascinating smiles—when the wines, so
delicately icedt, had contributed their maximum of hilarity—when
Momus was letting off his best jokes in the midst of the last new song
so divinely warbled by an honourable member of the lower House
—this was the delicious moment chosen by Discordia to disturb, not
only the harmony of Orpheus, but that of the entire assembly. En-
vious herself, she determined to sow the seeds of envy amongst all
the female portion of Peleus's guests, by throwing an apple upon the
board, inscribed with the words, Detur pulchriori. Now if those words
meant anything, they implied that the pippin—
PosionA would take leave to correct the noble speaker;-it was a
love-apple.
M Encunx was always happy to be set right in a misconception.
Well, then, those words implied that the love-apple was “thrown to
the fairest.” “Now, I put it to noble gods and honourable demi-
gods,” continued the illustrious Hermes, “whether any expedient
could have been more artfully contrived—more certain to insure the
kind of success the disappointed daughter of Nox desired, than this
IIere were assembled the loveliest of mortals the earth could produce,
mingling with unrestrained festivity with cloud-existing immortals
• Ovid (Metam., i. 335) gives a description of Triton sounding with his conch-
shell the retreat to the waters.
t This, as applied to the domestic manners of the Greeks, is perfectly correct. To
preserve their wines, they kept them frozen breaking and thawing the vinous ice
as it was required for the table.
He begged

—with the élite of Olympus—why”—added the eloquent deity, with
considerable emphasis—“even Venus herself was there !” (Ironical
cheers). “Those opposition cheers are not lost upon me ; I wish no
concealment, and, to prevent their recurrence, I boldly avow that I
stand here the honoured champion of the Queen of Beauty " " (Amidst
the cheers which followed this arowal Vulcan was obserred to leare the House.)
MARs, who rose with much warmth, would ask his noble friend
whether he meant to arrogate to himself honours and duties which
the smile-loving (pixoumeiohs) goddess had exclusively awarded to
him (the noble commander-in-chief of the Olympian forces)?
Mencu Ry explained. He must admit he used the word “cham-
pion” inadvertently; but intended it to bear a strictly parliamentary
signification. What he ought to have said was, that he appeared as
the “advocate” of Venus.
MARs professed himself satisfied, and the noble speaker proceeded.
“Here, then, at the nuptial feast of Peleus and Thetis was con-
gregated a galaxy of beauty never surpassed for its brilliancy; but,
amidst this congeries of stars, were there not many who thought, from
the fancied superiority of their charms, that the apple was especially
sent to them Assuredly there were ! I will not pain you, sire,”
continued the god, addressing the chair, “by describing the scene of
confusion which followed. I need only state, that at length the
mortals, whatever each thought of her own personal attractions, gave
way, with becoming discipline, to . their superiors; and the discord
produced by the quarrel-sowing fruit is now concentrated between
Juno, Minerva, and Venus. This, then, brings me to the core of my
subject, namely, the rival claims of our illustrious coadjutors. For-
tunately, the advocacy of these will not occupy much more of their
godships' time. (Loud cries of “hear” from all parts of the house). The
argument lies in a nutshell. Sire, had the mischievous missile been
addressed to the noblest, the most dignified, or—with all deference
to Vesta—to the most virtuous, a dissentient voice could not be
raised against the claims of Juno ; had it been inscribed ‘to the
wisest, who would have dared to withhold it from Minerva —but it
was especially directed ‘to the fairest, and I will not insult the
penetration of this honourable and illustrious assembly by pointing
out to whom those words directly and unequivocally apply. Future
proceedings will decide, and I resume my seat with the fullest con-
fidence as to the ultimate result.” . The noble god concluded by
moving that a select committee, consisting of members belonging to
both houses, be appointed to consider and report upon the claims of
the three goddesses, with a view to awarding the Apple of Discord to
one of them.
MARs, with his usual brevity, seconded the motion, and,
THEMIs" opposed the proposition upon grounds strictly constitu-
tional. There was no precedent for such a proceeding; it had been
the unvarying rule to refer questions unreservedly to the throne,
and abide by its decision. (Hear.) -
JANUs was opposed to both sides of the question, and would Inove
an amendment. He would state his reasons for doing so. (Murmurs,
mingled with whispers of “Adjourn,”) and he would boldly state that it
would be utterly impossible to come to a sound and impartial decision
on this absorbing question in Olympus at all ! (loud cries of “Order.”)
He was quite in order, and would prove himself so. Firstly, he would
consider the ordinary course suggested by the honourable and learned
lady chief justice; that of referring the question to the sole arbitration
of the throne itself. Let them (honourable demi-gods and illustrious
Consentes) consider who one of the litigants is—let them reflect that
she (Juno) is a power behind the throne, sometimes greater than the
throne itself ; (Immense sensation, crics of “Order” rererberated from crery
part of the House.)
MET is rose to order. The god upon his legs would not have dared
to utter such language, except in committee. He took a mean advan-
tage of that circumstance :-he knew well enough that the thunder-
bolts were under the table.
JANus continued. Well, then, he would put it in another light.
One of the parties to this dispute is the highest female personage in
the realms—the proposed arbiter imperium her husband. Under
such circumstances how could the latter decide but in her (the illus-
trious lady's) favour ! We now come to the original proposition. A
select committee forsooth ! The noble mover knew what the result of
such a measure would be. IIe knew well enough that, however care-
fully it was composed, the partisans of the queen of beauty would
greatly preponderate, for the extensive benevolence of that illustrious
lady was notorious. What honourable or noble god had not felt the
power of her (the goddess of beauty's) charms—and he would add,
what god, or demi-god, had felt that power in vain? (Hear, hear.) Was
* Question for the next examination of the London University Jurisprudence
Class —Why did the ancients typify law by an old woman
it then to be supposed, that when acting in a judicial capacity, noble
and honourable deities would overlook her claims to their gratitude 1
It was not to be supposed : and the illustrious god of chicanery was
right in proclaiming his confidence in the result. He now came to
his own amendment—it was simply this; that some mortal be selected
to make the award.
This startling proposal created a most astonishing sensation.
THEMI's struggled to be heard amidst deafening cries of “Divide,
divide,” and it was only by Zeus resorting to the extreme measure
of re-producing his thunderbolts, that the confusion ceased. At
length strangers were ordered to withdraw for a division.
On our return we found that Janus's amendment was carried by a
large majority. After some further discussion, it was agreed that the
dispute should be referred to Paris, a young gentleman of Mount Ida,
and the IIouse adjourned.
THE BOYS' OWN COLUMN.
For the amusement of our juvenile readers we have been at the
pains of collecting a few particular jokes, whereof the youthful, as
well as the mature, mind, we hope, will be able to discern the wit.
foruwait D pupil.
These jokes are rational, because they are reasonable; and reason-
able because they are cheap ; they are cheap because they are made
at the expense of others. The fun in them, in fact, is practical ;
which, to the good, sound, sterling sense that is our country's boast,
will doubtless be a great recommendation. We cannot say that they
are innocent, exactly ; but, then, very few good jokes are so. Wit,
that sort of it, at least, which makes one laugh, generally hurts some-
body's feelings ; and what essential difference is there between say-
ing a sharp thing to a person, and running one into him ;
The jocosity of uncivilised man, or, as some term it, native wit, is
eminently practical ; now, the savage and the child are on a par in
point of intellect, and what is fun for one is fun for the other. The
North-American Indian, it is well-known, literally roasts his fellow-
creature, who, they say, takes the joke with remarkable temper,
however excruciating, may killing, it may be. As the Red Man ad-
vances in intellect and morality, the use of caustic language will
supersede that of the actual cautery, and the living target of toma-
hawks will become the butt of ridicule. So, we hope, the child who
puts stinging nettles into his sister's bed, or sticks needles in his
uncle's chair, will learn, as he grows up, to wound by personal sar-
Casin. -
For the benefit of those many worthy persons who may be slow
at perceiving the point of the jests which we are about to relate, we
shall take the liberty, which we hope the more acute will pardon, of
pointing it out as we go on.
Master Dick Miles displayed an early turn for drollery. One day,
while home for the holidays, he procured a large marrow-bone, which
he filled with gunpowder, rammed tightly down, with a quantity of wet
tow, by way of wadding, over it. An old woman in the town where he
resided got her living by selling baked apples at a stall. While a young
friend, who acted in concert with him, was laying out a penny with
the dame, he contrived to introduce his firework under her cooking
apparatus, and to get away before it had time to explode, which in a
few minutes it did, to the destruction of her stock in trade, and great
bodily alarm. What was so peculiarly laughable in this bit of fun
was, the distress depicted in the countenance of the aged creature
at being deprived of her property, mingled with the expression of
extreme terror at so nearly having had her eyes blown out.
A juvenile wag, familiarly denominated by his associates Ned
Sparrow, diverted himself very cleverly at the cost of a certain cob-
bler, who, being deaf and severely afflicted with asthma, was a very
fit object of sport. Having first fastened up his door, he took a large
tobacco-pipe, with a hot coal and some brimstone in the bowl of
it, and poked its other end through Crispin's keyhole. Then, getting

an academical companion to hold it in its place, he proceeded, by
driving a stream of air through it, by means of a pair of bellows, to
fumigate the unlucky cobbler, whose cough soon began to afford
them high glee, and whose rage, when, half stifled, and endeavouring
to escape, he became aware of the trick that had been played him,
absolutely convulsed them with mirth; and when his cries had at
length brought some neighbours to his assistance, and he was enabled
to get out, he was almost black in the face, which was very funny to
behold. But the joke did not end here, for his complaint having
been aggravated, by inhaling the sulphurous fumes, into an inflam-
mation of the chest, he had to be leeched, and bled, and blistered
handsomely, and, indeed, was very near losing his life.
Master William, or, as the young gentleman was more commonly
called, Bill Grigg, formed, in a playful moment, a resolution to have
a “lark.” He therefore went out into the fields, and stole the largest
turnip he could find. Then, first he sliced off the top of it, and next
scooped out the inside, and cut three holes in front for eyes, nose, and
mouth. After this effort of constructiveness, he nailed a stick, with
an old glove affixed to either end of it, across a clothes-prop, on the
top of which he stuck the head that he had carved from the turnip,
ingeniously investing the body of the scarecrow with an old white
sheet. Under the veil of evening, he conveyed the thing to the
churchyard, and having previously fixed a lighted candle in the imi-
tation death's-head, hoisted it up behind a tombstone, at the turning
of a corner, where a passenger would come upon it suddenly. It
frightened the clergyman's daughter, who was returning from the
village to the parsonage house, into fits, and deprived her for a con-
siderable period of her reason. This made the reverend gentleman
and his wife nearly as mad as the young lady herself, and here was
the jest; but what tickled Master Grigg more than anything else,
was the idea of Miss Willoughby being obliged to have her head
shaved.
That singularly frolicsome lad, Master Charles Wells, whose de-
votion to Momus no flogging or “imposition” has been able te damp,
is in the habit of indulging in a pleasant piece of waggery, which has
already occasioned the breaking of various noses, to the extreme
titillation of his fancy. It consists in crouching on his hands and
knees, in front of doors, so that any one entering by them may tum-
ble over him. No doubt, he will some day have the gratification of
causing a fracture. All tumblers are ludicrous enough, but these are
more so than any ; they look so absurd and angry when they get up,
and rub themselves so ruefully; moreover, sometimes they swear, to
the hearer's great amusement.
Master Watkins is of a playful disposition. Jem, or, as his mama
requests he may be called, James, has a commendable antipathy to
diligence and application, which extends to such young gentlemen of
his acquaintance as are prone to be guilty thereof. It is a favourite
amusement of his to insert, beneath the collar of the absorbed and
anxious student, a paper pig-tail, the end of which he slyly ignites.
The head of the good young scholar is, of course, presently in a blaze,
and he starts and cries out with fright and pain; whereat the merri-
ment which is excited is great. Our young friend also often delights
himself and others by inking the seat of any schoolfellow who may
happen to be wearing nice clean nankeen trousers; which piece of
wit he is especially tempted to practise on subjects who are remark-
able for order and cleanliness. He sometimes sticks shoemaker's
wax to even the master's stool ; and once handed to one of the ushers
who had a knack of biting his writing implements, a pen which he
had filled with mustard. IIe says that he likes playing these tricks,
because they make people so “wild.”
Tying a furze-bush to the tail of a donkey, and then setting it on
fire; attaching to the same part of an individual of the canine race, a
tin pot; shoeing a cat with walnut-shells, and placing her upon ice ;
and spinning a chafer on a pin, are other amusements of a kindred
character with the above; and to youths who are humorously in-
clined, the antics and cries of the creatures who are made to furnish
them, afford a rich treat.
The foregoing jokes are barbarous, to be sure; but so are all early
attempts. We may as well, perhaps, warn any young friends who
may feel disposed to crack them, that they must be prepared for re-
taliation, and must expect to smart occasionally for their smartness.
They will now and then, in the common course of things, procure
for themselves a cuffing, or a flagellation ; and may chance, in conse-
quence of some particularly sharp sally, be sent to the treadmill.
But let them reflect, that they will still be administering to the
amusement of their friends, who will laugh as heartily at their suffer-
ings, as they have been accustomed to do at other people's ; and, in
particular, that should they, as witty rogues phrase it, ever “get
three months,” they will afford atheme for mirth, which will inst for -
the remainder of their lives.

A common—flat as a plate, and green as an emerald.
Very right; and what—there, upon your left—what do you behold?
A goose; yea, a solitary grey goose.
'Tis very true. Uncover to it. Yes; off with your hat ; for we
tell you, that goose—and great are the gains to humanity by the
usurpation—that goose hath dethroned the eagle; yes, knocked the
flesh-eating bird from its perch of bloody state, and now, serenely
gaggles in its place. Yet is there no pride in the goose. Observe it;
mark its movements. How gently it waddles ; how its neck undu-
lates like a snake; and now with what a meek sagacity it lays its
head on one side, and gazes on you with its small grey eye. Reader,
you have a sceptic look; you do not believe in the dethronement of
the carnivorous emperor Aquila, and the accession of good king Anser.
No ; we at once interpret your emotions, as with downward gaze you
contemplate the bird of benevolence—for so it is—nibbling the com-
mon at your foot. We detect your sensual littleness. Already have
you spitted that goose in thought ; already a dream of pungent onion,
aromatic sage, steals upon your sense—a dream, not all unmixed with
apples—savoury sauce | Yes, you are incredulous of the power of
the goose over the eagle, for you see not its more potent weapons—
its more tremendous thunderbolts 1
Thunderbolts | A goose carry thunderbolts 1
Look here, for you see we have caught the goose, and for all its
uproar and struggling we will convince you of its marvellous power.
Now what is this—what are these ?
Why, that is its wing; and what should these be but its quills
Right; the weapons of peace—the pacific thunderbolts that have
well nigh killed the warlike eagle; and in due season, will leave it
not a feather to fly with. Are you not a convert Feel you not a
new-born respect for the goose? Are not the standards of Caesar but
as the plaything of an ogre, compared to—
“The might that slumbers in a goose's wing?”
Be converted to the new, the strengthening faith; and, looking
upon eagles as the idols of a false religion—as no more than the
ibises of old Egypt—respect and venerate the goose.

PUNCH'S PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS.
AN ACT FOR THE RELIEF OF GENTLEMANLY INSOLVENT DEBTORS.
A Most salutary bill was brought in by our clever and noble rela-
tive Lord Punch late last session, and hastily run through all its
stages, which will have the desirable effect of greatly conveniencing
gentlemen spendthrifts, and of enabling them to defraud their cre-
ditors, as in justice and equity they ought to do, without the slightest
risk of being personally annoyed in return. We cannot too highly
compliment my Lord Punch upon the foresight which made him keep
back this erquisite bill until the eleventh hour of a long session,
when almost anything would have passed without remark, and
when those lawyers who would have op- and ex-posed it were
all away on Circuit. The bill having passed, and having become
a part of the law of the land, it is our duty, as public and Punchy
journalists, to let our readers (the world) know its purport. The
preamble recites that “Whereas it has been wisely laid down by
Sheridan in the ‘School for Scandal’—(no mean authority upon
matters of debtor and creditor)—that “Tradesmen are the most
exorbitant fellows, and paying them is only encouraging
them;’” and that “Whereas divers and sundry of Her Majesty's
most agreeable, facetious, and dandy subjects are well content to run
out of their fortunes and into debt, but yet are by no means desirous
to suffer, nor is it genteel that they should suffer, the annoyance and
vulgarity of imprisonment;” and that “Whereas it is expedient that
the legislature of an enlightened country should throw every elegant
protection around such persons :” Be it therefore enacted, by and
with the advice and assistance of two or three of the dandies most
interested in the matter, in conclave assembled, that all such parts
of all such acts of parliament now in force, as can be in any way con-
strued so as to be in the smallest degree distasteful to the said recited
dandies, shall be and they are hereby repealed.
MEMBERs or Thr, hirie class.
Clause I. then provides, that the word “prison” shall never again
be pronounced in the hearing of the said dandies, or any one of them;
nor be introduced into any written document relating to them, or any
one of them.
CLAuse II. provides, that if at any time any one of such dandies
shall owe money which he is either unable or unwilling to pay, and
any creditor of any such dandy shall so far forget himself as to ask
for payment of his account, it shall and may be lawful for such dandy
as aforesaid, in the first instance, and without notice, legal or other-
wise, served on such creditor, to kick such creditor down stairs, pro-
vided such application shall have been made in such part of such
dandy's residence as will admit of his conveniently so doing : but if
such application shall have been made on the ground floor, then and
in that case it shall be lawful for such dandy to kick such creditor
so applying into the street or garden, as the case may be.
CLAusE III. provides, that upon reasonable proof that any such
demand for payment has been made upon any such dandy, and that
such dandy is unable or unwilling as aforesaid—which reasonable
proof shall be taken to mean nothing beyond the assertion of such
dandy of such demand having been made, and of his inability or
unwillingness to pay—it shall and may be lawful for any such dandy,
in the first instance, to call for his dressing-gown, slippers, Persian
cap, and hooker; and having obtained them, to recline his body on a
sofa, and his feet on an ottoman, and then and there to smoke; that
while so employed, he shall despatch a messenger to one of the judges
of the Court of Bankruptcy (which messenger shall be paid by the
creditor who made the application) with a note written on gilt-edged
and perfumed paper, setting forth the annoyance to which he has
been subjected, and requiring such judge's immediate attendance.
Clause IV. makes it imperative upon such judge so summoned,

to give his immediate attendance at the residence of such dandy, and
to bring with him a protection for such dandy from all arrest or other
possible molestation of his person; also, a blank schedule, which he,
the said judge, shall fill up on the spot with such statement of the
debts and credits of such dandy as it may suit such dandy to furnish.
That having done this, and having handed the protection as aforesaid
to the groom of the chambers of such dandy, he, the said judge, shall
invite such dandy to a champagne luncheon on the day appointed
for his hearing, and then respectfully take his leave.
Claus E. V. enjoins such judge to take care that on the day of
hearing no unnecessary delays take place, and that no unpleasant
questions are put to the quasi bankrupt ; but that with all possible
dispatch he shall be declared entitled to the benefit of this most
gentlemanly act, and have future liberty of his person, and take
future liberties with his tradesmen.
Clause V.I. merely provides that the after-acquired property of
such dandy shall be reserved for his own sole and separate use; in-
sisting, however, that he shall give up all his property of whatever
description, real and personal, in possession, reversion, remainder, or
picture by (Raffle) Raphael.
expectancy, for the benefit of his creditors, at the time of his being
so declared entitled to the benefit of this most gentlemanly act, as
aforesaid—if he likes it—“anything herein contained to the contrary
thereof in any wise notwithstanding.”

No. VI.--THE SONG OF THE POPPY.
I'm a thundering poppy gaudy and gay,
I'm rollicking and red,
And in the corn-fields all the day
I lazily nod my head.
I'm not like the daisy, that closes its eye
When the shades of evening creep;
No, the poppy can openly stare at the sky
While all around it sleep.
'Tis true that my leaves in one brief hour
Are scatter'd, stripp'd, and torn ;
That a strong north wind, or a heavy shower,
Will leave mystem forlorn.
But who would survive affliction's day,
When tears around us flow;
Though “yes” every other flower should say,
The poppy would answer “no.”
They sneer because I’m void of scent,
And can't compare with the rose;
To please the eye the poppy's content,
Let others delight the nose.
And what does odour at last avail,
When the woodbine's fate we see?
Confined to a wall with cloth and nail,
While the scentless poppy is free
It will have been observed by our readers that two lunatics have re-
cently escaped from Bethlehem. One was fortunately found ; but it is

THE CONCLUSION OF MR. MUFFS LECTURE.
WHETHER it was that the subject was more entertaining, or that
the circumstance of allowing pipes and beer during the oration made
it more attractive, we cannot exactly state; but decidedly Mr. Muff
got a better audience than the professors of the school. Not only the
old pupils attended, but all the new men also ; who, according to the
habits of their class in general, brought their note-books with them,
and put down everything he said.
He had a famous trumpeter in Jack Randall, who was becoming
more popular amongst the students every day, from his great love of
fun, and diverting mischievous propensities.
practising the cornet-à-piston regularly in the dissecting-room at one
o'clock, having installed that quiet instrument in his locker on pur-
pose that it might be always handy.
He had much increased the feeling of veneration towards him, pre-
valent amongst his companions, by an answer he made to Dr. Wur-
zel, who one day inquiring, half in joke, half in earnest, what he
was about, received for a reply, “that he was trying to set Cooper's
Surgical Dictionary to music, for performance at the Oxford-street
theatre when it opened.”
“I think,” said Randall, seeing the Professor somewhat flustered,
“ that much good may be done in this way. I propose opening a
medical theatre, where the performances shall be such as may amuse
the students, and instruct them at the same time. I would open with
‘Concussion, a tragedy in five acts, to be followed by the ‘St. Vitus's
Quadrilles ;' after which a farce entitled ‘Smoke and Toothach ;"
the whole to conclude with a grand pantomime of action, entitled
“The Imp of Epilepsy, or Harlequin and Delirium Tremens.’ I think
the proposition a good one, which the Lyceum ought to jump at.”
There is a tradition, also, that the matron of the hospital offended
him by some severe remarks she made, in consequence of having
overseen him taking hot potatoes for lunch from the trays which were
FOUR-HANDED cruibbage.
going upstairs with the dinners for the patients; and subsequently
chucking the servant under the chin, and telling her that she was
prettier than her mistress. Whereupon Mr. Randall first stole a dead
monkey which had been bought cheap of a keeper at the Zoological
Gardens, to make a skeleton for the Museum of Comparative Anatomy.
Next, he painted it green, and having shut it up in a hat-box
which belonged to Mr. Widdy—a new man who was very particular
about his clothes—sent it by the Parcels' Delivery to the matron,
with the united compliments of the life governors and house apothe-
cary—the latter being a pious young man, who had lately published
a work about religion and kidneys. This waggish trick threw the
poor woman into a wonderful series of fits, which occupied all the
tender assiduity of the secretary for some hours—indeed there was
a slight suspicion that they had a matrimonial design against each
other.
Being suspected—and with some plausibility—of this frolic, every-
thing that occurred in the school, if particularly mischievous, was
placed to his account. And yet, with all this, if there was a prize
or honorary certificate to be contested for, Jack Randall always
got it, although not a soul ever saw him reading. The profes-
sors could not help this, although they would sooner have bestowed
their rewards upon the good young men who “minded their books,”
—the sober students with black frock-coats and thin legs, who put-
tered after them round the wards, like ducks going to a pond, with
stethescopes in their hands, and big books under their arms to look
learned.
Previously to Mr. Muff's again commencing his lecture, Randall
went round and beat up all the pupils he could find ; and then coax-
ing the old men, and frightening the new ones into subscribers, laid in
the usual quantity of Barclay's barley-water, (as he termed the
commingled), and then told Muff to begin; whereupon that talented
individual commenced as follows:–
“Gentlemen,

tions of the studies you have come up here to pursue, or which your
friends think you have—being all the same thing, provided they have

your education, and I am sure you will feel wonderfully better after
them.
Private lessons in practical chemistry you will find very advan-
tageous, if they only enable you to watch the evaporation of nothing
from watch-glasses on hot sand, or discover arsenic in stomachs
where it is not. I had a course of private instruction myself; when
it was finished, I could blow a glass jug almost as well as the man at
the Adelaide Gallery, and poison a sparrow with chlorine gas in a
manner marvellous to behold. All this must be learned to enable
you to pass; but when that triumph is achieved, burn your notes, sell
your books, and buy a grave morning-gown ; and a brass door-plate ;

a night-bell that can be heard all over the street; get some convivial
friend, whose habits lead him to be about at unreasonable hours, to
give it occasionally a good pull. If they sold potted assurance
as they do shrimps and bloaters, you would do well to lay in a
good stock: but as it is an article usually manufactured at home,
take a few lessons in getting it up, from the leading members of
your profession, and become great, even amongst the Tritons. But
even then do not relax in your endeavours to insure a good practice ;
but recollect, it is far more difficult to keep a position than to attain
one.
Whether you dissect or not, always tell your friends in the coun-
try that you do ; and then, when the tin runs short, you can often
draw upon them for the price of an extremity, varying it as occasion
may require. You will not find that minute knowledge of anatomy
which you are expected to acquire of any use to you. Great acci-
dents, in London, always go to hospitals; and in the country, are
always sent up to London.
Above all, never get off your beer. The archives of Apothecaries'
Hall do not present one instance of a man being rejected who stood
a pot of half-and-half when he was asked. And, in commencing life,
do not be discouraged ; for starting a practice is very like kindling a
fire in a Dr. Arnott's stove—the chief difficulty is to begin. And,
with all the assurance I wish you to possess, do not be too anxious to
be thought brilliant. Dulness and wealth, poverty and genius, are
each to each synonymous. No man ever yet rode in his carriage who
wrote a poem for his livelihood; and we may estimate talents of in-
tellect in an inverse ratio to talents of gold; namely, that whichever
way you take them, as one predominates, the other sinks.
In conclusion, I beg to drink all your good healths, and the perpe-
tual indisposition of your patients—if ever you get any.

We have heard whispers of a new work of a very eccentric character,
and of startling interest. It is to be called “Life and Remains of a
Welsh Rabbit.” The author, it is supposed, would not have undertaken
so arduous a task, had he not felt himself to be what is technically called
“The Cheese” in every particular.
The accomplished author of the unpublished sonnet alluded to in a
recent number of our work, has been circulating in private circles a pun
of much brilliancy. When it assumes a paragraphic shape, we shall per-
haps be enabled to lay it before our readers. We may, however, go so
far as to say that it involves a Jeu de Mor of a most ingenious character.

JUVENILE BIOGRAPHY.
No. III.-PETER PIPER.
PETER PIPER.—The subject of our present biography was a person
of strong mind, but eccentric habits, and presents an extraordinary
instance of what may be achieved by perseverance, however misap-
plied, for while Hannibal has cut his name upon the Alps, and Napo-
leon has signed the Simplon with his initials (N.B. or Nota Benc,
which when Buonaparte is in question must always be the result)—
while we say one great man has done this, and another great man
the other ; Peter Piper has chosen a peck of Pepper as the imaginary
pyramid that forms his monument.
In the columns of the Biographie Universelle, we find mention of t. :
certain Piper né dans une condition obscure, who afterwards raised
himself to the post of Swedish minister. This was not Peter who
picked the Pepper, though there is another Piper whom we find
lengthily treated of in Chalmers, as a humourist of excellent wit,
and there is no doubt he was one of those “ryghte merrie and welle
A
not woult it. A rºus in.
conceited varlettes” that we now and then find mentioned in the
Elizabethan Chronicles. But still, we have a difficulty in fixing the
picking of the pepper, even upon this “myghtie pleasaunte wagge;”
and we are thrown as usual upon the resources of conjectures, aided
by the “oulde balladde” for all the particulars that can be relied on
of our hero's history.
The age at which Peter Piper accomplished the task that has put his
name into the mouths of old and young, has never been even guessed
at by the scholiasts, most of whom were not backward in hazarding
conjectures of the vaguest sort upon every subject they treated of.
In the writings of the old schoolmen we have searched in vain, and
though Mr. Catnach has invited us to the perusal of his literary
treasures, we have declined availing ourselves of an offer that could
only lead to further bewilderment. That “Peter Piper picked a
peck of pepper,” is plainly enough indicated in the first line of the
ballad that is left to us, and we are therefore at a loss to account for
the ungenerous doubt conveyed in the second line, where it is
insidiously asked, “Did Peter Piper pick a peck of pepper ?”
If the questioning had stopped here, we might perhaps have been
satisfied with answering the second line by a reference to the first,
but the bard insidiously carries us on, from affirmation to doubt,
from doubt to investigation, and from investigation to a painful sus-
picion that the pepper was not picked as we had at first been led to
suppose it was. “If Peter Piper,” continues the crafty chronicler,
“picked a peck of pepper-Where,” cries the poet, rising in his
malice to a height of critical acumen that is almost sublime—“Where
is the peck of pepper that Peter Piper picked ” Echo might well
answer, “Where,” to such a cruelly subtle query, but are we to set
down Peter as an impostor because the peck of pepper is not forth-
coming, on the picking of which rests the foundation of his celebrity
As well might we throw doubt on the story of Columbus and the
egg, by asking “Where is the egg f" or deny to Ramo Samee the
credit of having swallowed a stone, by obstinately insisting on
its production. Are we not to believe that Wellington routed the
foe, until we have asked where is the enemy, or shall we refuse
to give credence to the story of Regulus and the spikes, because we
have not now before us the identical beer-barrel “Where is the peck
of pepper?” indeed Our blood boils as we write down a query so
insulting to a great man's memory, for great indeed was he, who
could pick a peck of pepper as Peter Piper did.
We should imagine that our hero had been in his lifetime a man

of wealth, for his name is mixed up almost to a proverb with transac-
tions of a pecuniary character. We have all heard of having to “pay
the piper,” and the allusion to a certain old custom of “borrowing of
Peter to pay Paul,” shows that Peter at least had the necessary funds
to render such a loan possible. If the Peter here alluded to was
Peter Piper—which, if everybody paid the piper, was not at all impro-
bable, the subject of our biography must have been one of the
wealthiest men, not only of his own, but of any other aera.

THE DECREASE IN THE REVENUE
HAs been a general matter of surprise, and various reasons have
been assigned to account for the unexpected deficiency of £434,831.
In order to set the public mind at rest upon a point of such im-
portance as the ways and means of this great kingdom, we have
determined to lay aside everything like false delicacy ; and, though
it may subject us to something like animadversion, we have re-
solved to make any sacrifice to relieve an anxiety that must be
doubly painful, from the unexpected cause which has occasioned
it—a cause, it is true, that the next quarter will remove, but
which, in the interim, cannot fail to be prejudicial, in some
slight degree, to the commercial and financial reputation of this
country, which, unfortunately, from a combination of adverse circum-
stances, has of late years been upon the decline. We trust, however,
that what we are about to state will have the effect of replacing
England on that proud pre-eminence which our own thoughtlessness
has endangered—the decrease in the anticipated amount of this
quarter's revenue arises solely from the fact that Punch has not paid
his Income Tax.

PUNCHPS LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER XIV-THE EVIL OF SENSIBILITY-STORY OF THE BANKER'S
CLERK.
A MAN who would thrive in the world, has no such enemy as what
is known by the term—sensibility. It is to walk barefooted in a
mob : at every other step your toes are crushed by the iron-shod
shoon of crowding vagabonds, who grin from ear to ear at the wry
faces you make, at the cries that may escape you. “Why didn't you
stay at home?” asks one; “Put your toes in your pocket,” counsels
another; quite unconscious of the deep philosophy enriching his
advice. Yes, my son; difficult as it may appear, the only thing for
the man to do—that is, the poor man born with sensibility—is to put
his toes into his pocket; in plain words, to smother his sensibility in
the place where he hopes some day to carry his money.
Many are the martyrs, my son, whose lives will never be penned.
Many the victims who, in garrets and in cellars, have vindicated
what is called the heroism of human nature, and by the awful mag-
nanimity of suffering, given assurance of the ethereal temper of the
human spirit. ... How many, even with earthly famine whitening their
lips, have smiled in lovely patience, thinking of immortal tables 1
How many, in the tatters of beggary, reeking in the nostrils of their
fellow-man, have apparelled themselves for God The looks of

STEPHEN GLADston E—for that shall be his name—in his 17th
year, was placed at a banker's desk. His gentleness, his almost
feminine tenderness of manner, made him the favourite of all who
knew him. He was endowed with a most fatal sensibility. His
cheeks would redden at the sudden accost of a stranger; and when
his employer, as would often happen, spoke in commendation of his
labours, the tears would gush from his eyes, and he would tremble
from head to foot, like a detected culprit. For three years Stephen
remained in the employ of Messrs. ; and every year, such
was his assiduity, such his exemplary conduct, his salary was in-
creased. Already the oldest clerks began to predict that “Stephen
Gladstone would soon be a junior partner.”
When Stephen had attained his twentieth year, a sudden alteration
was visible in his features—his manner. Day by day, he became
haggard—care-worn. His face was pale and juiceless; and his eyes,
ordinarily dull and filmed, would suddenly flash with lustrous
brightness. The slightest sound would make him start as at a
thunder-crash. His employers speedily noticed the change; and
again and again desired Stephen to forego his duties for a month or
two, to have change of air and scene; but every such desire seemed
to inflict inexpressible torture upon the clerk. He would declare he
was very well; if he looked ill, he knew not why he should do so,
for he was in excellent health ; never—never better. And still
day by day he seemed to waste and wither; and day by day the
weight upon his spirits grew heavier.
At length, Stephen's employers resolved to address themselves to
a physician; who, having heard their story, managed to obtain what
seemed an accidental meeting with the clerk.
“Why, Mr. Gladstone, you are not well. Come, come ! I see what
this is.”
“Indeed, sir, you mistake: I am well—quite well. Surely, sir, I
should know best,” said Stephen, a little irritated.
“Never tell me,” said the physician, whose cordial tone and bene-
volent manner would have gained the confidence of a misanthrope;
“I see your case plainly; it's love—nothing but love.”
Stephen looked a look of misery in the physician's face, suppressed
a groan, and broke from him.
| A week elapsed, and Stephen suddenly appeared before the doctor.
| His face was distorted with anguish; he reeled, and fell into a chair;
and sat gasping with the brain's agony. Instantly, the physician was
at his side—soothing, comforting him.
“I can endure it no longer: you shall know all, doctor—all, though
the hangman be at the door. Listen you know not, for these six
| months, what scorpions have been stinging me. To-day again—this
very day—my employers raised my income : they reward me—me !
Doctor, look at that hand! It is a thief's—I tell you it is a thief's
| But I said you should know all. My masters—kind souls I have
praised me for my zeal—have desired me to seek recreation—to
| absent myself from the house ! Oh, God! late and early I was at
the desk; it was that my books might escape detection! And they
call this zeal, and they reward me for it—me, who have robbed, have
pillaged them.”
Long and kind was the speech of the physician, who at length
charged himself to break the business to the masters of the wretched
youth, and with heavy heart departed on his mission. His tale was
soon told.
“Ha! haſ haſ Impossible,” cried the bankers. “ Gladstone em-
bezzle money ! why, he couldn't take a farthing—not a farthing: all
his books have been regularly balanced.” It was indeed so. His
morbid sensibility, worked upon by the possibility of the act, had, in
his own sickly terrors, made him a criminal.
“This is a mistake, quite a mistake :” and the physician sought to
soothe the mind of the excited clerk.
“Then I am no thief?” asked Stephen, as if awakened from a horrid
trance.

physician.
The discovery of his innocence was, however, too much for the

THE LOVE ASSURANCE SOCIETY.
INTRODUCTION.
Whilst all the daily papers teem with stories of starvation,
The corn-laws, chartists, income-tax, and general stagnation ;
And each one strives to show the world how very bad all trade is,
Mot one has ventured to take up the cause of the “ young ladies,”
Their case they state as desperate—the young men seem demented,
And with a bachelor's estate are horridly contented;
So since this anti-marriage whim now passes all endurance
They've plann'd a ladies' union, to form a Love Assurance,
Buy buy, buy buy, buy buy' who'll buy some shares?
desprit atrº ball, Y.
airt
The committee have found that the gentlemen's offers
Are usually ruled by the state of their coffers;
And though, in rare cases, a few pretty girls,
With naught but their bright eyes and dark silky curls
Have gone off at once, like a dry Congreve match,
Yet with most of the others the flame will not catch ;
But in spite of all efforts refuses to light,
Like a Catherine Wheel on a very wet night.
The rules they have made are drawn up with much care,
And nought is left out that the beaux can ensnare :
They can boast—to o'ercome this sad state of affairs,
A flourishing capital, raised by the shares;
With adequate portions each class to enhance
The most desperate spinster may still have a chance,
As some fierce half-pay captains are settled with pensions,
To bluster, and ask timid youths their intentions.
These qualifications the first class demands,
Dark eyes, chesnut hair, figure good, and small hands.
Her features expressive—a brilliant complexion-
With a perfect tournure—little feet no objection.
She must waltz—and (of course) have an exquisite waist-
sing and play, when she's asked, with professional taste.
The suitor in this case must look for no help,
Such a belle “is a fortune you know in herself."
Class two—rather plain, both in figure and face,
But of course “very amiable,”—always the case.
As attractions are few, and inducements not great,
The portion assigned to this class is first rate.
She can play some quadrilles—they're a rather old set;
And remembers one waltz, from the air of “We Met.”
And deeming her voice more expressive than strong,
Has been known, with much pressing, to chirp a faint song.
Class Three—plainer still: every plan has essay'd,
Yet not much inclining to die an old maid,
Is waiting to see how the next system acts,
Of teaching the poor, and distributing tracts.
Her temper “so so"—thinks waltzing not right,'
But four hundred a year may some suitors invite.
wears her hair in plain bands tightly pull'd round her head,
To look intellectual—the colour is-auburn 1
Horticultural fêtes will be given in shoals,
With archery meetings, and balls for the Poles
In fact, every species of man-trap e'er known,
Will be set, for the use of subscribers alone.
Then, fair ones, no longer give way to despair,
But rush to our office, and purchase a share,
Or Hymen, a bankrupt, will sell off his chains,
And husbands be class'd as organic remains /
THE THEATRICAL ORACLE. .
We were exceedingly gratified by purchasing a number of a work bearing
something like the above title, published on the 15th inst., partly on account
of the delight we felt at the beauty of the style, and the bold disregard
of all those grammatical rules to which we have hitherto so slavishly
adhered ; and still more, because it was a clue leading us to the rightful
owner of a MS. lately discovered by us in the neighbourhood of the Cat
and Mutton, and which could not be the work of any other than the inde-
pendent and original genius who conducts the powerful dramatic organ just
referred to. -
Let our readers judge for themselves. The following is an extract
from “The Theatrical Oracle,” and alludes to the reception of Madame
Westris and Mr. C. Mathews at Drury Lane:–
“Their reception was enthusiastic and vehement, and relieved from
their recent managerial cares, gave a force to their acting, and a buoy-
ancy to the animal spirits that are nightly imparted to the crowded
audiences who lavish their applause on their spirited exertions in return.
Madame Westris's superb soprano tones are richly circulated in no less
than three ballads that are warmly welcomed by her admirers, and dis-
arms the severe critic and cynic by her inimitable archness and bewitch-
ing grace of manners. The Follies of a Night is an adaption from the
French, and is one of those bustling pieces of intrigue for which the
French vaudevillists are so justly celebrated. To map down its plot would
be as difficult as tedious ; its incidents rise in rapid succession, and are as
difficult to retain as the light flashes of a sunbeam. Sufficeth it, then,
that Charles Mathews is a young provincial coxcomb and fortune-hunter.
Madame Westris the charming representative of the Duchess, in which
she develops the grace and vivacity of the French stage, which is so
justly eminent for reflecting the habits and piquant elegance of the
drawing-room. Hudson and Compton also display the talents of genuine
comedians. The scenery is extremely beautiful; and altogether, a very
pleasant entertainment has been afforded. It has been the running after-
piece from its first night, and promises to be an especial favourite for a
long time to come.”
We cannot omit another little extract from a notice of Semiramide :-
“Of the gems of this sublime opera we must particularly direct atten-
tion to Mrs. Alfred Shaw's manner and divinely expressive way of singing
her Cavatina, ‘Ah ! that day. I well remember,” where her sublime
contralto, controlled by the most scientific skill, and whose soft diapason
tones fall like seraphs’ harmony and penetrate the heart with chastening
ardour and inspiring effect. Again the contralto and soprano duet, “Dark
day of sorrow,' between Miss Kemble and Mrs. Shaw ; what deep pathos
what eloquence discoursing ! Mark the clear brilliant towering sublimity
of expression as Semiramide holds on the C in alt., while the thirds and
fifths of Assaca's deep mellow notes from D to G in a full octave and a
half are filling in a sublime harmony of melody of the most touching and
refined order.”
The following is our MS., and who but the author of the above could
have written it —
« ARCADIAN SALOON.”
“This beautifully fitted-up concern, which is nightly resorted to, by
fashionable amusement, and respectable householders, and where the
charms of a fragrant cigar and beautiful spirits is completely overthrown
by the sweet º of Miss Miggs. is now open. The beautiful notes
of this young lady, which strike our ear at least an octave and a half, as
well as her force, which was educated in Italy, gives a new richness an
volume to the sublime creations of Donizetti's muse, as well as to the
applause of the audience, who returns it accordingly. He (Mr. Snibbs) dii
perfectly right in engaging so much talent, when there is so little which
must realize a fortune, and thus doubtless their coffers will be filled, without
flattery, which the austere critic says is to be avoided. Her voice
reminds us of the action of Mad. Catalani, which, we regret to say, we
never heard. Notwithstanding which, we advise all our readers to go to
the Arcadian Saloon, where he will find a pleasant retreat for his care-
worn countenance.”
WE read in the Times, October 18th—
“Mr. Hill, of Draycott, aged 90, rode to Chaf-
ford fair, on his mare, aged 36. The united
ages of the two amounted to 126 1"
There must be some mistake here.
Some curiosity has been manifested to know how the servants in attend-
ance on the Queen were paid during the royal progress to Scotland. We
are authorised to state, that the suite while on board were on board
wages.
"I'll let you know when I come back again"—as the rheumatism said to the leg.
“I am certainly dun"—as the celebrated cow said to Guy, Earl of Warwiek
Have you improved in riding 2—not exactly ; I have fallen off a great deal lately.
“We part to meet again"—as the Field-lane Jew said to the Bandana.

PUNCH'S COMIC MYTHOLOGY.
II.--THE JUDGM Ent OF PAR is.
AIREST my brandy flask.”
“Where is the ‘meet to be this morning,
love?” enquired OEnone of her husband as
he buckled on his hunting sandals.
“At the Idalian cover in the royal preserves,”
replied Paris. “I hope we shall have some
sport, as I promised the governor a haunch.
By the bye, did he call yesterday with the cash
for those beasts he bought of us?”
“He came ; but left a message stating that
he had transferred the amount to your account
with the governor and company of the Trojan
Bank.”
“All right. Good bye, darling !” By this
time Paris was at the door with his hand on the
bridle.
“Good bye, dearest,” returned the wife reluc-
tantly. “But,”—she continued, following the
young farmer very closely—“but, is that all f"
Paris turned with the suddenness of a person
detected in an unpardonable piece of forgetfulness.
He dropped the bridle and kissed OEnone with all
his might, she returned the salute with rustic
empressement. With this exhibition of unfashionable fondness, they
separated.
Determined to bring his nag down to cover fresh and eager for
his work, Paris descended Mount Ida leisurely, and could not help
pulling up to admire the ox he was fattening for the royal Trojan
cattle show, which was to come off in the spring. As he surveyed the
fine proportions, and well distributed fat which lined the sides of the
beast, he all at once became aware that he was not the only specta-
tor. An individual appeared as if by magic, leaning over the fence,
and viewing with intense admiration the well-bred bull. By a kind
of involuntary fascination, Paris kept his eyes riveted on the stranger,
who had all the appearance of a Greek, with the jaunty careless air
of a man about town from Athens. His costume was slightly eccen-
tric. . His hat had a bowl crown with a broad brim, pleasantly con-
trived to appear turned up at the sides like a pair of wings. His
tunic was short and looped at the shoulders; to his sandals a pair of
spurs of pure gold were attached, also shaped like pinions. He
flourished, with the adroitness of a confirmed petit-maître, a walking
stick fantastically betwisted with a couple of withy branches carved
in the semblance of serpents.”
On entering into conversation with him, Paris found him a com-
plete connoisseur in cattle.
“Ah,” exclaimed the stranger, “the owner of that bull is as lucky
a master-shepherd as ever flourished a crook.”
“ Unlucky you mean,” retorted Paris. “The brute belongs to me.”
“Ha, ha, you speak of the past, I of the future. But that I may be
the better judge of your former luck, good, bad, or indifferent, suppose
you tip us your history, old fellow,” rejoined the individual, play-
fully poking the horseman in the ribs with his strange-looking
stick.
At the touch of this walking-cane, Paris felt imbued with a strong
friendship for and confidence in the stranger. He sprang from his
horse, tied it up to the gate, and shook his companion heartily by the
hand; declaring himself delighted to comply with the request. As
to the hunt, that might go to Styx for what he cared—he should
cut it.
Feeling himself somehow inoculated with considerable dignity,
and determined to astonish the stranger by the extent and classicality
of his education, he delivered himself in blank verse, thus:–
“My name is Paris; on the Idalian hill
My gov'nor pens his sheep—a thrifty swain,
Whose constant cares were to get all he could—
To keep whate'er he got, and me, a shepherd.
But I had heard of hunting—and I longed
To follow to the field some sporting squire –
The gods soon granted what my gov. denied.
One night a band of gristly wolves rushed like a torrent
* See Intaglio of Mercury, by Dioscorides, figured in Keightley's Ancient Mytho-
iogy, pl. vi. No. 3.
On our bleating sheep.
Frightened them away !“
Returning home in triumph, I disdained
The shepherd's weekly wage, and went
In business for myself—can now go hunting
When I like. My governor——.”
I alone with pipe and tabor
“You frequently mention your governor,” interrupted the auditor,
“but do you happen to know who your father was 1”
“I regret to say I am not so wise a child. The old man who
brought me up, tells a cock and bull story about child-dropping, and
iny being found by him, wet-nursed by a bear.”
Upon this, the lively stranger crossed his legs, and leaning against
his stick, looked Paris steadfastly in the face for some minutes. “I)on't
be alarmed,” he said at length, “but I'm going to astonish you !"
“Are you? Only tell me that I am the indiscretion of some noble-
man, or member of parliament, and I’ll embrace you.”
“I could a tale unfold,” was the reply, “but upon that, I must for
the present be silent. The fact is, if you will borrow it, I can lend
you a talisman by which, eventually, you will discover your birth and
parentage.” Upon this the stranger drew from under his robes a
golden apple, placed it in Paris's hand and disappeared.
Now, if up to that moment there was a good natured, contented,
devil-may-care fellow in the kingdom of Troas, it was Paris. But
now he felt querulous and ill-tempered. As his views became sud-
denly expanded, he looked upon himself as an injured man—no
doubt he was the offspring of some country-gentleman in easy
circumstances. Why then should fate have made him a second-
rate grazier He felt exceedingly ill-tempered, and punished his
horse; which, in return, enlivened its canter back to the homestead
with a few spirited kicks. The moment he encountered his wife he
began to quarrel with her.
“Really, my love, you need not be so cross about it,” expostulated
the spouse, after stating that three ladies had been to see him.
“I merely said that they did not seem a whit better than they
should be.”
“Well, and what if they are not —you need not have sent them
away.”
“Pray do not let that distress you ; for see, they are returning.”
Paris looked through the window, and despite his ill humour, could
not help agreeing with his wife as to the appearance of his visitors.
They were as scantily clad as the chorus of a Greek opera, or the
choryphées at a feast of Bacchus.
“Well, madam : " shouted Paris, savagely, perceiving his wife still
remained in the room; “have you nothing to do in the dairy The
business of these ladies with me may be of a private nature.”
OEnone retired slowly, with that sobbed-out sentence about having
her “heart broken,” which married ladies when deprived of their
own way have in all ages felt bound to utter.
The moment the three ladies entered the room, Paris trembled
from head to foot, for he knew by instinct that he was in the
presence of deities. In spite of his awe, however, he felt mightily
inclined to quarrel with them. -
“We have come,” said the tallest of the figures, “for an apple in
your possession.”
“Do you mean to say I did not come by it honestly 1 ° inquired
the shepherd, seeing a good opening for a row, which he was dying
to have.
“By no means; all we wish is, that you would be good enough to
hand it to its proper owner.”
“A likely story. Why, it is pure gold : besides, by its aid I am to
find out a valuable secret ! You surely do not expect me to give it
up without a suitable reward ' "
Here all three ladies spoke at once, and the sounds they uttered
were, Paris thought, more delicious than he ever heard in his life;
for they embodied promises of the most extravagant good fortune.
One offered him a kingdom—the second, that she would place him at
the head of a powerful army, so that he might, if he pleased, conquer
an empire or two. The third claimant simpered, and declared that
he should have the loveliest woman upon earth +, if he would only
be good enough to give her her apple ; for if he would read the
inscription upon the article in dispute, he would soon see that she
was the rightful owner. The voice of this deity was so musical, her
smile so enchanting, her figure and face so beautiful, that Paris ex-
claimed, “What a lovely creature : " At this moment CEnone was
heard to upset a pan of cream in the dairy.
* From Paris's exploits with the wolves, he got the name of Alexander—helper
and defender,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Having read the inscription (“To the fairest”), Paris, boiling over
with causeless rage as he was, the moment he again touched the apple
of discord, determined to decide upon moral grounds. For it will
be readily observed, that people when in a passion pretend to extra-
vagant virtue. He cared not a fig, he observed, for a throne—not
he. Give him his pipe and his glass—provided the first were a
genuine meerschaum, and the latter filled with champagne—he was
content. As to a generalship, he would rather be without it;
fighting was not much to his taste. Finally, as a married man, he
dared not entertain the tempting offer of a divorce and a second
bride, however his inclinations might wrestle with his virtue. No,
he would decide the case upon its merits, and award the apple to
the loveliest woman mortal eyes had ever beheld.
He said, and kneeling, gave the apple to her who played “third lady”
in the drama. Venus seized the prize, and exultingly disappeared,
her companions vowing vengeance against the rustic judge. Paris
felt the serenity of his disposition return the moment he got rid of
the apple, but without, the elements became disturbed; thunder rent
the air. The house shook under him. CEnone declared the milk
had curdled, that the beer was turned sour, whilst a cowherd ran in
and announced that a party of horse-guards had just driven off the
prize bull by the order of the King of Troy.
Here, then, endeth the history of the apple of discord, and
beginneth that of the siege of Troy. The sequel whereof hath been
written in choice Italian by one Ovid ". How that the bull was
destined as the prize in a tournament given by King Priam for his
sons, as challengers against all comers—how that Paris resolved not
to be done out of his beast, but went into the ring and won. How he
was discovered to be the son of Priam and Hecuba. How that he
went to Sparta and eloped with the fairest woman upon earth, as
promised by Venus—no other than the celebrated Helen. How that
the friends of that young lady took up the matter warmly, and laid
hot siege to Troy—but for further particulars inquire of Homer's
Iliad.

THE ZOOLOGY AND ARCHITECTURE OF
LAWYERS’ CLERKS.
THE Lawyer's Clerk is zoologically speaking, one of the lower class
of animals; and if we follow the arrangement of Cuvier, who divides
the animal kingdom into vertebrata, articulata, mollusca, and
radiata, we think we can succeed in bringing the Lawyer's Clerk
partially within every one of the four sub-kingdoms alluded to. He
belongs to rertebrata by virtue of his backbone, which ought to be to-
lerably strong, when it is considered how heavy are the burdens put
upon it; he may also frequently be considered as coming under the
class articulata, the peculiarity of which consists in having the bones
outside (and the bones of many Lawyers' Clerks are almost coming
through their skin); while their claim to be sometimes regarded as
mollusca consists in their extraordinary softness; and they may be
said to partake in some degree of the radiata, for as this class often
obtain nourishment by absorption, so does the Lawyer's Clerk occa-
sionally obtain a dinner by standing near a cook's-shop, and absorb-
ing the steam from it.

There are almost as many orders of Lawyers' Clerks as there are
in architecture. There is the Corinthian, or London articled clerk ;
the Gothic, or provincial, who comes to finish his articles in a London
office; the rich Composite, who hopes to form a part of the firm, and
who is sometimes taken in as a pillar for the sake of his capital; and
(to say nothing of various intermediate orders) there is the Doric or
Daric, the clerk who opens the door by the old nursery contrivance,
“of pulling the bobbin that the latch may come up”—a process
which is very likely to end in walking into the jaws of the wolf, when
a client pays a visit to his lawyer.
PUNCH'S COURT CIRCULAR.
“Brighton, Wednesday.—There is no longer any doubt of Her Ma-
jesty's intention to visit Brighton at a very early period. Several extra
ands have been put on. One of the clerks of the kitchen arrived this
evening.”
The above paragraph, of course, excited the most intense curiosity in
the Metropolis, and Punch immediately sent down his own reporter to
learn the latest particulars. The following may be relied upon :
A new heater has been ordered for the royal urn, and the potato
steamer has been placed in the hands of an experienced tinman, who has
been instructed to spare no expense in soldering wherever it may be
required. The royal sweep has also arrived, and has had along interview
with the laundress, which terminated in his operating on the wash-house
flue with a quarter of an ounce of gunpowder.

chimnry on na Mirnts.
It is quite true that one of the clerks of the kitchen has arrived, and it
is also a fact, that the comptroller of the scullery has been for some days
upon the spot, and has presided at a review of the plates and dishes,
when he was pleased to express his approbation of the state in which he
found them.
Basting-spoon in ordinary has taken possession of his apartments, and
deputy-spit is expected down in a day or two. The clerk of the rolling-
pin is already superintending the details of his own department, and the
lord-high-skewer has sent down the necessary instructions to deputy-
assistant bottle-jack.
A JOHN BULLISM.
There is a mute attached to Kensal Green Cemetery that has so lost the faculty of
speech, that if any one was to offer him a pot of beer, he couldn't say “No” to it.

The
CHINESE EXHIBITION AT KNIGHTSBRIDGE.
T is well known to every English-
man who loves tea and his country,
that the East India Tea Company
have latterly got into hot water with
the Chinese, and that the memorable
O. P. row at the Theatre Royal, Co-
vent Garden, is likely to be eclipsed
by the O. P. urn row at the Imperial
Theatre of War, Canton. A line of
demarcation has been drawn, and
the Celestial soldiers are ordered to
fire upon the “Company” who come,
without being invited, to tea. In
other words, the line is to be strictly
guarded, and if the Company attempt
to cross their teas, the troops are to
dot their eyes with sugar-of-lead.
The Chinese themselves, who are
universally admitted to be nice men
for a small tea party, use no sugar—
and, judging from the above order, we should say very little milk-of
human kindness. The attempt to shoot their lead at us, although
they have not the courage to follow it up by a charge, has naturally
excited the anger of the great men of Leadenhall Street; and the
tea-dealers, on both sides, are trying which is the strongest. Which
side of the quarrel is the just one, it is beside our purpose to
inquire; but it is clear that, even if we are wrong, still we are
strong, and therefore, although our conduct may be black, theirs is
green. It is no consolation to us that they cut their own throats by
endeavouring to prevent their tea from cutting ours. We are used
to the beverage, and cannot submit to be deprived of our tea
totally. As long, therefore, as the war party, or rather tea party,
in China, think fit to keep up their fire, so long must we send
war-steamers with large boilers, and give them pound for pound.
These strange little people, many of whom are sorcerers, are said to
fight best in their cups. Be that as it may, our sea-chests hold as good
gunpowder as their tea-chests; and we make no doubt that our
sailors and soldiers will see all properly served out. To them, there-
fore, we commit the management of the mess. With these few in-
troductory remarks we take, for the present, our (tea) leaves of the
Chinese in their own country, and request our readers to accompany
us to a most interesting exhibition now open at Knightsbridge, of
which we will endeavour to give them some account. Passing through
this populous suburb the other day in an omnibus, our head filled
with conundrums, de omnibus rebus, &c., we espied a Chinese-looking
building which suited our fancy to a T, and observing a number of
people pouring out, we called to the caddy to stop, trusting that we
should not be looked upon as a spoon if we put in and helped to fill up.
Almost the first thing which strikes the intelligent visitor on enter-
ing the building (and, indeed, the dullest cannot fail to observe it,
for the proprietor, regardless of expense, has placed a person there to
make them), is the absolute necessity of paying half-a-crown before
you go any further. This done, the incredibly small additional sum
of one shilling entitles you to be accompanied round the gallery (and
home afterwards if you like it) by one hundred and fifty pages! each
charged with an explanation either of the
History of cHINA,
or of some portion of this exhibition. Well, indeed, may the
PopU LATION OF CHINA
consist of “three hundred and sixty millions of human beings,”
when one hundred and fifty pages can be spared to accompany each
visitor round a mere Chinese exhibition; and well may such pages
present but a small type of so numerous a people.
Origin OF CHINA.
The exact period at which China was first made, is a question in-
volved in considerable obscurity; but we have reason to believe that
it is much older than Staffordshire ware. It partakes of those doubts
which hang round the earliest history of all earthen subjects; and
indeed, were it not for this, the accounts of China include so many
and such extensive breaks, that the wisest men are often puzzled by
them. Like riddles, they are easy of solution to those who know
them, but difficult to those who do not, even though these last be
better educated people; and again, like riddles, these breaks can ge-
nerally be better explained by inferiors who caused them than by
superiors, who often find themselves obliged to pay forfeit. China is
said to have taken its place as an empire about 2247 years before the
Christian era. Whenever it took its place, it is quite clear that it
was booked for an outside one among nations; and, to prove its con-
sistency, it has hitherto resolutely refused to come in. Some autho-
rities say that the name of the first Emperor was Fuh-he, but not a
Few-he left behind him deny this. It appears certain that some cen-
turies after him a virtuous sovereign reigned for 102 years; and so
extraordinary and outlandish was such a reign considered, that he ob-
tained the appellation of Ya-0 or Ya-hoo! After him Confusion seems
to havereigned for 1500years (longer eventhan George the Third). The
iron reign of Confusion was at length softened into that of Confucius;
and from that that time we know something, though not much, more
about them than we did before.
The TARTAR DYNASTY.
MONEY OF CHINA.
In the twelfth century the Chinese anticipated the “Old Lady of
Threadneedle-street,” and issued bank notes—but in consequence of
the invader Ghengis Khan having put millions to the sword, (which
of course with a paper currency he could easily do,) the great body of
the people were obliged to submit to a metallic currency thus rudely
thrust upon them.
ANTIQUITY OF CHINA.
A resolute antiquary, who resides very near to Chelsea, has con-
tended for the superior antiquity of England to China. He asserts,
upon the authority of some of the very oldest men who go about the
streets and cry oranges, that the word “China” is a corruption of
“Chaney;” and assuming this as a fact, he goes on to state, what no-
body can reasonably deny, namely, that Cheyne walk, Chelsea, is
considerably older than the oldest of these men. Antiquaries are
known to be amongst the boldest of the sons of Britton, or Britain ;
yet is there more plausibility about this theory than many they have
advanced; and it may fairly receive some confirmation from the uni-
versally known fact, that a long, long time ago China was made at
Chelsea.
Altistocracy OF CHINA.
Persons possessing any degree of consequence in China are divided
into nine classes, which in the language of the country are denomi-
nated “Kew Pin,” i. e. the nine ranks–or, more properly, mine pins,
for the Emperor, or “Golden Ball,” knocks them all down at pleasure.
Rank may be purchased of the Emperor; which proves that rank
corruption exists there, as elsewhere.
(To be continued.) -
ENTOMOLOGICAL NOTICE FOR THE MONTH OF
OCTOBER.
The common moth is now to be met with in muffs and tippets that have
been laid by for the winter. The Pater-Longipedes (Linnaeus) or Daddy-
longlegs, may be seen of an evening, and is easily captured by permitting
it to burn off its wings in the candle, and then despatching it with the
snuffers. Flies have quitted the kitchens, and gone to Brighton for the
benefit of the sea-air. The Sphynx Atropos or Death's-head moth,
makes itself scarce this month : there is a fine specimen of this insect in
the British Museum, but, as it is placed in the private collection, the
public cannot take the opportunity of inspecting it. Skippers are nu-
merous on the Thames, and may be discovered settling on the Lily, Rose,
Jasmine, &c. The Drinker still rejoices in October; but a great many have
already gone over to the Continent. Swallow-tails have long been of rare
occurrence, and common Whites will not appear again till next spring.
Camberwell Beauties have returned from the sea-coast, but are not to be
secured without a remarkably good fortune. Greylings are not met with
in any cabinet. The Entomologist must now secure his grubs for the
winter, and we doubt not that he will eventually obtain his desert:—and
so we bid him farewell.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SOME BORROWED FUN.
We are not often guilty of plagiarism; but there is an article in
the last number of Colburn's New Monthly Magazine and Humourist,
which it has been enriched with, we apprehend, in the latter capacity,
so irresistibly droll, that we cannot refrain from transferring its more
requisite points to our own pages. The “New Monthly” will, we
doubt not, overlook our delinquency; we belonging to a community
which a writer in it denominates the small fry of literature :—him-
self, of course, being one of its Leviathans.
Double stout.
The paper in question is one of a series entitled “Reminiscences
of a Medical Student.” It is not, we believe, a production of the
editor's : but it is almost as funny as anything that he has ever done.
It embraces a confession made by an individual who has been brought
into an hospital in the south of Ireland, with his body crushed to
pieces, to the house surgeon; and the patient's death concludes it,
like the pop of a squib. How such a subject can be treated with
jocosity may at first sight appear puzzling; but there is a region
adjoining the sublime, on which the horrible as closely borders.
Who does not laugh at the atrocities of Punch –(we do not mean
our own jokes): and is not even the innocent mirth of infancy excited
by the fate of “ Humpty Dumpty f"
This remarkably rich “confession” is the story of a Mr. Erris,
whose pecuniary prospects and domestic bliss have been blasted by a
rogue of the name of Ormond : and who revenges himself on the
author of his wrongs, by dragging him at a cart's tail. Mr. Erris
himself is in a sort of retributive pickle.
“I found his whole body,” says the ‘Medical Student,” “to be one
mass of injury, shattered with many fractures. His spine was so
much bruised that he had lost all power and sense in his body and
extremities. Not a muscle could he move save those of the head and
face, and he lay upon his back, every now and then giving his head a
sudden jerk accompanied by a twitching grin, half ludicrous, half
fearful, but at any rate singularly unnatural in its expression. The
bones of his lower limbs were completely smashed, and his haunches
had been crushed together.”
This, we imagine, is what Jonathan would call “an immortal smash.”
The sufferer must have looked like Pantaloon after Mr. T. Mathews
has shot him out of the cannon. Presently, with pantomimic fidelity
to nature and common sense, he is made so far to recover, as to relate
his history, which he thus jauntily commences.
“Well,” said he, in a ruminating way, “I don't care if I do tell you
a thing or two for a change : ... so come near, and I will give you a
report that will bang e'er a one in your writing-book.”
One is here reminded of the équivoque, “Lord Lovat walked and
talked half an hour after his head was cut off.” Patients with serious com-
pound fractures are usually brought to an hospital in a state of col-
lapse. But the above case is a comic one.
He goes on to describe himself as “having been a wild young slip
of a lad,” the son of a distiller, always drunk, and having, indeed, “no
recollection of perfect sobriety.” His father was “a strictly moral
person.” How his son must have preyed on his spirits He falls in
love with his father's house-maid, who was possessed of beauty which
rarely adorns the kitchen. It “was that of a Circe, tempting to evil:
there was something mystic, unholy in it.” He “resolves on her
ruin;” but he has met with more than his match. “Alas!” he
exclaims, “it was like a wolf resolving on the destruction of a con-
strictor serpent.” He might have said—like a Yankee trying to grin
down a rattle-snake; though perhaps he would therefore scarcely
have altered the simile for the funnier. He is “ the ruined party.”
He robs his papa's desk for her benefit, and (1) to please her, turns
Catholic : not, as afterwards appears, that she is particularly anxious
for his soul's welfare. “A whispered sentence, a smile and a kiss over-
turned all the arguments of Calvin, Knox, and Zuingle.” He marries
her; and his father being likely to disapprove of the connexion, he
begins to think seriously of murdering him.
At this ingenuous acknowledgement,
“I was much horrified,” says the writer; “and had unconsciously
made some gestures indicative of this feeling.” These, we suppose,
were an eversion of the lower eyelid, and a conclusive movement of
the extended fingers, the thumb being applied to the tip of the nose;
perhaps, also, the hand was jerked over the left shoulder.
Through the treachery of Ormond, he is turned out of his father's
house; not, however, without first having a “a regular fight” with
the old gentleman. Afterwards, Mr. Ormond taunts him in his mis-
fortunes; and he bites Mr. Ormond's throat; in return for which, that
person chastises him. Further, he suspects the said Ormond of undue
attentions to his wife. His worst suspicions, are confirmed ; and he
encounters his wronger in the street, on which occasion he indulges
in behaviour most divertingly eccentric.
“Would you believe it? all I did, was to stand and grin at him—
make faces at him—upon my soul.”
First stealing the money, he goes and buys a pistol, wherewith to as-
sassinate the seducer. He watches his opportunity; but just as he is
about to draw the fatal trigger, it occurs to him that shooting is too
good a death for such a villain. He is at length happily enabled to
murder his enemy in his own way. He has joined a gang of illicit
distillers, and Ormond consummates his injuries by destroying the
stock-in-trade of Messrs. Erris and Co.; Mr. E. looking on at a dis-
tance, and praying to the deril for revenge.
“Then, in the silent thoughts of my own heart, I prayed to the
fiend, that I felt was there at the time, that he would glut me to the
teeth with vengeance, though I should perish with the surfeit.” (!)
His orison is heard. Mr. Ormond, in trying to catch Mr. Erris,
after having destroyed his property, has the misfortune to be caught
by him ; at least, by his associates, who bind him hand and foot, and
thrust him into a vault. The narrator proceeds :—
“Let me see him, cried I; let me be sure of him. Two of them
immediately jumped into the vault and pushed him up through the
trap. He struggled much to avoid the sharp edges of the stones.
As his head and chest appeared through the aperture, Quin rushed
to him and dashed his fist with his whole force into his face.”
This must have spoiled his beauty a little, and probably favoured
the production of the under-mentioned phenomena, which his coun-
tenance exhibited on his beholding the injured Erris.
“As soon as he saw me standing before him, his face, which had
before been pale with fear, grew actually greenish-yellow in colour.
Presently a flow of blood gushed to his face, and the red mingling with
the yellow produced a lirid lurid hue, a satisfying indication of the
thoughts that were passing in his mind.”
Here a slight mistake, however, is made; and an opportunity for a
good joke lost. Red and yellow make orange; a cast of countenance
which would by no means have commended its possessor to the
mercy of wild Irishmen. But now for a capital passage.
“I stood and glared at him with all the luxury of triumphant
animosity, then going close to hin—”
We should like to see a portrait of Mr. Erris as he appeared when
glaring at his victim. Next comes, perhaps, the finest instance of
the aposiopesis comical that we ever had the pleasure of laughing at :-
“Now . I cried, now you”—(Here the narrator came out with a
torrent of imprecations altogether unsuitable for any pages).
This beats “Quos eyo” into smithereens. But a part of the invective
is preserved ; the language is tolerably strong.
“Now whose hands are you in Whose turn is it now ; How
have you served me ! Hearken, now, you black-hearted Judas-
think over what you have done to me, and reflect that with help from
the decil, I will take the full equivalent of it out of your body I
Before another sun rises, you will be murdered.”
MoRr FREE THAN WELCOME.
Mad wag Mr. Ormond is very near escaping, and his attempt so
to do gives occasion to the following comic incident.
“On darting across the vault to where the aperture gaped, we
found within it the body of our prisoner. His head was outside the
wall, and his shoulders had stuck fast in the outer opening. With
a wild shout of joy we caught hold of his heel, and drew him
gradually in.”

TAfter some trouble he is retaken, and,
“At last, flushed and covered with perspiration, his eyes wildly
glaring, his heart beating, and his breath panting, he lay on the floor
of the vault, his ankles and knees bound firmly together, and his
hands twisted and tied behind his back.”
“Poor felleh 1” as the afore-mentioned Mr. Mathews ejaculates
when Harlequin is sawn in two. By-the-by our “Medical Student.”
would supply that gentleman with several very telling “hits.” For
instance—
“As we stood, Quin, wiping the moisture from his brow, whispered me,
* Hadn't we better do it here?”
This is a stage whisper, of course; for the prisoner overhears it,
and roars out “Murder;” but, says his captor,
“Kicking the iron-shod toe of my brogue into his mouth (1) I put an
abrupt stop to this.”
“By putting your foot in it,” the “Medical Student” might have
added. But the story is almost too funny as it is.
“No,” said I, in reply to Quin, “I have a plan of my own.
hoist him out of the vault.” -
“Thereupon seizing him, we dragged him, vainly kicking and
wriggling his corded limbs, up through the trap.”
The trap f More pantomime. But, to proceed.
“Now,” said I to my comrade, “go and fetch me, first the cart, and
put it here, then bring out his horse.”
Away goes Mr. Erris with his victim, who, finding himself alone
with him, struggles to get free.
“When I saw this, taking out my knife, I gare him a small cut in
the throat (1) and told him that the next struggle he made it should go
deeper(1)
Mr. Ormond begs for mercy. “This is a nice horse of yours,
Jack,” says Mr. Erris. The prisoner redoubles his entreaties. Mr.
Erris works himself into a fury.
“Did you not—did you not scheme to ruin me, when I had been
the making of you ?—did you not mock me !—did you not lash me?
—did you not take my birthright ! Did you not take the wife of
my bosom **
“Here passion deprived me of the power of speech, my voice
ending in a fierce guttural cry.”
Such a noise, we conceive, as we once heard Mr. Wieland make,
when, in the character of a stage brigand, he knocked out the brains
of an imaginary infant on the boards of the Adelphi Theatre.
It has been observed by philosophers that the expression of
extreme terror is remarkably ludicrous. Of this fact our author is
evidently well aware. Ormond yells and shrieks for pity.
“In these last words his voice rose to a wild maniacal cry of
agonizing terror, while he twisted about and danced on his knees (1) in
the extremity of his dread and anxiety.”
Mr. Erris now serves Mr. Ormond as Achilles did Hector, only
that he improves upon the hero's joke, inasmuch as his victim is
alive and able to feel it. Away dashes the cart (the Medical Student
might have called it a “drag”), Mr. Erris driving. He says—
“I heard his head and face, as hanging down they were dragged along,
go knock, knock, on the stone hill-side; (!) whilst his shrieks rang and
echoed far away across the untrodden moorland.”
At last the cart breaks down, and Mr. Erris makes a post mortem
examination—Ormond's
“Face and head were completely gone—knocked off; only a small
shell-like fragment of the back of the skull remained, attached to the neck.
The forepart of his chest was torn open, and the body being still
quite warm, a thin vapoury steam ascended from it into the cold night air.
But I see I have horrified you too much—I will not go on with the
details.” (! t / )
Perhaps the joke is carried a little too far : as is that of the cata-
strophe, Mr. Erris's own death-scene.
“‘Oh the weight—the murderous weight of these mighty stones,
crushing my very bones to powder.—I feel them now—they are hot
—red-hot—Ah, Ormond, you hell-hound, will you keep them on me
—will you—ah—a-a-ah—.’
“A quantity of fluid bubbled from his mouth t t a convulsive grin
passed across his face, an indefinable change came over his black
staring eyes, and I knew he was dead.”
One word of advice to our entertaining author. In future, unless
he is writing for the “Penny Sunday Times,” or “White's Universal
Broad Sheet,” by whose readers his lucubrations will perhaps be
regarded as serious, let him borrow the “Doctor,” with his “Elixir
Vitae,” from the ancient dance of “Father Christmas.” To render
his jokes perfect, and ensure their being universally appreciated,
his dead men should jump up on their legs again with, * Here we
are, all alive-how are yah I." But have we, can we have—mis-

HOW TO TELL THE WEATHER FOR 1000 YEARS.
If you desire to know whether the day will be fine, take a walk of a few
miles into the country, until you come to a field where cows are grazing,
and if the animals turn their tails to the wind, be sure it will be stormy.
If they turn their faces it will be fine, but if some stand one way and
some the other, you had better toss up, and accordingly as the coin gives
you heads or tails, you will be able to solve the problem.
There is an admirable plan for ascertaining the state of the wind,
which may be discovered even in neighbourhoods where there are no
weathercocks. Take a pocket-handkerchief and wave it in the air, at the
same time looking at a pocket compass. The compass will give you the
north, and the action of the breeze upon the handkerchief will give you
the point from which the wind blows, and thus you get at a very impor-
tant fact by a short and simple process.
Lockr on The human understanding.
This experiment is better adapted for windy days, but by waiting for a
gust we have known it successful in nearly all weathers.
PUNCH'S DOMESTIC COOKERY.
THE following valuable hints are the result of a lengthy experience in
one of the first Metropolitan kitchens- A life of painful research into the
mysteries of the culinary art has however been well repaid if one social or
festive moment is sweetened by one of the dishes which we have given
instructions for preparing.
Prº-amed and GLAZED.
To DRESS COckles.
Purchase your cockles, and throw them rather smartly into a saucepan.
Place it on the fire, and gently agitate by shaking it about, so as to get
out the liquor from the fish, when having flavoured with common salt, you
may serve up in a salad bowl.
BUBBLE AND SQUEAK.
FIRST take your bubble and place it in a frying-pan. Now throw in
your squeak, and stir gently with rolling-pin. When the whole is done,
you may serve up with the usual concomitants.
GOOSEBERRY FOOL,
Take your gooseberry, and having carefully pared off the stalk and the
husk, wash it gently for four hours in cold water. Having done this with
the gooseberry, the fool is perfect.
HOW TO COLLAR SALMON.
When you have chosen a salmon of a fishmonger at your door, be care-
ful that he does not substitute an inferior fish for that which you have
selected. Now is the time to place your hand firmly round the gills, and
you will find that you have collared your salmon.
How To DRY A HERRING.
Take your herring and wipe it with a coarse cloth, but if the object
should not be achieved, hang the fish before a brisk fire; and if you per-
mit it to remain there long enough, you will have dried your herring.

COMMISSION OF ENOUIRY.
We hasten to lay before our readers some extracts from the recent
report of the Committe for Enquiry into the state of the Banking Dis.
tricts—the disclosures made—while calculated to transfix the heart of
shuddering humanity—throw much light on the subject of the No-hours-
and-as-few-minutes-as-possible bill now before the house.
Eramination of A. Bog NY, Esq.
By the Chairman. Are you acquainted with the manners and treatment
of the people employed in the banking disºricts :
A. B. I am. The greater part of the labour is done by men called in
that part of the country “clerks,” but the more fitting name would be
“slaves.”
Q. Why do you apply the term, “slaves 1’’
A. B. Their situation, restraint, and the coercion of their taskmasters,
make that a fitting term.
By Mr. Brute. Do they not become “clerks” of their own accord
A. B. I should say not.
Q. Explain yourself.
A. B. I am a penny-a-liner.
Q. I mean explain your meaning.
A. B. I do not know what you refer to.
Mr. Brute. Give the reasons for this belief.
A. B. The occupation is very generally disliked. They are entrapped
into it at an early age, by parents and guardians. Few would choose it
for themselves.
By the Chairman: What occupation would have been generally chosen?
A. B. Many would have preferred being independent gentlemen.
Q. What would have been the object of the rest, if left to their own
inclinations !
A. B. Some would have been leading tragedians, some authors of cele-
brity, while many would have devoted themselves to the practical sciences,
under Professor Waterford, M.A., R.Q.U., I.S.
By Mr. Brute. Cannot they leave the employment if they do not like it?
A. B. Not generally.
Q. How do you mean
A. B. It depends on circumstances.
Q. Upon what circumstances !
A. B. Upon their circumstances.
By the Chairman. Have you known of an instance of a clerk making
his escape from his employer :
A. B. Yes, several.
Q. Name one.
A. B. James Thompson escaped from his employers. He went off in
TAking to his EELs.
such a hurry that he forgot to balance his books; and the cash was either
over or short I forget which.
Mr. Brute. Was he retaken?
A. B. Yes, he was found by a Bow Street officer at Boulogne disguised
as a gentleman. He had undergone great hardships during twelve hours
in the steamer, and had lost the use of his whiskers through fear of re-
cognition.
Q. Do you know what became of him
A. B. He was transported for fourteen years.
Earamination continued.
In answer to a question of the Chairman,
A. B. stated that the work is performed in rows or gangs of from three
to ten.
Mr. Brute. Stop a minute. Does one gang work till relieved by
another ?
A. B. No, they do not relieve each other. The practice is I believe for
each to give the other as much to do as possible. * * * * the work is
often performed in very painful positions.
Earamination of DR. THEBLEx.
Q. Are you a medical man
Dr. T. Yes, I'm a medical gentleman.
Q. Have you seen the working-places or “houses" where banking is
conducted 1
Dr. T. I have not. -
Q. Are you ready to give evidence on the present matter of inquiry
Dr. T., I am. * * * * I have examined carefully a pint bottle
of air which has been worked in for six hours. I found that a mouse
would not live in the bottle twenty minutes, unless you prevented him from
running out at the neck.
By the Chairman. Pray attend to this question. Is the air there as
healthy as on Hampstead Heath
Dr. T. I do not know—I never tested the latter—I should say not.
Q. Or as that of the Cigar Divan
Dr. T. Decidedly not.
By the Chairman. Where these unfortunates have been compelled to
work till 5 P.M. what appearance do they offer the next morning?
Dr. T. Frequently a very seedy one. The skin is often hot and
feverish—a slight nausea is felt—a heavy pain presses over the eyes,
which are dull and swollen ; in severe cases one or both the eyes may be
observed puffed up and discoloured—violent fits of yawning cannot be
resisted—the pulse, in these cases, is often high, the pocket invariably low.
MR. A. Bogny re-called.
By the Chairman. Have you heard that certain clerks called “hout-
dors,” or out-doers, are compelled to walk about the city with a chain
fastened round the waist?
A. B. It is a fact—moreover a very heavy amount is frequently attached
to the chain.
Q. Did you ever hear of a young man of high feeling unable to bear up
against the disgrace and hardship of this brutal system, pining under the
affliction until disease and misery brought him to an early grave
A. B. No, I never did.
We are prevented from extracting more, from want of room, and
respect for the feelings of our readers. We trust that we have given
enough to raise the warmest sympathy for the hardest-worked, the worst
paid, and the most polite body of men in the metropolis.
SONGS OF THE FLOWERS.
No. VII.--THE SONG OF THE PRIMROSE.
I'M a meek little primrose, and early in spring
When flowers far statelier dare not appear,
I peep from the ground and glad tidings I bring,
For I tell that the triumph of Flora is near.
There are roots that are taller and stronger in stem,
Much sweeter in odour, and fairer to see,
But the sunshine which later glares hotly on them,
With its earliest warmth gives existence to me.
Though I bloom in the garden, I scorn not the field,
And oft in the humblest of hedges an found ;
But beauty is beauty, where'er'ds conceal’d,
And fair is the primrose though weeds may surround.
I’d sooner with plants insignificant blend,
Than with flowers more brilliant be thrown in the shade,

PUNCH2S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER XV.-WEALTH AND ITS USES. STORY OF THE SLIPPERS.
“ JUST ENOUGh.”
ONE of the best and most satisfactory uses of wealth, my dear boy,
is to dazzle with our riches the eyes of our neighbours. Your dear
mother once hit this point to a nicety. We had long expected the
payment of a small legacy bequeathed to her by a distant relation,
whose exact degree of kindred I cared not much to inquire into. It
was enough for us that your dear mother's name was down in the
will ; and that the executors—two unexceptionable attorneys—pro-
mised some day or another to faithfully perform the injunctions of
the dear deceased. “And when we get this money,” said your
mother to me in a moment of connubial confidence, “I’ll tell you
what we'll do with it—I’ll tell you, my love, what we'll do with it.”
As I knew she would proceed no further until I begged to know
her intentions, I at once put the question. “What, my dearest,
what will you do with it?” “Why, my love,” answered your parent,
her eyes sparkling with pleasure, “we’ll take the plate out of pawn,
and give a party.” Yes; the great gratification to be gathered from
the legacy was, that we might flash our four tea-spoons and pair of
tongs in the eyes of people for whom we had not the slightest esteem;
and to one of whom your mother had, I know, on three occasions cap-
tiously refused the loan of her bellows.
You will find, as you know more of the world, that your mother's
tea-spoons and tongs are, albeit the humble, yet the true representa-
tives of whole buffets of plate. You will possibly find yourself invited
to feast with a man who cares no little whether you have a dinner or
not ; his only object is to show you your envious face in his golden
salvers, to make your mouth water with his Dutch fruit-pieces; in a
word, not to fill your belly with his turtle and venison, but to possess
your mind with a prostrating sense of his wealth. He takes posses-
sion of your admiration, as a feudal chief receives the homage of his
vassal. And this you are to consider the true use—the real dignity
of wealth.
There are some enthusiasts—that is, the generous mob of philan-
thropists with empty pockets—who vow that wealth is only given to
the rich in trust for the poor. Whilst you remain a pauper, remain
:|. religion—when you obtain money, read your recantation before
1018s.
Philosophers have held that the aurum potabile, if taken into the
human system, tends to refine mortal clay of its inherent grossness,
and by degrees to assimilate the flesh of earthly man to the flesh of
the gods. Whether gold be swallowed, or a sufficient quantity of it
be merely carried in the pocket, the grateful result is precisely the
same. Consider hundreds of the heavy-purse-bearers of the world,
and tell me if it be otherwise with them. They have the lineaments
of men; they are bipeds like the poorest beggar : but their Inoral and
Rhysical systems are so coloured, so permeated with the precious
metal, that they are creatures quite apart from the ordinary race of
mortals. Do their daily acts betray their affinity with them? Are
they not as far above the pauper who quenches his thirst at the brook,
as the pauper above the frog he disturbs.
I think I have heard you say, you love the face of Nature; the
open sky—the fields, the trees, the shining river, all are glorious to
you. My dear boy, whatever may be your present delight in con-
templating these objects, as yet you know nothing of their valuo.
Look upon them with the eye of a proprietor, and what a bloom will
come upon the picture I Every bit of turf will be an emerald to you ;
every grasshopper will chirrup—a very angel to your self-complacency;
every tree, moved by the wind, will bow to you as you pass by it; the
very fish in the river will
“Show to the sun their wav'd coats dropp'd with gold,”
reflecting these your wealth, and not their beauty. Nay, that portion
of the sky which rains and shines its blessings upon your land, you
will behold as yours; yea, human pride, strong in its faith of property,
will read upon the face of heaven itself—“MEUM 1” Every sunbeam
will be to you as tangible as if it were an ingot. How delicious and
how entrancing must have been the feelings of Adam when he awoke
in Eden, to find himself—a landed proprietorſ
If you can walk the fields and look upon the sky with these en-
nobling emotions, then, my son, you will know the real merits—the
true uses of wealth. You will then own that it is only the man of
money who can worship Nature as she ought to be worshipped; in-
asmuch as it is only he who can truly estimate her thousand beauties;
who can feel his heart rise and glow as he surveys her charms; and,
putting his hands in his pockets, can love her with a lover's
kindness.
This man, rejoicing on his own land, meets something in shape like
himself plodding the sod. This two-legged animal envies the squirrel
in the wood—the hare he has startled from its form : he has nothing;
his very hands are useless to him ; he is denied a spade to delve with,
a plough to guide. Poor wretch he is encrusted with ignorance;
covered like a tortoise. What eyes, what thoughts has he for the
loveliness of nature ? Let the gracious gentleman who owns the soil
and the pauper cumbering it, sit them down upon two hillocks and
discourse on the loveliness of life.
Well, they have talked there three hours; for see, the sun is
blazing in the west. What have you heard from the man of wealth
Has he not spoken of Nature as a benignant goddess—has he not
painted life with the bloom of Paradise still upon it His whole
speech has been a thanksgiving ! What have you heard from the
pauper ?—evidence of grossest ignorance.
“A primrose by a river's brim,
A yellow primrose is to him—
And it is nothing more.”
He looks upon the meads, pranked with a thousand flowers, with a
heavy, leaden look; they are, he says, to him, a blank—a nothing.
And for life, he feels it most when it is gnawing at his bowels.
Will you, after this, my son, say that one of the highest uses of
wealth is not to quicken our apprehension to the thousand beauties
showered about us? Hence, my child, the inevitable intelligence and
superiority of the rich—hence, the gloom and crassitude of the poor.
If you love Nature, you must obtain wealth for the true—the lawful
enjoyment of her. You must wed her with a golden ring.
Having obtained wealth, you are only to consider your own gra-
tification in its outlay. There are foolish people who stint their
appetites of many pleasant fillips, that when the worm is wriggling
in their shrouds their thankful children may be sure of dinners.
Leave your children to shift for themselves—Destitution is a fine
whetstone to ingenuity. -
In the course of my travels, I once entered a church in Amster-
dam. I was attracted to a monument by a pair of slippers, cut in
marble; and underneath written, as I was told, in Flemishy–
“Just Enough.”
I found upon inquiry that this was the monument of a wise, rich
man, who resolved to make his living appetites the tomb of his wealth;
and so nicely adjusted his outlay, that when he died nought was left
of his magnificent fortune but his pair of old slippers. “It is just
enough,” he said, and expired.
There are rich men who live and die in the spirit of the Flemish
spendthrift: for to them, this world—and this world only is—
“Just ENough.”
CoMPLAINTs have recently been made of a want of impartiality on the
judgment seat, but it seems that this accusation will apply in higher places,
for even the celestial bodies are amenable to it. There is to be an eclipse
of the moon on the 8th of December, 1843, which, it is announced, will be
partial.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIWARI.
PUNCH*S COMIC MYTHOLOGY.
CHAP. III.-ACIS AND GALATEA.
EVERAL centuries ago, in those re-
mote days which have no date (for they
existed before History had snatched
the pen from the hand of Imagination),
Mount Etna was the country seat of a
gigantic gentleman named Polyphemus.
This sporting box being sixty-three
miles in circuit merely, and only two
miles high, was barely big enough for
his extensive establishment. It was,
however, a convenient edifice, and
although it only had one fire-place,
§ was particularly warm in winter, its
fuel being thunder ; and from its em-
bers the benevolent inhabitant occa-
sionally supplied the Sicilian public
with earthquakes. The chimney was
constructed upon the Lapland-hut prin.
ciple of architecture, being formed by
means of a small hole in the roof, not more than twenty miles
in circumference, the ruins of which are known to modern tra-
vellers, as a crater. The whole was comfortably thatched with
snow, so that the snug abode was not too warm in summer, nor
too chilly in winter." -
On the morning to which our tale refers, an attentive observer
might have noticed—even without a microscope—that, as he sat
d at breakfast, the countenance of Polyphemus was shaded with
care. His eye—fixed in deep thought, as immovably as the dome of St.
Paul's—seemed to be intently occupied in taking measure of the toe of his
boot. His hands were thrust listlessly into his breeches pockets, whilst ever
and anon he heaved powerful and sonorous sighs, each explosion of which not
only blew the flame that raged within his soul, but also the fire before which
he sat, causing it to flare up to the very top of the crater. ...Presently, as if
to divert his melancholy, he essayed to eat; but it was evident his appetite
was impaired. The stewed haunch of elephant was sent away untasted,
and although he dissected a brace of roast oxen with some alacrity, and
helped himself to greens (consisting of firs boiled in turpentine), yet he did
not finish the bonne bouche with his usual rapidity, but hastily called for a
dish of kids a la sauce d'enfer, and a soothing draught of bottled brim-
stone.
The cloth, which covered several acres of table, being removed, he hastily
summoned his valet, and that obsequious Cyclops soon appeared with his
insignia of office. In one hand he bore a lake of lather inclosed in a goodly-
sized vat, whilst his arms were encumbered with a pair of razors and a
small tooth-comb;-in other words, a couple of scythes, and several iron
rakes ingeniously bound togethert. -
The duties of the toilet having been completed with more than usual
care, the valet complimented his master on the extensive beauty of his
looks.
“What's the use,” growled the monster sulkily, “while Galatea remains
insensible to my personal attractions !”
“Tasteless vixen l’’ responded the Cyclops.
you ever tried 1” -
“Tried 1" abruptly repeated the love-sick man-mountain. “I have
tried *...; ;—entreaties, threats, insinuations, and an offer of
twenty thousand a month with a separate establishment ;—but all to
no purpose.”
“I was about to observe that a serenade
“A what '' inquired the stupendous swain, rolling his eye about in its
socket like the hull of a seventy-four in a hurricane.
“A serenade—music, Sir. Orpheus, you know
“Orpheus be — hanged. I can't play the lute.”
“But the pan's pipes divinely; and as a bass singer your equal is not
to be found even in Italy.”
In another moment the vast frame of Polyphemus was shaken by
contending emotions. He paced the ten miles and a quarter which
bounded the narrow limits of his breakfast parlour with rapid strides.
Then stopped, looked blandly in the face of his attendant, and told him
he might have the bear-skin coat he so earnestly solicited a day or two
since. He liked the idea vastly.
“Step off instantly,” he commanded, “and order a hundred reeds to
be made up into a stupendous mouth-organ. Let then be nicely tuned,
and be sure there is not a semi-tone less than twelve octaves and a half.
Remember, a hundred l’”
“By the bye, Sir, have

* “Sunt mihi pars montis vivo pendentia saxo
Antra; quibus nec Sol medio sentitur in aestu,
Nec sentitur hyems.”—Ovid. Metam. Lib. xiii., Fab. 8,-93-4.
+ “Jam rigidos pectis rastris, Polypheme, capillos,
Jam libet hirsutam tibi falce recidere barbam.”—id. 47.8.
The valet bowed and obeyed. Meantime Polyphemus began to com-
pose a serenade.
On the sea-shore, not far from the foot of Mount Etna, stood a neat
marine villa, consisting entirely of stone, uncemented even by mortar. It
was in fact a grotto neatly fitted up with moss, corner-cupboards, rustic
seats, a table, an hour-glass, a book, and an imitation hermit stuffed with
straw, provided with real spectacles and a horse-hair beard; it was, in
fact, a favourite spot for gypsy parties to assemble from the neighbour-
ing cities, but occasionally was made a place of assignation by lowers.
Near to this grotto Polyphemus had been in the habit of seeing his enslaver,
and often wondered what business she could possibly have to transact
which caused her so regularly to visit the spot. Once within the hermitage,
she was safe, for her giant adorer was unable, from his bulk, to place him-
self in any position #. allowed him to peep into it. Even whilst he was
composing the love-song, the subject of it was there ; but listening to
vows of a softer, more tender, more welcome nature.
Acis, though only a shepherd, ought to have been, in the opinion of the
nymph, a divinity. There is no doubt but he was, from the accounts
handed down to us, a remarkably good-looking fellow. His performances
on the pipe and tabor were, we are told, infinitely more melodious than
the lowing of bulls, or the bleating of sheep. His person can only be
portrayed in the words of an eminent and ancient poet, whose fervid fancy
bursts forth in descriptive sublimity thus:—
“He was tall, and as straight as the poplar tree,
His cheeks were as red as the rose
He look'd like a squire of high degree,
When dress'd in his Sunday clothes.
In a word, no youth of the honey-yielding plains of Enna possessed so
sweet a figure or flourished his crook with a more captivating twirl;
indeed, Acis was a perfect lady-killer—with a hook.
The fanciful historian of this transaction has not recorded what took
place between Acis and Galatea during their interview in the grotto;
which may be considered a fortunate omission—love-making having been
from the earliest ages the same inane, withess, insipid formulary it is at
the present time, and there is not the least doubt that, at this téte-à-téte,
Acis indulged in the same comparisons between the stars and Galatea's
eyes (giving, of course, the latter the preference), roses and cheeks, corals
and lips, pearls and teeth, that are being made by the millions of lovers
who are at this present instant protesting unto their mistresses in all the
sly corners and crannies of this terrestrial sphere, whether in the
European boudoir, the Eastern harem, the groves of Blarney, beside the
fountains of the desert, or in the kraal of the Hottentot.
But the murmurs of love were soon interrupted by a noise even more
frightful than that made by the prompter through the stock speaking-
trumpet of Drury-lane Theatre, as the “cue” for the chorus “Wretched
lovers.”—Acis starting to the mouth of the cave, climbed to the summit
of the rock to see what was the matter. To his horror and amazement,
he beheld the front door of Polyphemus' mansion open, and the monster
issue from it, appearing as “a woody peak of lofty mountains, when it
appears separate from others *.” Like a snail conscious of having ven-
tured too far from his shell, the terrified youth incontinently slunk back
into the cave.
The rocks trembled as Polyphemus approached. But the consterna-
tion of the lovers was frightful when they found he had taken his station
immediately over their heads. He played an overture on his mouth-
organ, and they expected every instant that the roof would tumble in
from sheer reveberation. They awaited their fate with that patient phi-
losophy which visits those who know they cannot help it. . Their hair
stood on end as the musical mountain roared out the following touching
serenade:—
Only say
You'll my mistress be. Ah,
Don't say nay,
Charming Galatéal
1've got an establishment very great,
Swarming with servants and clients-
Consent then to be but my merry mate,
And I'll give you the choice of my giants.
I have gardens and horses galore;
My stud has a dozen grey dapples in't!
Such an orchard—there are, I am sure,
Ten thousand square acres of apples in't!
Only say, &c.
I have got you a boudoir, and dairy
For an endless succession of syllabubs f ;
'Stead of lap-dogs, I'll give you, my fairy,
A couple of bruin's twin filly-cubs i.
* This is Odysseus's account of the giant (Homer, od. X.); he also says that
twenty-two four-wheeled waggons could not move the rock which closed the door.
+ The expression “partem liquefacta coagula durant,” evidently implies some-
thing less liquid than syllabubs, perhaps cheese (sic in Dryden), or at most curds-
and-whey : but then syllabubs are so much more poetical, and certainly much
micer.
t The classical reader, on referring to lines 94, 118, and 186, will perceive that ous

I have wines in the wood—quite a grove of 'em,
Which imported from Thracia's mount we got;
And of bullocks and sheep such a drove of 'em,
I have never had time e'en to count the lot
Only say,
You'll my mistress be.
Don't say nay,
Charming Galtéa.
The ſorrible noise Polyphemus made in thus pouring forth the tender
sensibilities of his soul was so hideously awful, that the lovers sought
refuge in the open air; thinking that sudden death would be preferable
to the prolonged torture of such a serenade. Fondly imagining, like
ostriches, that if they could not see their enemy he could not see them, they
retired to a cranny in the rock, and mutually hid in each other's bosoms.
A noise succeeded, the echoes of which would certainly have overthrown
the Tower of Babel, had it been built at the time. Acis trembled
with fright, and thinking only of his own safety, fled from Galatea, who
took a dive into the sea. The monster tore a few tons of stone from the
rock, took good aim—Acis shrieked, turned blue with fright, and was
speedily silenced by a chip of the rock knocking him down. Exceedingly
angry at such brutal treatment, Galatea came ashore, and began abusing
the monster with immense volubility.
Some say that Acis was changed into a River; but the
bility is, from his extreme pusillanimity he remained what
lived—a regular pump.
Ah,
reater proba-
i. had always
THE BRISTOL HOAX.
It seems that the Bristol Hoax is to be dramatised, and Punch there-
fore wishing success with all his heart and hump to the efforts of the
playwright who will undertake the job, offers the following suggestions,
with a view to its furtherance. The part of Woolley should be in the line
commonly called the sentimental fathers, and may be undertaken by the
“heavy man” of the company. He should be always talking of the day-
dreams of his infancy; and if the actor who embodies the part has been
engaged to play the “singing robbers,” he may introduce, in an early part
of the play, the cavatina of the Bass in the Sonnambula. Perhaps, how-
ever, it would be better to make him an old sailor (for sailors are always
sentimental), who, having gone to sea early in life, comes home dreadfully
love-sick about some one he has never seen, but dreamed of “when coiled
up in the shrouds of the main top-gallant during a storm in the Bay of
Biscay, he has shed a tear of sensibility into the foaming abyss below, and
answered the howling of the north wind with a soft sigh of sentiment.”
Such a speech as this would draw down thunders of applause, for there is
nothing so “safe,” as the theatrical phrase is, as a blubbering British
seaman. Such a scene as this would also give an opportunity for the
introduction of a naval hornpipe, a result that invariably follows when a
tar begins to twaddle, and he might lead up to it by a speech, referring to
those “happy hours,” when he tripped along the quarter-deck, as light as
one of Mother Carey's chickens, and as taught as a tarpaulin.” In the
latter scenes of the play he should become decidedly melodramatic, and
the incident of “missing the hand through the door” is one that the actor
will not let slip through his fingers. It might be very highly wrought up,
and should be made the finish of an act, the characters forming what is
called a tableau, of which the hand should be the centre.
Mary Anne Briers should be played by the actress who does what is
technically termed the “leading business.” Perhaps it would be better
to make her secretly in love with the watchmaker who was done out of
the watch, and it would be a novel idea to make her hopeless passion for
the dealer in time-keepers the mainspring of the whole conspiracy. It
would be a magnificent flight of imagination to suppose, that finding her-
self slighted by the watchmaker, she determines that at least she will
attract his notice by forcing him to prosecute her, and this would give a
fine opportunity for a soliloquy about the stringency of the criminal law,
and the horrible possibility of the watchmaker forfeiting his recognisances
in case of his being bound over to appear at the Old Bailey.
Mary Morgan should be the walking lady of the piece, and if she sings,
so much the better, for she can have a duet with the magistrate at Union
Hall, and might introduce the scene of “Tyrant, soon I'll burst thy chains,”
one struggle Mone, and 1 AM rare. (synon.)
rendering of Polyphemus's love-ditty is in many places literal. As a comic song,
however, we must, in candour, acknowledge the great inferiority of our version to
the elegant iambics of the Drury-lane bass solo beginning–
“O, luddier than the berry,
O, sweeter than the cherry '"
in the cell at the House of Correction, the chorus being taken up by Mr.
Chesterton,and his subordinates.
Mr. Woolley should begin to soften in the second act, and a lapse of
thirty years should have intervened before the commencement of the third,
when he should be supposed to be travelling in Italy to restore his mental
tranquillity. He should have been stopping at an inn in the middle of the
Alps, when two females should come to the door and ask for charity. In
a little while he should fancy he recognises one of the voices, and one of
the females throwing off her bonnet, should disclose the features of Mary
Ann Briers, while the other tearing aside a black lace veil, should stand
before him in the character of his wife—once Mary Morgan. Woolley
should relent towards both, and a party of Alpine villagers coming in
should be invited to a feast, and there could then be a joyous finale—con-
cluding with that enticing line in a playbill,
A DANCE BY ALL THE Characters.
Of the scenery much might be made. In the first act, there could be
the extensive timber-yard of Mr. Woolley at Bristol, in which much
bustle and animation might be introduced by the workmen, supposed to be
rushing out for their beer at four o'clock, and having thus got the stage
clear for Woolley, he could speak his soliloquy, and dance his hornpipe.
In the second act there would be the interior of the police-office, in
which a low comedian might be introduced by making the second magis-
trate rather jocose, and punning upon the statutes cited, the questions put,
and the answers given on the occasion of the examination. The cell in
Coldbath-fields would also admit of much scenic effect, and the ceremony
of cutting the hair of some prisoners might give a vividness to the picture,
which would be highly conducive to the success of the drama.
In the third act nothing could be better than the Alps, and a grand
effect in the way of costume might be got, by making Woolley a Gerulan
baron, in a military dress, he having lately won an inaccessible castle, and
an unpronounceable title, in the Hamburgh Lottery.
If the ideas we have given are only properly carried out, we will answer
for the success of the suggested drama at any of the minor theatrical
establishments of the Metropolis. .

PUNCH, OR THE LOND
SKETCHES OF FEMALE POLITICIANS.
No. I.-Miss WALKER.
We do not think it necessary to offer any apology to Miss Walker
for making free with her in these pages, for we are quite sure, that
when liberty is in question, she will have no objection to our taking
just as much as we please; and Miss Walker was too tempting a
subject for “Punch,” with all his modesty, to refrain from em-
bracing her.
We must beg, however, to be most distinctly understood, when we
state, that we do not intend to cast any reflection upon Miss Mary
Anne Walker, who has lately rendered herself notorious in the
neighbourhood of Newgate, and, like other illustrious agitators,
gained an unexpected elevation at the Old Bailey. The female
Chartists are a very numerous class—their name is in fact legion ;
and why may not the names of some of them be Walker Indeed
we are disposed to believe that female Chartism and Walker may be
regarded as synonymous. We cannot, therefore, be accused of per-
sºnality in our present biography, for “Punch" is by far too prudent
a ſerson to wantonly brave the indignation of a young lady who not
only speaks with what her Chartist auditors would call a-claur, but
who, if provoked to the scratch, would no doubt come off with 4-car
likewise. We must not, therefore, be supposed to allude to the
vigorous-minded and able-bodied Mary Anne, who is so ready “to
fing back” all sorts of things at any “scoundrel” who should make
an attempt on her “political” virtue. Having said thus much, in
order to prove that we have no intention of violating the domestic
Privacy of Miss Mary Anne, whose eloquent denunciation of Lord
Abinger is sufficient to make the Chief Baron tremble in his judicial
fur tippet—having, as we hope, propitiated the irascible “ English
maiden,” whose invitation to the “young men” to “come out” and
hear a woman speak, is accompanied by a delicate, but decisive hint,
that the said “young men" will be summarily smashed in any
attempt to influence the public principle, whatever may be their
Power over the private affections of the “lady patriots”—havin -
taken the precautions alluded to, we proceed to a short biography of
the interesting young creature whose name stands at the head of the
present article.
The illustrious subject of our sketch is a member of the honoured
house of Walker, and is supposed to be descended in a direct line
from the renowned Hookey, who occupied a post under government,
nnd devoted his time to the diffusion of letters in the district where
he was a resident. Miss Walker, the female Chartist, gave indica-
tions at a very early age of a turn for public life, and from her de-
cidedly masculine predilections, she acquired the appellation of
Tom-boy in her own immediate neighbourhood. Her love of liberty
was manifested in her free and unreserved participation in the
games of hop-scotch, and oranges, and lemons with any knot of
children, without regard to sex, who were pursuing their sport in
the public streets; and during the contested election for West-
minster, she was one of the foremost of those who used to pelt Sir
Murray Maxwell with cabbage-stalks, and follow home the celebrated
Henry Hunt in his open hackney-coach, containing his committee,
and the two patriotic sweeps who are renowned in history for having
given their votes to him. -
It would be an unprofitable task to trace Miss Walker through an
honourable life of nearly half a century, during which time her
character seems to have been so well known that no male “scoun-
drel" appears to have ventured on an attempt to influence her public
sentiments by assuming the position of “husband,” with regard to
her. Her first début as an orator was at or about the time when the
new police were established ; and such was her hatred of this uncon-
stitutional force, that she used to attend every morning opposite the
station-house, in her own neighbourhood, and eloquently denounce
them as “raw lobsters,” to their very teeth—a piece of spirit that
generally won her the applause of the bystanders.
This fine love of freedom was not unobserved by the great men
who were struggling for the glorious privilege of pensioning of the
Sovereign, cancelling the titles of the aristocracy, and paying off the
public debt by letting the nation take the benefit of the act—a
measure to be achieved by sending the Prime Minister through the
Insolvent Court. Miss Walker was invited to one of the meetings
held for the purpose of furthering the good cause, and she soon
became an uncompromising stickler for the charter, whose watch-
word of “Nothing for ever, everything for nothing, and anything
for anybody,” she adopted with truly feminine ardour. -
The political opinions of Miss Walker may be summed up in a
very few words; and it is a remarkable fact that any man with whom
she has come in contact, is always fully impressed with the idea that
woman may be left to herself—and that if every woman were a Miss
Walker, the sex would find very little difficulty in having their right
to stand alone most thoroughly acknowledged. -
As the female Chartists are an object just now of some interest, we
have prevailed upon Miss Walker—not Mary Anne-but the de-
|scendant of Hookey, to give our artist a sitting. It will be seen that
she is just the woman to “keep off” any man, and to give faith in
the Chartist doctrine, that some of the sex may at least be spared
from the domestic hearth, of which ladies of less pretension than the
Walkers are content to be the ornament.
BALLADS OF THE BOYS.
No. I.--THE MUFFIN-BOY.
The wind whistles cold and the rain drops fast ;
But what are the wind and the rain to me?
Right onwards I go through the pitiless blast,
For the muffins—yes, muffins—are wanted for tea.
They say that my bell has a cheerful sound,
To them it speaks of comfort and joy;
Ah! little they think of the dreary round
That is taken at eve by the muffin-boy.
All snug in my basket the muffins lie,
Until to the public they are sold ;
They in blankets are warmly wrapped—but I
Must go my rounds in the bitter cold.
And often at eve they practise jokes,
By calling after me but to annoy ;
Indeed 'tis cruel thus to hoax
The worn and weary muffin-boy.
HIS soul is on the RAck.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 195
T H E S E S S I O N S.
an ode Fort Music.
When Parliament was fresh and young,
While yet election squibs were sung,
The M.P.s throng'd to take their seats
Through London's country-leading streets,
Exulting, trembling, burning, glowing,
With patriotic zeal o'erflowing,
By turns they felt the teeming mind
To silence forced, to speak inclined ;
Till once, ’tis said, when all were fired,
Fill'd with speeches, rapt, inspired,
From the surrounding benches nigh
They strove to catch the Speaker's eye;
And as they oft had tried apart
Lessons in the forensic art,
Each, as the Speaker ruled the hour,
Would prove his own expressive power.
First arose his skill to try,
Mid wild abuse bewilder'd stray'd,
Accusing those in places high
Of making statesmanship a trade 1
Next " " rush’d—his eye's clear fire
Told of power that lurk'd within—
In some few words he squashed the liar,
And stripp'd the falsehoods bare and thin.
With woeful measures, poor Joe Hume!
Low plaintive sounds beguiled his soul,
In solemn, strange, and fearful fume,
He summ'd the “tottle of the whole.”
But thou, old boy! with tongue so glib,
What was thy expected pleasure ?
Still it cried “Repale's the measure!”
And bid the friends of Ireland “agitate l’’
Still did his tongue that word prolong,
And now deject, and now elate,
He spoke of Erin's worth, and Erin's wrong;
And as his eyes and hands uprose,
Each Tory's finger touch'd the scornful nose,
And Dan O'Connell smiled, and waved his Irish “sprig' "
And ionger had he spoke, but, with a frown,
Lo! Muntz impatient rose;
He stroked his bushy beard in anger down,
And, with a withering look,
A roll of Anti-Poor-law papers took,
And told a tale so drear and dread,
Was never people's voice so full of woel
And ever and anon he curl’d
The biggest whisker in the world :
While, as the hairs his fingers pass'd between,
Post-boy pitying Sibthorp sigh'd
Over his own eclypsed pride:
But still Muntz kept his wild unalter'd mien,
And, with its hairy wings, his seem’d a cherub's head
Thy politics, brays Pal., to nought were fix'd,
Fine proof of thy all-grasping mind!
With differing themes thy speeches were in-mix’d,
Now courted Whigs, and now found Tories kind.
With eyes fast closed, as one at rest
Lord Glenelg sat, supremely blest ;
And from his dark retired seat,
In notes by distance made more sweet,
Pour'd through the mellow nose his drowsy soul;
And echoing back from benches round,
Other noses join'd the sound;
On right and left the iningled measure stole,
Or in one long-drawn breath, with fond delay,
Round a holy calm diffusing,
Love of sleep, and dreamy musing,
In hollow yellings died away !
But, oh! how alter'd to a sprightly tone,
When , a man of wondrous tongue,
One hand upon his waistcoat put,
By hooked thumb in armhole hung,
With sparkling eye, and firm advanced foot,
A face to Whig and Rad. well known.
The Treasury benches in the van,
The Opposition pale and wan,
Listen’d enraptured to the man;
Dull senses even seem'd to feel surprise,
And Sleep roused up and rubb'd his drowsy eyes!
Last came Peel's ecstatic trial
With majority advancing,
First to New Tariff laws his lore address'd,
But soon he poured from his wrath-full phial
The Income Tax, whose ease he loved the best 1
They would have thought who heard his strain
They saw in ancient Rome her saviour stand,
Amid the lyres of the Imperial band,
To the triumphant notes unwearied dancing,
While, as his pearl-white pinions swept the strings,
Joy pranced with Fear a wild fantastic round,
Plain were all profits seen, strong chests unbound
And he amid his frolic play,
As if he would some part repay,
Shook promises by thousands from his wings!
O Parliament the people aid 1
Friend of debtors wisdom's shade 1
Why now to us, thy worth denied,
Lay'st thou thy ancient strength aside P
As in that old forensic place
You learn'd to body forth with grace 1
St. Stephen's now, alas ! for these,
Cannot recall old memories!
Is all thy ancient power dead,
And with that chapel echoes fled 2
Arise ! as in that olden time,
Warm, energetic, true, sublime!
Thy speeches in that golden age
Fill many a glowing, storied page,
'Tis said, and I believe the tale,
Then an humblest speech could more prevail—
Had more of truth, and patriot rage,
Than all that linger through this age
Een all at once together bound,
One inane senseless world of sound !
Oh 1 bid our modern M.P.s cease
This war of Party, and in Peace
Learn to sincerely legislate,
Not for themselves, but for the state. .
FASHIONS FOR NOVEMBER.
TARTANs will be almost universally worn ; but in schools it is not un-
likely that stripes will be prevalent. Boys' jackets will have the customary
trimming; and the back will be made smart by being cut on the cross
with a thin rouleau of cane laid on rather lavishly.
In windy weather, the hats of the gentlemen and the bonnets of the

ladies are thrown a good deal off the head ; and we have seen a novelty
in umbrellas, the silk being curiously slit into ribbons.
The blouse is now giving way to the York coat, warranted to weigh half
an ounce; and we have seen one or two specimens of Tweedish wrappers,
at fourteen-and-nine, which will no doubt be worn almost universally.
Rowing-shirts are disappearing fast; but their place is, in some cases,
supplied by the blouses, which, fitting close to the skin on the Corazza
principle, are found desirable for wear in winter.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The
CHINESE EXHIBITION AT KNIGHTSBRIDGE.
civil Govern MENT in chi N.A.
THE civil institutions of China claim to be fashioned upon the exact
model of a wise family government. The Emperor is invariably
spoken of as the “Father of the Nation,”—and justly for the most

anxious parent never whipped his children more frequently. Chinese
whipping, however, seems to be the very antipodes of English, for
there they often whip people's heads off. The astonishing rapidity
with which the heads of offenders are sometimes taken off is enough
to excite the jealousy of Monsieur Daguerre. The process, indeed,
is brought to great perfection; the execution is instantaneous—and
if the likeness is not striking, the executioner is. In busy times, we
should imagine that heads may be purchased there for about the
same price they are openly sold in the shops here—namely, one
penny. In the capital the operation is usually performed under the
immediate superintendence of the Emperor himself; in the provinces,
tunder that of the officer whose province it is.
FACE OF Tii e Count R Y.
The general face of China is flat, especially the nose. The only
prominent parts are called, in the mono-syllabic but expressive lan-
guage of the country, Tscheek Bones.
CHIN ESE I DEAS or BEAU-T Y.
Corpulence is considered a beauty in a man—so much so that people
seem to think but little of a slight acquaintance. On the other hand,
light ladies weigh heaviest in the scale of beauty, while heavy ladies
are made light of. However, there is no rule without an exception,
for the most celebrated Bell in Pekin weighs 128,000 pounds. So
general an objection exists to great feet, and such a great feat is it
thought to have small ones, that the feet of female children of five
years old are actually taken up and bound over not to grow any more.
Their soles thus become as small as Rochester soles, and they are as
easily caught, for they cannot walk straight; so that, like other small
soles, they might with more propriety be called slips. These tiny
lumps of deformity are dignified with the appellation of “Golden
Lilies,” a name which is supposed to have had its origin in the excla-
mation of a negro, who, on first seeing a Chinese lady's foot in a yellow
silk shoe, cried out, “O me Fader—dere's a lilly golden ting " And
yet how the negro could say this, when the same binding which checks
the foot won't let the knee grow, we cannot guess. Surely it is
not only a cruel but a short measure which cribs ten inches out of
every foot
cu it iOSITIES OF CHINA.
There are many curiosities in China; so many, that we must leave
travellers to discover them for themselves. One hint, however, may
help to save them time. In every city, town, and even village, they
may visit, they will find the greatest curiosity of the place in the pos-
session of the ladies.
A N-odd Man.
REI. IGION or China.
There are three sects—the Buddhist, the Taou sect, and the Con-
fucian. The two first are the more regular Chinese religions, which
will readily be believed when it is pointed out that one ends and the
other begins with T. These two religions would fain knock the third
on the head, but they can't, because it has no temples. The first is
decidedly a pacific sect, for they worship their “Fo,” and try to make
a friend of him. The second is a religio-philosophic sect. Its founder
has been called the Epicurus of China, from which we may reason-
ably infer that when Horace used the expression “Epicuri de grege
porcus,” he had a Chinese pig, if not a Chinese sty, in his eye. We
are not personally given to joking, but we think it very likely
that the humorous Dr. Kitchener, who ought to have been ap-
pointed by the Crown (and Sceptre) Gastronomer Royal at Green-
wich, if asked for a receipt for such a pig as this, would have
commenced thus:—“Take your Grecian philosopher, and stuff him
with some Chinese Sage.” The doctrines of Confucius are embodied
in nine volumes, which we recommend to the attentive perusal
of Messrs. Spode and Copeland, for they contain “The whole duty
of a Chinaman.” The sententious brevity of style in these cele-
brated productions often renders the meaning impenetrably obscure,
but this is an accident which will sometimes happen to the best-regu-
lated books. Confucius avoided subjects strictly religious, for he
admitted that he understood little concerning the gods, and his most
celebrated commentator, Choo-footze or Cheur-footze (how often has
it been said, that a servile commentator would like his idol's foot ()
confirms him.
1. AN Gu AG e or chi N.A.
We have neither time nor space to do more under this head, than
throw together a few hints for those who delight to trace the simi-
larity between the languages of distant and dissimilar countries, to
improve upon. Doubtless, were the subject closely followed up, some
exceedingly curious discoveries might be made. At the first blush
of the thing, no two languages can appear less like one another than
the English and the Chinese; and yet the Chinese call “rice” “nice,”
and “food” “good.” On first tasting “beer,” and being asked what
it was, they said “queer.” Again—“bread" was once held up to a
Chinese who had just dined, when, after looking at it attentively, he said
“fed.” Another being shown an immense “stick,” pronounced it “thick.”
A third had a high “wall” pointed out to him, and called it “tall.”
Even in sentences composed of two or more words, there is now and
then a close resemblance in the two languages. For example—a
Chinese soldier levelled an arrow at an English soldier, to whom he
was so close that, had the shot taken effect, the Englishman must
have been killed. Luckily the string of the bow broke, and the arrow
as well as the Chinaman's plan fell to the ground. The soldiers of
both countries simultaneously pronounced this “an-arrow escape.”
Many other instances might be adduced, but surely we have said
enough to whet the appetite of philologists. More than this can
hardly be expected from Punch, when Mr. Tradescant Lay, in his
admirable work “The Chinese as they Are,” distinctly informs us
that “the Chinese doctors who, at the command of Kang-he, under-
took to compile dictionaries, did not understand the principles of their
own language.
CHINESE ARTS AND ARMS.
We shall not attempt a description of the arts in use by so artful a
people as the Chinese. Suffice it to say, that Chinese society is one
* Royal Society of Arts,” of which the Emperor is perpetual Pre-
sident, and every individual in the nation a life-member. It is due,
however, to the Royal President of this Royal Society to state that he
has never resigned on account of the members drinking so much tea;
on the contrary, he likes them to drink it. As to their arms– the
arms of the Chinese are almost as curious as the feet of their wives—
and these may be called, when it is remembered that we are at war
with them—the most attractive portion of the exhibition. Their
weapons are not numerous. Their swords, like all bad arguments,
may be said to cut two ways, for they sometimes kill themselves with

them instead of their enemies. ...Their guns are match-locks, and each

soldier who carries a gun, carries also a match-lock for himself,
though no match for us. Their cannon are so formidable, and so
fearfully constructed, that our soldiers, when they have captured one
(which they rarely succeed in doing unless they try), are actually
afraid to fire them for fear they should burst. It has been charged
against English tea-dealers that they have often sold sloe-leaves for
real gunpowder. We imagine that the Chinese must nuix some such
leaves with their gunpowder, for our soldiers consider it “uncommon
slow.” Their bows and arrows are perhaps their best weapons, for
if they hurt nobody else with them, at least they don't hurt them-
selves. We should be inclined to think that the most truly destruc-
tive of all their instruments of war are (strange to say) defensive
weapons—namely, their shields—for on these they paint such dread-
ful faces, that the very sight of them has been known to make English
soldiers fall down, and almost die—of laughing. The effect produced
on the nerves of weak people, when they behold specimens of all these
tremendous implements of destruction collected together in one spot,
may be imagined, but cannot be described. A tolerable notion of it
may be formed, when we state, that the Duke of Wellington, who has
been in several battles—some of them rather severe ones (considering
his opponents were not Chinese), and who is generally considered to
be a brarish man—that the Duke of Wellington, we say, when first he
found himself alone before the glass-case which contains them,
although a moment's reflection would have told him that they could
not be loaded, could by no means face it without a shudder, or rather
shrug of the shoulders; and “they do say” that he actually turned his
head away and smiled. What such effective weapons must be when
wielded by soldiers who are so proverbially brave, that a regiment of
them would not hesitate to face two or three of our men, provided our
men were unarmed, may be readily imagined. And, now, like some
learned reviewers, we have written such lengthy opening remarks of
our own, that we have no space left to extract from the work under
review. We shº’’ i.erefore conclude, by advising our readers most
strenuously to go to Knightsbridge and judge for themselves—assur-
ing them that (for all we have said) a more truly interesting exhibi-
tion was never opened in London. Half-a-crown is the only risk ;
and there is, in truth, no greater risk to this half-crown than there
would be to the whole crown of him who should stand for half-an-
hour before a Chinese battery, when such battery was in what they
would call, full earnest—though, in what our soldiers would call, full
play.
A CRITIQUE.
The Times. Lawson, Printing-house Square.
“Punch" has great pleasure in introducing this remarkably clever
newspaper to the notice of the whole world. It has been got up, apparently,
by some very talented young men; and, although it has not been esta-
blished more than fifty years, it has acquired a very respectable position in
daily literature, which there is every reason to believe it will maintain.
Already various imitations of it, concocted on the mock-turtle principle,
but less happily simulative of their original, have appeared, and have not,
it seems, been, for the most part, without their patrons. For instance,
there is the Morning Herald, which, in accordance with its title, crows, in
mimicry of thunder, though it makes but little noise. Much valuable
information, “PUNch’” assures his readers, may be gleaned from the un-
º little journal whereon he has undertaken to remark. The
umber at present before him contains, besides a very considerable
amount of not unimportant advertisements, a good deal of interesting—
“Punch " may say useful—matter. The spirited proprietors have cer-
tainly spared no expense in procuring efficient contributors and establishing
an extensive connexion. They evidently have reporters at Liverpool and
Manchester; and, in the Number in question, there is a letter, which has
come all the way from Lisbon, where also they appear to keep a cor-
respondent, who seems a clever man. The editorial remarks on the
King of Prussia, and Germany, in connexion with cotton-twist, display
somewhat enlarged views; while those respecting the Finsbury Festival,
and the recent display of petticoat, oratory, are couched in a light,
happy vein of sportive satire, indulged in at the expense of Dr. Epps and
Mr. Thomas Duncombe on the one hand, and Miss Mary Ann Walker on
the other; whereby the self-admiration of those persons must have been
pleasingly titillated. The writer of them evidently enjoys a tolerably
extensive familiarity with the Latin poets, as well as with the bards
of our own country; and his views with regard to he “Rights of
Woman” are rather sensible. The “Shipwrecks on the Goodwin Sands”
are neatly treated, and the “Singular Occurrence at Hammersmith’’
is nicely told. The “Money Market and City Intelligence” is cha-
racterised by considerable accuracy, and the “Court Circular” is
nearly as funny as our own. Indeed, it has been whispered to “Punch,”
that this is a contribution from the Court Jester, whose office has
always been kept up, though it has been limited of late years to the com-
munication of the above-mentioned notice to the papers. The article
“Foreign Cattle at Smithfield” is interesting to the grazier; as is the
Losing his FLEsh.
extract, so judiciously culled from the Hereford journal, touching the
Hereford October Fair. The following passage is highly graphic, and
susceptible, in “Punch's" opinion, of comic illustration :-"We heard
an extensive farmer offer to lay a wager that he would buy at least fifty
beasts at 44d. per lb.” The “Case of Embezzlement at Warrington” is
a thrilling romance in real life, and the Police Intelligence, generally, is
much more interesting and better written than “Jack Sheppard.” The
Accidents and Sudden Deaths are soul-harrowing ; and the story “Sheep-
stealing Extraordinary” is narrated with extraordinary ability. . The
Report concerning the “Pauper Children of St. Pancras” is highly in
structive, and, among other things, throws considerable light on the man-
ners and language of vestrymen ; as, for instance, in the ensuing sentence
—“Mr. Cooper observed that all Mr. Barnes had said was perfect non-
sense.” The “Sporting Intelligence” is racy. The “Births” will be
eagerly perused by the friends and acquaintance of the papas and mammas
implicated ; and the “Marriages”—“PUNch’’ wishes there had been
more of them—will, he doubts not, be extensively read by the fair sex;
while, among the more tragic portions of the news, the “Deaths,” from
the emphatic conciseness with which they are related, will be found
strikingly effective. To the bill-discounter and gentleman of the Hebrew
persuasion, the quotations from the Stock-Exchange List will prove at-
tractive reading. Aumong the advertisements, there are several that are
very droll, and one in particular respecting H-'s Ointment exhibits
the most amusing mendacity. Another is so remarkable for the poetical
play of fancy whereby it is distinguished, that “Punch" begs to quote
part of it :—
“Thanks, generous triends; we thank ye, one and all:
Our best bow make for every friendly call;
For two years' favours our gratitude declare,
And promise future orders every attention—care.
On public opinion—mighty tide l—we roll,
And bear our name from centre to the pole.
In deeds, not words, our gratitude proclaim—
Who have had coats find something in a name.”
“PUNch” must not omit to mention a certain curiosa felicitas, of which
examples abound in this smart journal. He alludes not only to the style
of its leading articles, but also to certain statements relative to matters of
fact. Thus, in the “Trade Report,” it is mentioned that on the previous
day “630 bags of Java,” and “ 720 of Mauritius,” were offered for auc-
tion. Java and Mauritius mean coffee ; here, therefore, is accuracy of
information combined with comicality of expression. In like manner,
“20 Maranhams,” “ 130 Egyptians,” and “600 Surats,” are represented
as having been sold at Liverpool, October 24. However, Liverpool is not
in Turkey, nor has the slave-trade been revived in England. Some of these
phrases are imbued with a poetic melancholy, as : “Manchester.—There
is very little doing, and the market looks heavy.”
“Punch” is sorry to say, that candour compels him to qualify the above
amount of commendation with one word of dispraise. He has no objection
to everybody entertaining his particular notions, so long as they do not
clash with his own ; but he strongly disapproves of the political principles
of the Times. In his humble opinion, Universal Suffrage, Wote by Ballot,
Paid Representatives, the People's Charter, the Social System, Abolition
of Matrimony, Community of Property, Extinction of Religion, and Uni-
versal Anarchy, are the grand objects for which every true patriot should
contend. He trusts, therefore, that his readers will be on their guard
against the slavish doctrines of subordination and morality, whereof this
otherwise unobjectionable journal—which with this caution we will now
leave in their hands—is the obstinate advocate. The Times will repay
perusal.

THE MEDICAL STUDENT.
(New Series.)
- chapter I.-MERELY PRELIMINARY.
Fon the first time since we have been permitted to supply conti-
nuous papers to the columns of PUNch, we have discarded the term
physiology, from the head of our articles. It is true we borrowed it from
France, and as long as we kept it to ourselves in England, it was all very
well; but a crowd of imitators—professors of the sincerest flattery—have
one IN HAND, two IN cRib.
scrambled after us, including a contributor to the New Monthly.
“The cat may “A,” the dog will have his day;” and we now drop the
title, not yet considering ourselves quite sunk down to the level of the
lady-bird humourists of the pincushion school of literature, who, with one
exception, supply that periodical.
With the exception of discarding this word, then (with a full permission
for those to make what use they can of it who stand in need), we shall go
on precisely as heretofore, in our usual manner; unshaken even by the
amusing attempts to “elevate' our style made in the fashionable morning
paper, with its nice affection of aristocracy—its nervous quivering and
sensitive shrinking from the least contact with the every-day and common-
place ; its pretended ignorance of natural society, and its alleged inability
to exist anywhere but in the perfumed boudoirs of May-Fair, with the
coarse day-light modified by rose-coloured curtains, and the vulgar air
overcome by the incense of costly pastilles.
The present period of the year abounds in subjects for the exercise of
that genius peculiar to the writers of small poetry for annuals and pocket-
books. The fall of the leaf is, of course, the first thing that suggests
lyrical effusions to their minds, from the advertisements of Rowland's
Kalydor, and cheap tailors, in the newspapers, to “Stanzas on an Autum-
mal Evening,” in a fashion-book; and they write about the brevity of
man's life—how one race succeeds another, the return of spring, and
other pretty and affecting sonnets. We will take an analogy, but in prose,
from the same source, in speaking of the medical students—with the
exception that they succeed each other, just at the time when the leaves
cut their sticks, or, more correctly, their stems and branches; and, in
consequence, new faces are always to be met with, about this period, at
the medical schools.
Our old friends Muff, Manhug, and Rapp, with their companions, have
at last departed—like certain actors, they have had many farewell appear-
ances, but now we shall never see them again. Jack Randall is the only
link remaining that connects the chain of new men with the past; in fact,
he describes himself “as the last trump card of the hospital pack that
has now shuffled and cut itself; and he may be well defined as the Knave
of Arts, or Dodges.” He is indefatigable in his endeavours to arouse the
pupils to a sense of their duties, and a proper degree of spirit in con-
ducting themselves as becomes medical students in general, and those of
London in particular.
The first information of the proceedings at the school, with which we
can furnish our readers, will be better conveyed in a letter sent by Ran-
dall to Mr. Muff a few weeks after the old party had left the establish-
ment. This invaluable document was written upon several leaves of
paper, clandestinely torn out of a note-book belonging to a freshman who
sat at his side in the class, and fastened together with pins and wafers.
The despatch ran as follows:–
MR. RANDALL’S LETTER.
“To Joseph Muff, Esq., SURGEoN, Clodpole.
“Ullow, My Boy I
“Here we are again—how are you ? Scribo has paucas lineas (you see
I am working at my Latin) during the lecture now going on upon “the
reflex nervous function;” which, as I merely hope to practise as a sur-
geon and apothecary, will be of as much use to me hereafter, as the
minute anatomy of the moon. The subject has now lasted for six weeks,
and does not seem likely to finish for as many more. However, old Twad-
º thinks I am taking copious notes of all he says—so it is just
as Weil.
“I am anxious that you should know how we are getting on, which is
pretty well, considering, although there has been an immense importation
of dummies from the country. They seem, however, very tractable; and
I have got them to leave off shoes, wear straps, adopt short pipes whilst
they are at work, and subscribe for a set of single-sticks and boxing-
gloves, by which, I tell them, they will understand the demonstration,
and learn the action of the muscles better than from all the books, lec-
tures, and diagrams ever printed, given, or invented. I have also con-
trived to dispose of my medical library to them upon very advantageous
terms, and I bought a case of scalpels at the pawnbroker's—you remember
uncle Balls—which I sold immediately afterwards for a pound, to a young
gentleman red-hot to commence his first dissection. I also put a skull up
to be raffled for by twenty members, at a shilling each. I only got nine-
teen, so I threw the other myself, and won it, as well as all the money.
So you see we are going on in the right way.
º:
~~
Giving A General satisfaction.
“We have an immense card here in the shape of a new man—a Mr.
Cripps—with whom I think we can have some fun. He has entered the
profession rather late in life, and works like a horse, taking in all sorts of
lies you choose to tell him, for the sake of information. He bought a box
of chemical experiments the other day, and as he chanced to leave it in
the pupil's reading-room, we changed all the tests. You cannot think
what a hobble it has got him into—all he thinks will be red, turns green,
and all the blues are pink, whilst he nearly blew himself up yesterday,
through rubbing together some hydro-chlorate of potash and sulphur in a
mortar, which of course exploded. This was because we told him it was
the best way to make calomel, which they would be certain to ask him
about when he went up to ‘the Hall.”
“Some of the men here are talking about starting a medical society, to
argue about different cases, once a week. I am drawing up a lot that
never happened to get the knowing ones into a line, who read long papers
which they copy from books, and call their own. Of course all this must
be knocked on the head. I shall wait quietly until I get a majority on
my side, and then some evening I shall vote that the funds be appro-
priated to the formation of an harmonic society, at which I have no objec-
tion to be the chairman.
“The nice good young men of our hospital are very angry with Puncil,

Thry may laugh, they may jeer, they may call me a Guy,
They may sneer, they may quiz, they may titter or grin ;
But if I am able to keep myself dry,
Oh why should I get myself wet to the skin?
Then, round me, to shelter my shoulders and back,
This piece of old oilskin I closely will draw;
And, oh! if I chose to appear in a sack,
To hinder my doing so, where is the law P
Then laugh even louder, ye sycophant crew,
A Mackintosh if I'm unable to get :
Because this old oilskin is jeer'd at by you,
Am I to reject it, and walk through the wet P
To imprudence so flagrant I'll not be provoked:
But onwards, the Guy that I am, will I range;
For, oh! if my linen were thoroughly soak'd,
Say, where shall the Seedy One look for a change P

PUNCH*S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER XVI.-PIOW TO Choose A Friend : The PURPOSES OF
FRIENDShip. A Story OF “Friends.”
MY dear Boy, Choose your friend as you would choose an
orange; for his golden outside, and the promise of yielding much,
when well squeezed.
Lord Chesterfield has beautifully and truly remarked: “whatever
is worth doing at all, is worth doing trell.” This axiom applies admirably
to the treatment of a friend.
There is no surer evidence of a contented meanness of spirit in a
young man than a disposition to club a friendship with merely his
equals in life. Whilst on the other hand, the ardent, speculative
mind, that looking abroad for a communion of feeling, selects its
Pylades from the rich and powerful, indicates a just knowledge of the
whole and sole purpose of human friendship. What is its object
Is it not to succour and assist the man elected for its twin brother?
And how are you, poor and powerless, to expect aid and practical
consolation from one as helpless as yourself? Can the naked clothe
the naked Can the beggar bestow alms upon the beggar? No; be
assured of this truth; it is to defeat the purpose of all friendship, it
is to frustrate its most beneficent and humanizing end, to ally your-
self with any companion, who cannot better your fortunes; to whom
you cannot on all occasions resort, either for the interest of his
word, or for what must be indisputably acceded to be the purest, the
noblest offering of the human soul, ready money.
For a poor man to boast of a poor man for his friend is to flourish in
the face of the world an empty purse. To such a man a poor friend
is a clog, an incumbrance; a reduplication of his own wants; an
exaggeration of his own squalor. What should Lazarus do but
burden Lazarus : To enter into such a compact is to make friend-
ship a bubble—the echo of a name—an empty sound !
How different your condition with Gloriosus for your friend The
jewel on your finger is a brilliant evidence of the value of friendship.
The horse you sometimes ride proves to yourself and all the world
that amity is a substantial matter; the burgundy, that at Gloriosus's
table beams in your eyes, and circulates in your system, makes your
bosom glow with the sweetest feelings; and you lay your hand upon
your heart, and feel friendship to be a lovely, a most sufficing thing
Thus, you build an altar to friendship in your very self. You are a
breathing, moving, satin-cheeked evidence that friendship is not,
what cynics and misanthropes call it, a thing of air—the dream of
fools.
Can you do this if you hang upon the skirts of your fellow-poor
No, my son. So therefore, if you have a nature capable of friend-
ship—if you would prove to the world the surpassing beauties of the
feeling which poets have sung, and sages melodiously discoursed of,
—hang on to the rich, select the man of wealth, and him only for
your friend; dwell and glitter in his bosom like his diamond shirt-
stud.
Possibly, there may be ill-mannered people who for this will call
you toad-eater. Let them : I will in few words, and from truthful
history, teach you how to answer them.
The ill-natured antiquaries of the Netherlands with bile against the
politest nation upon earth—of course, I mean the French—have
declared that what are now quartered as the lilies of France, were
originally toads. The Abbé Dubos gives a reasonable excuse for
this ; an excuse that ought to disarm malignity of its sneer: the
French could not help it. The Germanic nations—the French then
being a part of them—having engaged all the courageous and terrible
birds and beasts, such as eagles, lions, griffins, dragons, and the like,
left nothing for the poor Franks, who were, in the strait, compelled
to go to the puddles for their bearings, and so contented themselves
with a toad. This toad, in process of time, became metamorphosed
into a bee: for on the 27th of May, 1655, the Curé of St. Brie, at
Tournay, wishing to enlarge his wine-cellar, the workmen he had
employed upon that benevolent object, came plump upon the coffin of
King Childeric I. It was then discovered that upon his Majesty's
royal robe were sewed innumerable golden bees. These were sub-
sequently removed to the royal cabinet of France. Whether, how-
ever, they took flight at the revolution, I know not. “I do not doubt,”
says the Abbé Dubos, “that our bees, by the ignorance of painters
and sculptors, have become lilies.” Lilies, that, according to Mal-
herbe, were once especially fragrant in the nostrils of John Bull.
“A leurodeur l’Anglaisse reláchánt,
Notre amitié va recherchant.
Et l'Espagnol, prodigc merveilleux,
Cesse d'être orgueilleux.”
You may ask me, my son, what has this antiquarian rigmarole
about the toads, the bees, and the lilies of France, to do with the
lesson I would propound on the beauty of friendship My son, be
instructed.
Let the envious call you toad-eater; make you of that toad a
golden bee, still gathering honey from your friend, and turning it to
your private advantage. And then, if detraction accuse you of
hoarding from the treasures of your Pylades, declare your friendship
to have no bee-like propensity whatever, but that it grows in your
heart, pure and odorous as-
“The lily, lady of the flowering field.
Thus, when the world throws the toad in your face, take a lesson
of the Frenchmen, and declare there was never aught toad-like in
the water : but always, always a lily Toads, you never eat, you
only snuff, lilies.
Friendship, like love, may, I know, have very odd beginnings. I
speak, however, of the friendship of simpletons and pennyless en-
thusiasts. I will narrate to you what I think a very comical
incident, illustrative of the mysterious working of friendship.
Lieutenant Montgomery had seen much military service. How-
ever, the wars were over, and he had nought to do, but to lounge as
best he could through life upon half-pay. He was one day taking his
ease at his tavern, when he observed a stranger evidently a foreigner,
gazing intently at him. The lieutenant appeared not to notice the
intrusion, but shifted the position. A short time, and the stranger
shifted too, and still with unblenched gaze he stared. This was too
much for Montgomery, who rose and approached his scrutinizing
intruder.
“Do you know me, sir?” asked the lieutenant.
“I think I do,” answered the foreigner. He was a Frenchman.
“Have we ever met before ?” continued Montgomery.
“I will not swear for it ; but if we have—and I am almost sure
we have,” said the stranger. “You have a sabre cut, a deep one, on
your right wrist.”
“I have,” cried Montgomery, turning back his sleeve, and display-
ing a very broad and ugly scar. “I didn't get this for nothing, for
the brave fellow who made me a present of it, I repaid with a gash
across the skull.”
The Frenchman bent down his head, parted his hair with his hands,
and said—“You did : you may look at the receipt.”
The next moment they were in each other's arms. They became
bosom friends for life.
HORRIBLE IMPOSITION.
We had thought the Income Tax was bad enough ; but the Observer of
yesterday announces an impost of a still more unjust and obnoxious cha-
racter. Our contemporary tells us, without expressing any indignation
on the subject either, that, in order to give effect to King Arthur at Drury
Lane, it has been determined to tar the talent of Mr. Stanfield. King
Arthur—being a monarch—must of course be supported by taxing some-
body; but is it not shameful to tax talent, particularly such talent as that
of Mr. Stanfield :

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN ESSAY ON THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF
ADVERTISEMENTS AND ADVERTISERS,
WITH SUNDRY CRITICAL REMARKS THEREON.
BY JAC O B D R Y AS DUST, F. S. A.
Advert IsiNg has gradually become a science of the greatest im-
portance and grandest aims. Like steam, the unnoticed infant, has
expanded into a giant, whose influence is felt everywhere. My daily
walks along the Strand are enlivened and made profitable by the
receipt of gratis essays on “the means of procuring comfort in shaving
for 6d. a year.” A man in boards, preceding me, with a dignity wor-
Done UP IN FANCY BOARD3.
thy of his office, calls attention to the momentous fact that “the best
hats in the world are to be bought for 4s. 9d.”—whilst on his own
head he exhibits one of the novel and ingenious shape of a salad bowl
provided with a rim, in order to prove his assertion. Behind me pro-
gresses a revolving pedestal, producing to the public's astonished and
delighted gaze, a row of coats shaped like portmanteaus, this is closely
followed by a huge van—all too small to proclaim the manifold vir-
tues of “the patent wire-wove ventilating wig,” which the inventor
informs us “supersedes the necessity of hair.” “The original little
dust-pan” on wheels, causes a glow of astonishment as to what can
possibly be the proprietor's notion of a great dustpan—whilst a peri-
patetic blacking bottle taking the air in company with an “anatomi-
cal model,” forms a feature in the London landscape which is duly
appreciated. The envelopes of my letters conjure me to “rush to
the city emporium,” if I want cheap frying-pans; and Mr. Smith of
Holborn, in a kind and friendly manner, admonishes me to “beware
of the man over the way.”
My principal daily employment is that of reading the newspapers;
in them do I find this glorious art most fully developed, and the
Mahometan cry of “In the name of the Prophet—Figs,” repeated in
delightful modulations. The advertiser of the present day, like a
cunning fowler, disguises himself and the trap, pouncing on his victim
suddenly and when least expected. With what supreme contempt
do we read the announcements of bygone years “John Jones sells
by the grace of God, and direct from Manchester, the very best calico
at 10d. a yard.” The attention is now riveted by “important news,”
mo doubt, a revolution or an earthquake, and the enquiring mind is
thus made to know that if it have corns, it should use “the Universal
Solvent.”—To “War in China,” the officer's lady turns anxiously for
some intelligence of the absent, when Captain Pidding recommends
his tea to her favourable consideration, as being that imbibed by Lin
himself. “One hundred guineas reward,”—you discover, is not
offered for the apprehension of one who has been using his master's
keys or name, but as a premium for picking Chubb's locks.
With generous earnestness some entreat the public to be ill, in
order that it may have the pleasure of being effectually cured by
“the real original Balm of Botheration,” or “self-sustaining cordial.”
Indeed, I cannot help thinking that death, in the present day, must
be the result of wilful negligence or paltry economy, as it can be
avoided by expending thirteen-pence-halfpenny in the purchase of
“Frampton's Pill of Health.” Mr. Holloway, with that modesty
which is the invariable attendant on real merit, declares that his
“ Universal Ointment” will mend the legs of men and tables equally
well, and be found an excellent article for frying fish in. Dr. Willis
Mosely answers with a vengeance Shakspeare's question, “Canst
thou minister to a mind diseased ?” by undertaking, “from motives
of benevolence rather than gain,” to cure all nervous affections, in-
cluding “indecision, groundless fear, incapacity for business, wretch-
edness and delusion.” “The Devonshire Herbaceous Galvanic Pill”
is for supplying everybody's inside, “with a due quantity of the
electric and galvanic fluid,” without which the proprietor thinks
“the wheels of life cannot be properly greased.” “A clergyman's
widow” vouches for the efficacy of “The Roseate Cordial discovered
by means of a dream,” which it appears “she takes every day after
dinner, and finds a wonderful increase of spirits therefrom.” “Old
Parr's Life Pills” were left, I presume, as a legacy to these who do
not desire the annoyance of attaining the age of one hundred and
forty years. -
Some advertisements form capital exercises for youth in the Greek
and Latin languages. I, who am a plain man (at least, so the ladies
say), cannot discover from its title whether “Wenn's Gypso Kliba-
non” be eatable or not. “The Ludgate Hill Nectar” certainly
defines its own properties very exactly, and I shall try if the patentee
will send me a quartern. But my mind is lost in a perpetual maze
of admiration at the talent of those who invent, not only the articles
themselves, but such mellifluous names for them as “The Hierokos-
ma,” “AEthereal Oleine,” “Rypophagon Soap,” “Catoptric Lamp.”
“Elmes's Arcanum,” “Winn’s Anticardium,” and “Panclibanon Iron
Works.”
Who would imagine that the Lyric effusion headed “Envy,” was
in praise of the “Moses Taglioni;” or that “How beauteous is the
Morn of Life” would usher in Rowland's Macassar Oil I am often
surprised to miss the illustrious Warren's name from the list of
British poets—with what consummate art does, he rouse the soul by
his exquisite sonnet about the two cats and the Wellington boots
The polish of the verses is only equalled by that of the boots.
The announcements of public companies always command my
attention. The “Aberdeen Eel-pie Company,” for the diffusion of
cheap and good eel pies, will no doubt be a lucrative concern,
rivalled, perhaps, by “The Independent National Pickling and Pre-
serving Company.” “The Farmer's Hailstone Company,” for pro-
viding the agricultural population with that material, has certainly
astonished the preconceived notions of many Londoners, and thus my
heart in silence
A friend of Mr. Dryasdust, in order to account for this abrupt
termination, begs to say, that respected gentleman, overpowered by
the importance of his subject, and the gin and water he considered
it necessary to inspire himself with, is, at this present moment,
reclining with his head in the slop-bason, and appears likely to sleep
till next week.

For I feel that thy loss I can never replace,
That thy death will but leave me to weep and deplore.

PUNCH ON THE QUEEN'S HEAD.
UNCH, a week or two back,
took it into his own head to
present that of Her Majesty to
7 the world, under the title of
“a proof before letters,” little
dreaming at the time that he
should excite the rage of the
authorities at the Stamp Office.
We have, however, been ap-
plied to on this head, and been
compelled to give up the valu-
able block, under the threat of
official vengeance. The Com-
missioner of Stamps came to
our Office, and having dashed his fist on the counter, with a vehe-
mence that sent our boy into hysterics, and paralysed our pub-
lisher, he drew on his glove (a washable one-and-ninepenny) after
the manner of the late Mr. Kean, and paced up and down for several
minutes in front of the slight screenwork that divides us on the
south from our neighbour the milliner. Our boy had fled into the
friendly recesses of a nest of book-shelves, “for safety and for suc-
cour;” but our publisher having caught a glimpse of the figure of
Pu Nch above him, felt suddenly inspired, as the Crusaders did when
they got a peep at the sacred banner, and he boldly asked the agi-
tated Commissioner his business. With a sardonic grin, that brought
the people in from the Pannuscorium (our northern neighbours) to
know what was the matter, the Commissioner took a solemn oath,
after the fashion of the Duke of Gloucester, that he would not dine
until he saw (not Hastings's, but) the Queen's Head, and it was ulti-
mately arranged that the block should be placed in the hands of the
Government.
It seems that the authorities suspect the existence of an organised
plot to reduce the postage from one penny to nothing at all ; and the
Commissioner feared that Punch would aid the scheme, by enabling
people to cut the Queen's head out of his periodical, and use it to
place upon their letters. There have certainly been dark rumours
of an intention to use over again certain stamps that have been
already used, and there are mysterious allusions to collections that
are in progress of old stamps, under pretext of papering rooms, but
really with the intention of defrauding the Post-office and ruining the
revenue. Punch can lay his hand upon his stomach, and affirm that
he had no evil intention in bringing the head of the Queen to the
block of his wood-cutter. PUNch is all loyalty, from the top of his
cap to the tip of his slipper; and as to the revenue, he does all he can
to assist it, by consuming as many articles as he can, and making an
enormous profit of his work, for the mere patriotic pleasure of paying
the income-tax. Punch is excessively like Caesar's wife in one
respect—for he must not be suspected. -
No More blood
PETTICOAT ASCENDANCY —UNIVERSAL PEACE i
At the meeting lately held at the Rotunda, to commemorate Miss Mar-
tineau's magnanimity (which those who were present would, no doubt, be
glad to have the chance of imitating) in refusing a pension, a gallant
colonel is reported to have said, that, were the collective unwhisperables
of creation, and the prerogative annexed to those garments, in the posses-
sion of the ladies, there would be an end to warfare.
“Oh, Colonel Thompson—Colonel Thompson, oh!"
Thus far you are right, certainly. Domestic strife would cease of
course, because the apple of discord would be past fighting for. But
“PUNCH." must beg to dissent, toto coelo, from your general position, and
to adduce, in refutation thereof, a few considerations.
In the first place, one Horatius Flaccus, on historical grounds, directly
negatives the assertion—“Non fuit ante Helenam;”— you know the
rest; if not, accept the translation—
“For petticoat, ere Helen's day,
Was fellest cause of bloody fray.”—Punch.
That the sentiment of Mr. Flaccus is perfectly correct, there can be no
doubt. He had himself beheld it illustrated by a recent event, the conflict
between Mr. Marcus Antonius and Mr. Octavius Caesar (not Mr. Caesar),
a personage whose acquaintance he had afterwards the felicity of enjoying.
The former of these gentlemen was instigated to the contest, beyond all
peradventure, by Cleopatra's needle.
It has never been denied that woman, in the abstract, inspired the
Seven Champions to slay giants and dragons, while, in their particular
adventures, there was, in most instances, a lady in the case. Nor is it a
question that Richard Coeur-de-Lion, Dunois the Brave, and Company,
were stirred up, moved, and excited to go and poke the Saracens in the
stomach, by the same sweet incentive.
But history, it will be said, is an old comic almanac. Very well. Look
at the papers. When the Hon. Mr. D. has had an extra half ounce of
lead lodged by way of satisfaction in his brain by Colonel E., the bone
of contention has been, in most instances, a rib. So much for high life—
now for low. Philosophise in the Rookery, and the first case of nasal
bloodshed or ocular obscuration you meet with, inquire into its causation.
You will find, nine times out of ten, or “Punch” will eat you, that it has
been “along of Sal,” and teterrima indeed is the provocation to the
“affair of honour.”
Suppose we quit the “Christian,” as the country folks translate “Homo,”
and prosecute our researches zoologically. Go to the park—not Hyde
Park—and obserye how the bucks conduct themselves when under femi-
nine influence. They will be found as prone to go together by the horns
as so many jealous gentlemen. A little rural contemplation will acquaint
you with similar behaviour on the part of the ram and bull similarly cir.
ºumstanced. Or ponder in the poultry yard, and you will discover that
the combativeness of the cock, although now and then, like that of other
bipeds, aroused by chaff, is most frequently exerted by gallinaceous beauty.
There is no need to go into all the holes and corners of the animal king-
dom; but those who take that trouble will find the gentler sex everywhere
originating loggerheads.
“None but the brave,” says a gentleman of the name of Dryden,
“deserve the fair.” So think the fair themselves. Nor is it the
morally brave, by any means, who are the objects of their preference
Downright fistic, fighting, physical courage, is what they admire.
* Punch” would not advise any young man to go and boast to his lady-
love of having had fortitude enough to submit meekly to a horsewhipping,
or of having been kicked with impunity. Further, the word “ gallantry,”
which signifies the behaviour that pleases ladies, means, also, the taking
or demolishing of towns and castles—the heading of forlorn-hopes—and
shooting, cutting, and stabbing, with intent to killſ;–the hero performing

these achievements in the cannon's mouth. Finally, it is the universal
complaint of civilians that they are always “cut out,” as the phrase is, by
military men. In a race with a plain Esquire for a damsel's seat, ten to one
on a Dragoon. There has always been an affinity between Mars and
Venus. Now, how could petticoat ascendancy abolish war without cashiering
Captains Should some fair orator exclaim—“Never mind—Abrogate
the army—Disband the drummers—Dismount the dragoons—Melt the
muskets—Blunt the bayonets—Snap the swords—Spike the cannon;”—
“PUNch’’ would venture, in the most respectful manner possible, to .
answer—“WALKER!” The collective voice of womanhood cries out upon
such a damsel's desire ; and inquires, in its archest tones, whether she does
not wish she may get it ! No soldiers, indeed . Then, what is to become
of the uniforms—the gold lace—the mustachios ? What will quadrilles
be without ‘The Lancers ?’” “Punch * rather thinks he sees a senate
of young ladies voting for the extinction of the military ! He is going to
believe in a hurry, that the galaxy of loveliness which always attends a
review, glows with indignation at the demoralising spectacle—that his
countrywomen would hail, with acclamation, the dismemberment of the
Guards, the breaking-up of the Blues, the annihilation of the Coldstream.
He will allow himself to be persuaded—will he not —that the fair eyes,
which shine from the drawing-room windows of Pall Mall and Parliament-
street, upon the caps and corslets that escort Her *. to Saint
Stephen's, gleam with hatred and scorn on the display of brute physical
force in the parade below. He doubts not—oh, no l—that the handsome
young warriors who adorn the pages of albums and the backs of music-
books are intended for and regarded as caricatures. He makes no ques-
tion, certainly not, that the preference accorded to epaulettes in the
dance is all his visual organ. He acknowledges, feelingly, that the
predilection of the cooks and ladies'-maids for corporals and sergeants,
and the pride with which they hang, when it is their Sunday out, on the
arms of those scarlet heroes, while the nose is elevated and the chin
cocked at the humbler pretensions of the young officer of police, are all
affectation. He is a good-natured, believing soul—isn't he

JUVENILE BIOGRAPHY.
No. IV.-HUMPTY DUMPTY.
THE Humpties of Hampstead having formed an alliance with the
Dumpties of Downshire Hill, the families became at length united,
and an old feud was happily exchanged for a modern compact of amity.
“War,” says a recent writer, “is a state of hostility,” a truth which
the meanest capacity cannot be too mean to recognise. Quitting,
however, the philosophical tone we have for a moment been tempted
to adopt, let us plunge at once the pen of research into the inkstand
of fact, and having nibbed the former with the sharpness of discrimi-
nation, let us proceed to fill up the foolscap of biography.
On our first introduction to Humpty Dumpty, we find him seated
on a wall—a position no doubt intended to give us an idea of the
dangers of high stations—and the notification coming immediately
afterwards of his “great fall,” ingeniously involves a fine moral lesson,
preparing us artfully for the pathetic description that immediately
follows
º
That Humpty Dumpty occupied an exalted position, we cannot for
an instant doubt ; for the whole interest that attaches to his life, is
connected with the altitude in which he is found in the earlier phase
of his romantic history. That he was of consequence, we are con-
strained to admit; for, surely, “all the king's horses, and all the king's
men” would not have been employed in a futile effort, to “set Humpty
Dumpty as he was again,” unless the once haughty Humpty, now the
degraded Dumpty, had enjoyed the favour of royalty. He for whom
the stables of the sovereign were ransacked, and the whole troops
called out, could not have belonged to the common class; and the
greatness of the fall so delicately touched upon in the second line of
the poem, is splendidly carried out by the gorgeous description of the
gigantic but useless efforts to effect a restoration. It must have al-
ready struck the lettered reader, that there is a curious affinity be-
tween the Humpty Dumpty of the ballad, and the Cardinal Wolsey
of our own immortal bard—or Noster Shakspeare, as we feel proud
after the fashion of Cicero (who carried on business under the name
* Tully, and rented certain offices) in calling him.
Wolsey occupied a high station, so did Humpty Dumpty; the
Cardinal “had a great fall,” so had Humpty Dumpty; and, the latter
like the proud prelate alluded to, was unable to regain his former
eminence. There is no question but that Shakspeare, when he wrote
the following powerful passage, had Humpty Dumpty in his eye, and
indeed, he has almost followed the facts, if not the language of the
ballad, substituting however (perhaps for harmony, perhaps to show
his reading), the more classic name of Lucifer. The parallel would
have been complete between Wolsey and our hero, if a name had
been altered in describing the Cardinal's overthrow. The passage
would have then stood thus, and what it would have lost in euphony,
it would most assuredlyhave gained in graphic power:
And when he falls:
He falls like Humpty Dumpty,
Never to rise again.
The tendency of the English character has always been to typify
fact under the guise of fiction, and an egg has been fancifully se-
lected as the emblem of Humpty Dumpty. We are unable to divine
the origin of this graceful little allegory, unless it be that the body
of Humpty Dumpty, after his too fatal fall, was refused the common-
est sepulchral rites, and was not even placed in a shell for the pur-
pose of burial. But history has drawn a veil over this mournful
part of the picture, and we are unwilling to hunt down Humpty
to the grave, or disturb the deceased Dumpty in the repose to which
Fate has prematurely hurried him.
SONGS OF THE SEEDY.—No. XXIX.
Upon the stormy Strand I stood,
Where floweth population's tide
In one o'erwhelming human flood;
It was too much—I turn'd aside.
The gaiety I could not bear,
For coats were new, and boots were strong;
I look'd on all I had to wear,
And, sighing, glided from the throng.
Where am I now? 'tis not the Strand,
For there I'd not a living friend;
Whilo here, towards me many a hand
The urgent stranger doth extend.
Doth friendship prompt the eager grasp P
What can so many round me bring?
Ah! do they, like the yellow wasp,
Only lay hold of me to sting 2
They offer money—let me fly,
What can they mean? at length they tell,
In Jewish tones they say they'll buy
Great Heaven JWhat have I to sell ?
My dizzy brain sinks, lead-like, down ;
My degradation is complete;
They think I want to raise a crown
In Holywell's detested street.
A NAG-Gravate it.
Away, away, ye hungry crew;
I have old clothes—I'll own it now ;
But an I forced, thou huckst'ring Jew,
To part with them to such as thou?
They shall not crush my spirit proud;
No, no; ’twere better far to rally;
I do, and roar, in accents loud,
“Sell my old clothes! What, cheat my valet 1
Long years have roll'd away since then,
But I am cven secdier grown;
And when I pass those Jewish men,
They greet me in an under tone :
They say to me, “Old chap"; alas !
That term my tortured breast enrages;
“Old chap,” they whisper as I pass,
“Wen did ye pay yer valet's vages 7”

GRAND RAILWAY FROM ENGLAND TO CHINA.
THE provisional committee appointed to superintend the pre-
liminary arrangements connected with this great undertaking, beg to
submit to the public the following statement, with the view of forming
a Company to carry out this vast national concern, by shares, to con-
sist of an unlimited number.
In consequence of the extreme difficulty at present experienced in
making the voyage to China and India, together with the delay and
chances of shipwreck, it has been proposed, under the advice of an
eminent engineer, to construct a Railway from hence to the Celestial
Empire.
The plan suggested for the end in view is to
PENETRATE THE Bowels of THE EARTH
a Marr's Nest.
Through the MEDIUM or
A TUNNEL FRoM London To eanton,
pass ING THROUGh the
cENTRE of THE GloBE,
thus obviating altogether the enormous expense usually incurred in
the purchase of land, and avoiding the opposition likely to be en-
countered from hostile nations.
* From the Report made to the Committee by Sinko Shaft, Esq., the
engineer, who has descended some of the deepest wells and sewers in
and about the metropolis, and has sounded the earth in various places
at the outskirts, there is every reason to believe that the centre of the
globe consists of a mass of softest soil, except where intersected by
solid Rocks of GoLD AND silver,
AND
cAvERNs of PREcrous ston Es;
and that, from his examination, there is no reason whatever to
believe, as some have conjectured, that the earth is a mere crust, filled
in the interior with nothing at all—a state of things which would have
rendered the cutting of a tunnel through it an expedient of some
difficulty. As it is, however, the cutting will be exceedingly easy,
except where the masses of precious metals and jewels interpose an
obstacle ; but inasmuch as this material, when extracted, will be
immensely valuable, and, according to the most moderate calculations
of our engineer, will be many hundred times more than sufficient to
cover the entire expense of the undertaking, but little fear need be
apprehended upon this point.
It is intended that the Terminus in England shall be upon the
present site of
st. PAUL's cat HEDRAL, LoNDoN,
which, for the purposes of this undertaking, is to be pulled down.
With this view, the Bishop of London has already been applied to for
a grant of the land upon which it stands, with which application it is
confidently expected his lordship will readily comply ; should he,
however, object to the proposal, an application will immediately be
made to Parliament on the subject, when, of course, the church will
at once be placed at the disposal of the Company.
It is calculated that the journey will be accomplished as soon as the
passengers get from one terminus to another. As the Railway will
pass immediately under
Mount vesuvius ;
a station will be erected there, at which trains will stop for the pur-
pose of taking in coals and lava, or Cyclops, should there be any
residing in those parts. Another stoppage will be made under the
MEDITERRANEAN,
with the view of getting a supply of water, which will be drawn down
through a pipe from the sea above.
From the calculations made by the Committee, of the probable
returns from the traffic, the most gratifying results may be antici-
pated ; and as the Company will doubtlessly convey all the Govern-
ment troops, and as the war in the East will in all probability be
everlasting (if not longer), and the annual consumption of soldiers
incalculable, the company may expect to derive a handsome income
from this source alone.
As regards the intermediate traffic between the two termini, there
is, from the recent investigations into the subject by the learned
members of the University of Nhowher, strong reason for believing
that the population, swallowed up at various periods by earthquakes,
as at Lisbon, Port Royal, &c. &c., have only disappeared from the
surface of the globe to colonise and people the interior. Should this
be proved to be the case, the most interesting results are likely to
follow, upon the establishment of this undertaking, which may be
the means at once of opening a market for our manufactures, and a
passage for
The IN HABITANTs
or
THE INTERIoR REGIons of THE EARTH,
of the most profitable and advantageous description. In addition to
which, it is confidently expected that most of the Continental nations
will establish
BRANch TUNNELs,
running into that of the Company, which will be both a most
advantageous source of revenue, and be the means of establishing an
immense field of commercial enterprise.
The works will be commenced as soon as a sufficient number of
shares shall have been taken, and immediately on obtaining possession
of St. Paul's, the shaft will be sunk, when every effort will be made to
bring the whole of the undertaking into a sinking condition.
Further particulars will be announced as soon as the Company is
formed, for which purpose the public are earnestly solicited to enter
their names as shareholders, and pay a deposit of five pounds to the
secretary of the committee, Mr. Stumpy, at the office of “Punch,”
who will give a receipt for the same, entitling the party, should the
undertaking be abandoned, to obtain it back again whenever they can.
THE HERNE BAY STEEPLE CHASE.
This exciting event in the annals of sporting came off last week
at Herne Bay, and was attended by four emigrants as well as the
seven or eight settlers at present residing in this sequestered colony.
A mopstick, with a pocket handkerchief at the end of it, did duty
for the steeple; and during the whole time of the chase, the men,
whose duty it was to fix it somewhere for a winning post, continued
in such a state of indecision, that before he had made up his mind
where to stick it up, the chase was nearly over.
Five horses had been entered to start. There was Mr. Tilburg's
black galloway, out of Straw-yard, by Gardener; and Mr. Somebody-
else's chesnut filly, out of Livery Stable, by Ostler. An emigrant from
London, on seeing the jockeys, was under the impression that the
Herne Bay Almanack probably fixes Guy Fawkes' Day somewhat
earlier than in our western latitude, and imagined that the fifth of
November was to be kept on the third in the remote regions of
Herne, whose wooden pier is an appropriate type of the heads of the
inhabitants.
Having thought it a mere waste of time to wait until the man with
the mop-stick had settled where to stick up the flag, the word was
given to start, when the snorting beasts, snuffing the air as if to make
up for the fracture of their own wind, started off at a smart hop
across a potato field. There they came to the first leap—which was
a stiff piece of brickwork, intended for a stove of some contemplated
house, in an imaginary street, when the steeds stood stock still, and

preferred taking a low mound of mortar, over which they deli-
berately walked; one of them, however, clearing a trowel on the
other side rather cleverly.
Having been goaded into a canter by their respective jockeys, the
horses came to the second leap, which was a contemplated drain, into
which the chestnut filly thrust his two front feet, and after a good
deal of stumbling and a severe application of the spur, recovered his
footing in a bed of winter cabbages, several of which he cleared, miss-

ing some of the loftiest with immense sagacity. The man with the
mop at length stuck it up, and Pink walked cleverly in—Won by
about seventy necks, amid the cheers of the settlers and emigrants,
all of whom arrived at the winning post long before any of the
horses got up to it.
The stakes were then served up with oyster sauce, and a Handicap
—consisting of a cap, handed round, was presented—about one thou-
sandth part filled with halfpence, to the winner.
The black galloway seemed to be a good deal distressed, and from
some moisture apparent at the corner of his eye, had probably been
crying. The chestnut filly did not show, for the livery-stable, being
on the road to the winning post, she could not be prevented from
bolting into it. Betting was 9 to 1 upon the field, and 86 to 2 upon
the mop-stick.
MONEY MARKET AND CITY INTELLIGENCE.
Foreign Funds are remarkably good, which partly accounts for our
enormous circulation. There were no Consols. in the market, though it
was reported that there was one at Boulogne. In shares, Grand Junctions
were at a discount, owing to the great scarcity of buttons.
The business on 'Change was very limited ; an offer of three pairs of
white Trousers for one of black, was made, but refused. However, five
Blouses were taken by a great capitalist for a Fustian Jacket.
The Tea trade was very dull, and the old women at the street corners
were almost frozen to death without disposing of a single cup.
The supply of Tallow is considerably smaller, through our being obliged
to sit up an hour later last night.
The Cotton trade was very dull ; but one small transfer was effected of
a handkerchief from the hat of a porter (which he had incautiously put on
the ground) to the pocket of an urchin.
SONGS OF THE FLOWERS.
No. VIII,_THE SONG OF THE DAFFYDOWNDILLY.
I'm a dashing Daffydowndilly,
And gaily I nod my head
To the pale and delicate Lily,
That stands in an opposite bed.
I do not bend to every breeze,
Nor yield to each zephyr's sigh,
“tue wind blows, it snows."
I'm one of those that act as they please,
And a careless flower am I.
I’m not a gaudy bauble,
In many colours dress'd,
But of all the birds that warble,
The plainest sings the best.
The sparrow is an ugly bird,
To anybody's view,
But its notes are more sweet than the screech that's heard
From the painted cockatoo.
To be colourless I’m contented,
For I'm not the garden's fop,
And indeed a flower that's scented,
Seems to carry a card of the shop.
Let others, in vases ignobly thrust,
On chimney-pieces lie;
But the Daffydowndilly, when perish it must,
On the spot where it lived will die.
“Excusez," as the duck said to the frogs.
STATE OF THE FRENCH MARKET.
WE have just received our despatches from Paris, per Laffittee,
Caillard. We stop the press to lay the following particulars before
our readers :—
VAUDEvil LEs are not much increasing. We only had fifty-five
last month, and not more than ninety-three are announced for next
next week; but Scribe is expected from Bicêtre in a few days, and
his arrival will doubtless give a new impetus to this languishing stato
of things. It is whispered in the theatrical circles that he has just
completed a new piece in seven acts and nine-and-twenty tableaur. It
is to be called “LE Ro1, LE REGENT, Et LE REGIcIDE ; or, Les
égaremens d'une téte royale.” The subject is taken from English history,
and is treated with that strict adherence to truth, for which the
author's “Verre d’Eau” is so justly celebrated. George the Third is
the hero of the piece; Hatfield and Margaret Nicholson have each
prominent characters in it; and the intrigue is not only afflicting, but
also most fastidiously true. They are both proved to be children of
King George's by a left-handed marriage, and their ingratitude sends
him raving mad. His insanity lasts for three acts, and a relapse is
occasioned by his receiving a letter from Napoleon, in which he
refuses the hand of his daughter, the Princess Charlotte, in marriage.
The piece ends with the Regent being proclaimed King of England,
boxing with Sheridan, Pitt, and all the ministers. Great things are
expected of this piece, which professes to give “une exposition juste et
colorée des maturs Anglaises.” The costumes, the domestic manners of
the St. James's Court, the leg of mutton and turnips for dinner, the
top-boots, the bob-wig, the strait-waistcoat, are all to be called into
requisition to aid the illusion of the scene. Scribe is to receive only
15,000 francs for the manuscript of this piece. Loud complaints are
everywhere made against this signal illiberality of the Directeurs. A
society is forming, they say, in consequence, to get up a troisième
Théâtre Français, to be raised by shares, and the shareholders to
receive a dividend on each night's performance. The plan is sure to
do, for Victor Hugo and Alexan DRE DUMAs are to write all the
pieces.
I hear some talk of Galignani building a large hospital out of the
immense fortune he has realised by his “five-franc filchings.” There
is only one thing that makes us disbelieve this munificence, and that
is, its coming from—a publisher.
The English, unlike the trees in the Champs Elysées, are taking
their leares as fast as wind and fair weather will let them. Meurice
says, “An Englishman couldn't enjoy his Christmas, if he hadn't
tasted a true London fog first.’
The “war-cry” has subsided un tout petit peu, though the English
residents are boiling over with indignation that no official notice has
been taken of the fruit-women of La Halle continually crying out
“Voici les Anglais deur pour un sou.” Mr. Henry Lytton Bulwer has
repeatedly drawn the attention of Lord Cowley to this public insult,
but having failed in awakening the jealousy of his lordship's breast,
we have great pleasure in informing our readers that he has felt it
his duty to tender his portefeuille, and that his lordship has been gra-
ciously pleased to accept it. He returns home with La Pique.
We may dip deeper into the contents of our estafette next week.
THE WEATHER &
DURING the late fog several gentlemen mistook other persons' pockets
for their own, which led to a very astonishing transfer of property. Some
APPRopniation clause.
members of the West-end Political Clubs have written to us, requesting
our opinion of this dark affair ; and we, as enlightened Politicians, have
no hesitation in giving it as our solemn impression that it is allowing to
the Emperor of Russia as it is utterly impossible that anything, myste-
rious can occur in Great Britain without His Majesty having a hand in
the business.

CHAP. IV.-The ABDUCTION OF PROSERPine.
DUCATION and boarding for young
ladies were, at the establishment kept
by Miss Cayane, of Syracuse, carried
on in a superior manner upon the usual
terms, the only extras being initiation
int the Eleusinian mysteries depart-
ment, fire-works, Berlin-wool embroid-
ery, and the mathematics. So exceeding-
ly pure were Miss Cayane's morals, and
at the same time, so sharp and pungent
were her lectures upon any little impro-
priety of her pupils, that she has im-
mortalised herself, by giving her name,
not only to a lake in Sicily, but also to
a certain description of red pepper,
now corrupted into Cayenne.
Hers was, indeed, a most aristocratic
establishment. She had the patronage,
not only of the surrounding nobility,
but also of the Gods, and amongst others, Ceres intrusted her with the
care of her child, Proserpine–a young lady of a peculiarly spirited dis-
position, very fond of buns and botany.
To preserve the health of her pupils, Miss Cayane was in the habit of
taking them out daily for an airing, and for this purpose formed them into
a double row upon perspective principles: that is to say, the tallest went
first, and so on till the line of young ladies grew fine by degrees and beau-
tifully less, getting down to the very juvenile class, which, by a poetical
figure, the mistress was wont to call the junior branches.
In one of these excursions, the academy having entered the botanical
gardens of Enna, they were allowed to separate, and to divert themselves
as best they pleased. Miss Proserpine having wandered about for some
time, went up to her governess, and dropping a graceful curtesy (she had
had two quarters' dancing), said, “Please, Miss, may I gather a bouquet!
Please, Miss, it is our music-master's day to-day, and he is very fond of
flowers.”
“Yes, my dear, but mind the bees, for they are very plenty about here.”
Away she scampered, and was so industrious, that she collected a nose-
gay large enough for the breast of Jupiter's coachman in a state procession.
At length she came to a magnificent Narcissus, which put forth no fewer
than one hundred flowers *.
“O, Miss P.,” exclaimed one of her companions, “won't you catch it
if you pluck that flower! Why it is intended for the next horticultural fête
at Syracuse.” -
“I don't care,” exclaimed the lovely flower-girl; “catch it or not,
here goes '''
As she stretched out her hand she perceived, on the other side of a rose-
bed, a remarkably dark-looking gentleman, making very minute observa-
tions of her through an eye-glass. She instantly drew back in affright,
thinking it was one of the gardeners; but on hearing an ejaculation which
sounded very like “Remarkably fine girl, by Jove "she knew it was only
an admirer, and made another attempt to pluck one of the flowers.
“Don’t don't ſ” exclaimed her schoolfellow, “who knows—it may be
enchanted l’”
“Law do you think so?—Well, now you mention it, I do smell a very
strong odour of brimstone.”
“And—my stars 1—look there between those trees I did you ever see
such a splendid post-chaise My gracious ! the horses have got such
long tails "
“Well, who cares —They won't miss one flower off this great bush of
narcissuses.”
She severed the fatal bud from its stem.—The deed was done !—the
dark man leapt the hedge—the companion screamed—Proserpine cried
“Don’t ſ” with all her might; but the intruder persisted—seized her
round the waist—carried her by main force to the carriage—promised
the post-boys several extra guineas if they'd “drive like blazes to the
blacksmith !” And off they started, for the Cyclops and Mount Etna.
Except the Wakefield and Turner affair, which happened a few years
later, no similar untoward event ever created a greater sensation. Miss
Cayane went into hysterics with the utmost promptitude, and the young
ladies screamed, or laughed, or cried, or sº or fainted, according to
their several inclinations; but all concurred in calling it a shocking thing,
and hoped it would end in a half holiday.
One of the teachers rushed home immediately, and sent a special mes-
senger to the minister of police—one Mercury of Olympus, and wrote
home to Proserpine's friends by the next post. The music-master hap-

ned to be there, and, rabid with the pangs of jealousy, ordered post-
orses from the inn to follow the fugitives. By the time it came,
“governess” arrived, and insisted on having a seat in the vehicle, as,
unless something were done, her school was ruined for ever.
Meantime Proserpine shrieked and screamed with that due regard to
the feminine propriety and modesty which she had been taught at Miss
Cayane's establishment to observe under such circumstances as she then
found herself placed in. Although no young ladies' lungs were ever in
better condition, yet all her cries produced little effect. In vain her
abducer promised her everything she could desire—unlimited credit at
the jeweller's, the mercer's, and the modiste's, together with as many
evening parties as she chose to give; yet she was not to be pacified.
“My dearest angel!” exclaimed her companion, “do not imagine that
rou § tire me by your shrieks—compared to the noises I am used to at
ome they are music. Go on, dearest—the louder and more piercing your
cries the better I like them.”
Of course Proserpine was silent almost immediately.
“My dear girl," he continued, “you do not know the good fortune in
store for you. I am Pluto–’”
“The -— ?” ejaculated the fair one, ehecking herself. “What, old
Bogie in earnest Law, why you are quite good-looking to what I thought
you were. What will mama say?”
On 1 on 1 on they galloped faster and farther than Harrison Ains-
worth's Dick Turpin when he rode to York. But their career was to be
checked. The more drunken of the post-boys got upon a grey mare,
and down she tumbled.
“The near leader, by all that's infernal 1" shouted Pluto.
“Don’t swear, please,” sighed Proserpine ; “it frightens me.”
The enraged lover heeded not this caution; but on getting out uttered a
volley of oaths, which made the ground shake, beneath them . . Whilst
repairing the damage, however, the sounds of wheels were heard in the
rear.
“Confusion what is to be done?” exclaimed the infernal god.
“Pray make haste,” shouted Proserpine, “or they will soon overtake
Pluto's rage vanished at these encouraging words; he flew into the
chaise, took the young lady in his arms, and by his fervent attentions so
shocked her, that she had no power to resist.
“Will you consent to be mine?”
“If you'll ask my mama.”
“Alas, I have done so, and she has refused me.—Ah, they are upon
us ! One word, and —”
“Yes,” replied the maiden, for fear they should be overtaken.
“Then down we go at once,” rejoined Pluto, and sure enough they did.
The earth opened, and they were on the banks of the Styx in no time;
where they were soon followed by Miss Cayane, for she drowned herself,
and being a schoolmistress, went of course to Hades.
Twelve months after Ceres having, like a great many other wise parents,
given her consent to what she could not prevent, Pluto and Proserpine
were married, upon the single condition that the latter should go home for
the holidays, which she regularly has done ever since during the dog-days.

INCOME TAX STATISTICS.
SoME curious calculations have been made by an assessor, from the
papers which have come into his hand, and as he has favoured us with a
perusal we have no hesitation in giving them to the public.
Out of forty returns below one hundred and fifty pounds a-year, two

the figure of an individual Wii. his thumb placed on the end of his nose;
and six had given poetical answers to the enquiries made of them. One
had drawn a series of circular figures with instructions to put that and
that together, for the purpose of determining the amount of the sender's
income ; and another individual had filled up the column that ought to
contain an account of his property with a reference to an official assignee
of the Bankruptcy Court. Several of the returns are copiously illustrated
with pen-and-ink sketches; and one contains the following graphic por-
trait of an infant, as the only return to be made, under the head of

THE MEDICAL STUDENTS.
CHAPTER II.-OF MR. SIMPSON BRIGGs.
It is generally the custom of biographers to commence their notice
of any individual with a mention of his birth and family, or at least,
some particulars of his early days; but in the present case it is impos-
Bible to do so.
rarily IMPREssions.
Although Mr. Simpson Briggs was as well known to the pupils of
the school as the porter of the hospital, or the bust of John Hunter,
—the former personage, however, never recollecting any of them in
return, unless they gave him half a-crown at Christmas, still
nobody was aware when he first entered his name as a student of the
establishment, or indeed, commenced the caricature of his education
generally. Some years back, when a party of medical lecturers out
of place, opened a cheap school up some court, as the “Arena of
Anatomy,” Mr. Simpson Briggs came there to dissect “just before he
went up.” The concern did not pay, and the classes broke up after
two sessions, one or two of its professors instituting the “Metropoli-
tan Theatre of Medical Education,” and at the introductory lecture,
there was Simpson with the same old black note-book—the same
small uncomfortable ink-bottle—and apparently the same old steel
pen, (contained in the same handle), drawing such diagrams as his
inventive genius led him to put down, and fancying that he was
taking notes.
Although the new school offered considerable advantages, with the
option of entering at once “to all the lectures necessary to pass the
College and Hall,” for fourteen pounds, or something of the kind;
and although one of the professors could lecture on everything, still
the “Metropolitan Theatre of Medical Education” did not flourish,
and when, at the end of the course, the six lecturers shared forty-five
pounds amongst them, they were so disgusted with the little rush of
students their talents had induced, that they retired in dignified con-
tempt from the lecture-room. Subsequently some went abroad “for
the benefit of their wives' health, which was very delicate,” and
others, not at all proud, opened blue-bottle shops at the corners of
streets in “populous and rapidly-increasing neighbourhoods,” and
one of an aspiring mind christened his establishment the “North
South East and West London Self-supporting Dispensary,” with
vaccination direct from the cow, advice gratis, and shilling tooth-
drawing. A very thin young physician, in shoes and spectacles,
attends for two hours each day to give the gratuitous advice; and a
drudge, at nothing a year, with permission to attend lectures, was
stuck in the shop to look after the retail, which included tamarinds,
lucifers, and Windsor soap.
When the last-named undertaking tumbled to pieces, Mr. Simpson
Briggs was not seen for some time. At length one day at Stanley's lec-
ture some of the Bartholomew’smen who knew him well, were delight-
ed to see him make his appearance, with his note-book as heretofore, a
new great-coat, and a fresh snuff-box, something about the size aud
shape of a portable shaving apparatus, with a looking-glass in the
lid. In answer to my inquiries, he replied, that he was come there
to dissect a little, “just before he went up,” and that he had entered
as house-pupil to a grºnder in the neighbourhood—a glorious chap,
who allowed pipes and half-and-half during his examinations, holding
his classes in the parlour of some public-house, and knew all the
“catch questions” of Apothecaries' Hall, as well as having copies of
all the prescriptions which the men presenting themselves had to
translate.
Two winter seasons passed by, and still Mr. Simpson Briggs was at
his post. He was perpetually dissecting, or rather marching up and
down the room in a black apron and oil-skin sleeves, somewhat
resembling a butcher who had been dipped in a tub of ink, overlook-
ing the men who were at work, and fancying himself a pattern of
industry. Nor did he neglect attending the grinding classes; but he
was principally remarkable for never knowing anything in the world
- ~-
about the subject he was examined upon. With this tardy imbibition
of knowledge, it is more than probable that he would have remained
there many years; but the grinder got elected to some permanent
parochial and medical situation, which being previous to the New
Poor Law Union regulations, was worth his acceptance; and Mr.
Simpson Briggs was again thrown upon the wide medical world.
It was a short time after this event that he entered to the school,
whose students and transactions we have from time to time chroni-
cled in our columns. During the days of Muff, Manhug, and Rapp, he
was little known, being naturally of a retiring disposition, although
nowise disaffected towards half-and-half. But now they had left ;
and Jack Randall being rather put to it for acquaintances who har-
monized with his own convivial temperament, soon got very friendly
with Simpson, both agreeing in their love of everything like leisure,
and a distaste for all kinds of hard mental industry.
“I say, Simmykins,” said Randall one day to Mr. Briggs, with
whom it will be seen he was upon tolerable terms of intimacy, “Have
you been long at this fun ?”
“Above a bit,” answered Briggs. “I have seen the rise and fall
of a few schools.”
“And why don't you go up "
“Because I don't feel confident. I think, though, I shall begin to
read next Monday.”
For seven years had Mr. Simpson Briggs been going to begin to
read next Monday.
“Why do you want to know " he added.
“Because,” said Jack, “I’ll begin to read with you. I can study
better with another fellow than I can by myself. Is the heavy good
in your neighbourhood 2"
“Slap—and such prime birdseye at the corner shop. When will
you come 1"
“Why, whenever you like: I'm always game,” replied Randall.
“Well then—say to-morrow night.”
“Ah—to-morrow night—I can't. I’m going to a concert in Drury
Lane, and a ball at the Lowther Rooms afterwards; and I don't
think I shall read much after that.”
“Well, the next night then.”
“Let’s see. The next night a man in Lincoln's Inn has asked me
to punch and rats.”
“Punch and rats l’”
“Yes; in his rooms—a regular lark—I believe you. He buys
some rats and hires a terrier. We let them all loose in the room,
and then get on the shelves of the book-case to see the fun.”

“Such a brick his name's Warment. He wants the chambers of
the man underneath him, so he has put up a set of gymnastic poles
in his own rooms, and a lot of us meet there to exercise. I think
we shall drive him away soon.”

“I should think so,” observed Simpson.
“If he don't take the hint, we shall get up quintets for the cornets-

“Well, I see you won't come this week; 1 shall begin, however,
as soon as I have finished “Pickwick.’ Good bye.”
And Mr. Simpson Briggs having put on his apron and sleeves, and
walked about the dissecting-room for a quarter of an hour with an
old scalpel in his hand, singing something from “Norma,” with his
own words, finally went home to dinner, satisfied that he had done
his daily work with credit to himself.
In a new piece at Sadler's Wells, called the Fire-Damp, the chief part
is sustained by Mr. Dry. How Damp and Dry can get on together remains
to be seen; but not even Dry can be expected to continue what he is,
while he is subject to have a Damp thrown upon him by the managers.

PUNCH's LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER xvii.—on PoliticAL FLATTERY.—THE SKULL GOBLET.
ONE Gemelli Carreri, a travelled Italian, has preserved the following
story. Ponder on it, my son; for, duly considered, 't will be found to
enshrine the noblest worldly wisdom –
You have doubtless heard of Shah-Abas, called the Great if not,
it is no matter. A good story is just as good, and what may seem
strange to your unripe reflection, is just as true, whether the hero of it
ever lived or not To the philosophic mind, Tom Thumb is as real a
thing as Alexander. The wise man is as well taught by a shadow,
as by Caesar at the head of his legions.—However, to get back to
Shah-Abas: He was a great man, for he killed a certain king of the
Usbecks; and having killed him, did not ingloriously thrust all his
carcase into a hole, but preserved the royal skull from worms and
darkness, and made it the companion of his carousals and his merry
nights. Briefly, the great Shah-Abas had the king's skull set in gold,
for a drinking cup. Well had it been for the world, had all kingly
skulls been ever as socially employed The Shah died ; and for what
we know, had a merry laugh in the shades with the king of the
Usbecks, when he met and told him of the late hours his skull still
kept on the earth, of the wine that sparkled in it, of the free talk that
passed about it, of the jokes that were cracked, of the songs that were
chirruped The Shah's descendant much treasured the skull; and
feeling death to be the great teacher, never slept, without taking
copious advice from the king of the Usbecks. It happened that the
Usbeck people sent an ambassador to the Shah's descendant, to permit
and ratify a treaty of commerce. In those days, commercial principles
were in the bud; and therefore, the prejudice of the Usbecks is not
to be considered in the strong light of present wisdom. The Usbecks
prayed that they might be permitted to export their fleas free of duty
into the realm of the Shah ; offering as an equivalent, to admit the
Shah's blue-bottle flies on the same enlightened footing. The question,
as you may conceive, was of great national importance: many of the
oldest Usbecks declaring they were a lost folk from the moment they
admitted blue-bottles duty free: whilst some of the Shah's people
maintained the exclusive privilege of their fleas, as though they were
creatures of their own flesh ; and loudly clamoured for stringent
restrictions, for the sharpest scrutiny. . Every Usbeck should be
searched to the skin, to prevent the smuggling of fleas: whilst the
Usbecks, firing at this, threatened to throw up a line of observatories
on the frontiers to prevent the entry of a single blue-bottle into their
kingdom. The Shah's people were not behindhand : for albeit they
had all along admitted the Usbecks' sheep, they prayed the Shah that
he would henceforth have every beast shaved bare as his hand, fleas
having been known—it had been proved upon committee—to be
conveyed into the kingdom by means of the wool. The people also
called for an army of inspection on the annual flight of the swallows
from the Usbecks to the country of the Shah : they, too, had brought
fleas into the country, to the manifest injury of the home-breeder.
Matters were at the height, when the Shah gave a handsome
banquet to the ambassador of the Usbecks. In the midst of the jollity,
the Shah called, in the irony of his heart, for the loving-cup. The
cup-bearer approached, and on bended knee presented the skull of
the Usbeck king; the ambassador started at the indignity; and felt
a nervous contraction of his fingers that suddenly seemed to hunger
for the handle of his scimetar. Another second, and he had certainly
made a cut at the throat of the Shah, when his eye falling on the
goblet-skull of his late revered monarch, he thought he saw the bony
cavity, wherein was wont to roll and flash the burning eye of fiery
despotism, quickly and most significantly contract as with a wink,
and the jaw-bone slightly move, as much as to look and say—“Don’t
make a noodle of yourself.” Happily, too, at the same moment, the
Usbeck ambassador felt the fleas of his native country close at his
bosom. The ambassador smiled. -
“What think you of the goblet?” asked the Shah, with a very
ungentlemanly leer.
“I think,” said the ambassador, “my monarch was most happy,
most honoured, in falling by the hands of a great king ; but he is
still happier, still more honoured, in having his skull preserved by a
greater.’
The king was done: from that moment the Usbeck fleas hopped
without any fiscal restriction into the Shah's dominions, and the blue-
bottles of the Shah, without let or hindrance on the part of custom-
house mercenaries, sang their household music in the parlours of the
Usbecks, and in their hospitable larders made provisions for their
oviparous little ones.
I trust, my son, you can apply the moral of this veracious story, if
the ambassador had given vent to his rising ignorance—if on the
introduction of the royal skull, he had delivered himself of some red-
hot sentence or two-why, the anti-flea-law bigots had triumphed.
Until this day, perhaps, fleas had been smuggled into the lands of the
Shah; and blue-bottles, save as pets for the rich, been unknown in
the land of the Usbecks. But the ambassador rightly taking the wink
from the royal skull, the lowest subject of the Shah has the luxury
of fleas; whilst fly-blow mutton—allowing he can get mutton at all-
is within the reach of the meanest Usbeck.
Here, my son, you percelve the beauty, the utility of political
flattery : If Fortune, determining to show a great example to men,
resolve to make you a cabinet minister, engrave this story on your
heart. Never do any political act by direct straightforward means.
Always go round about your purpose. And for this reason, straight-
forward honesty is the last resource of a fool—mere honesty is the
white chicken's feather in the cap of the simpleton.
You were six years old when I took you to see my friend Mr. Polito's
elephant, and gave you a halfpenny. With a nascent generosity,
which nearly brought tears to my paternal eyes, you flung down the
copper coin at the feet of the majestic animal. Remember you not
your first wonder, when the elephant took the halfpenny up what
a curve he gave his trunk 1 how many bendings and turnings, he
employed ere he placed the halfpenny cake, purchased with Christian-
like sagacity of the tradesman near his den, in his capacious mouth
The same action employed by that elephant to pick up a halfpenny,
would be applied to the tearing up by the roots of the forest plane.
My son, the elephant is a practical politician : remember him, and
if you get exalted, do nothing great or small unless you do it with a
twist.
As the remainder of the sheet is not sufficient for us to discuss a
new subject, let me fill up the blank that remains with a few thoughts
on the drinking goblet of the Shah. In the memory of kings you
must acknowledge, from what I have narrated, that the influence of
kings passes not from the earth with their death. Though they are
nothing, for good or ill, their skulls—so to speak—remain. , What a
great lesson does Napoleon offer to those Frenchmen who every
morning wash themselves Understand me—
The French are, above all nations of the earth, a people of practical
wisdom—of practical morality. They make the glory of their great
men a household thing.
Napoleon is on his death-bed, his eagles flee upon their golden
wings to darkness—the trumpet wails in his ear—the last flutter of
his heart rises with the muttering drum—and “téte d'armée,” is his
death-sob. Napoleon is dead. A few minutes—the plaster is
poured above the face of imperial clay, and posterity is insured the
rera effigies of that thunderbolt of a man, just as the bolt was spent
Now that face, in its dreadful calmness, is multiplied in silver—in
bronze—in marble ! in richest metal and in purest stone. And now,
to teach a daily lesson to the common mind, that awful countenance,
with the weight of death upon it, is sold modelled in—soap !
Nay, have we not moral reflections brought to the very fingers'
ends of the people . As the mechanic cleanses his palms, and feels
his emperor's nose wasting away in his fingers, he thinks of Marengo
No. 71.

and Austerlitz With imperial face the pickpocket makes his
hands clean from last night's work, thinking the while of the rifled
halls and galleries of Italy: the butcher, new from his morning's
killing, washes his hands with the countenance of the emperor, the

And the philosopher peeps into the tub and sees the type and memory

A FSJRTHER ESSAY ON THE THEORY AND PRACTICE
OF ADVERTISEMENTS AND ADVERTISERS,
WITH SOME MORE cre ITICAL REMARKS THEREON.
BY JACOB DRY AS DUST, F.S.A.
PERMIt me to state that the individual who so unwarrantably
finished the last Essay is no friend of mine, but an enemy stained
with the blackest treachery and ingratitude; and I now give him
notice that, unless he immediately repays the 12s. borrowed of me
and returns the green-cotton umbrella which he carried off when he
last took tea here, I will see whether there is any justice to be had
in Kingsgate-street—whether the strong arm of the law cannot arrest
such a miscreant in his nefarious career, and teach him, in a voice of
thunder, that his conduct has been contrary to every clause in Magna
Charta, the Habeas Corpus, and Waste Lands Improvement acts.
DRoPPING, His AcquaintANCE.
A class of advertisements to which I would particularly direct
attention is that for wives; and here the intelligent reader will not
omit to notice a curious fact, namely, that all the gentlemen seeking
partners in this way are “good looking,” “young,” “of amiable
dispositions,” and “in easy circumstances.” I regret to say, I found
no difficulty whatever in getting married ; although justice towards
myself compels me to own that I possessed all those qualificstions—
my wife seldom reads, and therefore I may venture on this statement.
With a view to suit the tastes of these solitary individuals, Mr.
Green advertises “the Nobility, Gentry, and Public in general,” that
he has established a “Matrimonial Office” in Frith-street, Soho;
conducted, I am happy to say, “on principles of the strictest honour
and secrecy, and Mrs. Green waits on Ladies.” When Mrs. Dryas-
dust was very ill a short time ago, I called at the “office” promis-
cuously, and was shown a series of photographic portraits, with the
owners' fortune inscribed below. However, I regretted to find that
the only likeness which could have tempted me belonged to a widow,
with twenty-eight pounds a year and six children; and even she
might have had red hair.
To enable the gentlemen to look handsome and the ladies amiable,
Mr. Howard advertises to furnish “teeth without springs, wires, or
other ligatures;” to replace those lost; and “mineral succedaneum”
to stop those which the sufferer would be glad to find gone. Mr. Fox
has “Vegetable Cream” to produce hair, whiskers and eyebrows ; and
I can vouch for the efficacy of it, although it has caused a growth of
decidedly carrotty appearance. This, however, proves the correct-
ness of its name.
I need only mention “The Washable Patent Fronts,” “Unpa-
ralleled Curling Fluid”—a mixture which looks and smells amazingly
like ox-tail soup, —“Paris Fixature,” “Tyrian Hair Dye,” “Olden's
Eukeirogenion,” “Rowland's Odonto,” “Pearl Powder,” and “Sici-
lian Bloom,” to prove that ugliness will soon be eradicated.
I am sometimes extremely puzzled to define the exact difference
between the “original,” “the old original,” and “the real old original;”
or to guess why “Earls, Lords, and Bishops’’ should all “rush to
Lombard-street to buy the 11s. Doudney.” Nor can I clearly under-
stand why “Mrs. Johnson's American Soothing Syrup is a blessing
to the human race”—perhaps she will have the goodness to prove it
in a plain and practical way by sending me a bottle. “Fanny Kemble
and Pandora Tulips” must be as delightful as “Stirling's Stomach
Pills” are detestable, although “they are now strongly recom-
mended in consequence of the new Tariff, which will cause a great
consumption of American pork, hams and beef:” what a pleasing
anticipation 1
There is something very edifying in the study of Literary Adver-
tisements. “Softness” by the author of “Hardness” is, I presume,
to find its parallel in “Fatness" by the author of “Leanness;” the
mind is pleasantly occupied in guessing whether “Kidd's Art of
Pleasing and being Pleased” is different from that of other people—or
in wondering what can be the “One Fault” which Mrs. Trollope has
committed to the press. “The Diary of a Physician” has given
birth to “The Memoirs of a Monthly Nurse,” “Reminiscences of a
Medical Student,” and “Diary of an Upper Housemaid, where a
Footman is kept.” The TIMEs occasionally says—“we are credibly
informed the brilliant authoress of the Disgusted One has another
novel in hand;” whilst Mr. Colburn avers, on his veracity, that “the
forthcoming work entitled “The Comical-struck Cook; or Love and
Trigonometry,” is not the production of Sir E. L. Bulwer, but of a
lady distinguished in high life for her literary attainments and
acuteness of observation. I do not very clearly see how the public can
have mistaken the author of a book which it is plain they never
heard of.
Advertisements of eatables are delightful reading before dinner.
“Baillie's Bilious Breakfast Bacon” alliterates itself into our favour.
“Parfait Amour” means, I am surprised to find, something good to
drink. “Smith's Aniseed Cordial” enables respectable ladies to get
tipsy secundum artem; and “Cream of the Valley” and “Milk of
Canaan” are but refined methods of talking about gin and bitters.
An advertisement of “Parkinson's Aperient Gingerbread” has made
me studiously avoid that delicious article of food, for fear of getting
hold of the wrong sort by mistake. “A fresh arrival of Maraschino
de Drioli at Morel and Co.'s,” does not mean, as some country people
imagine, that a new Italian singer or dancer has landed at that abode
of mysterious and incomprehensible-looking pies, but announces a
liqueur which is particularly nice when you can drink it at another's
expense.
The Kentish Herald lately contained the following notice : “Rane-
lagh Gardens, Margate—last night of Mount Vesuvius, in con-
sequence of an engagement with the Patagonians.” This is tragical
enough; but the Times outdoes it in horror, by informing us that
“The Nunhead Cemetery is now open for general interment;” and
immediately afterwards comes an advertisement of “The London
General Mourning Warehouse, Oxford-street;” and then, to crown
all, Mr. Simpson, of Long Acre, declares himself ready to make
“Distresses in Town and Country, so as to give general satisfaction.”

sert WING A FRIEND.
Almost every horse advertised is of “grand action,” “well-bred,”
“rides very superior,” “without vice,” “a clever fencer;” and it is
curious to find that the vendor always parts with his stud “because
he is going abroad.” “The Proprietor of the Repository, Bury-place,
Bloomsbury-square, retiring from the Canine World, offers to the Public
Dogs of superior fashion and character”—and “will sell a Brougham a
decided bargain, or change it for a Stanhope.”
I should like to draw a moral from these facts, which is, I believe,
the usual and proper course; but my pen is getting extremely bad,
and my wife has already twice told me to go to bed, as it is washing-
night. If any observations of mine have served, as a handkerchief,
to wipe away one tear from the eyes of care—as a “Daffy's Elixir,”
to soothe one pang of a man with the tooth-ache—or as a stick to
stir up one generous emotion—I have not been without my reward.

LO R D M A Y O R'S DAY.
(From Punch's own Reporter.)
THE preparations at Guildhall were upon a very extended scale, in
crder to give effect to the solemnities which mark the accession of
one civic monarch and the abdication of another. The outgoing
Sovereign, Pirie, is perhaps one of the most brick-like princes that
ever sat upon the civic throne; and the present reigning family of
Humphrey is descended from the old Dukes of that name, whose
hospitality was such, that it was familiarly said of the first Duke
Humphrey, any one who pleased might dine with him.
At an early hour a cart full of luggage arrived at the Mansion-
house, consisting of the wardrobe, the shaving tackle, and other per-
sonal property of the new Lord Mayor; while at nearly the same time a
truck with two or three portmanteaus, and a bundle, from which we
saw the end of a boot-jack protruding—all of them being articles in
use by the outgoing Lord Mayor, up to the last moment of his
Mayoralty—left the door of the side entrance.
All was bustle in the Mansion-house. The civic shaving water
had been ordered at six o'clock, and the state shoes were to be drawn
up on the outside of the bed-room door for the last time—after which
they would of course give place to the common Clarences of every-day
life, or the high-lows of ordinary humanity.
By a little after seven the outgoing Lord Mayor had stropped his
razor in the character of city sovereign for the last time, and as the
clock struck a quarter to eight, the chamber towel was finally
wrapped round those little extras, which, being wanted up to the last
moment of leaving a house, are omitted in the general package.
At ten o'clock the outgoing Mayor entered the Council Chamber,
where breakfast had been laid out for his friends, who received him
with loud applause; but there was an evident awkwardness among
most of them as to whether they ought to congratulate him or condole
with him, on the termination of his dignity. The breakfast consisted
of tea, at one end, and coffee at the other, while a pot of the soluble
chocolate—warranted to require no boiling—occupied the centre.
Several graceful chickens studded the festive board, and we observed
an additional flavour being given to some of them by the process of
cutting with a hammy knife, an experiment that was resorted to
by many of the company.
The outgoing Lord Mayor made several very creditable attempts
to look as if he did not care, though he signally failed in a futile
affectation of jollity, which was evident he assumed with the greatest
difficulty. At eleven o'clock a thundering rap was heard at the door
of the Mansion-house, and there was such an insolent air of I’m-at-
home-at-ireness in the sound, that everybody felt it could only be the
successor to the civic throne, for whom such a regular cessarara had
been given. The outgoing and the incoming were now face to face.
Pirie turned deadly pale, and Humphrey, with well dissembled
humility, bowed to the assembled guests. Never since Gloucester
gammoned the citizens, as shown by Shakspere in Richard the Third,
were the citizens so thoroughly humbugged as they were when
Humphrey pretended not to feel that he had risen above that condi-
tion which is generally likened to a diminutive order of malt liquor.
The late Lord Mayor—whose opinion is entitled to some weight in
these matters, for he is a tallow melter—declared he had never
known such melting moments as those at which his dignity was
snuffed out for ever. When Humphrey the First entered the room,
Pirie the Nothingth—for such he must now be called—felt that his
light must in future be hid under a bushel, or any other measure that
his warehouse might be furnished with.
It was now time to take water, and as neither of the Lord Mayors
are what is technically called “ sailors,” considerable anxiety had
been manifested about the wind, which was observed to be playing
“Mag’s Diversion,” with a fiery griffin on the top of the cowl of an
adjacent chimney. The attitude of the griffin—indicating as it did
the boisterousness of the day, was truly alarming. Now it wheeled
round towards the north, and seemed to be on the point of flying
over towards Finsbury Square, when with a sudden jerk its face
was turned round upon the affrighted citizens themselves, as much
as to say, “if you are looking out for squalls, you'll have enough
of them.”
The feeling of trepidation becoming painful in the extreme, it was at
last resolved that his civic Majesty and suite should go by land over
London bridge, in order to ascertain whether the water was really
too rough to venture on. The procession then started, much in the
usual way, except that the Skinner's Company came in their skins,
and the cordwainers had a long string of dirty little boys after them.
The fishmongers wore clean gills, and one of them carried in his
pocket a very fine specimen of the native whelk, that had been taken
that morning by the crew of a coal-barge off Billingsgate.
Having arrived at the Southwark side of the river, a long discus-
sion ensued, and it was at last resolved “to venture.” A mariner in
a wherry had been previously sent out to reconnoitre, and having
come back with the intelligence that the water was too low to render
it possible for any one to be drowned, the order was given to reef
the brown holland from the gilt rudder of the state barge, which was
done in true seamanlike style, by one of the civic watermen. The little
fleet at length got under weigh, and the City Chamberlain having
secured the cap of maintenance to the button-hole of utility by the
THE CAP or Maintainance.
garter of black lutestring, was able to preserve his place on the
| deck—without losing his hat—during the whole of the voyage.
It is some years since the civic fleet has been in a regular storm; but
on this occasion, the elements had certainly been having hole-and-
corner meetings somewhere, to organise a conspiracy for the purpose
of worrying the city authorities. The Lord Mayor himself behaved
like a hero. He walked up and down the deck during the whole pas-
sage, encouraging his suite by his own example ; but when the state
barge foundered on the frightful rock off Whitehall, even the Lord
Mayor's firmness forsook him, and he fell back as if struck by a cannon-
ball, on to the cushion immediately under him. The confusion at this
moment on board the state barge, was of the most horrible descrip-
tion. Several would have jumped into the water, and walked a dis-
tance of several yards through the heavy mud to the prairie before
the house of Sir R. Peel. Others were for hailing the colliers, who
stood laughing on the neighbouring barges; but, as it was suggested
by some one (who in that trying moment undertook the office of Lord
Mayor's Fool) that “time and tide waited” for no man, it was agreed
to wait for the tide instead; and the shipwrecked crew accordingly
sat down on deck, determined to make the best of it. In the hope of
getting towed off, signals of distress were hoisted by several of the
citizens; some of whom attached their pocket-handkerchiefs to the
ends of their walking-sticks. But, we regret to say, such is the feeling
of disloyalty among the Thames watermen, that none put off to rescue
the civic monarch from a watery—or rather a gassy sewery and
muddy—grave in the bed of the river. The wreck of the civic barge
seemed almost inevitable, and Byron's beautiful description was
realised on the deck of the vessel—
“Then rose from Thames to sky the wild farewell—
Then shriek'd the timid and stood still the brave.
Some would leap overboard with dreadful yell,
As eager to anticipate their grave.”
Such indeed was the awful scene. The “wild farewell” was exem-
plified in loud exclamations of “Good bye to the dinner 1" and the
“shriek of the timid" was illustrated by a heart-rending yell from a
common councilman; the “standing still of the brave” was illus-
trated in the fixed attitude of despair assumed by the coxswain, a
weather-beaten and Thames-splashed tar; and the “leaping over-
board with dreadful yell,” though it did not actually take place, there
was every moment strong reason to anticipate.
The noble vessel, at length, gave signs of life; the tide rose, and
the craft waking, like an elephant refreshed, waddled on towards
Westminster. The procession having landed, immediately made for the
Courts of Law and entered the Court of Exchequer just as a promising
junior—whose name will be readily guessed—was meeting a crowded
audience, rapt in attention during one of those eloquent appli-
cations for a rule to compute, which he has on several previous
occasions addressed successfully to the judgment seat. He had
mentioned the name of the case, and proceeded to state that “his
application was founded on the usual”—“affidarit” he would
have said, when the red baize curtain at the back of the court was
drawn aside, and the civic party poked their heads from under it.
The Lord Mayor having gone through the solemn ceremony of “taking
the oath,” in which he declared his conviction that “excommunicated
persons may not be slain in the streets,” and gave utterance to other
truisms, his adhesion to which is thought necessary to fit him for his
office—the recorder asked the judges to dinner—the venerable barons
of the exchequer unconsciously licking their mouths, at the mention

of the word banquet—accepted the invitation, and the procession
beginning to feel awkward, at having nothing else to do, prepared to
depart, amid smiles, bows, and twinkles of the eye from the bench—
knowing looks from the bar—and tittering from the audience. There
was some awkwardness on account of the Recorder having endea-
voured to make his erit through a strongly sewn seam in the middle
of the curtain, instead of the opening at the side, and while that
learned individual was making a fruitless effort to penetrate the
baize itself, the Mayor and the rest of the party discovered the real
yoint for erit, leaving the recorder kicking and plunging in the centre
of the obstinate drapery.
The º: length got once more afloat, and the perils
of the deep were again to be encountered. The squadron became
so unmanageable, that a revenue cutter was unfortunately run
down by it, and five men were immersed in the muddy fluid,
but were happily picked up, and plied with brandy by the 'hos-
pitable citizens. Having at length escaped all the “moving acci-
dents by flood,” including another accident of not moving or
running aground, the squadron hove to in gallant style at the foot of
Blackfriars-bridge, and the procession was met by the Lady Mayoress,
who had been watching the Fleet—not in Farringdon-street—but—
in the offing, with the most agonizing interest. Her ladyship's feel-
ings, on finding the Lord Mayor once more safe on terra firma, can be
better conceived than described, and we therefore earnestly call
upon the whole world to fancy themselves Lady Mayoresses under
oircumstances similar to those we have alluded to.

This part of the ceremony of Lord Mayor's day was on a scale of
unexampled grandeur. There was every delicacy of the season,
including sprats, which come in on this day; and though they are
ultimately to be had for a halfpenny a hatful in the New Cut, are,
at this particular period, regarded as an expensive luxury.
| The speeches were of the usual description. The leaders of each
party in politics, who, as a matter of business, call each other scoun-
drels all through the parliamentary session, were full of protestations
of mutual friendship. Lord Stanley declared Lord John Russell to
be a very worthy fellow ; and Lord John Russell, whose chief occu-
pation in the House of Commons is to prove Lord Stanley a renegade
and a rogue, declared, over the Lord Mayor's champagne, that he had
a very sincere private esteem for the very man whom he is always
publicly stigmatising as the most dishonest and despicable of charac-

|Lord Mayor making a complimentary speech about the old, and the
old puffing the new ; while each thought himself what is commonly
called an infinitely superior card to the other.
We should be sorry to trace the old Lord Mayor to the privacy of
retirement ; but our readers can imagine the feelings with which he
|hung his hat upon the ordinary peg of an every-day household, and
walked up the small well-staircase of his private abode, after having
been accustomed to a whole year's fling at the Mansion House.
There was no gold stick, or silver stick, now to see him to the
threshold of the bed-chamber, but there was brass candlestick in
back or front as the case may be—which he uses at home for a sleep-

night-cap of private life, and we will bid him good night, as with the
japanned extinguisher he “puts out the light,” which will never be
reillumined upon his departed dignity. Far different is the scene at
the Mansion House. There the new Lord Mayor, after the departure
of his guests, capers nimbly before a looking-glass; while the Lady
Mayoress, and the Honourable Miss Mayors congratulate each other
upon how they did it at the festival.

As to bed in their splendid new quarters,
Laughing and giggling they run.
THE MEDICAL STUDENT.
(New Series.)
ChapTER 111.-of the LoDGINGS INHABITED BY MR. SIMPSON BRIGGs.
WHEN Mr. Simpson Briggs first came to town, he took up his
abode in a mansion, whose various rooms were dedicated solely to
the purpose of lodging medical students; and of course a very quiet,
well conducted, and respectable house it was. Here then he pitched
his tent, or more properly, pitched his things down, for he was not
over tidy in the arrangement of his wardrobe in the drawers, gene-
rally choosing to keep his clean shirts in the closet with the candles
and bottled porter, and his clothes in his trunk in company with odd
bones, short pipes, and scrap leaves of various “Anatomist's Guides,”
and “Student's Companions.”
The rooms on the separate floors were all alike, except in the
rents; and by describing one, a just idea may be formed of all.
The landlady and the furniture had both seen better days, as
landladies and furniture generally have. The bed-curtains were
of dark glazed calico to keep clean a long time, and not show
the dirt when they ceased to be so; the dingy walls were redolent of
tobacco; and there was, in the sitting room, a dark old fashioned
half-round mahogany table, whereon was to be seen a Quain's Anatomy,
a scapula, a broken scalpel, a sixpenny song-book, and sundry circles
of evaporated moisture, somewhat about the circumference of the
bottom of a quart pot. The pattern of the carpet had long been obli-
terated, and its colours had now settled into a very neutral tint,
variegated with mud. The looking glass had been scored all to pieces
with diamond rings whenever any of the tenants had been fortunate
enough to possess such articles; a few pictures of that elaborate and
entertaining kind, only met with in lodging-houses and brokers' shops,
adorned the walls, and you have a very fair idea of the apartments
which Mr. Simpson Briggs rented at fourteen shillings per week.
Although the house was situated in a very quiet street, yet various
internal noises were perpetually occurring to prevent a monotonous
tranquillity, depressing the minds of the inmates. The servant was
usually called up by a summons over the stairs, from the various
floors, as all the bell-pulls had disappeared in times of the most remote
antiquity; and occasionally a noisy clattering down stairs agreeably
broke the silence, as a student slid down the last flight, a species of
descent much in vogue with the tenants, by which the top rail of the
banisters had been worn as smooth as polished mahogany, and the
mat at the bottom of the stairs lacerated in several places, by receiv-
ing the first shock of their hoels when they landed in the passage.
The spot of earth on which this interesting tenement stood, was in
that wide locality commonly known as “over the water,”—a territory
principally appropriated to medical students and actors, the latter of
whom may be seen in crowds upon Waterloo Bridge about six
o'clock in the evening, on their way from their mysterious abodes to
the theatres ; and who may also be met again, if you choose to wait
for them, about midnight, retracing their steps homeward. The
nearest clue we can give to Mr. Brigg's first abode is, that you went
over Waterloo Bridge to get to it; which circumstance afforded
great amusement to those gentlemen who honoured him with their
acquaintance when they came to call upon him. The tolls were not
then reduced, and they usually stopped a few seconds to hold a little
converse with the pikeman, offering to toss him whether they should
pay twopence or nothing a piece to go over. This was always refused
very surlily; and then they would ask him which was the lowest he
could take for permission to drown themselves from off the bridge,
and if it was more expensive to try hanging, by way of variety. And
sometimes when Mr. Simpson Briggs had been supping at Evans',
and was going home very jolly, he would enquire of the pikeman if
he had seen a gentleman go over that evening, in a black coat and

short Wellingtons, with a cotton handkerchief in his hat, because if
he had, he wished his compliments to be given to him when he came
back again. And, if he had friends with him, they would make a
few remarks upon the flourishing state of the bridge-funds, and the
immense fortunes the shareholders were reaping from them ; and
the last who went through the turnstile generally spun it round as
he passed, with a force that sent it turning and clicking for the next
two minutes, to the great anger of the toll-keeper, whom the constant
revolving of the gate before his eyes had rendered very bilious and
irritable.
Well, Mr. Simpson Briggs, located at this lodging for four or five
winters, going home every summer for the purpose, as he assured his
friends, of a little country tranquillity to recruit his health, and ena-
ble him to work very hard against the ensuing course, at the end of
which he thought about going up for his examination at Apothecaries'
Hall. At length, as we have before stated, he entered to the school
which Muff and his companions patronized; and as the present
lodging was too far, and his landlady appeared going to die, or fail,
or something of the kind, he packed up his goods, which were com-
prised in a carpet-bag and a fishing-basket, and emigrated to another
quarter of the town; having first written to Jack Randall, to beg he
would see if there were any cheap apartments in the neighbourhood
likely to suit him. -
“I think I have got a crib that will do for you,” said Jack, when
his acquaintance came to the school one morning, “there's only one
thing against it.”
“Well, what's that " - -
Only the landlady's a very pious old woman,--all religion and
rheumatism—she don't like much noise, and says she won't take any
medical students to live in her house, because they are such rackety

*well, I don't think so,” replied Simpson. “How people's opinions
do differ But I say, Jack t”
“Now then, throw it off.”
“She need not know I'm a medical student.”
“That's what I was going to recommend. Say you are a clerk in
the Bank—the clerks in the Bank are always very estimable young
men.”
“Well, that might do,” replied Mr. Briggs, after a moment's reflec-
tion. “But I say, Jack—suppose she sees any bones lying about.
Clerks in the Bank don’t study osteology.”
“But you musn't let her see any,” returned Randall. “Learn
your anatomy from pictures—that's what I always do. The rooms
are cheap enough ; ten shillings a-week for the whole suite.”
“And what does it consist of "
“A parlour and a turn-up bedstead, with a recess to hang your
clothes up in. It is on the first floor, too.”
“Now, if I hire it,” said Mr. Briggs; “don’t you be a fool and let
out that I am a medical student.”
“You may trust me,” replied Randall. “You certainly don't look
much like one with that old-fashioned mug of yours. I should take
you for forty.” -
“And you must not come kicking up shindies there the first week
or two,” continued Simpson.
town for a few weeks. You will see nothing of me until you are
firmly settled in the old lady's good graces.”
In a few days, Mr. Simpson Briggs having assured the mistress of
the house that he was an extremely well-conducted young man, of
regular habits, and respectable connections, was comfortably installed
in his new lodgings; and fearful his father should begin to think it
was time he went up for his examination, he wrote him a long
letter, telling him how very hard he was working, and what a flattering
finale he expected to his approaching examination. All this his father

was very glad to hear, for Simpson was now approaching his sixth
anatomical session; and, moreover, as he had entered the profession
rather late in life, it may very readily be imagined that he had not
too much time to spare.
He was much astonished, the first night he entered his new house,
to see a large chest in the middle of the room, apparently put there
for the purpose of being in everybody's way; but he was a great deal
more surprised, on lifting up the lid to see what it contained, to dis-
cover that it had no bottom, but that he could see right down into the
room below. He immediately rang the bell, to inquire the cause and
intent of so strange a piece of furniture, and equally singular com-
munication between the first and ground floors. The old lady who
kept the house, and who could talk anybody deaf, began a long story
in reply, of the state of her affairs upon her husband's death, and
finally came to the point, by affirming, that when she first took the
house it had been a cook-shop, and the chest was a species of con-
trivance through which the plates of meat and vegetables were sent
up from the shop below to the dining-room, which part of the
establishment Mr. Simpson Briggs' room once formed. She added
that he had nothing to fear, as there was a very nice gentleman
below, who belonged to some house in the city; and he could always
lock the chest if he chose, and thus shut off all communication.

Mr. Briggs professed himself perfectly satisfied with this explan-

his new domicile.
THE SEPARATION.

I drew'd the tie that link'd us twain
Was strong, and form'd to last for cver;
But, ah Delusion, fond and vain!
I feel that tie must shortly sever.
"Mid Fashion's throng, in festive hall,
Or wheresoe'er my steps inclin'd,
At morning walk or midnight ball,
Close didst thou ever hang behind.
How oft hast thou embrac'd my zone,
When none the tight cmbrace could see;
They vainly deem'd that we were one,—
And wilt thou now fall off from me?
I feel that we must part—but oh 1
Unwitness'd let that parting be;
Where none can see—where none can know,
That thou hast ceased to cling to me.
Then go–I can my tears restrain,
Nor shake a nerve, nor move a muscle;
But ah, I feel I plead in vain,
And thou art gone–my treach'rous Bussel.
LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
Bauers were buoyant in the early part of the week, and several pleas
were done—which was the case with the barristers, who having signed
without the fee, could not get it afterwards. Parchment scrip was
freely offered, but in many cases refused : we, however, saw one instance
of its being taken, though the party seemed reluctant to continue a holder,
and threw it back upon the individual with whom the transaction had
been managed.

REVIEW OF THE PAST RACING SEASON.—BY “OUR OWN
PROPHET.”
As the legitimate sports of the turf closed with the last Newmarket
Meeting, it becomes our duty to review the events of the Races, in their
respective order, throughout the season. Commencing with the Epsom
Spring—as the weather was very unpropitious, the jockeys came off with
flying colours, but the bill of fare proved very deceptive. At Newmarket,
the racing was very flat, and threw no light upon the Derby—to which
we now proceed, as the most important race on our list. The result of
this grand stake thoroughly confirmed our prediction—we forewarned our
readers that, in all probability, Attila would not be last ; and how was
this verified when the gallant hero was proclaimed the victor, amidst the
shouts and gratulations of the assembled thousands ! We always thought
Robert de Gorham likely to run forward—as we had never seen him run
in any other direction. For the Oaks, Our Nell told wonderfully when,
to the surprise of the Legs, she came in first by several feet : our prog-
nostications regarding this event turned out successful—as we stated that
it was anybody's race.—Ascot is the next meeting of importance. The
Queen met with a warm reception—the company was high, and the
weather dry. The Cup, as we expected, fell to Beeswing's lot ; and the
daughter of Dr. Syntax passing the post first, scanned the line of her
opponents behind her. The Houses of Parliament were adjourned in
consequence of the attraction of the sport, which proves that the Turf
has lost none of its former splendour—the honourable members preferring
to listen to the Peel of the starting-bell, and the Rustle of the silk jacket.
At the conclusion of the day's amusement the company retired to dinner,
where, for the first time in the course of the meeting, the carte was before
the horse.—We must now hasten on to Goodwood. Here we saw many
Richmonds in the field, in addition to the splendid assemblage of noblemen
and legs. In the Drawing-room, Attila was (h)undone, and fulfilled our
prediction that the extra weight would prove too great a drawback: he
was heavily backed by his party, whom he thus disappointed.—Doncaster
next claims our attention. The first event to be decided was the Cham-
pagne, which we were not surprised to find was carried off by a British
yeoman. The lot was well up, yet some of the nags were rather groggy
at the finish. The result of the St. Leger we had fully anticipated : our
readers will remember that we said, “if the favourites falter, an outsider
will in all probability be the winner: whether this prove the case or not,
time alone will show.” It did prove the case ; and Blue Bonnet, with
Thou coxiest, AND IN such A Questionablf shape.
a little shaking, won cleverly. Some stated that if she had been in better
trim, she would have won with greater ease—with as much facility, in
fact, had she carried a feather. Leaving this point for the knowing ones
to settle, we proceed at once to the Autumnal meetings at Newmarket,
where both the quantity and quality of the sport were excellent; and the
matches went off without a failure. Although we were not so fortunate
as to select the winner of the Cambridgeshire Stakes, yet we were not
far out in our calculations. The Stakes were snatched out of the fire by
a terrific rush at the last, or our prediction would have been verified:
the jockey—not the horse—won the race.
Our task is now accomplished : it has been a pleasing one, because in
its progress we have traced our superiority over all the other prophets of
the Turf–whose predictions have been for the most part unsuccessful.
We earnestly hope that, at the approach of Spring, we shall again behold
the same familiar faces assembled to participate in this truly national
amusement; and that they, and all, will again be gladdened by the merry
rustle of the silk jacket.

PUNCH'S COMIC MYTHOLOGY.
CHAP. W.--THE EARLY HISTORY OF MERCURY.
“Will you have a little gruel, ma'am!'” said the monthly nurse.
“Not at present, thank you,” answered Maia, gazing lovingly upon the
infant Mercury, who was slumbering by her side.
“Aint he a duck, ma'am!'” said the nurse, who was, as monthly nurses
ever were, and ever will be—a flatterer.
“He’s a divinity 1" exclaimed the delighted Maia; and the boy, as
though to thank her for her compliment, opened his eyes—blue as the sky
of his own Arcadia—and, winking knowingly at his mother, sang—
In the Mount Cyllene I was born,
Of a mountain nymph but yester-morn,
Fake away!
The noble father that I can boast,
On great Olympus rules the roast,
Nix my dolly pals fake away :
Nix my dolly pals fake away !
“Bless me, what precociousness,” exclaimed Maia.
“It’s the cholic, ma'am, rely on it,” said the nurse, and instantly admi-
nistered a spoonful of “Mrs. Johnson's real Blessing to Mothers” to the
vocal baby.
At length Maia slept, and the monthly nurse, worn out with watching
and cordials, placed her feet upon the fender, gradually opened her mouth
and shut her eyes, and snored a bass to Maia's more tuneful treble.
Mercury, who had feigned to sleep, also now arose (though but a day
old), and tucking the tail of his long-clothes through his girdle, said to
himself,
“What shall I be up to now?”
As he spoke, a tortoise crawled to the mouth of the cave, and having
peered about to see how matters stood, was preparing to retreat again,
when Hermes, feeling that the duetto of his parent and nurse would be all
the better for an accompaniment, seized the animal and killed it. Having
taken out the flesh, he adapted reeds and strings to the shell, and formed
from it the phorminx (or, as it was afterwards called, in honour of its
inventor, the lyre). As soon as he had reduced the discord of the sleepers
to harmony, he hid the instrument in his cradle, and started off in search
of adventures.
Now there lived in Pieria one Phoebus Apollo, who not only possessed
a very extensive milk-walk of his own, but had also the care of the cows
of the gods. Why they could have required these lacteal animals is still
a matter of great conjecture, though the most learned upon these subjects
suppose that they were employed in the formation of the Milky Way.
Mercury arrived by sunset at Pieria; and having selected fifty of the
fattest cows from Apollo's dairy, he contrived, by some secret art of pro-
gression, to make them go backwards, and throwing away his own little
blue-and-white worsted socks, he bound sprigs of Inyrtle and tamarisk
under his feet, in order to baffle Apollo and the police of Arcadia, should
a warrant be granted for his apprehension.
As he passed Onchestus, he saw an old man fencing his vineyard; which
in some way annoyed him, for he had depended upon proving an alibi in the
event of the matter being sent to a jury. However, a baby that could
walk and talk at two days old was not likely to be baffled very easily, so
Hermes determined to put a bold face on the matter, and bamboozle the
old man, if possible.
“Fine morning, master l’” said Mercury.
“Ees, it be, zur,” replied the vine-dresser. “Them looks likely beasts
}. gotten there,” continued the old man, as he scratched the calf of
is leg with the point of his bill-hook.
“Yes, they are a choice lot,” answered Mercury; “I bought them at
the fair of Pieria.”
“Ay, I suppose so,” said the old man—“ of Phibbus Appollo, I'se
sure—I could swear to them Short-horns.”
“The dickens you can "thought Mercury; “then I’m dished if I can't
bribe you into silence.”
“Are you rich, my old friend ?” said the god of thieves.
“Rich —I’ze—lard help thee l’exclaimed the old man—“I’ze haven't
as much as would pay for an ounce of 'bacca.”
“Then, listen to me ! If you will forget that you have ever seen me or
these Short-horns before, I'll make you as rich as Plutus,” whispered
Mercury. -
“You wull !” exclaimed the old man—“I’d forget mysen for half as
much l’’
Hermes instantly produced his stylus and a sheet of papyrus, and drew
an order for a thousand ounces of gold upon the “ipou-crene,” which
was somewhat synonymous with a cheque upon our Aldgate pump.
The old vine-dresser was in ecstacy, and promised to be as dumb as an
oyster.
As the moon was rising, Mercury arrived with his booty on the banks
of the Alpheius, in the Peloponnesus, and feeling rather hungry, he made
a fire, and killed, cut up, and dressed two of the beasts—quite enough for a
light supper with the black puddings which he made of their blood.
In the morning one of the milk-maids told Apollo of his loss. The
* Hippocrene.
herdsman god flew into a violent passion, and kicked one of the cowboys
so severely, that it was found necessary to send him to the infirmary.
When Phoebus arrived at Pylos he saw traces of his cattle, and at that
moment fortunately met with the old vine-dresser, who, having presented
his draft was not in the best humour at finding how scurvily he had been
treated. The moment that he beheld Apollo, he determined to peach.
Encouraged by his information Apollo proceeded to the cave of the nymph,
guided thither by the fragrancy of the caudle with which Maia was re-
galing herself and nurse.
Mercury hid his head under the bed-clothes when the injured herdsman
entered the cavern. In vain did Maia protest that the cows were in none
of her drawers or band-boxes, for Apollo would not be satisfied until he
had searched the closets where the nymph kept her food, her dresses,
and her ornaments. At length he discovered Master. Mercury, and
dragging him from beneath the coverlid, threatened to kick him to Tar-
tarus unless he confessed where the cows were.
“Cows,” lisped Mercury—‘what are cows ' which seemed such a very
natural inquiry from an infant in arms, that Apollo was at first inclined to
believe himself mistaken. However, the roguish expression of the boy's
eye atlast determined him to take Mercury before the Olympian beaks.
“What have you to say to this charge, my little fellow " said Zeus,
who was the presiding magistrate for the time being.
“Nothing,” answered the boy, “but that I was only born the day be-
fore yesterday.”
“The case is dismissed,” said Zeus. “What is the next charget"
Apollo appeared so excessively mortified that Hermes relented, and
took him to the cave at Pylos, where he had concealed the cows. To pre-
vent them from straying, he had by his arts fixed their feet to the ground ;
and Apollo, plainly perceiving that Mercury was one too much for him,
offered to give him the cattle for his lyre of tortoiseshell. Hermes, hav-
ing an eye for a good bargain, instantly “struck hands and took the
offer.” Apollo generously presented him with his whip and a golden rod,
exacting from the celestial Jack Sheppard an oath that he would never
steal either his lyre or his bow. -
Mercury grew up to be a regular cracksman, and, like the modern
worthies of the road, had more than one bona roba. º: others,
was Miss Mary Miller, or Polymela, as Homer familiarly calls her, and a
lady that Hermes fondly designated his Shy One, or Chione.
STATISTICAL SOCIETY.
At the last meeting of this Society, a paper, by Dr. Reid, was read
which excited much interest. The Doctor had discovered that by filtering
the air through gauze, before it was admitted to the House of Commons,
he had, in a single night, stopped 200,000 “blacks” from entering the
house." Supposing the average number of members attending the House
to be 400, there would have been “500 blacks” to each white; but de-
ducting the number in the House who were black already, he considered
the fair average to be 600 “blacks" to each white. Now, reckoning
A lottaught at sight.
according to the usual calculation, that two blacks make a white, the
Doctor considered that such a large addition to the house would tend
greatly to vitiate the “purity of election," and would, had he not fortu-
nately discovered this mode of stopping the “blacks,” have ultimately
undermined the personal purity of members. Some very elaborate cal-
culations were given as to the physical force of these “blacks,” and the
probable effect their stoppage would produce on the “committee of sup-
ly.” Dr. Quack'em said he thought it right to state, that a high testi-
monial of the great merits of Dr. Reid had been given by that paragon of -
learning and wisdom, Sir Peter Laurie. The learned Knight had stated
that since the alteration by Dr. Reid in the Court-house of the Old Bailey,
“any person could now sit as comfortably in shoes as he could formerly
do in boots;” and that he had made some calculations (being well
acquainted with the value of leather) by which he had found, that by sub-
stituting shoes for boots during the sessions at the Old Bailey, there could
be effected a saving of 7l. 8s. 103d. per annum by the Lord Mayor,
Aldermen, and other members of the Court ; in consequence of these
alterations, he (Dr. Quack'em) considered this last discovery of the
learned Doctor about the “blacks” was even much more important than
the above saving, and was such as at once placed him in the very highest
ranks of science. The thanks of the meeting were unanimously voted to
the author for the communication.

A PRIZE JACKASS.
At the Darlington Agricultural dinner, the praises of a Durham cow
were set to music, and sung by the guests. We understand there was a
horn accompaniment, and that several glasses were tossed off in compli-

She's long in her face—she’s fine in her horn;
She'll quickly get fat, without oil-cake or corn;
Hurra ! hurra! for this beautiful cow.

He's thin in the face, and he's weak in the thigh;
Hurra! hurra! for this exquisite Jackass.
He's sharp in the look though he never gets grain,
He's empty in stomach and bad in the mane;
Hurra! hurra! for this exquisite Jackass.
He's straight in the hock—he's bent in the knees,
He's low in the neck, but loud in the sneeze;

He's slow in the saddle—he's worse in the cart,
No grooming, but only the whip makes him smart;

RECIPES.
How to MAKE AN Inish Story.—Lay your scene principally in
Galway, and let your chief characters be the officers of a regiment of
Dragoons. Represent them as habitual drunkards, as duellists, and as
practical jokers; but take care to exclude from their tricks every-
thing like wit. Introduce as frequently as possible, with the neces-
sary variation only of time, place, and circumstance, a tipsy brawl,
with a table oversetting in the midst of it, and a ragamuffin with a
great stick in his hand, capering thereon. Do not omit to mention
the bottles and glasses that whistle, during this performance, about
his ears, nor the chairs and fire-irons which are used by the sur-
rounding combatants; and under the table fail not to place your
comic character ; for instance, your priest. Upset mail-coaches, and
make horses run away with their riders continually: and be careful,
having bribed some clever artist to prostitute his talents, to have all
these intellectually humorous scenes illustrated, in order that your
readers may fully appreciate the only jokes they are likely to under-
stand. Put “an affair of honour” into about every other chapter; and
for the credit and renown of your country, you being an Irishman,
exhibit it as conducted with the most insensatelevity. Indeed, in fur.
therance of this object depict your countrymen in general as a set of
irrational, unfeeling, crazy blockheads; only not having sense enough
to be selfish, as lavish and prodigal in the extreme. Never mind
your plot, but string adventure upon adventure, without sequence or
connexion ; just remembering to wind up with a marriage. For ex-
ample, your hero may shoot some old gentleman through the head—
or hat—and run away with his niece, an heiress. Whenever you are

this month carried into the “Rookery, and the picturesque poverty
of that far-famed locality is very graphically depicted. The “Two-
penny Twist, we doubt not, will become a standard work. The
‘Squnjee-Bosh’ is a pleasing picture of Life in Hindostan, and the
description of the ‘Tiger Hunt’ which it contains, will be perused with
fearful interest. The subject is original, and powerfully treated. The
‘Lines to a Snow Drop' may vie with the happiest efforts of Words-
worth or Byron. ‘Tiddy Widdy' is fraught with the most killing
humour. The ‘Confessions of a Coxcomb' are characterised by comic
candour. “Continental Cookery’ will be devoured by the bon rirant.
‘Tailors and Things,’ ‘An Hour in an Eating House, and ‘A Brush
with the Brigands, are all first-rate in their way.”
Send the above piece of humbug, or one still more clumsy if you
like, to one of the newspapers; (not the “Times,” because therein
it will be printed with the heading “Advertisement”) and pay the
requisite fee for its insertion as an editorial review. By this means
you will obtain all the advantage which publicity can afford, coupled
with what the undiscerning, to whose capacity your periodical is
studiously to be adapted, will regard as respectable criticism. Get as
many other papers as are sufficiently venal and unprincipled, to copy,
for a “consideration,” the paragraph out, and you will speedily obtain
an increase in the sale of your Magazine, proportionate to the
number of fools whom you take in, and who, in return, will take
in you.
THE PRINCE OF WALES AND THE PRESS.
It has been announced to the public, through the medium of the
Press, that a most important epoch has arrived in the life of the Prince
of Wales. It is a strange fact, that this “important epoch" has not been
noted in the biography of any previous Princes of Wales; for we look in
vain through the pages of Hume and Smollett, Rapin, Lingard, Miss
Julia Corner, and indeed every other corner within our reach, without
being able to ascertain when Edward the Black Prince was driven from
the breast to the bottle. The Heir Apparent to the English throne
cool, TREAt Ment.
has, we are told, been lately subjected to this frightful vicissitude ; and
though His Royal Highness is said to have borne it tolerably well, it
would appoar that while he took to the pap-spoon with princely fortitude,
there was something of the infant perceptible in his mode of first
receiving it.
The nation cannot but sympathise with the feelings of the illustrious
baby under the late trying circumstances; and it is in contemplation to
lay an address of condolence at the foot of the Royal chair of wicker-
work. His mode of reconciling himself to the frightful reverse is looked
upon in the Palace as a fine augury of his future fortitude; and there can
be no doubt, that he who as a child could be weaned without injury, will
as a man rule over the nation as the nation ought to be ruled over.
There was virtue even in the Prince's tears; for it is reported that he
wept like a moral character, or, in other words, “cried like a good un,”

PUNCH2S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER XVIII.-ON SOCIAL FLATTERY: STORY OF THE DOG PONTO-
PiG AND PRUNE SAUCE.
My DEAR Sox,-Having in my last dwelt upon flattery, as necessary
to the success of a politician, I dedicate this letter to a consideration
of its utility to every man who would, by the exercise of his wits,
make his way in the world. There is a negative flattery—as there
is a positive flattery. A knowledge of the one is equally vital with
good graces of a man of wealth or interest. You hang and flutter
about him for the bounty of his purse, or the magic of his good word
in high places. This man may be a fool: I do not, understand me,
fall in with the vulgar cry of paupers, that every man who is born
rich is therefore born brainless; but your patron, or the man you
would make your patron, may be a fool; and, consequently, is the
more frequently tempted, like the climbing ape, to show his natural
destitution. I think it is Mr. Addison who says, “He who is injured,
and having brought his enemy on his knees, declines to punish him,
was born for a conqueror.” This is the sentiment, though not
perhaps the exact words; for I have long since put aside The Spec-
tator with your mother's cracked china. Mark, my son, a higher, a
severer test of magnanimity. He who hears the abortive jest of a
rich fool, yet refuses to turn his folly inside out, is born to finger
ready money. This, my son, is flattery by negative. Have what wit
you will, but carry it—as courtiers carry their swords in the royal
presence—in the scabbard. Suffer your patron to run you, as he
thinks, through and through with his wooden dagger of a joke; but
never let yourself be tempted to draw. Flattery has its martyrdom,
the same as religion—and this is of it. Bear all the wounds inflicted
upon you by wealth with a merry face; join in the laugh that's
raised against you; but, as you value success in life, never show an
inch of steel in self-defence. Men who do otherwise may be
chronicled for brave, expert wits; but they die beggars.
Come we now to positive flattery. Whatever dirty-shirted philo-
sophers may say to the contrary, flattery is a fine social thing ; the
beautiful handmaid of life, casting flowers and odoriferous herbs in
the paths of men, who, crushing out their sweets, curl up their noses
as they snuff the odour, and walk half an inch higher to heaven by
what they tread upon.
Your patron is an ass: you hear his braying—you see his ears :
asinus is written all over him in Nature's boldest round-hand. Well,
by delicately dwelling upon the melodious wisdom of his words—by
adroitly touching on the intellectual beauty with which fate has
endowed him, you make him for the time love wisdom because he
thinks it a part of himself—you draw his admiration towards the
expression of the intellectual every time he looks in a mirror. You
are thus, in an indirect way, serving the cause of wisdom and
intellect by juggling a fool into a worshipper. Let it be granted,
that you have your reward for this—that, in fact, you undertake the
labour for the wages of life: what of it? Is not the task worthy of
payment When men, in the highest places too, are so well paid
for fooling common sense, shall there be no fee for him who elevates
a nincompoop
You see an ass browsing upon thistles. On this, you fall into
raptures at his exquisite taste for roses; the ass, with great compla-
cency, avers that he always had a peculiar relish for them. The ass
brays. Wherefore you make a happy allusion to the vibrations of
the AEolian harp. The ass declares it is an instrument above all
others he is most inclined to. Are not roses and AEolian harps
thus honoured, even by the hypocrisy of admiration ?
Believe whatever the rich and powerful say; that is, seem to
believe it. Albeit they narrate histories wilder than ever Ariosto
fabled, averring themselves to have been eye and ear wit to
what they tell, yet, without a smile upon your face, gulp it all.
Though the stories be long and nauseous as tape-worms, yet swallow
them as though they were toothsome as maccaroni. You recollect Sir
Peter Bullhead Î He owed all his fortune to a dog. I will tell you
the story.
In early life, Sir Peter became footboy to Lord Tamarind; a man
who returned from the East Indies with a million of money, and his
liver no bigger than the roasted liver of a capon. Lord Tamarind
was a liar of the very finest courage. There was no story he would
not undertake, and make his own. Had he resolved upon it, he
would have been present at the siege of Troy, and, sure, have shown
you the knee-buckles he had, in single combat, won of Nestor.
Mercury must have been proud of him.
Lord Tamarind had a favourite story of a dog; which story he
would pull in upon all occasions. His Lordship, go where he would,
never went without his dog. “Very curious, indeed, very; and
talking of the great player reminds me of an extraordinary anecdote
of a dog. You never heard it, I know ; a remarkable case of
conscience,—very remarkable;” and then his Lordship proceeded—
his hearers meekly resigning themselves to the too familiar tale.
“You must know that in Batavia—it was when I was there—
there was a certain Dutch merchant; I mention no names, for I
respect his family. Well, this merchant—a shocking thing !—he
was a married man; sweet little woman—five or seven children, and
the practice of the other. For instance:–You would conciliate the
all that. Well, this merchant—very dreadful —kept a mistress,
country-house, and all things proper. Well, every evening he used
to leave his lawful home to pass an hour or two with the fatal syren.
He had a dog, a faithful, humble dog, that always followed him ;-
|
|
2
that was, moreover, greatly petted by the illegal onchantress. The
dog, being particularly fond of his lawful mistress, became, day
by day, very melancholy, sad, heavy-eyed, and moping". This arose
suspicions of hydrophobia—talk of poison, double-barrelled gun, and
all that. Still the dog followed his master on his evening call. One
evening, however—all day long it had been remarked that Ponto was
more than usually meditative—the dog paused at the Dalilah's door.
“Ponto, Ponto, cried the merchant, gaily entering the abode of
wickedness, and whistling his dog to follow him—“Ponto, Ponto '-
But the dog stood with his fore-feet on the door step, and wouldn't
budge. ‘Ponto, Ponto—sweet Ponto—good Ponto, cried the wicked
woman herself, coming to the door, and offering from her white hand
the whitest cake. Ponto was immovable. Then looking at his
master, the dog shook his head four or five times, as much as to say,
‘Arn’t you ashamed of yourself?'—sighed very deeply, and dropping
his tail, walked solemnly home. The merchant was so affected by
the dog's reproof–(all this happened while I was in Batavia,)—
that he followed Ponto back to his lawful hearth, and for the rest of
his natural life was never known to make an evening call again.”
Lord Tamarind had three nephews; he cut every one off with a
shilling for having boisterously expressed a doubt of the truth of
what had occurred whilst he was in Batavia; but Peter Bullhead,
who never failed to ask for the story of the dog—Peter, who had
* The sagacity of Ponto is nothing to the sensibility of the race of King Charles's
spaniels, that ever since the martyrdom of Charles the First, have betrayed an
inconsolable melancholy. The spaniels lost their liveliness when Charles lost his
head. We take this assurance from a French author. In the Journal des Chasseurs
ou Sporting Magazine Français, for March 1842, will be found the story, as related
by the Comte de St. P The Count was in the bois terriers in the autumn of
1841, shooting with a spaniel, when he falls in with an Englishman, who enlarges
in this way (as told by the Count) on the merits of spaniels generally :-
“Ce sont des quêteurs infatigables, medit-il ; excellens pour les fourrès, dontils

risen from footboy to his Lordship's secretary—inherited all the
personal property of the Eastern story-teller. My son, every rich
man has some sort of Ponto.
There will be occasions when it may be necessary for you to use
considerable address. You must not flatter one at the expense of
another; that is, when you have equal hopes of each. A friend of mine,
who had lived all his life at court, told me a story that will illustrate
what I mean. It happened that the king and queen were in the
green, and some of the courtiers with them. My friend was called
by the king. Now it happened that their majesties were so placed,
that my friend could not go to the king without turning his back—
an act at court only little less than high treason—upon the queen.
Here was a dilemma. “And how did you get out of the scrape f"
I asked my friend. “In this way,” he answered, “I walked sideways.”
I have known many men in life get to the golden gate of fortune by
walking every inch of the path—sideways.
In your flattery of mankind, you must also discriminate character,
lest you throw away a valuable commodity. I have known men so
unprincipled, that they have received the incense of adulation half
their lives, and, dying, have left the man who burnt his myrrh and
frankincense for them, nothing in reward but a miserable jest in the
codicil.
There was my poor friend Sniffton.
sauce as he hated a poor relative.
He hated pig and prune-
Nevertheless, for twenty years
did he consent to eat it at his uncle's table; nor could he find words:
rich enough wherewith to do honour to uncle's pig and prune-sauce.
Uncle died. “Thank heaven P’ cried Sniffton, “I shall now receive
my reward in hard cash for my sacrifice to that damned pig and
damned prune-sauce.” The will was read, and thus was Sniffton
rewarded :
“And I hereby give and bequeath to my dearly-beloved nephew,
Peter Sniffton, in consideration of his peculiar love of my pig and
prune-sauce,—the whole and sole recipe whereby he may cook it.”
My son, be wary, and avoid such wretches.
THE QUEEN'S VISIT TO WALMER.
The great length of our account of the proceedings on Lord Mayor's
Day, precluded the insertion, in our last, of the following particulars of the
royal visit to Walmer. We hasten to supply the omission. When it was
known on the road that the Queen and Prince Albert were going to pass,
the trustees of the Greenwich Turnpike gave orders that the gate should
be thrown wide open, so as to offer no impediment to the royal progress.
The toll contractor was himself on the spot at an early hour, and personally
superintended the cleaning of the glass over the clock that adorns the
toll-house. It having been determined to present Prince Albert with the
freedom of the gate, a copy of the ticket of the day was printed on white
satin, and was shown gratuitously to the friends of the toll contractor some
time before her Majesty was expected. At an early hour a couple of horse-
men galloped through the toll, exclaiming—“The Queen the Queen "
Express for Govºſt NMFNT.
But as the royal carriages did not soon follow, suspicion began to be
aroused ; and it was afterwards perfectly obvious that her Majesty's name
had been used by a brace of unprincipled villains for the purpose of
evading the turnpike. To guard against a recurrence of this fraud, the
gate was closed, and two individuals in pepper-and salt riding up about
an hour afterwards were stopped at the bar, it being supposed they were
in league with the others, and were trying the same fraudulent experi-
ment. Unfortunately, they turned out to be her Majesty's outriders; and
the mistake having occasioned a good deal of altercation, the freedom of
the Greenwich Gate, which was to have been presented in due form to
Prince Albert, was altogether forgotten.
A little farther on, the road presented an animated appearance. The
trustees of the highway had liberally repaired the whole line of milestones,
which wore a most cheerful aspect ; and a direction post on this side of
Rochester attracted the attention of the royal pair, by a large cluster of
evergreen, which completely covered the whole of the inscriptions in-
tended for the information of travellers.
The royal party changed horses several times on the route ; and at
each place where this ceremony was performed, an address was drawn
up by the hotel-keeper—in the form of a little account—which being
glanced at by the Prince was handed over to his treasurer, who answered
it in all cases in a manner that seemed to give the most perfect satisfac-
tion. Our own correspondent, who has taken a lodging in the neighbour-
hood of Walmer, writes to us very fully, and we lay before our readers
extracts from his letters:—
The weather here is windy. The room chosen for the royal nu º
greatly subjected to squalls. Her Majesty and Prince Albert have
several walks on the beach, and for the first time since they have been
married have known what it is to have a regular breeze.
Prince Albert has been out daily with his dogs in spite of the weather,
it being his Royal Highness's maxim that the dumb animals must have
exercise “whether or no;” and though it is said “every dog has his
day,” the Prince is resolved that every dog of his shall have every day for
enjoyment. -
Her Royal Highness the Princess has been presented with a wooden
spade, and has employed a portion of her leisure in digging small holes in
the sands, while her royal brother (“little Wales” as he is familiarly called)
has looked on at the operation with infantine interest.
Prince Albert has paid a visit to the Goodwin Sands, accompanied by
Dr. Proetorious, who pointed out to his Royal Highness the spot on which
the Light of All Nations was placed, and which had assisted the wreck
of a vessel that run it down, and happily put an end to it. Dr. Proetorious
explained to his royal pupil that Earl Goodwin had formerly resided upon
these sands; but after a long search for his abode, the Prince and the
Doctor returned to Walmer.
The Queen and Prince Albert have paid a visit to Deal, and expressed
themselves highly gratified at the reception they met with ; for there
being nobody in the streets of that dull and dreary town, nothing occurred
to interfere with the privacy of the royal visitors. The Mayor muttered
an address at the gates, but he was neither seen nor heard by the
illustrious party, who passed on without taking any notice whatever of the
discomfited authority.
The royal couple went one day last week to Sandwich, and were met
by several of the corporation. Prince Albert congratulated them on their
love of agriculture, observing that grass was growing luxuriantly in the
streets of their ancient and fertile city. His Royal Highness declared also,
that much as he had heard of the Sandwich flats, he should never have
known what the Sandwich flats really were, if he had not met with the
authorities of the place alluded to. Dr. Proetorious recommended that the
royal party should take luncheon, and the Queen, in order to encourage
the commerce of the place, called for a dish of sandwiches. The Mayor
explained that Sandwich was the place Caesar selected for landing when
he invaded England, and her Majesty observed aside to her royal consort,
that “she could not say much for the taste of the Roman Emperor.”
Our correspondent has continued his lodging for another week, and if
anything of consequence transpires, he has promised to write to us.
- - - - -
GUY FAWKES’ DAY.
The 5th of November being Guy Fawkes' Day, was kept as a general
holiday in juvenile circles; and several novelties in Fawkeses were
visible. The chapeau de papier blanc was very much in request; and
pantaloons, which had been flat at nothing (lying, in fact, neglected in the
thoroughfares), picked up astonishingly on the eve of the great gun-
powder festival.
An old TrAINER.
Amongst the displays of fire-works, we particularly noticed the fol-
lowing:—Master Smith—A squib of much brilliancy. Master Jones—
A splendid feu de joie, consisting of a Catharine wheel and a Waterloo
cracker.
There was a bonfire on the vacant ground opposite Bedlam, and the
policeman on duty, who had received instructions to act upon his own
discretion, stood by and enjoyed “the lark” for four hours.
The consumption of Guy Fawkeses has been ascertained to be 0009 less
than in the year 1841, being an average of #xx}} in the last four
years; and giving one Guy Fawkes to every five thousand boys, we get
at the quantity of old clothes devoted to these occasions—a result which
is so obvious, that we think it superfluous to put it down in figures. A
house in Holywell-street, that used to sell four cocked-hats, has only been
asked for one—and there the bargain went off; so that the old Fifth-of-
November-Guy-Fawkes-cocked-hat trade must be considered to be done
for. Here is another instance of the good (1) that has been effected by
-Sir R. Peel's new Tariff.

THE WRONGS OF THE STOMACH.
By the “Wrongs of the Stomach,” Punch does not mean—
“The whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely
The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes;”
nor the Income Tax, nor the New Poor Law, nor the thousand and
one other grievances which we are obliged to swallow, and which
stick so plaguily in our gizzards. He speaks literally, intending, by
the word Stomach, that musculo-membranous bag or cavity which
is the principal organ of Digestion—the prime agent in the transub-
stantiation of Meat into Man.
That he may bespeak due attention for his subject, let him, in the
first place, assert its dignity. “Magister Artium Venter;” “the
Stomach the Master of Arts,” not “a Master of Arts” as the title has
been incorrectly translated. The Stomach is thus designated because
the Arts owe their cultivation to the necessity of living, that is to say,
of eating. Man derives his boots from his neighbour's belly. From
this source, also, proceed not merely the Mechanical, but also the
Fine Arts. Composition is the parent of Cookery, and the purveyor
of mental delicacies labours in his vocation from the love of viands.
Handel, when he wanted to hit on something good was wont to indulge
in some good thing. Dr. Johnson wrote at one time for his daily
dinner, and always with a prospective view towards provender. He
is reported to have said, “Sir, a man who will not take care of his
belly, will hardly take care of anything else !”
But the Stomach is more than a mere task-master. It is quite
certain that no books can be written without brains, though some are
with very little. Now, the brain, like the rest of the body, is built
up of food. From the Stomach, therefore, the soul derives its
instrument; and thus beef and mutton are converted into the organs
of thought. There is no doubt that Shakspere ate, and perhaps an
extract of pork chops assisted in the excogitation of Ariel.
Be it observed, in illustration of the preceding remarks, that the
Rookery, so to speak of Literature, was known in former times, by
the name of Grub-street.
The especial office of the Stomach is to eliminate, from the matters
consigned to it, the substance of nutrition ; which, “PUNCH* may
inform his readers in general, is denominated chyme, and now they know
about as much respecting Digestion as the College of Physicians—
or that of Health. For the maintenance of the human body in its
due bulk and condition, it is requisite that the Stomach should make
a certain regular quantity of this stuff, so much, and no more,
according to individual exigencies, out of what is put into it daily.
It is therefore like a manufactory (except that it works but little on
the raw material), which, from a given amount of goods ought to
furnish a stated product.
Now the “Wrongs of the Stomach” are threefold. It has generally
either too much, or not enough, or bad work to do. Thus is it as well
the fittest emblem, as the most cherished organ, of John BULL. Let
us at present consider it as being overworked—as the victim of ruth-
less oppression.
“There is figures,” says Fluellen, “in all things.” As it is in the
body politic so is it in the body natural. Oppression is begotten of
luxury. The great tyrants of the Stomach are the Aristocracy, espe-
cially the Aristocracy of Mammon. Nothing, probably, would more
extensively redress the grievances of the Corporation than Corporate
Reform. Of all the oppressors thereof, the most flagrant are indis.
putably the Court of Aldermen. What drudgery, to be sure, it has
to undergo on Lord Mayor's Day !
Observe the career of a civic gourmand, “ab oro usque ad mala; "-
from soup to dessert. His outrages upon his poor paunch are almost
systematic. He commences, probably, by administering to it a flog-
ging in the shape of a dram; and this, most likely, ere it has yet half
recovered from the lashes of a dinner pill, which it received an hour
ago. . How ungrateful! It has grown old and feeble in his service;
and, instead of giving it that gentle work to which alone it is compe:
tent, and now and then indulging it with a holiday, he treats it as a
cabman does his horse—who establishes a raw in the animal's flank,
and mercilessly whips it up hill.
Having thus made his Stomach mighty to suffer, our Citizen
proceeds, with cruel deliberation, to inflict upon it the utmost it will
bear. He literally subjects it to the peine forte et dure, though it pleads
loudly enough, and with bitter murmurings, against the savage injus-
tice. In the first place, he inundates it with a flood of turtle soup,
which he contpels it, by means of strong-iced punch, to dispose of
Wol. III.-1842.
He then loads it with as much turbot or salmon as it will bear, “and
more;’ whereunto, with anchovy, soy, and cayenne pepper, he forces
it hardly to submit. Here, as the North American savages use in
tormenting a prisoner, he for a season intermits with cruel mercy his
inhumanities; nerving, by the stimulus of a glass or two of sherry,
HAwing A STANDING AT THE BAR.
his victim for the renewal of suffering. And now, its energies
having been resuscitated by a brief repose, he heaps, upon it, as
many pounds of venison as he dares; nor is it a little, indeed, that
he does dare. He cheats it, moreover, into the quieter endurance of
this burden, by the insidious blandishments of currant jelly; just as
Sir Robert Peel devised the New Tariff to get down the aforemen-
tioned Income Tax. Nor must the little make-weights of bread,
potatoes, turnips, asparagus, beans, broccoli, and other vegetable
matters, which accompany his more substantial mouthfuls be omitted,
because the quantity of them which he consumes would dine a
moderate family.
A second time the wretched Stomach has reached the acme of
tolerance; but its cries are drowned in an ocean of somebody's
“Entire;” its injuries are washed down: it must bear yet more. It
has now to put up with an oyster patty or two—which its tyrant calls
* beginning over again.” It next groans beneath a weight of capon ;
but is humbugged into resignation by champagne. ... After this, the
whole or greater part of a partridge, with a ladle full of bread sauce,
is forced upon it; succeeded by a ponderous mast of plum-pudding,
tart, jelly, blanc-mange, and custard. On this mountain of aliment
is piled bread and cheese enough for a labourer's luncheon, and
another Atlantic of ale or beer is infused upon the enormous mass.
The whole huge hodge-podge is crowned with fruit and walnuts, and
saturated throughout its immensity by ponds of port: the poor
suffering Stomach being thus drugged into a helpless insensibility
which deprives it of the power of rebellion.
Now, what is the consequence of all this misuse of the Stomach
The next day it strikes work;-becomes a disturbed district, and
is with difficulty dragooned into obedience. And, after all, it is
subdued greatly at the expense of the whole bodily estate, if not with
serious detriment to the constitution; which becomes replete with
disorders.

CRUelTY To Animals.
The enactments relative to this offence exemplify, in an eminent
degree, that spirit of class legislation which is the vice of our political
system. The great brutes are protected, while the smaller creatures
may be victimised with impunity. Now, while equine sonsibilities
are respected, while the costermonger, declaring-
“If I had a donkey wot wouldn't go,
Just wouldn't I wallop him 1"
is limited in the power of the cudgel by the
“No, no, no!”
of Mr. Martin's Bill; while the butcher is compelled to kill his sheep
with kindness, or “dance to the echo of his feet” for a fortnight, in
company with the rogue and the beggar; while, also, where bishops
used to be roasted alive, it is a crime to baste a bullock; while, in
short, the aristocracy of the animal kingdom are hedged round by
Acts of Parliament, the many are abandoned to the oppressor. The
domestic carnivora, we believe, are among the privileged classes; but
nothing, that we have ever heard of, under a cat, is recognised as a
sensitive being. Indeed it is only of late that the claims of the latter
animal (notwithstanding its belonging to the feline race) to consider-
ation, have been allowed. Now there is no doubt that the rat and
the mouse have as much feeling as the elephant;-let him who enter-
tains any, pinch one of the so-called rodentia by the tail, whereupon
the creature will assuredly squeak, and in all probability make him
squeak too. Eels, when skinned alive, wriggle, although used to it
so long, as if they felt decidedly uncomfortable; and though we never
took the dying deposition of a black-beetle, we have the word of a
poet that it expires as unpleasantly as a son of Anak. If this be true,
the same may be predicated of the cockroach, the chafer, the earwig,
the flea, and the bug; indeed, of all sorts of vermin, friendly or un-
friendly to man—of whose sufferings we make, in general, as little
account as if they were so many paupers. As to the insect last men-
tioned, it was deliberately proposed, but the other day, to destroy it
by pinning it down to a table and reading debates to it until it burst
—though this proposition, to be sure, emanated from slave-tormenting
America. Surely this partiality is unjust : how can it be accounted
for 1 “De minimis non curat Ler;” “the Law does not care about very
small things;” and why? because it is made by the Great.
A question here arises, which we do not pretend to solve, because
it is incapable of solution, as we need not write a volume of meta-
physics to prove :—“Where are we to draw the line !” It is not easy
to see where we can draw it philosophically; whereas, if we are to
make no distinction at all, the obligation of “Justice to Animalcules”

We have noticed an advertisement in the daily papers which states that
the author of “The M. P.'s Wife” has just completed a new work called
“The M. D.'s Daughter.” In case this gentleman should be at a loss for
future subjects we beg to suggest “The F.R.A.S.'s Grandmother,” “The
M.R.C.S.'s Brother-in-law,” or “The LL.D.'s second Son by his first

THE MEDICAL STUDENTS.
(New Series.)
Gº APTIER IV.-or THE MANNER in which JAck. RANDALI, Ann
Jºº. 81 MPSON BRIGGS DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES IN PUBLIC.
ONE fine afternoon, towards the close of the session, there was a
notice put up on the board where the public information was gene-
rally posted, stating that Mr. Poddy, the anatomical lecturer, could not
meet his class that day at two o'clock as usual. The reason assigned for
his absence was an important post-mortem examination, some little
distance out of town; and this was subsequently found to be correct,
the subject in question being a very fine turkey at a friend's house,
with an accompanying piece of more minute dissection in the shape of a
saddle of mutton. The question of what they should do immediately
rose among the students. Some of them, who were expecting their
examination shortly, went home to read; but the majority, including
Jack Randall and Briggs, thought it best to stop and indulge in a
little harmony and half-and-half in the dissecting-room. People of
delicate nerves or fine feelings might perhaps imagine that a more
fitting locality might be chosen for conviviality than the spot just
mentioned, but as medical students cannot in general afford very fine
feelings, and are only conscious of the existence of nerves in the
extremities that come under their hands for dissection, they are not
very particular respecting the scene of their revels. Accordingly,
our friends were in high glee before a quarter of an hour had elapsed.
They had drawn a table towards the fire, round which they were
assembled, the article of furniture being literally a festive board, and
a goodly circle they formed. Jack Randall was, of course, in the
chair, or rather on the highest stool, and was entertaining the com-
pany with the account of a row he once got into at Epsom races,
where he fought four thimble-rig men at once, and was obliged to
sleep all night at some particular part of the Warren, in consequence
of being too much overcome by poverty and brandy-and-water to get
back to town. At the same time he illustrated the respective loca-
lities connected with the event, by drawing plans on the table in
half-and-half with his finger. Mr. Newcome, who had now arrived
at his third session, was seated on one side of the fireplace, using, a
fire-shovel to cook some “brown bait,” as Randall termed a bundle
of sprats which lay on the mantel-piece. Mr. Beans, a man from the
country, next told a story, instead of singing, about some adventures
he had when he was an apprentice, which nobody could recollect
when he had finished, but which, nevertheless, Mr. Beans took great
delight in narrating; quite unconscious that, during the recital, Jack
Randall was filling the pocket of his apron with sawdust, cinders,
and all the heads and tails of sprats that he could collect. Then
after much pressing, Mr. Simpson Briggs indulged the company in
the exhibition of various artful problems and keen puzzles, with
short bits of tobacco pipe; and concluded by singing a song—a
crime of which he was only guilty after the second pint—involving
many curious speculations on the respective comforts enjoyed by the
Pope and Sultan ; and concluding with the affirmation that he would
sooner be himself—Mr. Simpson Briggs—than either of them. Mr.
Newcome applauded the performance, by rattling the poker between
the bars of the grate; and Mr. Beans, who was getting sentimental
at the last verse, contented himself with marking the time, in grace-
ful measure, with his pipe; whilst he threw a glance of mingled
interest and affection at a crumb of Abernethy biscuit that lay on the
table.
As the contents of the pewters disappeared, the mirth and noise
gradually increased. The choruses, which had hitherto been sung
in time and tune, grew louder and more prolonged, until every one
joined in at the top of his voice, with any particular air or words that
came uppermost. Jack Randall took upon himself to conduct the
orchestra, which he did a la Jullien, with much satisfaction to himself,
using a humerus as a baton; and Briggs kept up a pleasing accompa-
niment by rattling a vertebra and a penny-piece in a quart pot. At
last, they kicked up such a tremendous riot, that the lecturer on the
Practice of Physic, who had been holding forth to a class of five, in
the theatre, since three o'clock, sent in word by the porter, to say,
that if the gentlemen did not immediately vacate the dissecting-room,
and either go home, or come in to his lecture, he would report the
whole of them to the Board of Governors. Whereupon, choosing
the least of two evils, the majority rose to go home, and Jack
Randall and Briggs, feeling somewhat inclined to feed, began to think
about dinner, and started for the eating-house they usually patronised,
in company with Beans and Newcome. The restaurateur's was not
far off, and they all entered, one after another, like policemen
stamping on the floor in such regular time, as they marched to the
end of the room, and with such energy, that they frightened all the
other customers, and caused one gentleman of delicate fibre, to pour
his pint of porter into his hat, whilst he looked another way after our
friends.
Jº Jº tº
s
FashionABLE INTELLIGENCE,
The dinner passed off as most eating-house dinners do, very hastily ;
and the reckoning being settled, they rose to depart. Previous to
this, however, Jack Randall emptied the salt-cellar into the decanter
of Preissnitz as he called it; whilst Briggs, who was getting rather
jocose, and whose hand very much resembled a shoulder of mutton
cut into five strips, squeezed the tops of all the pewter pots together,
having first filled them with potato-skins. -
Beans and Newcome here left them, for they were working for the
anatomical prize, and had each invested a shilling in the purchase of
half a pound of coffee, to keep them awake whilst they made out the
diagram they had copied at lecture—a series of elaborate drawings,
which their landlady presumed to be puzzles, or plans for getting
into the Mazes at Hampton Court and Rosherville Gardens. . Jack
Randall and Briggs therefore were left to themselves, and not feeling
much inclined to go home, agreed to wander about for any amuse:
ment chance might turn up. At last they got into Clare Market, and
this refined quarter of the town offered them, no end of subjects for
their temporary drolleries; as they indulged in unmitigated chaff
with the keepers of the stalls that bordered the pavement; and who
had illuminated their wares with tallow candles sheltered in paper
bags, that cast a mellow and subdued light over the gasping flounders,
consumptive garden-stuff; sleepy pears; and lucifers, whelks.5traps,
apples, and periwinkles, that are the staple commodities of the district.
Jack Randall asked every policeman he met if he was at Water-
loo, and Mr. Briggs inquired where he bought his oilskin cape,
because he wished one like it; with other pleasant outpourings of
great minds giving way to light relaxation from the graver duties of
the accident-wards, and the dissecting-rooms.
“I’d like to looshe some monies vid you,” said a son of Israel, as
they passed his magazine of second-hand clothes. -
Jack Randall immediately offered, with extreme politeness, to part
with the paper lining of his hat upon very advantageous terms:
“I’ll be happy to wait upon you at homesh, if you've got clothes to
part vid.”
“Oh I've got lots,” replied Randall, “when can you come p
“Any vensh,” was the reply.
Whereupon Jack wrote down the address of Mr. Poddy, the Pro-
fessor of Anatomy, and told the Jew to go there the next morning,
before ten. They then walked on towards Drury Lane, when they were
accosted by another barker at the door of a similar establishment,
as follows:—
“Any things to shell ?”
“Do you want a shirt f" asked Briggs. -
“I should think you did,” returned the Israelite.
“You’ve got it now,” said Randall, laughing; “that was a thorough
sell.” -
“I shan't chaff the peoplesh any more,” observed Briggs; “but he
nad evidently been asked the same question before, from the readiness
of his reply.”
They entered Drury Lane,and were immediately beset by the people
with play-bills, from each of whom Jack Randall took a bill with a
low bow, and carried it in his hand some little distance, until the
vender demanded payment; when he directly returned it, begging
their pardon for the mistake, but saying that he thought, from their
pressing solicitations, he was doing them a kindness in taking one.
“Did you ever go to a concert, Simmy fº inquired Jack.
“Oh, yes,” returned his friend; “very, frequently : at the Hanover
Square Rooms, and also at the Horns, at Kennington."
* Oh, you mean the ten-and-sixpenny toucher,” said Randall.
“To be sure; and don't you?” ----
“Oh no, my man. I allude to the penny melody for the million, at
a musical tavern.”
“I have never had that pleasure.”

CHILD SNOBSON'S PILGRIMAGE.
1.
CHILD + Snobson bask'd him in the summer sun,
Disporting there like any other fly,
But into debt the Child had early run,
And his resources were exceeding dry,
Which made him of his creditors so shy,
That he would turn into another street,
And cut his way through courts and alleys bye,
Rather than venture with a dun to meet,
Who with a curs'd account his startled gaze might greet.

But now, Child Snobson—he was sick at heart,
And anxious from the hateful world to flee;
For he would watch the foreign steam-boats start,
And the big tear would roll into his ee,
When it would dart across his mind that he
Had not the cash far nations to explore ;
For none may cross the wide—the boundless sea,
Unless for berths in cabin chief, or fore,
They something have to pay—it may be less or more.f
III.
And none did love the Child, for e'en at school,
They used to flog him with a tyrant hand;
And they did often call him dolt or fool,
Because strange things he could not understand;
Surely the birch is no magician's wand,
Although they laid it on the Child's poor back:,
As if of greatest things it was most grand
To educate an urchin in a crack,
And lay his learning on, in vulgar language, smack.
* Child is another term for man. It is a wrong term, but I have heard persons
far advanced in years address each other as “my boy '" and why shall I not call
our hero Child?–Byron has done so.

These things he long had left, and now prepares
His home, his friends, his kindred, all to quit—-
Aye, and his fire-side—up three-pair-of-stairs,
Where he had not been given much to sit,
For at each ring strange fears would o'er him flit,
As if there were an omen in the bell $,
That spoke of some unexecuted writ.
And so he thought it would be quite as well
To go—but where 1 alas, the Child could scarcely tell.

He would have gone to where the hungry Gaul ||
Receives the Saxon with a courteous smile ;
Where cockneys straight from Bow, or perhaps St. Paul,
In summer flock, their leisure to beguile;
And at Boulogne, a week away to while.

Had not sufficient cash to leave the isle ;
And so he call'd, and got into a cab :—
Then thus the Child did sing—at songs he was a dab.

THE CHASE.
Mn. Jones's hound was unkennelled on Monday morning, and a fine run
wns the immediate consequence. Having met with the famous Lambeth
terriers or tarriers, so called from their habit of loitering or tarrying about
the Marsh and the New Cut, the whole pack got scent of game, and puss
had a smart run for it. She bolted in fine style down the centre of the
Cut, and at last took shelter in,the end of a water-spout, where “the pack”
were unable to follow her. After a time, puss broke away, and led her
pursuers through a stiff tract of market baskets, potato cams, and apple
stalls, when having skirted the kerb-stone at a terrific pace, she eventually
got clear off among a pile of cabbages.

We have nothing to do with Theatrical quarrels, and that is the reason
why we think ourselves called upon to interfere in them. We think it is
a pity that Macready could not agree with Madame Westris, but if he
could not, it is to be regretted—and we, who only speak for the good of
all parties, are sorry for it. But if Webster reaps the benefit, we, (who
wish well to Webster, and who have always said so, and see no reason
why Webster himself should have thought otherwise, though managers
are always surrounded by a certain set whose interest it is to stand well
with their employers,) shall not perhaps regret the circumstance. We
have heard that it is in contemplation to build a new Theatre for the
performance of National Opera. We thought there were already Theatres
enough ; but we dare say we were wrong, as we generally are when we
trust to our own judgment, which we have a full right to do, though
every body else is quite justified in placing no reliance whatever in it.
We suppose the parties who are going to enter into the speculation,
if there are any such parties, know what they are about—that is, if they
are about anything. It is said National Opera is to be performed ; but we
seldom believe what we hear said, though we frequently repeat it, but as
no one believes us, there is no great harm done.
Werner is to be the subject of the Drury Lane Pantomime, and
as we have often said that we should not expect to see any one in the part
of Werner, at Drury Lane, but the lessee himself, we have got our-
selves into somewhat of a cleft-stick with regard to the cast of the Christ-
mas novelty. But, as we have said over and over again, we only speak
for the good of everybody, though it would be more for the good of our-
selves if we were to keep silent. We had rather see all the theatres
flourishing at once ; but if they cannot, we do not see why we are to be
blamed, though there are always parties in a theatre who walk about
expressing their dissatisfaction with everything.
THE LOWEST OF THE LOWE.
If “Punch” ever felt himself called upon to lay aside his good humour,
and resort freely to the use of his bâton, it is on the occasion of the en-
gagement of Miss Alice Lowe at the City of London Theatre. The claims
of this person to become a heroine of the stage are much upon a par with
those of Jack Sheppard to be exalted into its hero. If it be desirable to
show “Wice its own image,” there could not perhaps be a better model in
paint and chalk than that which Miss Alice Lowe has presented. This
woman has been underlined and red-lettered in the bills, Egyptianized in
large type upon , the posters, and proclaimed upon the walls of the
Metropolis, as “the victim of unmerited persecution.” Of Lord Frank-
fort's conduct there is but one opinion; but if Vice happens, in its shame-
less and sordid career, to meet with oppression where it looked only for
fame, we should be satisfied with seeing that the oppressor is defeated,
without trying to raise Vice into a subject for sympathy.
The Managers of the City of London Theatre must be regarded as the
worst enemies that the stage ever had, for they have given a handle to the
foes of the drama to declare that depravity finds upon the stage a ready
welcome and a congenial locality. We think the Theatrical profession
should take some step to resent the indignity that has been offered to it,
and we particularly pity the deplorable condition of those performers,
whose engagement has forced them to act with the miserable woman who
at present forms a member of Messrs. Dunn and Cockerton's Company.
Lord Huntingtower justifies the act of a nobleman turning horsedealer,
on the ground that “the horse is a noble animal;" and that his Lordship
enly increased his aristocratic connexions in having so much to do with
them.
BALLADS OF THE BOYS.
No. II.--THE POST-BOY.
I'm a dashing Post-Boy, bold and free,
As along the road I trot;
But a moral cloud o'erhangeth me,
For they call me what I'm not.
And on my mind it often preys,
My conscience it much doth annoy,
Though my whiskers and hair, like my horses, are greys,
They speak of me still as a boy.
Oh! why am I forced to embody a lie,
And glaringly shame the truth;
For at sixty years old a Post-Boy am I–
I'm age, in the jacket of youth.
Oh 1 well may the hard with a sigh exclaim
“Who would not a boy again be '"
You may put on the jacket, and take the name,
But who'd be a boy like me?
The name and the jacket are both sown,
The type of juvenile years;
Juvenal's satiars.
But the post-boy's heart has older grown,
And age on his brow appears.
But, away with thought!—it can but away-
Then let me not care a pin; ,
But I'll act the part of a jolly old boy,
And order a-go of gin.
Then, drink to the post-boy!—Hip, hurrah!
Let each one a bumper fill ;
For that, my boys, is the only way
Of making us buoyant still.
- - -
Yes, such was the hectic post-boy's song ;
But a drop came into his eye;
Though the truth he loved, yet he drank so long,
He was caught at last in a lie.
PETTY LARCENY AND COURT NEWS.
OUR elegant contemporary, the “Illustrated News,” has certainly been

written the annexed paragraph, which appeared in the columns of our

foot, and unattended by any members of the royal establishment, Except
three Scotch terriers, and one of the Prince's hounds.”
PHILOSOPHICAL INQUIRY.
What becomes of all the Pins 2 says a paper involving some singular
points of manufacturing economy. It appears from Professor Parrington
that twenty millions of pins are daily manufactured in this country.
These get into general circulation, and, after a time, .# disappear;
but the remarkable fact is, that, like the swallows, nobody knows where
they go to. It is proved that, were it possible to recal these lost articles,
a quantity might be collected sufficient to build the projected foot-bridge
at Hungerford Market, and the residue might be cast into one enormous
Pin, which should be erected as a column in any part of London best
suited for its elevation; and to be called Victoria's Pin, in opposition to
Cleopatra's Needle at Alexandria. There would be a winding staircase
in the interior, with a saloon in its head; and it might serve as a land-
mark, in stormy weather, for the fourpenny Steam-boats plying between
Vauxhall and London Bridge.
Thr case of the poor shirt-makers has raised the public choler. It will, however,
hardly be believed that when three half-pence is paid for making a shirt, the unhappy
needle-worker is expected also to make a shift with it.

KING ARTHUR.
The production of King Arthur on its present scale of unrivalled gor-
geousness, at Drury Lane, has set our contemporaries to work in looking
up the particulars of Dryden's life ; but King Arthur himself has been
passed over in these researches somewhat contemptuously. In a choice
and rare volume, with the words “Marks, Long-lane, Smithfield,” in
the imprint, we meet with a short poem called King Arthur's Pudding,
which must have escaped the nice scholarship of the Lessee of Drury-
Lane Theatre, or we should certainly have been gratified by the pudding
having been included in the late revival. The first stanza begins thus:-
When good King Arthur ruled this land
He was a godly King—
This allusion to his Majesty's piety is somewhat abruptly followed up
by the .# announcement in the next couplet, showing the state of
public morals during the reign of the good Arthur, which allowed him to
be guilty of a petty theft, and yet retain his character for godliness.
He stole three pecks of barley-meal,
To make a bread-pudding.
It must be inferred from this that the royal larder was but ill supplied,
and that Arthur's civil list was, to say the least of it, extremely shabby.
sweating. A sover-rign.
In the next verse we have a curious picture of the domestic economy of
Arthur's palace. The Sovereign is represented in the act of performing
the ordinary office of a menial :—
A bag-pudding the King did make,
And stuffed it well with plums,
And in it put great lumps of fat
As big as my two thumbs.
There is something highly practical in leaving the reader uncertain as
to the size of “the lumps of fat;” for, as the bard himself is not known,
the size of his thumbs must be matter of still greater uncertainty.
“Mystery is the mother of sublimity,” says an acute writer (we mean
ourself); and there is something truly Miltonian in the vagueness thrown
over the size of the lumps of fat put by King Arthur into his pudding.
Perhaps, however, the concluding stanza is the crowning one of the
poem. e give it entire :-
The King and Queen did eat thereof,
And noblemen beside;
And what they could not eat that night,
The Queen, next morning, fried.
Here is a picture of royal economy which is highly creditable to
Arthur's Court; and we wonder that Mr. Macready did not introduce,
among the magnificent series of visions, a tableaur representing Mrs.
Nisbett frying, the “next morning,” that portion of King Arthur's pudding
which had not been eaten overnight by their Majesties and the noblemen
who partook of it. The frying scene, with a few bars of Cook(e), would
have presented an admirable contrast to the frost scene, with the music
of Purcell. We wonder that the Management of Drury-Lane. Theatre
overlooked this fine opportunity of giving completeness to their late
revival.

PUNCH2S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER XIX. —THE PHILOSOPHY OF DRUNKENNESS.–THE GENius OF
THE CORK.
MY DEAR Boy.—I know few things that tell so fatally against a
young man, when entering the world, as a weak head and a delicate
stomach. I therefore earnestly entreat you to fortify both by every
means that may present themselves. It is true, that the increasing
effeminacy of the world requires of the ingenuous youth a less
capacity for the bottle than when I was young; nevertheless, there
are occasions, when a man's previous habits and education will be
tested by vintner's measure. Can there be anything more disgusting
than to see a young man after, say, the third bottle, in a maudlin
state of drunkenness? What tricks he perpetrates How he lets
all the world peep through the loop-holes of his soul; and how they
who spy, grin at him and chuckle over the exhibition : What, too,
is the end of this I have known an otherwise promising young
fellow so forget himself, as to render back in the most ungracious
manner the hospitality of the host, who—suppressing his indignation
by contempt—has ordered the servants to take off the gentleman's
cravat, and lay him upon the mat for recovery. Then what running
to and fro for vinegar ! what wet towels for the temples what hints,
in desperate cases, of the lancet ! until at length the wretched victim
rolls from side to side, and gargles his throat with—“better—better
—m-uch better l’” this is not only disgusting, it is unprofitable.
No, my son; never get drunk—that is, in company, above the
girdle. There is a thermometer of drunkenness which every wise
young man who has to elbow his way through the world would do
well to consider. A man may be knee-drunk—hip-drunk—shoulder-
drunk—nay, chin-drunk; but the wine should be allowed to rise no
higher. Then he sits with a fine fluency of speech—his countenance
brightened, his wit irradiated by what he has swallowed. And,
perhaps, there is no situation in mortal life which so magnificently
vindicates the ethereal nature of man, as that which presents him to
us triumphing with rosy face above the mists and clouds of wine that
roll around him : he is like the peak described by the poet: although
vapours obscure it midway—
“Eternal sunshine settles on its head.”
There he sits 1 His toes, it is true, may be of clay—but his head is
of lustrous gold. Like the oracles of the ancient day, he speaks
wisdom through the clouds that circle him 1
My son, by all means labour to arrive at this blessed, this most
profitable condition. Then, though you stumble a little on going
away, your stumbling will never be seen; for the potency of your
head and stomach has survived the observation of your co-drinkers;
and thus, though you are helped to your hackney-coach, a wine-skin,
a very Silenus up to the shoulders, you have the unclouded head of
Socrates to adorn them . How many a worthy gentleman lives and
dies with an undeniable character for sobriety, from having only kept
his head above the port | A character is to be saved like a life, by
merely keeping its chin above the fluid it swims in.
To obtain this power requires, I allow it, great practice: therefore,
as a scholar, make your bottle your private companion. Take your
liquor, as you would take your book, in profoundest solitude. “Try
conclusions” with yourself in your own garret, that you may achieve
victories in other men's dining-rooms.
I know that shallow, inexperienced moralists declaim against what
they are pleased to call the vice of solitary drinking. Why, there
is no such thing. A man can no more drink alone, than he can
drink without his shadow.
Pop | There—the cork’s drawn. Gurgle—gurgle—gurgle—good—
ood—No 1 it is in vain; there is no type—there are no printed
sounds (alow me the concetto)—to describe the melody, the cadence
of the out-pouring bottle. Well, the bottle has rendered its virgin
soul. You have resolved to sate yourself upon its sweetness. You
think yourself alone. Oh, the vanity of ignorance Why, the
cup of what is called a solitary drinker, drawn from the bottle, is an
audible charm that calls up a spirit—(angel or devil according to con-
tending moralists)—to come and sit with the toper. You have,
therefore, only to retire with a full bottle to your own garret to be
sure of company—and of the most profitable sort too; for your com-
panion carries away no drop of your liquor; but there he sits with
a jocund, leering look, on that three-legged stool; and there he tells
stories to you—and sings to your rapturous spirit—and now hangs
your white-washed walls with Sidonian tapestries—and now fills
your gaping pockets with ideal gold 1
What a world are you in 1 How your heart grows and grows I
TI-
and with frantic benevolence you rend aside your waistcoat (how
you'll hunt for the two dropt buttons in the morning !) to give the
creature room for its uttermost expansion 1 What a figure you
resolve to make in the world ! What woman—nay, what women—
you will marry Now, you are gathering roses with dallying houris,
—and now (with old Ronsard)—
“Peschant ne scay quelles plerres
Aubord de l'Indique mer.”
And whilst you take your flight here and there, how the spirit evoked
by the cork hugs himself, and grins at you !
It is by such discipline, my son, that you will be enabled when in
society to maintain the look and something of the reasoning powers
of a man, when your whole carcase is throbbing with alcohol. You
will also find a bottle the handmaid (bottles are, evidently, feminine)
of philosophy. After every night's good set in with the genius of the
cork, you will be the better able to judge of the true value of all worldly
endowments. You will also have a finer, a deeper, a more enlarged
comprehension of the weakness of human nature. If, before, you
were not sufficiently impressed with the utility of money; you will,
shortly after every visit of the genius of the cork, know its increasing
beauty. It may be, too, you have not paid sufficient attention to
that wondrous machinery—that complex simplicity of the human
animal—that you have not essentially considered your immortal
essence to be what it really is—
“A soul, hung up as 'twere in chains
Of nerves, and arteries, and veins !”
This inattention will be remedied—this ignorance informed—by fre-
quent appeals to the bottle. You will, in a short time, acknowledge
the exquisite sensibility of the nerves; for you shall not be able to
lift your morning tea-cup without marvelling at the wondrous
machinery vibrating before you. And the tongue, too, that delicate
instrument of silver sound—that shall lie like dry dirt in your mouth,
heavy, hot, and voiceless And from this you will learn and feel
that man is clay, and be at once raised and humbled by the know-
ledge.
Depend upon it, the bottle is the spring, the true source of all
human inspiration—the fountain from which all philosophers, all
sages, have drunk their wisdom.
What would have been Newton without a bottle Do you think
he would ever have made his grand discovery unless he had dined
first. Sitting in his orchard he saw an apple fall (what a part have
apples played in human history !), and as it fell it turned and turned.
Do you imagine that Newton would have been so delicately sus-
ceptible of the turning of a pippin, if he had not that day drawn a cork 1
Struck with the nascent idea, he called for another bottle,_and then
for another; and when the philosopher had pondered upon the apple,
had worked his analogies, and had drunk a third bottle, he was
convinced, that not only had the apple spun as it fell, but that the
whole world turned round. If you would prove the centre of gravity
—get drunk.
My son, it is well to drink from your own bottle; but it is still
better to drink from another man's.
“Revenons à nos moutons,” as the wolf said when he went to the sheepfold.
“What do you take me for?" as the pickpocket remarked to the policeman.

THE MEDICAL STUDENTS.
(New Series.)
CHAFTER v.—A FURTHER Account of THE DEBUT OF JACK RAN-
DALL AND M R. SIMPSON BRIGGS IN PUBLIC.
The mansion of melody, before which Jack Randall and his friend
now rested, had the appearance of a small private house which had
come to distress, and was now forced to keep a gin-shop for its sub-
sistence. A flaming placard in the window, whose component letters
were staggering about as if they had taken a little too much, informed
the public that there was a “Concert every Evening”, within, and
two long bills, wafered to the panes of glass, set forth, in attractive
display, the programme of the evening's amusement, the principal
feature being the gladiatorial posturing of the Syrian Indefatigables.
Upon paying a penny each to a dirty fellow who stood at the bar,
soxartining unexpected.
Mr. Simpson Briggs and Jack Randall were allowed to ascend an
exceedingly unsafe staircase to the first floor of the mansion, the
whole of which was appropriated to the “Grand Concert Room.”
The apartment was decorated with tawdry daubings, which on a
minute inspection were discovered to be intended for romantic views
of imaginary localities, where mountains, lakes, ships, Gothic ruins,
Grecian temples, waterfalls, and Swiss cottages, were grouped toge-
ther in magnificent confusion, as if the world had been put into a
kaleidoscope, and tumbled about all ways to see how it would look
perfectly broken to pieces. All the skies were endowed with per-
petual sunset, merging from deep orange into dirt; all the water had
little boats on its surface sailing any way they chose; and the whole
series was mellowed with a chiaro-oscuro of gas and tobacco, which had
a very fine effect, inasmuch as it softened the outlines, and produced
a series of tints which could not be obtained by other means.
A series of rough benches were placed across the room, having
ledges in front on which to stand whatever refreshments the company
chose to indulge in—pipes and porter apparently forming the staple
commodities of the house. The company themselves were rather
numerous than fashionable; but experience has proved that it is im-
possible to command an exclusively aristocratical audience in London
for a penny, and so Jack Randall found them quite as select as he
expected. They took their seats; and ordering a pot of half-and-
half, awaited the commencement of the entertainment; in the inte-
rim reading two placards in the room, one of which conveyed the
following announcement:—
REMEMBER I Don't Fong Et
THE TENTH of DEcEMBER Is THE NIGif r
THE BLoomish URY BRAHAM AND THE LITTLE Wond ER
A STUNNER for A PENNY |
CoME EARLY |
These cabalistical innuendos were as incomprehensible to Randall and
Briggs as they doubtless are to our readers; but the habitués of the
room appeared perfectly to understand the attractions set forth.
Another bill stated that “the Judge and Jury Society met there
every Sunday evening;” the entertainment in question consisting of
mock trials—a species of amusement much relished by the “gents” of
London, the whole of the jokes and humour thereunto attached being
brought down to the most debased standard of animal intellect.
The commencement of the concert was announced by the waiter,
who knocked a wooden hammer against the back of the door; and
then some drapery was pulled up with a clothes line, and discovered
the orchestra—a recess about six feet square, part of it being occu-
pied by an old jingling square piano. At the instrument was seated a
melancholy-looking female, about-five-and forty years old, attired in a
faded shawl and bonnet, of that fashion only to be met with in Drury
Laneon wet evenings. She immediately commenced thumping out some
popular air upon the keys, with an enthusiasm which made Mr. Simp-
son Briggs wonder at the tenacity of the wires; but the piano appeared
to have its spirit broken down by years of long unmitigated suffering,
and now patiently put up with any infliction it encourtored.
“Give your orders, gents,” shouted the waiter at the conclusion of
the “overture;’ “give your orders, gents, and Mr. Lumson will
oblige.”
The announcement was received with much tabular percussion;
and the object of the applause suddenly leapt upon the platform, attired
in a dirty frock coat, dirtier waiscoat, and very dirty shirt indeed.
After some masonic communication with the pianiste, he fell into an
attitude and sang “The White Squall,” throwing such grand expres-
sions into the words “a hocean grave,” that it quite frightened his
auditors. When he had finished, the piano suffered another ten
minutes' torture, and then, after another request from the waiter that
the guests would give their orders, Mr. and Mrs. Simms “obliged’—
the singer of the White Squall descending from the orchestra, and
not at all proud, sitting down amongst some of the company, and,
resuming his pipe, just as if he had been a common mortal.
Mr. Simms was a small man with somewhat the air of a journey-
man glazier without his apron. He had on a pair of faded black
trowsers which had evidently never been made for him, and shady
white Berlin gloves with remarkably long fingers, that would have
rendered the process of picking up a sixpence from the table a task
of extreme perplexity, had he felt inclined to do so. Mrs. Simms had
on an elegant cloak, apparently worn inside-out to look imposing;
and two gaudy silver flowers were stuck in her hair, which had a very
brilliant effect. The lady and gentleman then sang a duet expressive
of the minor annoyances and désagrémens attending the married state;
and they quarrelled so naturally, that Jack Randall agreed with Mr.
Briggs,” the perfection could only have been obtained by long and
unceasing rehearsals at home.”
“What may I offer you to drink, ma'am f" said Jack Randall with
an air of extreme politeness, as the lady concluded. “You must
need some little refreshment after your exertion.”
“I’ll take a draught of your beer, if you please,” replied
Mrs. Simms.
“Certainly,” said Mr. Simpson Briggs, handing the pewter with
much reverence to the lady. Then, turning to her husband, he con-
tinued, “And you, sir—what will you do me the favour to drink
with me?” -
“I thank'ee, sir,” replied Mr. Simms; “I’ll take threepenn'orth of
cold.”
Mr. Simpson Briggs had not the slightest idea what was meant by
the professional gentleman, who, to judge from a perpetual short
inspiration of air through his nose, and slight huskiness in the upper
tones of his voice, had laid in a sufficient quantity of cold already; so
he told him to give his order to the waiter, and he would have the
pleasure of settling the account.
The curtain then fell, to prepare for the exhibition of “The
Gladiators;” and when it rose again, the audience beheld two gentle-
men in long drawers and cotton “jerseys,” with their arms apparently
thrust down the legs of stockings, and their hands and faces chalked
and floured, who were standing in attitudes expressive of animosity.
Then the piano uttered some imposing chords; and one of the
gladiators threw his fist out in defiance towards one of the gas
lamps; and the other appeared to invoke the inmates of the second
floor, first looking uncommonly savage at a crack in the ceiling, and
then knocking his chest three times with his fist, which proceeding
enveloped him in a cloud of white dust—no doubt emblematical of
glory. Then they showed the audience how the ancient Romans
fought—which was, apparently, by standing on their heads, getting
upon one another's shoulders, hanging out at right angles with their
foot round the neck of their adversary, tying themselves into knots, and
various other very remarkable feats, which are certainly not adopted
in the pugilistic encounters of the present day, but which nevertheless
much edified Mr. Simpson Briggs and his friend. They applauded
the performance loudly, and declared it could not be surpassed—
although a gentleman near them in a shiny hat and shirt-sleeves
observed—“They fit a deal better the night as he seed'em afore.”
When this division of the programme concluded, there was a
slight hiatus in the amusements, as the gladiators divested themselves
of their attire, and put on their every-day clothes, which were also
very much after the antique. Taking advantage of a temporary
pause, Jack Randall rose from his seat, and, without saying a word
about his intentions to his companion, thus addressed the company:-
“Ladies and gentlemen—I have the pleasure to inform you that
my esteemed friend on my right—”
“What the devil are you going at t” inquired Mr. Simpson Briggs,
half frightened, as Randall placed his hand upon his shoulder.
“Or-der l’” shouted a voice from the end of the room.
“Hush I'll tell you,” replied Randall. “My esteemed friend on
my right,” he continued, “has commissioned me to inform you, that

he is so delighted with the harmony, he wishes to contribute to it
himself.”
“Jack—hang it !—don't be a fool;” again interrupted Briggs.
“His natural modesty,” persevered Jack Randall, “prevents his
telling you so himself.” And then, looking doubly mysterious, he
added—“You little know who he is.”
At these words most of the people in the room rose from their seats
to peep over one another's shoulders at the illustrious visitor, who,
a starte-case,
knowing that when Jack Randall had once started upon any subject,
you might as soon attempt to stop a mail-train with a turnpike of
barley-sugar, gave himself up for lost, and allowed his friend to go on.
“Nephew of the immortal Rubini,” continued Jack, “by his uncle's
side, he only waits the certain retirement of his gifted relative to
appear at the Opera. In the mean time, he delights his friends; and,
with your permission, the gentleman on my right—Mr. Allen Harrison
Templeton Briggs—will favour us with the celebrated comic song
from the opera of ‘Semiramide, or “The British Worthy;’ and, on
this occasion only, he will sing it with the chill off, and a cinder in it.”
And amidst the vociferous cheers of the company, who anticipated
something immensely grand, Jack Randall seized Mr. Simpson
Briggs by the arm, and literally dragged him into the platform—the
people taking his resistance for the modesty of real talent, and in
consequence redoubling their applause.

MUSIC FOR THE MAD.
SoME ingenious M.D., who wants only the A. between the two letters to
make the addition to his title complete, proposes Music for the Mad as a
cure for insanity. We know that music is said to have charms to soothe
the savage breast; but we should be sorry to trust ourselves among a set
of dangerous maniacs with no other defence than a cornet-à-piston, an
octave flute, or even a trombone; though the last, when pulled out to its
full length, might keep the madmen at a respectful distance. We had
rather be protected by iron bars than trust for our safety to bars of
music ; and if singing were to be recommended, we should instinctively
strike up “Monster, away !” if we found ourselves téte-a-tête with a
lunatic. If Bedlam were to break loose, and an Italian organ-boy were
to be accidentally passing at the time, if we are to believe the advocates
of Music for the Mad, there would be no reason to apprehend anything

* The poet had a curious tendency to make himself out worse than he really was.
From the above stanza it would seem that he had spoken unfeelingly to the boy i
but, from private letters, it would seem to have been quite the other way—at least
in this instance.
** There’s not a cab in London town.”
This beautiful line stood in the original MS. as follows:-
* There’s not a cab in all the town.”
t The poet was a good deal attached to his cat, which was the only living thing:
as he often said afterwards, that he then regretted leaving. At a future period of
his life he formed other more reasonable attachments.

You'll find my offer very good.
Lady, thou need'st not feel subdued,
You'll find a bolt behind the wicket;
There, lady, none can now intrude—
Shall I at once make out the ticket !
Well, well—I’m wrong, as I’m alive 1
But, as you wish, it needs must be :
'Pon honour, I'm advancing five
Where duty bids me lend but three.
Name and address—nay, don't look down;
'Tis only form--don't shilly-shally;
Say anything.—“Well 1 Mary Brown,

WRONGS OF THE STOMACH.
The drudgery of the stomach, like that of the Cinderella of romance, or
the maid-of-all-work of real life, is not only excessive, but vile. The
ostrich, according to the showman (though this Cuvier does not ...}
can digest iron; but marine stores are not adapted to the human gizzará.
You can as well get blood out of a post as chyme out of a pebble; and it is
considered the extreme of folly to mistake chalk for cheese. Time alone
is omnivorous; and by the most venerable old women and cleverest phy-
sicians it is agreed, that there are some things which are good to eat, and
others which are not.
“B'aint the inzide of a pig, now, a good deal like a Christian's f" is a
question often asked, by agricultural gentlemen, of the country surgeon.
This inquiry was, no doubt, suggested by the analogy observable, in respect
of feeding, between the rational creature and the grunter; and certainly
the resemblance between a dish of soup and a bucket of wash is by no
means a very distant one. The hog, however, was intended by Nature for
a §. eater; and that interior resemblance which has caused the
“Christian” to imitate him is rather moral than physical. The brute's
stomach, therefore, cannot complain: but that of man is with reason a
grumbler.
The “wrongs of the stomach,” now about to be deplored, begin in its
very infancy. Instead of being dealt with according to the intention of
Nature, it is consigned, if a stomach of quality, to the care of a nurse,
who wronging, as she does, her own stomach, four times at least, and
probably five or six, a-day, cannot possibly do justice to that of her
suckling... If a plebeian paunch, and thus far more happily circumstanced,
it is still the victim of maternal voracity, which, by unlimited indulgence,
*pon the plea, of weakness, in steaks and stout, inflicts upon it an
immensity of ill.
Green gooseberries, crude pippins, unripe plums, nuts, and wall-fruit ;
hips, haws, sloes, blackberries; lollipops, barley-sugar, hard-bake, elecam-
pane, Spanish licorice ; cold turnip, raw carrot, jam, treacle, and pastry,
are a few of those unwholesome substances, vulgarly termed trash, which,
in the urchin or small-boy state, denominated by the sentimental “life's
early spring,” the stomach has commonly to endure. Oh I how it some-
times aches with these accumulated injuries; and how often, it breaking
down like an ill-used donkey, must ipecacuanha and antimony remove its
galling burden.
Its wrongs during the period of adolescence are manifold and grievous.
Its hours of labour are now lengthened, and it is worse treated than a
factory girl or draper's assistant. At twelve, one, or two o'clock, when
all sober people are in bed, it is often (and this too by medical students,
who ought, one would think, to know better) employed on devilled kidneys,
stewed cheese, or as the waiters say, cheeses,Welsh-rarebits, poached-eggs,

chops and shalots, scalloped oysters, tripe, sausages, and the like rebel-
lious materials, besides being compelled to dispose of stout, half-and-half,
and ale, by the quart, and being finally aggravated into unhealthy
activity by various “goes” of alcohol.
Abernethy, who pleaded the cause of the stomach before “ Punch.”
used to say, that a man was either a fool or a physician at forty. He is
both sometimes—before then and afterwards; but that by the by. The
not inconsiderable section of mankind, whose medical and general know;
ledge are at par, that is to say, below it, at that age, continue to the end
of their days to treat their stomach as formerly—the sapient and medical
few only allowing repose and attention to soothe its declining years.
The insidious way in which the stomach is wronged is enough to pro-
voke one's indignation. It is only by gross bribery and corruption of the
palate that those things are smuggled into it which give it such trouble
and annoyance. It is by the aid of pickles, sauces, condiments, and such
like treacherous helps, º: the work of injustice is achieved. Curries,
fricassees, fricandeaus, haricots, hashes, and so forth, are so many contri-
vances for imposing on the hapless stomach. -
The wrongs which are done the stomach under pretence of physic,
whether by quacks out of the medical profession or in it, are also deeply
to be lamented. How often are calomel, James's powder, and magnesia,
not to mention henbane, foxglove, hemlock, arsenic, and the like nice
and wholesome things, inflicted on the undeserving sufferer! And the
government, for a consideration in the shape of revenue, abandons it,
unprotected, to solar tinctures, universal pills, mirific balsams, cough-
lozenges, and real blessings to mothers. -
The last and most grievous wrong under which the stomach groans is
that of privation or pinching, as perpetrated according to law in the Union:
workhouses throughout the kingdom, where poverty, on a “coarser kind
of food,” is dieted somewhat below the scale of crime. But this is a sub-
ject on which Punch finds it impossible to dilate without both losing his
temper and spoiling his beauty; he will here therefore conclude, hoping
that he may not have invited attention to the manifold wrongs of the
stomach entirely and altogether in vain.
AMPUTATION A LUXURY.
Ir will be seen by the papers, that a man had his legcutoff the other day
without knowing anything about it, he having been, during the operation,
under the influence of Mesmerism. If an individual can have his limbs

cut away in this fashion, and only misses them when he wakes up and
wants to use a leg or an arm, it is high time that animal magnetism should
be cultivated as a branch of Medical Education. We should strongly
recommend that the Animals' Friend Society should take the matter up
and insist on butchers and poulterers being compelled to magnetise bul-
locks, sheep, ducks, geese, and capons, before killing them. The applica-
tion of Mesmerism ought not to be omitted even in the case of an
ordinary flea, if the sufferings of a fellow-creature (and fleas are fellow-
creatures, though they are sometimes very unpleasant fellows) can be
alleviated by the process alluded to before the work of slaughter is
begun upon.

READINGS IN THE NEWSPAPERS.
BY JACOB DRYASDUST, F.S.A.
A PRovincial paper, lately, in giving an account of some public
dinner at Cheltenham, very much astonished me. The fun appears
to have waxed fast and furious indeed, as it informs us “the Duke of
Sussex was then drunk amidst long-continued cheering.” I have a
great hereditary respect for the Royal Family—my taxes are punctu.
ally paid—and my hat is invariably taken off when “God save the
Queen” is played, although on a street organ—still, I cannot consider
this conduct of his Royal Highness as either decorous or praise-
worthy; in fact, it appears to me, he could not have been quietly
drunk ; he could not have sunk under the table in a respectable,
gentlemanly way—there would then have been nothing to attract
attention ; but I fear this “long-continued cheering” must have been
called forth by some uproarious merriment on his part—such as
dancing a hornpipe on a china plate, or crowning himself with a
bottle-stand. And if my good feelings were horrified by this recital,
what must I have experienced when, on reading a little further, I
found that “the Bishops and the rest of the Clergy being drunk, the
Rev. Mr. Holwell returned thanks.” This was really too bad ; and I
was much pleased to see that it elicited no cheering. I am rather
puzzled to guess why the Rev. Mr. Holwell returned thanks because
the Bishops and the rest of the Clergy were drunk—respect towards
his own cloth should have induced him to say nothing about it.
The “appropriate singing,” as the paper terms it, was rather curious.
After the health of the Duchess of Kent had been proposed, Mr.
Maitland sang “A jolly full Bottle ;” and after a similar honour had
been paid to the Bishops and Clergy, he performed “Here's a Health
to all good Lasses.” The Bishops, when fully robed, have certainly
an appearance somewhat similar to that of old women; and this may
account for Mr. Maitland's mistake, especially as he no doubt in-
dulged in the festivities of the day.
We are frequently informed “The Queen, last night, went in state
to the Opera, in six carriages.” I am anxious to know how this
operation is performed, and why she should then require such extra-
ordinary accommodation: but I entertain a dislike to crowds, (having
two very bad corns,) and therefore have never been able to satisfy
myself on this point by ocular inspection. “Bell's Life,” about a
month ago, in giving an account of some race, said “Milo was first,
Cartwheel second, and the other horses were nowhere"—what could
have become of them :
We hear that Cerito danced the Cachuca “like an angel,” a very
useful piece of information, as I was not previously aware (never
having seen angels dance) that they are in the habit of standing on
one toe, and twirling round until their garments have assumed the
shape of an expanded umbrella; it also proves that Gentlemen of the
Press have some knowledge of beings of a higher order than their
own. The “City article,” assures us, “money is a drug in the market,”
“cotton is looking up,” “lead is heavy and won’t go off,” and “there
was little done in sugar.” A morning paper, in mentioning the
late wreck of the convict-ship, said, “it pleased Providence to order
that all, but ten, should be destroyed.”—The Globe contained “an
interesting case of poisoning;” and that affair of Woolley and Briers
was described as “highly romantic.”
The titles adopted by those who write letters to the Newspapers
SECURING A FRIEND IN THE PRESS,
on various subjects, are frequently classical and grand, rather than
appropriate.—“Junius Brutus” lately assured the Times, that the
Marylebone Vestry had committed a shameful job, relative to wood-
paving—“Cato” of Covent Garden, complains indignantly of the
annoyance he experiences in walking down Holywell-street; the
Jews there pertinacicusly insisting that he must have made his
appearance, either for the purpose of buying their old clothes, or
disposing of his own.—“A lover of truth,” sees no reason why the
Public should not be admitted into St. Paul's Cathedral, without
payment of the twopenny fee.—“Fiat Justitia” mentions the gross
inattention of the police, in permitting little boys to trundle hoops in
the streets, and “a Friend to his Country and a Constant Reader,”
inveighs in bitter terms against the proceedings of certain scavengers,
who persist in sweeping the dust and mud to his side of the street,
because he gives them no christmas boxes.
It must gratify the bridegroom's feelings, when he finds his account
of the “Marriage in High Life” “solemnized in the presence of a
numerous assemblage of the bon ton,” and departure of the “happy
couple to spend the honeymoon at their seat, Grove House, Camber-
well,” appearing in the Times, with the unexpected heading of
“Advertisement,”—and still more delightful is it for a modest author
to discover his paragraph, descriptive of the “powerful sensation”
to be created by the forthcoming novel, entitled, “Delicious moments,
or, the Man in the Pastry Cook's Shop ;” its tremendous delineations
of “various celebrated Personages,” and its “erudite and soul-en-
trancing moral vein,” inserted immediately after very similar praises
of “Mechi's Magic Strop,” and followed by a pathetic exhortation to
“Persons about to Marry.”
LIST OF AMUSEMENTS IN THE METROPOLIS.
THE Menagerie at the foot of Waterloo-bridge.—Open, gratuitously,
throughout the year. Feeding time—optional with the proprietor.
Parade of the Police in Scotland-yard.—A limited number of spec-
tators only allowed—the directions to “move on ” being always peremp-
torily given when a mob of more than four are observing the evolutions.
The Piers along the river between London-bridge and Chelsea are open
to promenaders throughout the year. The gayest time for those whose ob-
ject is pleasure will be found to be the time when a vessel arrives and
takes its departure.
The Telescope in Leicester-square.—Open during starlight or moon-
light, throughout the year. The charges are matter of arrangement with
the proprietor; but the Stars are lumped into pennyworths, and the
Great Bear is divided into halfpenny lots, while the Constellations are all
to be viewed for sums proportionate to their importance and magnitude. .
General Post delivery, between nine and ten.—This highly interesting
process goes on simultaneously in all parts of the Metropolis, and is a
favourite amusement with young persons who delight in following the
postman round his district.
Changing of the Sentries in the Park.-This entertainment is repeated
every two hours, and, particularly by juvenile strangers, is much run after.
The Exhibition at the Horse Guards, open throughout the year from ten
till four, is a powerful rival to the Wax Works in Baker-street, and
the former has the advantage of being gratuitous. It consists of two
splendid specimens of cavalry, which are on view at the time already
stated. The only restriction on the public is, that they are expected not
to make grimaces at the “specimens.”
The Telegraph at the Admiralty works occasionally throughout the
year, and no ticket is required to confer the privilege of watching it. It
forms an F. very accurately, and its ingenious attempt to constitute a Z
has now and then been considered highly successful.
There are several miscellaneous amusements in the metropolis, consisting
of music, exhibitions of pictures, libraries, &c., all of which are gratuitous.
Occasional selections of literature, laid out in open umbrellas, are some-
times to be met with opposite St. Clement's Church, and a great deal of
sound political knowledge can be picked up in Holywell-street, where the
Parliamentary Blue Books are open to the public inspection at all hours.
NEWSPAPER EXPRESSES.
OUR daily contemporaries are disputing as to the priority of their re-
spective despatches, but they are not perhaps aware, nor is the public
either, that Punch’s expresses beat anything ever known in the annals of
helter-skelter.
“Our Boy” has the most ample latitude allowed him to spare no expense
in hastening with copy from the various contributors, and on the day of
going to press, he is permitted to incur the outlay of the toll on Waterloo
Bridge, to save the time of going round by Blackfriars or Westminster.
The report of the Lord Mayor's Show in Punch was so tremendously
in anticipation of anything any other journal could have effected, that it
has not even yet appeared entire in the columns of any of our contempo-
raries, who have only made a few extracts from it. On the 9th of Novem-
ber we had a land and water express actually going all day, for we had
made a liberal arrangement with a waterman for the use of his wherry,
and had engaged a cab (by time) so that it might be prepared to start at
any hour to the printing-office.
We do not say this with any desire to boast, but merely to show that we
are not outstripped by any of our contemporaries in zeal to provide infor-
mation, or in lavish liberality to ensure speed in communicating the most
important details.

jasbiomable Intelligentt.
Ms. Smoors and family arrived at Farrance's hotel on Thursda
morning last. They partook of mock-turtle, and instantly started for the
East-in a Blackwall omnibus.
Mr. Jones's new turn-out attracted much attention in the Park on
Sunday. It consisted of an entirely new Chesterfield wrapper, splendidly
emblazoned on the buttons with black silk in a raised pattern, and a velvet
collar of surpassing richness. . It was whispered, in circles likely to be
well informed, that it was one of the nineteen-and-ninepennies.
Mr. Brown has broken up his establishment in Whetstone Park, and
has taken an attic at the W. End for the season. The workmen are
busily employed in alterations, and the whitewasher is expected to be got
out on Monday. The painter will begin on the same afternoon, and Mr.
Brown will move in on the same evening.

“3}untb's" ſortigm Hntelligentt
OUR own Express, in anticipation of the General Postman, brought us
messages and parcels down to the moment at which we write, and we have
also received a telegraphic communication from the cad of a Mile-end
omnibus.
The passage from the Hungerford outskirts to the Charing Cross
frontier has for some time been “blocked up,” but our last advices speak
of its being rapidly “blocked down” with the wooden pavement.
The hitherto isolated town of Walworth is in a state of the greatest ex-
citement in consequence of a regular communication having been com-
menced between that place and Camden Town, over the plains and bridge
of Waterloo. There was a public meeting on the subject at Walworth-
gate, at which the turnpike man presided. He gave letters of safe-conduct
to the enterprising driver, who set out on this hitherto untravelled line of
road, and signals were exchanged at all the side bars—the passport, or
ticket of leave, being in some few instances examined.
Our correspondent at Putney speaks of an expected revolution. The
parish junta had resigned en masse, and a mounted patrol had been tra-
versing the roads in the neighbourhood during the greater part of the
night, but nothing serious had transpired. If the foreman is firm, the
flame may be extinguished.
The news from Chelsea is of the most invigorating character; and
Brompton has gained another signal victory. Chelsea is to paint both
sides of the railings that mark the boundary, and Brompton holds the
fire ladder, as a guarantee that the terms of the arrangement will be lite-
rally complied with. Chelsea is also to repair the Brompton engine,
broken in attending a fire in Chelsea, and the Brompton beadle continues

territory of the latter, and the lodging is to be paid for out of the rates; but
this is likely to create heart-burnings among the inhabitants. The trade in
Chelsea buns is to be thrown open to the Bromptonians, and only five per
cent. is in future to be levied on cockles taken off the coast of Battersea.
THE PEACE WITH CHINA.
OUR contemporaries are in ecstacies (and so are we) about the peace
with China. Several grocers in the Metropolis have ticketed their Rough
Congou and Fine Pearl Hyson with pleasant allusions to the friend-
ship henceforth to exist between the two nations; and, at one establishment,
we have observed that the Mandarin who has been so long stuck in the
window, with a paper in his hand requesting the public to “try the four-
and-nine penny mixed,” has been brought into a more conspicuous posi-
tion, and has now a label round his neck, announcing “a great reduction
in teas,” and the “triumph of British valour. . . .”
The best of the joke is, that tea will be dearer now than it has ever been
before ; for it happens that the Chinese have undertaken to pay 21 millions
of dollars without having a single rap towards it ; and they intend to raise
the money by taxing every pound of tea that is exported from the country.
Thus, what we receive with one hand we shall pay with the other; and

we cannot but admire the cunning of Tao-Kwang in making us liquidate
our own demands out of our own pockets.
It is true that we shall find, in the five ports thrown open to us, a most
delicious outlet for some of our manufactures; that is to say, if we can
The former power is to permit an ambassador to reside in the ,
bully the Celestials into adopting our wants and habits as their own
which—as the usual cry about civilisation has been already got up—will
no doubt be the consequence.
We shall, perhaps, teach them that bald heads and barbarism are
Y| synonymous—a conviction which, if once knocked into them, will give an
impetus to our wig-manufacturers; and if, under the pretext of civi-
lisation, we can compel them to put on bear-skin coats, with sou'-
wester hats, we shall impart a refreshing buoyancy to the slop-market.
We perceive that there is a probability of a live Mandarin coming over
to this country; and if such a thing should occur, we shall not be
astonished to see him underlined at the Adelphi, as engaged at an
enormous expense ; for—at all events, when poor Yates was alive—if the
Emperor himself had come over, the Brother of the Moon would have
been humbugged into allowing himself to appear as a star for “six
nights only.”
Now that the Chinese are doomed to “civilisation,” they may make up
their minds to be bullied, robbed, and swindled in every direction; for, in
the political vocabulary, “to civilise the people of a distant country,” has
a meaning which the treatment of the Indians in North America will give
a º accurate solution of. France has already expressed a wish to
have a hand in the fruits of the “civilisation,” which is a proof that some
very pretty pickings are looked forward to.
MEETINGS OF LEARNED SOCIETIES.
The Geological Society met on Tuesday last for the purpose of breaking
stones on the Hammersmith road. Much dissatisfaction was expressed at
the lowness of the remuneration, 7d. a-day; and as the arguments against
it were chiefly of a physical kind, and as in convincing an obstinate over-
seer they broke the bridge of his nose and the queen's peace, several of
them were lodged in the station-house of the T Division. In the course
of their researches an article was discovered, which the ignorant supposed
to be a pewter quart pot—the initiated, however, declared it to be an
ancient sacrificial vessel used in libations, probably to Bacchus. It has
since been converted by an ingenious workman into silver shillings. It
was whispered that one “Fellow” in a fustian jacket had found some
antique copper coins; whether this report be true we cannot tell, but it
appears probable, as he was fined 5s. on the following morning for drunk-
enness, and a friend, of great experience in such matters, assures us it is
impossible to get comfortably drunk on 7d. a-day.
The Electrical SocIETY met for the purpose of trying a new method
of making thunder and lightning for theatrical use. Mr. Job Swinger de-
livered himself of a long oration on “The Law of Storms,” which was

practically illustrated by his wife, who made her appearance with a broom-
stick to inquire why he staid out so late at night. The meeting was after-
wards electrified with astonishment by their housekeeper, who demanded
her quarter's wages: it was resolved that she should have them—when
she could get them. Some mention was then made about the Court of
Requests, Rights of Englishmen, and Kitchen-stuff. Electrical eel pies
were ultimately partaken of, and some of Whitbread's stout, in order to
trace the galvanic action produced by the contact of the pewter pot with
the moisture of the under lip.
The Astronomical Society went on Tuesday last in a patent safety cab
to the pit of Covent-Garden. Theatre, for the purpose of determining
to what “order of Stars.” Adelaide Kemble and Mrs. Shaw belong. The
meeting was subsequently adjourned to Evans's, but we could not discover
the result of their observations, as the only words we caught were, “Two
goes of whiskey and some mild Havannahs.” We noticed a curious fact—
one of them paid for four pints of porter less than he took ; owing, no
doubt, to the absorbing nature of his meditations.
The Zoological Society met on Wednesday: a paper was read on the
“bears,” “bulls,” and “lame ducks” of the Stock Exchange, their nature
and habits. One member informed the meeting that he had “caught a
Tartar,” and requested to know what he . do with her; on being
pressed to explain, he stated that his landlady had collared his trunk for a
week's rent in arrear, and taken away the street-door key: he was advised
to pay the demand, if possible, and if not, to turn patriot and get an act
passed “to enable nobody to pay nothing to no one, not by no means.”
Some specimens of “orchestral fiddlers,” “soul-entrancing poets,” “nice
young men,” and “noble lords,” were placed among the mammalia, as
studies for future ages.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PEACE WITH THE PIG-TAILS.
Peace has issued with the palm-branch from the gates of Pekin.
The poppy war is ended. There shall again be free commerce in
Souchong, and Opium shall again be hot in the mouth. The war
“bequeathed by the Whigs” to Sir Robert PEEL, returns to the
minister (as Moneau said of Napoleon, “ce coquinest toujours heureur,”)
a very handsome profit on the ball and powder expended in this great
moral lesson on the uneducated Chinese. For once, Victory besides
the laurels round her brows, has a balance of ready money (when
paid) in her pocket. As for the loss of life on the part of our gallant
forces, we believe the whole amount of the casualties of the war will
be found correctly stated below:
From over perspiration in pursuit of the enemy
From a supper of unripe cucumbers - -
From want of "bacco - - - -
Desertion with a daughter of a mandarin
1 full private.
1 drummer.
l boatswain's mate.
1 midshipman.
Total loss . . - - - ... 4
We do not think that even the Poor Law Commissioners, with all
their extravagant valuation of the specimens of the genus homo, will
consider the country not sufficiently remunerated by the Chinese for
the loss of these poor men, when all other expenses incidental to the
altercation shall have been duly settled. As for the powder and
ball, the Chinese cannot contend that they have not received them,
and as honest men (and beaten barbarians) are bound to pay for the
goods accordingly.
However, in our vaingloriousness, let us not attribute to the pusil-
lanimity of the Emperor of China what, in the spirit of truth, should
be allowed to his philanthropy. The Emperor gives his three years'
promissory word for the payment of 21 millions of dollars. Our
correspondent at Pekin favours us with what he pledges himself to
be the true imperial cause of this munificence. The Emperor has at
his heart a great admiration of the English. The groans of the
Income Tax have been heard on the other side of the Great Wall;
hence, our Pekin friend (he is the same gentleman who supplies The
Obserrer with its Theatrical Intelligence) informs us that the Treaty of
Peace was accompanied with a private note to Sir Robert PEEL as-
suring him that the dollars were wrung from the imperial chest by a
strong compassion for the condition of Englishmen generally, coupled
with a hope that the large surplus would be conscientiously devoted
to the alleviation of their misery. Of course, it is in the breast of Sir
Rohent to confess or deny this, as by office allowed. We are,
however, prepared to champion the veracity of our correspondent,
who, in continuation, says—“This note is written with the vermilion
pencil, and dignified with the usual imperial postscript—‘A special
edict: respect this?’” At present we shall say no more. If, how-
ever, Colonel Sibthorp put any question to Sir Rob ERT on the open-
ing of Parliament, the reader may know who the interrogative
comes from.
The dollars, however, are a minor advantage. John Bull, having
expended so much powder and ball, and applied so much cold iron,
to the Chinese, is in future to be treated like a gentleman. He
has washed out the “barbarian” in the blood of two or three
thousand bipeds, and is henceforth to be recognised as a pretty
fellow. Chinese bowels, touched by English bayonets, relent from
their arrogance, and acknowledge the bowels of the British as of
equal kidney. We are to have no more of the “barbarian eye”—such
eyes being for ever knocked out of the Chinese vocabulary. How
grateful to teach the verbal courtesies of life by “the adamantine
lips” of forty-two pounders Thus, considering war as the handmaid
of politeness, we hope the time will come when our gallant marines
employed on foreign service will be only known as “the Schoolmas-
ters abroad,” and the “Rocket Brigade” give place to the “Chester-
field Rangers "
Besides the dollars and the civility, we are to have five Chinese
ports open to English commerce. Politicians and bagmen may exult
at this, and in the anticipative eye of profit, already see the Emperor
of China clothed in a Manchester shirt, all his wives in Manchester
cotton, and the whole of his court handling Sheffield knives and
forks, to the lasting disgrace of the time-honoured chopstick. The
arithmetical spirit of commerce may rejoice, but the gold-buttoned
Tories of China must howl and mourn; the mystery of China is
broken-destroyed like one of China's tea-cups. For ages has she
been to the rest of the world as a magic lantern, fitfully revealing
strange, uncouth things, to staring nations, and then with a presto
shrouding herself in the mystery of darkness. Barbarians have now
been behind the curtain, and handled the slides. -
What we are pleased to call the future civilization of China, has
been prophesied from various and opposite causes. Mons. Dr. LAMAR-
TINE thought the first click of English percussion-caps might be the
preludizing note of hope to the Celestial Empire; in a late letter
from an English surgeon, we are afforded other joyful anticipations.
The British Leech notices, with much self-complacency, certain suc-
cessful cases of amputation suffered by Chinese prisoners; who, when
first submitted to the knife of the operator, believed that he was the
executioner sent to torture them; but whose better opinions ad-
vanced with their bodily cures, and who finally held up their stumps
in admiration of British humanity. “These men returned to their
houses,” says the surgeon, rejoicingly, “must have their moral influ-
ence " Thus, English civilization may travel through China upon a
wooden leg.
England, however, may not be alone in the goodly work. France
already cries for five harbours of commerce—she is already loud
for her Cinque Ports in the Chinese waters. “If England have five,
why not we ?” asks the French press. Now, as this is a matter quite
between Louis-Philippe and the brother of the man in the moon, we
must leave them to settle it. We may just remark, that “perfidious
Albion” does not monopolize all the gunpowder and iron in the
world: if France want five, or even fifty ports, she has only to do as
we have done—quarrel, fight, and get them.
The island of Hongkong is for ever ceded to the British crown.
Already different parties have been named in the various club-houses
as the future governor. We can, however, upon authority state, that
the office has not yet been offered to Lord FRANKront (whose in-
valuable Chinese snuff-boxes gave him, it was thought, a peculiar
claim to the post); but that Lord ChEstERFIELD has, in the hand-
somest manner, offered to become trustee for the receipt of the
twenty-one millions. Should his lordship's offer be accepted, we will
publish the intelligence in a second edition. -
THE POLICE AND THEIR WHISKERS.
A considerABLE sensation has been created amongst the Metropolitan
Police, by a general order on the subject of whiskers. Various conjectures
have been hazarded as to the cause for the resolution which has been come
to by the Commissioners, and several of the force have revolted against a
measure involving the loss of that which they emphatically declare to be
dearer than life—their personability. , Considering that the greater part
of a policeman's occupation when on duty is to ogle the servant-girls, it is
equivalent to a downright disqualification, to call upon them to sacrifice
all that many of them have to depend upon for success in that particular
branch of their profession which we have just now alluded to. “If we
are to be disfigured,” say some of them, “let the figures be taken from
our collars, but let not the disfiguring process be put in practice upon
our visages.”
§. been the panic in the force that the Commissioners have been
induced to reconsider the matter, and a return of the state of the whisker
crops throughout the Metropolitan Police has been ordered. It would
seem that five in twenty have sandy whiskers; two in forty have none at
all ; one in ninety is sure to cut himself whenever he shaves; and three
in thirty have their whiskers almost meeting under their noses. It is
expected that there will be a modification of the recent order, and that
six square inches of whisker will in future be allowed to every member
of the Police force. A public meeting of the body has been called, and the
chair is to be taken by A.l., who has shown considerable spirit in resisting
the order, and is cultivating mustachios under the very nose—not of him-
self alone—but the Commissioners.
On the 1st of December was presented, for the pence and praise of
the universe,
Punch’s Pocket-Book for 1843 .
WITH UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED ILLUSTRATIONS,
Forming an elegant little volume equally adapted for the reticule
of the Sovereign and the pocket of the Lord Mayor.
Punch's Almanack for 1843
Will be ready to set the world in a ferment on Decemn ER 31st.
WE make the announcement, that everybody in existence may an-
ticipate a Happy New Year without any fear of disappointment.

PUNCHPS LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LeTTeR xx.-ON. The Philosophy of GAMING.
MY DEAR Son—You will, I trust, after these many fond and anxious
epistles, look upon all men as divided into two classes—the men who
eat men, and the men who are eaten. With this conviction, it will,
I hope, be your determination always to obtain a good, sufficing
belly-full of your fellow-creatures; and never to contribute in your
own person a single mouthful to the banquet of the anthropophagi.
It is a vulgar mistake, the very crassitude of ignorance, to look
upon only those men as man-eaters, who despatch their victims with
a club or tomahawk, and lighting the festive fire, make their own
maw an honourable tomb for their enemies. This mode of eating
only distinguishes the savage from his more refined brother, who
disguises and sophisticates his cookery, and by the aid of certain
social sauce, makes even himself forgetful of the horror which—to use
the cook's phrase—is the stock of the feast.
In your boyhood, you were, I know, a most active taker of bird's
nests. It was your delight to possess yourself of the eggs, ere the
process of incubation had commenced, and having very tenderly
sucked out the contents, you would thread the mere shell on a piece
of grass, as a trophy of your adroitness and good fortune. My dear boy,
it is quite possible—indeed, it is every day accomplished—to treat
the substance of men, as you have treated the eggs of larks and
sparrows. How many successful egg-suckers could I point out to you,
who applying the thousand means with which law and social
chicanery supply every man, wise and adroit enough to use them,-
have so sucked and sucked, that they have left nothing but the mere
outside—the fragile shells of men . There is my old acquaintance,
Barabbas Moses, with his sixty in a hundred. Twenty years ago he
lived by putting off pencils, with apocryphal lead in them. How has
he grown thus rich—how has he become thus treble-gilt My son,
he has been a most enterprising egg-sucker. IIow many birds of fine
feather has he destroyed in the egg—how many shells of men might
he wear about him . It is a poor thing to scalp a man; a coarse,
rough operation : but to feast upon his vitals, nay, to abstract his
very marrow from him, to leave no blood-mark there, yet leave him
with sufficient vitality to crawl about and look like a man—that, my
son, is the master-piece of civilization, the genius of refined life.
There is, however, a more open—a more generous mode of living
upon men; a mode, dignified by fashion, exalted by authority—I
mean gaming.
The gamester is, indeed, a privileged person; a creature, who
merges all the petty, wearying anxieties of life into one sublime pas-
sion. Become a gamester, and you are fortified, nay, exempt froln
the assaults of divers other feelings that distract and worry less
happy men. Gaming is a moral Aaron's rod, and swallows up all
meaner passions.
Consider, my son, the vigilance, the self-concentration, the judg-
ment, the quickness of wit, and at times, the dexterity of finger,
necessary to a successful gamester; and you will look upon the
character with still-increasing veneration. Did you ever know a
gamester fall madly in love 1 Did you ever know him, if a married
man, waste his profitable time, his profitable thoughts, upon the woman
he has buckled himself to ? If he be a father, what is the laughter of
his children to the melody of the dice What human hearts to the
ace and king of the same suit, when trumps ? He is exalted far
above the weakening influences that pull down other men, and from
his elevation looks with a cold eye of dignity upon the pettiness
of human affections. You will hear other men rave about the
beauties of nature; of hill and dale, mountain and flood. To the
gamester, how small the space that bounds his imagination—but then
how rich, how fertile—those half-dozen yards of bright green cloth !
You will hear men talk about the sweets of industry; of the
dignity of labour; the more especially those men who never yet set
their foot to a spade, or their hand to a plough. The sweets of
industry! what are they to the sweets of fortune? And for the dig-
nity of labour, give me, say I, the dignity of luck!
Observe what is called the industrious man. Mark his daily mar-
tyrdom. He rises early ; breakfasts lightly; hurries off with his
bread-and-butter yet undigested to his labour. He toils his eight,
ten, nay twelve hours; comes home; eats his crust; and with hardly
strength remaining to take off his stockings, slinks wearied to bed.
In a brief time—how very brief!—the cock crows, and the industrious
man has serious thoughts of shaving; again he is up—again has he
bolted his morning meal,—and again is he out to go over the
drudgery of how many thousand yesterdays . The year's wound up;
and for all this toil, this anxiety, this daily crucifixion of spirit, the
industrious man counts one—two—shall we say three hundred golden
pieces? For all this tedious misery—three hundred pounds !
My son, turn your eyes to the gamester. He rises when he likes
—dallies, at “his own sweet will,” with his breakfast. He then
lounges away the hours, pleasantly meditating on the coming night.
He enters the arena. With what a graceful assurance doth he take
the box in his hand. One—two—three : he throws sixes, and pockets
five hundred pounds ! What a miserable, felon, outcast sneak-up
does your industrious man appear after this What a poor, sweating
slave Whilst on the other hand, what an air of power is about the
gamester What a glory—what a magic . He inherits, in one
minute by the potent shake of his elbow, all that poor, sordid, labour
wears its back into a hoop for—its eyes into blindness | Will you,
after this, ever dream of becoming that miserable negative—an
industrious man Depend upon it the true jewels of life—rightly
worn—are the four aces. Hope has been vulgarly pictured with an
anchor. Let your hope carry a dice-box
As for luck, you may nearly always ensure that, if you properly
educate your perceptions, and your fingers. Cultivate your thumb-
nails, my dear boy; the smallest sacrifice to the personal graces is not
lost upon the gamester.
But I will take the worst side of the picture. You are doomed
to be unlucky—you are fated always to lose. You have no genius
—like the genius of Socrates, that always popped into its master's
hand the very trump required, to aid and abet you. The world
turns its back on you; and neither by cards nor dice can you fob
your brother mortal out of a single guinea. Debts come in like the
waves about you : you have no home—no abiding-place l. This is
the moment, my son, for you to exercise the most heroic of virtues.
There is cord—there is steel—there are silver rivers. If you cannot
live, you can die; and dying, you will have this consolation: if you
have steadily and inexorably vindicated the character of a gamester,
your death will inflict no pang upon a single creature left behind
you; and you will have the pleasing consolation to reflect that you
have never done the world a greater service than when you
quitted it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DELICATE HINT.
TMR. Purch occasionally reads the weekly papers. Among the
literary intelligence, he observes that there is always a list, and gene-
rally a long one, of “Books received for review.” Now he begs to
say, that he has hitherto received no books for review, and he would
very much like to know why? He will be most happy to review any
works that may be sent him, if they are worth reviewing—that is
to say worth having ; if otherwise, he will let them alone, and not, as
too many of his contemporaries do, inflict upon them disguised satire
in the shape of unmerited praise. If they are absolutely bad, he
will quietly light his cigars with them. The kind of books that Mr.
Punch feels himself best qualified to criticise, are really interesting
novels, useful scientific publications, important works on China, Egypt,
and other remarkable nations, and on Natural History and Architec-
ture, magnificently got up and illustrated. It may appear singular;
but the circumstance of their being handsomely bound will heighten
his appreciation of them amazingly.
In his perambulations through the streets, Mr. Punch is continu-
ally struck with the beautiful prints and engravings which he observes
in the windows. Be it known, though he says it that should not,
that his taste in art is admirable; how is it, therefore, that he never
sees any of these pictorial novelties at his office & Neither the Queen,
nor Prince Albert, nor the Royal Infants, nor views in Affghanistan,
nor Nash's Interiors, nor Morrison's Haddon Hall, nor Hunt's nor
Tayler's latest gems, nor those of Cattermole, nor Edwin Landseer's
last litter, has he ever beheld upon his counter. Mr. Moon, Messieurs
Hodson and Graves, what are you thinking of
Mr. PUNch has now before him a double “Times;” one half of it
consisting of advertisements. Now it is in his power to give immense
publicity to any thing if he pleases: and there are various articles of
utility and of luxury, which, if enabled to pronounce upon them, he
will be delighted to celebrate for nothing. Why not let him try
*Tallyho Sauce” and “Potted Yarmouth Bloaters;” why not secure
his advocacy of Tailor's-Bills-Reform by making him a first rate suit
of clothes He will have no objection to attend in the office an hour
every day, to be measured. He is allowed by his friends to be a capi-
tal judge of wine, and would gladly enhance with his suffrages the value
of a stock of Champagne, Burgundy, or Claret, or even of Port or
Sherry, were a few bottles of it sent him to taste. He is an excellent
hand at choosing furniture; now it would be much better than send-
ing a car about town, plastered all over with recommendations to go
to this place or that when you marry, to make him a present of a little
bedding, a few tables and chairs, and a looking-glass or so, of which
his description should be as graphic as his acknowledgments would
be grateful. . Mr. Punch is astonished that no one has ever thought
of thus seeking notoriety through him. He is a connoisseur in boots;
but, will it be believed the Pannuscorium people next door to him
have never once so much as sent in to ask if he were troubled with
cutting A TRoublesomr Acquaint Ancr.
corns, and if so, whether he would condescend to make trial of their
invention 1
It is a peculiar feature in the character of Mr. Punch, that he has
an intense relish for everything that is good. He will therefore wil-
lingly permit tea, coffee, sugar, tobacco, nay, vinegar and pepper;
whatever, in short, is excellent in its way, to be submitted to his cri-
tical inspection. His connexions are so extensive, that he hopes no
fear lest he should not know what to do with such or such articles,
will cause any sort of property to be withheld from him. He will
find plenty of uses for any one’s “elegancies;” for spoons, watches,
plate, crockery, stove-ranges, fire-irons, dust-pans, kettles, or scrub-
bing-brushes; in fine, to him, as some illustrious author says, or might
have said, of somebody—“Omne piscis est quod renit ad rete.” If he find
his present advice likely to be followed, he promises the public that
he will take a warehouse; and that there may be no mistake in any
quarter as to his capacity for goods, he begs it to be understood that
he is decidedly open to marine stores.
An idea has suddenly occurred to Mr. Punch, which he sincerely
hopes may be incorrect; but the surest way to find whether it is or
is not, will be to state it. His idea is this.-He questions very much
whether there is not something in the old proverb, “Great Cry, and
Little Wool,” and whether the majority of your advertising gentry
are not, in a slight measure, humbugs, of whose wares a conscientious
individual like himself, would be unable to speak in praise. If he is
out in this conjecture, let them refute it by adopting his suggestion.
BALLADS OF THE BOYS,
No. III.--THE POT-BOY.
They tell me childhood's happy prime
Is of our lives the sweetest time;
They say it but my heart to cheer.
Alas! I cannot deem it truth,
While thus I pass my early youth
In carrying out and shouting—“Beer!”
No more upon the cheerful green
('Tis Newington, of course, I mean)
- Can I in bat or ball delight ;
For I must go the beer to leave,
From silent morn till dewy eve,
And then again till dusky night.
My young companions cluster round,
And often mock the mournful sound
I utter on my cheerless way.
How oft my heart—like pots fill'd up—
Brims o'er with woe's too bitter cup ;
I could not, if I would, be gay.
NAVAL PROMotion.
If as I take my walks abroad,
A moment I to play afford,
On some too fondly cherished spots,
The effort to be glad is vain;
For on my young bewilder'd brain
There bursts the gloomy cry of—“Pots!”
Then up my leather strap I take—
I hate the noise the measures make,
As jingling at my back they hang;
For 1 was born to better things,
Like the young man who comes and sings
Upstairs each night with nasal twang.
Complaint, alas! is idle now ;
To destiny I needs must bow,
For sorrow is the mortal's lot.
It was the fate of man to fall ;
And, like myself, they'll one day all—
• Somehow or other—go to pot.
3Foreign #ntelligente.
We are entirely destitute of papers from every quarter, and we are
consequently left to our own speculations. The Punjaub is in a fearful state,
and Shah Soojah has declared himself independent of everything. Akbhar
Khan is desperate, and Ibrahim Pacha is suffering from elephantiasis in
his left eyebrow. If this causes him to take a different view of matters
in the East, his indisposition will have been productive of lasting benefit.
Dost Mahomed, through the influence of Deen Mahomed, is to have the
order of the Bath; and the mess into which the Indians are thrown gives
every hope of pickles from that quarter.
Our arrivals from America bring us nothing but a dishonoured bill,
which we have placed in the hands of our attorney. It speaks of a total
want of orders.
“It's only once a-year,” as the Queen said to Dr. Locock.
“With all thy faults I love thee still,” as the alderman said to the decayed Chester.
“Your goodness overpowers me," as the gentleman murmured to the champagne,
when he couldn't rise from his chair.

“THE MARTYRS OF SCIENCE | *
A few months ago SiR DAvid BREwsTER produced a book bearing this
thrilling title. If the work be out of print, and Sir DAvid contemplate a
new edition, there is a species of martyr abounding at the present time in
London, which claims admission to the volume. We really have greater
compassion for “the Infant Thalia” at the Adelaide Gallery of Science,
think of the science of “the Highland Fling !”) than for Galileo
umane reader, contemplate for five minutes the surpassing impudence of
these scientific men. They open a gallery to show the marvels of elec-
tricity, galvinism, sodas, alkalis, pneumatics, &c., &c. Well and good.
People went and were set up scientific for life, at the small cost of one
shilling. Their minds were enlarged by mice gasping in air-pumps—they
felt their divinity “stir within them” from the shock of the electric eel.
These things, however, grew flat and dull, and Science—“star-eyed maid”
indeed—went to some poor man's cradle to seek some supplementary
wonder Science was successful, and lo! we have “the Infant Thalia” to
recommend by a “jockey's hornpipe” and “Highland fling” the dis-
coveries of Newton, and DAvy. Wise, philanthropic John BuLL likes to
drink at the stream of science, but then the old ass must have his draught
sweetened with some such quack compound as “that wonderful little
creature, the Infant Thalia 1" Poor minnikin—hapless “martyr to
science! ”

And no exact direction had he given ;
The vehicle was enter'd in despair—

* He'd only bargain’d for a shilling fare. |
The poet has here sacrificed truth to poetry, for, by private letters to his mother,
it would seem that the fare was at least a one-and-eightpenny. In the original
M.S. the line stood
He bargain'd for a one-and-eightpence fare,
which had been subsequently corrected to
He bargain'd for a twenty-penny fare:
but the line as it now stands was eventually adopted.
+ What beauties does High Holborn first unfold 1–
This line is a close imitation of that in Byron, only that the word “Lisboa” in
Childe Harold is High Holborn in Child Snobson. Whether the Child ever thought of
going to Lisboa, cannot now be ascertained; but it is clear that iſ he did, he altered
his determination, and proceeded to High Holborn in the first instance. On the
principle that the way to Oxfordshire is down Tooley-street, it may be said that the
way to Lisbon is along High Holborn.—Scott.
t Thc Fleet with the Queen's Bench is now incorporated.
The poet was frequently in the Fleet, whither he was often taken at his own
request by habeas. There are letters to his mother now in existence, dated from the
Fleet, wherein he requests her to perform certain pecuniary operations with a view
to his release; but we find nothing relating to this point of his career, except in the
archives of the Insolvent Court. In these the name of Snobson occurs rather

And e'en the boldest spirit could but wait
Till his discharge was lodged, in due form, at the gate.
A “CHESTERFIELD" FRAGMENT.
It is well known that that speckless peer, Philip Dormer, Earl of
Chesterfield, wrote sundry letters to his illegitimate son, with the paternal
intention of making him a most polished rascal. We believe the Earl
was not very successful in his purpose, the offspring of his loins turning
out more fool than knave. It was imagined that all the Earl's epistles
had been given to a thankful generation. Within the last few days, how-
ever, the subjoined fragment of a hitherto unpublished Letter (duly
attested) has been brought to our Office ; and as at the present moment
it may be read with some interest, we hesitate not to print it. His lord-
ship's notions of the dignity of the female character were somewhat lax,
even for a peer. He writes —
“ - * * * * * * Women you are to consider as mere goods
and chattels; toys and trinkets which, purchased for the hour, are to be
cast aside when the hour shall be passed. The ignorance of women is
extraordinary : they absolutely know nothing of the laws of this happy
country, and are therefore altogether at the mercy of the better educated
sex. #. your friend may be desirous of purchasing some foolish, weak,
unprotected girl. In such a matter your friend has every claim upon
your best services. You may then suggest the settlement of a legacy on
the wench as the price of her honesty; and, more, to give a solemnity to
the bargain, may offer yourself as trustee for due payment of the same.
Sir Pandarus of Troy would not have offered less. Well, the simple girl
closes with the offer, and is gulled. Your friend refuses to pay the
annuity, and you, from your knowledge of the law, are aware that the
victim has no redress, the law sanctifying no immoral obligation. The

for the architectural beauties of the place, and its massive solidity seems to be
entirely thrown away upon them. For my own part, I never look at the splendid
brickwork without a melancholy and sentimental feeling, which I can scarcely
account for.”

CHAPTER VI.-THE CONCLUSION OF THE CONCERT.
OW, Ladies and Gentlemen, but es-
pecially the Ladies, said Jack Ran-
dall, as he dragged Mr. Briggs to the
front of the stage, with the air of a
manager, leading forward a débutant,
who exhibits the pantomimic reluc-
tance at the prompt side of the pro-
scenium usual upon such occasions—
“My friend, Mr. Allen Harrison Tem-
Spleton Briggs, has every song at his
command that was ever known, and
º sº he wishes you to name your favourite
-
º § one.”
*E= There was an instant of silence after
this announcement, no one liking to
- - - make the first choice. But presently
the gentleman in the shiny hat, and shirt-sleeves, begged Briggs
would oblige the company with “Spare that 'ere tree.” This encour-
aged others to solicit their favourite ballads; and the whole audi-
ence began simultaneously to call out for the songs they most
wished to hear, which included “Halice Gray,” “The Single Young
Man Lodger,” “My Art's in the Islands,” and “Hot Codlins;” but
the popular desire was certainly in favour of a lyrical effusion which
appeared very well known to the frequenters of the concert under
the title of “Q crikey! don't I love my mother " a burst of natural
affection, which in point of intensity could be equalled but by few
ballad writers of the present day.
During this period Mr. Simpson Briggs had been apparently enact-
ing the struggles of “The Gladiators” over again with Jack ſtandall,

cious friend. But Jack had seized hold of his collar with the clutch
of a cast-iron policeman, and, taking advantage of the violent strug-
gles of Mr. Briggs, turned it to account by calling out,
“Imitation of Messrs. Blanchard and Ellsgood in the drunken com-
bat of the Dumb Girl of Genoa.”
This speech he followed up by springing and stamping about in the
most approved melodramatic style, nevertheless keeping a firm hold
of his friend. The elderly female at the piano, imagining that it was
all intended, began to play some of the same wild chords with which
she was wont to accompany the evolutions of the Syrian Indefatiga-
bles; and at the same time the company, taking it all for granted,
came down with thunders of approbation, which increased as Mr.
Briggs became more and more energetic in his efforts to get loose.
At last he collected all his force, and with a violent spring broke
away from Randall, and tumbled off the platform, coming down all
in a heap upon the nearest table, which fortunately had only pewter
pots upon it, or the damage would have been most extensive. An-
other cheer greeted this feat, which was also supposed to be part of
the performance by the spectators; and then, as a concluding hit,
Jack threw himself into a posture of triumph, and informed the
company it was a representation of “Achilles slaying the learned
Hygeist,” being the first words that came uppermost, and having a
relation in sound if not in sense, with the name of some statue he
had seen on the terrace-garden at Windsor Castle.
“What a fool you are, Jack,” was the salutation with which Mr.
Briggs greeted his companion, as Randall, having bowed to the au-
dience, stepped from the platform, and resumed his seat.
“Hush hold your tongue,” replied Jack. “Great lark—immense
—they think it was all meant.”
“Song song song " cried many voices from different parts of
the room.
“Here—they insist upon your singing,” said Jack, sotto roce, to
Mr. Briggs.
“Oh—nonsense you know I can’t.
life.”
“All right, sir. I'll make an apology, and sing one myself.”
Whereupon Jack Randall rose, and, turning to the company, in-
formed them “that the exertions of his friend had somewhat disa-
bled him from complying with their request, but that, with their
permission he would attempt, though he was

to contribute to the convivial harmony of the evening.”
Fresh applause followed his speech; the audience did not appear
particularly to care who the song came from, provided they got one ;
and Jack Randall, with all the assurance in the world, once more
ascended the platform. He understood enough of music, to be able
to get through a trifling piano accompaniment, and having requested
“The pianist,” with much politeness, to vacate her seat in his favour,
he took his place at the instrument. There was a little confusion
created at first starting off, by the leg of the music-stool getting into
a hole in the floor, that had been made for the insertion of a post
when the wonderful man-monkey exhibited his supernatural perform-
ances, which the bill stated, “placed him at once on an equality with
the animal creation.” This little accident was awkward, inasmuch
as it shot Jack Randall off his perch : but immediately recovering,
he favoured the company with a ballad which alluded to a young
lady passing through the different stages of maid, wife, and widow,
under the various head-dresses of a wreath of roses, orange flowers,
and weeds; and proving the keen observation of Jack Randall, who
made very minute remarks on her appearance, although he confessed
that he saw her but a moment: “but,” added he, looking at a dirty
piece of music before him, upon which some vivacious predecessor
had drawn a lady's profile, taking a sight, “methinks I see her now.”
Had Jack Randall been ambitious, the reception which the song
met with, from all except the regularly engaged professionals, would
have incited him to further displays of his musical and vocal
talent. But recollecting the grand secret of success in life, to
retire when you have made a good impression, he acknowledged
the plaudits of the company by a very magnificent bow, and having
requested they would do him the favour to drink his health in a gallon

of half-and-half, which he would settle for with the waiter, he resumed
his seat.
“I ask your pardon, Sir,” said a very cadaverous-looking man,
approaching him; “I ask your pardon, Sir, but my benefit is fixed
for the tenth of December. I am the Bloomsbury Braham, what is
mentioned in the bill. If you would give me a song, you would
greatly oblige me.”
“Oh certainly, certainly,” replied Jack. “Two or three, any songs,
all sorts of songs—comic, Italian, or mentisental.” Then raising his
voice he added, to the room in general:—
“Ladies and Gentlemen,
“The hour is come that we must part ; but the remembrance of the
whilst memory holds her seat in my brain's parliament. In the name
of my friend, Mr. Allen Harrison Templeton Briggs, whom you have
have not heard to-night, but who trusts on some future opportunity,
not far distant, to have the pleasure of again contributing to your
enjoyment, we respectfully bid you farewell.”
And amidst a storm of concussions, in which the tables suffered
considerably from the bottoms of the pewter pots, the two students
left the room, and sallied out once more into the open air.
The theatres were just over, and all was noise and confusion
amongst the carriages assembled, except the vehicles at the private
box entrance of Drury Lane, whose drivers and footmen had been
quietly sleeping on their boxes for the last hour and a half, and
required nothing less than an actual personal insult to arouse them.
As soon as they had passed the stage door, and the usual crowd of
loungers about it, friends of the drum, cousins of the thunder, and
convivial acquaintances of the first citizen and second peasant, Jack
quietly informed Mr. Briggs “ that it was his intention to arouse the
ire of the John Thomases.”
From a keen observance of human nature, Jack Randall had
observed, in his nightly perambulations, that when coachmen go to
sleep upon their box, which is the invariable result of waiting above ||
twenty minutes in the open air, they always let their whip drop upon
their left arm, towards the near side of the carriage, and supported
in a measure by the knees of the footmen, who are snoring at their
side. Jack consequently found the thongs of all the whips belonging
to the coachmen of the company in the private boxes, hanging over
the pavement, like so many fishing lines. So he tugged down every
one that came in his way, with a sudden jerk, and then let it fly back
again, startling the coachman from his slumbers, with the general
accompaniment of a flick in the face from the thong, as the lash
recoiled. By the time he was awake, Jack and Mr. Briggs had
walked on to another carriage, and this facetious amusement was
repeated until the whole line was in a state of great excitement,
trying to catch him with the lash of their whips—which intended
punishment always fell upon the next passer-by-or saluting him
with such jocular speeches as “There goes two tailors " “Halloo!
you counter-jumpers, here's your master a coming ;” or “Are you
out for the night f" to which last inquiry Jack generally replied that
he was, with the key, and that his mother didn't know it.
AN Arch Frillow.
After a few more practical jokes, at the expense of the ham-
sandwich men, and the vendors of “Frrrruit-pie orrrr-ra meat ſ’’ for
gallery consumption, Mr. Briggs avowed his intention of going home,
because, as we have stated, his landlady was religiously rheumatic,
and did not like Medical Students or late lodgers. And Jack Randall,
who could not get to sleep if he went to bed before three in the
morning, wandered into the parlours of various taverns, to see if he
could find some acquaintances in any of them to sup with, concluding
his evening in a most unexpected manner, to which, in all probability,
we may hereafter refer.
* Eſcu can't pass here,” as Poet's Corner said to Thorwaldsen's statue of Lord Byron.
A “TRIED". COMPANY.
The extraordinary patronage awarded by an intelligent public to
that rose-bud of the Old Bailey, Miss Alice Lowe, has induced a
spirited and enterprising manager to engage, at an “enormous ex-
pense,” a whole company of actors and actresses possessing, in a
peculiar degree, those elements of popularity which have been found
so intense in their application in the case of the Maid of Frankfort.
At present, we are not permitted to give the name of the manager,
who has thus devoted his whole fortune (one wig, a hare's-foot, and
- - - a cake of vermilion) to the advancement of public taste; we, however,
happy evening we have passed together, will never be eradicated
break no faith in enumerating a few of the company, who will
shortly make good their claims to the applauses of the town :-
MR. Covex Buak’EM. This gentleman is engaged for the heroes
of melo-drama, and brings peculiar advanta-
ges to the task, having been arraigned
at York Assizes for a desperate highway-
robbery; he was, however, happily saved by a
flaw, being indicted as Cory; that is, without
the e.
A tenor voice, of extraordinary sweetness.
Indicted at Croydon on a charge of pot-steal-
ing; but discharged, no witness appearing
against him.
MR. Jonathan DE WILD. A low comedian of great versatility.
Stood in the pillory once at Wakefield, for
an imputed case of perjury. Irresistible in a
comic song.
Excellent in the old men. Of great pro-
vincial celebrity, having been tried in three
separate counties for child-stealing, and prov-
ing in each case a triumphant alibi. Inimit-
able in the pathetic fathers.
Ma. HENRY PADDINgtoN. Very genteel as the walking-gentleman.
Once privately whipped for stealing a baby's
necklace.
MR. BINNAcLE BLAckflag. Great in the sailors. Was tried upon
a charge of murder and piracy on the high-
seas, but received the “benefit of the doubt.”
on the part of the jury. Hornpipe wonderful;
rocking-step and double-shuffle not to be
surpassed.
Miss Virginia Diver. This young lady is expected to be really
“the acknowledged heroine of domestic
drama,” from her intimate acquaintance with
every station-house in London. IIer first
benefit will be under the patronage of the
new police. Was once put on her trial for
picking the pocket of a bishop at Exeter Hall,
who declined to prosecute.
Miss Lydia Slam Menxi N. (Late of Fleet-street.) This lady plays
first comedy; and if her own defence at the
Old Bailey, on a charge of pawning her land-
lady's counterpane may be received as any
evidence of her wit and vivacity, her stage
powers will be astonishing.
Mns. Alicia SELLMAID. An admirable representative of the eccen-
tric old women and mothers. Has in her time
attracted great public notice; and was pecu-
liarly honoured by the parish in which she
lived, the authorities having, day and night,
stationed men with paper lanthorns at her
abode, to make known the merits of her
dwelling-house.
These are the principal members of the Company as yet new to the
London stage; but we are happy to say that the Manager, with a
determined spirit to meet the taste of the town, has, reckless of cost,
at an immense expense engaged—
MISS ALICE LOWE |
We can also assure the public that all the minor arrangements of
the Theatre are regulated in the same spirit manifest in the above.
Hence, the very stage-door-keeper is a returned convict, nor is there
one of the money-takers who has not survived a charge of embezzle-
ment.

GLORIOUS TERMINATION OF THE WAR WITH CHINA'ſ
GRAND Government SCHEME!!
SUPPLYING THE METROPOLIS WITH TEAll I
HE War with China is over—
Confucius be praised for it. Sir
Henry Pottinger is to be created
= Lord Hyson—having for his ar-
morial bearings, three Mandarin's
heads, tied together by their tails,
surmounted by a teapot volante.
Tea will now be plenty, and
Sir James Graham has hit upon a
notable scheme. The great New
River reservoir, from which the
City is at present supplied with
water, is to be immediately con-
verted into a huge metropolitan tea-
pot, the delicious contents of which
will henceforth form the material
------- of circulation through the many
veins and arteries which now convey to every corner of the City that
insipid trash called water. As soon as this is effected, it is supposed
that the neighbourhood of the reservoir will become the favourite
evening promenade for the ladies. It was at first proposed that the
infusion should be made regularly twice a day in the Thames, so
that the Metropolis might be supplied on the grandest scale. But
this was objected to, on the ground that it would hold out an irre-
sistible tempation to suicide among the elderly females, particularly
those among them, who, by their own obstinacy and self-will, are
doomed to a cup of single cursedness, and who would be seen plunging
daily in dozens from the parapet of Waterloo-bridge. |
Furnaces, on an immense scale, are to be constructed below the
reservoir. These furnaces are to be attended by battalions of
Sinecurists and State-Pensioners, who, in consideration of the arduous
duties to be thus imposed upon them, are to be allowed their tea
gratis, twice a-day, although they are to find their own bread and
butter. As Lord Abinger is in search of official promotion, it has
been decided to make him General Superintendant of the Fire
Department. The Duke of Newcastle is to furnish the necessary
amount of coal. Before being distributed the tea is to be prepared
with milk and sugar in the reservoir, and tasted, to see that there is
a proper harmony between all the ingredients, by a Committee of
Taste to be appointed for that purpose, and to consist of the Duchesses
of Sutherland and Buccleuch and the Hon. George Edward Anson,
assisted by the Earls of Haddington and Aberdeen. As it is supposed
that an enormous amount of sugar will be required, the English ports
are to be thrown open to the Brazils; and to meet the deficiency in
the revenue, which this is expected to occasion, Sir R. Peel intends
to impose a tax upon teeth—which, it is thought, will drive false ones
out of the market. To meet the demand for milk, the Duke of
Buckingham has engaged to keep 10,000 head of “horned cattle” in
the neighbourhood of the reservoir. The office of Lord High Dairy-
man is to be conferred upon Sir Edward Knatchbull; and Colonel
Sibthorpe is to be immediately despatched to St. Petersburgh to
negotiate a treaty with the Emperor Nicholas for a regular supply of
Polish turnips, as fodder for the cattle. The turnips are to be of the
best and juiciest kind—the one the Colonel carries on his shoulders
to be a sample to the Autocrat.
Pumps are to be erected in the various streets and squares of the
City, by which troughs will be kept constantly supplied, from which
the passer-by may suck himself full by means of one of several
tubes which is to be kept dangling from their respective troughs for
the public accommodation. The intended fountains in Trafalgar-
square are henceforth to squirt out hot tea; Nelson's column is to
be diverted from its original purpose, and is now to be completed
as a memorial of our glorious Chinese triumph —its elegant shaft
is to be crowned with a splendid Corinthian capital, which latter
is to sustain a Mammoth Britannia-metal Teapot, from which a con-
stant stream is to descend upon the head and shoulders of King
Charles. For this brilliant idea the Government is indebted to the
Colonial Secretary. White Conduit House will be deserted, and
Tea-gardens established in the neighbourhood of Apsley House.
Measures will also be adopted for the supply of the other large
towns of the kingdom from the same source. All the railroads,
proceeding from the metropolis, are to have attached to their different
trains a set of patent locomotive urns, by which the beverage can bo
transmitted hot to Birmingham, Manchester, &c.; and Viscount
Lowther is digesting a plan whereby the smaller towns can be
supplied through the Post Office.
The two houses of Parliament are to be liberally supplied. In the
Upper House, the Lord Chancellor will preside over the tea-table.
In the House of Commons, each member is to be provided with a
tube, from which, by means of a stop-cock, he can refresh himself in the
midst of a long debate. The Radical members are only to have a
tube between every two of them. Messrs. Hume and Roebuck going
together, &c. - Sir Robert thinks that when this is effected, there
will be less difficulty in “making a house;” and is confident that
fewer of the members will hereafter get drunk.
The small reservoir in the Green Park is to be converted into a
great pap basin, for the special use of the juvenile generation; to
which the Dowager Lady Lyttleton is daily to convey the Prince of
Wales and Princess Royal, for their morning meal. Over this, the
Queen Dowager is to preside.
The refuse tea leaves are to be given to his Grace of Buckingham,
to manure, with them, the vale of Aylesbury. By this politic step,
the Government expect to re-acquire his Grace's countenance and
co-operation.
A FRIEND to look up to.
It is rumoured in the best informed circles that, when all is
completed, it is the intention of her Majesty to invite the various
crowned heads of Europe to a great tea-party; on which occasion it
is intended to take advantage of hospitality, and secure, if possible,
Louis-Philippe's consent to the right of search treaty. The President
of the United States will not be invited, because he is “too vulgar.”
The Cabinet have not yet decided to send a card to Espartero the
Regent; or whether it will be altogether safe to solicit the attend-
ance of his Holiness the Pope, as it is probable that his coming in
contact with the Archbishop of Canterbury might occasion a row.
THE MOON'S RISING AND SETTING.
In the year 1843, there will be a new moon thirteen times, but it has
not yet been discovered what is done with the old ones.
The moon will be eclipsed by the clock at the Horse Guards, when
it gets into perigee behind the tower in the centre of the building.
When the moon is in the crescent it may be seen either in Mornington
or Burton, and it will be in the last quarter some time after Michaelmas.
WATERLOO BRIDGE REPORT.
The shareholders in Waterloo Bridge met a few days ago, and a very
animated discussion took place upon the prospects of the company. The
old debt remains in statu quo, and the middle-aged debentures with the
coupon continues without the interest. A proprietor wished to know
what was to become of the original adventurers; and whether they were
likely to get anything in the end. The chairman replied that it would be
quite at §. end if they ever did get º;
A subscriber was desirous of putting a few questions. He wanted to
know what was paid for the exhibition of the playbills on the freehold
railings belonging to the company (Hear, hear.) He thought that the
display of those things injured the bridge, for many persons who intend
going over it and paying the toll were likely to stop to read the play-bills, and
forget all about the bridge. (Much cheering). The chairman said that
was for the consideration of the shareholders. His (the chairman's) duty
was to hear (hear) and say nothing. (Order). The same shareholder
would ask whether the Revd. O'Gorman Gregg was the real lessee of
the railing on which was exhibited the placard headed “a bloodless cure

for the tooth-ache,” and whether the company acted fairly by an old
tenant in letting any part of their premises to the proprietor of the specific
for curing the tooth-ache by “smoking only.” (Hear.). The chairman
had not seen the contract with either party, nor had he the honour of an
acquaintance with the Rev. O'Gorman Gregg ; but he believed the Rev.
Gentleman had not remonstrated with the company. (Cheers.) A share-
holder was happy to see that suicides preferred jumping from Waterloo
in preference to the other bridges. He thought this was owing partly
to the reduction of the toll, and as it was expedient to meet the wishes of
the public generally, he was glad that the company seemed to give com-
plete satisfaction to that unfortunate class of customers. The accounts
were then audited. It appeared that after paying all the current expenses
with a portion of the old balance, and an instalment on the unfunded debt,
there remained some loose silver and a few halfpence, which it was decided
should be added to the old rest, for the benefit of the fifth class of
reversionary creditors.
Qſìjeatrítal Łntelligentt.
Miss KELLY's little band-box has again closed for further “extensive
preparations,” with a view to the prodnction of more “attractive novelties.”
The plan pursued during the past short season, of advertising a favourite
farce or drama, without stating the names of the pieces, gave general
satisfaction. The cook (as stage manager) or the housemaid (as prompter)
came with a small list, like the waiter at an eating-house, of things “ready
in the house,” and the visitors, or visitor, selected his own entertainment.
The affair was managed thus:–
Housemaid. What will you please to take :
Audience. What have you got?
Housemaid. There's “Sergeant's Wife,” “Sister of Charity,” “Irish
Tutor,” (just up), “The Nayades,” (every part cast), “Mrs. Parthian at
Home,” (quite hot.
Audience. Let's have a bit of “Mrs. Parthian at Home.”
Housemaid. We don't cut it sir, but you can have one act of the “Sister
of Charity,” or a slice of the “Sergeant's Wife,” but Mrs. Parthian can't
be divided.
The REIGN of tertroit.
This plan, of course, suited all tastes, but we have not heard whether it
is to be continued in future seasons.
We don't know whether there is to be a Christmas pantomime for the
holiday folks; but if there is, though the parlours and drawing-rooms may
not fill so well, the lessee may calculate on crowded attics, and overflowing
washhouses during the festive season.
We understand that Mr. Hamilton from “The Band-box,” is to appear

THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION AND WALKER.
This young lady has been lecturing on the Constitution, at the
National Hall of Science, in High Holborn. She took a rapid view
of history from the time of Noah down to last week, and treated on
every thing inclusively, from the fall of Adam to the ousting of Lord
Melbourne. The constitution she observed was originally invented by
MAJon and Minoru canons.
De Lolme, had been afterwards a great deal shapen by Morison's pills,
and was now expected to revive by the bolus of Chartism. Morison,
she said, used to prescribe forty of his celebrated No. 6. She, Miss
Mary Anne Walker, recommended millions of No. 1, and that in
fact No. 1 should be kept in view by all of them. She then took a
rapid glance at the reign of Boadicea, gave a summary of the wars of
Hengist, and came naturally down to our own day, in which the presen-
tation of the Chartist Petition, and the removal of the committee to the
station house in the cart on Kennington Common at the great meeting
last year, were very graphically touched upon. Miss Walker parti-
cularly called upon the young men and entreated them to embrace
her and her principles. In speaking of herself she, of course,
spoke only for herself, and did not mean to pledge Miss Susanna
Inge, or any other of her female compatriots, to any particular adhesion;
but what she, Miss Walker, once embraced, she would throw all her heart
and soul into, and stick to it, (loud cheers). Miss Walker also observed,
that the young men were comparatively cold. She had expected more
from them, but had been disappointed. With regard to the women, let
them look at the Spartan mothers, who cut off their hair to make bow-
strings. She, Miss Walker, could not do that, for she wore a front, and her
back hair was a good deal dwindled away; but they had her heart, and
that was better than her hair any day. She then quoted a p e from
Smith's Wealth of Nations, and a paragraph from the halfpenny illustrated
newspaper, when in a peroration, compounded of scraps from Blackstone,
PUNCH, Wattel, Boz, the Times, Joseph Jenkins, and Miss Martineau, she
sat down amid a whirlwind of applause, from every corner of the building.

PUNCH*S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER xxi.--THE PHILOSOPHY OF GLORY : THE SWORD AND THE
GOSLINGs.
My DEAR Boy, I hoped that, long ere this, your hankering
: passion after what is called glory, had died a natural death; and
that you had begun to consider glory at the best but as a dull
mountebank—a thing of strut, and frippery, and emptiness.
\
When St. Austin was a little boy, he and his mother went on a day's
ancestors.” And a very foolish figure he must cut among such goodly
company.
Fear not, my son ; I am not about to clap in with those shallow
moralists who would show the nothingness of glory, by showing that
which is, indeed, no part of it; who would put the living Caesar's
nose out of joint by displaying his nose “laid bare” in his coffin ; who
would prove that it was a vanity of vanities to paint a fair young Ger-
man whilst in the flesh, because when he took his departure from it,
and was no longer in any way answerable for any disgrace it might
fall into—serpents might gender there. Let us follow out this
philosophy.
The Germans, as you know, are a nation of cabbage-eaters.
They sophisticate good wholesome worts with vinegar, and Beelzebub
alone, who supplies some nations with cooks, knows what beside.
This vegetable wickedness they call sauerkraut. Now, let us imagine
the immediate descendant of the fair-haired young German, with his
napkin tucked under his chin. about to plunge his fist into the dish.
He pauses—looks serious—a tear steals into the corner of his eye :
solemnly removing the napkin from his button-hole, he rises, and
remembering that the church-yard wherein his ancestor was decently
deposited, has been converted into a vegetable garden, he points to
the sauer kraut, and exclaims, “Behold the vanity of all earthly
things; the particles of our beloved ancestor have undergone a very
peculiar arrangement; what was our dear friend Karl, is now a-
Cabbage "
Now, do we not gather as fine philosophy from the savoy as from
the serpent What is either cabbage or snake to Karl, who,
crowned with amaranth, looks down from his starry home upon his
would-be-wise descendant, and thinks him a prodigious noodle for
pausing in his dinner
I have, I know, in a former letter, indicated the shallowness of
this reasoning as exposed by my very intimate friend the Hermetic
Philosopher; but your last letter, my son, in which you would fain
draw a picture of military glory, has tempted me to this iteration.
I have pondered upon your picture; now, look at mine.
Many years ago I solaced myself with a brief residence in France.

honours that might otherwise have been paid to the reputation of

fields. I well recollect it was Sunday from a sudden jarring of my
moral sense—a shock to my feelings. I was overtaken by a cart
rattling on at a good pace : it contained half a dozen men and
pleasure with a certain Roman praetor, to pay their respects to
the tomb of Caesar. St. Austin has handed down to us the following
lively portrait of the imperial corpse. “It looked of a blue mould;
the bone of the nose laid bare ; the flesh of the nether lip quite
fallen off; his mouth full of worms; and in his eye-pit a hungry
toad, feasting upon the remnant portion of flesh and moisture; and
so,” moralizes the saint, “he dwelt in his house of darkness.” He
did no such thing; he had vacated his dwelling. Death had written
on the corpse “this house to let” and the worms and the toad
became the tenants Well, and what had they to do with Caesar
What had the “blue mouldy flesh” and the “nose laid bare” to do
with Caesar dead, more than the paring of Caesar's nails with Caesar

to a previous occupant Our maiden queen Elizabeth made sundry
progresses; honoured sundry mansions with her might-cap. What,
if, in lapse of time one of these houses should have so fallen in
reputation, that its after iniquity has been published by candle and

ermine fame of our spotless Elizabeth
One Jeremy Taylor, who can occasionally twine death's-heads with
rose-buds, and strew a coffin with spices, tells us a story of a fair
young German gentleman who, though much importuned by many
young ladies to sit for his portrait, would never consent. (So far he
was right; for if there be a plague upon earth, it is the plague of
sitting under a continual struggle to call into your face and keep
there, your very prettiest and most amiable look, until duly fastened
by pigments upon wainscot or canvas.) The fair young Herr,
however, made at last a compromise. He, in the handsomest
manner, consented to sit for his portrait after a few days’ burial,
upon the honourable understanding that the painter visiting the
vault, should limn the corpse just as it appeared : giving no cheek
“a little red,” putting no complimentary dimple in the chin, but
painting death to the life. The painter was sent upon his mission,
and found his sitter with “his face half-eaten, and his midriff and
back-bone full of serpents; and so he stands pictured among his armed
women, laughing as if there were no world to come, and looking as
joyous and as happy as though the devil himself were a mere
abstraction. The worst remains to be told ; the cart, in addition to
the merry-makers, contained a fiddle and a bass-viol; and it was but
too evident from the affectionate way in which the instruments of
sin were hugged by two of the men in the cart, that the unhallowed
cat-gut was to be fingered that very day to the tripping toes and
heels of the wicked. I, who had for years been disciplined by the
moral regularity of an English Sunday—I who had spiritually paid
reverence even to Sabbath-keeping housemaids, as, with noses
flattened against parlour and kitchen panes, they solemnly pondered
on sin and death, and the vacant street before them, wondering when
the milkman would come, and especially wondering if John Roberts
would keep his hour; I, thus naturalized to the proprieties, felt my
blood bubble to my cheek as I beheld the fiddle and the viol, and was
rushing forward to check the horse, and remonstrate with the wicked
holiday-keepers, when, happily, I observed that the driver was
furnished with a long and unusually substantial whip. I stopt, said
a short prayer for their souls, and struck into the fields.
Sunk many fathoms deep in my feelings, I was wandering over a
field of vetches, when I was startled by the loud and significant
utterance of miscellaneous oaths, while a half-quacking, half-whistling
noise rose as a sort of under-accompaniment to the execration.
Lifting up my eyes, I beheld a garde-champêtre, in cocked hat, with a
drawn sword. Now, a garde-champêtre, my son, is a sort of field-
constable, who takes charge of the crows in his district, with the
sloe and blackberry bushes; who sees that the moles are not
disturbed in their subterranean operations, and who benevolently
assists the hogs out of the mud, should they chance to stick in it :
albeit the provision of nature was never more beautifully displayed
than in the anatomy of French hogs, for Nature knowing what
dreadful miry roads they have to walk upon, has benevolently put
them upon stilts. To return to the garde-champêtre.
I looked and beheld this field-officer, as I have said, in cocked hat
and with drawn sword; and there he was swearing and shouting, at
No. 75.

those successful husbands who are lodged, boarded, dressed, and
allowed pocket-money by their helpmates.) The absurd deference
paid by us to our women is finely rebuked by Continental nations,
where they have the prettiest words for the beau sere, and nothing
beyond. I know not a more dignified condition of man than that

LETTER xxii.-ON THE Clio ICE AND TREATMENT OF A WIFE.
MY DEAR SoN,+It was the remark of a no less distinguished
mountebank than Cardinal de Retz—(he and I were very intimate,
albeit he never publicly acknowledged the acquaintanceship), that
it mattered little what were the talents of a man, what was his good
fortune in every other respect, if he were unlucky in a wife. By
which the Cardinal meant—and if he did not, I do—that a wife to
be justly called the better part of a man must bring with her a suf-
ficient quantity of the precious metal : otherwise, she is only flesh of
his flesh, and bone of his bone; a burden of clay, and not an orna-
ment of gold. Happily, my son, this truth is now so generally
acknowledged in good society that, unless you were wilfully callous
to its influence, you could not fail to be affected by it. A wife is the
husband's chattels—the philosophy of law declares it : indeed, the
spouse of your bosom is considered by the law to be goods in a more
especial degree than any other property. A man robs you of your
wife, and thereby—I put an extreme case—snaps your heart-strings:
you lose your better half, and you sue the thief to make good the
loss by the payment of so many pieces of metal. The same man,
respecting your heart-strings, makes a snatch at your watch-chain,
and takes to his heels with the booty. You shout “Stop thief r" but
the rogue escapes you. Well, the thief would quietly arrange the
matter; would, for a fair consideration that should remunerate him
for skill and loss of time, render back the abstracted chronometer.
Hereupon the law cries—“What are you about what I compro-
mise a felony Beware of the penalty 1” No : you must put the
thief into the dock, if he can be caught ; you must punish him for
the wrong he has done to society by stealing your repeater. If, on
the other hand, he steal your wife, the matter—by the benevolent aid
of judge and jury—may be settled between you, and your attorney
empowered to give a fair receipt for the damages. Thus, above all
other mundane possessions, a wife is property.
It is with this conviction of the true value of female excellence,
that you must cast your eyes about you for a wife. You are to
reflect upon the huge amount of evil brought upon man by woman,
and are therefore in your own person to obtain as great a degree of
reparation as is possible from the daughters of the first offender.
You know the condition of a wife in the savage state. She is the
drudge of her despotic lord; who does little but look at himself in a
glass, if he have been lucky enough to change skins for one; sings,
eats, plays, and meets in council. His wife with a wooden mattock,
or the shoulder-blade of a buffalo, digs the earth and sows the corn;
she drives away the birds, and in due season, gathers the harvest :
she pounds corn and salts buffalo's meat; and hews wood and
draws water, and prepares the feast ; in journeys, she carries the
poles of the wigwam, and when a station is pitched upon, it is she
who sets the wigwam up, her sovereign lord, the Great Eagle, doing
nothing. My dear boy, it is even so in the very best society: that
is, if the woman herself do not labour in all these menial offices, she
brings the money by which they are done, and the convenience and
enjoyment of her husband are equally well insured. In whatever rank
of life you are doomed to move, you are to choose your wife as the
Indian chooses his squaw—for her ability to minister to your
idleness.
I am sorry to say it, in England, women are held in even super-
stitious veneration : for the most part treated as creatures of superior |
its beauty and its excellence.

In your choice of a wife, never forget that age is to be honoured
when associated with money. Nothing more reverend than silver
hairs with gold in the pockets. Besides, by marrying a woman well-
stricken in years, you will be insured against the tortures of jealousy,
at least on your own part, and what is more you will have con-
tinually by your side (that is, when you are at home) a memento of
the certain decay of mortality; which memento, if you rightly consider
it, will be the surest inducement for you to enjoy life by every
strictly legal means in your power. In all your pleasures, however,
respect the laws of your country. Remember, that an act of par-
liament is like a rock; it matters not how nearly you approach it,
so you do not bump against it.
As for your days of courtship, you are to remember that as woman
is the weaker animal, it behoves your magnanimity never to cross
her fancy even in its most ridiculous whimsies. Give her, as horse-
men have it, her head as much as she likes until you turn from the
church : you may then assert the supremacy of manhood, and revenge
the wrongs of Adam.
There are various ways of attaching the sex : but the surest is, not
to attempt to shine and sparkle, and go off in crackers of jokes
before them. Women, somehow, have the same fear of witty men as
of fireworks; and thus, how often do pretty lively creatures link
themselves to fools . The most certain plan of success (I have it
from a woman, and I believe an excellent authority) is any way toº
interest them. In my own case—(I thought your poor mother had a
deal of money, but—well, never mind)—I at last affected consump-
tion. For a long time your mother refused to have me; when, how-
ever, I made her believe that I should not live six weeks, she
married me directly. If an heiress refuse you, pretend to take to
your bed with typhus fever, and ten to one but she'll insist upon your
getting up to go to church with her.
If, after long courtship, you find the lady has not the money you
at first imagined, hesitate not a moment, but drop her. It may
seem cruel, but depend upon it, 'tis all for her good. As for the
nonsense of romantic writers about the wear and tear of the female
heart, 'tis a lie in print, and nothing more. Wear and tear !
Female hearts never tear: no, my son; they always stretch.

THE “SABRE” AND THE “CROSS.”
The subjoined paragraph from a French journal, the Commerce, is
still vital in some of our newspapers:—
“Before the Minister of War made a grant of 5,000 acres of land in
Algeria to the community of the Trappists, the head of the order, at
the Minister's request, visited the colony, and reported that an esta-
blishment of his order there would effect much good, by holding
vertheless, the bones of seventy thousand of the smallest Frenchmen
must, according to the chemist's showing, weighed out in tons and
the land duly drest therewith, have gone far to redeem the curse
of sterility originally laid upon the soil. Such is certainly our im-
pression; and yet it is hard to disbelieve the holy Trappist—harder
still to suspect the most Christian, cross-respecting general. Are we
then to imagine that the usefulness, the high social and moral value
of the soldier, as employed in Algeria—cutting throats, burning, des.
out an example of the best mode of reclaiming the waste lands. General
Bugeaud is said to have embraced the plan with delight, and to have said
to the superior—The sabre FIRst my recerend father, and THEN the cross.”
How beautiful is Christianity, and especially French Christianity,
in regimentals | Bug EAUD–pious Bug EAUD !—is worthy of still
higher promotion. We would have him gazetted “General of the
Army of Martyrs;” even though the said army—raised in France—
should not be more numerous than that of General BoMBAstEs.
The bullet first, and then the consecrated wafer The burning of
Arab houses—the groans and agony of murdered men—the despairing
screams of violated women—the wailing and misery of orphan
children, and then—yes, and then—The lamb-like priest, the healing
oil and honey of the church, the sanctifying censers, and, most hideous
mockery of all, the blaspheming TE DEUM
The cross set up by the French Mars in Algeria . What should we
say of the murderer and burglar who should leave a copy of The
Whole Duty of Man on the hearth-stone of his victims But there are
a set of Christians who constantly confound the cross with the gibbet,
and deem a place of bloodshed and rapine the spot of all others best
chosen for it. There is no doubt that General Bug EAUD is of
this persuasion. We can fancy him, in his meekness, setting a
morning edge to his sabre on the cover of the New Testament.
The Trappists, however, are received in Algeria with, it may be
said, military honours. They are to be allowed to reclaim waste
lands; and may have this comforting assurance that, under the
active patronage of General Bug EAUD, they will lack neither terri-
tory nor employment. By means of the sabre, the cross may be
planted in the midst of thousands of war-blasted acres. What its
influence may be on the homeless, desolate, stiff-necked Arab, we
know not ; but we have our fears, and suspect that the native
wickedness of his heart will make him deaf to the voice of the
charmer—the Trappist. Indeed we are prone to agree with a pro-
found and humane correspondent in Galignani's Messenger, who a week
or two since, sketched the character of the Arab in a few bold, black
lines, and then opposed to it, in bright and softly-blending colours, the
moral and religious beauty of his conqueror. The Arab's religion,
said the reasoner sorrowfully, is a religion of revenge ; how, then, is
he to be won by the charity, the self-denying loveliness of the Chris-
tian faith? We allow the difficulty: since, where in Algeria is he to
meet with it ! The infidel will scarcely love that as the fire of Chris-
tianity which burns his homestead ; nor will he be quick to acknow-
ledge the meekness of the dove, when he has to satisfy what, in his
ignorance, he deems the maw of the vulture. To burn his crops may,
indeed, make him yearn for daily bread ; but scarcely in that con-
fiding and affectionate spirit required by HIM who framed that
sublimest invocation.
“The Sabre first, and then the Cross 1” And so, on his own showing,
is Marshal BUGEAUD waste-land maker to the Church. If, how-
ever, our memory fail not, the Marshal's apophthegm smacks of the
plagiarist. Was there not an enthusiast named MAHoMET, who, a
few centuries since, rose in this same land of Arabia, and exclaimed,
“The Sword and the Koran f" Doubtless, the influence of the
place—the genius loci—has touched the Marshal; hence, he would
associate with Christianity what was hitherto considered the pecu-
liar maxim of Mahometanism. Christianity, even in Arabia, had,
we thought, other weapons than cold steel. Marshal Bug EAUD
a changé tout cela.
But waste lands in Algerial Waste lands occupied by the French :
How can this be Let us expose the fallacy.
Professor Johnstone, in his recent Lectures on Agricultural Chemistry,
says that “one ton of bone-dust is equal to fourteen tons of manure.”
Now, it has been shown by French statists themselves, that the pos-
session of Algeria has, up to the present time, consumed seventy
thousand Frenchmen We are aware that the valuable members
drawn from French society, to compose the great body of the French
army, are not fastidiously selected for their height or weight of bone,
and will therefore concede that more than an average number of
skeletons may be required for the ton, than if weighed—and how
rarely has Justice used her balance to weigh such materials —from
the skeletons of Prussian pandours or English life-guardsmen. Ne-
troying, and carrying away captive—is confined to these humanizing
deeds of his active life : Is he, of all mortal compounds, to be of no
utility when dead? Does he render back nothing to his ill-used
mother earth Alas! it is even so ; for the bones of seventy thou-
sand Frenchmen have been laid in Algeria, and still—ungrateful
soil l—the land is barren. In the old poetic day, armed men sprang
up from merely dragons' teeth; and now, we find whole battalions dug
into the soil, that sends forth nothing better than wild chamomile or
chickweed. We cannot, in the case of gallant captains buried in
Algeria, prefer even the pious aspiration of the poet –
* O'er thee, then, may thyme and sweet-marjoram wave,
And ſat be the gander that feeds on thy gravel”
The fields of Algerian glory yield not a single breakfast to a stubble
goose. No—all is barren. We traverse the bloody earth, encum-
bered—not, it seems, enriched—with the bones of seventy thousand
men, and find there neither ear of wheat, nor (oh believe it, General
Bug EAUD), sprig of laurel.
Sad tidings, these, for France; for as it is calculated that Algeria
will annually consume (consume is the word) seven thousand men,
the fathers and mothers of the “material” should at least be com-
forted with the conviction that they are watching, nursing, petting,
their children to die a death of African glory. This consolation
is, however, denied to them. Bones at this moment nascent
in the wombs of France will, if present policy continue, be
dug into the soil of Algeria, and still—for every purpose that should
ennoble man,—still it will be barren. To be sure, Christianity, which
with our old-fashioned prejudices we would have to prevent slaughter,
may—in the Trappist's masquerading gown—come after the fight,
and for the sake of future fertility, beg a portion of the pillage; and
some future captain, in the piety of his soul, may reverentially
bestow the stolen goods of the brigand on the frock of the fanatic.—
The mummery of the future may be but a repetition of the mummery
of the present.
“The sabre first and then the Cross l’”
The drum, and then the Voice crying in the Wilderness—the
devastation of Arab crops, and then the Loaves and Fishes—the
pioneers, and then the Twelve Apostles—General Bug EAUD, and
THEN–the gentle JEsus !

In thistles so rich, and abundant in grass;

While the last is dealt niggardly out once a day.

Are all of my tribe who the Custom-house pass ;
Ill treatment, hard work, and perpetual hunger,
In England await the Colonial Ass.
But, alas ! it is vain my affliction thus telling—
Complaining I know will but little avail;
For none on the Donkey's lament will be dwelling—

It would seem that in Troy six carats were equal to one pennyweight;
or, in other words, that carrots were sold at the rate of six a penny in that
famous city of antiquity. Helen is said to have had red hair, and we
ought not therefore to be surprised that in Troy carrots were extremely
plentiful.

APOTHECARLES' weight.
It would seem that the Apothecaries were formerly a very sober class
of men, for according to the old standard they had three scruples to a
dram ; but whatever those scruples originally may have been, some of the
apothecaries of our own day have got over them.
BEER MEASURE.
Beer measure varies exceedingly, and depends a good deal upon the
honesty of the person employed to go for it. It is generally something
less “in your own mugs,” than in the pewter-pot ; and it is a curious fact
that a pot of porter brought by a juvenile becomes shorter in quantity the
longer the distance he has to carry it.

This splendid and classic property is destined to fall beneath the Robinsonian
hammer. The poet has felt a delicacy in treating at length a subject which, in the
hands of Mr. George Robins, will no doubt give rise to one of the finest pieces of
fiction in the English language. His mind imagination has already converted into
a fine speculation, and a means of realising a princely income.

PUNCH AND THE COLOSSEUM PRINT.
“The Illustrated London News” has promised its subscribers a large
view of London, to be called the Colosseum Print; and our contemporary
pompously announces his intention of taking his sketch from “a lofty
eminence of London,” which it required “official authority” to enable him
to reach. This “ lofty eminence” turns out to be the Duke of York's
Column, and the “official authority” is the man put at the bottom of the
column to beat off the boys and take the threepences, by the payment of
which the public can purchase the “privilege” that our highly-illuminated
Economy; Making both ENDs MEET.
contemporary is so exceedingly “nutty” upon. It is, however, asserted
that the artist goes up the winding staircase “by the generous and nobly-
granted permission ºd. Maitland, for himself and his co-trustees ;
who have thus confided to us,” says The Illustrated London News, “an
exclusive right ! that stimulated our proprietors to a degree of exertion
which they hope will prove worth ...} the signal mark of favour !! they
have received.” We cannot see #. exclusiveness of a right which may
be enjoyed for threepence almost any day in the week, between the hours
of ten and four; while the only stimulus to exertion which we can perceive
is the stimulus necessary to induce any one to mount to the top of the
column. . [f the proprietors are allowed to go up as often as they like for
nothing, it may be, perhaps, considered “a signal mark of favour;” and
we can only say that “sich a getting up stairs” we never did, and never
wish to see.
Punch has some idea of giving his readers a print of some great metro-
politan thoroughfare, but we have not made up our minds where the most
picturesque view could be taken from. Whetstone Park is a well-sounding
name, but would make an indifferent picture; and Baldwin's Gardens may
be open to a similar objection. Trafalgar Square, as seen from the spout
of St. Martin's pump, would make a fine scene; but we have applied to
the parochial authorities, and they refuse us the privilege of sending our
artist to the spout, and it is impossible that we can afford to make our
arrangements unless we have recourse to the spout as circumstances may
require. Blackfriars Bridge, from the Waithman Column, is certainly
open to us, and we are glad to announce that the trustees of that miracu-
lous piece of masonry have liberally offered us the use of the railings;
and the spikes are at our artist's service for the whole of the necessary
sittings.
DOWN WITH THE FACULTY.
The “Times,” a few days since, contained the following an-
nouncement :—
“Morisonian Prizes of 30l., 20., and 10l., for the three best Essays
on the Medical Liberty of the Subject. For further particulars, see
the ninth number of the Hygeist, published on the 1st instant, at the
Medical Dissenter Office, 368, Strand, and all the Hygeian Agents
throughout the country. British College of Health, Hamilton Place,
New Road, London.”
Mr. Punch has determined on trying for the 30l. ;—not that he
cares about the coin, which, should he be successful, will be handed
over to the Street-Sweepers' Fund Society. Let the Public judge of
his performance.
THE MEDICAL LIBERTY OF THE SUBJECT.
Vainly have ignorance and superstition combined to extinguish
the pipe of mind, and to cast a wet blanket on the fire of genius.
Galileo was persecuted by the Inquisition, John Huss and Jerome of
Prague were burnt by the Council of Constance; Columbus was
quizzed, and Newton derided—in vain. Fruitlessly did Prince and
Prelate endeavour to tread out the flame of truth ; it flared up in
spite of priestcraft and oppression; and now, like a Boccius-light on
some proud eminence, it diffuses far and wide over the nations its
refulgent beams.
So will it be with medicine. The faculty, like the bigoted hierarchy
of the middle ages, by tongue, by pen, and by the iron arm of legal
tyranny, are endeavouring to crush and quell the spirit of medical
dissent. Will they succeed We rather think not. The hour is
coming when the College of Physicians shall meet in mortal shock
the College of Health. The dismounted doctors shall bite the dust,
the idols of prejudice be trampled under foot; and the true worship
of Hygeia, established throughout the earth, shall be denominated
“The Reformation of the Nineteenth Century.” Yes. Already we
have reformed our House of Commons, we are even now reforming
our tailors' bills; and the reform of our physicians' fees—tremble, ye
licensed homicides —is at hand.
The universal medicine (sold by respectable agents in every consider-
able town throughout the world) cures all diseases. This fact, which
thousands are ready to substantiate on oath, speaks for itself. Why,
then, are the impostors called medical men, whether physicians, sur-
geons, or apothecaries, longer permitted to delude the public Were
the grand truths of medical dissent once acknowledged, they would
not be tolerated another day. Their practices and practice would be
together suppressed. “But what, then,” the superficial thinker may
ask, “will become of the medical liberty of the subject " We an-
swer, that liberty is not licence; on the contrary, that it is inconsistent
therewith : consequently, that where it prevails, there can be no
licentiates. True liberty of conscience, in medicine as well as in every-
thing else, is not the liberty of thinking as we please, but the liberty
of thinking right. We say that we are right, and the faculty wrong,
as we can prove, if necessary, by three millions of well-authenticated
cases; inclusive of that of Simon Saunders, aged forty-two, who was
cured last week of club feet and cataract, by a few doses of the vege-
table pills. The following is an authentic copy of the letter which
was received from Mr. S.:—

Mr. Saunders may not be an educated person; but the value of a
man's testimony depends not on his literary character. Now what
will the world say ? The above almost miraculous case, for the publi-
cation of which, in a darker age, we should inevitably have been sent
to the stake, must carry to the most sceptical mind a conviction of
the truth of the Hygeian system. But our enemies feel, in their secret
souls, that we are in the right. A certain distinguished surgeon was
asked confidentially, not long ago, whether the Universal Pills would
really cure all diseases, and he whispered that there was no doubt
they would—equally well.
It is time that the grievances of the medical dissenters should be
removed. The persecution which they suffer is a disgrace to the age.
It is pretended by interested parties that their complaints are un-
founded—that they are not persecuted at all. But what are the
duties imposed on the Vegetable Pills—what are the verdicts of
coroners' juries when patients, for want of taking a sufficient number
of boxes, have died, but persecution ? Nay, what is the very exist-
ence of the medical profession, but a virtual persecution of the medi-
cal dissenter The Hygeists are in the sole possession of truth ;
every opponent of the truth is a persecutor; and therefore the oppo
sition which medical men must, as long as they are tolerated, offer to
Hygeian verity, is in itself persecution. Or, to vary the argument:
persecution is the deprivation of any man or body of men of their
rights. . Now, it has been abundantly proved that the College of
Health ought exclusively to be allowed to practise medicine; con-
sequently, to allow anybody else to do so, is an infringement of its
due privileges.
It is arrogantly asserted by some perverse people that the Hygeists
ought to consider themselves well off; that while they have only to
lay out a little money in order to realise by their vocation splendid
fortunes, physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries are obliged first to
spend enormous sums in their education, next to pass severe examin-
ations, and after all to take the very doubtful chance of getting any

patients—whereas these pretended hardships of theirs involve the
severest insult and injury to medical dissent. The expense of medical
studies was intended to keep the profession what is called “respect-
able,” and the examinations to close its doors against those whose
consciences will not allow them to subscribe to erroneous doctrines,
as all doctrines are but these two—that all diseases arise from
impurity of the blood, and that the Universal Pills will cure them.
Here we must be allowed to make a remark which will be slightly
digressive, but short. It is alleged that, let the blood be as healthy
as it will, if you drop a little vitriol into the eye, or rub it with sand-
paper, or prick it with a red-hot needle, you will excite in it the state
called inflammation. We challenge those who maintain this
absurdity to try the experiments on themselves or others.
The only examination that ought to be sanctioned should be con-
ducted by the College of Health. A preliminary subscription to the
two fundamental tenets of medical dissent should be demanded ; and
then the candidate should be asked the single question, “What is the
composition of the Vegetable Pills f" On his capability to answer
this query, his admission should depend.
The “medical liberty of the subject,” then, will mainly consist in
the overthrow of all medical institutions, and the establishment of
the College of Health in their place. Let us obviate a mistake to
which the title of our essay may possibly lead. Be it distinctly under-
stood that we do not mean by “liberty,’” the liberty to sell soothing
syrups, carminatives, stomach or gout pills, balsams of syriacum, or
any other deleterious compound, under the name of medicine. The
only real medicine is the Universal Vegetable Pill ; and we would
have no other permitted. We would prohibit, under severe penalties,
all administration of brandy and salt—all Homoeopathy and cold-
water cures—and allow of no diet, regimen, or remedy, but those of
medical dissent.
The faculty calls the opinions of those who dissent from it, quackery.
Now quackery, or medical heresy, is not a denial of established
authority, but a denial of sound doctrine. The Hygeian tenets are
sound; all others are erroneous : every medical system, therefore,
except medical dissent, is quackery; and all medical persons, except
medical dissenters, are quacks. All those who question our creed
are wilfully blind, perverse and obstinate people: we wish them no
ill; indeed we fervently hope that they may not reap the conse-
quences of their unbelieving spirit: but we very much fear they will
in the mean time let us earnestly labour in the good cause, and cry,
till we can do better, with one heart and voice: “The Medical Liberty
of the Subject for ever,” and “Down with the Faculty.”
THE CATTLE SHOW.
This fine old English exhibition, has been attracting thousands to the
Baker-street Bazaar, and we feel, therefore, called upon to notice it.
The object of the Smithfield Club is to obtain corpulence in cows, bulk
in bulls, pinguidity in pigs, and obesity in beasts of every description.
A specimen of MANRind. At LARGE.
Nothing could be more interesting than the late show or cattle match,
in which it appeared to be the cffort of any beast to match all the rest in
excessive fatness.
The gold medal was won, after a good deal of exciting competition, by a
cow belonging to Sir Charles Tempest.
This romarkable beast had a hard contest with an ox belonging to Lord
Spencer, and nothing could have been finer than the lazy lumpishness of
both when contending for the palm about to be ...?to one of them.
The ox kept one eye shut as if with the exuberance of flesh on the eyelids,
and betting got up to three to one in his favour; but the cow began snoring
with vehemence as if the fat were pressing on the organs of respiration,
and the odds turned immediately. Ox gave a clever grunt, and attempted
to move one of his fore-legs, but suddenly stopped short, and the hopes of
his backers began to rally, when cow rolled over, as if with her own
specific gravity, and falling dead asleep, was declared to be the winner
amidst the most enthusiastic plaudits of the bystanders. The next match
was between the pigs, one of them Earl Radnor's 34 weeks' old Coleshill;
the other, Mr. John Duckley's Warwickshire. Coleshill put on a clever
look of drowsiness, and gave a judicious shiver which caused his corpulency
to quiver with some advantage, when Warwickshire all of a sudden
seemed to swell out as if by inspiration, and betting became brisk at two
to one in his favour. There were, however, loud cries of “Foul,” and it
was evident that Warwickshire had been drawing in a breath in order to
| increase his bulk ; and Coleshill was declared the winner amid much
| cheering. The show of street-chickens was rather meagre, but a prize
was on the point of being awarded to a mews-fed bantam, when it was
discovered that the corpulency of the bird arose from dropsy, and the
amount of the prize was carried over to the general balance in the hands
of the treasurer.
In the evening there was a grand banquet, and the following are
among the toasts that were given :
“Confusion to Jack Sprat, who could eat no fat; and honour to his
excellent wife, who could eat no lean.”
Glee—“Melting moments.”
“The Lord Mayor and his Corporation.”
Chorus—“He’s a jolly good fellow.”
“May the fat never run into the fire.”
Air—“Oh, Greece 1 beloved Greece "
Several complimentary speeches were made, and the President, in
lamenting that his own beast had not won a prize, ingeniously introduced
the celebrated line from Shakspeare,
Would he were fatter;
and the night passed off in perfect good humour and harmony.
THE CASTLES AND ABBEYS OF ENGLAND.
NO. I.-the ELeph Ant AND CASTLE.
ENGLAND has just reason to be proud of her Castles, and as the metro-
polis is the place which, of all others, the country has a right to boast of,
it follows that the Castles in the vicinity of London must be superior to
all other Castles in importance and interest.
The Castle to which we are about to introduce our readers has gained
the name of the Elephant, but why or wherefore is a question which none
of our antiquaries have ever satisfactorily settled. When John pillaged the
barons, and came with his clutching cohorts across the Kennington fron-
chartch. Fort
rining.
tier, his first care was to settle the confiscated estates on his faithful
creatures, and the Bedford Arms were transferred, among others, to the
first duke, who hoisted his ensign over the portico. Hugh de Buggins,
surnamed the Khapper, from his prowess in the field, was for a long time
inaccessible to the arts of John ; but the wily monarch having offered
him a bribe, at once won him over. The Elephant and Castle, of which de
Buggins had been appointed keeper, thus fell into the usurper's grasp, and it
about that time to the sovereign's vindictiveness. It was rebuilt at a
late period, and has at length taken the form in which we now find it.
The principal apartment in the Castle is the donjon keep, now converted
into the bar, and the metal helmets of the old retainers have been pro-
bably meited down into pots for modern purposes. The only relic of feu-
and the vassals have given place to vessels of various sorts and sizes.
The lord of the land, or landlord, who first unfurled his banner with the
emblem of the Elephant on the Castle wall, has since been gathered to
his fathers; but the present holder gets leave and licence to retain the
ancient sign, by doing suit and service once a year to the assembled magis-
trates. The refectory is a square apartment, used in the present day as
a parlour; and the Castle turrets have been cut away frightfully into attics,
while the watch-tower, if one ever existed, has been removed to make way
for chimney-pots.
Stowe, in his Survey, speaks of the Elephant and Castle as a “Rygghte
ancientte spott,” and Crutchley tells us that it is exactly a shilling fare
from Westminster. If the Castle should ever be fortified, its guns could
be fired into the windows of the Fishmongers' Almshouses on one side, and
would command the road to London-bridge on the other. As a defence,
it would seem to have entirely lost its value; but as a pot-house, it still
stands proudly pre-eminent.

THE MEDICAL STUDENTS.—(New SERIEs.)
Cri APTER VII.-how MR. SIMPson BRIGGS WAS comple L.L.E.D. To
LEAVE HIS LODGING8.
OON after the events of the last chapter,
the usual placidity of mind which Mr.
Simpson Briggs enjoyed, was somewhat
startled by a letter he received from
home. The epistle, which was from his
governor, went to state, that, as the lec-
tures were nearly over, he feared his son
would only idle about in London, and
had therefore better return to his home;
which was somewhere on the line of the
Southampton Railway, and rejoiced in a
kind of lath-and-plaster omnibus, which
ran at all kinds of odd hours to meet the
trains ; and never started at the same
hour two consecutive weeks, after the
manner of railway omnibuses in general.
Now this desire on the part of the old gentleman to have his son
at home was exceedingly inconvenient to Mr. Simpson Briggs for
several reasons. Firstly, he had no wish to return ; secondly, he
owed for three months' lodging, and people lately had got into a
nasty habit of expecting to be paid for their goods; and thirdly, if he
went, he would be expected to pay his debts. At present, he lived
upon credit from his landlady, who, being a pious old lady, as we have
stated, thought him a very quiet steady young man, was ignorant
F.W.FNiNGs. At home.
that he was a medical student ; and from his noiseless habits, not
only trusted him so long, but would even have lent him five pounds
had he wanted it.
He was ruminating what he should do, with the letter in his hand
on the morning he received it; when his meditations were broken by
a most discordant noise in the street below, resembling a tune played
backwards on a cracked horn, and followed by shouts of “Yo-he-o!”
“Lurli-e-ty!” and other vivacious outbursts of mirth. . He imme-
diately, to his extreme horror, recognised Jack Randall's voice,
whom he had always studiously avoided asking to his lodgings ; for
knowing the rather exuberant hilarity of his disposition, he feared
that his presence might offend his quiet old landlady, and procure
him a notice to pay for and quit his abode at the same time. And
Jack Randall had been in general very considerate, and not at all
obtrusive; but he was in superabundant spirits this morning, and evi-
dently boiling over with something he wished to tell his companion.
“I say, old fellow, let us up, will you?" was the question that
greeted Mr. Briggs as he opened the window, and put his head out to
check Randall's hullaballoo.
“Well, come up, if you must,” replied Simpson, in a tone of resig-
nation; “but why are you kicking up that awful riot f"
“All right,” replied Jack; “I only wanted to see if you were at
home.” And thereupon he pulled the bell, and knocked at the door,
and blew the horn, all at once, with a perseverance that threw the
whole household into convulsion : and no one could have told which
was the most alarmed—Mr. Simpson Briggs or his landlady.
In two minutes more Jack Randall had clattered up stairs, and
entered the room. He looked exceedingly rakish, and had evidently
been knocking about all night; which manner of passing the hours
devoted to slumber having rendered him rather thirsty than other-
wise, his first speech was an inquiry as to the presence of beer in any
of Briggs's secret closets. A bottle of stout was forthwith produced
from some mysterious recess, which Jack Randall emptied into a
pewter pot he found in the hat-box, stating it was very low-to drink beer
out of glasses. And having pronounced his state of health to be unuch
better after his imbibition, he proceeded to exhibit an old cornet-à-
piston he held in his hand, which he had just purchased at a second-
hand shed, and then offered to give Briggs a specimen of its tone.
“No, don't—pray don't l” cried Simpson, quite alarmed ; “you'll
tire yourself.”
“Not at all, my dear fellow,” said Randall, putting the instrument
to his mouth, and producing a series of sounds seldom equalled and
never excelled. “There,” he continued, as he stopped for lack of
wind; “there ! what do you think of that I mean to play it down
to the races—how are you going 1"
“I don't think I shall go at all,” answered Simpson; “the
governor wants me at home. How are you going t”
“All right,” said Jack, “on a soda-water truck; devilish pleasant
way too, when the corks don't fly with the heat. Look here,” he
continued, darting off to another subject, as he took a small quill
from his pocket; “here's a funny thing t”
And to show the powers of this instrument to his friend, he poured
some beer into the inkstand, and inserting one end of the quill into
the liquid, blew through the other, when a loud whistle was the
result, bearing a close resemblance to the chirp of a bird. “It beats
Herr Von Joel hollow, don't it?” he asked, with admiration, as the
performance concluded; “I gave a penny for it, as I come along in
the Recent Incision.”
“The what?” asked Simpson.
“The Recent Incision—it's the polite name for the New Cut. Let's
give the people in the street the benefit of it.”
“No, don’t, Jack,” earnestly implored Briggs.
“What prime plants you’ve got here !” said Randall, heedless of
Simpson's petition, and opening the window, on the outside ledge of
which were displayed several flower-pots of mignonette and other
cockney floricultural favourites. “They look very dry, though—don't
you think I had better give them a little beer?”
“No-what are you thinking about !” cried Briggs, in agony;
“you'll kill them.”
“Devil a bit,” returned Jack. “It’ll do them good—make them
blow all colours at once;” and without another word, he distributed
about a pint of stout over the hapless flowers, which running over,
dripped down upon the heads of the people who were passing below,
and produced a storm of salutations far more expressive of choler
than courtesy.
“There !—see what mischief you are doing, said Mr. Briggs.
“Now, come and sit down quietly, and tell us what you did last night
after the concert. I left you in Covent Garden.”
“Well, I went and played billiards, at the rooms we generally
patronise, and lost five shillings—all I had, except sixpence.”
“I know that table, well,” said Briggs; “I ought to; I was locked
out one night, and slept upon it. They made me pay nine shillings
in the morning for my bed.”
“How so?” asked Jack Randall.
“Six hours' use of the table, at eighteen-pence an hour,” returned
Simpson.
“Well, cut on, where did you get to next t "
“I went to Evans's There I had a pint of stout, and sang a song”
“Oh gammon, Jack 1" observed Mr. Briggs, in a tone of disbelief.
“True bill, sir,” answered Randall. “I’ll sing it now.”
“No, don't, don't—pray don't!” cried Briggs. “I tell you, you
mustn't make a noise here.”
But Randall did not appear to heed the trouble of his friend, but
cleared his throat, as if in preparation, and then broke out into a run
one of wee-BEAR's waltzes.
of such wonderful facility and execution, that there is no knowing
where it would have ended, if a knock at the door had not inter-
rupted it, and an accompanying voice, which uttered, “If you please,
Mr. Briggs, missus will thank you to be a little quieter, because there's
a sick lady in the house.”
“There now, Jack!” cried Briggs. “See what a scrape you will
get me into. Never mind the song—you can sing it to me another
time. Where did you go next?”
“Oh—I forgot to tell you,” answered Randall; “I met two of the
students at Evans's—Robinson and Parry, with a new man named
Hicks, whom they were showing life to, and telling him all the lies
they could possibly invent. Poor fellow !”
“What makes you say poor fellow t”
“Because he's in the police-office, and will be brought up at Bow-
street this morning.”
“How's that "asked Simpson.

“Why, I think he ate too many poached eggs, and they rather
exhilarated him; for when we got into Covent Garden, he would
insist upon trying to drag us in a vegetable cart. He lifted up the
shafts to do it, when the cart, which was loaded with turnips, was
overbalanced, and tipped up backwards. The chain, which went
across from one shaft to the other, caught hold of him, and lifted him
up like a swing into the air, and there he sat.”
“Well, and what did you do?”
“We saw the policeman coming, and ran away as fast as we could.
Hicks was nailed, and Isuppose by this time has paid his five shillings
—very little lark for five shillings, though—was it not **
“Uncommon,” replied Mr. Briggs. “And where did you go next 2"
“Why, I can't exactly remember,” said Randall, whose ideas of
his subsequent adventures appeared to be rather indistinct. “But,
you see, here I am, allright, and fresh as a lark. I say, what have
you got for breakfast !”
Mr. Simpson Brigg was compelled to confess that there was not a
great deal in the house. Whereon Randall took upon himself to
find out, and having looked into various closets and boxes, at last
opened the chest which we have spoken of before as communicating
with the floor below.
“Halloo !” he cried, with some astonishment. “What the deuce
is this I can see right down into the room underneath—Halloo !”
“Hush for goodness' sake, don't kick up that row, Jack. The
place was formerly an eating-house, and the dishes used to come up
there from the kitchen.”
“I know,” said Randall, imitating the tone of a waiter, and bawling
down the chest—“One ox, two mocks, three bullies, and a mutton
to follow !”
“You will ruin me !” cried Briggs, in despair. “There's a very
quiet man lives down there; and my landlady is so particular, that I
shall certainly be told to go if you continue this diabolical uproar.”
But the whole affair was so novel, that Jack Randall's excitement
rose to the highest pitch ; and intimating his wish to treat the
gentleman to a little music, he seized the cornet, and blew a blast
down it, that might have been heard on the other side of the street,
and, in all probability, on the other side of the water.
THE STATISTICAL SOCIETY.
This useful body met last week, when Professor Sillyphellow read
a very interesting paper on the Moral and Physical Condition of
Omnibus Cads, in the Appendix to which there were some curious
tables. It would appear from these, that ninety-nine Cads and one-
8th out of 104 and ſº, pronounce the word “City,” as if it were
spelled Cty, without an i-which would seem to show that they are
of Welsh extraction, and have probably obtained the name of Cad
by descent from the Cad-walladers.
The Society has also prepared some curious statistical records
from a recent survey. In a parish containing 1500 houses, there are
no less than seven hundred children in arms, giving the enormous
average of nearly half a baby to each house; and in calculating the
number of street door bells, a still larger result is arrived at. Of
seven hundred and forty-two knockers, there are six hundred and
twenty out of the reach of a child, eighty-nine want fresh painting,
thirty-two are in tolerable repair, and the remaining one has been
wrenched off since the Society's last survey. Out of seven families
occupying nine rooms, four had paid their rent, two had some idea
of doing so, and the remaining one had made a point of always
running away with the goods, in anticipation of any harsh proceeding
on the part of the landlord.
How happy could I ere with ritain.
Among fourteen thousand children, eleven thousand could sing
Jim Crow, two thousand nine hundred and eighty-six could whistle
it, while the remaining fourteen had heard it, and knew it when
Played, but could not execute a note of it. There were two hundred
and twenty-four blankets to one hundred and sixteen beds ; and giv-
ing an average of three persons to each mattress, there would be # of
a pillow to every father of a family of twelve children, leaving the
mother the Pillow-case. In sixteen attics, twenty-four people were
employed in washing, eight were occupied in ironing, three had gone
out to pawn trifling articles, and one was frying sausages. The same
curious deductions have been made from the spread of Art Unions ;
for it would seem, that seven hundred and sixty-two rooms are orna-
mented with pictures, six hundred and forty of them containing por-
traits of popular performers, eighty-nine of which were decorated
with tinfoil, and seventeen were entirely plain. In a collection of
three thousand spelling-books, it was found that three-fourths of
them were Mavor's, the one-sixteenth were Dilworth's, and the re-
mainder miscellaneous. One leaf in two was dog's-eared, three in eight
were soiled, #3 in 33% were torn, and * were without any covers. Of
250,000 families, there were 249,999 that regularly purchased Punch,
and the remaining family regularly borrowed it. Out of sixteen
adults, who had all taken degrees at Oxford, four were clergymen of
the established church, six were at the bar, three were gentlemen of
independent property, and the remaining one was lying drunk at the
station-house. In a series of six-and-twenty milk jugs, one had no
handle, fourteen were without spouts, nine had been riveted, while
two were perfect. Of twenty pieces of orange-peel, lying in one
street, seventeen were from three oranges purchased at the stall at
the corner, two were left there by persons casually passing, and the
remaining one, the Society, after several hours' tedious investigation,
found no means of accounting for.
Qſìjeattital Łntelligence.
MR. FitzTEMkIN's finally retires from the stage at the end of the pre-
sent season, and is now going through the round of his principal charac-
ters at Covent Garden Theatre. The following are the definite arrange-
ments :-
Monday.—The fourth Mariner in the Tempest, and second Conspirator
in Masaniello. In the course of the week, the 17th Egyptian in Semi-
ramide, and fifth Blackleg in The Turf. And twice more his favourite
character of third Priest of the Temple of Brennus in Norma, being posi-
tively his last appearance but ninety-seven on any stage.
We cannot but regret the retirement of Fitztemkins, who is decidedly the
last of the old classic school of supernumeraries now remaining on the
stage. We, who remember the Petts, the Shegogs, and other brilliant
luminaries of the last quarter of a century, feel perhaps more for the
retirement of Fitztemkins than the majority of modern playgoers. He
was one of the original assassins in the melodrama of the Bloodstained
Bonnet, or Heaven defend the right, and his singing robbers in the
Cursed Carmelite, or the Broken Bludgeon of the Blasted Briar, will not
easily be forgotten.
A MAN of ProPERTY.
The preparations for Christmas at the Royal Banner Saloon are on an
enormous scale of splendour. There will be an original “Pantomime,”
and an entirely new butt of beer, on boxing-night; and an arrangement
has been made not only with a recognised tragedian of humble circum-
stances, but also with an acknowledged burglar of every-day life, who is
to appear in Jack Sheppard. A light comedian has been added to the
company, and a pot-boy of provincial celebrity has also been secured, that
the corps may be complete in every department. The leading lady will
make her first appearance since her late severe fine by the police-magis-
trate, and the heavy father will also return to his post after his recent
sojourn in Whitecross-street. The musical director has been busy for the
new pantomime, and his expressive music to the upsetting of a basket of
crockery is said to be a morceau which will give the lie to the base assertion
that there are no native composers to support the claims of English Opera.
On the 1st of December was presented, for the pence and praise of
the universe,
Punch's Pocket-Book for 1843.

PUNCH2S LETTERS TO HIS SON.
LETTER xxiii...—A Few LAST WORDS. PUNCH REVIEWS HIS LABOURS.
THE LOTTERY OF LIFE.
Well, my son, I now approach the end of my labours. Reflecting
upon what I have written, I feel that I may in a double sense call
myself your father. You are not merely the offspring of my loins;
but I trust, I may say, I have begotten your mind.
Yes, I have thrice scratched my head, and feel that I have
nothing more to say to you. I have now merely to contemplate—
with that delicious self-complacency which plays the divinest music
on a man's heart-strings—the beauty and excelling utility of the
labour undertaken by my parental love. I have now only to lean
back in my easy-chair, and twisting my thumbs, see, with dreaming
eyes, my beloved child playing a most prosperous part in this
eventful world. Let others call it a vale of tears; you, my son, will
walk through it with a continual chuckle. Let others groan over the
uncertainty of daily bread; you, my son, will have “your teeth white
with milk, and your eyes red with wine.” Let others look with
longing glance at pauper sixpences; you—for you have taken your
father's counsel—will know where to lay your hand upon ingots.
Consider, my son, what gratitude you owe to destiny for making
you what you are. You are the son of PUNCH. You might have
been the child of a Lord Chancellor. From your cradle you inherited
a wisdom denied to millions of others. Had you been born to finest
cambric and Brussels lace, you had never been taught the beautiful
truths of life, which it has been my paternal care to tattoo on your
adolescent mind. The son of Punch Consider, my child, the many
many million chances you had against your being this, and be
grateful for your exceeding felicity.
Mr. William Wordsworth says—
“Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting
The Soul that rises with us, our life's star,
Hath had elsewhere its setting,
And cometh from afar.”
Now, for a moment, adopting this poetical conceit, imagine the
millions of souls about to be despatched to this world, as a sort of
penal settlement, an uncomfortable half-way house, on the road to
immortal fields of asphodel. Have you seen whole clouds of
swallows congregating on the sea shore for their mysterious flight to
—where, still remains a mystery. This multitudinous fluttering of
wings can give you but the poorest idea of the gathering of human
souls, bound to earth, and “trailing clouds of glory” from the home
they are about to leave. Your finite apprehension cannot grasp the
marvel in its entirety ; yet it may do something. You see the
myriads of winged souls—you hear their fluttering : you see that
they are like one another as swallow is like to swallow ; their chirp

each has the same length of wing, the same hue of feather. These
are souls not yet provided with lodgings; they are souls, so to speak,
in the abstract. Well, swoop they come down on earth, and
like the swallows I have spoken of, take their residence in clay !
Alas and alas ! poor souls . Some are doomed to coal-pits, some
to arsenic mines, some dig in misery and darkness, some toil and toil,
and hunger and hunger; and every day is but the wretched repeti-
tion of the past. And yet with all this certain evil grinding and
crushing thousands, how few among them would consent to draw
their lot again, if Destiny were to hold forth her human lucky-bag,
to give another chance “No, no,” says the Hottentot, with a proud
downward look at his girdle of sheep's gut—“no, no ; I don't draw
again; for who knows? I might come up a Dutch boor.” “No lucky
bag for me,” cries the Esquimaux; “I might lose my delicious
whale blubber, and turning up an Englishman, be doomed to beef
and porter.” “Much obliged to you,” says the poor idiot with a
goitre at his throat as big as a football,—“I hearthere are such folks
as Patagonians; straight-limbed fellows, seven feet high; no lucky-
bag for me—I might be one of them.”

CONCLUSION OF PUNCH's LETTERS.
THE PUBLIC HEALTH.
We have made some inquiries of the vendors of meat pies, and we
find that the public appetite rose last week from *-i- ºr to 999, being
0. and a fraction above the average of the last fortnight. If we are
allowed to take from appetite our data for health, it gives us a very satis-
factory amount of salubrity during the period our calculation extends
over. The public taste has run.strongly in favour of the kidney puddings.
which is to be attributed to the foolish prejudices existing against tariff
pork and mutton, which the kidney interests have endeavoured to fan with
considerable energy.
ARISTOCRATIC MOVEMENTS.
Lond Hunt INgrowen left the Queen's Bench prison last week for
the Court of Bankruptcy. After a long interview with the Com-
missioner, his Lordship returned to his residence.
Lord George Loftus paid a visit to the Insolvent Court. His Lord-
ship did not retire until he had made himself practically acquainted
with some of the forms in which justice is administered in the Court
alluded to.
Count Bathyany and the Earl of Chesterfield visited the Court of
Chancery. These distinguished noblemen entered with great spirit
into the proceedings, and put a very interesting question to the Judge
who presided there.
The Earl of Waldegrave is on a tour, and is understood to be
studying the intricate theory of Outlawry.

THE FüRST OF FURSTENBERG.
EINRICH, the Fürst of Fürsten-
berg was most princely in debt.
Accordingly, having the choice of
two evils—either to be imprisoned
or married for life—he chose the
smaller one, and married. He
thought it more agreeable to be a
prisoner upon parole, by giving
himself up to matrimony, instead
of being held in durance vile for
Hº: the natural term of his existence,
=º Encº-E
- - tº- by the tyranny of his creditors.
The Fürst of Fürstenberg had his standing army; he was com-
pelled to contribute his complement of armed force to the Germanic
Confederation; he had the privilege of coining his own money
(though this was a privilege he very judiciously abstained from
abusing); no less than sixteen quarterings emblazoned his coat of
arms; and, with these distinctions, it cannot be much wondered at,
if, after he had conferred them upon his wife, by allowing her to
share them with him, he should think more of the honour he had
paid her, than of the money she had paid him for it. Of his wife,
since the day he had, by the gift of his hand, changed her from an
obscure Fraulein into the most envied Fürstin of the kingdom, he
had seen but little ; nor, from the perseverance he displayed in not
wishing to disturb the privacy of the Princess, did it seem that he
was anxious to improve the acquaintance his marriage-day had
introduced him to.
One evening—one rare evening—when he happened to be at home,
Fritz, his confidential talet, who had grown grey in his devotion to
the Fürstenberg family, said to him, “Herr Graf, I am sorry to
cause you any uneasiness—but I think it is my duty to tell you what
is going on here.”
“Well, Fritz, what is the matter?” said the Graf with the most
unfeigned indifference. “I know I shall hurt your feelings, my
worthy Herr Graſ-but the fact of it is, that, whenever your Graf-
ship leaves the Castle, your Grafship's back is no sooner turned, than
in comes a young Abbot"—
.<= *==
Dogging his strºps.
“Well, Fritz, and what then t”
“The Countess is always uneasy when he is not with her, and is
writing letters to him the whole day long. The servants declare that—”
The Graf stopped him in the progress of his revealment. He had
heard enough. However, it was a matter he could not overlook—
his honour was at stake—and he was bound, little as he cared for his
wife, to take some notice of the affair. Before coming forward, how-
ever, he thought it better to be armed with some positive proof ol
the fact.
“Couldn't you procure me one of these letters, Fritz "
“Nothing easier, mein Graft They fly backwards and forwards at
all hours of the day. I can promise you one for your breakfast to-
morrow morning.”
The first letter written by the Countess to the young Abbot was
intercepted, and served up to the Count with his chocolate in the
morning. This letter, exceedingly long, was full of the most violent
passion, and the Count, as soon as he had read it, was in a state very
similar to it. His first impulse was to rush to his wife's bed-room,
and to demand an explanation. His honour was involved by this
intrigue, and yet he disliked raising the scandal of the neighbourhood;
so reflection suggested another plan, and, instead of confronting the
compromiser of his ancestral honour, he proceeded quietly to the
residence of the young Abbot.
“I have learnt, Sir,”—the Count said to him—“not without consi-
derable surprise, that you are in the habit of paying repeated visits
to the Fürstin of Fürstenberg, though, on my honour, I have not the
pleasure of knowing you. Nevertheless, I am inclined to believe,
from the nature of your profession, that you are the most gallant
man in the world; and so much good nature inspires me with the
hope that you will not hesitate to comply with my demand, and will
at once hand me over the letters you have received from the Fürstin,
forming the whole of the correspondence you have lately held with
my faithful and loving wife. I do not intend to bring them against
her as evidence of her guilt. The matter, I promise you, shall be
buried in the deepest secrecy; but only on the condition that you
instantly leave the country, and return to me every one of the letters
you have received from her.” -
“But I am not aware, Sir, of whom you are speaking ;”—at last
said the young Abbot. “I never had the signal honour, I can assure
you, of being in correspondence with the Fürstin of Furstenberg.”
The Count insisted, and the young Abbot only the more stoutly
denied the assertion.
“Name any sum you like,” said the Count. “Here, Ioffer you twelve
thousand francs; and I will thank you in return to sacrifice your
love, and to hand me over the many affectionate proofs my wife has
given you of hers;” and, suiting the action to the word, the Count
displayed upon the table the sum mentioned in twelve bank-notes of
a thousand francs each.
GETTING RiD or the BLUNT.
The young Abbot appeared to spurn the prodigal offer. The Count
pressed more urgently than before, counted out another thousand
francs, and the letters, after some deliberation, were at last given in
exchange for the bank-notes. Choosing opportunely the moment
when his wife was alone, he burst into the room, and threw upon the
table the packet he had paid so dearly for, not without explaining,
with greater warmth and irritation than he had agreed with himself
to display, the agreeable way in which it had fallen into his
possession.
“Your collection is imperfect, Count,” interposed his affectionate
wife with the greatest effrontery, scarcely before he had concluded
his angry tirade—“take this one I have just finished; it will com-
plete the series.”
And she handed him a letter, of which the signature was not
yet dry.
“D–n it ! madam, have you the indecency to justify your conduct?”
violently exclaimed the Count.
“Certainly, Count.”
“What I madam, against these proofs "
“Yes, Count, against those proofs even, as you are pleased to call
them; for those proofs shall be the very documents of my proud
acquittal.”
The Count sat quietly down, for he was beaten out of the contest
by the immovable coolness of his wife, and waited with no small
degree of impatience to hear what ingenious fabrication she could
weave, to extricate herself out of her criminal position.
But, alas! it was all true—too true. The Count could not gainsay
a single word; and he threw himself round his wife's neck, like a
child that implores pardon for some offence it has been detected in:
This quarrel was the first occasion the Count had ever busied himself
about his wife; and from that hour he learned to appreciate the many
qualities that adorned her, and sought his happiness and society for
the future in the charms of her he had too long neglected.
The mystery was very simple. It had grown out of the following
circumstances:—The Count was a great linguist; but, of all living
languages, he had devoted a marked preference to the study of
English. He was well acquainted with all our poets. His greatest
pleasure was to read English—his greatest enjoyment to speak it.
The Countess, jealous to please him, had locked herself up since
several months in order to master the difficulties of Lindley Murray
The young Abbot, whose acquaintance she had made from his coming
to administer to her spiritual wants, used to assist her in this secret
undertaking. The billets—the violence of whose passion had alarmed
the Count—were a literal translation from an old English romance ;
written, like Pamela, in a series of letters, which had been borrowed
for the purpose from the Count's own library.

THE MEDICAL STUDENTS.

chapTER v III.-HOW M. R. SIMPSON BRIGGS LEFT HIS LODGINGs.
HE only way to keep Jack Ran-
dall at all quiet was to give him
something to eat and drink.
Begging him, therefore, to re-
strain his musical and harmonic
propensities whilst he called for
the servant, he sent her out for
some coffee and bloaters, which
he hoped would keep Jack's
mouth somewhat tranquil by
completely filling it. He then
produced a machine, bearing
some resemblance to a tin band-
box, which he placed with great
importance on the table.
“What the devil's that 1.”
asked Jack.
“A Bachelor's Despatch, "
replied Mr. Briggs. “This will
- roast, boil, bake, stew, steam,
heat flat-irons, melt butter, cook eggs, toast bread, and diffuse a
genial warmth, all at once, with a ha'porth of brown paper.”
“That's your sort,” said Jack, “let it off then.”
But this was not so easily done; for Randall, in his hilarity, had
poured some beer into the box of lucifers, which was somewhat
against their lighting ; and after several vain attempts, he proposed
borrowing some of Mr. Spiff underneath. But Mr. Spiff did not
chance to be at home, so that Mr. Briggs, who knew he kept his
lucifers on the top of a bureau, opened the chest of communication,
and fished down it with a pair of tongs, finally producing the
desired matches, after having in turns brought up some lobster's
shells, a pewter go (which, if everybody had their own, would pos-
sibly have belonged to Mr. Rhodes), and then something which was
very like a woman's cap. Fire was then produced, and the
“despatch” set in action-brown paper being discarded from not
having any, and the want of it clandestinely supplied by Jack, partly
from the notes Mr. Briggs had taken at lectures; and partly from
some hay which he secretly pulled out of the old easy-chair. The
coffee arrived, and the breakfast was made, our friends laying the
cloth on the top of the chest, because the table was covered with
articles of study and recreation—books, pipes, inkstands, pewter-
pots, and tobacco-jars.
“Jack,” said Mr. Briggs, mysteriously to his companion, when
their hunger was somewhat appeased, “Jack, I want to tell you
something.”
“Out with it, then,” replied Randall.
“But you'll laugh 1”
“No, I won't—honour.”
“Well, then,” resumed Briggs, with some hesitation, “I think
I'm in love.”
Jack Randall finished cramming the tails of the herrings into the
bowl of Mr. Briggs's pipe, in which occupation he had been quietly
engaged ; and, looking the other steadfastly in the face, exclaimed—
Gammon, Simmy Who ever heard of a Medical Student being
in love 1°
“I'm afraid. I am, though,” replied Mr. Briggs, with a sigh.
“Such a nice little girl —quite well conducted and respectable.”
“Oh, of course—of course,” replied Jack. “Where did you
meet her 1"
“On the top of Primrose-hill, last Sunday; all amongst the nuts
and bull's-eyes. She keeps a bonnet shop in Cranbourn-alley. I
bought one of her own bonnets, and made her a present of it.”
“More fool you,” said Jack, briefly.

move.
“Not at all,” replied Simpson, half angry. “I gave her a hand:
kerchief, besides, with a Union Jack on it—a flag, you know.”
“I know,” said Jack. “The wizard at the theatre had one, that
went here, there, everywhere, and nowhere, all at once.”
And here Randall caught up the tea-caddy, and was going to show
Mr. Briggs some necromantic performances thereon, when the lid of
the chest which formed their table was suddenly elevated, the whole
of the breakfast equipage shot off upon the ground, and the head of
Mr. Spiff, perfectly unconscious of the confusion he had created,
appeared in the box, quietly asking—
“I say, Briggs, have you got my lucifers "
Jack Randall went off at once into a roar of laughter, and Mr.
Briggs got exceedingly irate. He thrust the lucifers into Spiff's
hand without saying a word—for, indeed, he was somewhat over-
come at the sudden chute; and, putting down the lid almost before
the head of the intruder was out of the way, sat down upon it, and
contemplated the ruin around him.
“Never mind,” said Jack, with noble philosophy; “let us set to
work and pick up the things; we can make all straight in two
minutes.”
And in his laudable attempt to absorb the coffee spilt on the chest
and floor, he pulled out a large flag handkerchief to wipe it up,
which he had no sooner displayed, than Briggs uttered a cry of
terror, and exclaimed—
“I say, Jack 1 where did you get that 1."
“Oh,” said Randall, laughing with the most wicked fun; “A
young lady gave it to me—quite well conducted and respectable—
keeps a bonnet shop in Cranbourne-alley. Imet her on Primrose-hill.”
“What a horrid occurrence 1" exclaimed Briggs, pale with asto-
nishment. “That's the very handkerchief I gave my sweetheart l”
“What a joke l’” replied Randall, laughing. “Now, come, I
don't want to cross your love : we'll toss up who shall pay his
addresses to her.”
“I’m sure I shall do no such thing,” said Briggs, whose dignity
was quite offended.
“Well, then, we'll fight for her hand, like the knights of old,”
continued Jack.
“I can't fight, and I won't,” replied Briggs.
“Yes, you can. I don't mean with fists, you know ; bolsters are
the things.”
And in an instant this vivacious gentleman had pulled open the
turn-up bedstead, and dragged a pillow and bolster from its depths.
“Now, come on,” said Jack. “I’ll keep the pillow, and there's the
bolster for you. The long odds are on your side.”
“I tell you I won't fight,” said Briggs, getting near the window,
which was open.
“Pshaw! come on," cried Randall; and hurling the pillow at Briggs,
who stooped to avoid it, it went right through the window, knocking
away the regiment of flower-pots, which immediately fell into the
street, and an awful smash was the result.
“There—you have been and done it,” cried Briggs, “that's the last
The flower-pots have fallen on the china and glass stall;
you've broken a pound's worth of crockery, and we haven't got half-a-
crown to pay for it.”
“I beg your pardon there,” said the imperturbable Randall, “I
think we've got a good deal to pay for it.”
“Well, this is a settler 1" cried Briggs. “I’m off, at all hazards.”
And seizing a carpet-bag, from a peg, he rapidly began to cram his
things into it. Two minutes had scarcely elapsed, before a noise was
heard of people ascending the stairs, Jack divined their business, and
immediately bolted the door, as one of the assailants knocked at it.
“Where's Mr. Briggs 1" cried a voice outside, which sounded very
like a policeman's.
“You can't see him,” cried Jack in return.
putting some leeches on him.”
“But I saw this pillow fall down upon the glass, from his room,”
said the voice.
“No, no,” returned Jack. “It's a mistake, it came from the
floor above.”
At this instant a horn sounded in the street, and Briggs ran to the
window. “I knew it,” he cried ; “it’s the Southampton railway bus.
If I can but get out I am saved.”
“Get down the chest,” said Randall, “I think everybody in the
house is up here on the landing.”
“Open the door,” cried the voices.
“Wait an instant till the leeches come off,” said Jack, in reply.
“We will break it open,” cried the invaders.
“Do if you dare,” said Jack ; and pushing the turn-up bedstead
against it, he blew a fearful note of defiance on his cornet.
“He’s ill in bed—I'm

The crisis had arrived ; Mr. Briggs, in the short interim, had
crammed all his effects into his fishing-basket and carpet-bag; the
beauty of which latter article is, that it is never so full but you can
put something else in. Begging a rapid pardon for the intrusion, he
threw his things down into Spiff's room, and followed by Randall, de-
scended after them, letting the lid close over their heads. In another
minute, he had gained the street unopposed; for, as Jack had suspected,
all the people of the house were up on the landing outside their door.
The omnibus was at the end of the street; a short run enabled him to
overtake it, and plunge into the seclusion of its interior; and Jack
Randall, after telling Mr. Spiff he should be happy to serve him in a

left all effects they could find for the benefit of his creditors, also took

USEFUL KNOWLEDGE. READ ! MARK! LEARN
*~~~~
private tuition.
WE have always advocated the dissemination of useful knowledge,
with a view to the promotion of morality. By useful knowledge we
mean, the length of the tails, ears, and snouts of various animals, the
distance between the Earth and Georgium Sidus, the way to make
pins and needles, and the like sort of information, from which we
derive so much assistance in the daily transactions of life, such
incitements to virtue, and such comfort and support in the hour of
trial.
Various modes in which we might contribute to the destultification
and good of our fellow-creatures, have occurred to us; and of these
we will instance a few, just to see what our readers think of them.
It has occurred to us, in the first place, that many a mind might be
advantageously stimulated to reflection, by truths not exactly novel,
but newly put. For example,
“WATER.
“Water is a natural production, for which we are principally in-
debted to pumps. It is found in large quantities in long hollows or
channels in the earth, denominated rivers, which communicate with
a great hole or cavity, commonly called a sea. Sea water is salt.—
because it is : this, at least, is the opinion of the cleverest chemists.
River water is for the most part fresh, though it often contains a deal
of mud, and is sometimes much polluted with dead cats and other
impurities, especially in the neighbourhood of large towns. More-
over, it is occasionally impregnated with cocculus indicus and lime ;
but the admixture is artificial, and usually perpetrated by poachers
with an eye to trout. Water is also met with in inland fresh water
seas or lakes, of the largest of which the Serpentine, viewed through
the grand imaginative microscope, will give an excellent idea. It is
likewise contained in a smaller sort of lakes called ponds, of which
there are various kinds, as fish-ponds, mill-ponds, horse-ponds; so
that each of these is a sort of a kind of a lake. It abounds, too, in
gutters, puddles, and sinks, wherein, however, it seldom exists in a
perfectly pure state. In little pearly gems, called dew-drops, it
adorns “the rose on a summer's morning,” and also the cabbage, the
cauliflower, and vegetable world in general. Rain is water, even
when it rains cats and dogs; hail, snow, and ice, are confections of
the same fluid. .
“Water, holding in solution chloride of sodium, and a few other
things, is eliminated by the lachrymal gland of the human eye, in the
shape of tears. Philosophers have calculated that the quantity of
water which has been produced in this way since the beginning of
the world, would suffice for another deluge. Tear-water may readily
be obtained by a very pretty experiment. Take a small boy without
friends, and pinch him hard by the ear, till he cries. Or serve a writ
on a poor widow, or trifle with the affections of a young lady.
“Water, in combination with soap, especially the Brown Windsor
variety of that substance, has strong abstergent properties; this
truth, though generally known, is not so universally acted on as it
ought to be. In some climates water is the principal beverage of
man, and in this country it is largely consumed in the unmixed state,
in gaols and union-workhouses. In private dwellings, however,
and taverns, where hydrophobia generally prevails more or less, it is
for the most part qualified by alcohol of various kinds, sugar, and
yº. Tha;
A cortion AL wish.
sometimes lemon. It enters into the composition of beer, and often
much too largely, particularly when that liquor is fetched by a boy,
who in returning with it from the public-house, passes near a pump.
“The consumption of water has been much increased of late by
Priessnitz and Father Mathew ; the former of whom administers it
to seedy people as if they were plants. Whether it is as effectual to
throw cold water on a disease as it is to throw it on a joke ; whether
an inflammation in a chest and a conflagration in a warehouse are to
be extinguished in the same way; whether county fire-offices and
county hospitals should be consolidated, and the parish doctor should
take charge of the parish engine—are questions too intricate for dis-
cussion here.”
We have also thought, that the inventive faculty might be pressed
into the service of the schoolmaster, and that geniuses with a turn for
fiction, but a distaste for dry study, might thus, for instance, turn
their talents to account.
“TIN.
“Tin is a metal much in request, particularly by poor authors. It
is imported in large quantities from Constantinople, where it is ob-
tained from the bed of the Bosphorus by Christian captives, who go
down for the purpose in a diving-bell. They bring it up in wicker
baskets, and their pockets are carefully searched lest they should
have fraudulently concealed any. Tin, however, fresh from the
Bosphorus, is not in the state in which we commonly see it. It exists
in the form of an ore, of which there are two species; one denomi-
nated grautracke, which is grey and gritty, the other kickobs, of a softer
consistence, brownish colour, and exhaling, when heated, an odour
which the curious have compared to that of mutton-cutlets. These
substances are exposed to a strong heat in a covered crucible;
one with date-stones and yellow ochre, the other with pomegranate
seeds and mahogany sawdust. The ore is thus reduced, and the
melted metal is let off by a stop-cock, and runs into wild boar-skins
prepared for its reception, which, with their contents, are known
in commerce by the name pigs of tin. The New Tariff is said to have
nearly doubled the importation of these pigs since it has been in
operation.”
Now if any philosopher should object, that the above is a tissue of
nonsense from beginning to end, let him reflect, that the progress of
discovery renders that which is one day science, stuff the next ; and,
therefore, that knowledge is equally useful morally, whether real or
imaginary, provided people know no better. Would the foregoing
piece of mineralogy be less likely to make a mechanic eschew gin
and leave off beating his wife, than a paragraph in the Penny Ma-
gazine !
