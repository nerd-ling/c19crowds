​R. PUNCH presents this, his THIRTIETH VOLUME, as a Peace-offering to the Nations. The Book is
to be received as printed upon palm-leaves ; carrying words of wisdom smooth as oil, wholesome as
corn, and strong as wine.
MR. Punch has to acknowledge the courtesy of the EARL OF CLARENDON. That urbane and sagacious
nobleman, with an alacrity charming to contemplate in the statesman nature, has charged himself with the
pleasant (and henceforth historical) duty of forwarding to all English Ambassadors a special copy of this,
Mr. Punch's, THIRTIETH VOLUME; to be by them duly presented to the Emperors, Kings, and Potentates
upon whose Courts they cast the radiance of their delegated wisdom. The Ambassadors aforesaid are, more-
over, charged to read the whole of the contents of the offered Book, from the first page to the last, to
the imperial, royal, or otherwise governing individual ; and further, to dwell upon the manifold beauties and
significances dwelling in the abounding illustrations, like tints and odours in flowers, and pearls in shells,-
to the end and purpose that the governing mind, haply to its own astonishment, may become uplifted and
harmonised to the highest labours and the noblest utterances. MR. Punch has calculated that, two hours
a day will, in a month, suffice to pour out the contents of the Volume into even the smallest and densest
crowned head hitherto visible to the naked eye of the subject. In one month, if the Hon. W. TEMPLE
does true reader's duty, the KING OF NAPLES will be so improved, that the dearest of his lazzaroni will not
know him. Incontinently, a bomb-shell will have been mollified into a melon!
The EMPEROR ALEXANDER, seated under his own fir-tree, will give attentive ear to the written sayings
of Punch; and bending his contemplative eye-balls on the sermons, graphic in wood, will become pacific as
a stock-dove; to the end that he may ever after live well and die happy.
To the EMPRESS EUGÉNIE, for the earliest reading of her son and France's present heir, Mr. PUNCH
sends a choice copy. If the good and beautiful Empress and Mother will only teach baby his letters from

PREFACE.
the pages of Mr. Punch; if she will but condescend to unfold his rose-bud mind, by awakening in the
infant brain emotions of wonder, delight and merriment “from the pictures,”-future France may recognise
a benefactress in EUGÉNIE, and something better than a PEPIN in her little boy.

LORD STRATFORD DE REDCLIFFE will only too readily undertake the reading of Punch to the Sultan.
His Lordship, it is said, is not a very punctual letter-writer ; but he reads unfailingly, sonorously as a
Muezzin calls from the minaret. (Note. Mr. Punch has to inform the Sultan, that he waives his right of
translation into Turkish.)
Sir Hamilton Seymour may, or may not, as he thinks best, read Mr. Punch's Volume to FRANCIS-
JOSEPH. It is, however, to be feared that for the present the young man's ears are so full of lamb’s-wool
shorn by the nuns of St. AGNES, and dyed a Roman scarlet from the Kalendar, that not even Punch can
search LORD ABERDEEN'S “hope," and other men's hopelessness, of Austria.
Of course, a Volume has been specially bound for VICTOR-EMMANUEL, who will be pleased to receive
with the Copy, Mr. Punch's distinguished consideration.
1
A Copy will remain with the EARL OF CLARENDON to be despatched by him with the new British
Ambassador to the United States ; always supposing that throughout Great Britain may be discovered that
favoured individual in whose mind shall centre all that moral excellence, that intellectual delicacy, so rigorously
demanded by the high standard set forth and exemplified by JONATHAN himself. It is to be hoped that
our Ambassador will not have to read his Punch to MR. PIERCE; for Mr. Punch would as soon endeavour
to transform hickory into cinnamon, or talk Jim Crow into John Swan, as hope to move PIERCE a P
from IERCE. No: the President for the time being defies the influence of all humane letters. In the
ferocity of his patriotism, PIERCE would grin the very bark off the Tree of Knowledge.
In a little month from the delivery of his Volumes, Mr. Punca has a lively belief that the world
will feel the benignant influence of his teaching through its civilised and regenerated rulers. In the mean-
time, the Briton will be pleased to feel duly proud with the conviction of the fact that Mr. Punch as the
Schoolmaster, is Abroad, and that even crowned heads are made to listen to him. Every crowned head,
too, like every medal, has its reverse. If MR. Punch can twine the bay, can he not also bind the birch?

PUNCH'S ALMANACK FOR 1856.
FACTS FOR JANUARY.
NATURAL HISTORY.
On the ninth of January 1844, a young
English traveller in America had taken
nis gun and strayed into the backwoods
in quest of sport. After some hours of
vandering, he came upon a beaver pond,
und beheld the sagacious animals that
iad reared the dam, swimming in all di-
'ections. He prepared to fire, but they
nstantly dived, and eluded his aim. The
argest beaver lingered last, and stroking
iis own glossy skin with his ample tail,
lily remarked, as he sank, “How's your
latter?"
15th. Furze blossoms open for the season.
Several birds issue in this month their
irst notes. The Wren's first note is due
in the 5th, and the Marsh Titmouse is
suilty of uttering on the 16th.
In the time of QUEEN ANNE a mad ass
vas baited on New Year's Day, in the pre-
ence of a number of insane donkeys.
FACTS FOR FEBRUARY.
ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY.
The third of the month is dedicated to
St. BLAZIUS. lle was greatly celebrated
for his hospitality, and, as a bishop, ex-
cited some scandal by inviting persons
who were going to church on a cold morning
to come into his house on their way, and
warm themselves. Henco came the phrases
"going to Blazius, or blazes," and the
vulgar reply to the statement that one has
been to church_“Yes, a church with a
chimney in it."
On the 6th of February, 1756, the shops
were shut up on account of recent earth-
quakes. A few Quakers, who refused to
join the earthquakers, were fined.
On the 13th of February, 1756, the fleet
of the pirate A NGRIA was taken. Be was
much irritated by his loss, and among the
prisoners was the wile of A xoria, which,
although he lost his self-possession, made
him ANGRIA stiu.

MORAL FOB JANUARY.
jaxon or Welshman, Scot or Celt,
Name, by right name, this month so
merry.
Pronounce it just as it is spelt,
And never call it Janniwerry.
MORAL FOR FEBRUARY
Get born upon Feb. 29,
For Leap years come but one in four;
A toast 's a thing that spoils one's wine
You save three-fourths of birthday bore.
- The
!
HINT ON EVENING PARTIES.- A young
ady, after dancing all night and several
hours longer, will generally find, on con-
ulting the looking-glass, that the even-
ng's amusement will not bear the morn-
og's reflection.
HILARY TERM is named from St. Hilary,
1 celebrated arguer, who has been adopted
y the lawyers, because after proving black
vas white, he could still go on arguing" till
ill was blue."
WINTER ADVICE TO YOUNG LADIES.-
Chin shoes lead to damp feet; damp feet
yring on a cough; a cough may terminate
n a coffin.
MORAL EFFECT OF SICKNESS.—During
onvalescence every patient is sure to be
loing well.
SEVERITY OF THE SEASON.-Russia takes
cold, and tallows her own nose.
ADVICE FOR NEW YEAR'S DAY.–Never
neglect the Present.
A MELANCHOLY ACCIDENT.
"Speaking Machine," that made such a
noise in London a few years back, has lost
its voice from indiscreetly attempting to
pronounce the names of the Russian com-
manders, whilst it had a cold in the head!
A TEMPERANCK Notion.-Wly is a sot
so generally called a drunken dog? Is it
not by reason of the habit which must dogs
have, of getting under the table ?
The PiliLOSOPHY OF SMOKING.-Fast
young men smoke a great deal, for it is
the nature of a Rake to have a quantity
of Weeds about him.
TUE CHACE.—The season of 1856, being
Leap year, will doubtless be memorable in
the annals of fox-bunting.
THE WORLD'S OPIxion.- A mean man is
a person with a small income who lives
within it.
IRISH DEVELOPEMENT. – Pat and his
whiskey resemble each other; they come
out to most advantage in “ hot water."
FOR A COLD IN THE HEAD, THERE IS NOTHING LIKE A STEAM BATH, AND THIS CAN BE HAD
IN YOUR OWN BEDROOM WITH THE GREATEST EASE.—YOU HAVE ONLY TO-

IWA
TAKE GARE THAT YOU MANAGE THE APPARATUS PROPERLY.

PUNCH’S ALMANACK FOR 1856.
MORAL FOR MARCU.
A BUSHEL of March-winnow'd dust
Is worth, they say, a monarch's ransom;
Let BOMBA save it-mobs don't trust;
For such a life such prico were handsome.

FACT FOR MARCH.
ENGLISH HISTORY
On the eighteenth we commemorate
EDWARD, King of the West Saxons. His
character presented a singular compound,
and he was himself fond of a singular com-
pound of methlegin, woad, and mangel
worzel, which he used to mingle in a bowl
before all his court, facetiously declaring,
that he liked to mix in company. To him
is attributed a saying, now confined to the
most stupid vulgar. At one of his orgies,
there was but a single pine torch lighted,
at which he was incensed. A courtier re-
marked, that though the guests were in
the dark, there was light enough for the
monarch. EDWARD imperiously replied,
“ Throw a little light upon the subiect."

NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.-A veterinary
surgeon, whose commission will bear date
the First
of April, is about to be appointed
to every Regiment of Horse Marines.
HIGH ART.-The highest specimens of
Art in London are undoubtedly SIR JAMES
THORNHILL's paintings in the dome of St.
Paul's.
HAPPY LAND.-An ingenuous youth said,
be should like to go to school in Scotland,
because he understood it was the Land of
Cakes.
CONTAGION.-Several young ladies who
were accustomed to sit under a popular
preacher, became, consequently, much
affected.
MOOR'S MELODIES.-The cry of the
grouse, the bark of the dogs, the crack of
the guns.
CHEMISTRY FOR LADIES.-Beef contains
nitrogen as well as oxygen.
A BRIEF ACQUAINTANCE,—That or the
Barrister with his Client.
Wuat games could never be brought to
sixes and sevens? All-Fours and Fives.
How TRADESMEN SHOULD SERVE THEIR
CUSTOMERS.-With civility, without ser-
vility.
DEFINITION FOR TAE BAND OF HOPE.-
A Teetotaller is a person who eats his toast
instead of drinking it.
MEN AND INSECTS.—The Ant subsists
by its own industry; the Uncle by that of
other people.
POLITICAL PARADOX.-Acts of Parlia-
ment will afford increased provisions, but
not food.
BEWABE of the officious friend. He is
the too well-meaning man, who in the
pathway of the early bird would strew
worm-lozenges.
THE EGLANTINE IN BLOOM.-A fox-
hunter has remarked, that he should say
the flower of all others with the finest
scent was the dog-rose.
SACKCLOTH AND ASHES. - A London
Alderman was heard to remark, that he
didn't so much mind living upon hasbes
during Lent, but that as for the sackcloth,
he'd only take the first half of it.
The affectionate heart thinks it good to
have two strings to its beau ; the volatile,
two beaux to its string. (Punch to the fair
reader. Affectionate or volatile ?)
It is not impossible that the Mor-
monites may dorive their name from the
fact, that some of them have Mor(e)-
mon-ey than wit.
The Most IIONOURABLE ORDEB OY TAR
BATH.–To order a Bath, and pay for it at
the time of giving the Order.
Good luck will drive hedge-hogs to
market, and when he gets 'em there, will
find 'em all guinea-pigs.
GARDENING DIRECTIONS.—Put Venus's
Looking-Glass into a Frame.
LIOGRAPHICAL.-SIR ISAAC NEWTON Was
never married. He thought more of
Saturn's ring than Hymen's.
SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM. If electricity
annihilates time, how about the electric
clock?
A NOVEL CONUNDRUM.-Why is a vacant
Episcopal See like a new Novel? Because
"the right of Translation is reserved."
HINT ON HEALTH.–For air and exercise
too many young ladies resort almost exclu-
sively to the piano.

PUNCH'S ALMANACK FOR 1856.
A CLEVER DOG.
Much as has been
recorded of the saga-
city of the canine spe-
cies, the remark has
never hitherto been
made, that the dog
ill often, with very
little training, assume
quite the character of
an artist, for a terrier
has often been known
to draw a badger.
MERCANTILE.
The principal Lon-
don Market for Chaft
is Billingsgate, and
not, as might have
been expected, in
Mark Lane.

MORAL FOR APRIL.
THE First's & day
when folks are
sold
By gamesome youth
released from
school;
Neither at that time,
render bold,
Nor any other, be a
Fool.
OUD
ADULTERATION OF
Food. - A Cockney
wag of uncultivated
Aspirations was heard
to say, that bakers'
bread reminded him
of the Middle Ages:
because he always
associated the idea of
it with IIALLAM.
In this month na-
ture begins to smile,
and the lnds to burst
out laughing, after the
dulness of winter,
The birds once more
present their bills,
and their notes are

FACT FOR APRIL-CONVENTUAL HISTORY.
The nineteenth is the day of Archbishop ALPHEGE or
ALLFUDGE. He was an exceedingly learned man, a scholar
and & gentleman, and his intimate acquaintance with the
classical languages enabled him, when only an archdeacon, to
launch the most abusive execrations at his stupid superiors,
while they thought he was reading some ancient author to
them, at dinner-time, as usual in the convent. A very long
thin, narrow, spoon, was once held up to him by his Abbot,
EXTEMPORANEOUS COOKERY.-A policeman descended an
area, was admitted into the kitchen, and finding nothing else
there to allay his hunger, collared an eel.

SAINT GEORGE, the patron saint of England, began life, we
are told, as a dealer in bacon; and this being the case, his name
would be more appropriately associated with the hog in
armour than with the green dragon. Having commenced
business as a pork butcher, it is strange that he should have
become a Bishop; but his destruction of a dragon was not
incompatible with his labours in pursuit of sausage-meat. He
may be said to have met his death after the manner of his
own trade, for the people tore him to pieces.

ST. DUNSTAN is commemorated on the
nineteenth. It is not generally known,
that there were two saints of this name,
so much alike that they were always
tumbling over one another's miracles, and
generally getting into muddles. At last
the more intelligent of the two purchased
for himself a very splendid waistcoat, in
which he appeared upon all occasions, re-
marking, “There can be no mistake now,
as everybody can see I am Sr. DUNSTAN

wear a moustache because they imagine in

ECONOMY IN BEATING CARPETS.– When
you purchase your Carpets, take care to buy
one that is infinitely superior to all the rest;

present MR. DOBBS with a silver cake-
basket, and Mrs. DOBBs, (it is the com-
plaint of D.) will ruin him in giving parties
to show it. - Beware of testimonials.
HOPE FOR YOUNG BEGINNERS.- All
things are possible to perseverance. Mr.
Punch once knew a spider that resolved
to spin nothing short of whipcord, and the
spider did it.
ASTRONOMICAL.- Venus is seen without
a Coronet, and influenza attacks a foreign
crowned head. Let the sister of KING
BOMBA look to it.

over it. This would
make it quite a busi-
ness transaction, and
would give each scene
the character of an advertising supplement to the large Brobdignagian
sheet of advertisements at present exhibited as a curtain at Covent
Garden Theatre.
A CHRISTMAS FABLE
OF JOHN BULL AND THE THIEVISH BEAR.
For Grown Children.
John BULL was an orderly citizen,
Who lived in a quiet street,
With a force of Police to keep the peace,
And each warn rogues off his beat.
He hated strife; for a quiet life
Rates and taxes no end he paid ;
Nor starved his servants, nor thrash'd his wife,
But stuck to his shop and his trade.
He was rather selfish it must be own'd,
In his hatred of beggars and noise ;
'Gainst their woes he'd parade his thriving trade,
'Gainst their jars his family joys.
To foreign distress would have nought to say,
And when ask'd for relief would be bearish,
With a “ Heav'n
helps those who help themselves,”
And “ If they're hard up, there's the Parish."
He had moved on no end of Italian boys,
Snubb’d Hungarian minstrels sturdy;
All Marseillaises he had sent to blazes,
On French horn or hurdy-gurdy.
Not a penny he'd stand to a German band,
But bid them be hang'd with their jangle
Of drum and trombone, and Saxophone,
Cornet, ophicleide, and triangle.
In his own snug parlour, well-lit and warm,
He thought little of garret or vault;
"I made my own way,” he was apt to say,
"If they can't, it's their own fault."
Thirty years John spent in this selfish content,
Thought nothing could trouble his quiet,
Till eighteen 'fifty-four to John's peaceable door
Brought trouble and row and riot.
A rogue there was by the name of ROMANOFF,
Who went about with a bear,
A surly brute, but with scent só acute
He poked his nose everywhere.
That thing was not too heavy or hot,
For him to hug, and swallow.
Spite of muzzle and pole, he snapp'd and he stole,
Though owners might rage and holloa.
All sorts of meat the brute would eat,
Ne'er was burglary, but you'd find him in it.
And his appetite, inordinate quite,
Was perfectly indiscriminate,
The tallow-melter, would come helter-skelter,
For aid of the tardy police;
Pounds on pounds of his tallow the bear would swallow,
There was nothing he loved like Grease.
If got rid of thence, on his master's pretence,
That of theft the brute didn't dream,
The next moment he'd drop on the hairdresser's shop,
And bolt his Circassian cream.
The unhappy furriers couldn't find barriers
To keep him from nibbling their skins,
And e'en the fishmonger paid toll to his hunger,
He so doated on Sound and Fins.
In default of meat, even physic he'd eat,
When he'd nothing else to be arter;
And once on a chemist he made the grimmest
Assault, for some cream of Tartar.
But those who know what that drug will do,
Might have said with voice prophetic,
That however pleasant it seem'd at present,
At last 'twould prove Tartar-emetic.
Nay, rather than starve, the brute would carve
His way through stones and slabs
To a fruiterer's vault, and make assault
On a store of Siberian crabs.
And for want of a dish of flesh or fish,
In a drying-ground fence he'd make holes;
Where he'd frighten the women, and tear up the linen,
And then take to grinding the Poles.
All this John BULL heard, without a word,
Still less an act of resistance ;
""Twas no matter of his, if Bear took that or this,
He couldn't render assistance.
He was forced to stop and look after his shop,
Had no time to spare from his business;
The Bear might be about, he didn't doubt,
But it didn't cause him uneasiness."
'Till one fine day, Bear took his way
To John Bull's city-quarter,
Where a poulterer's board was temptingly stored
With fowls for Christmas slaughter.
There, flower of the flock, prime bird of the stock,
With red wattles, and plumage murky
Abroad display'd, was temptingly laid,
An old, but still toothsome Turkey!
On his way past the shop, JOHN ('tis whisperd), would stop,
And his chops had been seen to be licking;
And folks have said, that what ran in his head,
Was : "Lord, there's bones for picking!”
However heroic, Joun wasn't a Stoic;
He may have wish'd he own'd it;
Bat whatever he thought, he never bought
The Turkey, much less boned it.
Not so the Bear; since the bird lay there
O'er the shop he had stood sentry;
And JOHN BULL one day, as he pass'd that way,
Caught the brute in the act of entry.
The Bear detected, in John suspected
Nothing else but a rival plunderer.
“We'll share," says he: “there'll be half for me;
And half for you, Old Thunderer !."
JOHN feeling a doubt, in a wrestling bout
Which demolish'd might be, which demolisher,
Ran off for a friend, bis
aid to lend-
One Louis, a skilful French-polisher.
The Bear look'd posed; to the two proposed
Dividing the Turkey in three.
“You take drum-sticks a-piece; there'll be only the grease,
Thighs, breast, and wings for me."
In wrath and derision of this cool proposition,
They warn'd the brute off the premises ;
But he show'd his claws, and growlid from his jaws,-
“If you ain't bungry, there's them as is:
Your threats I brave; the Turkey I'll have,
By foul means or by fair ones;
The Bird in the tussle we shall so tear and hustle,
Those who get bones will get bare ones.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“ Happy.
The bystanders' aid John and Louis pray'd;
But in vain; not a man would budge.
"You let him rob us; our complaints you call’d'fuss;'
When we shouted 'Stop thief !' you said 'fudge.'
Till an Oil and Italian Warehouseman,
Who knew the brute's taste for Sardines,
'Gainst the thievish whelp volunteer'd his help,
To the limit of his small means.
They join'd with a rush; in that first brush,
There were doubts which would come off worser.
JOHN made more than one blunder, but, on staggʻring asunder,
'Twas bellows to mend with Ursa.
JOHN was getting his wind, 'ere again he pinn'd
The Bear, with purpose sure,
When the German band, which stood close at hand,
Proposed an overture!
“That be Double d!” says JOHN, says he,-
“Your brass and wind, I know them!
Help us, or help Bear,-- which, I don't much care ;
Bat as for your overtures, blow them!
Be off, vile pack, or”—the band drew back,
For the weight of his fist they knew :
And when our report left the scene of sport,
They were squaring for round number two.
A CHANCE FOR A GREAT YOUNG MAN.
For any Great Unknown, desirous of becoming known as the Author
of a work of fiction equivalent to another Waverley, a splendid opening
is afforded by a liberal anonymous publisher, who has inserted the pro-
position following among the advertisements in the Atheneum.
UTHORS.-A PUBLISHER OF STANDING wants a GOOD

A good novel is a good thing, but the publisher who obtains one for
£100 will make that good thing a somewhat better thing.,
man be his dole," as the subjects of QUEEN ELIZABETH used to say, if
be gets a Tom Jones or a Vanity Fair
for a hundred pounds. What an
unlucky thing it is for this enterprising publisher that he did not pro-
mulgate this alluring offer of his a few months ago, before, perhaps,
arrangements were concluded for the publication of Little Dorrit.
This publisher belongs to the past. What a big fish he might have
hooked in that Elizabethan time and the succeeding reign, JACOBI
Primi, by advertising something under a hundred pounds, according to
1 he then value of money for a good Tragedy-landed Macbeth perhaps,
who knows?-or Hamlet? And had he happily lived to "wait a little
longer," there would have been a good time coming," wherein, fishing
with the same golden hook, he might have caught a Paradise Lost;
nay, a lighter hook for that matter would have served his turn, had he
thought to bob or angle, not to say sniggle, for a good Epic Poem.
However, as there are, peradventure, among us mute inglorious
MILTONS still,—though this hundred-pound snap-hook is not rigged for
that sort of JACK, so there probably also are RICHARDSONS and FIELD-
INGS equally silent and unknown to fame, but desirous of making a
noise and becoming famous, who for the advantage of a lift into pub-
licity, and the additional consideration of one hundred pounds, may be
glad enough to barter a production of genius, which, for the generous
and discerning publisher, may realise at least the square of that figure.
To the "publisher of standing” ready to stand a hundred pounds for
a good novel, we can only say in addition, that we wish he may get it.

THE HOUSE OF HATS.'
An ingenious batter at Paris bas built himself
a house with no other building materials than
old hats. We can understand the propriety of
using hats for the upper storey, and we can easily
conceive that in the construction of the roof, a
quantity of old hats might supply the place of
tiles. We, however, doubt the wisdom of erecting
an entire dwelling of an article so unsubstantial
as felt, and we can only imagine that an indi-
vidual who resorts to a residence consisting of
old hats, must be satisfied with anything he can
put his head into, by way of a home. The same
high wind that would blow one's bat off would
probably blow one's house down, if the latter
were made of the same stuff as the former, and
it would be necessary to live in a perpetual state
of wide-awake, to guard against the probability
of having one's hatty dwelling whisked about
one's ears.

PSALMODY FOR THE STUPID.
The attention of the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY is respectfully
invited to the subjoined portion of a recent advertisement :-
H Н TYMNS FOR THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND.-This Book will, it
is hoped, be found to combine, with a high and holy tone, theological accuracy of
expression, and a strict regard to sense and grammar, rhyme, and rhythm."
It is proper that the ARCHBISHOP should know that the foregoing is
not the joke of some Roman Catholic or other dissenting buffoon.
The advertisement, whence it is taken, appeared in the Times. Can it
be necessary to advertise, for the use of the Church of England, hymns
correct as to sense, construction, and metre? Are the hymns, com-
monly sung in churches, devoid, to any considerable extent, of mean-
ing; deficient, also, in respect of syntax and prosody? That a demand
might exist in the Mormon Society for rational and grammatical hymns
is intelligible; but the supposition that the Established Church sings
any other sort of hymns, is either a shocking libel, or a tremendous
satire, on the Church.

HEROES AT A DISCOUNT.
We have seen in the shop windows a large engraving repre-
senting a number of military officers, and labelled with the
words,“ WATERLOO HEROES, ONE GUINEA; SOLD AT FOUR
GUINEAS.” We do not see why the Waterloo Heroes should
have undergone such a terrible reduction as to have fallen no
less than seventy-five per cent.; and, indeed, we cannot belp
thinking that some of the Crimean Heroes—if we take into
account the treatment they have met with-are better adapted
to be regarded in the light of an alarming sacrifice. The
Waterloo Heroes have done nothing, and suffered nothing,
recently which can account for their suddenly falling in public
estimation to one-fourth of the price that was formerly set
upon them. Military heroes, we know, are at all times liable
to be "cleared off;" and there are many officers that "must

fame of the Waterloo Heroes might, we think, have sustained
them at the price at which it seems they have been “regularly

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SOMETHING OUT OF NOTHING.
CONSIDERING the scarcity, of Sinecures, they
ought to be at a premium just now, and there
should consequently be a rather brisk demand
for a thing we saw advertised the other day as
"a Sinecure of £1,500 per annum.” The candidate
for this comfortable position must be prepared to
“introduce £15,000," or rather to educe and pull
out the sum in question, for which he will be
allowed interest at the rate of five per cent., in
addition to the salary attacbed to bis Sinecure.
This eligible opportunity is offered, with propor-
tionate advantages, to the owner of ten, or even
five, thousand pounds, but the advertiser candidly
admits that to the capitalist producing the full
amount of £15,000 the preference will be
given.” It is natural that fifteen thousand
pounds should be preferred to five, or even to
ten, and we do not wonder that the owner of the
first-named sum should be regarded with peculiar
favour by the patrons of the Sipecure. The
place, to which no duties attach, is said to be
exactly suited to a Member of Parliament, a
clergyman, or even a lady; and as there is
pothing to do, but only somebody to be done, we
bave no doubt that parties will be found whose
capacity of pocket and incapacity for work will
fit them for the position.

THE SONG OF HIAWATHA.
(Author's Protectioe Edition.)
I should answer, I should tell you,
Shut your mouth, and go to DAVID,
DAVID, Mr. Punch's neighbour,
Buy the Song of Hiawatha,
Read, and learn, and then be thankful
Unto Punch and HENRY WADSWORTH,
Punch, and noble HENRY WADSWORTH,
Truer poet, better fellow,
Than to be annoy'd at jesting
From his friend, great Punch, who loves him.
Hiawatha's graceless father,
There's Nokomis, there's Wenonah,
Ladies both, of various merit,
Puggawangun, that's a war-club,
Pau-puk-keewis, he's a dandy
Barr'd with streaks of red and yellow,
And the women and the maidens
Love the handsome Pau-puk-keewis,"
Tracing in him Punch's likeness.
Then there's lovely Minnehaba, -
Pretty name with pretty meaning,
It implies the Laughing-Water, -
And the darling Minnehaha
Married noble Hiawatha ;
And her story 's far too touching
To be sport for you, you donkey,
With your ears like weaver Bottom's,
Ears like booby Bully Bottom.
Once upon a time in London,
In the days of the Lyceum,
Ages ere keen ARNOLD let'it
To the dreadful Northern Wizard,
Ages ere the buoyant MATHEWS
Tripp'd upon its boards in briskness, –
I remember, I remember
How a scribe, with pen chivalrous,
Tried to save these Indian stories
From the fate of chill oblivion.
Out came sundry comic Indians
Of the tribe of Kut-an-hack-um.
With their Chief, the clean Efmatthews,
TORYISM IN THE WASHING-TUB.
AMONG the wants of the other day, as adver-
tised in the Times, we met with an intimation
that one H. F., of Wandsworth, requires a
Mangle. There is nothing very remarkable in
this yearning for an article of much utility on
the part of one who may be desirous of making
things as smooth as possible; but we confess
we were rather struck by the intimation that
"no new inventions are desired.” Why an
individual should want a mangle, and yet set his
face obstinately against any improvement in
mangles, is a problem we cannot solve; and
when we reflect that in these days of progress
mangles are particularly likely to take a turn,
we find the objection to new inventions still
more unaccountable. We presume that_the
advertisement proceeds from some old Tory
laundress who lags in the rear of everything like
reform, and who in her choice of a mangle
would hang on to the old rope rather than adopt
the patent chain and the wheel, which certainly
has a tendency to revolution. It is, however,
a pretty good sign of the times when the fear of
innovation has sunk as low down in the social
scale as the suburban washerwoman, who is
perhaps as adverse to improvement in her
orthography as in the implements of her trade,
and who probably, intimates by the words
“MANGELIN DUN" her readiness to serve her
customers.

(Coming awkward, for the accents,
Into this his latest rhythm)
Write we as Protracted Fellow,
Or in Latin, Longus Comes,
Buy the Song of Hiawatha.
Should you ask me, Is the poem
Worthy of its predecessors,
Worthy of the sweet conceptions,
Of the manly, nervous diction,
Of the pbrase, concise or pliant,
Of the songs that sped the pulses,
Of the songs that gemm’d the eyelash,
Of the other works of HENRY?
I should answer, I should tell you,
You may wish that you may get it,
Don't you wish that you may get it ?
Should you ask me, Is it worthless,
Is it bosh and is it bunkum,
Merely facile flowing nonsense,
Easy to a practised rhythmist,
Fit to charm a private circle,
But not worth the print and paper
DAVID Bogue hath here expended ?
I should answer, I should tell you,
You're a fool and most presumptuous.
Hath not HENRY WADSWORTH writ it?
Hath not Punch commanded "Buy it p.”
Should you ask me, What's its nature ?
Ask me, What's the kind of poem?
Ask me in respectful language,
Touching your respectful beaver,
Kicking back your manly hind-leg,
Like to one who sees his betters;
I should answer, I should tell you,
'Tis a poem in this metre,
And embalming the traditions,
Fables, rites, and superstitions,
Legends, charms, and ceremonials
Of the various tribes of Indians,
From the land of the Ojibways,
From the land of the Dacotahs,
From the mountains, moors, and fenlands,
Where the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gar,
Finds its sugar in the rushes :
From the fast-decaying nations,
Which our gentle Uncle SAMUEL
Is improving, very smartly,
From the face of all creation,
Off the face of all creation.
Should you ask me, By what story,
By what action, plot, or fiction,
All these matters are connected ?
I should answer, I should tell you,
Go to Bogue and buy the poem,
Publish’d, neatly, at one shilling,
Publish'd, sweetly, at five shillings.
Should you ask me, Is there music
In the structure of the verses,
In the names and in the phrases ?
Pleading, that, like weaver Bottom,
You prefer your ears well tickled ;
I should answer, I should tell you,
HENRY's verse is very charming:

COMMON THINGS.
It is a common thing for the conductor of a
Brompton omnibus to propose to put you
down within “a heasy valk" of Brixton.
It is a common thing for a wife whose hus-
band comes home late from a dinner-party to be
told, “ Myd-ear I shureyou porrionour I
shefirstogerriway.”
It is a common thing for men who "won't
detain you a minute to hold you by the
button-hole for more than an hour.
It is a common thing for an undergraduate
to discover after a wine-party that he has
taken too much coffee.
It is a common thing upon one's entrance
into what are advertised as “ quiet lodgings,"
to find them tenanted already by a troop
of squalling children and an amateur cornopean.
With the growling Downy Beaver,
With the valiant Monkey's Uncle,
Came the gracious Mari-Kee-lee,
Firing off a pocket-pistol,
Singing too, that Mudjee-keewis
(Shorten'd in the song to “Wild Wind”),
Was a spirit very kindly.
Came her Sire, the joyous Kee-lee,
By the waning tribe adopted,
Named the Buffalo, and wedded
To the fairest of the maidens,
But repented of his bargain,
And his brother Kut-an-hack-ums
Very nearly chopp'd his toes off.
Serve him right, the fickle Kee-lee.
If you ask me, What this memory
Hath to do with Hiawatha,
And the poem which I speak of ?
I should answer, I should tell you,
You 're a fool, and most presumptuous;
'Tis not for such humble cattle
To inquire what links and unions
Join the thoughts, and mystic meanings,
Of their betters, mighty poets,
Mighty writers—Punch the mightiest.
What Shall we Have for Dinner ?
In answer to the above question, a Railway
Porter says: “It depends a great deal upon
what you can conveniently get out of the
bampers, and also what particular game and
fish happen to be in season. For instance, at
this time of the year, (he modestly observes)
a turbot, a few smelts, a small leg of Dartmoor
mutton, a partridge, and a couple of teal, with
a pine-apple, make a nice little dinner, that a
Railway Director need not be ashamed of."
REAL BENEFACTORS OF THE CHURCH.

LOOSE THOUGHTS.
BY A FAST MAN.
PRIVATE
ADVERTISEMENTS
When the maiden aunt comes in at the door, it is time
for the cigar to fly out of the window.
We all have our troubles. But I doubt if anything
be half so annoying as, when giving your address to a tailor
whom you have never before done business with, acci.
dentally letting a ticket from your pawnbroker drop out
of your card-case.
The pursuit of knockers is sometimes under difficulties.
But few things perhaps more completely damp one's ardoor
for it than the emptying of a water-jug from the first floor
window.
In my dealings with “knowing cards” I have found
them pretty generally turn up knaves.
It is a waste of breath disputing with a cabman. The
only reasoning to use with him is a, knock-down argu.
ment.
Every rose has its thorn. I never helped to shawl the
flower of a ball-room without being convinced, by painful
evidence, that she had a pin about her.
The reflective mind may derive considerable entertain-
ment from the train of thought induced by directing
agriculturists from the Cattle-Show in Baker Street to pro-
ceed, viá Charing Cross and Holborn to the Great Western
Railway : or by showing a May-Meetingite the back pas-
sage to the Cider Cellars as being a short cut into Exeter
Hall.
I have learnt by experience, that when one's head splits
in the morning the best thing is to soda it.
Crossing-sweepers may talk of the difficulties of life;
but, to my mind, there is nothing half so hard in it as to
walk straight home to your rooms after a wine-party, and
having found your latchkey, to ascertain, without dropping
it, the whereabouts of the keybole.
When a man intends to make a night of it, he will do
well to leave his card-case bebind him. The name of
“SMITH” covers a multitude of sprees, and his address
will be shown by his skill in concealing it.
Finally, my friend, there is folly in procrastination.
Therefore, never put off till to-morrow the tradesman who
can be done to-day.

ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM.
Last night, a most important Meeting of the Administrative Reform
Body was held at the Bottle of Smoke, Makebelieve Street. MR.
FROTHAN took the chair; and briefly called the attention of the
Meeting to the fact that Parliament ostensibly renewed its duties on
the 31st inst. During the recess, administrative reformers had kept
all their eyes upon the House of Commons; and the effect of such
vigilance bad been significantly shown even in the mildewed recesses of
Downing Street. (Cheers.)
MR. BUMPTIOUS must congratulate the Meeting and the country on
the many triumphs obtained—and no less obtained because achieved
with the most perfect tranquillity-by Administrative Reform. For
instance : what was the condition of CHARLES THE FIRST at Charing-
Cross, when administrative reformers first took the field ? KING
CHARLES might be considered a national institution : nevertheless he
was eaten-up with the King's-evil of verdigris. Again, the spurs of
his Majesty were in a lamentable state of decay; whilst a bridle was
wholly wanting. What was the condition of the statue at the present
moment ? A bran-new, beautiful pair of spurs had been affixed to the
royal figure; and the long-desired bridle duly supplied. And did these
things mean nothing? Were they typical of nothing? Let not their
opponents think it. He (MR. B.) would tell them, that the new spurs
denoted that Administrative Reform did not permit Routine to go on in
its old jog-trot way; but, on the contrary, would compel it to mend
its paces, to keep up with the pace of the people. (Cheers.) Did the
bridle mean nothing, either? Why, yes; it meant that, when required,
the aristocracy should be curbed, and brought up, and if necessary-(not
that he believed it would be necessary)—thrown upon its haunches.
(Loud Cheers.) To any carping, narrow-minded dissentient who ques-
tioned the utility, the active beauty, he would say, of Administrative
Reform, he would fearlessly point to KING CHARLES's spurs, and KING

GOOD RIDDANCE OF BAD RUBBISH.
An auctioneer has just enjoyed the privilege of "knock-
ing down a prison.” That well-known, but by no means
favourite resort, the Borough Compter, has recently been
brought to the hammer, or, rather, the hammer has been
brought to it, and the whole has been knocked down in a
variety of lots to the highest bidders. We do not quite
understand the motives of the various purchasers at this
sale ; for we do not see what use can be made of a quantity
of spikes, a parcel of iron bars, and a mass of miscellaneous
prison properties. Perhaps to some people there would be
à sort of excitement in fitting up a room as a prison, and
undergoing a little voluntary incarceration, by way of
giving a zest to liberty. That there must be some such
feeling in existence, is proved by the fact stated in the
reports, that "several persons took the opportunity of
visiting the prison." We did not hear that some persons
took the opportunity of getting out of the prison, which
would have been in our eyes a far more sensible movement.
We cannot think that much could have been realised by the
sale; for handcuffs are out of date, spikes are of no use to
anybody-not even excepting the owner-and, as to fetters,
they are not in demand even for dancing bornpipes on the
stage, which is the last use we ever heard of their having
been put to.

AN END TO BEGGING.
(4 Hint to Sir R. W CARDEN.)
THERE would very soon be an end to begging, if the
following penalties were strictly carried out :-
For the First offence. A Fine of Five Shillings.
For the Second. A Fine of Five Pounds.
For the Third. Three Months' Imprisonment.
The above punishments we would have fall, not on the
beggar, but on the man who relieves the beggar; for inas-
much as he encourages begging, he is in truth the real
beggar, and he should be punished accordingly. Two or
three fines of Five Pounds, or one powerful infliction of

And his hand upon bis brow?
As he watch'd the awful sight.
And she was gone-how, no one knew-
On a volume spread before him
But each felt a wind go by.
He pores, in study deep-
The while he watch'd the combat,

And years pass'd on: an army

From Collatia was come.

And with port of pride, and scornful stride,

And TARQUINIUS felt a horror,
By tyranny at bome,

THE CENTRAL BOARD IN DANGER.
The Central Board of Metropolitan Works has been in
imminent danger of self-destruction ; for it has shown a
tendency to commit a sort of official suicide, by making all
its Members vacate their seats on their self-election to all
the salaried offices. The business of the Board opened with
the absorption of MR. TẠWAITES in the paid chairman-
ship; and this was followed up by the threatened swamping
of MR. WILKINSON in the Chief Clerkship. If a check
had not been put to the manja wbich seemed to have sprung
up among the Board of electing itself to all paid offices
in its own gift, the probability is, that there would not have
been a Member of the original body left; but that the
whole of those who had been elected to govern the
Metropolis would have been found serving it at somewhat
extravagant salaries. It has been said, with much truth,
than the representative system is now put upon its trial;
and we should very much lament to find that the representa-
tive system had been exemplified by every one repre-
senting his own interest and a general division of all
the paid offices among those who are entrusted with the
responsibility of finding proper persons to fill them. Allow-
ing that when the Board looked round for a chairman at
£1,500 a year, it was impossible to find so fit a man for the
post and the pay as MR. TAWAITES, it is not very likely
that the best clerks, architects, surveyors, and all the other
recipients of the money at the disposal of the Board, would
be found within the same narrow circle. The notice that
has been taken of this disposition to appropriate to itself
all the lucrative places in its own gift, will probably have
the effect of checking the Board in its career of self-destruc-
tion; but, if it should be persevered in, we would propose
as a design for a seal, the very appropriate subject of Saturn
devouring his own children.

A MAD WAG'S ADVERTISEMENT.
We beg leave to call the attention of Pro-
FESSOR OWEN to the very contradictory animal
referred to in an extraordinary advertisement,
relating to a Bath cbair, which we are told “may
be drawn by either a man or pony, painted
maroon, lined with drab cloth and holland
covers." We can understand the possibility of
painting either a man or a pony "maroon,"
though we should question the good taste or
the utility of applying such a mode of external
decoration to either animal; but that either of
them should be "lined with drab cloth and hol-
land covers ” is a phenomenon we at once pro-
nounce incredible. It is true that a man's
stomach lias a coat, and so we presume has a
pony's, which may account in some degree for
ihe very whimsical notion of a man or pony
"lined with cloth;" and we have a faint glim-
mering of an idea suggestive of “holland covers
arising out of the tendency of an inveterate gin-
drinker to cover bis inside with Hollands.
Nevertheless, the advertisement is so odd, that
if the advertiser were to take it into his head
to poison half bis relations, make away with
himself, or steal a pound of pork sausages, we

HER MAJESTY'S PLEASURE.
The Sovereign ought to be, as she is, one of the
most amiable persons in all her dominions; for, judging
by the variety of insignificant matters that are described
as “HER MAJESTY's pleasure,” we should say that
HER MAJESTY must be very easily pleased. The
Gazette of the other day furnishes a long list of what
must be termed Royal Amusements, for we are told in
every case that "THE QUEEN has been pleased." There
does not seem to be much enjoyment to be derived from
certain arrangements connected with the Island of
Tobago; nor should we suppose that the approval of a
MR. LEVISON of Birmingham as Consul for Chili, would
be the source of much happiness or diversion to the
mind of HER MAJESTY, but we are bound to believe that
there is a sort of tranquil satisfaction about the matter,
for we are told by the Gazette that "the QUEEN has
been pleased."
With all the kindness of disposition for which HER
MAJESTY may be remarkable, and with all her readiness to
be delighted with everything and everybody about her, we
do not believe that the QUEEN could really have been
“ pleased” to allow one “ROBERT BUSSELL, of Suffolks, to
take and use the name of PETTIWARD only, instead of
tbat of BUSSELL.” We cannot understand the possibility
of anybody having any, pleasure whatever in allowing a
fellow-creature to call himself by such a name as PETTI-
WARD, though we admit that BUSSELL is by no means a
pretty appellation. We are aware that the language of the
Gazette is in accordance with ancient form ; but, otherwise,
we should remonstrate against the impropriety of libelling
HER MAJESTY by the assertion that "the QUEEN was
pleased” at the fact of one of her subjects wanting to
call himself by a very ugly cognomen.

SIR Tom; for since the time when, as another Ton sings of the Armada
signals,

the people of London have shown themselves too far north to stand
any such start as yours. Let that Heath alone.
VINCENT SCULLY persists in his mischievous interference with the
Sunday Question, and like an illogical Irish blunderer, as he is, threatens
to move that all the clubs be shut up on Sunday, unless the exhibitions
are opened. Such blockheads ruin whatever cause they advocate.
Mr. Punch means to get VINCENT the Royal licence to call himself, as
other people call him, Num Scully. The Currency Question-one of
the subjects whicb, were Representation a reality instead of a sham, it
would take up earnestly and gravely, is to be burked, but Government

but would tell notbing more. Thanks were voted to a retiring clerk
at the table, MR. LEY, who has endured the debates for forty-two years,
and is as well as could be expected. Mr. Punch, M.P., to whom
MR. LEY has always been most polite, begs to congratulate him on his
release. SIR GEORGE GREY introduced rather a good County Police
Bill, which seemed generally acceptable to the country gentlemen,
notwithstanding its apparently fair principle.
Our friend BROTHERTON brought in his usual Midnight motion, and
it was opposed by LORD PALMERSTON ; who unblushingly said, that
Members must not mind late bours, for they were sent to do the busi-

much even for the House, which, however, hurried to division, and
rejected the motion by ill to 50. MR. PACKE then brought in a
Church-Rate Bill, which SIR W. CLAY declared to be far worse than
the present law, and assented to its introduction; but later in the week
brought in a Bill for the entire Abolition of the Rate.

VALENTINE BY A YOUNG LADY. WARRANTED.
'Tis Leap-year now and I am free!
For Woman's tongue and Woman's pen
Within that time may speak what she
May neither breathe nor write save then.
I love thee! Say, my joy, my life,
Wilt thou accept me for thy wife
I will not tell thee all I feel.
Wben on the fire my bosom feeds,
Which those calm quiet eyes reveal,
Those two fine large full brilliant beads,
So beautiful, so blue, that shine
Beneath thy smooth brow's pencill'd line.
A face of wax I've often seen,
Fair and unfurrow'd as thine own;
As fresh, as rosy, as serene;
Divine-but for one want alone!
That want in thee supplied I fiod :
Eyes, nose, and mouth-and also Mind.
As on some clothier's model, sit
Those garments-trousers, coat, and vest.
Those boots—those gloves-how well they fit!
But thou art no mere figure drest,
No mimic beau of senseless mould,
So elegant!-but oh, so cold !
CUTTING UP AN AUDIENCE.
Since in his innocent youth Mr. Punch heard the pleasant story,
how a very thin audience once yentured to disapprove a certain
theatrical performance, and the whole force of the company rushed
upon the stage, outnumbered, and hissed out their generous benefactors,
be has not been better pleased than with a recent article in the Times
Newspaper. The keen-eyed and kindly critic of the theatres, discoursing
upon the production at the Adelphi Theatre of a dramatised version
of the “Children's Elopement” in Household Words, gives due praise
thereto, as “a perfect instance of a story taken out of a book, and placed
upon a stage," and describes it as "a neatly executed cabinet picture,” in
which MR. BENJAMIN WEBSTER gave an “elaborate embodiment of a most
original character.” Having thus shown why the little drama deserved
the applause of the audience, the critic justly and boldly turns upon
those who withheld it, and (of course with gentlemanly periphrase)
intimates that they were a set of asses. Which we potently believe to
be the truth of the matter.
Punch very heartily thanks the Times' critic for breaking this new
ground, and recognising the Limited Liability of audiences to bear
their sbare in an evening's entertainment. The public is as much
bound to play its part as the stage company. The French, who know
something about these things, admit the fact-their phrase is, that, they
assist”, at a representation. If an assistant at a play misbehaves
bimself, he deserves a rap over the head as much as an Assistant-Judge,
or an assistant-linendraper. An audience ought to listen, to encourage
at need, to laugh in the right place, and to hiss where neglect or buſ.
foonery is observable. And if the public would use their brains and
their hands, instead of ignorantly approving or lazily enduring every:
thing, the artists would be kept upon their mettle, the actor of merit
would double exertions that were appreciated, the stick would be sent
back to his desk, and the buffoon remitted to the acrobatic ring. It is
in no small degree the fault of the public, that the standard of art is not
much higher than it is.
We think that the Times' hint might be followed out with advantage.
Only, it might be but fair to discriminate in the salle as upon the stage.
For instance, let a watchful critic come out with something of this
kind, after a new piece. "Too much praise cannot be given to the
pit-boxes for their attention and judicious applause, but we were sorry
to observe the left proscenium box so careless, and more intent upon
bouquets and flirting than upon the piece. The dress-boxes were
respectable, and the gallery very painstaking with what was out of its
usual line. The second tier was heavy, with the exception of the
stout lady who filled much too small a part of a seat, and whose decla-
mation at intervals was remarkable. The pit was beneath contempt,
indulging in vulgar grinning when such a demonstration was out of
place, and passing over some of the best acting. This audience has
improved, but still has much to learn.” We think that this kind
of thing, or if necessary a yet more personal identification of indi-
viduals, whose names might be got from the box-keepers, would put
audiences on the qui vive, and once more we heartily thank the Times'
critic for another addition to his many capital suggestions upon a
subject he understands so well.

Prussia to the godless march threatened upon Courland. Of the

BRIEFLESS ON PEERAGES FOR LIFE.
We understand that MR. BRIEFLESS has written a very
elaborate opinion on the great Constitutional question of
Peerages for Life; and he has arrived at the conclusion,
that such Peerages are perfectly legal, and in accordance
with precedent. It is rather strange that in the great
debate of Thursday night the case of BARON NATHAN
was not alluded to, for it is notorious that the Barony of
NATHAN will become extinct on the demise of the present
illustrious holder the title. It is not generally known
that though BARON NATHAN has never been called up to
the House of Lords, he has been summoned to sit in
Parliament (Street)—for his portrait--at the Daguerreotype
artist's at the corner.
It is rather a remarkable circumstance, that MR. DUNUP
has prepared a very learned and elaborate opinion on the
great Peerage Question, and has come to a conclusion
exactly opposed to that arrived at by MR. BRIEFLESS.
MR. DunUp maintains—though any maintenance from such
a quarter is rather doubtful—that a Peerage ought to be
hereditary; and he urges very powerfully, that a want of
fortune is not a sufficient reason for refusing to ennoble a
family, inasmuch as a nobleman being privileged from arrest
for debt, is in the best possible position to live without an
income. MR. Dunup takes the high Constitutional view
of the matter, and asks indignantly: "If we are to trifle
with our Peerage, what is to become of our Throne and our
Altar?”
The Head of Austria.
“How extremely flat-headed the EMPEROR seems to be!"
exclaimed an Englishman to an Austrian at Vienna during
a religious ceremony, in which young FRANCIS JOSEPH,
hareheaded, was carrying a wax-taper as long as himself.
“Hush?" nervously answered the Austrian, in a whisper,
"The EMPEROR's flatness is easily accounted for-isn't he

THE SABBATARIAN AT HOME.
The Times of Valentine's Day contained an account of a deputation
to Lord PALMERSTON, composed of “ministers and laymen of all
Evangelical denominations," to the number of between one hundred
and one hundred and fifty, with the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY at
their head. The business on which these gentlemen thought proper
to trouble the noble lord was not their own. Nor was it altogether
the business of other people. It was the pleasure and recreation of
other people, with which these kind gentlemen propose to interfere.
Their object was to entreat the PREMIER not to countenance or assent
to “any motion tending to open the Museums, Crystal Palace, and
other places of worldly amusement," on the Sunday. Lambeth Palace,
of course, affords no amusement but what is unworldly and celestial.
Forty-six of these Sabbatarians, in addition to the PRIMATE, the
Times enumerates by name. Let everybody refer to this nominal list
of the deputed, and see if it contains the name of anybody that he
knows. If it does, let him inquire, and, if possible, ascertain, in what
manner that serious and officious gentleman is bimself accustomed to
observe the Sunday. Let him in the material guarantees of a suit of
black and a white tie-present himself at the gentleman's area-gate,
FOTO
ring the bell, and obtain faithful answers to the following questions.
On a Sunday morning, -
1. Is the gentleman in the habit of washing himself?
N.B. Diurnal ablution is not a work of necessity; many go unwashed
for days; some never wash at all; and it appears that this was the case
with several personages who, notwithstanding, died in the odour of
sanctity. They, however, it must be admitted, mostly wore horsehair-
shirts instead of cambric, and are claimed by the idolatrous Church of
Rome. Besides, the Sabbatarian might blend consistency with
cleanliness by establishing, and partaking in, a general Saturday night's

JUSTICE THREATENED WITH CORRUPTION.
The Judges of the Court of Queen's Bench scarcely ever
sit at Guildhall without complaining of the horrible odour
of the place; and the other day justice was literally turned
out of doors, for Lord CAMPBELL, finding that the windows
could not be opened, to allow the noxious vapours to escape,
made his own escape by the nearest aperture. The Court
was broken up for the purpose of ventilation, the Chief
Justice making for his private room with precipitancy,
whilst the bar rushed in a body towards the rohing-room,
and the almost asphyxiated usher found safety in hanging
himself half out of a skylight.
Until the other day, nobody had the faintest idea how
it was that the Judges should be in such very bad odour
whenever they got into the City, but it has just been
discovered that the Court of Queen's Bench in Guildhall,
is exactly over a spot in which a lot of lord mayors, and a
miscellaneous mob
of aldermen have claimed the privilege"
of being buried. LORD CAMPBELL has, in fact, been sitting
on the family vault of the Corporation of London, and the
Bench is little better than a tombstone. The Court is a
mere civic cemetery, and the Judges ought at once to be
exonerated from the painful duty of dealing with the bones
of contention of the living among the skeletons of the
departed; and sitting over aldermanic remaios to dispose
of remands. We do not see how the difficulty is to be got
rid of, unless the Court issues at once a writ of habeas
corpus to some undertaker in the neighbourhood, and the
Judges refuse to sit in the obnoxious locality again, until
a writ of inquiry has been executed, and a return of nulla

effected.

Where hearth-stones and Brick of Bath
Slay the peace of every hearth;

And the fishman shrieks his wishes
That we'd buy his flaccid fishes,

to relieve him of all suspense, was immediately tried and condemned. He was
sentenced to be fired from one of his own guns. The unfortunate man was first
horribly compressed to reduce his figure to the bore of the piece of ordnance, and
was then fired off into infinite space, the military band of the SULTAN playing the
national music. The widows of the unfortunate man have, with considerable diffi-
culty and praiseworthy fortitude, collected his scattered remains in their work-
baskets.
Musad EL-CHALKI, a miller of opulence, was found guilty of adulterating his
flour with gypsum. He was therefore sentenced to be walled up. That is, he
was fastened by chains to a wall, and his mouth covered with mortar four inches
thick. Before him was set a dish of mutton kabobs and other savoury food; the
pleasant smell of which ascended to his nostrils, whilst in due season famine fed
upon his vitals. On the tenth day he had eaten all the mortar, and was then
permitted to squat and take fifty grains of rice.
ABDERRHAMAN PLANKI was found guilty of mixing sawdust with rhubarb, to
the injury of the sick who should swallow the adulterated drug, and to the scandal
of Turkey, whose national character rests upon its rhubarb. The culprit was sen.
tenced to receive the bastinado; he underwent five hundred blows on the soles of
his feet, that were then dressed with a hot poultice of sawdust, his own sawdust
sorted from his own rhubarb, that he was graciously allowed, or rather compelled,
to swallow in its purified state. His dose was a quarter of a pound a-day; and
at the end of a week he was going on-what remained of him-quite as well as could
be expected.
I might add to these instances of summary justice, but have, perhaps, given a
sufficient number. As I have said, the old bigoted school of Turks complain
bitterly of them; wholly attributing them to the example of England, whose
world-wide reputation for commercial purity, from the British contractor to the
British greengrocer, has excited in the breast of the Sultan a spirit of emulation.
AN ODE TO SIR BENJAMIN HALL.
MEMBER for Mary'bone !
Of the applause of marrow-bone and cleaver,
Thou in old times had'st shone
The honoured and ingenuous receiver;
But marrow-bones and cleavers have their day,
They ring, they rattle, and they pass away!
A more enduring triumph greets thee-
Punch with his Pipes Pandean meets thee-
His Pipes Pandean, and his double drum-
To greet bis BENJAMIN, Lo, Punch is here!
To greet his BENJAMIN, in Ode sincere;
All lesser praise be dumb!
In Chaos London long had weltering lain,
Flound'ring in mud and mire,
Unswept, ill-watered, crying for a drain,
Like thirsty cabman 'neath July's hot fire;
Outspread o'er many a rood,
This GULLIVER of cities lay,
While round a Lilliputian brood,
Fettered it to the clay;
Trustees, Commissioners, and Paving Boards,
Each with its hangers-on-rapacious bordes-
Upon the prostrate city worked their will ;
Firing, each, his little arrow
Of Rates into the Giant's marrow,
Who groaned and grumbled, but could do no more,
Fettered head, foot, and hand,
By thick laid strand on strand
Of Local Acts, which none might understand-
So fine the mesh of quibble, quip, and quirk,
That English Law, and English Parliaments can work ;
Then came SIR BENJAMIN, to work be went,
And with his Bill for Better Management,
This set of Local Acts to kingdom come he sent!
So have I seen,
Upon some sluttish village-green,
An aged dog untended lie,
While, o'er his mangy hide and rib-bones high,
The ticks in lively revel held their sway,
Without one kindly hand the torment to allay.
Such was the state of London, as it lay
To Local Boards innumerous a prey,
When BENJAMIN arose and swept the swarms away.
Nor this his only deed that doth demand
Acclaim of pipes and drum at Punch's hand,
To him, O Kensington, thy gardens owe
The Sunday sight they now can show-
A decent crowd, that hears
With pleased and not irreverent ears,
The thrilling music of a good brass band !
And this in spite of Sabbatarians' groan,
Who no religiousness in music own,
(Forgetting sack-but, psaltery, and shawm,
Ànd David's Heaven-ward harp, and psalm)
Who hold the rest of Sunday godless rest,
If taken on the green earth's balmy breast,
Or anywhere, save on the perch
Of some stern, straight-backed pew in chapelor in church, -
Who, if they had their way,
Would stop the lambs from Sunday play,
Forbid the trees from growing,
And check the streams from flowing,
Nor let Heaven's own sun shine on their dark Sabbath
day:
Whom innocent mirth on Sunday sends in twitters;
And who appear to think,
Our only Sunday drink,
Should be their private tap of theologic bitters.
These sour and straight-laced saints thou hast despised,
And therefore shall thy name by Punch be praised and
prized!
Still shall our breezes as they fall,
O'er Thames made pure, from Chelsea to Blackwall,
Keep sweet to after-times the memory of Ben. HALL

LOOSE SILVER AT THE PALACE.
The robbery of HER MAJESTY's plate from the Carrier's cart, to which the
idle flunkeys of Royalty bad consigned it, has caused the greatest consternation
in the Royal Nursery. The juvenile breakfast party at the Palace has been reduced
to Queen's Metal by the abstraction of the QUEEN's silver; and the infant Princes
and Princesses have deplored the loss of their favourite articles. The PRINCE OF
WALES changed countenance at the news of the loss of his mug; and the PRINCESS
Royal, who is waggishly disposed, confessed her surprise, that, with so many
spoons about the Royal household, the teaspoons should not have been more
efficiently looked after. It is to be hoped that, after the proof that has been
given of the uselessness of some at least of the Royal flunkeys, a few of them
may be dismissed, and, to adopt the figure of the PRINCESS ROYAL, the spoons
still remaining may be despatched to look after the spoons that are missing.

Because we are somewhat afraid there's One

And imagine thou hearest entreaty gush

Let the Chaffinch, too, tby attention win;
To the Jenny Wren thine ear incline.
The Linnet and Goldfinch are both away,
The Lark, too, is singing in rural skies;
But they both of them beg of us to say
In our song that they heartily sympathise.

To be silent on any one day in seven;
Oh! be not persuaded to stop those notes
Which we were ordained to trill by Heaven.

At a hypocritical crew's desire,
Thou surely wilt next stretch

To put down, if thou canst, our feathered quire.

THE QUESTIONS OF THE DAY.
What may be called the Questions of the Day
are not always those that are discussed in the
leading columns of the press, but we may often
find what may be termed the Question of the
Day in the Newspaper advertisements. For
some years we were almost daily bored with
the inquiry, “Do you bruise your Oats ?” and
indeed we were so tired with the impertinence of
the demand that, if we had a propensity to bruise
anything, we might have been half inclined to
bruise the individual who was always wanting
to know whether we submitted our oats to the
pugilistic process. Subsequently, we have had
an insulting slur cast upon our polyglot powers,
by the absurd question, “Do you speak French?"
and we are now being daily irritated by baving
the words, “DO YOU LIKE A Dky, Hot, MEALY
Potato?” thrust before our eyes whenever we
take up a Newspaper.
We do not feel at all bound to answer a
question of this kind, more especially as a reply
in the affirmative would seem to entail upon us
the necessity of running off to some place in the
Strand to buy a saucepan. We have no right to
be asked the state of our affections with regard
to any particular vegetable, and we have therefore
determined to preserve the secret of our love-
supposing the potato to be the “loved one”.
rather than place ourselves under a sort of moral
obligation to run out and purchase a pot in which
to boil the presumed object of our attachment.

SOME of the American Papers are trying to
get up a sensation, and to fasten the charge of
repudiation on this country, by reason of there
being some disagreement between the under-
writers and the Transatlantic Telegraph Com-

The business was certainly an unfortunate one,
but we can imagine that there may be a mis-
understanding on the part of the Company,
whose agents have already shown some stupidity;
for instead of establishing telegraphic communi-

dropped a line. As the American Company has

plying that he easily found out what his superiors desired, and was
always ready to do their dirty work. The motion was withdrawn. MR.
BOUVERIE introduced a wise and humane measure for amending the
mode of treating Irish and Scotch paupers in England. SIR GEORGE
GREY then brought in his plan for reforming the Corporation of London.
It need not terrify the
most nervous turtle that ever flapped his fins in
agitation on Messrs. BIRCA's counter. There is still to be a LORD
MAYOR, there are still to be ALDERMEN, COMMON COUNCILMEN, GOG
and MAGOG, Coal Duties, Temple-Bar, Men in Armour, Remem-
brancers, Chaplains, Loving-Cups, CIPRIANI's State Coach, Green Fat,
and MR. TOOLE. The chief points in the bill are, that the under-fed and
over-worked ALDERMEN are to be relieved of some of their fatiguing
duties. Their criminal jurisdiction is to be taken by stipendiary
magistrates, and they are not to be hurried from their breakfasts
to come and sit in the Central Criminal Court. The governing
Council of the City is to be reduced from 232 members to 96,
and a decent franchise is enacted for its constituents. The Alder-
men are to be elected for six years only, not for life; and the
Council is to be chosen yearly; and any member of the Council may
be made a Mayor. Some useless City Courts are to be abolished or
consolidated; the City restrictions on trade are to be done away, as are
the street tolls. Father Thames is to be taken away from the Fathers
of the City, who have so shamefully neglected him. Government is
afraid to enact a uniform police system, so the City Police are still to
be independent of the West-end chief. As bas been intimated, the
coal-duties are still to be exacted; but it ought to be understood,
though SIR GEORGE actually did not know it (such are statesmen and
legislators), that the City takes but fourpence of the thirteen pence
levied—the Government grabbing the rest. This is the bill; and if the
City people are donkeys enough to refuse such a gentle emulsion, they
well deserve the strong dose of reform that will be administered when
a liberal Government comes into office.
Fire insurance is to receive a further check, a paternal Government
imposing a new duty, to prevent our having recourse to foreign offices.

GREAT A. B. C. MEETING.
THE SHOT WE HAVE TO PAY.
FOR Peace I heard the cannon bang,
I counted till a hundred rang,
At each of those explosive sounds,
Thought I-so went one million pounds.
The bells, too, and the cheering boys,
Together made a merry noise,
Their mingled uproar seemed to say
One hundred million pounds-hooray!
That two years' war has cost; and what
For all that money have we got ?
Experience, chiefly, I surmise,
And hope that it may make us wise.
Wiseacres we have been, alas !
Forming one great collective Ass,
And penny-wise, at last we've
found,
Is foolish something o'er a pound.
Obliged to spend those millions—could
We but have spent them as we would,
A little we should have, I trow,
Besides experience now to show.
In widened streets we should rejoice,
Could we have been allowed that choice,
Some architecture would replace
Our edifices mean and base.
Oh! what might not the Board of Health
Have done with part of that vast wealth
Divided into many sums?
For one thing, cleared off all the slums.
The Thames might now be drained-or near
To ebbing bright and flowing clear,
With salmon soon as gudgeon thick
At least as high as Hampton Wick.
We might have founded many schools,
That people might not grow up fools,
We might-what might we not have done
That mortals do beneath the sun ?
Oh! what a stress, oh! what a strain
On thew and muscle, heart and brain,
To work that debt out so immense,
Will be required for ages hence !
Compelled in strife to interpose,
We've had to wipe a bleeding nose,
And through that nose condemned to pay,
Must grin and bear it as we may.
In future we, perhaps, shall keep
Up, both on land and on the deep,
A proper force of armed Police,
Whereby we may preserve the Peace.

1. That the meeting acknowledge the truth that the Schoolmaster is abroad, and are
resolved, to do all in their power, to keep him there.
2. That education, 'at the cost of the State, is no other than an organised attempt to

A ROARING BUSINESS.
A RECENT writer, MR. GERARD, who says, “I have long
studied the roar of the lion," proceeds to give the following
interesting particulars :-
" The roar is composed of some dozen sounds, beginning with subdued
moans, which go on crescendo until they at length diminish, and finish as
they began. There is an interval of some seconds between each sound."
We are told that the lion generally "continues to roar for
a quarter of an hour," and," when he is by bimself, he also
roars on getting up in the morning." This practice on the
part of the lion may furnish some useful hints to those
members of Parliament who evince an anxiety to perfect
themselves in the imitation of the noises made by various
more or less noble animals. It is true that the lion is not
such a popular beast in the House of Commons as the
donkey, whose bray has been brought in some cases to
such perfection that there are some members whom it
would be almost impossible to distinguish from the brute
they imitate. Perhaps the hints furnished in the above
extracts will encourage the adoption of the lion as a model,
in preference to the jackass who has hitherto been the
Parliamentary favourite. If honourable gentlemen who
delight in braying would exercise themselves for a quarter
of an hour every morning in a good roar, the character of
the noises by which the Legislature is sometimes disturbed
would become somewhat more dignified.

It is now beyond doubt ascertained that Spitfire_threw

the Stable-Boy, and who has been the winner in his day of
nineteen cups and six saucers, a bit of the most important
information. He assures me that Ratcatcher coughed and
sneezed three times distinctly rather less than a month
ago! This is genuine; for he was listening at the keybole
at the time and heard it himself. The affair soon got wind;
and the consequence has been that the Odds have gone
down as much as two-sixteenths of a Point. BARON
ROTHSCHILD was at TATTERSALLS a few days since. He
looked at Polly, but didn't say a word. LORD HENRY

A SIMONIDES IN LONDON.
WELL-INFORMED readers very likely require to be apprised that a gentleman of the name of SIMONIDES has been going about England and
elsewhere, vending to College Librarians, Curators of Museums, anå the like, most remarkable ancient manuscripts and other documents, of great
interest and beauty. The only deduction from the value of these articles is, that they turn out to have been the production of M. SIMONIDES
himself, a peculiarity which would seem to have been detected, in this country, by a keen-sighted Oxford Librarian. M. SIMONIDES appears,
by the last advices, to bave been misunderstood on the Continent, and to have been 'arrested and tried in Prussia for "literary forgeries.”
These facts, and the general suspicion which everybody now-a-days entertains about everything, induce Mr. Punch to publish, with more misgivings
than he would otherwise have felt, the following singular document, which he has purchased at an entirely fabulous price, and which was
proffered to him as a hitherto unpublished number of MR. ADDISON’s Spectator. He puts it forth dubiously-perhaps M. SIMONIDEs has been
at work here—but he must say that if so, the imitation of ADDISON is so admirable, the general vraisemblance so remarkable, and the whole affair
so ingenious, that for his own part he would rather have it, than a veritable number of the work. However-caveat emptor after he has paid

THE QUEEN, among her many womanly ways of showing her sym-
pathy for the sufferers crippled by Russian ball and steel-(they must
be especially grateful that Russia is in no way humbled !)-has given
orders for sundry legs and arms, and spinal instruments, made by the
cunning of MR. HEATHER BIGG, the anatomical mechanician, who, it is
averred by capable authorities, would at the beginning of the struggle
have made a much more efficient Minister of War than we were blessed
with; made him arms, legs, head, body, and all at comparatively insig.

MR. Bigg has been summoned for daily attendance at Chelsea Hos-

that more than one officer under question will now want the mecha-

AN EXAMPLE TO YOUNG LADIES.
My face is round and fat, my nose snub, my bair sandy,
I am corpulent and clumsy, my short legs are bandy,
And my hands and feet are broad, my expression is stupid ;
So except in being plump, I'm by no means a Cupid.
Yet like a goose I hoped Her affection to waken,
That She'd love me for my mind-ob, how I was mistaken!
There came a bandsome Swell-your derision don't smother-
She became another's bride, and the Swell was that other.
In his figure, in his style, at every point, in each feature,
He was opposite to me, poor absurd-looking creature;
Then he dressed so very well- at the same time so peatly,
And of course he cut me out by his tailor-completely.
I was spooney in those days, I was soft, green, and sappy,
And I cried, Oh don't I wish she may ever be happy!
They say that of her choice she has sorely repented.
She may now with some one else wish that she'd been contented.
I'm told the bandsome Swell whose attractions had caught her,
Very soon ran through the money for which he had sought her;
At her side he's never seen; but is constant at races,
Is found in billiard-rooms and all those sort of places.
In music they declare that she lessons is giving,
Because he has reduced her to work for her living,
And he pockets all she earns, which he squanders in folly,
So I shouldn't think he makes her what one may call jolly.
All that's hers is his by law; and to change that condition
I hope the House won't listen to any, petition ;
If girls will marry Swells, honest plain young men scorning,
When they are taken in, let their fate prove a warning.

LOUIS NAPOLEON is made to descend in a direct line from CHARLE-

MM
A COUPLE OF INTERESTING COUPLES.
The foreign intelligence of the Times was enriched a few days ago by
the following singularly-or perhaps we should rather say dually-
important announcement which appeared among the marriages.
“On Friday, the 11th inst., at Zierow, in Mecklenburg-Schwerin, BARON DETLEV DE
BULow, eldest son of His Excellency the late BARON DE BULow, of Güdow, Hereditary
Earl Marshal of Lauenburg, to Mary, eldest daugbter of BARON DE BIEL, of Zieros;
and, at the same time and place, BARON ALBRECHT DE MALTZAHN, eldest son of BABON
CHARLES DE MALTZAHN, of Vollrathsruh, in Mecklenburgh, to CAROLINE, second
daughter of BABON DE BIEL, of Zierow."
The British public ought to feel extremely grateful to the families of
Bülow and BIEL, for having gone to the expense of advertising a piece
of news, wbich but for the liberal outlay of the BÜLOWS and the BIELS,
the aforesaid British public would never have been made acquainted
with. We really think the compliment ought to be returned to the
public of Mecklenburg-Schwerin by the insertion in the Gazette or
Zeitung of that diminutive duchy an advertisement somewhat like the
following, which seems to correspond in importance with the one we
have above quoted :-
“MABBIED.-On the 1st of April, at the Hill of Notting, in the Bay of Bayswater,
POLICEMAN THOMAS THOMASON, eldest son of his grand high fussiness the Peadle of
Kensington, Hereditary Successor to all the orders of his late father, the fishmonger,

of Puntonville; and, at the same time and place, ARTHUR HORACE, eldest son of HENET
DE HAMMERSMITB perpetual Torncock of Turnham Green, to SARAH ANx, second
daughter of High Street Keeper Miff, of Pentonville atoresaid."
We are quite satisfied that the foregoing intelligence will be received
at Mecklenburg-Schwerin with quite as much excitement as will be
occa sioned in London by the intelligence of the unions that bave taken
place between the Biels and the Bülows of Güdow and Zierow.

mentally exclaiming “Go it, pumps !” “Go it annihilator !” when the
following thoroughly dramatic incident occurred, and an effect of a
strangely serio-comic nature was the immediate consequence:
“The signal having been given, the man in charge of the annihilator broke the
bottle containing the acid, which ignited the composition, and the vapour commenced
to escape; but in a few seconds the funnel, through which the gas generated in the
machine was passing, blew off, and was projected up to the flies, and lodged under the
bridge of the stage in a heated state. At the same time, the cap or lid of the annihi-
lator was blown off with a poise resembling the discharge of cannon, which knocked
down the man baving charge of the apparatus, and passing by him to a distance of
thirty-five feet. The machine then threw up such a vast body of fire that every one in
the theatre apprehended nothing short of its entire destruction."
This must have been indeed a “surprise" for the assembled com-
pany, who had come to see an annihilator put an imaginary fire out;
when, by some astonishing eccentricity, it blew a real fire in; tossed
its own funnel high into the air ; twirled its own cap, as if it would
"huzza” its own exploit; and performed this feat with such fearful
energy, as to knock down the man who had got it in charge; and,
by way of finishing off with a "blaze of triumph, ," "threw up such a
vast body of fire,” that the "noblemen and gentlemen of the Com-
mittee rushed out into the street;" which, as the only way of effecting
their own insurance, was undoubtedly their best policy. Happily,
there chanced to be in the house a few adherents of the old notion,
that water is better than gas for extinguishing flame; and
"Fortunately the firemen had taken the precaution to bave their engines placed
upon the stage, and charged with water, and they were therefore enabled without the
least delay to render assistance."
The conduct of the large annihilator on two wheels had such an
effect on the sympathies of the other minor annihilators, that
"Another annihilator standing on the stage rolled away, and having broken the iron
and glass of five of the floats, it fell into the orchestra, demolishing one of the music
stands and upsetting the seats.”
It is clear that the little annihilator would not stand idly by, while
its bigger brother was having one of its "games;" and, having broken
five lamp-glasses, demolished a music-stand, and upset a seat, the

SIR F. THESIGER, in the character of Portia.
“ It must not be;
'Twill be recorded for a precedent;
And many an error, by the same example,
Will rush into the state; it cannot be."

THE NAVAL REVIEW.
OF Commons and of Peers
Sing the terrible break-down,
When on Southampton's piers,
Though invited by the Crown,
They were left, all to fume, fret, and frown:
To accommodate the band,
Not a tender was at hand,
And the noblest of the land
Were done brown!
Three miles off afloat
Lay the steamers on the brine-
The hour to sail for the Review,
The tickets said was nine.
But 'twas twelve that April morn by the
chime
Ere they drifted on their path,
Dusty and tired to death,
And ROEBUCK in his wrath
Was sublime !
Even Wood himself had blusbed
To bave looked upon the scene:
In the Harlequin were crushed
Bishop, and Duke, and Dean !
“It's a joke," LORD GRANVILLE cried-
when each gun
Heard afar, with “hip, hip, hips,".
Told the QUEEN had passed the ships,
And LORD CAMPBELL's solemn lips
Said “We're done!”
Again,-again,-again!
And the Transits pace grew slack:
She can't go on, 'tis plain,
'Tis a doubt, if she'll go back:
Even GRANVILLE's mirth is changing into
gloom.
He a boat contrives to hail,
Lest his brother Peers assail,
And consign him to the pale
Stoker's doom!
A hail the Transiteers
The Perseverance gave;
“We are Commons, ye are Peers;
But all privilege we'll waive:
WooD to grief to-morrow night let us bring :
The thing's a sell complete,
We've seen neither Queer nor fleet,
And we've nothing fit to eat-
Not a thing!”
On the Admiralty's chief
What blessings then arose !
Round tough chickens and hard beef
As Peers and Commons close.
And so they cursed their fates, and made no
way:
While folks, with no invite
From the Government, delight
In the sunshine and the sight
Of the day!
Now the railway let us praise
Tell how, that day and night,
The trains went wrong all ways,
And the engines stopped outright.
How from Southampton's, Portsmouth's
shore,
Through the station gates there sweep
Of nobs and snobs a heap,
While some, more luckless, sleep
Round the door.
Brave hearts ! 'Tis Britain's pride,
When she bungles, to outdo
All the bunglers that have tried
What mismanagement can do.
There's some excuse for all who misbehave:
LUCAN, AIREY-injured souls
Called unjustly o'er the coals,
Eac with bullied WOOD condoles
Let them rave!

DANCING WITHOUT A MASTER.
SOMEBODY advertises a Resilient Boot, which is said to include the double advantage of an
evening chaussure and a dancing lesson. The Resilient qualities of the boot are declared
to be perceptible immediately, on entering the ball-room; and we are to presume therefore
that the wearer will either bound into the apartment in a gallop, or glide forwards in a
sort of double shuffle, amidst the assembled company. There may be some advantages
about a boot that sets one dancing directly it is drawn on, but there must also be certain
inconveniences attached to it; and we therefore recommend that parties wearing the article
in question should carry their Resilient Boots like a pair of gloves, for the purpose of
drawing them on at the commencement of a Polka or Quadrille and cleverly kicking them
off when the dance is concluded. Of course, if the contrivance answers its purpose, the
bootmaker will supersede the dancing-master, and we shall have dancing taught in one
easy pair of boots instead of in six easy lessons. We should be glad to know if the Resilient
Boots are calculated for all ages as well as all sizes, and whether they will revive the Terp-
sichorean powers of those who had supposed that their dancing days were over.
ACCOMPLICES IN SPITE OF THEMSELVES.
We should like to know the meaning of the following paragrapb, with reference to a
criminal not in custody at the date when the paragraph appeared in the Newspapers :-
" He is so closely watched both by day and night that the slightest movement on his part would tend to his
capture; and it is hioted that the offer of a reward will lead to his immediate apprehension."
We should be glad to be informed who it is by whom the culprit is " so closely watched
day and night;' and we are also apxious for an explanation why it is, that those who are
watching his movements day and night do not proceed to take him into custody. It seems,
however, that the very vigilant parties in question are waiting for “the offer of a reward,"
and refuse to lay their hands on the suspected assassin until they can also lay their hands on
some money for doing so. If they have him continually in their eye without causing him to
be arrested, it is not quite clear that they do not become accessories after the fact, by
virtually aiding and abetting him in eluding the grasp of justice.
CANDID AND COMPLIMENTARY... We understand that, with a just appreciation of the
value of the House of Commons, the Lords of the Admiralty endeavoured, on the 23rd, to
insure the Perseverance ; but there was not apy member or members of LLOYDS' who would
underwrite her.

A SIGN OF THE SEASON.
The First of this lovely month of May
Was, in sooth, a pretty day;
A keen cold wind from the North-East blew,
Fahrenheit stood at forty-two:
Had it been ten degrees more low,
The purling brooks had ceased to flow.
The daisy and the buttercup,
The young horsechestnut leaves, shrunk up.
The nightingale was mute and mum,
The cuckoo was completely dumb,
Few chimmey-swallows skimmed the lake,
And they had found out their mistake.
Now, what I am about to say,
I saw on this last First of May;
True is the fact which I relate,
I do not chronicle a dream,
On honour bright the thing I state,
Incredible as it may seem:
Across Hyde Park my way I took,
A friend was in my company,
He called to me, and bade me look
At a strange marvel in the sky-
I saw four sea-gulls scudding there,
They drifted on the blast aloft,
I was not gulled—but gulls they were-
On ocean I have seen them oft.
My friend a sportsman was, and he
Those four great sea-gulls saw with me.

EX ANNIHILATORE NIHIL UN-FIT.
We lately noticed the outrageous conduct of a Fire
Annihilator at Drury Lane Theatre, which indulged in
some freaks that we are told ought to be regarded as the
mere eccentricities of genius. We are assured that the
Fire Annihilator can really extinguish a fire with admirable
effect, which we are quite willing to believe; and that it
only requires to be brought fairly into play-or rather fully
into work, for its recent failure was the result of a sort
of playfulness of an exceptional and accidental character.
It does not usually blow its own lid into the air, and injure
its attendants, or eject “burning material” like a miniature
Vesuvius, burn a foreman, scorch a master carpenter, and
lay a gasman prostrate. It seems nobody would have been
hurt at all if nobody had laid bands on the rather rollicking
Annihilator; for the Secretary writes to say, "The injury
occurred, not from the flame or material ejected, but from
touching the heated machine," which ought to be called
the Noli me Tangere, as a bint to bystanders.
Accidents will happen with the best regulated inventions,
and it is quite true that until steam is banished because it
sometimes bursts a boiler, or gas cut off from every human
abode until it gives ample security that it will never
explode, the Fire Annihilator ought not to be discarded
for having once blown its own lid off
. We feel that persons
who exercise their ingenuity in trying to perfect an invention
for the purpose of baffling such a fearful evil as & fire may
become, deserve encouragement rather than ridicule; but
laughing at their failures will tend to accelerate their
success by putting themselves and their Annihilators on
their best behaviour for the future.
We cannot help thinking that the Annihilators take a
somewhat unfeeling view of the gasman's position, for he
is declared to have been “more frightened than hurt,'
though it is added, “his hands were duly treated at the
hospital.” If he was not hurt, but only frightened, his
“hands” would not have required any "treatment” at the
hospital, beyond a hearty shake to congratulate him on his
safety.

DOCTOR HASSALL, the man who has done his best to hunt
Death out of the Pot, bas received a testimonial at the
bands of his friends and admirers : a testimonial that has
no little salt and savour in it, seeing how very felicitously
it embodies the property, and direction of DOCTOR HASSALL'S
genius. The Testimonial is the happy design of the Rev.
G. M. BRANNE; and represents ITHURIEL, clad in armour,
with
his spear touching the toad, in which reptile "sitting

MR. DUNUP'S PROPOSALS FOR A LOAN OF TEN POUNDS.
MR. DUNUP has circulated in the City the following proposals for a Loan of Ten Pounds :-
The sum lent to be repaid when and how I please or can.
Ample security will be given for the sum advanced.
The security consists of a Barrister's Gown and Wig, not much the worse for wear, con-
sidering they have been worn for the last twenty years.
There is, also, a Blue Bag, which will be thrown in.
In addition to the above, there is likewise a handsome Bust of LORD ELDON, the nose of
wbich only is missing, and a Coffee-pot of the best Britannia-metal, which is almost as good
as new, with the exception of the spout and handle, which are temporarily absent.
The security may be inspected after the Ten Pounds have been paid into MR. DUNUP's
bands.
If satisfactory references are expected, they will not be given. Such regulations always
imply a degree of suspicion, which, to the one party, is most galling and irritating, and to the
other party is only productive of trouble, expense, annoyance, and disappointment. It is to
save the latter, that the form in this instance is dispensed with.
A Bill, to be accepted by MR. DUNUP, will be given for the full amount, without any
deductions whatever.

to the title she will receive. As this
advertisement is genuine, the strictest

pleted. References will be given to
the most detailed answers, which are
to be addressed to--
(but for further particulars, says
Mr. Punch, see his respected
contemporary, the M.H.)
With one or two hard condi.
tions excepted, the nobleman of
distinguished appearance offers
liberal terms. “The lady must be fair ;” and this is rather hard upon the brunettes.
Had black eyes not been objectionable, slr. Punch—but purely as a matter of disinterested
benevolence-could have introduced a young lady of the Hebrew prejudice, a budding
rose of Sharon to the nobleman, whilst at the same time Mr. Punch would have handed
over the sum "from £2,000 to £3,000" to that invaluable body, the Society for the Con-
version of Houndsditch and Holywell-street. Again, what will be considered adequate in
the way of fortune? If a marquis, must the lady bring £10,000 per annum; if an earl,
may she be happy yet, if she can only muster £8,000? These are really hard times, when
rank has fallen so low that, without sinking the offal, aristocracy is so ready to sell itself at so
much in the pound.

Walking Eastward up the Strand;

Yea, but shepherds, what may I
Know the dome of HUMBUG by ?
Shepherds, kindly tell me what
Signs depote the hallowed spot ?
Crowds of votaries who wait,
Thronging round the Temple gate,
Over whom sleek HUMBUG reigns,
Serious nymphs and solemn swains.
Are they, then, so clearly seen
By their countenance and mien ?
May they be so surely known,
By their garb, for HUMBUG's own?
By their visages severe
Nymphs and swains revealed appear;
These in black with ties of white,
Those in saddest hues bedight.
Thanks, kind shepherds-now I'll go

And the Sabbatarians spout.

the people were satisfied with the existing state

eloquent upon the misery of a young Duke who
might be entrapped into wedlock by a lady of
objectionable morals, and LORD ABERDEEN re-
torted that objectionable morals were more
frequently found in young Dukes--it may be
supposed that he knows his order better than a
pardenu does. LORD LYNDHURST shed edifying
tears of compassion over virtuous and injured
wives; and finally the CHANCELLOR'S Bill, which
was the
mildest thing in the world, its chief
feature being the constituting a new Court to
sit in divorce matters (not the least relief being
given to the wife-not even the allowing her a
hearing before condemning her) was referred
to a select committee. Scotch eagerness to
catch wives may be deemed balanced by English
reluctance to let them go when caught.

but it was not stated whether they are to be equally in the way by

was brought up, and even LORD MALMESBURY could see its absurdity.
Some discussion followed on the state of our relations with America.
LORD ELGIN, who deserves to be listened to with respect, said that we
were wrong in supposing the Americans hostile to us, that our real
enemies in the States were disreputable Irishmen, and that kind of ex-
ported article, and that we ought to be careful not to excite ill-feeling
on the part of the real Americans. LORD CLARENDON assured the
House that the English Government had acted towards that of America
in the most gentlemanly manner, and that we could get no answer to
its offer to refer the Central American question to arbitration.
In the Commons there was discussion respecting a MR. ALLAN
POLLOK, a rich proprietor of Irish estates, who has been clearing away
a mass of his tenantry, for the purpose of adopting a new system of
cultivation. There was the usual conflicting evidence," as there
always is in disputes between sailors, Jews, and members of Parliament,
one side asserting that MR. POLLOK was a wise and humane man, who
was successfully aiming at the improvement of his estates and his
tenants, and the other contending that he was an oppressive ejector and
that his system would ruin both himse'f and his dependants. MR.
MIALL, the Dissenting member for Rochdale, and editor of the Noncon-
formist, then opened the return match with Exeter Hall, in payment for
Maynooth. He brought on a motion for taking away the whole pro-
perty of the Irish Church. The debate was brief, but animated, and
the motion was rejected by 163 to 93. The Reverend MR. NEWDEGATE

Quoth she, “Offer me gunpowder !
Unsavoury devotion ?”
And as the fires roared louder,
And the smoke clouds surged like an ocean,
With hasty grace from before her face,
She swept them with angry motion,
“The Heavens where I bold sitting,
Should be purer, and calmer, and brighter;
Perfumes for me unfitting
Are sulphur and charcoal, and nitre.
Sans fireworks your glee had been sweeter to me,
And the bill io pay the lighter!”
And with an impatient gesture
She shot up from the tower,
And the gleam of ber silvery vesture
Was brighter than the shower
Of rocket, and wheel, and gerb, and shell,
Which, that night, blazed their little bour.
A BRASS BAND OF HEROES.
1. The Mons. JULLIEN has been at bis labours, and the result of
his labour may be told in the words Nascitur ridiculus mus-ic. The
following paragraph from a provincial paper tells its own story, and a
precious story it must be considered :-
"JULLIEX'S FESTIVAL CONCERT.-In introducing the Trumpeters of the Second
Regiment of Zouaves, rendered so illustrious by their heroic deeds of daring courage
in Africa and the Crimea, M. JULLIEN feels assured that their performances will be
attended with far greater interest than attaches itself to the efforts of any band, how-
ever numerous and well organi-ed. Trained in hardship, and under the sun of an
African sky, their aspect, combining the ferocity of the savage with the lofty bearing
of the soldier, defies description. The shrill sound of the clarions harmonises fitly
with the peculiar character of the tribe. The notes produced from their trumpets
number but four, nevertheless their magic influence excels all that imagination could
realise. These men are now enrolled under the bâton of MONSIEUR JULLIEN, who will
present them glowing with the laurels gathered at Alma and on the ramparts of
Sebustopol."
The above announcement is the first that has reached us of those
heroic deeds of daring courage in Africa and the Crimea, which these
musicians are alleged to have performed. We cannot exactly under-
stand how a trumpet can be made the medium of anything like a
decisive blow on the field of battle; nor do we see the necessity of an
extra puff for gentlemen who are no doubt quite capable of blowing
their own trumpet with sufficient vigour. We doubt wherber their
attraction will be enhanced by the fact, that their "aspect." combines
"the ferocity of the savage," with "the lofty bearing of the soldier."
Tne ferocity of a band at a concert is almost as much out of place as
the fierceness sometimes imputed to a blind horse in a dust-cart. If
"the shrill sound of the clarions harmonises fitly with the peculiar cha-
racter of the tribe," we should say that the disagreeable quality called
"screeching" must be the “characteristic" of those musical barbarians.
The promise of the Mons. JULLIEN to "present these men, glowing
with the laurels gathered at Alma, and on the ramparts of Sebas-
topol,” can only be fulfilled by smothering the trumpe ers with ever.
greens, when they take their places in the orchestra. As they are now
"enrolled under the báton of Mons. JULLIEN," who is a musical Field-
Marsbal in his own right, and assumes the bâton by virtue of his rank,
we presume that the Second Regiment of Zouaves can dispense with
the heroes in question. We hope they will play appropria e airs, and
we recommend Suoave imagine as a piece which the Zouaves may
succeed in “conscientiously rec.dering.'

Having thus relieved his mind, in some degree, and being
slightly better, Mr. Punch proceeds to congratulate his

Prophets foretold everything but the Winner. The Sunday

anything about the matter. They had “fancies," and
“stable secrets,” and “vaticinations, and all the rest of
the jargon, but did they tell you, as Mr. Punch did, the
name of the horse that won ? No!
Mr. Punch stated, the week before the Derby, that it
would be won by Ellington.
He did not insult the understanding of his readers by
blurting out the fact in a bald and unseemly manner, but
he nobly remarked that the INITIAL LETTER OF THE WINNER'S

MAWKISH SENTIMENT.
'DEAR PUNCH, - You like a bit of nonsense,
I believe. What do you think of this ?
“A man told me that he didn't consider that a
criminal ought to be hanged for a foul murder,
because we do not bang a scoundrel for å
ruinous fraud.
“I demolished this preposterous opinion by
observing that loss of property is nothing to loss
of human life.
“This booby then asked, why we were ready
at any time to go to war on a question of pro-

reply; but I remarked that war is a different
thing from murder, He demanded, in what
respect? Well, I said, war is fair killing; mur.
der is unfair. So then, concluded my stupid
friend, you bang for the unfairness, not for the

right to hang a rogue, as to execute an assassin.

A RECENT CORRESPONDENCE,
(NON-OFFICIAL.)
HIS GRACE THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANT to the RIGHT HON. THE
LORD P-LM-RST-N.
MY LORD, -Let me bope you 'll"excuse this intrusion
On your occupied time, but the Bishops declare-
" If the Bands are not stopt, that the utmost confusion
Must arise”-so they wish me to bid you beware.
To Lambeth LORDS BLANDFORD and SHAFTESBURY hurried,
Declaring that Exeter Hall was in arms :
In short, my dear Lord, I can't say how I'm worried,
Since such proof has been given that “Music has charms."
They tell me "the Church is in danger of falling,"..
To my ears LORD R. GROSVENOR no respite will grant;
Whilst the threats of Dissenters are really appalling;
So pray, stop the music,
Yours, ever, J. CANT.
When the Band of the Blues for the Parks is provided,
Your Grace writes me word that “this cannot be borne;”
But ihe Queen's band at Windsor may play on unchided,
And you wink when the Coldstreams are hired at Cremorne.
To that Cockney Elysium, its gates open throwirg,
On each Sunday night scores of revellers come;
While the music flows on with the tap ever flwing,
Yet your Grace and Right Reverend Bretbren are dumb.
When the people observe such strange twists in your teaching,
I fear they may think your religion a sham,
By the light of your practice interpret your preaching,
And deem it all “Cant,” so believe me, Yours, Pam.

A PEOPLE SINGULAR AND PLURAL,
ACCORDING to M. UBICINI, persons of the Roumanic race, when
asked, What country they belong to ? are accustomed to reply,
Roman." This answer, being interpreted, is “I am a Romao;" but
would not "I are a Roman " be the more accurate translation ? Per-
haps an ancient Roman of the lower orders was sometimes guilty of
saying Civis Romanus sunt, and the vulgarism in question may have
descended from the ancient Romans to the modern Romains. We
apprehend that in countries inbabited by a Roumanic population, the
birch-tree does not flourish, or if it does, that the schoolmaster is not
abroad in those regions. We suspect accidence to be unknown even
in the best regulated Roumanic families. Certainly these Romains
appear to have very confused ideas of Latin Grammar; and they bave
so corrupted the Roman tongue as to have converted it into a dialect
wbich our own inferior classes would be justified in denominating a
Rummish lingo.
THE RIGHT HON. THE LORD P-LM-RST-N to His GRACE THE
ARCHBISHOP OF CANT.
MY LORD, -In reply to your Grace's last letter,
So full of distress, I must beg to remark,
That I capno conceive any anodyne better
To quiet the Town than a Band in the Park.
I cannot agree that such sweet recreation
Can “endanger the Church,” and you 'll argue in vain
If you try to persuade me the whole British nation
Can be turned from their Church by a musical strain.
Look at home, my dear Lord! and observe every morning,
At your own Palace-gates on the all-ballowed day,
How the gin-shops are thronged-yet you bid me take warning,
When I try with a Band to draw drinkers away!
The New Cut” in Lambeth is open all Sunday,
Avd buyers and sellers resort to its fair;
No distinction is drawn between that day and Monday
Wby so silent, my Lord, on the wickedness there?
A Diplomatic Note.-Immediate.
MR. JOHN BULL presents his compliments to MR. DALLAS, and begs
to say that, although MR. CRAMPTON may have packed up his things

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EAU, EAU, WHAT CAN
THE MATTER BE ?
In imitation of the Wine Congress recently beld in
France, it is proposed that a Water Congress
should be
celebrated by the Tee-totallers in London. The object
would naturally be to decide on the quality of the various
waters supplied by the different Companies to the aquatic
amateurs of the Metropolis. There are several water-
drinkers in London, who have cultivated their taste to
such a nicety, that they can recognise the peculiar smack
of a particular cistern, and there are connoisseurs who can,
after imbibing a few pints of fluid, give the date of the
water-butt from which it has been extracted.
There is no mistaking the rare old odour of genuine
Thames, but there are some rivers which can only be
recognised by a highly educated connoisseurship, and in-
deed, there are instances in which mere ordinary ditch-water
has been confounded with the produce of a popular reservoir.
Some amateurs object to the woody taste of water from the
butt, and there are some who are such regular fanatici
per la acqua, that they would run a mile for a pull at a
particular pump, and some have been known to drink their
gallon at a foreign table d'hôte when the water has been
supplied from a fountain they bave taken a liking to.

BRITISH EXCLUSIVES AT ROME.
The Roman correspondent of the Morning Post, in allu-
sion to a certain artist who has quitted painting for
diplomacy, makes the following remark :-
“ It is now a question here, whether MR. TOERMER's official position
will make him eligible as a Member of the English club in the Via Con-
dotti, where English gentlemen exclade artists as unworthy the honour
of their presence."
We wonder if these gentlemen would have excluded
MR. R. S. D'URBINO, or MR. M. ANGELO, as unworthy
the honour of their presence;." and, if so, whether the
exclusion would have been dictated by a vulgar pride, or
suggested by a refined humility. For, perhaps, the gentle-
men exclude artists as being too good company for such
common fellows in respect of intellect as themselves, and
consider, not the artists to be unworthy of the honour of
their presence, but themselves to be unworthy of the honour
of the presence of the artists.

to her with something nice for supper.

length his age, independence, the state of his whiskers, and his general position in

MR. GRUNDY,—To make inquiries into the circumstance of a policeman being found

servants at supper, it would not have been much easier for him to have rung the
kitchen-bell?
Miss ABABELLA GBUNDY,–To move for copies of the correspondence that papa says

Of our manifest destiny, Sir, my conviction
Might betray me perhaps into unadvised diction,
And to you, touching WALKER, I could not state fiction.
At a rupture with England I truly should grieve.
In religion and blood on each side of the water
United, how sad one another to slaughter,
It would be like a battle of mother and daughter.
What I've spoken to BUNCOMBE may BUNCOMBE believe.
MR. PIERCE TO BUNCOMBE.
With the purest of motives—the best of intentions
That could pavé a location which nobody mentions,
I have stirred and fomented our present dissensions,
(May they not end in bloodshed by land and by sea !)
With the Britishers' insolent Administration,
In defence of the honour and rights of our pation;
From my heart do I make this sincere declaration,
As a Christian and Patriot, BUNCOMBE, to thee.

In recruiting, for England, to CRAMPTON, detected,
It was no-ways from wishing to get re-elected.
O BONCOMBE, my hand on my bosom I lay.
The path of ambition I never would follow
A goblet of poison I rather would swallow,
As I slap my heart, bark! dost thou hear it sound hollow ?
Illustrious BONCOMBE, stand forth, Sir, and say.
No; neutrality bonestly bent on preserving,
In the straight path of justice persistent, unswerving,
No base purpose of party intent upon serving,
I have taken the course I thought proper to take.
Of the name of my country I'm jealous and tender;
An account, MR. BUNCOMBE, I've one day to render;
As to CRAMPTON, the man was a signal offender;
And of him I felt bound an example to make.
What, to hire our free swords and republican rifles!
Such insults as these, Sir, who dares to call trifles ?
Indignation and scorn he amongst us who stifles,
Is a miscreant, loafer, a scoundrel, and slave!
To enlist in a foreign war what is upjuster,
Excepting recruits for such service to muster ?
I forbear now to mention the word filibuster;
Discussion on that subject, BUNCOMBE, we'll waive.
SHOCKING BAD.
We are continually meeting with some pleasant bit of gossip in the
columns of our melodious contemporary, the Musical World, which last
week treated us with the following bit of anything but dry.” reading :
" STOCKHOLM.—A short time since, as HERR A. DREYSCHOCK was landing from a
steamboat, he had the misfortune to miss his footing, and fall into the water. Luckily,
however, he was promptly extricated from his dangerous position without any serious
results further than the shock, and a thorough wetting."
We congratulate the HERR upon having got off without any
further inconvenience than the "shock;” though it is probable that
DREYSCHOCK must have found the wet-shock rather disagreeable. We
should not be so unfeeling as to attempt a joke upon the subject, bad
the accident been attended with serious results ; but, under the cir-
cumstances, we may be excused for hinting to the HERR—who is an
accomplished musician-the necessity for being more careful in future;
to avoid all superfluous cadences; and to be sure, that in a descending
passage, he clearly sees his way up again.

A FORTUNE FOR HALF-A-CROWN.
We ought not to wonder at the wealth of this country, with its long
lines of magnificent residences, and its rows of splendid equipages;
for, in fact, the only surprising thing in England, is its poverty, if we
are to believe one MR. ALFRED Roy, who tells us that a fortune is to
be had for two-and-sixpence. We have seen a circular issued in the
name of this individual, and as publicity is doubtless bis object, we
are happy, in a double sense of the words, to give it him. We feel
some reluctance to afford much of our space to such a subject, but we
can only show the length to which certain things can be carried by
printing the whole of the following: -
TO THOSE
REQUIRING EMPLOYMENT.
MR. ALFRED ROY
Has great pleasure in announcing to those in want of Employment, that
he has succeeded in making some very valuable discoveries, by means of
which, he is now enabled to place the means of earning a handsome income
within the reach of all. The discoveries made by A. R. have these advan-
tages over all others, viz: that they can be acted upon by every one, no
matter what their station in life; the capital required to start with is so
small, that it can be raised by almost any one; the employment is suitable
for either male or female, and can be carried on either during the day-time
or in the evening, in town or country. Now comes the most extraordinary
part of the business; any one having a capital of ONE SOVEREIGN to start
with, can, by adopting A. R.'s method, make an income of from £2 to £4
weekly, this will seem absolutely impossible to most people, but when
they read the printed instructions which A. R. is ready to forward, they
will be immediately convinced not ouly of the PROBABILITY of wealth being
within their rencb, but also of the CERTAINTY of such being the case. The
plan is alike remarkable for its simplicity and the case with which it can be
adopted. All in want of money, no matter whether the ignorant or well
informed, should immediately make application for this valuable and
extraordinary information,-information which can only be obtained from
one person, and that person ALFRED ROY, who feels assured that all
who act upon his advice, will congratulate themselves upon their good
fortune, and consider their adviser as their best friend, and entitled to their
everlasting gratitude. A. R., in conclusion, begs again to call attention to
the fact, that the employment is suitable either for the poor man or women,
or the polished gentleman or lady.
A GOLDEN LEGEND.
Louis NAPOLEON has gained lately an accession of popularity by
visiting the scenes of the recent inundations in France, and distributing
money to the sufferers. This is all very right, and flattery must needs
put in its word of fulsome exaggeration, and has cast ridicule on a
proceeding that would otherwise have been perfectly respectable. One
of the Imperial adulators states that "the French EMPEROR, seeing
one woman more clamorous than the rest," put several pieces of gold
into her hand, exclaiming, “There, my good woman, that will buy you
bread;" just as the old benevolent barons used to do in the old British
melodramas.
It is a libel on Louis NAPOLEON to impute to him such a piece of
indiscriminating profusion as would have been practised if be really
went about placing "gold" in the hands of the foremost and the
most clamorous of those who could by main force get the nearest to
him in his progress. Such conduct would be worthy of the foolish old
father in the farce, who exclaims, " Take her, you rogue, with my
blessing, and thirty thousand pounds,” to the “gent” who has been
practising all sorts of fraud to win his daughter; or the alleged act of
unmeaning lavishness might be compared to that of the dramatic
poble who throws guilders broad-cast among the chorus-singers who
hail his return to his estate with a loud la la la, and a ballet. We
think the Moniteur should be instructed to deny the charge contained
in the report to which we have alluded.
The Following are A. Ki's Terms.
Each person requiring his information, must forward the sum of 2s.6d.
either by money order or postage stamps (money order preferred) and at the
same time, must faithfully promise to send him at least one-half of the first
week's profits. A. R. trusts that no one will forget the latter part of the
engagement, as all must be well aware that the small sum of 25. 6d. will
scarcely repay him for his trouble; but his object being to place his plan
within the reach of every one, he feels compelled merely to make a small
charge in the first instance, and depend on the generosity of his friends for his
future reward. Those persons who wish to avail themselves of the present
splendid opportunity of making money, can address (enclosing a fee of
28. 6d.) to MR. ALFRED ROY, Orchard House, Clapton, London.
Each applicant is requested to enclose a directed envelope, with two

MORAL FOR THE TOILET.
At the banquets of the old Egyptians there was one
constant guest; namely, that remainder of humanity which
some of our venerable women who minister in sick
chambers are accustomed to denominate an Ottomis. This
word is a modification of “Anatomy,” understood in the
sense of skeleton-and the skeleton, or mummy, a model
of which, at least, was present at Egyptian festivals, was
intended as a memento mori-to remind beholders of the
brevity of life, and suggest the propriety of improving
the present occasion, by eating and drinking as much as
possible.
We do not introduce skeletons at a Lord Mayor's feast
-or even at a hospital dinner; but, in a certain sense, the
idea of the old Egyptian skeleton has been adopted in our
fashionable society; for an advertisement in the Post
announces that
"Les JUPONS CLOCHETTE ET SQUELETTE"
are to be obtained at a certain " Magazin pour Broderie,
Lingerie, et Articles Confectionnés." So now, young ladies
- some of them at least-carry about them two skeletons
instead of one. The jupon squelette was, of course, designed
by the modiste who invented it to remind the fair wearer
of the fact of the existence of the osseous ditto, which the
loveliest organisation contains, &c., and to impress her with
a sense of the importance of wearing as many pretty
dresses, and going to as many evening-parties as possible,
during the brief season of existence.
As the jupon is an under-garment, the moral which it
intimates can only benefit the individual whom it invests.
The squelette pattern might be extended to the robe, or
outer-dress, with much advantage ; it would then constitute
a practical invitation to the unthinking Swell to waltz while
he can.

A Fair Exchange.

A ROYAL ROUNDABOUT.
THERE are some people who can do nothing in a straight-
forward manner, and who can ask you to dinner one day,
put you off the next, give you a half invitation a month
afterwards, and then drop the affair altogether, as if they
never intended to give you any dinner at all. This is
generally considered shabby enough in private life, or
rather unceremonious treatment, to say the least of it, but
we hardly expect to find such a practice adopted on the
part of one sovereign towards another.
That such has been the case, however, appears by an
extract from a recent letter of the Times' correspondent at
Berlin, who writes as follows :-
“ It is whispered that the King has sent to the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA,
through PRINCE WINDISCHGRATZ, an invitation, or something amounting
to one, to come to the autumn manæuvres here."
Woo! SNIMVNG
If we were the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA we would see the
SALSEVW UH
King of Prussia and his “manæuvres” further, or rather
we would not see him at all, if he could not tell us in an
open, honest manner that he would be glad to see us,
instead of dropping a hint of an “invitation," or "some-
thing amounting to one,” which would bave left us in a
state of ambiguity as to whether we had been asked or
not asked to give the honour of our company. We almost
wonder that WINDISCHGRATZ, who ought in future to be
called SIDE WINDISCHGRATZ, did not get a flea in his ear
when he had the temerity to attempt the dirty work of
hinting a balf-invitation to an Emperor. AUSTRIA might
well say, “If your master really wants me, why don't he
say so, instead of dropping bis vague hints, wbich will
enable him to get out of it if he should change his mind,
and wish to put me off again."
It seems, however, that the Royal family of Prussia,
cannot for the life of them, avoid an underhand mode of
going to work; for the following extract from the corre-
spondence we have already quoted, gives another instance

DOGGED DETERMINATION.
The Court of Queen's Bench was occupied during a whole day last
week, in trying the right to a Ferry between the Isle of Dogs and Green-
wich. An immense amount of documentary evidence was read, including
a quantity of the old law, with its usual amount of “dog Latin," wbich
was supposed to bear special reference to the Isle alluded to. It is
difficult to understand the value of a Ferry between the two places
named; for, though many wish to visit Greenwich, few desire to go to
the Dogs, for even the most temporary purposes. We are not learned
in the antiquities of the Isle; but archæology might probably discover
some pretext for the name of the place in the remains of some old
Dogano, of which the Isle of Dogs may have been the site at some
remote period.
